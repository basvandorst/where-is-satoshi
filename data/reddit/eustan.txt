Well, it does but I'm also interested in a new more decentralization-friendly PoW. But a question here is why would part of current ASCI miners mine on the SegWit chain when the new or modified PoW is disadvantageous to them.
One thing that bothers me here is that a change in rules clearly introduced with the idea to get the SegWit vote passed, would seem problematic. 
On the other hand maybe this is a great opportunity to change PoW and introduce SegWit in one go, even at the price of making a controversial hard fork.

On this reddit it'd be off topic to discuss who may have attacked BU but in any case I don't think a great majority of people here deny BU's right to run their code (when/if they respect the license and release source code). 
My point is Bitcoin Core didn't call for, plan or threaten attacks, whereas BU did.

You're right - I didn't meant that (influencing a government, because bitcoin hasn't got one), but helping other influence the bitcoin governance process using methods that don't follow customary procedures.

Without the ability to coerce you have zero power, so what pressure can you possibly apply in such a situation? It's not like Luke is a friend of family member who you can pressure to get a haircut or else he won't be invited to the next BBQ party. 
Another way to explain it: the freedom of speech gives him the liberty to refuse to listen to what you have to say. So before you enter your moral agent mode we can state with absolute certainty that your message of discouragement won't make it to the other side and there's nothing, short of coercion, that can make you even begin to try to discourage him.

A problem (now) is with all the talk about the change to PoW, it'd be extremely risky to engage in development of a new ASIC.

Storj has larger problems than BTC tx fees so let's ignore their example (especially since SW actually addresses their alleged problems).
For the likes of Dell it's not surprising - BTC doesn't have to be banned to become useless for business transactions. It only has to be made enough inconvenient and expensive to use and that's exactly what various governments and central banks have been working on. What else did you expect?
Unpermissioned use is and has always been where real opportunities are.

It's not an advice, but an opinion.


Really? It appears to me that my un-edited comment above still says that P2P hubs will work just fine (unpermissionless) while those who want to engage in government-sanctioned business can choose to lobby (pay off the lawmakers to permit them to operate) or, in absence of that, simply outsource hub operation to larger financial companies who have the ability to buy laws that work for them but kill their smaller competitors.

Interesting idea, but I'm not sure whether it'd have desired effect.
I liked Ver's "coin base subsidy/bribe" idea (reward BU miners for each block). 
If there was a way to buy from SW signaling pools, I would create buy orders that pay 1% over the going rate.
It would be easy to see whether SW pools sell the same amount of BTC the mine. For non-opinionated and SW-favoring pools this would be a non-brainer (I hope).
Is that what you want to achieve, reward SW miners?

Numbers-wise UASF support is alread bigger than BU support.

This would require a bit more thinking and analysis but I would say mining could become significantly less profitable because the number of transactions would drop (it can't go up anyway) while other uses of electricity could become very profitable (say, increased local food production due to interrupted foreign trade).
It is also possible albeit probably less likely that mining would become more lucrative than it is today. For example the government of China bans mining as it wants to use all electricity for state-mandated production of (something).
Because there are many variables in these equations the best and simplest strategy is contained in the article: own both hard money and cryptocurencies.

You can always sell your "BU" BTC if they take over. 


Why? In case BU wins, you can still sell your coins. 
There's some risk, but for me it's not significant enough to choose inaction over it and wait until someone else decides for me. Even if BTC I hold lose 90% of value.
If SW transactions become significant, BU-leaning but still undecided miners are more likely to defect. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:48:05
What's sad is the poor understanding of the situation (and voluntarism) demonstrated in the OP.
Voluntarism isn't about the greater good or morality but about property rights.
BTC should conduct a USAF once SW hits 51% because clearly BU has no intention of waiting until they get to 95%.
The 95% rule is (as it turns out) too strict and Core is correctly not attempting to change the rule after the fact, but BTC users have the full right to protect their property, so UASF is justified.
@_date: 2017-03-29 08:29:23
Sure it's a possibility, but tell me why would they bother with this BU PR nonsense when they could stealthily acquire all BTC using less than 1% of their foreign currency reserves? Or spend even less to acquire 20% of the hash power and take BU over the 50% hash power.
tl;dr: It's a possibility, but there's zero proof and no economic sense or justification.
@_date: 2017-03-12 07:37:37
Define "processing" and "bitcoin payments".
It depends. As alienshapes said there's no security in RPC stack so you need (read the docs) to take care of that. 
But if you already determined (I wonder how, maybe you thought that's something cool?) that you "need" to prune, then why not run bitcoin in the prune mode on all sites?
Also if it's pruned, it's not full.
Most likely, it's unfeasible.

@_date: 2017-03-29 13:29:03

If the correlation exists, then it can be equally exploited by everyone, but chiefly the BU miners because they know before others... 
Personally I'd rather use my approach, short BU coin and buy the same amount from SW miners at a small premium.

Willing participation is "fair" participation.
Some won't do it, but for the most part they will be able to continue to provide existing services.
A minority's services don't make as much sense without SW support, but they don't have to upgrade (which is "fair") if they don't think their investment in SW related development can get the same or better ROI than current investments.

There's a fair amount of related literature about widespread corruption in government that prevents innovation and harms the people, for example check libertarian literature on the FDA.
I would say the key distinguishing characteristic is "permissionless". Bitcoin isn't nearly as convenient as credit cards, PayPal or centralized web sites (for services related to Bitcoin but unrelated to payments), and "trustless" is the second. The both fix problems created by governments, so definitively these are things that libertarians feel Bitcoin can provide.
I would say that the libertarians views aren't just views but rather truths, because the appeal is obvious to all (not just libertarian) and the tremendous resources the community (not just libertarian) has put into developing Bitcoin shows that these characteristics are highly valued. 
And finally, if any government had the slightest chance or ability to function in such a manner, it would have happened by now. Instead they are now stealing even more money from the people to fund "blockchain innovation" - completely laughable as barely 2-3 years after it started it is already obvious the only result of this spending will be less freedom, more surveillance and more taxation. Virtually all "innovation" is centered around "war on cash" and creating or maintaining regulatory hurdles on free markets.

I know, but (for example) before the globalist scum entered full-retard mode, Swiss and some other private banks provided excellent privacy.
There's no reason why small private bitcoin banks/hubs couldn't do the same. There are mail, VPN, hosting and other services that accept bitcoin and are operated by respected individuals or groups. The same ought to be possible for LN hubs.

1. Doubt about future block size increases isn't a reason against SegWit.
2. In fact, as it was pointed out a million times, no block size can be large enough if everything is recorded on the blockchain.
3. Political sense, as clearly demonstrated by recent events, wasn't a good excuse as it's worked decidedly against those who've been against SegWit (and they're lucky that they're failing this way because it's not the worst outcome for those who are blocking SW adoption).

Thanks for making an effort to put this in numbers.
I agree with your analysis and I believe it's highly likely he and/or Ver shorted the crap out of BTC in recently months and additionally they're in the best position to buy a crapload of BTC before they decide to "compromise". 
(Most if not all exchanges these days keep transaction records so if lawsuits happen it's gonna be fun).
This is a great opportunity to do whatever it takes - even if it causes a 90% crash - to get rid of these oligarchs and fix centralization problems that have been unaddressed for too long.

It goes both ways, and there's no coercion in either case. You don't have to use either or any of the coins if there's a fork.

You don't need to "support" them, you can run one or the both. I will run the both. But functionally they are the same as long as BU doesn't win so once it's stable you may as well choose UASF.
Core likely won't merge the patch because it'd be seen as cheating (against the rules).

If you can get away with it, maybe you can address the biggest issue since almost Year 1, the government.
(Come to think of it, we can't prove but we can reasonably conclude, that at least some government employees, prior to making significant decisions about bitcoin, insider-trade on that information).
A simple look at the state of Bitcoin is enough to conclude that because of government interference it's realized maybe 5% of its potential, and that most "investment" in this space is aimed not at creating useful blockchain applications but at creating conditions for new blockchain rentieerism. Half a decade has been wasted because of this nonsense and we can already see where it's going (with IBM and various Permissioned Distributed Crap Ledgers)

As I explained in other comments on this page, any exchange can quote prices in bits or whatever makes their buyers (and sellers) happy. 
But other exchanges would still use BTC. So you're asking that all exchanges change to (say) bits, while Bitcoin Core still uses BTC. How does that help? You buy 30 ($UNITs), install Core, send BTC to yourself and then you realize you actually have 0.03 BTC. If you felt like shit before (being unable to buy 30 BTC or &gt; 1 BTC in any case), you'll feel like shit again because you'd actually have just 0.03 BTC.
The only way this Ponzi-like change could be made effective is to force a change in Bitcoin Core. And that would be totally insane, because any user who prefers BTC or any other unit would be pissed off and confused. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 15:35:24

Thing is, they can't force us to adopt anything. It's merely a suggestion which we can ignore ad infinitum.
I don't know why these stupid calls for "adoption" of a different unit appear all the time.

B&amp;B cycles do exist, but they're not a phenomenon related to BTC. They're a credit-driven phenomenon. BTC isn't a fractional reserve currency and any lending is for all practical purposes non-existent. 
There is a lot of speculation and personally I dislike that, but again, it mostly impacts speculators and not all users. If you buy (or sell) a little every month, only monster-sized drops and rises should worry you. (Actually even big jumps in the price of bitcoin shouldn't really worry you yet, because almost no one borrows bitcoin.)

Tell me how is this widespread adoption of a smaller unit supposed to work? It's *easy* to see there are 2 possibilities:
* User-configured preference: I leave my unit as BTC, you use whatever your wallet supports. Result: nothing to discuss or "adopt" - everyone uses what they like.
* Core-driven change: 1 BTC becomes 1 HMBTC (hundred million BTC), 1 Satoshi becomes 1 BTC. Who in their sane mind would want something like this?

But you can do that already, that's my point.
You can't *force* the seller (including exchanges) to quote a price in bits (or all made-up shit-units out there). You can ask them to make it possible to set your preferred unit and then you'll see prices in bits (and some other guy will see them in shit-units of his choosing, maybe 1 4/10 Mbits, for those who prefer that). 
The world can't **default** to bits without fucking up everyone else (including users who prefer any **other** fractional unit).
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:01:15
SW blocks, genius
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:03:10
But you **can** use bits if you want - just get a wallet that supports it.
Why do we even need to know (or care) what unit you set in your wallet preferences?
Whoever can't use BTC as units can use a wallet or buy from sellers that display prices in units you prefer. 
Personally I don't want to see prices in other units because that way I don't have to learn other units.

He's talking about the fact that a 300x higher fiat price of BTC would make your $0.15 transaction fee be $45.

I don't mind that people celebrate and make money (or BTC), I'm just saying they could improve experience of all users by celebrating in comments of price-post-of-the-day. 
Strictly speaking, one could even claim such posts violate this sub's guidelines (duplicate content). I don't think that "Whoa, $3,700!!!" and  "Whoa, $3,714.35!!!" are different posts. Having said that, I never report these posts to moderators although I do hope they did their job better.
Edit: I just checked. Right now I can't see **a single** non-price post in "Hot" without scrolling. There's 2 posts pinned by the mod followed and 7 "to the moon" shitposts below that and that's all I can see without scrolling on my HD monitor.

That's a Ponzi strategy central banks are using to plunder the people and make them spend.
Bitcoin was made to be hard (digital) money and a store of value, and not some feel-good get rich quick pyramid scheme.
You can customize your display units any way you want (1 Bernank = 0.1 Satoshi), but how does that help someone? They will still own just 1 Bernank aka 1 billionth part of BTC.

I agree. Schiff has been wrong so far, but I also think Bitcoin is in a bubble.
And the relative resilience of Bcash shows that "close clones" aren't as impossible as practically everyone here used to claim.
One paradox related to this claimed impossibly of multiple "Bitcoins" is that although they're thought impossible, most Bcash and 2X-related comments on this sub have been extremely negative and even hostile. This is illogical because it is widely assumed that any clones or hardforks can't survive.
I participated in UASF but unlike most commenters I was never against clones and forks (I was and still am against SW2X's takeover attempt). And I own both some Bitcoin and previous metals. No alts.

Yes. But I mean you can still enter BTC with $5 (or $3). 
The mistake IMO is that people think they should be able to buy the same amount of "BTC" (maybe in a new denomination) for $3 like it was possible 6 years ago.

@_date: 2017-08-02 12:34:02
BCH/BCC can easily work with most BTC apps and a lot of users already have it. 
It's got a lot of downsides (I sold mine, by the way), but the price reflects it's got some life in it. You could say why people need any other Top 10 coin. Technically most folks don't need more than 1, but yet there's a ton of them.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:02:11
I sold mine for a similar price without much strategizing. I could have squeezed out a bit more but what the hell.
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:44:38
Correct. 
I've been downvoted quite a lot for my permissive attitude in comments related to Bitcoin Cash, but in the end it doesn't matter - the market decides.
I actually like that BCC managed to survive (so far at least) because some Bitcoiners here are vicious statists who opposed BCC with various anti-free market arguments (which included misunderstandings about trademarks and how permissive open source works).

@_date: 2017-08-02 15:26:23
There hasn't been a successful "clone" yet. But for now, at least, you can liquidate your BTC at the combined price of the both (BCC and BTC). 
It's true that the price is helped by those factors such as small volume, but if you hold a handful of coins and can trade you don't feel the fact that there's only 100,000 BCC (BCH) on the market). At the same time that's rarely true for BTC - not all BTC out there are up for sale.
I think BCC can survive and take LTC's place. It's no threat to BTC. I'm not interested in owning it, but it doesn't bother me.

B) If Expedia discovers they overrefunded you they will be able to sue to get their money back. While you can bet they won't discover, you would also be betting against the rise in price of BTC/BCH (in case you have to pay back in crypto; I don't know how Expedia works)
This is a good example of how crypto payments often destroy value in permissioned economy. 
I recently paid for Expedia stuff with credit card and it worked well. It didn't even occur to me to try to use crypto.

Yes. Of course if you gather them in Step 1, you just move the transactions to before the fork rather than after the fork (and avoid having to use the Exchange's fees), but that's a good idea for another reason - after the fork blocks will (at least initially) be slower and congestion higher.

I'm not convinced it's something you can buy and leave just sit there, without checking the price or news about "forks" every few days. But so far it's been going up, so it's been unstable in a good way.

BCH doesn't need (I think most of them also don't really care or want) to "take over" Bitcoin. 
It's like a BTC Lite. You have a shit transaction that you want to confirm fast and be inexpensive? BCH does the job. 
We may argue new tech will help BTC get there, and I think it will, but when you see that even SW hasn't kicked in yet, it won't happen before 2019.
Will BCH not scale well? Probably. Their full node count will probably keep decreasing if the platform gets busy in terms of transactions. But they can keep going for years like that. Remember, it's a platform for shit transactions and after the EDA HF it will work fine.
I remain fully invested in BTC and I don't care what BCH does. I hope more Bitcoiners would go to BCH, so this spike in the price of BCH may be helpful to get rid of the fools whom we've onboarded in recent years.

I hope that illustrates that whatever info get here, it won't be enough. Normally once a person knows how BTC and the ecosystem works, they have 5-10 criteria they want their wallet and broker to meet. You won't (can't) know what they are unless you use BTC, so if you make your choice without doing at least a part of what I outlined above, you'll go through the whole procedure and pick some guy A, only to later discover they don't do one of 10 things you need and then you'll have to go through the whole procedure with some guy B. 
Good luck with Bitcoin!

If you already declare your crypto holdings and pay tax on that, it's fine. 
But imagine you bought at $400, now you do this arbitrage stuff and you've cashed out at $1,200 so technically you've got $800 of income and (depending on how much they tax you) that can easily wipe out your arbitration income unless you do it several times (which increases the risk and when it works, just adds to your income known to the government).
Maybe be OK for some folks, but not OK for others.

3rd: there's no way for all transactions to be on the blockchain, so something has to give. Higher miner fees, larger blocks, centralization, etc - pick your poison. 
Higher miner fees are not the worst choice. Not $100/tx, but $1/tx. We need to offload crap tx to crapchains.

I agree with that, it's a very small risk, but it is a risk that should be added to overall risk-reward calculation. 
We have a 10% potential gain on the one side and on the other you add (let's say) 2% for potential taxation of some sort, 2% for new issues with Bitfinnex (and the worst case is perhaps total loss), etc. it's not really a "no brainer."

Well, there are always debates whether some transactions are "necessary" or "spam".
The basic problem is needs are always unlimited, and resources are not. That's why there has to be a way to limit the use of resources - either a free market (competition) or a government (decrees) or some combination thereof (which gradually gravitates toward an un-free market).

Maybe you mis-read my earlier comment. Out of 11,000 climate research papers, less than 3% purport to show a link between human activity &amp; climate change.
97% don't. 
You align with the 3% and accuse others of aligning with the 97% and that makes you a Man of (Climate) Science. 
Based on your logic from the climate example, it seems the 25% of anti-SegWit experts may be right. 
Following the same climatist "best practice" if only Roger Ver subsidized or bribed a few more "experts", BU could become supported by "thousands" of (corrupt peer)-reviewed research papers. 
You can see from other comments that noone gives a crap about "experts". People are voting with their money (BTC) and free of coercion, which is what Bitcoin is all about.

What this has to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-04-19 05:12:15
No problem.
I understand you want an easier way, but there's no easier way. It takes an effort, at least in the current stage. If you take shortcuts, you will certainly lose BTC. 
Hardware wallets: you're wrong about that because you can buy two cheap ones and keep one as a backup somewhere. This is a minor detail but shows how you *think* you now something just because you read about it on the Interwebs whereas if you actually bought a h/w wallet and used it you'd *really* know how it works.
There are many factors when deciding how to do something, so unless you list out all the features in great detail (but you won't be able to do that if you're not familiar with Bitcoin), you'll just get wrong or at best approximate advice.
For example you ask about exchange rates. Yeah, you get them pretty much everywhere, but in many cases they're "fake", i.e. exchanges or brokers give you crappy rates and take a low (nominal) commission, so having access to exchange rates is quite useless. It may save you time, but not money. 
Then there's the compliance, which you haven't asked about, so why name wallets and brokers if compliance may (we don't know) be a show stopper for you. 
I never heard of "melting" in the context of bitcoin, sorry.

OK it's an FAQ: 
1) Create a new address offline (or online, as long as you can get the privkey for each new address). You could create a new address every now and then.
2) Sweep them from Mycelium using the private key from step 1)

Note that there addresses come in a compressed and uncompressed format.
Try the entire procedure (both steps) on testnet before you use "real" bitcoin.

Good point :-). Yes, that part is very different (from fiat).
I somehow don't like, or can't get used to, the fact that a paper wallet can be similar to cash under the mattress. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 05:17:05


Okay, fine. I'm not going to reinvent (or copy and paste some crap from Google) the wheel here but bitcoin cannot be counterfeit. 
Fiat can, is and will be. Even though neither has "inherent" value, the former cannot be confiscated or taxed. Maybe it's more risky to hold, but with taxes as high as they are and the ongoing war on cash, bitcoin is a great diversification tool.
Nobody can take my bitcoins. Nobody can tax my bitcoins. Nobody can tell me what I can and cannot buy with my bitcoins. 
Considering this, why the fuck would I want to hold more than a minimum amount of fiat, even if it doesn't lose any value?

Can't seem much intelligence in your reply.
For example, anybody who has an account with less KYC/AML-friendly exchanges knows that the level of checking for normal (few K USD) accounts is minimal.

You can find your transaction (look for the destination address that you sent the funds to) and see how large it was (blockchain.info). 
Let's say it was 0.4 KB, so the *lower* fee they set may be more reasonable, but if they don't return the difference (saving) to you then that is bullshit if set a *smaller* fee and put the savings to their own pocket.
The FAQ is kind of reasonable in cases where they *increase* the fee to a reasonable minimum in order to not spam the network with low fee transactions that will never confirm, but it doesn't explain why they don't return the funds when they override it to a lower value. 
Contact their support.

Bitcoin provides other utilities such as censorship-free and immutable storage for data (such as smart contracts, or tokens).
Users can't be expected to buy them entirely on demand, so you need just (for example) 210 million users to hold some pocket change of BTC and there's nothing left over for other stuff.
Settlement-wise if you use tokens then you don't need as much BTC but if you still have a counterparty risk (the token issuer may own hold enough gold to back the issuance, for example) so in reality many will want to to use both Bitcoin and bitcoin for payments because there is no counterparty risk.
By the way I don't like Selgin - he is completely wrong on gold and gets way too much publicity considering how clueless he is. It's a shame he is frequently interviewed as a free market economist which he isn't.
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:01:25
That's true in the sense a client shouldn't work with "wrong" nodes.
What I meant to say is a bad majority becomes the correct majority. The assumption of "correctness" is based on the assumption that miners are honest.
@_date: 2017-04-17 10:28:45
I think a good comparison would be bitcoin is protected by huge computational power, whereas fiat is protected by force (of the State).
The latter is much more expensive (although eco-morons regularly bitch about CO2 emissions of the former) and it attempts to secure both "in" and "out" (it both prevents counterfeiting and forces the populace to accept the currency), so Bitcoin's approach is vastly superior. 
Edit: just to clarify why this is a reply; fiat is backed by nothing but the State ensures that you'll accept it, so we could say that a fiat currency is backed by an implicit threat of force.

Occasional users read "Hot", while regular users read "New" so the effort dealing with (down-voting) the garbage falls on the regulars. Of course to Reddit and occasional users this is perfectly fine because regular users are their free spam filter (tedious work).

Maybe you can ask Reddit for a new feature - the Reverse Threshold setting - that would help folks easily access dissenting opinions.
Simple answer:
a) I understand the optimization is patented, which means others can't (legally) optimize
b) In this situation the optimization blocks protocol upgrades because if others are barred from optimizing there's simply no way they can reach 95% of the hashing power. (Even if you paid just a 1% loyalty you still couldn't compete.)
Your points about FPGA and ASICS are irrelevant here, as is the language used by Maxwell.

I'm not claiming PoW is "useless", but rather that unlike hard money ( BTC has no inherent value. 
For example you couldn't sit on it, or use it for other purposes than transactions, so it's primarily a currency, not money.

I have to add another comment: what worse scenario there is than do nothing and let BU take over?
The idea that a lot of fake UASF nodes could be spun up and then taken down to fork off Core nodes is in fact ludicrous: the presumption is that BU nodes would have more hashing power, otherwise this prank wouldn't work for them.
But if they have more hashing power they wouldn't need to play these silly games with UASF.

When I care about privacy I use cash, a cheap, proven and effortless way.
Yes, Bitcoin tx fee is fairly high, but 0.01 BTC is currently around $12 and can suffice for micropayments for different apps (e.g. I may need just $2-3 per month to donate to my few favorite blogs, in which case I'd pay 30 cents per hub per month (assuming it costs $1 to open/close a $12 micropayment channel, in BTC) to get better privacy in micropayments.

$1.2K is the rate for the semi-crappy platform that we have now. As the platform becomes less crappy, the price will grow. 
Even if one ignores everything else, the threat of State-imposed cashless totalitarianism is growing and has already become reality in places like India. 
Less than 10% of all "money" (inherently worthless paper, actually) can be withdrawn while 90% of it (your "savings") don't even exists, it's just an unfunded claim on worthless currencies. 
You can exit BTC, but what then? Cash is far worse and precious metals not a complete solution.

I'm saying you made those assumptions without elaborating why or referencing the sources of those assumptions, and then based on those you ask questions and ask commenters to elaborate why. Does that seem like a logical approach?
To your question, yes, I am saying if someone sends you BTC to the same address multiple times, they don't learn anything about you. Of course if they send you transactions periodically and you empty the address periodically, they would have more than 1 chance to find you but that's unrelated to the other party's reuse of your address. 
The whole thing about address reuse is explained and elaborated in many online articles, it just takes a google search to find them.

Two weekends ago I did a small test (sell my BTC at Bitfinex, buy a crapcoin, send it to another exchange, sell it for BTC) but because by then a lot of people were doing that the margin was already very thin and the wait (for withdrawal, transaction confirmations, etc.) and effort wasn't worth it.

They don't need to say much, they just need to signal. 
There may be others who would probably like to singal SegWit, but also plan to buy their stuff from Bitmain (whether it's with or without a built-in boost).
Because all these things (including the % of ASICBOOST-mined blocks, if any) is hard to estimate, it's not possible to make educated guesses, I think.

I also think it's more important what the users think, but we must stick to the basic principles - namely that all participation is voluntary and we cannot and should not argue that people ought to act against their own interests.
Some (by this I mean BU) miners are clearly acting against our (economic majority's) interests, but you can't claim they should work for "the greater good". 
We can only try to kick their ass. A UASF or even a change in PoW if necessary. IMO the BU miners are Wall St of bitcoin. Screw them.

They are welcome to try. If they want to use that money to fight they may "win", but they I'll still lose the money.

@_date: 2017-04-15 12:58:25


I don't think it will. 
Let's say you have 100 tx per month and 95 are shit transactions that can be done with SegWit. If you have 5 hubs (say Starbucks and whatnot) you need to do 5 (large) transactions on the main blockchain and 10 opens/closes with the hubs, so 15 vs. formerly 100. 
zCash: I get it, but I don't care to be "exposed" for buying coffee and such. I understand for some spending people may be more sensitive and for people who make thousands of transactions with many counterparties and different SegWit hubs, SegWit won't be a good solution. 
But the bottom line is transaction fees have to replace mining rewards if we're to keep the same or similar security of the network.

If you want to convert one currency (a fiat, say the euro) into another that *also* has no objective value independent of the observer, you may as well stay put or buy a bunch of random coins.

Another nonsense anti-gold post.
And what's the purpose of these comparisons with gold anyway? 
Most people who own bitcoin simply aren't interested in gold and hence don't compare bitcoin with gold, but with other cryptocurencies or fiat. In light of that even if the info provided was correct (which it wasn't), it would still be useless.
Personally I believe a much more desirable attitude is to educate younger generations about similarities between precious metals and bitcoin so that they learn how to avoid fiat whenever possible (for example if you want to have more of one and less of the other, sell gold and buy bitcoin).

There are privately owned tunnels (underground roads, basically) that work fine as well and cost the taxpayer *nothing*. I used one recently.

This doesn't mess with anything.
Somebody wants to transact. If you want to transact before them, pay more. 
Commoditification (do you mean free market?) is beautiful. If you need to transact, you can pay up and nothing can stop you because the greedy miners will take care of your transaction. If you don't want to transact and are just a troll (like the entity that spammed the network), you will lose out.

1. It's already known: Core doesn't have a stance.
2. Regardless of what Core thinks, UASF is a good choice because it can't happen without majority support for SegWit.
@_date: 2017-04-20 01:53:55
Yeah but it's not easy to define "clearly in favor". as someone mentioned BU could organize fake support. 
Personally I'm for UASF at 50 percent. Maybe 35% is also OK, but if we can't get to 50% WTF are we doing?
@_date: 2017-04-28 13:05:43

Smaller hubs are surely going to be less secure, but also contain fairly trivial amounts of BTC. I'd rather have 0.01 locked in each of 20 small hubs I use than 2 BTC in one megahub. The worst adversary these days is the State. Guess who they're going to attack first.
Privacy is important and I don't disagree with your points about it, but marginal cost (in say, time or behavior patterns) of implementing strict privacy makes it impractical to implement military grade data security to all your activities. If you do that, you can't do much else in your life, such as earn income (unless military grade security happens to be one of services you sell to others). 
Ultimately there have to be tradeoffs. I don't need to outrun the State - I just need to outrun 90% of the sheeple.

I have been thinking about this since I first heard about BTC and I think bitcoin is a great currency, but it can't exist without a constant expenditure of energy. In that way it is much more real than fiat (which alllows fiat miners to cheat), but still not on par with commodity based money.

I disagree. 
They drive the price down and they make less money even if they increase their share. 
And on top of that the talk of PoW algo modification would become very loud if they increased the market share, so it would create a lot of additional risk (as in, all their investment could turn into a worthless pile of hardware).
Separately, karlrais talks about "the best block size". I don't believe the best block size exists and that anyone knows what it is. In all likelihood it's best to simply endorse SegWit (and effectively increase block size), put this drama behind us and once SegWit effects are better understood, start looking into other options and define requirements for the next change.

Second, it doesn't feel similar to MtGox. There have been no indications that Bitfinnex is insolvent. 
Third, prior to MtGox going out of business they suspended cryptocurrency withdrawals. These guys haven't. (Additionally there was a comment to one of those redundant posts like yours which said that CHF and other withdrawals are working fine).

You assume the hash rate majority has nothing else to do but to attack a smaller chain. 
Now they are mining and not attacking alt coins. Some may agree with the idea that "somebody" should attack Core but it's like OPEC cartel - who wants to redirect their own resources away from money making?
After a fork their hardware would become almost worthless. I think it would be a miracle if they financially survived a fork, let alone had the resources to attack another chain. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 04:47:51
First, install Bitcoin Core and make it work on testnet (i.e. with fake bitcoin for testing), then play with it for a few weeks.
Once you're OK with that, buy a hardware wallet and use it on testnet. Try to delete your wallet on computer and try to recover it with your hardware wallet.
Third, use spare time (just google it, don't ask here) to read about various wallets which support h/w wallet integration and try out three you like the most. Send testnet BTC among all of them.
Then buy some real bitcoins and convert your Bitcoin Core to mainnet (you'll need 100+ GB of disk space) and transfer a small (0.001) amount of BTC from an exchange to this wallet. Repeat the above drills (from testnet).
Also transfer a small amount to each of 3 non-Bitcoin Core wallets you like the most and try to use them to send BTC among these 4 wallets. At that point you'll know what's best for you.
Asking questions without ever having used any of that stuff is pointless. You won't learn anything that way.

The scenario you imagine assumes "they" is a person, and not hundreds of people with their own interests.
I am sure some agree it'd be a great idea as long as they didn't have to pay for that.
Why would a mining rig owner give up on his income and dedicate his equipment to the worst risk outcome? 
Fake UASF nodes: a possibility but you have to assume mining pool members would stick with BU as BTC crashes to 900, 800, 700... in minutes and hours following the chain split.
For me the worst case is BU wins. That makes it very simple to decide what I'm going to do - run a full UASF SW node till this is over.

What does the price of bitcoin change? Nothing. 
Whether it's $100 or $10,000, nothing changes.
Satoshi didn't create Bitcoin so that its price can go up. Bitcoin works equally well at any price, including $1 (although it'd be harder to transact with it, for example you couldn't send $21 million in one transaction).

Coins can be recycled, so they're always worth the material they're made of (minus the expenses requried to recycle them).
I don't care about other crypto currencies but as far as BTC is concerned, its long-term economics are uncertain. At this time very few people buy it because they want to use it, so at some point tx fees will *might* become extremely expensive or not enough to sustain the cost of mining. Either of these cases can endager Bitcoin.

If something (let's say acquiring Bitcoin) gives one high marginal utility, it makes sense to reallocate resources from some other activities. But it doesn't make sense to completely cease other activities, which is why it makes perfect sense to not case other activities. 
So the OP (and your comment) is economic nonsense. If smoking doesn't give him any utility, why is he smoking (regardless of whether he wants to buy Bitcoin or not)? 
So "completely" was a qualifier related to marginal utility, but it seems some commenters need extra help to understand...

1) because BTC is in a bubble (maybe early stage, but a bubble nevertheless)

Not unreasonable, but I'd like us to wait shorter than you.
If users go to BTC with a new PoW, that will be the BTC. I am not so worried about that. From an "investment protection" perspective, you'd still hold your BTC on any and all chains. 
In my mind "governance protection" is a higher priority than "investment protection".

But if I'm not mistaken some Core devs have proposed a PoW change as emergency fix for take-over. So at least some of them think only a matter of deciding what/when is emergency (for example, one proposal was "no new blocks for X blocks"), not whether a HF PoW change is a good choice.

I mean Bitmain has been subsidizing and funding Bitcoin forks. Also they sell their miners for forked coins - clearly hostile, IMO; while they have the right to do that, we don't have to do business with an abusive supplier of PoW equipment.

That is so hilarious, thank you :-) 
Statist environmentals vehemently deny the argument that outputs (such as standard of living or amount of goods produced or security of a cryptocurrency) directly depend on inputs (such as energy), but apply the same ECON 101 principle in their own "fight". If they employed less energy, they'd be very ineffective at what they do (spread awareness, or whatever) so most environmentalists simply "have to" pollute more than their fellow citizens. And to you point, I think they are proud of that - their ability to live large is a result of their unique value: if we're to save energy and lower CO2 emissions on a large scale, we need to choose few leaders and make sure they use whatever resources it takes.

I can transfer a token that entitles the recipient to a fixed quantity of fully allocated gold stored in a warehouse (as opposed to financial institution). 
While (in theory) a warehouse can go bust (for example, they didn't pay rent), I wouldn't consider such a token to be an IOU. The warehouse doesn't have any significant debt and gold is fully allocated.

1) It's a soft fork, not a hard fork. ETC was a hard fork. 
2) It's the users' choice. If users think it's worth their while to use a chain, they'll use it. We don't need to worry what's better for the price of Bitcoin. It's about what's best for the users, not about making it easier for "investors" to get rich.
The miners can easily prevent this soft fork, they just need to start signaling for SegWit (which is what the (so far fake) New York Scaling agreement already promised to do -

Start here to get an idea what it means to users who plan to send/receive in early August: 
If you don't send/receive every day, you can just sit it out as far as your own wallet is concerned.
This is what BIP148 is about:
It's up to you if you want to help or participate. 
Assuming you've read the first post above, you may want to prepare and setup your home node. To do that, deploy a Bitcoin Core SegWit UASF BIP148 node - just google for `BIP148 UASF download` and get it from the Github.com repository (click on Releases tab). It works exactly as regular Bitcoin Core so you can read standard tutorials and how-to's to set it up.
But in days prior to August 1st you need to think how you want to trade the soft-fork or simply use your BIP148 coins (as you'll have "twice" as many as long as the two chains exist). 
 is a longer guide about all things UASF.

SPV wallets: yes I am aware of those. Many do not offer sufficient privacy and performance. For example if I use SVP wallet, doing it over Tor doesn't make sense (too slow or maybe even impossible). If I don't use Tor, I'm instantly identifiable to both the government and the servers' operators. 
Ultimately more and more users will need to run those but the smaller the number of "independent" full nodes, the more centralized Bitcoin is. 
Are you *not* upset about mining centralization? If not, how can you not be?
The richer Layer 2 and other solutions the better (cheaper, more anonymous, more decentralized).

There will likely be others. Bittylicious now has an obvious advantage over his competitors with roughly similar features - anyone who wants to use BIP148 coins now has one choice. Maybe that's 5% of all users, maybe 10%, maybe more. They'll win new customers.
An important point: businesses may want stability, but users may dislike holding a Jihan Coin. If the users leave, what are the businesses going to do? 
That's the premise anyway. If BIP148 doesn't attract enough users, it shouldn't succeed.

He clearly meant UASF BIP148 based on Core v0.14.1.
If BIP148 option is added to Bitcoin Core, there will be over 2K "real" BIP148 nodes by Aug 1. Not that the number matters, but some of those nodes will send/receive on Aug 1 so it will make sense to mine that chain.

If you use the BIP148 coin, you take economic activity to the BIP148 chain and the miners will follow. 
You can't use it if no one is accepting it, so the fact that you use it means there's someone out there who gives it some value. 
At least some exchanges will support BIP148 and those who don't will lose customers. 
By the way did you know that the longer UASF BIP148 holds out, the longer you can't safely use "legacy" Bitcoin on your exchange that doesn't support BIP148? 
If the BIP148 chain remains viable for weeks, you won't be able to safely use your BTC for weeks.

You lost nothing. If it never confirmed, it never left the wallet and I can't come *back*. 
It's a pending transaction at the moment and if it doesn't get confirmed within days it will never be recorded because it will have never happened.

If you don't have a bitcoin server (Bitcoin Core), then Electrum can't get any info from the blockchain or send shit to the network.

If I am unhappy with my ISP, I fight the government, not ISPs. But each to his own.
I don't know how Net Neutrality (or lack of it) works in your patch. I know that in some other places it's simply a way for people to ask for subsidies. In one market I know of the SP won't let you egress more than 5 GB/mo, regardless of what you do (seed legal amateur porn or run a full public Bitcoin Core node). If you want to do more than 5GB/mo you need to upgrade to a non-residential package and they'll happily let you send and receive more bytes.
I've never heard that SP's plan to block any particular cryptocurrency - why would they care as long as you pay? And why would they block Bitcoin and not everything else?

The basic idea is correct.
A miner could buy a crapload of BIP148 BTC (Bitfinex, for example) contracts (maybe use some savings rather thank take out a loan) and on Aug 1 join a UASF Pool.
BIP148 will be very cheap at the beginning because of the overwhelming hash power owned by the obstructionist miners.
Miners willing to switch can make extra profits as they can buy before others, but they shouldn't buy unless they have information that enough of their peers will do the same (i.e. there is a critical mass, maybe 25% of the hash power).
They need to find a way to buy not too early (they need to know that some of their peers will buy as well) and not too late (after the news is public or the price jumps a lot).

I disagree that it received any significant support. Roger Ver said he didn't sign it and he also negated that he agreed on SegWit now and 2MB later, and some other participants said they didn't sign as well. 
Most companies from the agreement are proxies of Jihan, Roger and DCG (the company that is investor in 27 of 56 entities mentioned on the agreement). 
And even among those listed there's no agreement as to what the "agreement" means.
In other words, it was a complete disaster. 
Tell us - does the agreement mean SegWit should be signaled now (as in, immediately this week)? Or something else (what?).

They may be a little less reluctant when they begin to lose customers and their business. Come August 1 UASF Bitcoiners won't be able to access their coins parked on exchanges that don't support BIP148 BTC (under whatever name). 
If you support UASF and want to have access (or simply trade) on and after August 1, what do you do? You take your business elsewhere. Not when they decide which side wins, but before, in July or earlier.

The whole point of UASF BIP148 is because nothing has materialized for so many months and FrankenSegwit won't allow SegWit without locking in a hard-fork which would be quite suicidal for users to accept.
Just looked at the tweet. 
1) What does "materialize" mean? 
The fake NY agreement already "materialized" and there's no "immediate" SW signaling despite that being the first bullet in their to-do list. 
2) **By when**?
UASF BIP148 is scheduled for August 1st.  Now if FrankenSegWit code isn't done and tested by August 1st, there's no point is waiting further. 
If it is (highly unlikely), then we can have SegWit before that.
So a reasonable statement - in my subjective view - would be to say "We'll support SegWit on or before August 1".
If the DCG gang or the miners were serious about "immediately", let's see it in action before August 1st. The miners or Jihan himself can do a MASF BIP148 as well. 
If Erik thinks "immediately" means "we're not sure", I'm sorry but that's not good enough. State your support for BIP148 now or wait for your competitors to do the right thing.

I was just thinking about that (probably while you were typing the comment :-)). 
These days governments are so pathetically bad at "creating [unsustainable] jobs" that these days it probably takes around $1 million to "create" a job. 
Bitcoin on the other hand creates real jobs and for free (in terms of public spending required for each such job), which is what they tend to like as long as it doesn't get too crazy and threaten to destroy their and their rentieer friends' jobs. 
But if bitcoin *continues to deliver* on its promise it will eventually threaten the fiat system.

LocalBitcoins is one, as linked above.
But if you have those issues maybe you should split purchases between previous metals (80%) and Bitcoin and do it on schedule to offline wallet, rather than go crazy with trading.
If you buy on LB you'll then be able to trade from home (Bitcoin for alts) and you can see where it goes from there. Not to mention online Bitcoin gambling from home. If I were you I would only buy physical precious metals because you know what will happen if you get your hands on crypto that you can use from home.

As long as there's money to be made (or stolen), people will flock into coins... Not just BTC but any. The rest from Top 10 have their fair share of scandals.
Mandatory voting exists to protect the consensus - nothing can change unless a large majority says "Yes". So if we get drunk on Saturday night and miss the Sunday elections, we'll still be fine unless there's overwhelming support that we couldn't override even if we voted "No". 
Also note that in Bitcoin it is miners, not users, who vote on important stuff. There's a lot of arguments what Satoshi meant (1 node 1 vote, or 1 miner 1 vote). Now it's 1 miner 1 vote (or rather 1 % of the hash power 1% of vote) and UASF is a departure from that principle. 
You'll probably never vote on any BIP except BIP148 because that is a user-activated BIP. That's why many UASF supporters see UASF BIP148 as the last chance to prevent Bitcoin from becoming a crypto-oligarchy with 1 Squid to Rule Them All (that squid is Bitmain &amp; their mining cabal).
To your voting point, every vote can be swayed with something. I think in the society the key is to allow citizens to not be impacted by whatever vote is passed. The very basic consensus (right to property, life) is the only thing needed. Because with that no matter which method is used and even whether the voters (or miners) are bought or not, it doesn't impact anyone who doesn't give a damn - no new law or rule can destroy the basic consensus and everything else is optional.

I know confirmation time will be much slower, but I only said it will be cheaper. 
Now if you pay a tx fee that used to be OK few months ago, you look into waiting 1-2 days. I expect that with on the BIP148 chain the same nominal fee will be much more effective but the advantage will be partially nullified by the slower speed.


Noone has to use SW transactions. If you want to send/receive on the main chain, you'll still be able to.
Even 8MB blocks can't accommodate as many transactions as we want, so I want both larger blocks and SW. 
SW is well tested and ready, but larger (non-SW) blocks in my opinion are not yet. 
I'd like to see 2MB blocks developed as soon as possible but see no reason to block SW or shoot for 8MB right away.

I'm bullish on Bitcoin only because I believe UASF BIP148 fork will succeed. Most "trader types" either don't know or don't care much about what's going on with Bitcoin. I don't care much what's going on with the price. IMO if BIP148 fails, Bitcoin will continue to lose importance.

That's the first argument from the BU attack template. I hear it every day. I said it's BU propaganda because it is. Did you come up with that "argument" on you own? No, because if you read any UASF BIP148 pages you would have learned that the number of nodes is irrelevant.

Just ignore him. He missed the point that it's $32 million, not 32,000 (or whatever the fuck M is supposed to stand for) BTC.
As an aside it's *impossible* to be 32,000,000 BTC short (or long) - another reason why his comment is nonsense.
And finally BTC *is* an asset that's impossible to counterfeit and that can be used as a currency. That's why it's price is rising.

But that's not how the Bitmain Cabal wants to do it. 
They want to lock-in HF to have it piggyback on a SW soft-fork.
If your argument were true, then the Bitmain Cabal would be against SW, or - as a compromise - in favor of SW followed by a separate discussion and development of 2MB HF.


UASF can't win unless it wins based on whether majority of users **and** miners support it, so why does UASF bother anyone?
Jihan's Cabal recently (allegedly) signed the NY Scaling Agreement where they said they'll start immediately signaling SW support. Where are we with that now?

Read what you just wrote. That's why. 
Don't blow your **entire** inheritance on Bitcoin just because you read about it (probably from sources you shouldn't trust).
Take your time to better understand Bitcoin. Anyway now the bubble is bursting so you won't miss out on anything.
Spread your risk.  It's crazy to sink everything into one thesis.
And it's always good to have some cash for emergencies and other stuff. 
I don't know your complete situation and I won't pretend I can give you good advice, but whatever you do, do it gradually. If you want to buy Bitcoins, buy $100/month and learn about Bitcoin as you go. 
You could probably use a small part to start some business. 
Even if you invest absolutely nothing, you'll still have that cash. Unless you see signs of hyperinflation, there's no reason to rush.

Or is there some other way of negotiating that I am not familiar with?

There's no agreement, or rather, it was a fake agreement to confuse the users, buy time and delay UASF BIP148.

That's why expertise in chip design and respect in the community are minimum (but not sufficient) req's for this type of org, as you pointed out earlier.
The best approach I can think of (right now) is a tightly run, altruistic non-profit.

I hear ya. I've been feeling like that until last week when I realized that the interest in UASF has picked up.
It won't be long before they accept the inevitable. My own thinking at this point is a) evangelize UASF and help people get on board, and b) because we have the upper hand and now they get it, give the "soft liners" in the opposing camp a chance to win over the obstructionists. 
As someone in  said, things are going well - right now we just need more UASF nodes and economy and miners will come on board.

Luke told you: nothing prevents you or any other exchange, wallet or user from using mBTC or whatever they want.
The built-in denomination of BTC *cannot* change.


It can be broken down, but the units of account cannot change. 1 BTC will always be 1 BTC and 1 satoshi will always be 1 satoshi. Whether you express amounts in BTC or Satoshis or whatever, it's your own choice. This isn't anything the "community" cares about or can change.

Not in the near term.
The throughput needs to go up. Some people want larger blocks, others want to provide a way to move low value transactions off the blockchain and settle them on the blockchain.
The two groups have been arguing about this for months (years?).
A group of users has created a patch that aims to influence the miners to support the latter approach. Google `uasf bip148` if interested in supporting this effort.

I also bought my first BTC at sub-$100 as well but I've bought and sold since then. 
The UASF BIP148 movement doesn't work based on the number of nodes - come Aug 1 you must have real users to send/receive coins in order for the miners to follow. Just the other day someone brought up 4,000+ new BIP148 nodes at Amazon (clearly, fake ones) to cause confusion. I know there were accusations that Bitcoin Unlimited had fake nodes too; I haven't spent time to check. 
Your concerns are understandable.

I don't have everything in BTC - I have "enough", so to speak.
"Enough" isn't a fixed amount - it's a changing amount based on expected needs and requirements and the macro situation (if banks start looking shaky again, I'd probably buy some more BTC).

Usually you need to wait up to a week. Worst case may be several weeks, but google it - it seems 90% of tx fail within 5-6 days.

You can't buy BIP148 BTC now because they'll appear on Aug 1.
Of course I've no clue what the probability is, but I don't want to use Bitmain Coin, so I'll bet on UASF anyway and not own any significant amount BTC if UASF doesn't prevail.

I believe Core members aren't obliged to support users-led initiatives as long as they don't purport to represent Core. If that wasn't the case most wouldn't be willing to be core contributors.
If Core as a whole was helpful we'd be discussing merits of various 2MB proposals because SegWit would be live on mainnet. 
Instead they're now discussing BIP149.

For marketing purposes, you can install the binary (or build from the source if you feel like) and let it work (possibly with `prune=550` if you disk is crap). 
A bit better and more advanced marketing move is to open a port on your firewall and direct it to $NODE:8333 so that the world can see your node.
That's about it until Aug 1st.
After Aug 1, you could broadcast Tresor-signed transactions from that node if you wanted to be on the SW/UASF network (if there are multiple networks, see Luke-Jr's post on dealing with those situations so that I don't repeat that well written article). 
Also if you wanted to receive coins on that network, you'd probably have to make sure the sender is on the same network. 
I strongly recommend Luke's article as it contains valuable info on what to do if things get messy. And (unfortunately) you'd probably have to come back to this subreddit or UASF-related sites to see if anything changes prior to Aug 1 because we don't yet know what The Agreement means and contains.

In the posts, yes. But I am pretty certain that 90% of visitors here do not read UASF-related posts. 
The "community" consists of people like us who read UASF-related posts, and of people who have a stake in the price going up until they exit the trade or startup or ICO. 
It's time to go for UASF BIP148 to find out whether the original Bitcoin can survive on the BIP148 chain.

I saw you said that before and didn't challenge this statement at all. 
By now there's enough support for BIP148 to justify this change (default: OFF) to relieve the users from having to find the UASF BIP148 binaries (which can't even be linked from here because they violate the subreddit's policies) and wonder whether they need to upgrade or change things again later.

I'm saying that *if* the theory of scarce supply applies here, we could stop hoarding right now (say, if each of us had 0.5 BTC) and spend the rest on other eggs placed in other baskets. 
But if the scarcity guys are incorrect, this may be incorrect too. For example, what if there's a huge shortage of cash in your country? If you had more of your savings in Bitcoin you could make a nice profit through arbitrage (maybe sell Bitcoin for gold). 
I use only BTC as store of value, because I believe that in absence of physical scarcity that gold and silver have, what matters most with cryptocurrencies is governance (which is why I support UASF BIP148) and technology. There are many different features and characteristics, but I think most aren't worth analyzing (and similar to company shares, 99% of buyers aren't capable of analysis even if they had complete data, which they don't). 
Note to myself: I'll have to read

I'd say DNM is probably less than 10% of BTC volume now (maybe it was different in 2016 and before). Whether that's 10% of 8%, it's irrelevant. 
My earlier point about Monero: let's say I'm a seller who now uses Monero instead of Bitcoin. Do I keep my savings in Monero? Or do I park them in BTC? If I need to park $50K and want to be able to sell it easily in one trade, I will park them in BTC. 
So I still require $50K (or whatever) in BTC. Changes for me or for bitcoin demand are insignificant.

It's definitively not long term-sustainable (years), but if the price goes up 2% a week we can continue like this **for months** and hit "only" $3.5K/BTC. (If you told people the price of bitcoin would go up 2% a week for 3-4 months, many wouldn't think it's a crap return compared to alts, I think.)
I also think there will be a sizeable correction soon, but I don't dare to short this rally (including the stupid altcoins). I also don't dare to buy a lot now.

Expensive tx's are going up (now they seem less expensive, when 1 hour delay in sending your BTC to an exchange can cost you $100).

LOL - absolute nonsense!!!
In another comment I wrote 5 mins ago I mentioned how these BU clowns simply refuse to learn:
And this BU shill/slave in specific - I already explained this to him in several posts, but he keeps coming back. 
UASF BIP148 by design **REFUSES** to accept blocks from "Chinese miners" (as if all Bitcoin miners in China have a hive mind). 
So you must be a total idiot to think that UASF chain will suffer because of that. **Even if the Bitmain cabal wanted to process transactions for the UASF chain, they could not do it. Their blocks will be discarded, yo!**
UASF BIP148 is an economic **boycott** of the Bitmain cabal. More here:


Anyone who's not a Bitmain slave will consider what's in their own business interest, and that includes farms inside China.
If Bitmain's slaves don't manage to escape from Jihan's plantation, others will come as long as there are transactions to be mined on the BIP148 chain.
Learn some economics, BU bozos! 
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:56:06
Yes, you should deploy a Bitcoin Core with SegWit UASF BIP148 patch - just google for `Bitcoin BIP148 UASF download` and get it from the Github.com repository (click on Releases tab).
Just install the s/w and configure it according to normal Bitcoin Core instructions. There are no UASF BIP148 specific instructions. 
Then you just run it. If you don't have 150 GB of free disk space, search on how to modify `bitcoin.conf` settings and add `prune=550` in the file, then restart.
On August 1st, the blockchain will split and you'll end up having your BTC on both the "legacy" and UASF BIP148 chain; so you'll need to mind how you act from that point on[1]. 
What matters is that you use this client to perform actual transactions - passively running UASF BIP148 node without any transactions won't help after August 1. 
The chain (side) which is more active in terms of transactions will most likely win.
Please do your own research regarding wallet operations after August 1st, but this applies whether you use UASF BIP148 or not.

Luke-Jr: thank you for being our voice.
This comment (not by Luke) sums it up: "but pretending to be neutral and not allowing an optional switch for bip148 seems disingenuous"
That's exactly what this is. Proposed -bip148 (corrected from 149) option is OFF by default and Core don't want to allow it, because it might put users who WANT to enable it, at risk.
This reminds me of recent government soda tax initiatives. Core is calories-neutral so you can drink anything you want as long as it's water.

They're layer 2 but opens/closes and settles are all recorded on the blockchain. 
I think you can open (say, you run Bitcoin Core wallet) channels from your own node. I haven't tried to use LN so I don't know but I did try to use some similar s/w and the channel is opened and closed on my full node and that's where I held my wallet too (the last part maybe not prudent on mainnet but I was testing)
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:29:55
Yes, I mean that's the nice thing about it. 
UASF people can keep their BIP148 and don't need to form an opinion on this Omnibus proposal as far as SegWit and UASF are concerned. (They can withhold their opinion on whether or not they agree with the 2MB HW - that can be subject to other discussions after SW takes effect).

If you keep them untouched during the split (if the chains split on Aug 1), they'll be fine.
But you wouldn't be able to 100% securely transfer or receive during that time because you won't have access to the both chains.
You should move to another wallet, for example Electrum, Samourai, Mycelium. All these are likely to support the both chains so you wouldn't be stuck.
With Electrum, for example, you can connect to both "legacy" and BIP148 servers, so if you split coins and have the same amount on each chain (during the split) and do whatever you want with them.

That's right. It seems 80% of posts here are about "going to the moon" while on r/BTC it's about how evil people are. 
But don't underestimate the effect of Bitcoin of those who quietly go about their business using Bitcoin. Just consider how many people have found happiness, jobs (and riches) in cryptocurrencies.

For me personally a $1+ tx fee is fine because I don't use bitcoin for small transfers.
I didn't mention my own acceptable transaction fee level because I don't want to imply the same fee ought to be suitable for others. 
Some folks want to be able to buy coffee with bitcoin by transacting on the *main* chain *and* pay a fee close to one charged by a centralized fiat payment processor who runs their service on 50 $20/mo VMs (smaller e-payment providers can be that small).

I don't see it that way. Weak hands barely bought their first BTC and many (especially in Asia) are not yet aware they're deep underwater. Weak hands will start selling next week.
Who is selling, then? Big traders who helped create (and destroy) this bubble and this likely includes parts of Bitmain miners' cabal. Weak hands don't *own* 100 BTC and don't make &gt; 100 BTC transactions, so it's not them. 
The supply situation hasn't significantly changed vs. yesterday or vs. last week or last year. Maybe it was priced in last year at $250 or whatever.
The price is unimportant and it'd be great if the price collapsed to below $1K so that we can go back to basics for a while.

Theoretically there is. See, I'm not saying you won't want to transact on that chain - Bitmain has purchased/invested in enough companies to get a decent amount of traffic for his legacy chain - but rather that all those who do have a choice will want to use the BIP148 chain. And as the miners follow, your chain ... disappears. 
Bitmain can waste more money and energy on fighting the users, but they can't win because if they win, they will have lost. 
Aug 7: Jihan celebrating the destruction of his customers' chain by tweeting religious massacre pictures. That will do wonders. 


I just asked questions, didn't offer answers, so that's not true.
I explained how I see it. I say I believe UASF can win, but at this moment our chances are still small. 
But two weeks ago I noticed the momentum and enthusiasm was shifting and now we have major wallets and community endorsements and 60 days to go. By then our chances should be quite decent. 


I think they will be cheap because the BIP148 chain should start empty. Maybe the miners won't be many, but there will be *some*.
It'd take a lot of transactions to make the blocks full (and that would be a great problem to have), and until that happens, transaction fees will be lower, I think. I do expect transactions will take longer, but they already take long as-is.


They'll have to rename the new coin and leave, which is not what I want to see (I'd rather like them to get over it and start working on development and testing for 2MB max block size). In that case you would be correct because there would be nothing going on on that chain (users would have to install different software, buy the coin, etc.) for days.

I understand the need for prudence and risk management, but as Kekcoin notes above, now - to continue with your example - it seems now this toy factory owner is under competitive pressure and instead of managing risk of using low quality materials, he outsources a new cost-down toy to a shady factory from East Asia. The risk is still there, but harder to manage. 
Maybe the new toy will meet safety requirements, but based this factory's track record there's no reason to be optimistic. While the locally made toy is already available, the guys in East Asia are just starting to make it and you won't even see a test sample - they'll ship directly to all Amazon warehouses worldwide.

Great PR for Bitcoin.

Serf: "Look there's a reliable, permissionless way to transfer value for a low cost. They call it Bitcoin"
Statist: "But it's also used by criminals and people who avoid taxation. Stay away and report any user to your local tax office"

The price in USD doesn't change any way you quote it.
Maybe you can create a proposal to quote the price not in USD but in $100 dollar notes? That makes the current price of BTC only 25.5. What's not to like?


The price should be intimidating because it's high and because it's up 10x compared to a year ago.

I don't exclude that possibility - we've seen this with various shitcoins that continue to grow no matter how shitty they are, because fit has set such low standards and expectations. I plan to stick around (in the Bitcoin community) only if BIP148 succeeds, though. 
If one is after money, it's been much easier to make it in shitcoins. If one is after properly done cryptocurrency, that too is now becoming easier in shitcoins. I didn't care about the former, but I can't not care about the both.

It wasn't "auto sent", it just remained lingering in some node out there and then successfully propagated to your wallet provider again, so it seems as if it was sent again. That's the old (original) transaction (you can tell by the transaction ID aka tx id and you can search those on sites like blockchain.info).
Note that you may not get consistent information on your yet-to-be confirmed transaction (problem described above) because different nodes may have different memory contents. Once the transaction gets several confirmations then it will be consistently seen from every place. If it fails to get any confirmations then it will "return", but let it "settle" and stay in wallet for 1-2 days to make sure it's not just temporary.
How long can this last? It could take 1-2 weeks. Don't make another payment unless you can get overpaid money back...

If Bitmain (let's name names) and their minions attacked and destroy the UASF chain, that would be their end.

I agree.  I don't know what number makes sense - maybe if we targeted 3,000 nodes by August that would help us influence large economic users for the final push.


I was thinking of a single repo with binaries where a BIP148 version would be replaced by a BIP149 version (if BIP148 doesn't succeed) so that users don't need to do anything but update their OS (which many do automatically). 
Edit: this wouldn't work for Windows users, so the idea isn't complete.

I run a BIP148 node to begin with and that's because I want to see Bitmain defeated. For me this is mandatory and the reason why I'm posting here when I have time.
I will also try to trade on this mess, not hoping to get rich, but to make a little bit of money. This is optional. If I be busy at work or something during those days, I'll completely miss this window of opportunity. 
If BitFinex makes BIP148 coins tradable, then it will be much easier to trade this without doing any of this complicated setups by yourself. They (BitFinex) said they'll make a solution for trading this split, but I don't have any details.
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:24:57
You should split your coins before transacting on the both networks. If you don't plan to transact until the dust settles, you don't need to.
See Luke's post: 
The UASF BIP148 Client is just Bitcoin Core with UASF BIP148 patch that declines blocks from non-SW signaling miners. There are no added or removed features compared to Bitcoin Core - it's just about 200 lines of code to ensure BIP148.
@_date: 2017-05-15 12:40:52
A group of us are selling so we can't tell you now. 
We'll post the reason later today.
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:47:22
I think it's the right decision if you have a non-trivial amount of coins.
A lot of wallets say that and it kind of makes sense, but when you think about it, they "recommend" to not do transactions. 
Does that mean you can do? And what happens if you do and they get reorg'ed? 
If you listen and not do transactions, then you essentially have a Wallet Holiday (planned downtime), which is also ridiculous.
Nobody is asking them to pick one side, but to add support for the other.

Fair enough. 
My own take is I'm "in" because I know what will happen with Bitcoin if everyone stays out and waits till it's safe and a sure bet.
Without a UASF, SegWit won't happen without a compromise. Any compromise now means next time there will be another, even greater, compromise and so on. It's bad enough as-is, and it's going to get worse without the users taking a stand now and every time it becomes necessary in the future.

I was saying that yes, there's a ton of BTC to be collected, but mining isn't a free activity. 
If (for example) there's 50 BTC in tx fees and it costs miners 40 BTC to process them, while there may be 30 BTC in 1,000 large transactions and that would cost 10 BTC to process them, they'll pick the latter and leave the former to float around until they have nothing more profitable to do.
They mine what makes them most money, not what seems to be the largest source of fees.

If the users switch, there's nothing you can do.
The NY deal isn't stupid for Bitmain: it does what it's supposed to do: it delays and does nothing meaningful. There's no copy of it with the attendees signatures and (if it was at all signed and the parties intend to uphold it) noone has started signaling SW support although the agreement says it's supposed to happen "immediately".

If you have direct access to wallet addresses and their private keys (I don't use BitPay, maybe you can check their FAQs) then you can access them from anywhere (or from home) using a wallet that supports the same BIP and the same set of words that can be used to unlock the wallet. For example if 2 wallets support BIP32 but they use different word sets, you won't be able to use one pass phrase to access another.
Install Bitcoin Core and try couple other wallets to learn more. The safest approach which also requires most responsibility and care, is to have your own setup at home.

As Peter Todd said it's unclear whether/how node diversity helps, but those who don't want to run Core, have a choice.
btcd is pretty decent, I've tried it on several occasions. But if you're an exchange or something like that, you may want to minimize, rather than increase, diversity in your infra.

In recent weeks I've (as it turns, incorrectly) sold more BTC than I should have. At least that seems to be the case currently. Previously - in other circumstances - I also sold too early (on way up) and/or bought too early (on way down). 
I think it's useless to analyze this madness from a fundamentals perspective. I wonder if the tulip mania felt like this. If it goes up, you need to buy more because it's going up.
Today I checked the fucking ETC - at one point it was 90% up (vs 24 hours ago). What *possible* new use case or circumstance has emerged since a day ago? None, except that it seems "undervalued"  now that most other tokens went up more than it.

If you searched this subreddit you'd have found the answers in less time it took you to write that post.
If you run your own Bitcoin node, you have a choice (such as, you can run Bitcoin Core SegWit UASF BIP148). 
If you use a wallet that doesn't offer your a choice, guess what - you don't have a choice! Your wallet contents may turn into worthless JihanCoin shitcoin on August 1.

My best guess - based on my own behavior - is that most upvotes come from a relatively low number (in proportion to total number of visitors) of hardcore UASF supporters.

UASF BIP148 will succeed or fail on its own merits. If the users move, the miners will move with them.

This would be of huge help so that we don't have to tell people to google for BIP148 binaries (as we aren't allowed to post download links to UASF BIP148 repo).

Yes. 
There's no PDF with signatures or digital signatures so that we can see who actually signed it, no deadlines and no software that can be deployed "immediately" and no new miner is signaling for SW although no software is required for that. 
If none of these essential details and actions are available, what have they actually agreed upon?  


I'm for bigger blocks as well. If I estimate that Core is deliberately and unreasonably delaying development of larger size blocks after SegWit "results are in" , I'll be part of the next UASF (for larger block sizes).

If SegWit doesn't kill covert ASICBOOST exploit, my feeling is that will be taken care of soon after this UASF is done.
With the higher price it is more likely new chip vendors will emerge. If Bitmain doesn't play along, they'll only make it more attractive for others to enter this space. The more new entrants the better.

A pruned node with BIP148 code counts as a message of support.

People usually park at at exchange because they trade. Sending in and out is expensive and with the congestion it's even unreliable and can be dangerous. 
For example, I'm a newbie who just bought and wants to sell (panic) in case of a significant correction. If I hold 1 BTC in my own wallet and a correction unfolds, it would likely take me hours to send that coin to Polo and sell it. It may turn out that the person who had it parked at the exchange gets out at $1,900, whereby I get out at $1,400. Unless I can *precisely compare the likelihoods* of Polo getting hacked and me losing my own wallet or private keys I can't say who would be better off - the guy who didn't do anything, or I who followed your advice.
Another case is I have about $300 worth of coins at an exchange. Why bother withdrawing them? It's simply not worth the trouble. If the exchange goes down, fuck it. I'm not going to create a cold wallet and mess around around with passwords and backups.
The basic premise of being your own bank is correct. 
But it doesn't apply to everyone.

Nothing, when the network is up. If your node is running you already can get a list of all nodes on the network.

Not only I won't spook but I will use that chance to buy some BIP148 BTC. :-)
Earlier today some joker told me I'm not a hodler if I support UASF. 
Any person who enters Aug 1 with "legacy" BTC will be able to hodl their legacy BTC **and** trade BIP148 BTC if they want to. Assuming they don't use a substandard exchange that doesn't have BIP148 BTC. Even if BIP148 BTC fails, those who used good exchanges will still have their legacy BTC.

There is at least one that I know of - you can find it on the UASF FAQs site which we can't even link to because it links to UASF BIP148 binaries which this subreddit doesn't allow linking to. 
I mention this (rather than give the name of the exchange) to illustrate this vicious circle: we can't get an "off-by-default" (or better) BIP148 (edit: correct typo) option into Bitcoin Core so we have to do 5 times the work to find users and deploy.
Then, because we're adding supporters slower than we could, many businesses and exchanges are waiting longer and everything takes more time, which is then used as the main arguments (not enough users, not enough time) why this won't work. 
But.... UASF BIP148 is not dead in the water. We're not turning our nodes off.

No one can tell for sure, we'll see when people vote with their BTC on August 1st.
It won't be like ETC because 
1. Bitcoin is less decentralized than Shitereum was when their Dear Leader decided to kick out ETC. 
2. No big pile of centrally controlled money that could be withheld from BIP148 BTC community. And the community doesn't even need any money to sustain itself (unlike the parasitic parties in the NYC agreement).
3. UASF BIP148 is a user-led soft-fork, not Dear Leader-led hard fork.
There's probably more but by now you should get the idea. 
I believe UASF BIP148 will prevail and the legacy Jihan Coin will die off or become a minor player that will seek its fortunes in government-led "blockchain" projects.

Damages (e.g. due to unplanned downtime) are easy to prove. The potential plaintiffs are many. 
Using unsupported OS is interesting. Maybe due care can be demonstrated if no known exploits of that service existed prior to the appearance of this malware. (Otherwise one could be potentially found guilty of negligence when running any service, supported or not).
It'd be strange if finding a vulnerability, *developing a tool to offensively exploit it* and then *losing control of it* could be considered due care, while running an outdated OS without known vulnerabilities on a LAN wouldn't. 
I don't claim the plaintiff would win, I just wish there was a lawsuit against the US government.

They can simply suspend service due to whatever reason they want, including new government "regulations". 
To protect citizens from the record volatility and future crashes, the central bank has decided to offer a more reliable  GovCoin. 


They don't need to offer their service to Tor exit relays or over Tor. 
Within a country, it's easy to find out who's connecting from where, when transactions are broadcast and what addresses are involved, so if you send BTC a handful of times and all Bitcoin servers are under their control they'd have to be very incompetent to be unable to find your address.

It seems no one wants to estimate how large this large percentage needs to be.
When there's no goal, people generally aren't motivated to work on making it happen.


Does that mean we'll all have to uninstall BIP148 if a UASF doesn't succeed?
In that case it wouldn't make much sense for a non-enthusiast to install a BIP148 version in that case, and consequently it doesn't make much sense for an enthusiast to promote BIP148 to non-enthusiasts. 
We could as well run with uacomment for BIP149 now and promote that until a BIP149 version of Bitcoin Core is available.

To me personally, at this point only UASF BIP148 is not the hype.
Bitcoin is gradually being taken over (in the sense of the ability to influence where it's going) by corrupt corporate types, miners and other bad actors. Users who wanted a decentralized currency free of corruption are losing out.
I've said it before if UASF BIP148 doesn't happen, I'm out Bitcoin. And I'll never post on this subreddit again. We'll see in August.

Your coins may or may not be safe, depending on what you do during the split.
 
Electrum - which is ready now - lets you use the both legacy BTC and BIP148 BTCP starting on August 1st. Mycelium will probably do the same.
All wallet and exchange providers should add support to BIP148 because without doing that they effectively make it impossible for their customers to access the coins on the BIP148 chain and as Luke mentioned above, expose them to various risks.
@_date: 2017-05-14 03:59:43
Listen up morons, this isn't communism so we don't need you to "build a case" for every Bitcoin user.
I know the statist in you may think we need a web site or the government to protect us, but in reality we are just fine. We use wallets that work the way we like it, and don't use those that don't. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:34:52
But your OP says liquidity, not demand. 
If DNM started using (they already have, by the way - some use Monero and so on) other currencies in addition to Bitcoin, I don't see why that would have any effect on the liquidity of BTC.
You also don't know and likely can't estimate how many of those who use Monero on DNM ultimately exit to Bitcoin - I'd say most, so even if other currencies are used for transacting, the impact on demand for BTC is very small.
The demand for bitcoin is by far outstripping the supply and it mostly occurs on Bitcoin exchanges. I don't think DNM play an important role these days.
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:44:03
I've no need for it! I occasionally use PayPal and it works well for me. I don't use it often enough to be bothered by the cost (I don't even know what it is, but it's probably higher than Ripple but why bother to save $5/year.) Yes, Ripple has **a** solution, but not for any of my needs.
Bitcoin, on the other hand... I don't need anyone's permission to buy or spend Bitcoin. This alone makes me comfortable with having savings parked in BTC even when I know I won't need it anytime soon. It's mine, I can buy with it whatever I want and I don't have to explain myself to anyone. Quite a value! And Bitcoin does it better than any other crypto currency.
Maybe some users, somewhere have a need for cheap and fast transfers of XRP or fiat or something like that. Where I live that problem has been solved - mobile phone apps and other technologies provide *free* P2P money transfer and *free* retail micropayments (and I still I don't use any of them). 
I don't seek speed, low cost or efficiency. There's too much of that. I seek freedom and independence. That's scarce.

The US dollar has no economy to back its value either. People use it because they have to.
An economy doesn't "require" shit. US dollar transactions aren't "free". People who use it help fund the largest terrorist organization ever known and owning the US dollar costs them about 2-3% per year (price inflation) while other costs (paper inflation that hasn't bubbled into goods' &amp; services' prices) are yet to be known.
Then there are tens of billions stolen by the Wall Street through various machinations and subsidies by the Federal Government. 
In Bitcoin, tx fees are a way to pay for a decentralized, free-market currency. 
And UASF gives us a chance to deal with misbehaving miners, which is inconceivable with any fiat currency.

But if you take weeks to hit that 6 block streak, the "legacy" BTC would have less than 50% of the pre-Aug hashing power, no?
Wouldn't that alone seal the fate of the legacy BTC chain? (Basically what cacheson said above).
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:46:15
That's the main reason. 
A problem is that the platform is stuck due to a long lasting disagreement about its future direction. Read about SegWit and 2MB issues. The community is split in 2 opposing factions and the problem won't be resolved without significant disturbances. 
It's a good opportunity (to trade during volatile times) but just like in this bubble, newbies get ripped off while the insiders profit so don't think you're more gifted than the average buyer (who loses money because the top 10% probably make 90% of trading profits).

I don't want to argue off topic here, but from my perspective I don't think the rest of you are changing the world for better, that's why I'm BIP148-ing.
Actually I don't understand who is "the rest of us" - the NY Scaling Agreement committed to signal for SW support immediately. That agreement was supported by 83% of the hash power, so here we have BIP148 supporters, there there are SW supporters and "the rest" should be a very tiny minority.
If BarryCoin actually gets implemented according to the agreement, BIP148 won't cause any trouble because SW will have been activated much sooner. Core wasn't part of BarryCoin so nothing stops the NY guys from executing their plan.

How to run a BIP-148 node locally - there are guides here for example: 
For BIP148 we don't need dedicated guides, I would say - the installation and setup are indistinguishable from Bitcoin Core. The only difference is that on Aug 1 it behaves differently (soft-forks) which is explained both here ( and at the link at the very bottom.
One-click installers (and in cloud at that) - I think this idea will be heavily downvoted ;-) 
List of companies - we have it on `http  uasf co` - I can't link to it because it also containers Bitcoin Core UASF BIP148 binaries which is against the subreddit rules.

BIP148 is SegWit, but without interference by malicious miners (basically, Bitmain's minions).
SegWit that the miners were supposed to signal for is semi-dead because of this obstruction. 
Bitmain's gang are now building their own client that will likely allow them to keep ASICBoost, implement a different SegWit signalling, lock-in a reckless 2MB block increase 6 months down the road and gradually extend their tentacles over Bitcoin Core (see

**UASF FENCE-SITTERS**: please check these shills' comments, this is awesome!!!


Did you read **any** of what was explained to you above???
The UASF chain will **boycott** all blocks from non-Segwit miners.
Starting at 00:00:00 on August 1st, approximately 70% of all Bitcoin miners will be **automatically banned** from processing transactions on the UASF BIP148 chain.
Most miners (all from Bitmain's cabal) will have to go out of their way to get the privilege to process UASF nodes' "spam transactions".
If they don't like the UASF chain's transactions, they don't have to do anything.

We have the *code* for SegWit, but it's not taking effect since last year because the 2/3 of the miners won't endorse it, and those that won't endorse it are holding it a hostage so that their 2MB change gets approved.

When this "debate" on SW and big blocks started (was it in 2015?), nobody insisted anything (actually I didn't even read about it, thinking I'll read when it's done).
Now there's barely anyone left to say anything. 
Bitmain makes $1 million in transaction fees per day, and can spend 5-10,000 / day on social engineering by paying 50 Sat Slaves like this clown here who created the OP.
This is it. If BIP148 doesn't win, next year you'll be running Bitmain-created binaries (they're "sponsoring" the "development" of 2MB code) or using a Bitmain-owned Web wallet.
An end-to-end solution: they mine it, they sell it on their exchanges, they send Web tx to their mining pools. Wonderful! I think they could even sell "1 block theft protection insurance" because they'll be able to track every transaction from the moment it happens in your client till it's confirmed... 
Worse than the fucking Fed!

1) You certainly can install none and just watch public explorers/stats
2) *If* you want to transact on one (or both!) of the chains, you need to have coins in the right wallet and accessible. Some (see uasf.co) exchanges and wallet provides will support the both, but you can also withdraw all your coins to a local wallet(s)
3) Yes, you can operate the both nodes at home, and spend on each side of the chain. How to go about that? Just install 2 VMs with two versions - Bitcoin Core and UASF BIP148 (which you can download via links at uasf.co).
You should send the coins to these way before August 1, just in case transactions don't get confirmed and you have to retry. 
If you just sit tight and wait it out, that's also an option (if you don't mind to see Bitcoin turn into a Jihan/Corporate Coin).

UASF BIP148 isn't a hard fork and doesn't have anything to do with the large block discussion. It simply boycotts all blocks from miners who don't signal SegWit on the UASF BIP148 chain (which will be soft-forked on Aug 1).
Source and binaries for Bitcoin Core UASF BIP148 have been available for weeks now (google `uasf bip148 github`). The difference vs. Bitcoin Core is just about 200 or so lines; I don't think any other changes are needed as it simply declines blocks from non-SW signaling miners.
Read more at uasfguide.com
The 2MB/4MB big block is an entirely different thing, promoted by Bitmain and BU people. That requires a hard fork and there are several proposals and no production-ready code. BIP148 enables production-ready SegWit code, that's all.

Yes there is a delay, but the *net* effect is the same if everyone buys and sells the same amount of BTC.
It's more likely that people who are buying (wherever they're buying) are accumulating. 
And by the way, this (fake) Bitfinex crisis has caused a similar spike in shitcoin prices on Bitfinex (vs. open market prices), but altcoins have been going up before and I think the net effect on them is also negligible.

I've always wondered how Bitcoin improves "inclusion". Do they give it away? I can see how it can work with a R3 or IBM shitcoin - it costs nothing to make and it can be created at will. The benefit (to the government) of giving it away is significantly higher than the cost.

A lot depends on what traders (not the "community") feel about this. If they think this news is tradeable for a while, they may be the ones buying today because a lot of sheeple will come on board tomorrow when the news appears in semi-mainstream media.
My probably wrong guess: BTC goes up for few more days on this news, corrects slightly, then goes up again after the media machine, funded by marketing money from projects and startups that can take advantage of SW, starts another hype offensive.
Personally I don't feel like buying because I'm disappointed by this development. But for those who want to play maybe it's still OK to add a little. I wouldn't go all-in though.
@_date: 2017-05-28 07:17:33
Ok, a hopefully simpler version is that you may care:
* If you think Bitmain (which directly or indirectly controls a lot of the miners) is responsible for the stagnation of innovation through the blocking of SegWit and related features
* If you think Bitmain is responsible for the rising transaction fees
* If you think Bitmain and their corporate buddies are gradually taking over Bitcoin and turning it into a shitcoin
Bitmain blames Bitcoin Core for the first two and denies the third. You need to do your own research.
UASF BIP148 is an attempt to force Bitmain &amp; crony capitalists to adopt SegWit and restore the most fundamental aspect of Bitcoin (decentralization). 
Its success depends on whether or not people will take their business (transactions) to a UASF soft-fork. If we do, the miners have to listen and SegWit gets adopted. Also later on, if they try to pull crappy tricks and delay we won't need to negotiate for years - we'll know we can UASF as necessary.
If you don't do anything, you become a passenger in Bitmain train to centralization. 
Some people are here just to trade, some are self-proclaimed long term holders (who don't realize there's no long term future for Bitcoin if Bitmain takes over), some are paid Bitmain shills, etc. 
Many (most?) of them don't care so they won't do anything (even advocate or evangelize); in fact some will anti-evangelize.
If this is too complicated you can still spread awareness from whatever perspective you like, because August 1 will also be a good opportunity for trading, as well as a risky day for those whose transactions get messed up on that day.

When it comes to manual sends, I'm kind of used to spending some extra effort to make sure I enter the right number. That seems like unnecessary extra work, but it rarely has to be done (for example when I play with bitcoin-cli). For example your wallet shows the price and if it doesn't look off by an order of magnitude, you just press OK. Or on the exchange, you don't have to actually enter 0.0003433 - you click on the highest ranked Bid or Ask and that does it.
App authors can to offer (many already do) the ability for the user to set his own preferred denomination and name for that denomination (if they don't like mBTC). 
It's OK for the advocates of a marketing friendly name for mBTC to seek support and ideas. 
I am against these denominations becoming the default in Bitcoin Core (which is what some mBTC people have been advocating).
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:41:13
It wasn't like that at all (as far as I can tell);  it was the big blockers trying to confuse and delay (again).
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:42:21
Firstly, Gox wasn't like that at all.
Secondly, Bitfinex isn't artificially pulling up the price. People buy BTC there and *can* sell it elsewhere if they choose so. 
a) If they did that, their actions wouldn't have any effect.
b) If they didn't sell their BTC acquired at a higher price, then it's simply new net demand. 
You're saying they don't sell their Bitfinex-acquired coins once they get them out (i.e. they cause the price to raise) which is the latter case.
More importantly, why the hell would Bitfinex halt trading? So that you feel better about the world?
@_date: 2017-05-07 06:31:57
Like I said after SegWit there will be metrics and observations that will make it easier to finalize one of those BIPs, then (anyone's guess) 6-9 months to implement it. 
If SegWit - which is uncontroversial, well understood, tested and now even implemented in some altcoins - was adopted last year, by now we'll be halfway done and by end of 2017 we'd have larger blocks. 
Instead of wondering why BU and others fuck with Bitcoin and how to stop them, you're asking about trivial details on which there's a fair amount of agreement and several existing proposals.

I've read it about it and although I'm not competent enough to judge its merits vs. this BIP's 2MB proposal, my point from a UASF/user perspective is: if I don't express my support for this BIP now, I can be against it later.
Of course in your position (if you have to ACK or nACK), that's not possible so I understand why you want to ACK something that's better than this.

IMO the situation is so bad that **any** outcome except a successful BIP148 soft fork will cause gradual decline of Bitcoin years to come. For me it's either BIP148 or nothing.

UASF BIP148 supports suggest that people who support UASF use a BIP148-compatible client/wallet and move their business there (see Luke's post for various scenarios).
Others - who don't care or just want to sit this out, for example - don't have to do anything.
Please see what Luke said:
Note that people who control their own wallet and have 2 ("legacy" and BIP148-compatible) clients/wallets with identical seed or addresses, will see their BTC "double" once the chains fork on August 1.
I wrote about this in several topics earlier today so I won't repeat, but here's one of these scenarios:

Screw compromises, they've had years to do that. 
*We don't need to use Bitcoin*. Bitcoin exists for the users, not for the miners.
If Bitcoin can't work the way it's supposed to, what's the point of compromising? You can create a new coin or pick any of the hundreds that work better for you. If BIP148 doesn't succeed, that's excactly what I'm going to do.

In my first comment I said I can download it once and use it from my local PC. If I trust it the first time and record or remember (or store elsewhere) first or last digits of its checksum, I don't have to trust that it hasn't been compromised as I can verify the checksum before I run it again. Or, if I have GnuPG I can sign the downloaded verified code and recheck that it hasn't been tampered with before I run.


In that case you trust IPFS (the code *and* the platform) every time you run it, whereas I trust my recorded checksum (or self-signed JS file) every time I run it.
I think IPFS is great, but I don't think it helps solve this particular problem.

As long as there's significant resistance from either Core or the miners, no UASF is safe from failing.

We should hope to have multiple useful ways to transact. Some have said LN will lead to centralization of payment processing hubs, so if Moonbeam or something like it makes it easier and cheaper to run small transaction processing for trusted customers, I'd gladly try it out.

The worst case scenario is I can't access my BTC at all, then secondly that I cannot do it without them and the government knowing I own BTC. And if I could access, they could track my transactions (unless there are some additional anonimization features implemented by then, but if there's no trusted development team, why would they ever develop such features).
Your SPV scenarios: I am aware of them, but none of them are good at this time. 
Compared to let's say Samourai + Bitcoin Core (non-pruned) + Tor. The convenience, speed, privacy, security, etc.

tl;dr: if you don't use your wallet on Aug 1 and until the soft-fork is resolved (could be days), do nothing.
If you do plan to buy/sell/send/receive during that time, then move the coins to an exchange that intends to support the both BTC ("legacy" and BIP148 BTC) because you'll be able to use your BTC on either (or both) chains.

A big blocker article that summarizes pros and cons.
It blames Core (not news, of course) for delays, but completely fails to mention the widely-ridiculed Big Blockers' fake agreement from NYC (which Core wasn't even invited to) that showcased the incompetence of Bitmain, Ver and their minions. 
It also misinterprets the "all users should be running full nodes" complaint. It's not all users should be running full nodes, but rather that almost any user with a decent connection and hardware system should be able to run a full node.
Oh well. If the article reflected on the failed NYC "agreement" which Core wasn't part of and can't be blamed for, I would read it more carefully.

Noone can answer who's popular among the supporters (and popular for what? trading? buying BTC for fiat? in which location? etc.). All who support UASF are equal as far as UASF is concerned. The list isn't a recommendation or advice to use any services.
To your second point, it's a "white list". If someone stated on the record "I'm in", then they can get listed. All others are probably not (there may come a moment when the list won't be updated - for example after Aug 1, or before if support becomes so overwhelming that we don't need to update the list).

a community of predatory traders help build the usual hype cycle (which includes, but isn't limited to, spamming this subreddit with positive news or memes aimed to create the fear of missing out) and offload BTC to newcomers.

a) Let's say a company listed under the symbol SHIT starts trading at $1 and one day ends up at $400. Now in order to buy 100 you need $40,000. So they split (say 20 to 1) and now it's $20. People who buy in blocks of 100 can buy SHIT again, now in purchase amounts of $2,000 or a multiple of that.
b) Let's say Bitcoin starts at $0 and ends up at $2,000. Now you set your exchange interface to display units in mBTC and you'll see $2 instead of $2,000.
I, on the other hand, don't give a shit about that and still see $2,000.
Problem solved.
What you want is to change the *name* so that Bitcoin tomorrow means what millibitcoin meant today. That is totally insane.

Secondly, there isn't much to "know" about gold: you buy it and later you buy some more. No need to search for it more than once in a long while. Whereas it could probably be argued that one makes more searches if she has more BTC (trade, buy hardware wallet, upgrade full node, check transaction rates, etc).

It appears Coinbase has been having service availability or performance issues since before yesterday's mini-crash. After yesterday's crash dozens of their customers posted comments like this[1]:
*Every time I've fucking wanted to mess around with my account during this shit it's down. This is what keeps me from investing into Bitcoin aggressively*
Shit happens, and not only to Coinbase.
While unplanned technical issues are inevitable and may coincide with turbulent market events and result in trading losses, planned issues or downtime can be mitigated.
Despite that many users choose to ignore the fact that they may be unable to access their wallet during Day 0 of UASF BIP148 (August 1, 2017) which could be one of *most volatile* trading days of this year.
What can you do to maintain access to your funds? You can ask your exchange or wallet provider to add support for UASF BIP148 BTC or withdraw funds prior to August 1 and keep them under your control. The latter option isn't realistic if you want to be able to continue to trade on a centralized exchange, so what you should do is ask your service provider to enable access to UASF BIP148 network by July. 
If they aren't willing to do that, you can move your funds to one of exchanges or wallets that support BIP148 (see 
User-activated Soft Fork with BIP148 takes effect on August 1st, 2017. If you keep your wallet with services that do not support UASF BIP148, you will not be able to access your funds on the BIP148 chain during that potentially highly volatile time. If you want to remain in control, migrate funds to a BIP148-ready exchange or to your own wallet.

Third, transactions on Ripple are cheaper but many people have zero need for it. I can get free online transactions where I live, and I get free transactions with cash as well. But if you want to send a significant amount of value to anyone in the world and want to be sure it will happen regardless of what other people think, there's only one reliable means of doing that and that is Bitcoin.

You should reply to my comment if you want to reply to my comment.
What I mean is this: let's say in early hours of August 1, your friend decides to use the BIP148 chain. He sends you some BTC. 
If you don't have access to that chain, you won't have access to those coins (because you'll be on the legacy chain). 
Eventually the chains will most likely merge (maybe hours, maybe days or weeks) so in your case you (say you don't touch your wallet till 2019) don't have to do anything, but when you do access your wallet if the surviving chain is "legacy" chain you'd never see the payment that was made on the BIP148 chain.
That's why those who will transact before the battle is settled should have access to both chains.
If you had access to the both chains right after the payment (example above), you could sell BIP148 BTC you received or buy something with them, and you could also sell BIP148 BTC balance you have on Tresor (because you'll get 1x of your wallet balance on the both chains during soft-fork).

It offers no practical value because (not especially) there's too few nodes running it. 
I hope it's because it's still too early and many what-if questions haven't been settled. 
Secondly there's been very little advocacy so far. This can be fixed if we invest more effort in outreach. 
Thirdly it appears significant economic users (such as exchanges or wallets) are in wait-and-see mode and won't act. 
I think we'll have to push harder and focus on BIP149 (or something better if it comes out by November) so that there's a single story. 
Right now a full node owner has to digest and understand too much information related to UASF and (due to the recent raise in BTC price) is more interested in trading than the future of the network. 
There has to be one story that's easy to understand (such as no more than 5 Q&amp;A's). That's not the case now. Maybe it won't ever be.

That's reasonable. If you check my comment history (or better not, I've  been posting like a madman), I provide this [1] link (or tell them to use search to find it) to all who ask about using UASF BIP148 node.


Some UASFers are just kicking tires, others are determined. 
There are opportunistic non-UASFers who may turn into UASFers (such as some Bitmain-associated pools).
I'm a nobody so I don't matter in all this, but for what it's worth I've said if UASF fails I'll give up on BTC and this subreddit.
For me BIP149 or some deal won't do. It's UASF BIP148 or I'm out.

If you search for that string you'll find OS X package of Bitcoin Core.
Just add `prune=550` to `bitcoin.conf` and it will take &lt; 600 MB. 
It doesn't have to be on all the time to count.
What is important that after August 1st, you vote with your money and transact on that chain. You can keep it off when you don't use it - the only effect is a lower node count which is not that important, it's merely apperance.
You can also transact on the other chain, of course, by (for example) leaving some BTC on an exchange that will support the legacy chain, and sending some to an address on your local nodes prior to August 1. 
Many of us will sell the legacy BTC and keep our BIP148 BTC. The link I posted above explains some risks and opportunities that will arise on August 1st.

It's not a number game. It's a transactions game.
The network should work for the users. If the users boycott Bitmain, they can provide services the users want, or mine their own shitcoin.




According to your expert opinion, **the users are supposed to serve the miners and the citizens are supposed to serve the government**.

Luke created a whole post on this, about risks for wallet providers.
They're putting you at risk by *not* providing you with BIP148. Come Aug 1, they'll be creating invalid transactions as far as UASF users are concerned. 
If they care about all their users, they presumably want all current customers to remain future customers. 
If they decide to support only BIP148 then some other customers would be screwed, but they need to decide whether they want to lose customers or not (they could support the both if they wanted to and keep all customers, so nobody would get screwed).  We believe UASF users will be many.

Yes, it is called a User-Activated Soft Fork and there's one coming up, UASF BIP148. We (the users) are trying to solve the obstruction issue by running a custom Bitcoin Core package which kicks in on August 1st 2017 (00:00:00 UTC). Then it refuses to accept any block that's not created by SegWit-signaling miners. 
That will temporarily create 2 chains (soft fork) and force users and miners to choose what they want to do. Many UASF BIP148 supporters will sell the legacy BTC and use their BIP148 BTC.
If we "lose out" then the legacy fork will win and we'll be faced with the same problem (and transactions on the BIP148 chain will be reverted). If we prevail, SegWit will take effect.
If you want to use BIP148 bitcoins after August 1st, you can deploy a Bitcoin Core SegWit UASF BIP148 node - just google for `BIP148 UASF download` and get it from the Github.com repository (click on Releases tab).
This Bitcoin Core (UASF BIP148) works the same as the official version (until August 1, when it forks). You would configure it according to normal Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 instructions. 
There are no UASF BIP148 specific instructions. 
If you don't have 150 GB of free disk space, search on how to modify `bitcoin.conf` settings and add `prune=550` in the file, then restart.
On August 1st, because the blockchain will split, you'd need to mind how you transact then. 
What matters is that you use this client to perform actual transactions - passively running a BIP148 node without any transactions won't help after August 1. 
The chain (side) which is more active will most likely win. 
On this subreddit you can find guides and articles on various scenarios and outcomes after August 1.
Search for `uasf bip148`.
To your last question: that would require a change in Proof of Work which requires a big, fundamental change in how Bitcoin works and it cannot happen without a lot more discussion followed by a *hard* fork. It's not impossible and even if it happens it may not please everyone. First we'll try nicely, with a soft-fork.

You're missing that the node count is *completely irrelevant*. All BU supporters heard that nonsense somewhere and keep asking us how we're going to succeed with just X% of the nodes. 
What is required is for the BIP148 chain to become a bigger chain in terms of real economic activity. The miners will follow. That's all.
I said it's free money for you if you think the chance that "legacy" chain will prevail is 100%. You can get 127% back if you invest 1 BTC. You need to include the cost of transactions, some risk that the site will disappear, but you still can make more than 20% or close to 3% per month.


None. I don't have any other plan but for UASF to succeed. If it doesn't, I will abandon Bitcoin.
Whatever the actual chances are, a successful BIP148 is the only condition that will make me continue using BTC.

10 years is too long a horizon for me. Just this year we have a UASF (BIP148) and a possible hard fork and the miners are (basically) already controlling Bitcoin. If BIP148 doesn't succeed, how can it possibly get better in the future?
Because of that my Bitcoin prediction horizon is now months (I continue to make wrong short-term predictions, of course, but I don't even try to make predictions for 2018).
Prior to Aug 1 I will make an investment in BIP148 BTC. That's the only purchase I plan to make.

Red (below) thinks this epic battle will last for weeks or months, but I think it's going to be settled in days. 
However you look at it, it makes sense to sell legacy BTC and keep BIP148 BTC. Even if this UASF fails (unlikely but possible), the price of BTC shouldn't go up (BU code is a slow motion train wreck - I can't imagine why people would want to park their money in it).

Depends on how it's implemented and by whom. Except Core other teams have proven unable to create anything ready for testnet, let alone mainnet. 
And that doesn't have anything to do with SegWit. 2MB should be developed and tested after the effects of SegWit are observed on mainnet. 
It'd be completely insane to commit to a hard fork to 2MB for code that doesn't even exist just in order to get SegWit enabled. No way. SW first.

On SW, I agree, but I think that is going to be addressed by UASF BIP148 (and subsequent changes). 
Open Source: maybe you're right on that. Personally I don't care much about this as long as the approach works for the purpose (which is to ensure equal accessibility to all mining rig makers). I suspect the most likely benefactor of an Open Source design would be one Mr. Wu (the largest supplier) which wouldn't be great and would somewhat defeat the purpose.

You can have 2 Bitcoin Core's (legacy and UASF BIP148) and 2 Electrum executables and run them in parallel (one legacy, one BIP148). Or 1 Electrum, but you need to keep in mind which one you're using. 
You can split BTC on Aug 1 and sell/trade/use "both" copies as long as the chains are separate. After Aug 1 you won't be able to send from one chain to the other, but if the coins aren't split then replay attacks may be possible on the other chain (which is why the coins should be split on Aug 1 if you're planning to transact during that time of 2 chains).

I know business owner have other worries, there's a lot of investor money at stake and the last thing they need is shaky grounds below them. That all stands.
But - also to be honest - in capitalism everyone is responsible for their own business. Just as a UASF-er doesn't share your risks, he doesn't stand to benefit from your success (indirectly he does, but that's a 2nd derivative). 
I also can't call on you to support USAF BIP148 just because down the road my stash may become less fungible or more regulated or anything else that doesn't suit my needs or interest.
Maybe (I don't know) non-miner Bitcoin-based businesses could have fixed this uncertainty by aligning with Core, for example. I think every one of those that demands a commitment on big blocks before SW is activated did some thinking, analysis and basic math and said "okay, if I align with Bitmain I stand to do better". 
"UASF trolls" are now making businesses that aligned with Bitmain nervous. You need(ed) to hedge your bets or choose more carefully. 
It's your choice on how you act, but if I believe I stand to do worse, I have the right to vote with my BTC (because that will be the only thing that matters, if the chains split) for my choice. 
Businesses have 60 days to endorse UASF BIP148 and get over it. Or persuade the DCG Agreement parties to start "immediately" signaling for SW. Or pressure Bitmain to do a MASF BIP148. 
If you re-calculate "net present value" of your choice and it still makes more sense for your investors or yourself to fight it out in a chain split, that's cool.

As I said both above in here[1], starting August 1 all Bitmain (non-SegWit signaling) miners will be **banned from participating in the BIP148 chain** as long as they block SegWit. 
UASF BIP148 users will **boycott** the legacy miners. Users will move to **another chain**. No-SegWit miners and users can do whatever they want. They don't have to process our transactions. We don't care.

Core devs made a big mistake when they didn't come up with a UASF option in v0.14.

I did a very limited - probably invalid too (but I didn't have time and I thought if I delay I'll forget about this conversation) - test with blockchain synchronization.
* VM1 - bitcoind 0.14.1 - synced up with pretty much default settings
* VM2 - btcd (from master) - set to connect to VM1 alone
* VM3 - bitcoind 0.14.1 UASF SegWit 0.14.1 0.3 BIP148 - same
I tried to measure system utilization and time required to sync from scratch and bitcoind was significantly faster. In the past (Bitcoin Core 0.12) I seem to recall btcd was faster.
Unfortunately I didn't test other things. I know there's a bench script in Bitcoin Core but I'm not sure if it can be used against btcd and whether all the API methods would work... Like I said I didn't have much time. With a more time and resources (e.g. to run a test from a cloud VM and try to use many connections rather than one) I'm sure results would be much better for btcd.
By the way, now I know what your commit does. Yesterday I didn't look at the code of your commit, but today as soon as I hit the error because of the uacomment used by Bitcoin Core UASF, I though "Ahhh, okay..." 
There's a lot to like about btcd.

 &gt; Miners only need an exchange in order to mine a coin not users.
It has to have a non-zero price to be sellable.


Merge mined coins yes, but selling the main product at $0 isn't a sustainable business.


We know that. Mycelium, Electrum and others are on board so the full node part is less of a problem now.


Okay, now we're talking. What happens if 30% of transactions switch to the BIP148 chain and stay there? 30% of miners go there too. The transactions confirm cheaper, users feel it's good. 
Now what Bitmain does? Attack the BIP148 chain? Process transactions on their chain for free? They're in trouble, IMO.

In theory none of us should give a crap whether the SEC approves this ETF. In fact a sane person should be against it, simply because the less government presence and involvement with BTC there is, the better.
But there are so many statist &amp; investor-types involved in BTC now that this will-they-won't-they crap has become a major topic of 2017 while UASF can't gather more than 6% of full nodes.
Sadly Bitcoin is prone to shitification just like everything else the government touches. All it takes is to dangle the prospect of a 10% fiat gain in front of the clueless sheeple.

Thanks, that's interesting. 
If you're familiar with the debate and situation, what do you think about the huge market share of Bitmain-associated miners and the current transaction fees? I wonder what you think about that. 
I would suggest that BTC is more likely go *lower* if UASF BIP148 doesn't work out because that would ensure that tx fees will keep going up for many months, slow down all SegWit related development as well as lower Core's chances to protect decentralization of Bitcoin.

That's not what I meant. What we wanted is to The HQs to make the product (such as `-bip148` or better). 
If the factory did a market research with product sampling earlier, maybe `-bip148=1` would have been a hit by now. 


I haven't seen any indication that it will or won't be adopted. I base my estimate  (`-bip148=0` vs UASF vs BarryCoin) on what I read and BarryCoin doesn't seem rejected as the other two are. Maybe that's because it's not done and I hope that's the real reason why, although enough is known to consider it worse than the other two.

I won't elaborate much on this since we went off topic, but a consistent attitude would be to have no issue with this anywhere. If you agree one person shouldn't be coerced by the State to hand over their income to the government (engage in exchanging their savings for State-made goods and services she doesn't want) then you should have a hard time justifying that another person should not be allowed this freedom. People should be free of coercion and free to engage in *voluntary* exchange of goods and services. That's what Bitcoin is primarily about.

As far as I can tell:
a) If BIP148 starts with 51% of hash rate it is effectively BTC.
b) If BIP148 starts with (say) 1% of hash rate and climbs to 51%, then it will reach parity with BTC. Between Aug 1 and until it is available it's going to be traded at $SOME exchange rate to "BTC".
They would (should) support BIP148 because:
a) they make money from people trading it
b) they can't wait till Aug 1 to decide about that (too late); they need to add support for BTC variants before Aug 1

I haven't found the answer to this question.
Isn't Purse working with Bitmain? It's hopeless to talk to them.
In my opinion the main argument is do we want a Jihan or Corporate Coin, or Bitcoin as it was envisioned. 
If the latter, then it's UASF BIP148 or nothing. 
I'm concerned there are way too many scammers, traders and various corporate types on board to fix Bitcoin now. I'm going to put my money on UASF BIP148 and if it doesn't work, fuck it, I'm not going back to legacy.

You're against SegWit, I am *not* against 2MB hard fork, and you're trying to persuade me that 2MB is good. 
I don't care whether the maximum block size is 1 or 2 MB. 2MB is fine if it works well. The process has to be the same as for SegWit - design, implementation, testnet, mainnet. BU has so far shown complete incompetence and produced shit. Core could help them, but BU has blown 1 year on stalling SegWit and delayed Core from doing their homework so thanks to that you can say goodbye to 2MB maximum block size until 2019. Great job!

@_date: 2017-05-07 18:01:17
My point is "a lot of fees" may be true, but a miner can't process everything (which is why there's a backlog, because both the miners and the network can't take all those fees even if they wanted to).
A miner will look at the pool and mine transactions with higher fees first. 
The fact that many tx pay *some* fees - even if they're decent - doesn't entitle them to being processed. Many of those transactions floating around for days without getting any confirmations are *not worth* processing. Otherwise they wouldn't remain unprocessed.
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:50:51
With a small catch that if you receive coins on the losing chain, if you had access to it during the split you could sell them or buy something with them while you still can.

Bigger blocks have the opposite effect on decentralization. It makes it harder and harder - until it becomes impossible - to run a full node and ultimately results in gradual disappearance of non-corporate full nodes. 


Absolutely.

The supply is the same, but they'll be on the market so I get that.
But there is also demand. Where do people who missed the recent jump buy BTC? Aren't the China exchanges closed? If LocalBitcoins was the only means of getting BTC lately, then there should be a lot of new demand as well.
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:00:55
Yes, you're right. 
The UASF community has been saying from Day 1: we aim to win the economic majority, meaning people who send/receive bitcoins. If we do, then miners will mine where there's money to be made (and that's where transactions are occurring.)


Well, depends what you mean by "dishonest". If they are running fake UASF BIP148 nodes - those which don't have the patch but only use `uacomment=BIP148 / BU Bozos` in `bitcoin.conf` (they probably are, but it doesn't matter in any case) then **they won't end up on the UASF BIP148 chain.**
If they're "real fake" BIP148 nodes (from the UASF repo, Bitcoin Core SegWit 0.3 UASF BIP148, the current version of which has the User Agent string `"/Satoshi:0.14.1/UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148)/"`) meant to create - I don't know what - confusion - then it still doesn't matter. The owner can use them to create transactions on August 1st, or not. If they transact, that will help BIP148. If they don't, it's the same as if they don't exist. 
So what they're doing is completely useless.  The only minor inconvenience is they make UASF BIP148 node count stats which we use to see how we're doing in terms of awareness, less useful. But we can simply ignore Amazon.com IPs because real UASF nodes are mostly home-based.
Also see this post: 
The BU shills refuse to listen and learn and they expect that users will install their shitty hard-fork Bitcoin software with 2MB support. 
What a horrifying thought! Would you trust them with your BTC?
Or, if they eventually take over which is likely if this UASF doesn't take off, would you trust Bitcoin? Why would you? 
It's great they're creating headlines for BIP148 - I love that.

This means:
1) You can't sell or spend any in any given year without reporting this to the Uncle
2) The more BTC goes up, the more tax you stand to pay when you sell or spend.
 2a) I haven't checked, but I wonder why would the IRS let you simply transfer your BTC to another (undeclared) address outside of the exchange without asking you to clarify who owns it. If you could do that then you would effectively never need to pay any capital gains. That seems too good to be true.
3) The longer you hodl, the more exposed to the risk of hacker theft or government confiscation you are.
4) I cannot imagine that having a BTC address known to the government does not put you on some sort of list that's cross referenced against various "events" in your state, city or neighborhood.
tl;dr: you need to worry all the time.

You can not buy bitcoin and stay safe.
I suggest you buy $10 worth first if $5K is more than you can afford to lose.
Edit: the reason I suggest to not buy BTC (or buy a very small amount first) is if you don't understand it, it's more likely you'll get screwed soon. It's better to get robbed of $10 in BTC than $5,000. 
Related to this, I didn't want to point out the obvious but since I'm editing this comment: if you haven't bought before and now want to sink $5K into BTC, this suggests you may be in "panic buying" mode. Not a good idea to sink a ton of money into anything when you're in such a mode, so again, buy a little and hope you get swindled early so that next time you buy more you don't die from heart attack.

It actually works the same until August 1st. 
On August 1st (UTC) it starts to refuse new blocks that aren't created by SegWit-supporting miners.
The idea is to take back the control of Bitcoin and force the activation of SegWit which has been delayed by many months and causes Bitcoin development to stagnate and users to suffer. 
On August 1st, depending on which version you use to transact, the BIP148 version may behave differently from the "default" Core version (or not, if UASF BIP148 succeeds quickly).

I don't think there will be any bugs either, but there will be big changes elsewhere. 
For example Bitmain may move on to abuse some other coin and many bitcoin startups that count on Bitmain's vision of Bitcoin may suddenly find themselves wondering what to do next. Their investors too. If there's less quick money slushing around, maybe the price goes down further. 
Or maybe the central bankster-hating masses decide to buy more BTC after they realize Bitmain has been defeated.

If dates and timing are TBD, some folks from the list may not accept the final terms.
I didn't notice one person was authorized to make the final decision at a later time.
Further negotiations have to be conducted, in which case the agreement is basically a "draft" agreement.


No implementation details, no deadlines/dates, no code, no written or digital signatures. 
That doesn't sound legit. 
Does the agreement have all the essential parts or is it half-baked/draft/conceptual?

In other words, the NY agreement has the third - unstated - goal to prevent any possibility of SegWit adoption without a HF for 2MB blocks. 


The two elements were to start signaling for SW and lock in HF.
The third is to block current SW signaling and prevent it from happening before UASF BIP148 or normal signaling rules.
I can't believe that Core would allow this to be released in Bitcoin Core.

I thought so too, but was hesitant to offer critique. 
The alleged behavior (by the Fed/CBs) would result in inflation because it would be easy to create an ever growing number of shitcoins and cash out to buy $ANYTHING in the real world.
No one I know would argue that the question whether the Fed can destroy Bitcoin by buying "all" the coins is silly, yet in this post the same silliness is assumed across the board (Bitcoin, shitcoins and even the stupid Ripple).

Yes we can (sorry for the Obama reference).
Google "UASF BIP148" to find a site that tells you where to get the source (or signed binaries) and get to work.
This user-initiated soft fork is scheduled for August 1. We have a number of related articles on this subreddit - just search this subreddit for UASF BIP148.
Good questions, by the way. Bitmain and their "Bad Miner Cabal" control over 50% of the hashing power and the stupid mechanism requires 95% of all miners to agree to SegWit, so we're stuck. They're growing stronger by the day ($1 million in tx fees per day) while most of Core members are calling for more patience (it's been over 1 year).

Yes, at the very beginning if everyone thinks "BIP148 is dead" the BIP148 BTC will be close to 0 and "legacy" BTC will be 1 BTC (let's assume that's $2,200).
But if BIP148 is doing better than expected, your 1 "legacy" BTC may drop to $1,800 and your 1 BTC on the BIP148 chain may be $300.
At this time you would still have 1 BTC on the legacy chain and 1 BTC on the BIP148 chain.
If you now sell 1 "legacy" BTC, you get $1,800 and you still can sell, or hold, the BIP148 BTC. If you don't sell it and the BIP148 chain wins, you would finish with $1,800 and 1 BTC (not BIP148 BTC any more, because there would be only one chain).
This (in both directions) is how things may play out if exchanges list the both chains.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:52:19
Hi &amp; welcome.
1) Yes, it is called User-Activated because unlike normal activation of "new stuff", here we are trying to solve the obstruction issue by running a custom Bitcoin Core package which kicks in on August 1st 2017 (00:00:00 UTC). Then it refuses to accept any block that's not created by a SegWit-signaling miner. 
That will temporarily create 2 chains (soft fork) and leave you with the same amount of BTC on each chain. There are guides on what to do in that situation, depending on your goals. Many UASF BIP148 supporters will sell the legacy BTC and use their BIP148 BTC.
2) Yes, you should deploy a Bitcoin Core SegWit UASF BIP148 node - just google for `BIP148 UASF download` and get it from the Github.com repository (click on Releases tab).
3) Normal users who don't know shit should just install the Windows client (I assume that's what you have) and configure it according to normal Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 instructions. There are no UASF BIP148 specific instructions. 
Then you just run it. If you don't have 150 GB of free disk space, search on how to modify `bitcoin.conf` settings and add `prune=550` in the file, then restart.
On August 1st, the blockchain will split, so you'll need to mind how you act then. What matters is that you use this client to perform actual transactions - passive running without any transactions won't matter after August 1. The chain (side) which is more active will most likely win.

Cool. 
Yes I also dislike the `uacomment` thing because it doesn't do much and lasts only until Aug 1. It takes 1 min to edit bitcoin.conf, but it takes just 2 min to upgrade to UASF BIP148 so why not do it once and be done.
Don't know if you saw the comment in the Electrum ID post that in order to split BTC one has to send with RBF enabled. Don't know if that's 100% correct but the commenter seems knowledgeable about Electrum.

I think it's been a while since it's been clear that most people (users) prefer SegWit. Agreements have been singed, promises made, scandals exposed. If nothing has been accomplished in 12 months, why would it be in 14? Maybe this is wrong - maybe they're "working on a last month compromise" - but there's little reason to believe that.
The misbehaving miners *still* have more than 2 months to do a MASF BIP148 and kill this UASF. That's plenty of time. 
And UASF itself has been talked about for several months, so even between that point and now that UASF became a thing they had months to figure out where this is going *and lead*. Instead they chose to obstruct.
Predictably, many lost patience and now UASF is in full swing.
August may seem early but it's not. There's nothing to negotiate or prepare for, except if they intend to buy time to build a strategy against UASF. I can't come up with any other explanation why they need more time.
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:58:58
Good job. 
To fence-sitters reading this: if you don't want to see your bitcoin turn into shitcoin after August 1st, install *and use* a full node with UASF BIP148 patch. Installation is simple - same as regular Bitcoin Core. If you already have Bitcoin Core, upgrade it with this release according to normal procedures.

There's a site with FAQs and many articles on this subreddit to help you get started (for example:  
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:57:09
All you say makes sense. 
But the big blockers "envision" 1 TB blocks (that's what I was told by one their supporter yesterday) in the future so that no one but banks and next-gen TBTF's can run full nodes. 
They also say their 2MB code is "ready" to be deployed within weeks. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:40:47
That's unnecessary because idiots think their situation is somehow unique and a 3 week old article doesn't apply to their current situation which must be related to something that happened yesterday.

You'd have to be more specific (such as, where is the traffic or whatever this "attack" is, coming from).
If you had a non-BIP148 full node v0.14.1 running on this box before, then you could compare. If you haven't, then it requires analysis. 
Unlike in 0.12 or before, full nodes can get busy (in terms of network and I/O).

Electrum seems friendly but get started now to get familiar with it.
If you go to `Tools &gt; Network` you can point your wallet to the VM/Bitcoin Core instance (UASF or Legacy) which you want to use.
I haven't tried yet (and in any case now the both show the same balance), but Electrum seems reasonably suitable. You need to always remember which settings are currently active, of course.

Of course you didn't get it "back". Transactions aren't reversible.

Second, you're comparing a security exploit ( used to undermine PoW to zero threats contained in LN approach.

If you plan to receive or send BTC on that day, it may be risky. 
There will be transactions (as usual) on that day and they will happen on the both chains. But if you're not ready and/or your exchange isn't ready, if you transact that day you may lose money.

Maybe in you can add a link to the post on how to verify UASF binaries? ("Remember to verify the signatures!")

I don't care whether Bitcoin has "legitimacy" or whether its exchange rate goes up.
Yes, the value of Bitcoin is linked to its adoption. To me there's already enough adoption for my liking and needs, so at this point I don't care if the price goes up, remains the same or drops 30%. 
You seem to care about the price and you'd gladly give up the freedom to do whatever you want with your BTC in exchange for a 20% higher price. I wouldn't. That's the difference between you and I.

The question wasn't about your local laws but about the reasons why it *may* be wise to not let the government know you own BTC. This may be a factor for some and not for others.
Even if one just accumulates at an exchange and never spends, it's still a risk as mentioned elsewhere.

1) If you will touch (trade, receive, send) while the chains are split (for example, the first few days of August - may be longer?), you'll be at risk.
2) See this (applies to Polo as well):
IMO these non-BIP148 supporting exchanges have floated a very shitty excuse that they'll simply wait for a resolution. For example if you want to withdraw your coins as BIP148 BTC on August 1st, Polo won't let you. Or if you want to trade the BIP148 BTC chain while the chains are split, you're also fucked. Or if you want to sell "legacy" BTC and convert to BIP148 BTC while they're split, guess what - you're fucked!
Ask them to add BIP148 BTC support or move your BTC out - either to a paper wallet (if you want to sit this out) or to an exchange that does not willingly limit customers' choices and expose customers to risks.
@_date: 2017-05-28 07:30:26
Thanks for taking time to type this down. I'll also buy BIP148 BTC on Aug 1, as much as I can afford.
Exchanges that haven't announced plans to support BIP148 are exposing their customers to fairly significant risks. 
IMO a conclusion people should derive from  your **TL/DR** would be: if you **will** transact in early days of August, it's much safer (all other factors being equal) to **withdraw the crap out of your online wallet before August 1.**
**If you don't do anything, you can sit tight and wait it out but you won't be able to quickly react to opportunities and risks**. This should be seen as a terrible situation to be in. Just like owning time deposits in Wall Street banks in late 2008. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:55:39
I think that would be fine, but it will be hard to measure (and also organize, to make it register in blockchain metrics).
It's going to be great when people start withdrawing money from the exchanges and wallets who don't implement BIP148 (early, mid July?). 
That will hurt! We need to inform more people who use Bitcoin often about this. This is a good related topic:
@_date: 2017-05-15 07:48:07
That's true, but it shouldn't be forgotten that there's a cost associated with everything. 
While they can likely find that you own 3 undeclared BTC, they'd still have to spend maybe 30 BTC to do something about it, while - at least initially - it cost them just a legal opinion and one email to get a list of Coinbase customers.

They may be very cheap on Aug 1, compared to "legacy" BTC which should be priced 1 BTC initially. But I need to buy BTC just before Aug 1, to be able to buy BIP148 BTC on Aug 1.

Miners will mine where transactions happen.
UASF BIP148 needs just a small (20-30%) number of "tx traffic" to move to its chain to prevail. Once the momentum starts, it will continue and accelerate.

We don't know. 
The fake NY agreement signed by various companies that form the Malicious Miner Cabal ( contains no technical details so at this point no one really knows.
Maybe they'll attempt to create an ASICBoost-friendly hard-fork client. As Nancy would say, "You have to install our hard-fork client to see what's in it". If we get lucky we may even get the source code. Okay I'm just kidding, but so far Core developers haven't reviewed or endorsed this new code (because it's still vaporware at the moment).
Basically the agreement was made to deceive and delay BIP148, there's no details and no code, and now they're trying to come up with a way to "hard-bundle" SW with 2MB hard-fork code and force it on the community.

BIP148 can run alongside SW2X.

But it's going to an exciting time for those who seek excitement and profit. 
Because anyone with access to a BIP148 node can trade on the both chains, tons of money will be made while the chains are split, so trader types, speculators and such should definitively setup a BIP148 node or find a site that supports BIP148-related trading.

Don't change the user agent, that's just part of the equation. ("uacomment" instructions apply to bitcoind on all OS, by the way)
Go to uasf.co, click on the link to binaries (for OSX), download, validate if you want, decompress the archive, then run bitcoind located in bin sub-directory. It will automatically signal the right version. Refer to generic Bitcoin Core instructions for bitcoin.conf options - there's nothing UASF specific you need to do until August 1.

@_date: 2017-05-27 06:17:44
One more time: fake users don't matter. 
If you send or receive bitcoin on mainnet, you're a user, you transact. 
Whether that's 1 user doing a shitload of transactions every day or 100,000 users doing 1 transaction per day, that doesn't matter. What matters is where the activity happens. 
If you setup 10,000 UASF or any other nodes on Amazon, that won't do shit and nobody cares about that.
If users use the UASF BIP148 chain, Bitmain will lose and his opinion and hashing power is not going to help them.
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:36:31
Yes, if you want to use BIP148 or the both chains, it becomes a weekend project (if you're a newbie).
It's not very difficult to setup two nodes and use a wallet that works with Bitcoin Core RPC to switch between the chains, but that requires some basic-to-intermediate skills. 
Electrum is one such wallet.

I don't expect LN transactions to be so expensive as to become impractical. If you have 4 channels and open/close them once a month, that's 8 transactions so maybe $2. Is that unrealistic?


That's a broader question, but I look at it this way: I have many choices to lower my (fiat) tx fees, but I still use those that suit me best (convenience, security, etc.).
Bitcoin doesn't have to, and can't, process all tx but SW is only the first step. Bitcoin should aim to keep a high share of valuable transactions. Many (say, low value IoT tx) can use a "tempchain" and some won't need a chain at all.

Thank you. 
A 100% uptime requirement would be scary because it's not always under user's control - a hardware failure (such as disk failure), especially when it's unattended (e.g. you don't realize it happened) could be really bad. The likelihood of something like that happening *during* a critical step in the tumbling process is very small, but once it is better understood maybe it could be worked around with having a backup node ready. Of course it's best if it can be fixed or mitigated in software.
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:31:15
Yes, that is true. The obstructionist miners can decide to MASF BIP148 by 3pm if they want to. 
30% of the hashing power is signaling for SegWit so only 21% of the obstructionist miners could execute a MASF BIP148.


Read Jihan's tweets. The man is getting very nervous (tweeting massacre photos) and it's only May. They could cave in sooner.


But you'd hurt all your customers (exchanges, wallet providers) because they'd lose funds in transactions during the split. 
The optimal play would be to execute BarryCoin or just do a MASF BIP148 and spend money on actual development of 2MB code rather than invest in low quality companies to create a JihanCoin. But they're investing in those anyway because their definition of "win" is "control".
The worst outcome for Bitmain is if it comes to UASF and they happen to win. They just don't get it.

But if you paid an even lower fee you'd probably be looking at 0 confirmations after 24 hours.
Also Polo is slower to send, so you should really count since the time the (unconfirmed) transaction appears, not from the time when you approve withdrawal.
A quick way to force SegWit and lower transaction fees is to setup your UASF BIP148 and use that node to transact following August 1st.

After soft-fork in Aug 1, there will be 2 chains (at least initially). 
Simple answer: you should split your coins if you plan to transact on either of the chains before they merge.
I think this procedure applies to soft fork splits as well (you can make sure in the Electrum community):

There's UASF Pool and Slash allows you to set preference to UASF BIP148.
There's a risk of attack by known actors, but the incentive to non-maliciously mine is there. Medium.com has a game-theory centric post as to why. Incentive to mine on BI0148 isn't "huge", but it's significantly larger than to mine it maliciously or not at all.

They would consider supporting UASF if NYA participants maliciously sabotaged the agreement.

They seem doable with SegWit and don't require Nov 1 HF.

@_date: 2017-05-30 19:25:24
At this point the situation is like this:
* One company and their minions control over 50% of the hashing rate of Bitcoin, effectively making it a CompanyCoin. Now they're also making changes to Bitcoin Core software that they plan to push on to all users as mandatory upgrade for all who want to use CompanyCoin by early 2018 (without using this version you won't be able to join the network). Their software is supposed to be released in late July and activated immediately.
* A small but growing movement of users, centered around UASF BIP148 (soft-forked SegWit activation by users) code, is trying to unfuck the situation. This soft-fork software is available now, but it's supposed to be activated on August 1.
* Only one of these will survive, and on August 1 there may be a split where temporary there will be two Bitcoins. 
In my opinion BTC will start sliding as soon as people who think they're buying the dip realize it's actually a dead cat bounce - for both technical and fundamental (Bitcoin is in crisis) reasons. Then if The Company prevails in August, BTC will sink even further.
I wouldn't be surprised if it drops to below $1,000. Until last week I thought it will correct to $1,600-ish by July and begin to recover once The Company realizes they can lose (and lose) or win (but lose) if they continue like that. But they doubled down since (search for `FrankenSegWit`), so I think it will get much worse.

Those who run a full node (UASF BIP148, of course) just need to point Electrum to it in `Tools &gt; Network`.
In my case I run Electrum on Windows and Bitcoin Core UASF BIP148 on Linux, but if it's the same system, then `localhost` will do.

Overall with his objections against SegWit he's wrong, but I must say I don't like that the discount was administratively decided. I don't know if there is/was a better approach to pricing this discount - maybe this is as good/close as it gets - but if depending on it the incentive may be an incentive for *users*, and a slight subsidy from the miners to the users. If it is, then of course they aren't happy with it. Again, maybe there was no better way, and at the same time that doesn't make this approach good or the only good approach.
As a Bitcoin user I support SegWit, but we shouldn't like this discount just because it's part of SegWit.

I think NYA miners can ensure SW2X before August 1st, but for that they need 80% of hashpower. If Jihan doesn't want SegWit, he can make SW2 fail either completely (by not helping BIP91 reach 80%) or partially (by helping it lock, but not activate BIP91). I don't know which of these makes most sense for him (because there's also the question of covert ASICboost and its benefits (which are hard to estimate) and and how these events will affect the upcoming HF).

As far as I understand Core devs want to observe and measure effects of SegWit and use that knowledge to make sure that later improvements are done in a stable and optimal manner.

Yes. (Later I noticed (in the linked Bitcoin Magazine article) there's one place where the author interchangeably used ACTIVE and LOCKED_IN.)


Here's what the BM article says: "BIP91 nodes will reject any non-SegWit signalling blocks if, and only if, 80 percent of blocks first indicate within two days that’s what they’ll do."
It seems Jihan could remove 21% of hashpower after lock-in and then SW2X's SW activation would fail. Then BIP148 would split off on Aug 1, at which point he could use a week to destroy BIP148 and later still decide to go along with SW2 and help activate SW sometime in August (or not help activate it and let it run like that until Nov 1?). He'd lose the fight against SW but if he succeeded to destroy BIP148 chain he'd demoralize miners who attempted to break off (may pay off in November?).

To be fair we should also consider the possibility that the congestion is created by Core or LN or UASF supporters, but I think that's less likely.
Fake UASF nodes: certainly that would cause confusion and maybe significant fluctuations in the price, but UASF owners are willing to soft-fork regardless of whether we have a majority or not and apart from the hardcore mafia (Bitmain) other miners would be hurting much more than UASF users.


I'd too, but they won't, so what are we going to do about it?

@_date: 2017-05-29 19:29:03
OK, fine!
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:21:35
Yes, activating and running it should do the job of having a full node on the UASF BIP148 chain. From that point on, you may still need to do additional things depending on your goals.
For example, if you just want to have a full node to "show support UASF" until August 1, you don't have to do anything but run it.
As I mentioned above on August 1, this full node will start refusing blocks from non-Segwit miners, so it will diverge from the "main" chain and from that point on, the side with more transactions will prevail. 
If you want to actively engage in making UASF BIP148 succeed, you need to send/receive on the BIP148 chain after August 1st. 
You can accomplish that by using a mobile wallet that supports BIP148 (there are several such wallets, but Mycelium isn't one of them - you could ask them why) **or** by moving your coins to your home UASF BIP148 node *prior to Aug 1st* and using that node to send/receive after Aug 1st. 
If you're not good at Bitcoin it's probably easier to ask Mycelium to make this option available, or change the wallet (to Samourai + home UASF BIP148 node, or Electrum + home UASF BIP148 node).
How to move funds from Mycelium: you can export the private key and import BTC from it using your UASF BIP148 node:
a) Export: 
b) Import: use Samourai or Electrum or Bitcoin-Qt instructions for importing private key
Mycelium should let users be able to connect on the both chains (UASF and the legacy) so that you can receive and send on both. If on August 1 Mycelium lets you use only the legacy chain, you may not be able to receive from UASF BIP148 users. And UASF users won't be able to receive from you.
If you had a way to use the both, you could send/receive from all users. Right now you want a choice of using the post-Aug 1 BIP148 chain, you need to import private key from Mycelium on your home node before Aug 1st. Any tx before Aug 1st will appear in the both wallets (UASF BIP148 at home, and Mycelium) while any after that will appear on the chain where they were made, until such time one of the chains loses (which would make transactions made on that chain since Aug 1 invalid). 
You can read this to understand details about staying on one or the other (or the both) chains:
You could also share this with Mycelium support if you decide to ask them to support UASF BIP148.
If you don't want the trouble or are afraid you'll make a mistake and lose bitcoins, then just let that node run and don't mess with the wallet. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:08:03
You can do nothing, especially if you are not going to use the wallet right after Aug 1.
Or you can install Bitcoin Core UASF BIP148 version and on Aug 1 split your coins and have the same amount on each chain ("legacy" and BIP148).
See this:
How to split coins (please verify with Electrum community if this procedure also applies to soft forks):
If you expect to use wallet to send or receive in the first week of August, I would suggest to not "do nothing".

What happens is this: 
If you use wallet from Aug 1 until the chains merge or one forks, you may lose BTC. One way is to not use it and another is to move to a provider (including your own Bitcoin Core node(s)) that provides access to your BTC on the both chains.
Take a look at Electrum, Samourai, and likely Mycelium.

@_date: 2017-05-28 19:28:11
I like that because you're paying attention :-)
BIP148 (not 184) shouldn't be pissing you off because the way it works is this: if users such as yourself don't use that fork, it will not succeed and we'll return to the current state of constantly new negotiations, stalling and high transaction fees.
BIP148 is effectively an economic boycott of the miners who are against SegWit. If and only if enough users boycott the malicious cabal, SegWit will take effect immediately. 
In the meantime nothing prevents the 70 or so percent of the non-SegWit signaling miners to start signaling today, any time before BIP148 or later. 
So BIP148 doesn't delay anything, it's only a users-led movement to make SegWit happen faster.

I'm not at all familiar with BitFury, but my feeling is on the one hand they were fooled into being part of this and on the other hand once you get a lot invested in a business it becomes hard to see risky moves as good choices, so you want to minimize risk and seek compromise (slipper slope effect).

Absolutely, move your coins "home" or to another site that doesn't expose customers' funds to risks and provides the choice to trade and own BTC on both chains.
Also, if you want to have fun on Aug 1, you can use Electrum to split your coins to "double" them (same amount on each chain) and have some fun trading them on exchanges that support BIP148 (in addition to legacy BTC) :-)
Bittylicious is one of them.

1) *Anyone* who makes transactions during chain split is at risk. 
2) Coinbase is putting you at risk, that's what Luke's article was trying to tell you. If someone (including you) sends coins to your Deposit address on Coinbase after August 1 and BIP148 wins on August 2, your coins will be evaporated.
Here's how to reach out to Coinbase and ask them to add support for BIP148 and avoid willingly exposing their users to risk.

BB I agree with dh's point about the leadership.  
The leader or leadership should have someone with technical expertise and a good resume in IC design and also someone highly respected in the Bitcoin user community. Then it may be possible to raise funds and fill smaller (less critical) roles as the project kicks off.
Open-sourcing the design IMO isn't necessary, there are other models that could be more sustainable.
I think one problem for potential investors right now is the ongoing   disagreement between various (but mostly two) camps in the community. Worst case scenario (for investors, not users): BTC splits in two, with the ASICBOOST guys controlling one side, and users bent on changing the PoW algo controlling the other. 
Maybe the latter would be open to collaboration, but I doubt people would want to give this project money in advance without a clearly defined mission, roadmap, milestones, etc.

I do have plenty of resources (about 10x more than I need). 
I don't understand what you're trying to prove here. I chose to run a full node, but if someone wants to run a SPV client, or nothing at all, I don't care. 
My point is simply that the fact that SPV or nothing at all may be good enough for some, that doesn't mean that *no one* needs the ability to run a full node. 
This has nothing to do with the current or future block size. The debate is whether or not the ability to run a full node is important and desired by many users and the answer is yes.

It doesn't have to be "significant", it has to be non-zero. 


We will be able to trade BIP148 BTC for "Legacy" BTC. As long as neither is worth $0.
Also Bitfinex is working on futures/options or something like that.


Nobody will lose anything. 
You can split your legacy BTC and keep your legacy BTC on the legacy chain. If UASF BIP148 fails, you end up with your legacy BTC. 
I may lose some money because I want to - I'll sell some legacy BTC for BIP148 BTC, but the pessimists can simply use BIP148 BTC (if anyone accepts them) "for free", so to speak (assuming the BIP148 fails) while the chain is split.

I didn't read their (Ver *et al*) complaints carefully enough, I just know they don't mean the actual price of SW transactions but relative to non-SW transactions right now. I *think* they believe SW witness discount is set to too high. 
Personally I don't have a position on this - I only dislike that witness discount is fixed. 
SW among other things aims to "discourage" the creation of UTXOs, and the reason it's 75% is because UTXO's "cost" 4x to clean up than to create. If it was up to miners to figure it out, maybe it'd actually "cost" 3.8x or 5.12x and they'd figure it out on their own. At the same time it's unreasonable to expect a flexible/dynamic discount or similar complex schemes in the initial production version, so I can understand why that may be a reasonable trade-off of complexity, reliability, etc.

Corporate support (especially of the predatory and parasitic kind that you can find in Shitereum circles) is a sign for me to say away not only from Shitereum but also from the kind of Bitcoin the recent fake Barry Silbert agreement tries to impose on the users.

1) You can wait &amp; do nothing. Bitmain is ruining it for you.
2) BIP148 can't "ruin" anything. The moment the Bitmain Cabal starts signaling for SegWit the chains will merge. Or if they signal before August 1, we'll have cheaper transactions in August and beyond.

I bought my first when the price was in double digits, then sold too quickly and bought/sold 2-3 times since then. Never made significant bucks from it. 
Most recently (like 10-14 days ago?) I bought some after I became convinced our BIP148 campaign will succeed. Now I feel confident enough to hold BTC. But I could lose it all and wouldn't feel bad about it.

It's incorrect to praise entire generations. As in every generation, most people are anti-freedom and seek to benefit at the expense of others. 
I noticed most young folks have no clue about free markets and how freedom actually works. They tend to be more (socially) liberal or "tolerant", but even that often works against freedom (as they often seek to impose their standards on the rest of population).

Well, yes.
On the one hand, if you don't want to be cut off from accessing your BTC during chain split (on Aug 1 and later), then you need to write to your exchange to ask them to add BIP148 BTC support.
On the other, if they don't want to do that, then you can decide to sit it out (and be unable to securely send/receive/trade) or withdraw to a local node (wallet) or another exchange. 
So it'd be less hassle if the exchanges didn't risk their customers' funds, but if they decide to do that they'll see a lot of withdrawals and lose a lot of revenue during that time. If they decide to cooperate they can make a lot more in fees and keep their customers.

IMO a big risk that does exist is that in case the Centralization Artists win, there will be fewer reasons to hodl or use a centralizing Bitcoin. Of course not for all, but for many. The influx of noobs and clueless "investor" types may make that less noticeable, or not at all - who knows.

Yes but some such PoW is also very bandwidth intensive, so 2 CPUs with 1TB of RAM wouldn't give good results.
I guess you mean 3D Xpoint-based chips that support Optane (and there are 2-3 similar technologies). Those can be used as RAM but I think they're still few orders of magnitude slower (which is much faster than SSD, but not fast enough) if PoW is bandwidth intensive as well as RAM intensive.

Long time reader, first time poster?


We (UASF BIP148) start building our own chain.


The UASF chain keeps going.


Yes the supporting miners would be split on the BIP148 chain. 
UASF BIP148 *likely* needs just about 1/3 of the miners to win, because the other chain (Bitmain chain) is going to be hopeless - all their work is likely to eventually be reorg'd and rolled back (once they lose out and merge with the BIP148 chain). If the BIP148 chain doesn't die right away, it makes more sense to mine on it, than elsewhere (or against it).
If 1/3 of all the hashing power attacks either chain they can do that but the result is they simply waste their money. It's better to mine and in such case it's better to mine on the BIP148 chain than the other *if* economic activity moves to that chain.
Divide and conquer: the miners will likely go to the chain on which users conduct their economic activity. If the BIP148 chain doesn't have enough support from **users**, it won't command enough economic activity and it will lose miner support.

These are less than 10% and yesterday we learned Slush Pool will signal BIP91 (probably with 50% of their "votes") so we can split their share to 1.8%. So it's 1.4% + 1.8 % + 3.6%. Maybe there are some other small pools that will "score" soon, but in any case, nothing over 10%. No way non-BIP91 pools will have a 21% or higher share in the next 84 blocks.

BCC is another coin, why do you refer to it as "stolen"? 
I don't like those guys and I don't give a crap about BCC, but at the same time I don't consider what they do there as stealing...
This is a problem (not specific to this post, but I'll mention it anyway): many bitcoin fans can't define what bitcoin is, in terms of property.

There are many existing miners out there. 
They can mine the valid chain or go crazy and mine on another chain. If they choose the latter, what obligation do we have to use their services and help them recoup their investment?
A PoW would hurt all miners, not just the malicious ones, but unfortunately there's no way to create per-miner PoW and just like in the example above, no obligation exists to do that.


No, we want miners to **not** risk everything and mine on BIP148 chain. Those who want to risk everything will mine other chain(s).

@_date: 2017-07-28 03:34:19
Exactly what I said in my previous [comment]( - if your exchange doesn't plan to operate BCC, it's unreasonable to ask them to help you with the split. Unless they state they plan to support BCC *and* help customers split their BTC/BCC, those who dislike that *and* want to have "their" BCC can move their BTC elsewhere.

But wouldn't a significant amount of BIP148 BTC purchases, or a higher BIP148:BTC price ratio, demonstrate sizeable demand for BIP148 miner services? 
Legacy miners (which you talk about when you say being unable to sell their coinbase BTC) can be able to sell them, but at a crappy or declining price. Wouldn't that be enough of a threat? 
Another issue is that Bitmain and NYA people ("investors") have enough cash to buy up all BTC mined in August (and beyond), so in practical terms BTC-denominated prediction markets would likely be manipulated to paint the "right" picture. 
If there's a chance to change the PoW algo, things will be different.

@_date: 2017-07-04 05:36:54
Oh... "Electorate" in your previous comment was quite confusing.
Cloud mining investment lends itself to Ponzification - as the guy above said usually you need to buy a "contract" which both locks you in and increases risks (which may exist even if they try to operate honestly; for example they either have to pre-purchase hardware (risky) or sell contracts first and then **try** to purchase hardware (risky, but also potentially fraudulent if you engage in various "financing" schemes and don't outright buy hardware that's supposed to deliver the contracts).
Nicehash allows you to buy from many "suppliers" and you can buy in very small time increments. Furthermore they don't own any of that hashpower and so it's unlikely they would deliberately go bust with your prefunded wallet loaded with a significant amount of BTC. In other words, they're just a market maker, and if you don't get the hashpower you paid for, they're supposed to mediate and remedy the situation before you have a ton of money at risk. 
I don't know how effective they are at that, but at least if you spot something weird you can stop the same day and wait for a resolution, so you can feed your wallet 1-2 days at a time and have no significant exposure to their service.

"We all" will opt **in** for SegWit, and leave Bitmain out in the cold. Then they can either attack, join us, or stay out (or try all of the above). If they fail to kill us, then their chips may become useless, but there will be no miner outage (because Bitmain's miners can mine on BIP148 chain if they don't want to lose money).

UASF certainly needs the users and economic activity, and that's perfectly fine. If that's not what the users want, UASF deserves to fail.

**To the first**: yes, and this isn't anything new. Earlier today in my comments I said the *only* significance of the node count is for us to measure effectiveness of our outreach. 
But since you're a clueless shill, you read that and think that means what you think it means (that the node count matters). It doesn't.
**To the second**: same issue: you think you know what it means, but you're clueless and it doesn't mean what you think it means.
The second quote means that *after August 1st* people who support UASF BIP148 nodes should run them and use them if they want UASF BIP148 to prevail. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 13:03:29
Yes. 
A growing number of UASF nodes should help motivate some of them to switch over because they'll realize there will be no bad consequences for them if the signaling percentage reaches 50 plus percent. 
Without UASF users a pool that depends on Bitmain may not be willing to signal for SW or "conspire" on this with others because whatever they do they can't hit 95%. With UASF they need just a handful of pools to join them in order to make Segwit a reality.
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:59:52
UASF BIP148 is the last thing that prevents Bitcoin turning into a shitcoin.
People aren't selling because part has no understand of what is happening, part doesn't give a crap and trades on hype/bubble/mania, part are newbs because they saw in fake news media that everyone bought at $8 and got insanely rich.
I am very low on BTC now and may buy again if UASF successfully demonstrates that cartels and crony corporations can be broken.

I don't know whether SSD would help you make more connections - it's not just up to IO but also CPU and network. For example if your network is high latency, clients may simply choose to connect to lower latency nodes elsewhere.
I keep just 8 connections and still can hit 2 MB/s "seeding" speed (when I get connections from clients that need to sync their blockchain). Mostly it's only 2-3 KB/s, and I think that's because my latency isn't very good (despite SSD) so clients connect to me only if there's nothing better out there.....

We weren't "lower than that". 
We were over 79% and about 60 percent into the voting period when I first commented and out of 60 prior blocks at that point only 1 was non-BIP91 (so 98% likely voting in favor for the remaining 40%). 
Even with variance it was clear the chance is extremely high. 32% is laughable.

From  2017-07-20 13:14:00 UTC/GMT
Current blockchain height: 476701
205 of 254 blocks are signaling Segwit2x (80.7%).
49 of 254 blocks are not signaling Segwit2x. This cannot surpass 67 if Segwit2x is to be activated this 336 block period.
Next period starts in 84 blocks (block: 476785), in approximately 14 hours.
Last update: 2017-07-20 13:14:00 UTC/GMT
Until 18 blocks ago math experts on this topic were telling me that SW2X had a 32% chance to activate...
18 blocks later, non-BIP91 pools (3 small ones, probably less than a 10% share) have to mine 18 out of 84 blocks (more than 21% of all blocks) in order to prove them right. (And Slushpool yesterday stated they'll start signaling BIP91 today which is another factor.)

There are volunteer-run Electrum servers (which connect to BIP148 servers) so in that case you don't need your own.

Nope. If you Tor *was* setup correctly, the new version of Core or UASF BIP148 doesn't change anything - in fact not a single line in bitcoin.conf has to be changed with UASF BIP148. So the only possible reason is you didn't have Tor, or didn't know how to setup Bitcoin Core with Tor to begin with. 
As far as Tor is concerned Bitcoin Core UASF SegWit BIP148 1.0 works the same as Bitcoin Core 0.14.2. If you setup Core with Tor and that setup doesn't work with UASF BIP148 with Tor, that would be on-topic.

It's called SegWit. There's no agreement among the miners on whether to effect it, so part of the user community has decided to take matters in their hands. More on that here:

A lot more could be achieved if back-end was changed to a NOSQL database, but that may take many years and it doesn't seem feasible at the moment. 
In any case, as the article points out there are several other, important reasons why users who own a non-insignificant amount of bitcoin should run a full node, whether a large-scale SPV infrastructure is feasible or not.

You can split yourself off the main chain if you run UASF BIP148 while the majority of economic power doesn't agree with you.
But at the outset (let's ignore SW2X for a moment), on August 1st, you're almost guaranteed to fork yourself (with BIP148). So if you stick to that UASF.co advice you'll never run BIP148 (or at least not until it becomes unnecessary). 
The advice makes sense for lazy or wavering users who'd bitch and moan how they "lost money" running UASF BIP148 (for this or that reason). 
The advice isn't useful for "BIP148 or nothing" users.

I'm probably not much more technical than you, but I see it the same way. 
If BIP149 makes sense then BIP148 makes even more sense. 
I think that Core is now doing the same thing that BitFury did by participating in the "agreement" - they mean well, but actually do a disservice. 
If BIP148 isn't merged by Bitcoin Core very soon, then the argument that BIP149 is better because it gives everyone more time becomes correct - a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
Also there's no schedule to fix CVE-2017-9230. In the meantime Bitmain are clearing $1 million in tx fees every day.

I was referring to that comment that implied it would be foolish to stop at $1.9 million if you can continue to $3.8 million.

Say you bought 1 BTC at $1K and transferred to your "external" account when it was $1.1K and at the end of fiscal year BTC closed at $1.3K. 
Best case is you'd still have to declare that income ($100/BTC), but should they one day find out the destination address also belonged to you, then you would have an additional $200/BTC of undeclared income. 
Because the IRS statute of limitations using this approach is essentially a mid-term bet against their tracking technology. Doesn't sound like a good deal to me. Maybe it's OK to have a Coinbase account for trivial "legal" spending, but even that flags one as a bitcoin user. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:21:31


There's no "by itself". The nodes signaling BIP148 don't matter at all. What matters is where users take their business.


Miners have pressure to decide and pick the right side.


Wait and see is not neutral; it's biased and it's against their customers' best interests. BIP148-hostile exchanges that remain biased after August 1st put their customers at risk. (

Estimates about the required "minimum" percentage have been provided here several times. On Aug 1 00:00:00 UTC 25-30% sounds about enough. By 3pm you could have 51%, if the BIP148 chain is where the action is.

The problem (or question) is whether the government knows you own those coins. 
If they do, you may just delay paying tax. There are other possibilities of course - for example the government may disappear - but I somehow think they'd sooner confiscate all of your BTC than disappear.

They're obviously not capable of much (even to make a proper agreement with signatures, dates, technical details or code seems too complicated for them), but since they created it on their own I'm asking why are they not executing it?

I suppose that depends on your definition of "successful". 
"Investor" types don't give a shit. Buy this, sell that, buy low, sell high... They couldn't care less if everything falls apart after they exit their trade.

Price goes up = excellent job by those overseeing Bitcoin code (never mind that Core isn't overseeing BarryCoin)
Price goes down = shit job
My hope is BTC drops to $200 so that all investor personas leave for altcoins. Unfortunately that's not likely so we'll have to be content with whatever drop in price we get.
The *purpose* of Bitcoin isn't to make you or anybody rich, but to allow us to conduct your economic and other affairs without *government* interference. For that, the price is irrelevant.

An additional 15% or so of miners by then would be enough.

1) BIP148 can't be added to anyone's platform because the BIP148 BTC don't exist (until Aug 1). 
2) Some exchanges already announced BIP148 support, others will. 
3) For a market to form, we don't need all exchanges to make BIP148 BTC tradeable. Just a few will do.

Technical improvements vs Bitcoin aren't a big deal. Don't forget 95% of those shitcoins are Bitcoin forks. Bitcoin is behind because it's huge and requires more care and prudence. We've also been dealing with the stalling by the big blockers which has delayed improvements for close to 1 year now.
The main and biggest problem is that Bitcoin decentralization is under threat by the miners and associated businesses. Everything else is minor details.
People should be aware of an attempt to regain control over Bitcoin, UASF BIP148. It's happening on August 1st.
If We the Users don't prevail, users will start leaving and that will be the beginning of the end. Watch UASF BIP148, ignore the rest.

@_date: 2017-07-17 12:41:31
Right. 
I meant to say in an attempt to avoid problematic splits, BTC1 aims to activate SegWit before Aug 1. It's not part of the NYA, but the agreement does say "immediately" (presumably as soon as BTC1 is out, to avoid issues if it fails to activate by August 1st). 
Because of that they seem to be sparing resources until Aug 1st. If SegWit doesn't activate by then, it's going to be a mess and it would mean the NYA failed.

there's already a ton of such posts today (i'm sure some more obvious ones have been reported and are gone by now) - i'm quite sure those who are losing money now get the idea. 
you could have posted or commented on this HODL stuff when BTC dipped to $2200 some 3 weeks ago and when the sub was flooded with HODL and BTFD messages. now that it's too late, what is the point? 
by the way, i don't see your entry in this [forecast competition](
just days ago i was [telling]( these clowns to sober up. [4 weeks ago]( i suggested to wait till late july. but they had to own it then, before it "breaks through $10,000 and never looks back."
to warn when everybody is buying may be useful, but to point our the obvious after a big crash isn't particularly useful. or are you saying you think btc will go much lower so it's not too late to sell? in that case i would say you weren't trolling (i did not report your post, i just stated my opinion of it)

1) If you transfer before Aug to paper wallet, you can sit it out (until he chains merge, for example)
2) 100% of your balance would "exist" on the both chains, but since you will be sitting it out, you don't really need to be aware of that - you just want to wait till they merge in the surviving chain.
If you want to "do things" with your BTC while the chains are split, then you should look into other options (there's a lot of existing examples and discussion on this in recent topics if you search this subreddit).
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:07:49


2MB is no different. Both larger blocks and new layers are necessary.  By blocking SW the malicious miner cabal also delays 2MB blocks and all other things that can be developed on SegWit. 
The rest is such a load of crap that I won't even comment on it.
But keep posting your "analysis", it doesn't matter. UASF BIP148, August 1st 2017, baby!
Edit: kudos for using the weird `i` thing in `Naive`. You do have some skills after all.
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:05:59


Basically yes, but with conditions. 
Prior to Aug 1 BIP148 and "current" BTC are the same. On Aug 1 they diverge and you can spend any (or both). If they merge after that, only one survives. After they split and before they merge, it's a trading opportunity (maybe). 
If you want to buy 1 BTC and trade with 2 BTC after the split, you should split your coin (similar to  to have the same BTC appear in 2 wallets (BIP148 and "old").
Or you could have 2 completely separate wallets, leave BTC in the first, and send some BTC to the BIP148 now, and then use them as BIP148 on Aug 1.


You can't buy now because now they're one and the same. On Aug 1 some exchanges will likely make it tradeable so you'll be able to buy BIP148 BTC with "old" BTC, for example.

I hope you didn't read this while showering (many other ideas seem to originate there) :-)
I think it's difficult to apply IBDD to make significant changes because the Bitcoin network must work based on the same rules (think of it as "basic human rights", for example). 
I think Layer 2 solutions or sidechains could use something similar to IBDD, where you take your BTC out and go elsewhere (to a place which has rules and features that suit you better).

Yes, you are fundafuckingmentally misunderstanding the both.
I'll try to make this as simple as possible:
1. UASF BIP148 doesn't **at all** rely on the number of nodes. 
2. UASF can win only if transactions move to its chain, and that's what we intend to do. 
It's user-activated and not node-activated for a reason.
Do you have any question?

Because you're asking as if that's something unexpected. 
The reason why it appears is the same across Core and UASF BIP148 (and probably BTC1 as well). 
Just like Core, UASF BIP148 doesn't consider that to be a problem that needs to be fixed, and hence doesn't fix it. 
Besides the internet is full of this Q&amp;A (including this subreddit - there's at least 5 posts like this every day recently).

`bitcoind -daemon -disablewallet -datadir=/wherever/you/want/your/blockchain`
If you intend to actually use Bitcoin Core as your wallet, it's OK to build it with wallet, but disable it at runtime as above.
If you have external wallet (e.g. Electrum), you can even build Bitcoin UASF without wallet (and not have to use `-disablewallet`). 
This is important because UASF BIP148 requires people to use it to transact (after Aug 1). Just running it won't matter after August 1st.
`-datadir=` is needed only if you don't want to use the default location (`$HOME/.bitcoin/`) which may be the case if you have external disk drive (much better).

It's a complex problem (I've read a few whitepapers about the economics of mining and mining pools) and it's hard to beat the pools. I wish there was a way to remove the incentive or ability to pool resources in mining. But a PoW would be needed for that.
If we (individuals) could break even on solo-mining and make a little with tumbling and similar activities, that would be great.

There's at least a 90% chance. Apart from Slushpool (which said they'll start signaling BIP91 today) all recent (50-60) blocks signaled BIP91, so we're now well over 80% and just need to keep this situation.

Yes, you're incorrect. 
Miners can set signaling bits as they please and if you look at what they've been signaling **after** lock-in, you'll see that some (eg. block 476794) still don't signal on bit 1.
They should soon (before it becomes mandatory) change and restart, but they can also ignore that and keep mining non-SW blocks to fuck everything up and make the network split in two chains.

BitFury - last time I looked it was like 3-4%. It seems they sold a lot of their hashpower to the highest bidder(s). 
SW2X needs to win a big chunk of economic majority by November 1st. With 25-40% of economic activity they can still be a big platform. 
Of course, with 50% or more of economic activity on SW2X, Core loses out. For Core supporters that would be a good opportunity to change the PoW since we'd have to fork anyway.

Because if you ultimately don't want end up using multi-MB base blocks (Nov 1, if you run SegWit2X aka BarryCoin), you will have to do something about it sooner or later.
If you are ambivalent towards base block sizes and the way SegWit2X does things, then it's OK to run Core now. Otherwise you need to do something else, either now with BIP148 code, or later, with some other code.

I see your logic now: the delay of developing SegWit cost us a lot in lost time, but the delay (almost just as long) of blocking its adoption **and** furthermore delaying work on development of 2MB block size - has not. 
Great reasoning. I'm convinced.
You should realize that your sincere efforts to showcase your ignorance don't matter at all.

But by owning just 0.1 BTC I'd have 6x more BTC than the average person (and that's only with 1 billion owners). If you're not too greedy or envious, having 10x more BTC than the average person can expect to have by 2020 may make you want to relax a bit...

How does the number of odds matter?

I wouldn't be surprised either, but that has nothing to do with the node count. It's to do with the expected amount of economic activity on the BIP148 BTC chain and the fact that the BIP148 chain can completely destroy the other chain.

@_date: 2017-07-04 11:06:15
They have no significant financial risks. I'm no expert in mining, but here's what I see:
* Risk of wallet theft 
* Risk of failed matching or settlement (one side doesn't deliver, other side gets charged, etc.)
I don't know how much business they do, but let's say (random figure) 100 BTC/day. If most people fund their wallets with 1 day of "fuel", they probably can lose up to 100 BTC. Fairly low risk operation, IMO. And if they want to steal your money, today is as good as tomorrow. And who wants to steal $300K these days? A shitty ICO can net you a lot more than that.
Now compare this with those cloud miner guys - you get $10 million in funds and need to quickly and flawlessly implement a *mid size engineering project*. You mess up one thing (say, data center cooling implementation gets delayed), you delay by 3-4 weeks and lose $1M or more. And the risks are many. But compared to Nicehash if you can muddle through (even while losing money) 1-2 initial projects, you can accumulate a lot of BTC in your wallet.

Goldification of Bitcoin is about to begin.... Thankfully what's different here is: while nobody knows how much gold is out there available for sale, here we do know how many BTC exist, so it will be harder but not impossible - we'll see just how corrupt those statist scumbags are - to sell more than one has. Because if you want to actually own what you buy, the operator has to settle (and probably do that from a public address, so that the holders can see what they're up to). However the State may allow them to not publish their holding addresses and thereby assist in manipulation. 
Regulation: only the regulated part will be ... regulated. The good thing about this is despite the "DLT" crooks such as IBM, R3 others, bitcoin is entering regulated finance. This is much better than, and very different from, regulators entering Bitcoin. Once institutional investors figure out bitcoin costs much less to hold and use, DLT crooks will lose out. 
Personally I don't give a shit whether this is good for the price of bitcoin (any price will do). I want to see fiat (and statist coins like this DLT crap by IBM and any future "fedcoin") destroyed.

That's exactly how freedom gets destroyed.
It's enough to have just 1 idiotic spending proposal out there in order to get a huge level of support for your own spending proposal, because once there are 2 proposals, democracy kicks in and if you don't support the second proposal, the first may win. 
(Maybe the second proposal was idiotic as well, but the point is they all may be idiotic or wasteful but some will get widespread support simply because they *seem* less bad compared to others.)
Now of course you're selfishly in favor of state spending on healthcare because that seems to be a nice way to push some of your own spending onto your fellow tax payers. 
I don't know how you expect anyone to support your unique idea, though. Yes, a state slave will want his welfare cost paid by others, a banister will want more gov spending and a weapons manufacturer will want a stronger country's role in the world aka foreign wars, etc. Predictable and deplorable.

Miners, exchanges and merchants don't make money from some unknown people running full nodes but from customers using *their own* platforms (i.e. outsourcing infrastructure services to them).

I don't feel the opposite. In fact I don't have an opinion on that - I don't care about BCC and have no plans to sell (or do anything at all) with "my" BCC. If it survives maybe I'll do it one day. Same as with BTC, I don't need the fiat I put in crypto and can afford to lose it all. It can remain parked in crypto, or vanish.

I've been too busy to do as much research as I'd like, but I think the meaning of "force" should be more precisely defined. 
If we generalize and talk about any PoW cryptocurrency, all miners install software they like and mine where they want. There's no obligation from any party, pool, user or "investor" to do anything. There's no (traditional) force or obligation involved.
Now this is where "monopoly control" of reference implementation comes in, but the source code is permissible and open so I am still not convinced that we can talk about coercive forks (regardless of who - UASFers, BarryCoiners, etc. - complains).
I haven't seen a good "theory of force in PoW networks" to be convinced on that (theory) level.

Nov 1 is when FrankenSegWit (BarryCoin, SW2X) is scheduled to hard forks (assuming their phase 1 deployment this month "activates"). 
By Nov 2 we'll know.  
Within 30 days we'll have 1 or more soft forks. Then on Nov 1 a hard fork (unless the BarryCoiners are fakin' it), so if you are a careful investor who decides to sit it out till Aug 2, you'll probably want to remain careful till Nov 2.

Right, but there's not much about the details on how they want to do it. I am under the impression they want to deliver these simultaneously *in one package/release*: let SW kick in first and lock a HF later, so that it becomes impossible (without a HF) to back out of the 2MB HF.

Is anybody asking for that? 
It wouldn't make any sense for any UASF supporter to not have access to the legacy BTC chain either. 
UASF BIP148 supporters need and want to be able to trade and use the both (one of them to get rid of our legacy BTC).
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:47:06


Are "they" the site that tracks them? That's something they could answer (they likely try to interact with those nodes in a more advanced way than just connect to them), but for example if you're v0.12 and "signal" BIP148, it's fake unless you back-ported BIP148 (and all SegWit-related code) to v0.12 - highly unlikely. 
Spoofing isn't a threat, it's just useless. For example if you signal BIP148 and your node can't actually understand SegWit transactions, then if BIP148 wins over BarryCoin you will find yourself forked on a wrong chain, just like BarryCoin clients.
You can only hurt yourself with "fake" signaling. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 17:32:07

It's not messy - BIP148 is a safer bet, but BTC1 and UASF BIP148 are supposed to behave the same (for all practical purposes) all the way until Nov 1.

I understand many are into Bitcoin because it's been a fairly easy way to make some (tax free) income. But that's their own problem.

Because he's got too much money to throw around. They make $1 million in tx fees per day. Why not spend $10-20K to "help" shape the narrative?
His ROI on these particular moves is probably nothing, but he basically attempts to create "fake news" - people who watch BIP148 stats may now begin to dismiss them as unreliable or fake (as in "fake status by UASF supporters", which is exactly what you're suspecting).
Any UASF supporter knows the node count doesn't matter except that it helps us track how we're doing in terms of reach-out. 
Why would we waste time on such nonsense?


They are obligated to support it or risk lawsuits in any case.
If on August 1 you receive a payment to your legacy BTC chain and UASF wins, that chain will get reorg'ed and your payment will vanish.
The chance of that happening is small, but is it smaller than 5%? 
I think it's much larger, but let's say it's 5%. If you receive $10 mil in incoming transactions per day, that's roughly $500,000 / hour, so an exchange can easily lose $1 million if 2 hours of in-flight transactions get reorg'ed. 
If you're a large exchange you can easily make your customers lose many millions of dollars and the cost to mitigate it is what - $10K to setup a BIP148 wallet and support the both chains?


Thanks for saying this. The way I see it is "if BIP148 doesn't make it, that is very negative for the value of Bitcoin". 
The real issue - in my mind - is not that UASF would fail, but that after that there would be nothing to prevent Bitmain from further strengthening their grip on Bitcoin.
You can see that they're buying traffic (fucking pathetic - what's this, 1999?) by investing peanuts in "useful idiot" companies to be able to survive BIP148.

Of course we should just SegWit - that decision has been made by Bitcoin users.
Google `UASF BIP148 binaries` to get the warez (or find links to the source) and get ready for UASF on August 1st.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:02:08
Only to estimate the effectiveness of our outreach. sgbett explained above what really matters. No one in the UASF community thinks otherwise.
Nodes with fake `uacomment`s may (if MASF148 doesn't happen by Aug 1, for example, or if they want to send/receive on the right chain immediately after they split after Aug 1) ultimately have to install BIP148 software, but currently that's not required. Their `uacomment` just tells us they got the message.

Yes, tiny tx are commonly considered spam and are by default rejected (if tx size is below 5430 satoshi). You don't see those in mempool stats.
My point is these posts about "spam" are quite arbitrary and usually they're combined with anti-Ver rhetoric and such. There's been no deep analysis as to who is making those and why, so now that the whole SW drama is about to be over it's tiresome to read these speculations again. I also dislike Ver for his anti-BTC campaign, but these posts about "Ver spam" have become spam of their own.
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:27:16
That depends on many factors. 
People who bought at $245 likely wouldn't do anything. Others may panic to fiat, traders may speculate and buy some other coin, etc.
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:04:55
Depends on where you transact. If you transact on the main chain it will take longer as the effect of the SegWit offload fades, but if we succeed to kick the miner cabal's but (UASF BIP148, on Aug 1) for a while it will be like in the old days (2-3 years ago).
If you send/receive off-chain, it will be very fast - basically time won't depend on the blockchain, but you'd have to have an open channel with the LN hub so you'll likely use this for regular small transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:28:58

I see it slightly differently (the comparison, not the conclusion) - last year the citizens wanted to pool resources for defense but their representatives have been telling them there was no risk of war.
Now that we're under attack, they (Core) are telling us we should negotiate a semi-surrender because there's no time to organize defense. 
Core should present their view of solution within 1-2 weeks. Their approach isn't sustainable.

If Easy money is in UASF then he'll (finally) lose once.
But he's made a shitload of money with his stalling and other tactics so I don't see him applying for food stamps anytime soon.
Money isn't the root of all evil. It's a good tool that enables people to trade and store value. Without it you give that power to commissars. To understand how they defeat evil, look at North Korea, Venezuela or the EU.
The problem with this situation (where people like Jihan come out on top) is that we helped him create this situation. Instead of UASF-ing the fuck of all Jihans as soon as they appear, we've allowed them to proliferate and prosper.

@_date: 2017-05-27 13:36:42
BU (Bitmain, Ver and others) will certainly try to dump as many BIP148 BTC and buy as many "legacy" BTC after the split, but if a majority of transaction goes to the UASF chain, miners should simply follow. 
As a miner you can't make much revenue if all you mine is empty blocks. Don't forget that at the beginning everyone will have their BTC doubled (1x on the legacy, and 1x on the BIP148 chain). 
If Wu, Ver et al. buy a ton of legacy coins and economic activity on the BIP148 chain is more, why wouldn't the undecided miners use that chance to sell their legacy BTC for fiat and go mine the UASF chain? 
In the end what matters is where the users go. Trading on outcomes is just a derivative of that - some people will also enter various trades to lever up, some won't. But economic activity of the users on each chain is the key factor.
@_date: 2015-10-02 06:18:49


That statement is completely ridiculous and was debunked from many angles which I don't want to repeat here.
But one of many things that could be said about it is: just one of the CB's, the Fed, spends more of *other people's* money in order to *steal* from its users. How's that for wasteful?
@_date: 2017-07-31 10:36:49
They (the gov) can't use it internally, so they auction it off just like they auction other confiscated stuff that's not illegal. Drugs get destroyed, but other stuff gets sold at auctions. 
So yes, it is discouraged because if you own it, you're a suspect and like BTC-e customers you can lose access to it just because.

It's **Voluntarists vs. Statists and Crony Capitalists**
Some BarryCoiners may (claim to) be libertarians, but their actions are actions of crony capitalists. Example: if you run a cryptoexchange that stands to benefit from centralization (which is what SegWit2X is likely to bring about), you most definitively are a crony capitalist. I wrote about the crony exchanges in [Crypto Exchanges are Centralized Man's Payment Channels](
Some others may be quasi-libertarian, but they'll willingly trade a pound of liberty for a walletful of Bitcoins. To that I say: only over my forked Bitcoin.

That's actually untrue. You only control the private key(s), but your UTXO's ("BTC") are never in your possession - they're replicated all over the world. That's a huge difference between cryptocurrencies and physical items.


Wealthy people don't need to compile UASF BIP148, run full nodes, send emails to crypto-exchanges and fight BarryCoin trolls in order to hang onto their wealth. 
Both BTC and gold are good to down. Each has its advantages. It's not one or the other.
@_date: 2017-07-10 12:32:42
It **is** an important metric, which is why they won't let you know the answer :-)
My personal belief is effectively they influence &gt;50%. That is, they don't own more than one half, but they can press other pools to do what they want (such as not signal BIP141 support)
@_date: 2017-07-20 03:52:14
Hmm, after more than a year of nothing happening and no solution on the horizon, that seemed appropriate to me (especially since the other alternative was to urgently do the other thing, namely increase the block size).
Now there's a chance we may end up with the both (SW + larger block size) but at least larger blocks would be delayed by a quarter.

Depending on the initial agreement to use their service, they may or may not have that responsibility. If their EULA said they'll sell customer data and you accepted, then they'd have the right. 
But if they said they'd protect your data, they have the responsibility to remove it regardless and you could sue them in private court. The EU is irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-07-15 05:29:49
Most comments (even by BarryCoiners) say that forking should be embraced (I'd even say encouraged). 
At least we agree on something. 
As a UASFer I will also never run a 2X client and I'd like 2X to turn out to be reasonably successful so that we can fork Bitcoin and use this opportunity to decentralize mining. 
The parallel with global warming was poorly chosen. I won't rant about that now, but in economic terms it's a completely different situation from what we're dealing with in Bitcoin right now.

Yesterday Slushpool said they'll start signaling BIP91 today, so some had decided to try that. 
But the NYA participants (83%) aren't delivering on their end, so if their sabotage is deliberate they can cut more to keep the signaling hashpower below 80% as they're doing now.
And another problem is that some who are actually signaling BIP91 may not be using BTC1 software, so maybe it's better if SW2X failed.

I'll comment one more time. The fact that the miners created this agreement with each other and business shows what they think of Bitcoin users (and Core devs). It's illusory to expect that kind of people to do the right thing. 
The good thing is there's BIP148 so we don't have to count on those fuckers. SegWit will happen with or without them.
Next time they try to play tricks on the users, the baseline solution should be to change the PoW.
Only one group of people in this conflict has fixed, highly specialized assets that cannot be easily deployed elsewhere.

There's no "community", by the way. It's just a URL (:-)

Well, that's why I had "**or** invest in some business" in there, which you unnecessarily amputated to make a point.
Risk should be a non-issue for people who choose to invest in bitcoin - it's a hail Mary anyway. Throw a single digit percentage of net worth in it and forget about it for 5 years. 
Not that I care what people do with their money... Just saying.
While I'm at it: I have some money in crypto but I'm not rich. If I had a lot of money I wouldn't invest it to get more money (this approach seems completely ludicrous to me, yet many rich people do it) - I'd invest/spend it to make products and services that don't yet exist. I think Wonz and Paul Allen are good examples of that.

Why would I accept a less stifling approach when I don't have to accept any approach (the least stifling approach for me personally)? 
Or when I can accept any approach among *many* that the community, groups and organizations will develop on their own?
"The" least stifling approach may cost me more (regulatory overhead), remove my privacy (if you don't know the identity of the other party/parties you can't sue them) and impose various rules &amp; regulations that I don't find appropriate for my needs. 
If someone wants to be bound by any particular set of rules, it's their choice. I see negative value in anything done by the government and can say with absolute certainty that I will not work by their rules whatever they turn out to be.

I would tend to agree with the OP - the explosive rise in price is similar to the last all time high few years ago (actually the curve looks similar too). 
Could it be different this time? Maybe, but I doubt that. 
Those new to BTC shouldn't go crazy and all in, but that's what many are doing now. I think a warning is in order.
Long term hodlers don't need to care about this because BTC can drop 50% and they'll still be fine. Newbies won't.
As to your safe-haven investment claim, it's partially true. That's one of reasons why I hodl, but I have to run a UASF node in order to ensure that my BTC savings don't get destroyed by the BU lunatics, there are different levels of "safe".

Because with on-chain you get the best speed &amp; security. If you're sending or receiving 100 BTC, why would you want to use LN or SW?
Off-chain tx have to be check-pointed to the blockchain, so (for example - I'm making shit up as there are many "it depends") if the number of bitcoin transactions goes up by a factor of 3 and 75% of those are SegWit transactions, we'd still hit the 1MB limit. 
There's a lot more tx out there (say, IoT) than even LN can process, so the potential number of transactions that can use Bitcoin (on- or off-chain) is practically unlimited.

If an exchange doesn't intend to support BCC then those who want to control unspent outputs on the hated clone blockchain from day 1 can simply fix the problem by switching to another exchange *or* withdrawing BTC to their own wallet. 
Here on this sub we have folks who are against BCC and they don't want to see it listed by popular exchanges, and on the other we have people who demand that even such exchanges accommodate "BCC wallet cloning". And what's very funny, some people are in favor of the both.

I also don't see a problem, first and foremost because they have the right to do it *and* don't need to ask us for a permission or opinion, so it doesn't matter what we here think about their plans.
Second, certain schizophrenics in our community claim to support permissionless innovation, open source and freedom, but seek to pressure, shame or otherwise impact others' right to exercise it.
To commenters who complain how this screws our ways of using BTC. Yes, I agree it does. Partially it's because BCC has shitty devs, and another reason is they don't care (some may even be malicious). But if it's so easy to screw with BTC maybe we need to fix this in our own code and adopt better practices. 
tl:dr: these complaints are pathetic. It sounds to me many Bitcoiners have no resilience and lack the ability to handle non-trivial challenges. Apparently all it takes to destroy BTC is that couple of governments or even small organized groups clone BTC the way BCC did and we'd be fucked. Sad!

Which part of my comment indicates I don't understand that? 
That's precisely why the UASF supporters are organizing BIP148.
If Bitmain prevails it all goes to shit.


Soft forks have been successfully implemented before. And again, the whole point of doing it is to let the malicious miners (as well as others; IMO this includes Core) know that we'll UASF whenever core principles of the network are under threat.
From Coindesk: 
*Past examples of successful soft forks include software upgrades like BIP 66 (which dealt with signature validation) and P2SH (which altered bitcoin's address formatting).*
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:54:26
UASF BIP148 will likely be chaotic, even if for a short while, so I doubt it will make the price go up on its own. 
If the price recovers then BIP148 won't matter; if it doesn't, it won't help.

The idea is to keep them.
Recent events have shown many disagree with users what Bitcoin is and how is should be governed.
The problem is how to keep the right 33% (which recently was signaling BIP141) when everyone is using (more or less) the same mining equipment? If problems get worse we can let the malicious ones take over, or change the PoW and leave behind the cooperating miners.
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:23:49
Oops, you're right - I mistyped that.
I wanted to say BIP141 is 40 plus percent ( - 43.1% in the last 2016 blocks at the moment).
The other (NYA) guys are just showing their intention to signal, but they haven't done anything yet.
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:11:57
If you have a newer version it can seed more because of SW-related stuff. I often lose incoming connections because of issues with my ISP. 
When incoming connections are busy it can go up to 2 MB/s. It depends who connects to me and why. If I get connections from new nodes who need to download the blockchain and I'm one of their better connections, it gets busy. My h/w is slow so I don't connect to many peers. With your number of connections you probably have a few such peers at all times.

I still don't like the explanation that in SF rules get stricter. It's correct, but counterintuitive and the latter is important because when someone asks, it's because they don't understand.

Trezor supports BIP148 so if chains split you'll be able to access your BTC on the both chains. As the comment below says to use either you'd first have to "split" them to avoid risks. If no split happens, you won't have to do anything.

A small number of important nodes would have to "pull" a number of important mining pools with them, in order to not get crushed by the Jihanists (you probably recall that Jihan said he'd mess with BIP148 chain).
Some (yesterday I've had a discussion in another post here) say users should wait to see if BIP148 is likely to succeed before they switch. That's ludicrous. I don't *have to* use Bitcoin and I don't care which side is more likely to win. For me it's BIP148 or nothing.

I'd say "use SegWit on that" because on UASF it would be activated (assuming that lunatic Jihan doesn't attack BIP148 and make it a SW-less chain). 
(That is clear in the text - only the title is slightly unclear.)
If the Jihanists pull the rug from under SW2, it seems the safest option for BarryCoiners would be to fall back to Core and let Jihan attack BIP148 chain, rather than move to BIP148.
Who the hell knows, there are too many variables...
@_date: 2017-07-05 16:33:08
There's 7000 public nodes out there. There's probably 30K (wild guess) Bitcoin Core nodes which *contain* wallet functionality. Any one of those users who simply decides to remove Bitcoin Core and install Bitcoin Core SegWit UASF or Bitcoin Knots **does not** need to figure out anything. They will have a functioning BIP148 wallet.
Electrum or other wallets that make use of full nodes require no special skills either. The only difference is you install Bitcoin Core from another source (UASF or Luke's Knots).

That would be a nice way to stimulate the economy.
I mean those idiots have done the same for Wall Street, maybe they could consider the ordinary man...
If they wanted to control Bitcoin it would be cheaper to buy 70-80% of hash power and mess up the blockchain but there are other coins so it's not a viable strategy against cryptocurencies in general.
Actually to some extent cryptocurencies (once they "regulate" them) are beneficial to those crooks because they create the appearance of a cashless society which makes their War on Cash less obvious.
Bottom line: whatever happens, resist the government any way you can because by definition they're up to no good.

Well, that's not really true. There are exchanges that support but I don't know what your definition of "major" is.
Among the big ones, Bitfinex will have BIP148 support (we don't know yet to what extent, maybe just some contracts).


It's going to be more difficult if they don't. 
One issue is they (exchanges) tell people they'll support UASF BIP148 if necessary and users don't know what to say next. 
The thing is if you're let's say on Polo and it's August 1 3:00am UTC and you want to do something with your coins on the BIP148 chain, you're fucked. Or if you receive a payment on the legacy chain and 6 hours later that chain gets wiped out what is Polo going to do for you.

Read about it elsewhere in detail, but because SW blocks contain a lot of transactions their validation takes more miner resources than the same number of on-chain transactions. However, the price (tx fee) that miners collect is proportionately lower, so they make relatively less money validating those. They (the miners) complain Core decided the ratio of on-block vs. off block transactions in an arbitrary manner. I think that makes some sense, although I haven't tried to deep dive into this.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:13:27
Yeah but that kind of variance isn't of interest now. 
We're interested in mining pool share vs. block-mined-by variance.
What's the likelihood three 3 non-SW2X signaling miners (with a less than 10% share) will mine 50% of blocks remaining in this activation period? Until 3 hours ago math geniuses on this sub were telling me it's over 60%. LOL...

That's true. 
On the other hand it wouldn't be really felt* as it'd "only" increase the public debt (it's been a while since the US government tried to balance its spending with added taxation) so I figure the embarrassment would be worth the added public debt.

@_date: 2017-05-28 13:37:48
I don't think anyone would be stuck. 
BIP148-friendly miners will reject those blocks altogether. 
From the moment of soft-fork activation, the BIP148 chain would *only* have new blocks created *only* by SW-signaling miners.
In your example, let's say there's a new SW signaling miner C.
C would be building on the last block created before midnight (when BIP148 was activated).
Then B could say "screw it, I'm going over" and continue mining on top of C's block, for example.

@_date: 2017-05-04 17:05:59
That's great. 
I think at least the authors won't mind to open/close channels once per month. 
Many readers won't care to do it more frequently than that. 
Maybe Yours could create more ways to spend BTC (for example, let authors review/edit other authors article for a  fee) so that people have more reason to fund their channels with larger (not huge, but say $20 in BTC) and keep them open longer.
I hope Yours takes off and bitcoin micropayments with it.

I don't understand why people don't simply link to the fucking source (uasf.saltylemon.org) - it's always these bullshit image services (or images stored in Reddit cache) instead of the source.

Because, as the top Google search result for `bitcoin trademark` says:
It is a generic term like the terms used for other currencies such as “dollar”, “euro,” “yen,” etc,” it had stated. “The Foundation is committed to doing what it can to protect the term “BITCOIN” for public use.”
Any other questions?

1) They have the right to do that
2) You can actually sell your BCC (if you're interested check their own sub)
3) Everyone is "screwing with the value of BTC" - LTC, ETH, USD, you name it. It's a free market (LTC, ETH). USD is different. BCC is not like USD.
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:12:17
It's already locked in (indirectly, via SegWit2X). 
SegWit2X miners *could* choose to not activate it, but that's quite unlikely. If you want to see when, search for SW2X activation block height.

There are many other possible reasons. Such as incompetence.

When a contract is made, it includes means of payment, so if you want BTC148 and the buyer has no BTC148 he can refuse to buy (or ask to pay with something else, etc.).
A tricky part for the seller (which includes the tyrannical and user-hostile Tier 1 and Tier 2 crypto-exchanges) is if you *don't* indicate which specific chain or "variant" of BTC you're denominating in, there can be a misunderstanding (and worse).

**Wrong.**

Nobody who googles "bip148" needs help with binaries. 
Regarding number 2: we know. The site maintainer is doing a poor job keeping the site up to date. (The correct place to provide feedback or complain is Github, as indicated at the bottom of each page)


It's easy to find and at the obvious place: 
Also if you search this subreddit, it's very easy to find 10-20 results. 
We need to get better ranking for "bitcoin uasf", although "bip148" is also useful.

I completely agree on the shit metric. They're worried because people are leaving fiat and thereby make them lose their control of the recovery and other bullshit narratives (such as that Central Banks are helpful and do something a 3 person ICO project doesn't/can't).
50 billion isn't a lot, but it is special. Once people are in, they discover a whole new world that many have not thought possible and begin to reach certain conclusions none of which are favorable to People of The Economist.

I mean this:
* The split will occur on Aug 1
* You want to send/receive on Aug 1
* Polo (for example) won't let you, so you create (for example) 2 Virtual Machines with a full Bitcoin Core node in each VM; one would be Bitcoin Core UASF BIP148 and the other would be stock/legacy Bitcoin Core
* You create a wallet on each
* Now you withdraw BTC from Poloniex to your wallet and split the coins. Let's say that's 0.5 BTC.
* You'd have 0.5 BTC in each wallet. On Aug 1, you can spend and receive from the both wallets and they may diverge. The side of the chain that loses out will have its tx reverted.
On Aug 1 you could send your 0.5 "legacy" BTC back to Polo and sell them (sending them to Polo before Aug 1 wouldn't work because until Aug 1 your BIP148 full node would end up with an empty wallet - since the addresses are the same and fork hasn't happened yet, they'd move in sync until August 1).
Even if the legacy side (the only option on Polo) wins, there's no reason to think BTC would become significantly more expensive

If they are simply selling to whoever pays more, they wouldn't need to *knowingly* sell to Bitmain. They could sell to a Bitmain company called Shitmain and not know about it. I don't want to speculate on why someone buys or not.

Jihan &amp; Co have amassed a fair amount of hashpower for the coming softfork battle ( so his commitment is credible.


Yes and as you mentioned another problem is because the situation is so fluid, you never know how new events might be interpreted by Aug 1, so all these counterparty and environment risks make it hard to make a market or bet with reasonable spread. IMO if SegWit takes effect by October, it will have happened only because of BIP148 but most pre-NYA bets won't recognize that.

I don't know. Maybe a fork with a different PoW, if that becomes an option?

Bitcoin legitimization comes from users, not governments.

Therefore even though 80% of miners *currently* support BIP91, by Nov 1 that may be 37%, so if the 37% of miners want to fork off, they could fork off...

Fucking insanity. 
Bitcoin is a voluntarist currency. Some quasi-libertarians (and other quasi free market types) involved in Bitcoin **business** end up with worrying more about their stawk options and in the process completely lose sight of why Bitcoin was created and why it exists.

@_date: 2017-07-06 00:39:25
The moment you can't freely (without meaningful restrictions) buy and sell it, it becomes not fiat, but less worth until it one day becomes worthless. The only measure of Bitcoin's value is the ability to use it in a permission-less way. If you can't, it's as useless as shit.
@_date: 2017-07-20 03:56:48
If you're connected then you're connected. 
There's nothing to check except that you didn't click on non-BIP148 bitcoin-qt.exe (which is why you should remove other versions if you have them).
The obsession with "checking" and "connections" doesn't help anyone. And also, folks: UASF BIP148 doesn't work differently to Core.
**If** there's a problem (eg the network partitions) you'll read about it in the news because you won't be the only person having a problem with "connections".

@_date: 2017-07-06 01:33:35
1) SW2X includes anti-features in their release
2) SW2X demands from Core to provide links to SW2X downloads or uses it's BarryCoin Referral Network to trick enough users into "upgrading" to BTC1 
3) Next round of anti-features gets implemented without even trying to get it reviewed or included in Core (well, that wouldn't be that dissimilar from this round)
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:35:22
To be fair to the shitcoiners from SW2X, it's a miner-targeted release. 
MaxTG [says]( those are a mistake. 
I disagree - you want to have a synced up node for later and maybe check whether it works properly as a gateway node. 
But... SW2X is still a crappy piece of software released by a crappily governed dev team. 
If you want a proper SegWit compatible full node, run UASF BIP148.

USDT issuer isn't obliged to act as market maker (that is, to buy at the face value).

@_date: 2017-07-04 10:47:55


And vice versa (that is, BIP148 doomsayers could make an offer to sell BIP148). In recent weeks we've asked some folks here to make an offer and none would (make an offer to sell BIP148 BTC at a price that corresponds to their prognostications).
A problem (for which I have no solution that can work on this sub) related to your suggestion is that it's hard to prove that someone sold non-BIP148 coins and didn't buy them in another transaction. We really need a market where people can state their opinions by making buy and sell offers, but most exchanges have done an extremely crappy job and no meaningful markets exist.

A topic on this was created yesterday.
This is most likely Bitmain's version of 50 Sats Army (see  trying to mess with UASF (somebody should tell them we've *always* be saying the node count is irrelevant, but even when we put this in our comments that simply doesn't seem to compute).
But what else can they do on a Sunday like this?
The scaling agreement ( has been successfully concluded (signatures pending), their work on 2MB hard fork code is done and they're making $1 million bucks in tx fees per day so after all that hard work they deserve to have some fun!
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:41:04
It's not a misnomer, but if you think it is, that's fine by me.
In reality you can be a user on your own soft-forked chain (new rules, no new blocks yet), without any miners mining your chain. Clearly that chain wouldn't be very useful, but users start it.
Then miners decide to join (and mine) or not.


There's also MASF BIP148 so that one is taken. 
This one requires the miners even more than a UASF.


You can see segwit.co and other stats. Approximately 1/3 of the miners are signaling for SegWit, some are fence-sitting and some are against (the Bitmain Cabal). 
The SegWit-signaling third could decide mine on the user chain, if they decided there was enough activity on the BIP148 chain (which would mean the BIP148 BTC have value). Also some other miners who now have to compete against the Bitmain Cabal's ASICBOOST miners which exploit a known vulnerability in the Bitcoin mining algo to gain unfair economic advantage.

It dropped to $1,700-1,800 (depending on the exchange - I heard it was $1,525 on Polo) and went back to $2,200. 
So if you had bought 1 BTC for $2,700, sold in panic at $2,300 (-$400) and then bought at $1,700 and waited to $2,200, you'd be in the green.
The numbers don't work out for all exchanges and situations, obviously. For example on my exchange the prices never went *really* down and even now they're higher than "global average", but the peak was much higher as well, so who panicked, sold and bought again would have no paper loss at this moment.

1) Reasonable point. If someone clones an open source, permissionless protocol and there's 2 "entities" using it in such a way that they can interfere with each other, how do we determine that one is encroaching upon the rights of the other? 
And if they have no right to run BCC, shouldn't we be unable to claim the right to use the same BCC? It seems contradictory to say BCC is unlawful and at the same time use that protocol!
2) If you withdraw and don't receive your coins, it's the exchange's fault and they should compensate you. The BTC would be stolen from them, not from you. (As an aside, the ability to screw around with BTC like this seems like a security issue to me.)

Whales just trade like most of us do, they only have more money to play with. To you and me it doesn't make any difference if 100 traders make 1 order each, of 1 whale places 100 small orders. The issue is that this kind of club-based decision making creates whales.

As someone earlier commented, you at least have a better store of value. If few months ago you had 100 V-Coins and bought 0.001 BTC with that, now you have 200 V-Coins (in BTC) and can likely buy the same or larger amount of goods that you could with 100 V-Coins.
You don't actually need to use BTC for anything. It's enough to buy and sit tight. 
Of course they could achieve something similar by buying USD (at least for now) but it's hard to buy it in Venezuela.

I know that question, but to be honest I'm not that interested in the answer (because I haven't considered using Nicehash to mine BTC; I am considering to use it to mine BIP148 BTC and for this use case the ROI hasn't been a primary consideration). 
Btw, there have been proposals to create "large fee" transactions on the BIP148 to reward miners, which is really the same thing - if you want to contribute you can spend a bit via large fee transactions, or via hashpower leasing (assuming it's not profitable). The first is easier for less technical people, the second is more interesting for geeks.
Maybe you could create a dedicated OP to find out?

The question was whether the current state ensures he's got a fully functioning BIP148 node and the answer is yes.
There's no need for ordinary users to open firewall ports (or enable UPnP) and chase some stupid "optimal" connection number. If you think the default number of connections is suboptimal, submit a bug to Core repo.

I looked into this a while (2 years?) ago and found several experiments (no Bloom filters IIRC), already abandoned at the time, to store blocks in Hadoop, NOSQL and so on. I think you can still find some of those on the Web and even Github (the source and all). 
With ZMQ it's now probably much easier to build such solutions and use Big Data approaches to "stream" blocks on demand. That could make SVP with large blockchain sizes quite efficient I/O wise. 
Right now there's a plain `addrindex` implementation of Bitcoin Core 0.13 by BTCDrak (on Github) based on old patches by JM Corgan. It obviously uses a similar approach to `txindex` and likely wouldn't scale to insane blockchain sizes. btcd also allows `addrindex`.

You can *also* do offline transactions of course. You prepare a 2-2 multisig address and sign it once in some other place and once offline with Electrum. 
*Offline copies of Electrum will not show the addresses at all because it cannot synchronize with the network. You can force an offline generation of a few addresses by typing the following into the Console: wallet.synchronize(). When it’s complete, restart Electrum and your addresses will once again be available.*

It's like progressive government policies. We all want the sick to get (free) help, but resources are limited. Imagine if tx fees were 1% of what they're today. There would still be (probably more) unconfirmed transactions. You can't moderate consumption of a useful limited resource without raising prices (or limiting its availability).
Bitcoin Core folks have been often criticized for praising higher tx fees, but what other way is there for the miners to pay for their equipment and operating expenses (now that we have more transactions and constantly lower and lower mining rewards)?
Ideally we'll have a nice balance between tx throughput and cost, but no one knows what that is. Is it 10tps and 200 satoshi per KB of tx or something else? 
We have to let a market develop. As much as I hate to see user complaints about the cost and worsening confirmation times, I know that growing fees will eventually make it easier for gather investment funds for a new mining chip designer. Miner decentralization has failed and higher fees may help us fix that problem.

Yes, better chips wouldn't solve tx/s, I mean they would help fix the problem with the Bitcoin Fed (Bitmain). 
And yes, it appears the demand is greatly outstripping the supply, which is why it may be a good time for a new investor to jump in and create another chip design company. 
The supply can be improved first by SW and secondly with bigger blocks. SW already has 7 (just saw that article here) successful deployments. Bigger blocks and other approaches can follow after that. I'm a UASF supporter and have absolutely no issues with larger blocks, as soon as they're investigated and tested properly.

@_date: 2017-05-29 23:36:07
Why? 
If UASF is "guaranteed" to fail, 10 mins into the split "legacy" BTC should be worth almost 1:1 so I can exit with barely any loss. 
At the same time UASF BIP148 BTC should be 1 cent on the dollar so to speak. I can't see why I would lose more than few percent (if I choose this strategy). I can sell some BTC before, and part after (after they become "legacy") and tune my "loss" to suit my risk profile. 
I am more than willing to lose some money in order to achieve a successful UASF but many can use BIP148 coins without losing any money (if they leave their legacy BTC idle in a split coin wallet).
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:32:44
Yeah the loan part isn't a good idea.

1) It's very simple - if you get paid in BTC and if it drops 10% before you spend it or convert it into fiat, in almost any developed country you still get **more** than what you'd get if you got paid in fiat and consequently taxed. 
2) Fiat has absolutely no backing yet 1,750 units of one of them (the US dollar) can somehow buy 1 BTC. There are all sorts of surprising phenomena once you begin to think about these things.
3) Yes. Which is why changes are carefully evaluated, made on testnet first, tested for a while and only then introduced on mainnet. Sometimes it also requires voting. 
These questions and answers are priced into the current price because they've been known for quite a while.

Schiff is losing some of the anti-Fed money to cryptocurrencies and some of people who think crypto is a better choice than gold are one of reasons why he often talks about Bitcoin. 
But Schiff isn't completely wrong. Those who think Bitcoin will hold value even if Bitmain takes control of it are more wrong than Schiff. 
Another example (of where Schiff is right) is that if you want to store value in precious metals you don't have to be active (you can simply hang onto it just like you hang onto your private key(s)) and there's nothing some guy from Bitmain can do to remotely destroy it.

It wouldn't stay on that level long - the situation would likely resolve itself within days. 
Slower block times would be a temporary inconvenience. It probably won't be noticeable in terms of transaction times (vs. now in this congested situation) for low tx fee transactions. Now it takes 3-4 hours, then it may also take 3-4 hours.

Oh, I see.
I said they should allow choices, so I agree with you they shouldn't support only one chain. 
But also as I said, I disagree that if they provide options, the BIP148 chain won't work. It will work very well.
Currently the problem isn't that there are exchanges that plan to support only BIP148. The problem is there are no exchanges that plan to create and support multiple BTC tokens (or change to only BIP148 - that's certainly an option for some exchanges). With that they actually create additional risks for their customers, as Luke explained in the post about risks of BIP148 UASF for users.

On Aug 1 if you use chain A to pay a guy on chain B, what happens to your payment? Or if guy who uses chain A sends BTC to your address but Coinbase wallet only lets you use chain B, what then?

@_date: 2017-06-14 13:15:16
Quick background:
* UASF BIP148, a **simple soft-fork** that **doesn't require upgrade by any client** out there, was announced **close to 3 months** before activation date.
* BarryCoin (FrankenSegWit), a **complex soft-hard fork bundle** was announced just **2 months** before activation date. 
To protect the network, Core they declined to include a BIP148 option (not enough time - some *miners* could be left behind).
Now if BarryCoin prevails the entire Bitcoin network (miners and users) will be given **less** time to perform a **mandatory** upgrade to a **riskier** piece of software. 
`-bip148` should be added to 0.14.2 with default to ON (`1`).
@_date: 2017-07-17 03:56:16
If your node is UASF BIP148 it will simply reject blocks from non-SegWit-signaling miners starting Aug 1
You don't signal anything. Your node by default enforces BIP148 (you can disable that to revert to Core-like behavior).

It's not "just". Even proposals aren't ready, let alone the code and testing. 
In terms of coding, you can look at the FrankenSegWit (as they're popularly called) patches, which is the latest &amp; greatest attempt endorsed by Bitmain on Github and it's a mess. 
Spoonet is the best researched (according to Core developers and many others) approach to 2MB blocks, but for some reason Bitmain doesn't like it.


Have you ever saved a TB file (block)? Try it, it's fun.
With 8MB I probably won't be able to run a full node, which means I'll be 100% dependent on someone like Bitmain &amp; Friends to tell me what's going on on the network. I don't like that.

About 40 plus percent are signaling BIP148 and there's a whole bunch of NYA miners intentioning (their future support for BIP91)
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:08:38


i said over 90% of blocks from 60 or so blocks mined until the time i was commenting were signaling BIP91. 


if at the time i was commenting we had 79% in favor of BIP91 and out of the previous (prior to my comment) 60 blocks were &gt; 90% in favor of BIP91 (so, well over 90% in favor), how could we possibly not have more than 80% by the end of this voting period? 
i just looked: out of 100 recent blocks (476600 to 476700), only 3 were **not** signaling BIP91, which is 97% in favor. how the fuck can I start with a 79% "in favor", and a bit later than half-way through the voting period raise my "in favor" percentage to 97% and still not make the average &gt; 80%?

SegWit was released by Core when BTC was 10-20% of today's price, it's nothing to do with price but with miner "voting" and adoption.
It solves real problems, many of which have nothing to do with fees and network congestion.


That's not a relevant question. Core doesn't control when SegWit gets adopted or not. People researched and coded it a long time ago and released in October 2016. When/if gets adopted is up to miners (and users). It's not like any of these groups will now change their mind because of your suggestion.

Where did I say Core will allow UASF?
I simply said that based on the current situation, on Aug 1 these two and UASF BIP148 will coexist on the same chain. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:09:43
Core used to say there's not enough support (for example now only about 1,000 out of 7,000 public nodes run UASF BIP148) and that there's a risk of chain split (if the miners were to not follow BIP148 chain).
Of course there's been less support than we'd like to have, but that's because UASF is a group without funding and with modest, volunteer resources so it's been rather hard to get the message out and have people get the software (this subreddit doesn't allow the posting of links to releases that break compatibility with Core). 
The proposal to merge UASF BIP148 support was very reasonable - it consisted of a patch that enabled activation of BIP148 and was OFF by default. With that built into Core we'd probably get to 4-5,000 nodes by August 1, but since Core refused to merge it we will hopefully reach at least 2-3,000.

It seems most people here are too weak to stand up for anything. They import their lethargy from the fiat world and follow the old recipe of "Don't fight the Fed" here expecting to "make money" because they didn't rock the boat. Sad.

What I said in the other comment - now everyone say they support SegWit - there's literally no faction that publicly claims they are against it.

One of those "node stats" authors said that is the case. But I didn't press the issue and ask them to reveal their secret sauce.
Yes, "spoofing" as anti-marketing got some attention when those spikes appeared, but I think it only made more people aware of UASF BIP148 and it didn't do much damage because UASF supporters have always said the BIP148 node count is just used to see if our reach out is making a difference.
As I recall those 2-4K fake nodes that someone stood up were hosted on Amazon IPs, so...  Anyone can check the IPs of the current full nodes and determine whether those are simply a bunch of hosted nodes owned by a single person or group.

I agree on the later - it's a good signal that people will go along with this, especially those who just want SegWit and don't have an opinion on larger base blocks. But if the BarryCoiners insist on forcing things the way they've been doing, there may be surprises down the road (before Nov 1).

Of course it's just about money (and power). And that is fine. A free market makes that work to everyone's benefit, as Adam Smith figured out.
The problem is the system wasn't perfectly designed (it was impossible to do that) and now requires some fine tuning.
Such as a UASF followed by an ASICboost kill-patch and potentially more UASF's, **as many as it takes** to restore stability and credibility of the system which are now increasingly in question.
The ongoing bubble is working against Bitcoin as is evident from non-technical objections to UASF such as "it may cause market instability" which is makes Bitcoin more and more like the US stock markets and its governance like Fed meetings. It's all about feeding the bubble and nothing about sound money.

We just need to be patient. No problem.


I mean if SW2X clients lock in SW, then some drop out and there's not enough participation to activate SW. If that happens repeatedly until November 1st, there should be hardfork protection in the code because HF isn't supposed to happen without activated SegWit. 
Are you saying HF countdown is initiated only after SegWit activation, not after lock-in?

I'm almost all in cash and ain't going down with this ship either, but if it does go down I'll help build a better one. Maybe I'll die trying, but I just down want to own a government-licensed vehicle :-)

We don't have scientific polls but just indicators - such as 10 percent of public full nodes and polls done on social media.
It's not "thin air" because support exists and it's significant. It's easy to "like" or "support" random shit on social media, but it takes a bit of dedication to setup or upgrade a node and it's likely the owner has introduced at least 5-10 other users to the importance of UASF.
If Core didn't block the optional BIP148 switch and if this subreddit's rules didn't ban the posting of links to UASF binaries we'd have over 2,000 full nodes by now.

If Bitcoin splits, chains could remain split for weeks and during that time people would be cut off from BIP148 during that time. 
Meanwhile people who withdraw their coins will have access to them at their own convenience no matter what happens.

For 1), only **new** BTC may command a premium (for a while). All legacy BTC will exist on BIP148 chain.
For 3) I'd say "if there's an attack on BIP148..."
But BIP148 coins could also collapse in value if the chain gets attacked by we-know-who.
In any case, we need to try. It's better to fight and lose than lose without a fight.

I am curious to see what story will our stoned conspiracy experts invent this weekend.
How about this: China's government and the UASF movement are planning to take over Bitcoin. 
Because UASF doesn't have enough hash-power to execute a soft fork, they asked the China government to help them confiscate Bitmain's facilities. In return, US-based UASF members have initiated a countrywide manhunt for famous whistleblower Paul Sports who recently threatened to disclose full details of this plan. 
Additionally, DarkNet Market watchers report Beijing announced a reward of 100,000 BIP148 BTC (estimated value: 0.36 "legacy" BTC) for information on Sports' whereabouts.

Part of his business is based on Bitcoin (and an ICO of sorts). I am laughing at your comment right now.
I won't say whether I think Schiff is right or not but I'd only suggest a bit more wait and see (as well as doing more research) before you start laughing. 
Bitmain and BarryCoin show that Bitcoin can actually be threatened and possibly diminished and even destroyed. Except for who supports UASF BIP148 (and doesn't seem to be "laughing") the rest of people who've left comments so far seem to be fairly ignorant of the current situation. 
Do you plan to keep laughing while the ship, not Schiff, is sinking?

That's true, but why do you think Core chain will be immune to Jihan-style 51% attacks after BIP148 abandon the ship? If BIP148 doesn't make it, why would Bitmain let Core survive and retain claim on the brand? 
Whatever small percentage of the hash power BIP148 enjoys now, it's not 0%, so if BIP148 supporters leave, Bitmain's power climbs up to 85% or 90%. It's illusory to think Bitmain only plans to attack BIP148 chain. Their goal is to control Bitcoin, not BIP148 chain.

Those investors who don't have a clue deserve to lose money and will lose money if Bitcoin turns into a shitcoin (stops being a means to achieve greater freedom). There's plenty of time to read news, exit BTC and buy ETH or whatever the hell they're after.

If you add `prune=2000` to bitcoin.conf then you'll have a "thin" (2GB) or pruned copy of the blockchain - takes less space and less toll on IO. Although you have SSD storage, if you have latency-sensitive apps and don't really need a full copy of the blockchain, you can consider that option.

The challenge is to get to 10-15%. If that happens Bitmain is done.

The official procedure is that the miners need to "signal" their willingness to adopt SegWit features. So far (see segwit.co) about 2/3 are against it because of their own reasons (one is that the current congestion on the network makes them $1 million in transaction fees *per day*).
Bitcoin users have decided to take action and the result is UASF BIP148, a patch that enforces SegWit on nodes that install this version of Bitcoin. You can find more on uasf.co.

User community has a hard path toward BIP148 because Core has refused to add `-bip148` option.
Now users - especially less technical ones - have to find the UASF BIP148 repo and build by themselves. Many users (especially organizations) aren't allowed to install non-Core software, so in many regards Core is now blocking BIP148 adoption.
Because they missed to include `-bip148=0` before, now they can redeem themselves only by including it as `-bip148=1` to be activated by default.

Look, Core - according to its members - has no authority to make decisions such as to add `-bip148` option. If that's the case then they also have no authority to insert BarryCoin hard-fork code just because that group of miners and businesses decided that for everyone.
Or they (Core) can continue with their independence and not support either soft fork (BarryCoin or BIP148) in Aug/Sep. Then when BarryCoin hard-forks Core nodes won't be able to work on that network. According to your definition Bitcoin would cease to exist....

There's no use (except for the looks - node count) if you're not transacting.
But you should probably run it if you have BTC; if the chains remain split for a while and you want to use your coins on the BIP148 chain, you may want to have a choice. But you need to have BTC under your control before Aug 1 for that.

Don't look at those numbers, they don't matter much.
Some miners are signaling for SegWit but it won't happen because of Bitmain's obstruction.
UASF BIP148 is an attempt to boycott the obstructionist miners and take our business to only those miners who are willing to mine our transactions and SegWit transactions as well. This is starting on August 1. The message is simple: Bitcoin belongs to users, not miners, and should remain true to its original principles.
There's another (separate) attempt to activate SegWit in a bastardized manner and it's appropriately called FrankenSegWit. This is organized by the malicious miner cabal. Currently scheduled for July 21 to preempt UASF.

Off-chain transactions don't require any permissions. Anyone create their own hub and the number of hubs isn't limited - we need just 1 public hub that doesn't censor transactions (for example, from a private satellite).

If you run a UASF BIP148 node and don't do anything with it, there's zero risk (and zero help to UASF).
If you want to receive or send BTC after August 1, then you may send/receive while chains are split. 
The "risk" of chain splitting isn't a risk at all. It's only a risk if you send/receive cluelessly during that time and it doesn't matter of which chain you do that. So even if you didn't support UASF BIP148 and had the regular Core software, you'd still be exposed to the same risk if sending and receiving while the chains are split.

I also think this is correct. BarryCoiners' argument against this is if they do it nothing prevents the users from **not** doing a hard-fork later on. Imagine - if they be nice, later on users may have a **choice** to bail from a poorly designed code!

Correct. But that is valid only after the moment of HF, then you *have* to install BarryCoin or BarryCoin-compatible bits or else you're out. Even if BarryCoin-compatible bits be available from Core, that would only mean Core became subordinate to BarryCoiners. 
If someone is against BarryCoin now, then to continue to use Core and pretend that's somehow neutral is disingenuous at best.

That is most likely false, as I explained here:
tl;dr: if they don't support multiple chains they'll most likely have to suspend service until the chains merge or fork.
BIP148 already enjoys a lot of support. It needs just two Tier 2 exchanges or 1 Tier 1 exchange to take over. 
Some smaller exchanges already committed to supporting BIP148 wallets.

Bitcoin can't solve all issues in your life. It only gives you a chance to take certain matters a bit more under your own control.
In this concrete example 
* the bank most likely won't help you with transactions the government doesn't permit (unless you use HSBC)
* a trusted 3rd party can't run off with your money unless they collude with the seller. there are reputable 3rd parties and in many situations the likelihood of collusion is low. there are other types of multisig-transactions, such as 2-of-2 or 3-of-5, which work better in some cases. After SegWit and larger blocks kick in multisig may be become cheaper and more useful.
In some ways the government decreases efficiency and usefulness of Bitcoin. Until they're destroyed, or Bitcoin improved, some things will simply not work well.

2) It's running on mainnet (and testnet, although I haven't tried to use it there). 
3) It's been tested by Core devs (-bip148 pull request in Core repo)
BarryCoin has no code (so obviously it hasn't been tried on either mainnet or testnet), it plans to implement a lot of changes including a HF.
And it's supposed to be take effect **before** UASF BIP148.

If bitcoin is "digital gold" then it's okay for it to have high transaction fees.
For currency use cases, where tx frees should be low and confirmations fast, it is okay to use a shitcoin, but after Layer 2 solutions are developed it may still be possible for Bitcoin to work well for this use case as well.
Other cryptocurrencies are of no interest to me at this time. Because almost any will do, it's not necessary to own any particular shitcoin.

Thumbs up for highlighting the different interests - it's not just miners and (or against) "the community", it's more complex than that. For example now we have BarryCoin, a new group of bit-politicians backed, or influenced by, Bitmain.
BarryCoin now aims to either take over Core or become the main Bitcoin implementation. It's more and more looking like a central bank (miners as oligarchs and BarryCoin as Bitcoin's Central Bank). 
Speaking of investors: amazingly the typical clueless "investor" thinks an ever-centralizing Bitcoin can have some value or even more laughably increase in value. It can't. The price of a weakly-centralized BTC is going to trend toward $0.
UASF is the best short term hope for Bitcoin. **Not** to bring about SegWit, but to start enforcing the original idea of Bitcoin.
Any other Bitcoin becomes just the least bad cryptocurrency. Just like the US dollar is probably the least bad fiat to own.
But while I unfortunately have to own *some* fiat, I don't have to own or use any crypto. 
Those who think that Bitcoin can be governed and managed using the central bankster approach forget that here, participation is optional.

Was it ever different? If you replace "people" with "the government", or Core, or "the miners", it's no different. 
Freedom is a right, but it requires vigilance and responsibility. Some people find that exhausting so they delegate to the pros and gradually lose it. Bitcoin isn't meant to work that way IMO. One of those shitcoins (Dark or whatever) has regular forks - they're non-events. We should strive to achieve similar resilience.

@_date: 2017-06-14 14:16:26
This is ridiculous and **totally wrong**!
Anyone who stays on legacy chain thereby allows BarryCoin to take over and will **have to** upgrade to BarryCoin before hard-fork. In the meantime (after August 1st, while your backup wallet is offline) you won't be able to safely access your Bitcoins on any chain. So to do nothing is simply to postpone your decision to install BarryCoin and in the meantime you're helpless and can't react to any changes in the environment.
The only logical choice is to support UASF BIP148 and ensure that one can access his or her BTC wallet on all chains and this usually involves setting up own full node(s) or finding a wallet that will safely support all chains. 
UASFGuide.com explains why this is important.
@_date: 2017-06-10 07:49:04
I realize this isn't helpful to the poster, but many will want to know whether the fork is technically sound. If it's not, they won't hard-fork (ie they may hard-fork to another hard-fork). A poor man's indication to the soundness of a proposed hard fork is Core support. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:15:20
It is but it's currently incompatible with BIP148 so it still forces BIP148 to fork (and his PR tries to fix that).
But it's a shitty compromise - anyone who installs BarryCoin (whether it be compatible with BIP148 or not) implicitly marginalizes Core and endorses BitMain's vision of Bitcoin which ain't pretty.
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:35:17
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:11:07


Right away, it won't, but few months down the road Core clients will have to adopt NYA changes or fork to something else. 
To stay with Core doesn't get anyone off the hook in terms of picking sides. You get on NYA coin by default and have to install their hard-fork if you don't want to create your own hard or soft fork. Maybe Core will come up with a non-SegWit soft or hard fork before NYA hard fork but it will still be a fork just like BIP148 is now. 
And I think whatever plan Core comes up with later, it would enjoy less support than BIP148 enjoys now because by then if BIP148 doesn't prevail, many BIP148 and Core supporters will move on.

It may hurt the price in the short term, but Bitcoin wasn't created to make traders rich. 
Besides, if malicious miners and BarryCoiners take over, I see no reason why BTC shouldn't keep going down forever. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:38:49
But that doesn't make sense.
If non-miners don't upgrade to BarryCoin later on, and install Core or some other Bitcoin implementation, we'll be back to square 1.
As many have noted the right way is to make users *want* to install SW2 software, not try to force that decision (while creating complications and risks with this weird attempt to "lock in" a HF).
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:44:20
I said BIP148 requires no client update in the case it activates. 
There's over 7,000 nodes on the network (maybe 10-15,000 if non-visible nodes are counted) that will have to be upgraded to BarryCoin or else they'll drop out. 
For BIP148 which already enjoys 30% miner support it is reasonable to assume that if Core added `-bip148` option we'd need only 21% of new miners (on top of those who signal for SegWit) to go along to take us to over 50% and virtually assure a smooth transition. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:53:49


Nope. To give you one example: once BarryCoin activates and locks in hard-fork, you *cannot stay* on the default chain past the HF activation date unless you install BarryCoin, so by doing nothing you merely postpone your decision to support BarryCoin.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:43:30
I think it would come down to convenience - in such a situation, would it be easier to have a (say) BTC/LTC wallet and use LTC for small tx and BTC for large, and use a decentralized exchange (or Shapeshit) to move coins between BTC and LTC, **or** deal with external programs, PGP keys and whatnot.

Basically, nothing. You'll have to go through the same routine that we've been with BIP148, but it's going to be harder because more people will be complacent. 
So-called decentralization supporters (May 2017): "We want to activate SegWit, kill ASICboost and prevent these reckless changes."

Core is where more development is done, and SW2X where (for now at least) more miners are and of course SW2X would like to take lead (unjustified, but in any case).

Yes if you don't screw up otherwise (e.g. forget to encrypt your email or leak your private PGP key or something).

Thanks for taking the time to write this.


As of v0.13.1, not 13.1.
Also, that sentence is unclear - it should say all Bitcoin Core nodes v0.13.1 or later are SegWit-ready. Instead it (attempts) to say that most of the network has been ready since v0.13.1 came out (and 0.13.1 became &gt; 50% of all nodes on the network), but the current phrasing makes it too confusing for those who aren't familiar with these details (those who need to read this).

WTF is "Bitcoin's software"?
Once BarryCoin (BTC1's Bitcoin) takes effect and locks in HF, nobody needs to ask you to upgrade. If you don't upgrade (either to BarryCoin or a BarryCoin compatible Bitcoin Core, you will get kicked off the network when HF takes effect. 
Likewise if you stay on Bitcoin Core and don't install BIP148 (then you stay online but end up on an incompatible chain much sooner - on August 1)

See UASFGuide.com for different strategies.
$100 isn't a lot so if you move them twice and pay $7, you'll "lose" $14 or 14%. 
I probably wouldn't move it if I had only $100, but then again if it was up to me I'd sell some now and buy back on  July 21, then send BTC to my own wallet

It seems most people are concerned by the fact that BCC has some value, as if that doesn't directly benefit them. For example until recently BTC was $2800, now it's $2500 and BCC is $300 (or whatever). If BCC crashes, it won't be a threat and BTC will likely go up to $2800 again. 
It may be annoying for many BTC holders, but BCC are not doing anything unlawful as far as I can tell.

Those stories are nonsense. Any such prediction is completely random. 
7 billion people, 21 million BTC. So you need just 0.2-0.3 BTC to eventually get "rich" (compared to the average person). 
Now you own 1 BTC, so there's no reason to buy more. 
Oh, and there's also no reason to spend BTC either - if those theories are true, BTC is the best investment vehicle on earth and you wouldn't be able to match such returns with any other investment. 
Don't add, don't spend and hope the stories are true.

Core devs turned the idea of `-bip148` option into a chicken and egg problem: `-bip148` option was rejected because it didn't enjoy overwhelming support (if it did, we wouldn't need it). And of course it didn't because it's fairly new and users are just hearing about it. Because it's not included, it's somewhat hard to learn about it.
I just commented in another post: I wonder what Core will say about BarryCoin patches. I think they must not be included in Core unless both `-bip148` and `-barrycoin` are offered as mutually exclusive non-default choices to users.
(They could also be made mutually compatible; for example if the both are set to ON, then FrankenSegWit would activate in a BIP148 compatible way. But there's probably not enough time to develop and test all these fancy options in 2-3 weeks).
A soft-fork at first is enough for SW activation.
@_date: 2017-06-10 07:47:06
66% is on the other side, so they can't successfully attack without ending up with 33% (and leaving themselves exposed to attack from the BIP148 chain's 34%).
But even this doesn't matter. The moment Jiahanists attack, the value of legacy BTC will start going down and users start leaving in droves. Why the fuck would anyone want to hold or use such miners?

Sell non-BIP148 coin because you don't want to own JihanCoin. 
JihanCoin aka BarryCoin is going to destroy Bitcoin's potential. Even if it wins you'll be able to buy it again for the same amount in fiat because it's very unlikely to go up vs. now ($2,500).
Whether it's better to sell right now or on Aug 1 (or not at all) is a matter of strategy and prediction. My own guess is if it wins, I should be able to buy it cheaper in August (although I will most definitively not be buying any).

Miners decide for themselves (see BarryCoin) so that's that.
Core doesn't formally represent users, so I think they don't want to make deals on the community's behalf. 
In such a situation it is up to us, Bitcoin users, to vote with our money. For example you can support UASF BIP148 rather than call on Core to decide things on your behalf and thereby directly **promote and accelerate** centralization of Bitcoin - which is exactly the opposite from what needs to be done to neutralize malicious miners.
I am thankful to Core devs who recognize the danger and refuse to fall into this centralization trap. I just wish they didn't disarm users by refusing to include "-bip148" option (which would have been disabled by default) in v0.14.2.

I already told you, just read top ("hot") posts and you'll see why. 
One of currently hot posts links to this article:
BIP148 splits everything, not just SW transactions, so in case it happens (independently of SW2) the miners on this BIP148 chain would likely mine all transactions on that chain. Users would need to run a UASF BIP148 client (based on Core 0.14.1, soon 0.14.2).
On SW2 chain, after Aug 1: 
* miners could mine SW or legacy transactions (they'll likely mine the both but could mine only the latter)
* users could use their old clients they have now, until Nov 1 when a HF scheduled by SW2 would happen

Also that (the later you wait the more you profit), but I was thinking if you're a Bitmain minion you can't just do you own thing even if it's in your economic interest. 
Bitmain minions should at least hedge (as that can be done fairly anonymously), but if they do that they make it more attractive for all non-Bitmain affiliated miners to do the same and buy BIP148 BTC. But there are very few markets where this can happen. Yesterday I wrote a [post]( that points out that even anti-UASF supporters wanting to buy and sell BTC148 BTC. I don't know why market makers are so slow in making that happen.

A different variant, in case of a hard fork, would be created. Unlike with most altcoins a wild HF wouldn't start from 0, but would continue from the moment of HF. 
A spin off would probably use a different port, logo, etc. to make it possible to avoid conflicts with BTC on the same network. It wouldn't need a genesis key/block because it would build on top of Bitcoin's blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:30:33
Nothing AnonymousRev said is right. 
SegWit 2X (currently in alpha release) activates faster and if all New York Agreement participants deliver on their promise, SegWit will activate before August 1. 
That will push non-BarryCoin (non-SegWit2X) miner nodes to also start signaling SegWit support.
Then on August 1 when UASF BIP148 kicks in, its nodes will refuse blocks made by non-SegWit supporting nodes but at that time there won't be any left. 
So everything he said is wrong. Of course my statements reflect the current state of affairs.

I wonder whether the benefits would outweigh the downsides - for example dealing with hashrate adjustments and such.
It's certainly beneficial to keep what's good or eases ecosystem integration (API compatibility, for example), but if the coins significantly diverge then APIs become incompatible and may be there's a lot of legacy baggage and still no API compatibility. I haven't looked (but at some point I'll take a look) by how much ETH and ETC diverged by now.
Probably there aren't enough differences in views to justify a hard fork yet. Take for example the ridiculous BarryCoin: its stated purpose is the same as it's purported enemy's - SegWit and larger non-SW blocks. The main difference is BarryCoin wants to make the latter happen few months later. It's simply not worth a hard fork (although a HF may still happen).
If more significant improvements were on the table (new PoW, for example) I would be interested. But it'd also have to be sufficiently different from existing alts.

Most if not all info is out in public. I support UASF BIP148 but every holder has enough information to protect himself in advance.

Temporary fixes (including the inclusion of `-bip148` in Core, which seems like a conservative fix to me) may turn out to be expensive down the road (next time they include something more risky, etc.), so I guess there's no other way than to rely on ourselves to get things done. 
Regarding other coins, sooner or later there will be a monster crash and people will learn their lesson. Not many coins will live through the next 5 or 10 years. 
For now I'm focusing on what I can do to make Bitcoin better, and that's (IMO) is helping UASF BIP148 succeed.

As others have noted and as UASFers have been saying all along the *number* of nodes has no technical importance.
**But** unfortunately some people consider that figure, together with other data, when they decide whether UASF enjoys significant support. For example I believe some Core devs look at this data.
Secondly, it's useful to have your own full node and especially a UASF BIP148 full node, because on Aug 1 those who have it will be able to have full control of their BTC on the both chains.
Therefore I support the call from the OP.
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:36:40

What's changed (between Core 0.13.1+ and SW2X) is the signaling method for activation. This doesn't change anything except the way SW is activated (from BIP141 to BIP91/BIP148-compatible approach, as it currently stands based on SW2X alpha release).
SW blocks by default aren't ASICboost-minable, but the rest (non-SW) still is. An overall "fix" proposed [here]( hasn't been coded or introduced anywhere (even by Bitcoin Core, although that's less important now since SW2X will be the version that most miners will run until Hard Fork in November and possibly beyond) yet.

My answer would be "if fucking depends".
It depends on who owns the patent(s) and what they plan to do with them.
In this case there's a commitment (pledge) to use the patent in ways that don't make it a threat.
The EFF said the pledge is sound.
*Together, these three commitments represent a huge step forward—they assure that Blockstream’s patents will never be used to attack others, even if the company goes out of business or sells them to another company.*

Tim Swanson is the authority on "excuse identification".
One of his inventions is similar but different to "the miners are anonymous and we don't trust them" - he claims that legally you aren't allowed to let a North Korea based miner mine your transaction because you'd be conducting business with North Korea. Because you can't decide which miner to use, you can't use Bitcoin at all.

That's an optimistic view.
In the current BarryCoin PR most comments from non-NY Agreement participants were brushed aside. That means any and all future changes proposed by "non-compliant outsiders" that don't go along with the "vision" and decision making approaches introduced by BarryCoiners can, and likely will, be treated the same way. 
That doesn't seem like a great deal for the outsiders: "new Core" makes decisions (for example, related to block size increases) any way they like, while "old Core" is left to fiddle around with PRs related to client (UI) and SegWit-related development (which will be delayed or neutralized by "easy" block size changes as soon as SegWit gets a chance to attract enough users to make a dent in Jihan's pocket). 
Or one can fork (hard or soft) and ignore BarryCoiners.

What do you think Core will do? They didn't sign anything and they hinted that they won't accept the poorly designed big block implementation, but they didn't say what they will or intend to do.
If this BIP148-compatible FrankenSegWit activates, by November Core will *have* to do something. Assuming their earlier indications are unchanged, they'll have to institute another HF (or maybe a "CASF" of sorts, although they claimed they have no authority to "CASF" Bitcoin Core) which is no different from the current situation (for example, they could add `-bip148=1`).
Or they could change their mind and accept BarryCoin patches which would cement Bitmain's dominance and speed up the centralization.
Either way, this "compromise" doesn't buy decentralization supporters anything - it just postpones this decision (on how to respond to Bitmain's threat) for later.

Can they practically provide their service without their own full nodes? I know they could use Web APIs but that's not reliable, require API keys, etc. It would seem natural to run your own full node if you're a LN operator. 
I didn't look at their incentives yet. I thought they get paid for their services (in which case having a full node helps you do it better, so indirectly the incentive would seem to be present).

Five weeks from now Core may end up having to endorse or even promote BIP148 or else BarryCoiners and Bitmain will take over.
If they included -bip148 in next release they could leave it to end users and UASF would prevail. 
Now it's getting dicey and if they act they'll be seen as taking sides (same as before) but if they don't they'll be wiped out (as they're not involved in FrankenSegWit which will soon be unleashed onto the world). Not a good situation for Core.
If UASF BIP148 didn't exist they would be in an even worse situation. Fortunately, users have created their own solution so we're not totally bare-handed.

If Blockchain doesn't let you set a "priority" or enter desired fee, then it's out of your control and you would have to use a different wallet which does let you do that (for example Electrum for DIY).

1) Your coins get stuck at Coinbase. Since Coinbase (so far) has no plans to do anything at all, you can't safely send them out (withdraw).
2) As long as the chains remain split, your coins are stuck at Coinbase. Most exchanges vaguely "recommend" to refrain from using Bitcoin during the split. If chains split for weeks, you may be cut off for weeks.

Yes, but (based on trends) your exchange may go out of business, your coin may fork and so on.
It's definitively not "automatic". If you think the price of Bitcoin goes up just because it's a trend, you're wrong. It goes up because many people contribute and fight for it - that's what gives Bitcoin value.

What's the link supposed to tell me? I don't see anything new there. What I said is BarryCoiners can modify their code so that their code becomes BIP148 compatible by Aug 1. Currently BarryCoin code does *not* work like that, as I said in my previous comment.


I didn't assume they won't do it, I assumed BarryCoiners complete the code as scheduled and deliver a stable and well engineered release (very unlikely, so I had to assume). 
The point about percentages is 83% signed the agreement, but 30% are signaling SW support, so at least 13% of the people who signed up for BarryCoin aren't malicious miners - they were fooled into signing this because Bitmain and Barry told them a nice story.
If the code doesn't have wide community support or other issue, at least some of those 13% could exit.

The tweet is BIP141 and BIP148 friendly and that's good.
But as you say the big block bullshit is still there - if his gets in, Core loses custody of Bitcoin development.
Anything BarryCoiners decide to do later can follow the same menu strategy - add a bit of chocolate and pepper it with a ton of Bitmain shit.
Also, the tweet omits to note that the fix works ONLY for SegWit until the HF hits (later this year) at which point ALL clients have to install BarryCoin.

2MB may not, but 8MB will. 


Many households have internet connection with a bandwidth cap. A friend who I asked told me that with 1 MB blocks he can run full node, with 2MB he'd hit the limit and have to buy a higher plan. 


And it's not concerning to you that Jihan has enough hashing power to deliver on his percentage commitment from NYA **and** on top of that allocate probably another 5-10% of the **total** hashing power to attack and hard-fork UASF BIP148 chain?

One Tier 1 exchange said they'll allow withdrawals but not when (and while your coins are stuck you won't be able to trade/deposit/withdraw) so that's totally useless.

Everyone is greedy, that's not a problem. That's why people invest in activities like mining and development of the Lightening Network. They have $X and they want to have 2*$X.
A big problem is that the network rules require 95% of the miners to support a change like SegWit. So now if you want to make sure that SegWit never happens, it just takes 6% of the hashing power and the network becomes a hostage to this small player or group.
The present situation in Bitcoin is much worse - due to dislocations in "the real world", a group of miners has managed to collectively control much more of the hashing power, so not only are they delaying SegWit, but are also trying to take over Bitcoin.
Fairness means that a person can decide to use, or not use the network. The same goes for the miners - they can mine Bitcoin or some other coin. Or they can sell their miners and do something completely different.
The network must serve the users and this basic insight has been lost in recent years. UASF BIP148 is an attempt to fix that. 
If UASF by some chance doesn't succeed, the miners will get their their "fair" share of losses because the users will go to other coins. I certainly will.

Good questions. 
I think they're trying to see how the FrankenSegWit PR will look like and then make a statement.
But I'm still not happy that at the same time the BIP148 PR is not given a higher priority by Core. 
In the meantime we can't link to UASF BIP148 repos here and Core is silent, so every day new users are not only downloading (official) binaries that make them completely unaware of what's going on but also jump in line for a future "upgrade" to FrankenSegWit (if/when it comes out). That's rather puzzling. 
Hope to hear some concrete statements of directions and more action from Core.

1) If you're a miner, join a UASF mining pool on Aug 1
2) If you're a frequent user, use BTC on the BIP148 BTC chain starting Aug 1 (for this you need to install a full node, or use a wallet or exchange that supports BIP148).
When you use BTC on Aug 1, it's best to split BTC (and maybe sell "legacy" BTC)
3) If you're an infrequent user, or any other user, ask others to use BIP148 (including your exchange, wallet provider)

Rip offs have a huge educational value (probably much higher than state education). Once enough people have been ripped off, they'll be scam-prone in real life too. In this way we could terminate the SEC itself.
There are many scams and most are approved by the state. Social security is one such huge scam. SSNs represent unique non-tradeable (edit: was "traceable" due to autocorrect) tokens. You can't refuse to participate and can't exit either. And it negatively impacts a lot more people yet no one who is against ICO's likes to complain about the numerous state Ponzis.

SegWit will now activate on its own (based on BIP141 rules).
In recent days SW2X miners made a commitment (via bit4) to soon start rejecting non-SW blocks, and that's what now driving the SW BIP141 activation (together with prior BIP141-voting miners, although most have later also joined BIP91 of SW2X). Because bit4-activated change is already locked in, now SW2X miners just need to deliver on bit1 (SW) to drive BIP141 to activation.

Most participants are utterly clueless as to what's going on. The price doesn't indicate anything except that clueless users are pouring their money into BTC because that's the entry point to all crypto.
Owners of BTC aren't really interested in doing much about the current situation (example: the OP) - they just want somebody to fix it for them. That is expected - just as no fiat user is expected to participate in FOMC meetings or QE activities, most Bitcoin users aren't interested in engaging beyond that level (such as watching Github or running a full node of particular version).
That is why we now have a mess at our hands and Bitmain and BarryCoin are setting themselves up to become the Fed and Wall Street of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:19:28
So you're supporting this SF+HF combination without actually knowing or having confidence that it will work well.
And there's nothing to "evaluate" after SegWit: this release locks in a big block HF, so to get **out** of this wonderful "solution" another undo softfork or hard fork would be necessary, **as well as** enough hashing power. This is the same or probably harder task than UASF would be now.
Bottom line is you're supporting something unknown that gives more power to Bitmain without actually solving anything.

Any exchange that lists BIP148 should see an insane amount of BIP148/BTC trading and make a decent profit.

Jam: well, if exchanges have 2,000,000 users who want to withdraw to 1 address each, that's almost 1 week of transactions. 
Not all will withdraw but those who do may withdraw to more than 1 address. If you add just 500,000 extra transactions to existing trend and assume they'll be concentrated in the last week of July, it's not hard to see how people who attempt to withdraw on (say) July 25 may not be able to receive their coins by August 1st.
Technical understanding of UASF: it's not that hard. Several fairly detailed guides to coin splitting have been posted and at least one (see [1]) is specific to exchanges. They need to setup a replica of BTC servers and wallets, initiate a timely split for all BTC balances, add a Legacy/BIP148 currency pair and enable BIP148 BTC deposits and withdrawals. 
But even if it was difficult, it couldn't be a reason for being silent on this. They could say "it's difficult we'll have something by July 21 to give you a choice", but they aren't saying anything because they hope UASF BIP148 will go away. I think that's because of [2].

I won't run BarryCoin either. 
But someone will have to fork Bitcoin Core and get users and miners to fork. 
Core stated they have no authority to create such fork-enabling software (when we asked them to add `-bip148` to Core 0.14.2). Who will create this software? Or do you think they will change their mind?
If they don't change their mind, then in September we'll have exactly the same situation as we have now: need to fork and get miners and users to switch. While there may be more end users pissed off at Bitmain, my guess is there will be fewer miners willing to rock the boat. And also just like today, Bitmain will come up with a plan to attack dissenting chains. 
Those who care about decentralization will be in exactly the same spot in September as they are now.

No, they don't both create a new chain and BIP148 is not confusing at all (except to the extent that BarryCoin's FrankenSegWit made it so).
BIP148 creates compatible blocks that old clients can still work with without changing their software. It boycotts miners that refuse to signal for SegWit and the only change required to eliminate disruption is for the obstructionist miners to start signaling for SegWit (it takes 5 mins to make that kind of a change). The main source of confusion is the malicious miners, not BIP148 itself. UASFGuide.com has useful info in case the malicious miners remain malicious.
BarryCoin's planned hard fork introduces both significant risks **and** disruptions - thousands of clients have to be upgraded to new and unproven (no testnet deployment is planned as far as I can tell) software within several short months.

Only Core can tell you and maybe not even them (if they haven't decided).
BIP148 will happen and the COOP is an alternative to FrankenSegWit that (unlike FSW now) does not mess with existing signaling.
If BarryCoiners were smart they would have used a UASF compatible approach like COOP. They don't have much time to get their shit together. And they can't delay either because BIP148 strikes on Aug 1.
I somehow don't think BIP149 will matter. 
If BarryCoin looks too risky in early July in my opinion Core would be better off to include -bip148 (be aggressive and set it to ON by default) and kick off a four week MASF/UASF upgrade campaign. That way a disaster can be easily avoided.

IMO Core developers do not have the mandate to accept BTC1 patches and make them on by default. Either both `-bip148` and `-barrycoin` or neither should be included in the same release, and if they're included they should both default to OFF.

@_date: 2017-06-15 13:53:45
Because 
a) It forcefully introduces big blocks 
b) It makes it clear that Core's opinion is merely advisory (almost no Core dev endorsed this proposal)
c) It demonstrates that any future changes Bitmain wants to make can be introduced the same way (by waiting until Core or anyone outside BarryCoin wants to add a feature, and then combine that together with something BarryCoiners want and release it as a "bundled" release just like this SegWit2X).

All those risks exists but that scenario is more acceptable to many (for example 70% of the miners) otherwise they'd get behind SW and remove the risk of split. 
Clearly the non-SW miners calculate they gain more by fighting UASF than preemptive it with SW signaling or MASF BIP148 and they're not the only ones - various crony businesses are on their side as well.
The BarryCoin people with its FrankenSegWit trick are also for this because they still refuse to support BIP141. They think the risk and loss in August chain war is less compared to gains from HF they want to force onto users with FrankenSegWit. 
I agree that those risks exist, but I disagree that's the worst thing that can happen.
Clearly there are groups and individuals who think the worst thing is to not lock-in a HF or whatever other scenarios they want to make possible by fighting against UASF BIP148.

It seems you think some groups will hard-fork from Bitcoin. 
I am not convinced just yet and I hope many Bitcoin miners will realize they have more to lose than us and support UASF (not BIP141, not BIP148-friendly BarryCoin, but UASF), but if they fail to do that then further fractioning or decline are unavoidable and I don't want to help create value of a non-free, centralizing coin.

When UASF BIP148 was announced, we had well over 2 months to upgrade several mining pools. 
Now (if BarryCoin takes over) we'll have a bit more time to upgrade **thousdands of user nodes and apps** to an untested version of Bitcoin.
Now (thanks to Bitmain, but also to some extent to Core's stumbling (namely the refusal to offer `-bip148=0`)) **everything** is risky. 
As things stand now BIP148 will be one chain, BarryCoin another, and those who refuse to support BarryCoin will later end up on yet another (if they don't make a choice and pick BarryCoin or BIP148, which is why I say this choice hasn't changed).
@_date: 2017-06-10 07:23:05
How is it a fact when it hasn't happened?
BarryCoin has zero support from anyone from Bitcoin Core devs and there's just 1 or 2 Core devs who are trying to help those clueless BarryCoiners from creating a disaster. Even if BarryCoin code is completed it's unlikely it will be released as "Bitcoin Core".

Not true. You can stay on the legacy client (and chain) and normally receive payments on the BIP148 chain (you won't see them until you switch, though). 
Don't stay on the legacy chain. It takes 5 mins to upgrade your client to a UASF BIP148. Or install the both if you want. There's enough info on what to do, for example UASFguide.com.

If someone is not convinced enough to publicly state support for UASF I doubt there's much use in getting their anonymous vote (which carries no commitment).

I don't think they'll get enough support, but first and foremost the code must be sound, and then the changes proposed must have enough support.

I am lazy to check but 0.13.1 should be the oldest release that understands SegWit
And 0.14.1 UASF SegWit 0.3 BIP148 for the UASFers
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:47:55
I don't think they wil. 
I just say if I were Core and if BarryCoin continued with their FrankenSegWit machinations until end of this month (June), I would release a `-bip148=1` upgrade and execute a 4 week upgrade campaign. 
There's more than 4,600 public nodes (bitnodes.21.co) running 0.14 or higher so it's fairly safe to assume that most of those guys follow the news and would be able to upgrade. That should make the risk of UASF148 very low. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 06:25:51
I pledge to sell my BTC on legacy chain on Aug 1 or before. I will buy BIP148 BTC on Aug 1.
In the case UASF doesn't win, the price of legacy bitcoin will keep dropping because there would be nothing else to prevent tx fees from rising throughout 2017 and beyond without a chance for a non-contentious solution anytime soon. That's why I think the risk of exiting legacy BTC is low - even if UASF fails I'll be able to buy back and profit (although I personally won't be buying BTC unless UASF wins).

The schedule itself is crazy so even if they were on schedule that wouldn't be assuring. 
They unnecessarily introduce risk (by not wanting to use BIP141 or create a signaling mechanism compatible with BIP148) although that doesn't ensure success of their hard fork (which is supposedly the reason for risks they're taking).
The most insane part is they want to move everyone to their implementation - those who don't will end up cut off the network within few short months (or else Core must issue a release that attempts to follow BarryCoin's workings). 
I was under the impression they'll ask core to merge their changes, but that's not the case.

Legacy miners will mine on legacy chain. 
In order to attack BIP148 chain they must mine BIP148 chain and stay there. 
For that to happen, someone (like ... we know who) has to fund this activity because without that funding there's no reason for a miner to miss income on legacy chain. 
Let's assume both of these things happen (someone pays the miners to attack the BIP148 chain and keep doing that.) Expected result: 
* Person who funds this activity gets sued, maybe the mining pool(s) as well.
* Legacy BTC suffers a terrible drop in price because now even the vision impaired realize that BTC has turned into a shitcoin
* Users massively abandon legacy BTC

The reason Bitcoin has been successful is that it works differently from the corrupt fiat system. But due to the same decentralized characteristics you can't remain apolitical if you're a stakeholder. 
If you idly stand by and don't declare or act on your beliefs, transactions may eventually become cheaper but less anonymous. Some people are okay with that, some aren't.
If there's something you don't like (like high transaction fees) you need to act.

You can get feeds from each trade (that's how they get the info and you can get the same info by visiting the exchange or using their API).
If the last trade was  then the price can't be different than that. Of course the exchange can create dummy accounts to buy and sell from each other, but the same is possible on a decentralized exchange (only it will cost more).

Bullshit. How can they hardfork to 2X without activating SW which in turn can't be done without signaling for it?
The agreement called for "immediate" (asap) signaling  and if they didn't want to deliberately undermine BIP148 they could have started signaling for SW before July 21).
This is from the DCG Medium post:
We agree to immediately support the following parallel upgrades to the bitcoin protocol, which will be deployed simultaneously and based on the original Segwit2Mb proposal: 
Activate Segregated Witness at an 80% threshold, signaling at bit 4
Activate a 2 MB hard fork within six months
@_date: 2017-06-03 09:06:36
That's not very tradeable:-)
I expect 0.05 BTC at 30 min past midnight and I'll buy some.
Legacy BTC: I will leave just the amount necessary to purchase BIP148 BTC. The rest will sit in cash. I see no reason to be long BTC apart from buying 148 BTC. Should UASF fail we'll be back to where we started.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:43:51
Virtually no one from the UASF community is against on-chain scaling. It's not mutually contradicting. Both SW and large blocks are fine.
Even Bitcoin Core developers suggest (see comments below PR on FrankenSegWit) to use Spoonet to enable big blocks, but BarryCoiners are refusing to listen.

Yes, and it's deliberately designed to do two things. Actually one:
* Activate Bit 4 before BIP148, to work *against* BIP148 
* Activate Bit 1 after BIP148, also to work *against* BIP148 and let BIP148 soft-fork before Bit 1 on BarryCoin is in effect
If BarryCoiners had the confidence which they said they had, they could have let BIP148 happen first and release their code after that. If they wanted a peaceful resolution they could have simply signaled BIP141 without *any* code changes and start working with Core on the 2X part, or they could have created a patch that doesn't conflict with BIP148. They did none of these things and it's clear why.

I think most UASFers know what (many) Core devs are saying, but a lot of trust has already been lost: now I believe that Bitmain and other non-SW signaling miners are working against Bitcoin (or, to change Bitcoin and make it CorpCoin) and I am examining whether I should trust anyone but UASF supporters. 
If there's no widespread support UASF will fail; there's no reason to be alarmed if it doesn't take off. Nor if it does, of course.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:55:28


That's what I am complaining about. 
UASF BIP148 is about users taking control of Bitcoin. Then this PR happens and we finally get SegWit, but 3 months from now you'll either have to run BarryCoin code or do another UASF. 
To me - and I'm after decentralization first and SegWit *after* that - this PR isn't useful at all. I'd trade it anytime for `-bip148=0` in Bitcoin Core 0.14.2.
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:45:33
Miners will mine on the chain where it makes sense for them. They do it every day. And in terms of UASF, the chain where active users go will be the chain where the activity is. It's very easy to measure.
It will be a turbulent time but all who are against SegWit BIP141 and chose to fight UASF are doing so because they think they will profit from opposing SegWit, so it's their choice.
You don't avoid risk by sitting idly by, just like the anti-UASF groups don't increase risks by fighting against UASF (they calculate they have to profit more by making it clear they control Bitcoin)

What do you mean by this - longer waits for transactions to confirm?
I like the post. The scenario from the very end (where you said UASF should stop in favor of a "BIP149") is something that isn't widely expected, but a large miner (such as ...) could easily trigger this outcome. And this is why I've been saying Core should have included `-bip148` in 0.14.2 - it's hard to imagine how a "BIP149" could be executed in a less disruptive or reckless manner than this simple option would have.

That's an interesting take. Wall Street has front-run the community. Maybe.
My take is that those UASFers who are in it just for SegWit may soon be satisfied (they'll likely have not just one, but potentially two chains with SegWit support to choose from).
But the BarryCoiners are by no means out of the woods yet - their attitude and incompetence might send a lot more users to UASF by November.

More than 10% of people who run full Bitcoin nodes think there's value in supporting BIP148 so it's definitively not "nobody".
What are the other options: you can do nothing and wait until Bitmain takes control of Bitcoin. 
BarryCoin (FrankenSegWit) is one such attempt and it's scheduled to take place before UASF BIP148 (UASF is Aug 1, BarryCoin July 21). 
If both BarryCoin and UASF fail, then we're back to another **year** of high *and rising* transaction fees and more attacks by Bitmain's Malicious Miner Cabal. If BarryCoin doesn't happen you can rebel/die/exit/etc on Aug 1 or you can watch Bitcoin continue its slide into oblivion.

We should introduce it ASAP and keep working on other solutions.

If A pays no (or less) tax, then B pays more or public debt goes up (which is the same as paying more tax, just postponed until debt is paid or inflated away ruining debt holders, savers and others).

To be fair he mostly quotes other authors (who maybe don't know anything about Bitcoin or economics).
The article makes good points. It's not enough to dismiss it. 
Maybe the price represents the claim on blockchain space, but that's not intristic because it depends on whether anyone is mining the chain or not.

The current release (0.3) of BitCoin Core SegWit UASF BIP148 is the best release
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:51:54
Now there's also a UAHF and other things (see Jihan's blog post) which require non-trivial resources.

GovChain might, and if the likes of Bitmain remain dominant in Bitcoin, it won't be much better here either.
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:23:33
It's been argued - I did it too, here on this sub just yesterday - that Core shouldn't be making such decisions. 
We have a voting system that doesn't fucking work and core can't "fix it" because current voters (some 70% of miners) are voting against Core's recommendations. 
Now we have to make a decision - do we want a dictatorship or voluntarism. 
The former approach can work in the short term (cough, VitalikCoin, cough), but the latter is superior in the medium to long term. 
UASF doesn't need to be painful in the short term - cooperative miners still have weeks to act on BIP141 or BIP148 - it will be painful only if it has to be, if malicious miners and BarryCoiners continue their war on users.

I didn't say that - I said if you want to buy a cup of coffee with Bitcoin, you shouldn't expect to have it **cheaply** recorded **on chain** - it should be handled *off chain* and checkpointed to the blockchain periodically. In other words, support SegWit (and UASF BIP148) and you'll get your cheaper coffee transactions soon. Then after SegWit is available, support development of larger block solutions so that on-chain transactions also become cheaper (for a while).

The stalemate was likely due to a high voting limit. Until NYA (BarryCoin) approximately 1/3 have been signaling BIP141 and 2/3 were not. 
In theory Jihan could directly and indirectly control 70% and instruct 6% of his minions to signal BIP141 just so that it doesn't look like he can command 70% of the hashing power (maybe this is highly unlikely, but it's possible). 
I'd say NYA is evidence that a group (cartel) controls 80% of the hashing power. If the participants deliver on Phase 1 of SW2X, that will become impossible to deny.

I know that. I'm for UASF BIP148 and I'm aware of the possibility that another UASF can be executed later. 
I'd rather persist until UASF BIP148 is done than throw it all away and then do a whole new one two months from now.

BitMex has a contract I think, but I haven't checked the details (just googled it, can't find the damn thing).
Earlier today SW2 merged compatibility with BIP148 so now it's much less likely that UASF BIP148 will create a separate chain.

This is getting off topic so I'll make just one observation:


To a politician it makes far more sense to redistribute other people's income and make sure that no-income guy gets some income (and vote for you) than to kick them out. 
If you tax 1 rich guy and redistribute parts of that tax to 10 no- or low-income people, you lose 1 vote (or maybe none, because every other politician wants to tax the rich guy) and gain 10.

It's up to the commenters to judge whether your question is serious or a shitpost.

We don't need most of the hashpower, so author isn't wrong.

I've already commented about this type of reasoning (seen among some Core members) but I'll say it again: if that happens, there's no need to add the damn thing.
It needs to be added **now** in 0.14.2 because it's the right thing to do. The likelihood of BIP148 prevailing doesn't have anything to do with this decision.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:21:41

Isn't that a small market? 
@_date: 2017-06-10 10:40:53
That is true for some fiat currencies as well.
I think "longstanding" isn't the defining characteristic, but rather an effect - for example the government deliberately makes it hard to exploit inefficiencies (except for the government and their cronies) they create, so the milking can go on as long as they have a captive population to exploit.
A market that has no barriers would make it relatively simple to arbitrage and finally optimize these differences. Bitcoin could become a tool to prevent such "taxation by regulation" but that's why governments are now regulating Bitcoin.

If it starts with 35%, the legacy chain will be dead in hours.
If the hash rate is small then BIP148 BTC will become cheap and a good opportunity for major players to load up on it and then switch to BIP148 chain. 
There's no advantage in staying on the legacy chain. Remember if it comes to UASF it means BarryCoin will have totally crapped out and there is **nothing else** that can be done to make Bitcoin more viable than now before mid 2018.
@_date: 2017-06-10 05:30:22

I don't think this has anything to do with culture. 
If you are worried about losing then you don't start a fight because there's a risk you might lose. 
Obviously Jihan weighted those risks and found them acceptable (if I win, I win big, if I lose, it's going to look ugly). 
The culture factor is overblown, as are conspiracy theories about the China government somehow remote controlling his every move (and by the way if the gov conspiracy were true, the first question about loss of face would become irrelevant)

For me, that is absolutely correct: I prefer SegWit to larger blocks, but I support the both (in that order).
UASF is necessary now because Bitcoin is falling under control of malicious miners (those who refuse to signal SW support). This is a chance to solve this problem and correct the course.

Those who used to boast about Bitcoin's "market cap" and similar nonsense are now looking for a reason why that's not important.
Those who cared about what Bitcoin stands for never gave two craps about ETH's market cap (or the price of Bitcoin, for that matter). Many from this group are now preparing for UASF BIP148.

Yes it would and before I agreed with this reasoning. 
But that was before BarryCoin's plans became clear. In recent weeks it became clear they aren't interested in amicable resolution (they refused to make their version both BIP148 or BIP14 compatible, etc.) and if they do what their agreement says, then a big change will happen but by miners (hardly "grassroots", it's basically a cartel backed by several large businesses).
If miners manage to make *very significant* changes (compared to BIP141 and BIP148) without any community process at all, then I would say Core will have failed in a far worse way than if they included `-bip148=0` (as originally proposed in that pull request). (Also note that BIP148 has gained much less visible support than there is for it *because of Core* - they didn't add this option so it's still very inconvenient to find where to get the BIP148 source and how to build and install them; `-bip148=0` is neutrality and no BIP148 switch present is suppression).
