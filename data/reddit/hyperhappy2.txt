Thanks, that's really cool of you!
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:07:49
Thanks, 6 months of work but I hope it really helps people in the community. Appreciate that you share it!
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:11:47
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:18:44
This is correct :)
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:09:09
It currently is (because of the high fees and transaction times). But the original vision was for it to be a digital currency. With Lightning, this may become more true again..

Haha, there is no air on the MOON !
Thanks :)

Git - not yet but that's planned. Feel free to send a few suggestions here though, we'd appreciate it.
The goal is to provide a high-quality, easy, and illustrated resource to the entire community. Especially beginners often have a really hard time learning about all the concepts. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:41:17
Thanks, we're working on it :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:46:27
Hahaha, you're the first one who noticed that ;) There are about 50 Easter eggs hidden throughout. We're working on a LOT more free content and tools - more soon!

I’m very bullish on Bitcoin. But since I am also smart I love hearing different points of view and dissenting devil’s advocate arguments. “FUD” has become a mindless catchphrase to throw at any kind of intelligent discourse that highlights pros and cons. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:22:12
Oh wow, thank you very much. Love this community :)
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:11:38
And that’s why the post is being downvotes :)
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:06:55
Thanks for the feedback. Would you prefer if the slides can't be swiped with your finger - and instead only be clicked left and right with the arrow buttons?
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:25:50
Thanks, lots and lots of work but I hope it helps people in the community to learn
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:59:43
Haha, thanks, that's really nice of you!
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:08:37
PS: You can find lots of other guides for Ethereum, Crypto, Blockchain, etc. on the home page - plus guides on how to buy, store, use, and secure Bitcoin and Ethereum. And much more... :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:18:19
This is the correct answer
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:12:07
That makes me really happy, awesome! Thanks for checking it out and please share :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:42:55
Yes, I thought so, too
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:34:31
Really? Do you have a source we can look at? Thanks
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:53:23
Awesome, thanks :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:51:47
Awesome, thank YOU!
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:56:03
Interesting, thanks. The entire slide is touch-friendly so you can swipe anywhere. Maybe that's the issue?
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:23:59
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:43:41
Awesome! That's exactly the point - a free, easy resource for the community. Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:51:36
We're working on that :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:50:58
Awesome, happy you liked it - hence my handle ;)

Good point. Thaak you!
We have something similar for the next version and I already added it now: "Tip: Many wallets create a new public receiving address for each transaction to increase your privacy."
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:40:47
No prob :)
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:48:28
Thanks! Good idea 
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:21:47

Thank you for your kind words!
Several people have PM'd about a BTC donation address. I've added one in the footer:

Thank you! Would mean a lot if you shared :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:18:42
The basics are explained here  and here  and we're working on another guide that will explain even more!

This is great, thanks for your contribution. come back and let us know how it goes!
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:27:56
Why 2020 or 2024? Because of reward halving? Thanks
@_date: 2018-05-10 12:51:59
Thank you for your contributions and making the world better. You are a hero of the community!
@_date: 2019-06-03 00:08:05
How come?
@_date: 2019-06-03 00:42:05
Fair enough, let’s see if the demand part will be true
@_date: 2019-06-03 00:22:14
Thanks for explaining. Why would OTC bitcoin run out?
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:48:24
- make it happen please
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:52:26
 under news section
@_date: 2019-06-03 00:08:15
How come? What is this based on?
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:40:58


Can you please share specific examples of these?
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:56:21
NASA Logo &gt; TESLA Logo :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:58:47
Is there a chart that shows this info?
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:58:56
It’s easy, you just do it consistently which builds trust. There are no other guarantees in life.
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:22:38
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:22:00
Got you. How long would you prefer the podcast to be, how often per week, and what topics interest you most? Thanks
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:43:00
Interesting, how come?
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:45:29
Nah, see Joe Rohan and many others 
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:57:48
Nice, will check it out. What do you like about it?
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:12:53
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:44:58
Would love to subscribe to you, can you share or PM the links?
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:57:10
Fair point
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:24:01
Got it. Free, paid, or ads? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:51:56
I agree, but devil's advocate: Why is it impossible? Let's say they would outlaw it, not many people would still hold it, especially since exchanges have to report all sales and have KYC etc requirements.
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:54:15
Hi there, looks cool. What's your goal with the site (why are you building it), if I may ask?
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:33:32
Thanks, autocorrect... also corrected :)
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:31:42
Could you please elaborate on the risk of switching? Thanks
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:24:16
Sources? Thanks
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:22:59
Would you prefer full stories or short summaries?
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:56:52
Feel free :)

@_date: 2018-03-29 22:21:34
Can you ELI5 this for people here? What's your argument please? Store of value (it isn't), payments (far away from that), etc. Honest question...
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:44:31
No price, exactly. Would you prefer YouTube or a podcast?  
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:43:49
I like that. How often would you like to see/hear/rad it and in what ways (email, video, podcast)?
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:58:58
People... panic. Don't really see why though, we're up even for the week. Nuts...
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:23:27
I agree, quality over quantity for sure
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:50:55
Very interesting. What would your dream portfolio web app look like? could you provide more details please?
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:58:40
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:21:26
Wow, that's a lofty goal :)
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:59:01
If one didn't do anything after the last fork (bitcoin cash) and now won't do anything after this new fork, are the original Bitcoin safe? Also, how would you get both new ones out (to sell)?
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:08:47
Thanks, looking forward to it, talk tonight!
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:21:55
Mods, make it so? :)
@_date: 2018-03-25 19:22:41
It would be a mix of coins based on the most important stories 
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:53:40
How come? couldn't they financially incentivize millions of American bank users to participate with their smartphones etc?
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:29:14
Thanks, but I prefer to hear some opinions first, especially what people would be interested in regarding content, frequency, etc. Appreciate your reply though.
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:58:21
No, I plan to sell in many years - if at all
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:55:02


did creating electronic checking accounts, wire transfers, debit cards, etc undermine the dollar? No.


Not necessarily, they could inflate the crypto-currency. It doesn't have to be capped like BTC.


Have read it, but I am proposing that they could create a fiat-coin hybrid and then work on outlawing or punishing crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:59:19
How often and how would you like to receive it?
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:58:04
It will fall and there will be plenty of corrections. But I think that buying and holding saves money on fees, saves nerves, reduced the need to get in and out timing right (which is hard), and minimized taxes (long vs short-term cap gains). So all in all, in a bull market - buy and hold?
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:04:56
Nobody knows that, we are in the early infrastructure phase, it's like betting in 1992 which tech startups will be around.
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:50:21
Thanks. Could you elaborate please?
Are both voluntary and can they be voluntary in succession?
How could one lose coins on new chains (and keep the main Bitcoin)?
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:08:18
Awesome, really excited to hear your thoughts!
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:29:22
What are you saying, time the market at psychological levels like 5k and 10k?
