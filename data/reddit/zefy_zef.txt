Something like Tether (but more legitimate) that pairs with BTC and is trade-able 1:1 with fiat would probably be needed.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:32:00
Yeah, all those people left around the same time (hi!). Personally I'm not going to sit here and call people names, even if I don't agree with them. That shouldn't really be allowed anywhere people are attempting to have honest discussion. Being said, I feel that if someone has a legitimate concern, free discussion should be encouraged; even if we are arguing against actions taken by the mod team or others. I suppose you can say it would degrade the quality of conversation, but I think the linked video spreads the same kind of negative sentiment anyway.
I've said the same thing in the other sub, just focus on what needs to be done, not who's stopping us or holding us back. Ignore Ver, ignore Cash, work on making Bitcoin a great currency. That's what has been missing the past year or so here, IMO, just because (obviously) people have different ideas on what makes Bitcoin better. The devs at the end of the day implement the ideas they like into code.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:03:23
The following is quoted from Roger's website. 
Although I understand the sentiment illustrated in the quote may not be shared, the distinction between the two coins is unquestionably apparent.

Thankfully. It's a route people already do to launder stolen credit cards' funds so, I'm glad it isn't that easy to just convert it to bitcoin..

I personally think it's weird how posts neutral or positive about him are considered off-topic, but negative posts aren't, for... some reason.

They don't need to always support Bitcoin. Notice the support for multiple cryptocurrencies, with more implied in the future? The people who have a lot of money invested *specifically* in Bitcoin are the people that have the most vested interest in its continuing success. I'm talking about the miners and, possibly in the future, the Lightning Node operators. Unless of course they can use their equipment for other things, though.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:06:48
If they were smart they would just come out and say it and sell the unused ones with a higher markup. win-win

Didn't November happen in part because of the false market data coming from gox?

Lol! They always have! All ASIC manufacturers (probably) do that. I remember people complaining about it a long time ago on the securities forums at bitcointalk.

Ummm that statement could be made about literally any cryptocoin..
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:05:02
There is no joke. The moral of the story is that you can't predict how well something will turn out to be, even if it seems great at the time. And at the same time, something that seems bad could be revealed not to be with time. 
Pretty much, patience.

That's a bold claim. Any examples/proof?
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:29:39
The general consensus in the wider crypto community (from what I understand) is that Bitcoin is on the top because it has first-mover advantage. It doesn't work the best. Your comment is correct, to a point. But they'd have to have waited until another crypto with better features topples bitcoin and destabilizes the market, before they implemented a similar coin as bitcoin was.
@_date: 2018-01-27 07:42:43
No, most certainly not. I am definitely hoping for Bitcoin's success, but am looking out for changes that may affect its long-term viability. A lot of newcomers are only seeing Bitcoin and cryptos in general as investment vehicles. That obviously won't keep, but those small differences and improvements to protocol will be what sets them apart from each other in a growing field. There will be a time 'first mover advantage' will lose that last word. They will compete and collaborate on merit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:48:19

I agree, my main issue is why would someone do that knowing full well that Satoshi could just fire that "I am not Craig Steven Wright" message and dispel it all. He would have to either be dumb (doesn't seem so) or know that Satoshi would not send the message. 
Conclusions: Satoshi ded; Wright did it/knows it, Wright in contact with Satoshi; fucking with people, Wright is Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:32:32
No, my point is that whatever position you are trying to represent you are doing a good job at making it seem less desirable.

@_date: 2018-08-02 19:11:23
.... That's fine, it's your choice to remain ignorant of the facts after all.
Back a few years ago when people were trying to come up with new ideas, implementations and such; the general idea was that cryptos would piggy back off each others' advancements and the like for that particular project. The idea got lost along the way. Also, how is bch a ltc copy?

Why do you assume they want to sell? I'm sure there are tons of heavy btc addresses. If they have so much and didn't sell at 2k, they probably won't at 800..

Aye, although we do run a small risk getting banned here. That being said I always try to keep my discourse here polite and urge others to do the same like you have. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 18:15:37
It's funny because bitcoin cash was told to 'fork off' from bitcoin. So they did. Still complaints. Let's be patient and let it all play out before we commit to calling bitcoin cash bitcoin. Whichever has the most accumulated pow. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:05:33
Yeah, that's mostly because btc is more profitable and miners operate on a principle of selfishness, in a way. You can be sure if, somehow, bch (or another coin) was valued more or more profitable in another way they would mine that. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:39:41
That's pretty much the only coin they'll be making now anyways..

The thing is there is an inherent self-defeating mechanism built into bitcoin. Why destroy the credibility of something you've invested so much time and money into? As Andreas A. says the only reason to perform a 51% attack would be to do exactly that, to destroy the credibility of bitcoin.

Wow, good find. Could be he's been planning something like this for a while, or he was like 'hey, I wonder if he still has this huge gaping hole I know about open..'
Also, he was the one on IRC that was giving the first(?) links to the leak, while saying that he isn't the one that did it, but knows the people. Maybe he's trying to make a buck off of their work, or maybe he was the one who did it after all..

I think you are lacking a scope of future. Will 61% of Canadians be using bitcoin in 2019? No fucking way. But does this signify a change in attitudes (depending on accuracy of survey)? Yeah definitely. What do you think the survey response in the US would be, or in specific demographic clusters? I'd say less than 20% would answer 'yes' to a survey asking if they knew what crypto currency was. I'm not hopping on any train here, and there is no correlation without a specific reason, but I like to think I'm sensitive to shifts of focus such as this.

Thank you for the response. I came off a little snarky, with really no reason. Just because I'm not for it doesn't mean there are no points of usefulness about it. I like to consider myself a utopist, which kind of goes against both the facets of ancap. There are so many things capitalism contributes to which with our current level of technological progress can be addressed organically (okay, anarchal) rather than with the tools it currently uses (planned obsolescence, certain marketing concepts, etc.)
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:41:13
The irony is that the stronger you push this narrative, the more people here will be put off by your abrasiveness, or they will look for facts themselves instead of relying on biased propaganda.

@_date: 2014-01-08 04:59:58
Not if they need the refrigerator. Usually people buy stuff because they need it. Again, I think the answer is going to be options. Up until a certain price level, returns in btc may be an option, but above it in the tied-to currency maybe. I don't know but the answer isn't going to be as black and white as people are currently seeing it I think.

And even if he did, he gave it to the world to decide what to do with it. Satoshi also gave us the original code, but that's been improved upon and modified much.
I'm sure he used that symbol as a placeholder as much as the original code was. The concept was really the breakthrough here.

Western Union's policy is *not* to always check for ID on receiving end. You can send money with the option that the receiver has no ID and send it with a 'test question' that the receiver must answer.
This is an odd scam though, haven't seen this type where they claim to hire people as 'mystery shoppers.' Generally it's that someone has won a lottery (wouldn't you know if you entered) they are told to cash a check, and then wire the money *fast* (before the check doesn't clear.) Another is that their grandson is in jail or etc in some other country or state and they are to wire the money to them.

Remembering the past scams of things like labcoin, and the like I am growing more sure that the mining solutions *did* pan out, but they just decided they didn't want to share the profit with the investors. The problem is that this environment seems apt for these sorts of 'conspiratorial-type' ideas to foment, and that's a problem.

And what of the reversible transactions? I can walk into a store, buy something and walk out after it confirms (which who knows how long it will take considering bloat). Then once in the safety of my car I can modify the transaction and make the receiver instead be an address I own. How is this supposed to be OK?
@_date: 2016-01-14 23:20:41
Okay, I can agree that part was a bit unnecessary, no need to throw weight behind your decision by getting other people to also think what you left is failed. I feel Hearn has a habit of going sensational in some parts of his actual valid points so unfortunately people focus on those sensational parts. Let's try to ignore that and address the meat of his complaints. Namely growing the blocksize, somewhat reversible transactions, and centralized decision making. An actual argument put forth was that instead of putting the power of voting to the miners and users of the software, it should be only to the technical experts who create the software.


Just no.

First of all, 2MB is not the effective increase we will receive. I don't know the exact number but I think it's more close to 1.6/1.7. Also, 2MB is what Classic was starting with, but we have already moved passed the need for that capacity.
The fundamental issue at argument right now is whether or not Bitcoin should be a store of value, or a payment layer. Segwit, and all other solutions that don't intend to scale bitcoin to anywhere close to the usage rate of a legacy financial network, only further the cause of moving most bitcoin transactions off-chain. The big money would move on-chain and daily transactions would move off-chain. O-Kay in essence. The problem lies in the fact that Bitcoin itself is decentralized -AWESOME. Off-chain networks being centralized completely defeats the purpose of bitcoin. This is the problem with selecting a specific off-chain network to run the multitude of day-to-day transactions that bitcoin will eventually require.

It isn't exactly an increase of the limit, although the effect is similar. Also Satoshi originally had a larger blocksize limit and reduced it, but understood the future need of an increase.
@_date: 2017-01-21 01:12:58
..because the person specifically stated that Segwit is a block size increase which is not the primary goal of, nor is it factually correct.

If anything though, that reaction will be delayed by the time it takes to get money onto the exchanges and the profit takers will already be gone.
@_date: 2017-01-30 04:41:33
Because it essentially compresses the size of the block by ~~re~~moving data, allowing you to put more data, but without the signatures. It does *not* increase the blocksize, otherwise when people (right here in say we should enact segwit *and* a blocksize increase, you should look at them like they've grown two heads. In other words, if they are one and the same thing then why would be people be considering to do *both* things?
It doesn't matter which you are in favor of, Segwit+increase or unlimited, but we need to be specific about what we are talking about, lest we increase the level of confusion around here.

No, I get that. But even you must say past performance won't guarantee future, (which is not the same as the reference, I'll concede.)
Using your last point, established companies/technologies do not always remain so. And commonly don't in new and emerging sectors. Those sort of somewhat fast-moving changes aren't going to give your TA enough time to advise you of the situation. Your examples seem pretty optimistic. How heavily do you weigh the risks? Which are the most concerning to you, curious?

You guys meme so hard it's disgusting. All you're doing is trying to convince people not to sell so the price doesn't go down further. If people don't sell, you can't buy at these discount prices.

@_date: 2018-06-11 18:25:36
..that doesn't necessarily make it correct, or even good logic. There are always opposites for proverbs. eg: "Opposites attract" vs. "Birds of a feather fly together".
The opposing thought to your proverb would be how it requires doing something for a long time to reach 'expert' level. That requires repetition. Sure there are some outliers and savants that don't need all that experience, but not the majority.
Otherwise people who exercise or work out must be either insane or wasting their time?
So yes, doing something over and over by design will produce different results each time. Usually more subtle when viewed at a glance, but over time the difference becomes more noticeable.

To be honest that may cause a cascading effect. If other miners on BTC switch to BCH to protect their hashing on BCH chain, hashrate on BTC decreases while increases on BCH. Until someone backs off it could end up proving to be more profitable on BCH if the price follows suit. Miners are primarily profit-oriented, but not only.
@_date: 2015-08-01 01:17:10
Luckily bitcoin doesn't have that problem as there isn't an argument in the world aside from ubiquity you can make that bitcoin doesn't move money far better.

There's a lot of potential reasons why he has never come forward or moved the coins. My favorite is because he didn't create bitcoin to profit off of. It kind of goes against the core ethos of why he did it. 
He's likely someone still working in crypto either chuckling to himself about our squabbles, or furiously enraged by them. Shit, some of us could even have talked or worked with him and would never now it.

Moreover, miner fee is literally the only incentive (aside from security of network) after the last block has been mined.

I thought segwit2x was an agreement (or consensus if you will) that people agreed to. The idea being if they're going to allow segwit to be activated, it would be on the condition that there would be a blocksize increase as well. No blocksize increase, no segwit. This was agreed upon, and now since core devs will not increase the blocksize, they need to do so with bitcoin2x. Why are people pushing the idea that it is some kind of scam? 
Seems disingenuous to me, at best.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:05:29
Same way you can buy and run a miner if you wish. Although it isn't generally economically feasible for most people to do so, same with sidechains...

If bch is going to fail, let it. What do you seriously have to worry about that you spend so much time being negative? It's not good for you..

@_date: 2018-07-16 03:57:23
Well a sub is made up by it's people. And if the people are de-facto chosen by segregation of discussion then you will ultimately end up with people that end up parroting an idea. Sentiments can change easier with more free discourse, but it isn't an immediate thing. Echo chambers form when variant conversation is eliminated completely. 
I say this *every* time I have one of these talks, and I'm sure I've had one with you. Stop this bullshit attacking. I say this in both subs, but I'm more concerned with the price and adoption to care, to be honest. I am not against Bitcoin, it's why I still try to stay unbanned from here, afterall. 
Let's just calm it down a bit, eh?

This was nice, though.


I do find it interesting in light of companies like RJ Reynolds et al. *currently* trying to get flavors other than tobacco and menthol banned in e-liquid. Which is bonkers.

"Bitcoin node refers to a "full" client. A "full" client is a client that owns the block chain and that is sharing blocks and transaction across the network. In opposite a Lightweight client can not be considered as a node because he doesn't share the block chain with the network"
Are you referring to mining? Mining and nodes are different.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:45:27
Right. And core devs didn't even attend or vote, despite being invited. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:00:43
Any way you could be a little bit more vitriolic?
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:35:15
That's silly, and it highlights the importance of having open collaboration. That includes ideas that challenge status quo. The implementation can't speak for the idea if the execution is flawed. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:59:27
The devs were invited. Their argument is that they already decided not to increase the blocksize, there was no input to be made and they were not moving from that decision. Okay, whatever, can't do anything about it but that perspective should at least concern progress...
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:22:13
mhmm, and a price rally up a couple thousand would surely do that. Along with a futures market to further coerce/manipulate with.

@_date: 2018-04-28 00:54:22
BCH is not Ver's. Even though he may be an obviously large proponent of the platform he doesn't speak for the users and definitely not the devs. I kind of think it's why Greg doesn't dev for core anymore, he was too vocal politically. Anyway, you and I can agree that Roger prematurely calling BCH Bitcoin is no good, and TBH, isn't good for BCH either. That's why I always push against people shitting on other coins or forks. 
Push your viewpoint forward, and maybe the other one won't matter any more. We can both share this philosophy. :D

@_date: 2018-04-27 21:45:56
Great question. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:41:31
Don't those coins become tainted after segwit data is added to it and then not able to be propagated by non-segwit nodes?
@_date: 2017-05-09 23:29:15
Yeah, then it jumped up to like 30 and dropped back down again almost immediately. I was like it isn't going to get that high again anytime soon...
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:14:24
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:36:06
I get your point, but it isn't exactly the same thing. You could say BCH is a hobby or project of yours without claiming to have created it. To call it your creation offers no nuance and is a directly false statement. The other is arguable.
No, that second bit is demonstratively false. They may have pushed for it strongly and advocated it, as Roger has, and quite possibly influenced some decisions. But they most certainly were not founded by Jihan or Bitmain or Roger. BCH has a robust team of developers that don't always agree, and aren't all from the same camp. BCH began it's path with * ABC, unlimited, XT and later on, separately, 2x. Segwit 2x was an offer made by a bunch of people who were advocating for a larger blocksize, voted on it (even invited core to vote, who declined) and agreed to segwit only under the condition that we would expand the blocksize. Bit the bullet and took segwit, but it was made apparent Lightning would be after segwit, not a blocksize increase. So it died on the table trying to be a separate coin instead of just an upgrade to the existing chain. Now it's just a constant stream of hate-spewing and character destruction. It makes both sides look stupid.
 - It's actually relatively non-biased.
@_date: 2015-03-12 02:25:13

@_date: 2019-05-20 23:29:40
How is it a problem that they support forked coins? Are like a lot of people getting confused? I haven't heard anyone who actually lost money because they bought the wrong coin..
Bitcoin's value is in its usefulness. It is meant to divest us from banks. If you say Coinbase (an exchange) is a bank, then you must also say that bitfinex, kraken, binance, etc are also banks. They all support forked coins, so why hate on Coinbase?
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:17:40

Hmm that sounds a lot like unproven accusations.
@_date: 2013-10-03 13:48:48
This is how LE usually works isn't it? They find their information out through some channel. But for whatever reason, they can't say they used that source. Could be they can still use it and are so, could be the access was not legal for them to do, could be it exposes some sort of target-able loophole. So the explanation we get is that he outed himself early on and that this is the *only* method used to discover. To say that we should assume the services are safe until given a reason not to seems a little naive, especially considering who we're talking about and the range of their actual intent.
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:04:26
The fact that they felt buying up a bitcoin-related business would boost interest in stock price is pretty good I guess.

Like I said before, noone says anything: regulation anyways, too bad.
If we have people actively saying things when regulation is talked about: regulation, but not as bad as it could be.
I'm not pro regulation or anything specifically, its just that I understand certain aspects of bitcoin are going to be regulated regardless of what you or I (or more important people) say. Might as well be on our terms =/
@_date: 2013-10-06 19:31:21
Well, yeah I know. It just opens the greater possibility of owning a part of something if you can divide it up many times. Moreso than just bitcoin itself, because these can represent real-world objects in addition to digital ones. You could see games use colored coins as a form of DRM. etc.

They meant whale as in someone who controls a lot of an asset, in this case bitcoin.
Unless you were being facetious..
@_date: 2013-10-08 02:13:36
I'm firmly in your camp. I feel as though they are treating it more similar to when they bust up a large drug operation, and all involved are guilty, instead of like with Megaupload, where some people affected actually work for the US Government and not all of the goings on were illegal.
e: Also, I feel if the issue was taken a little bit more seriously and actually hashed out, there could be  a precedent to set by this as a win, not a loss.
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:32:17
Yeah, can you say honeypot? Anyone have an idea how much btc was stored on their servers at the time of closure?
@_date: 2013-09-30 07:01:30
they're both stupid.
@_date: 2013-07-26 14:49:11
Well they do, its just I don't think for that purpose. At my location for example (chain pharmacy) we use internet to process insurance claims, credit cards, (not open i-net I'm sure) muzak, to connect to corporate, etc. They could probably implement it, but especially being a chain they are usually on the slow side, unfortunately. This could be a good thing though if bitcoin grows in popularity and more small, local businesses start using it. It could eat away some of the profits of the larger chain stores, which is IMO a good thing.
e: Although they might be able to do something with the 'foreign tender' payment options, it would still require a revamp of the POS. Then you have to consider do they take the price right then? Do they conduct all transactions at the price of BTC at the beginning of the day? etc.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:49:51
Also it's extremely trackable. It is also very possible to have a high degree of anonymity, but all transactions are verifiable. This is where bitcoin gets much of its value.
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:21:50

Is there a way for me (knowing the pass phrase, and the intermediate) to know/decrypt the private key without removing the hologram? Maybe can you have the math-technical dev to explain also?

@_date: 2013-08-18 04:06:10
You aren't going to get anything as publicly adopted as bitcoin needs to be by giving the media plenty of ways to paint it in a bad light. Don't feed the trolls right? They jump on that sort of stuff, and a lot of people watch and share the viewpoints they watch. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:27:07

Besides what that guy said, eventually there won't be as many bitcoins. In fact I read an article recently that said something to the effect that there has been so much hashing power now, and there will be soon in the future that there will be more coins paid out in this period of time (say 5-10 years) than was expected, or planned for. It also said that in the end it would likely even out but it's curious to see what sort of effect it will have.

@_date: 2013-07-21 02:19:58
He's right though with the first point. You aren't seeing the likes of Visa and MasterCard riling up *yet*. But you can bet your sweet ass they are going to be on btc's case once bitcoin is easier to accept for not just the average business, but importantly the chain stores. (talking just brick-and-mortar here) I think it comes down to major retailers seeing btc in enough abundance to consider the cost of updating their systems and infrastructure to support it. I mean it's just another currency, but do you go to Wal-Mart and pay with euro's? Or god forbid, Canadian money? So retailers need to see a reasonable demand before they even consider the idea.
Once they do however, the fact that the fees for transmission are basically already paid for by owning an internet connection will be very attractive indeed. To all sides.

Do you use bitcoin to the full extent its anonymity affords? Cash exchange, no purchases to home, encrypted connection for transfers, avoiding repetitive patterns of behavior, new addresses for every transaction, etc? Otherwise practices will be adopted (likely already are on their way) that will mechanize your ass right out of that public blockchain.
@_date: 2013-09-21 07:52:12
Right so the underlying layer isn't a typical private key like in current card designs, but an amalgamation of the pass and the actual private key? Then it uses the pass and the underlying combination to determine the actual private key.

I think too, a lot of people instantly think of it as though you were sending a file as opposed to simply changing the owner of said amount of coins.

@_date: 2013-10-31 16:35:15
The implication was that I didn't have business being involved in bitcoin because of my ignorance on a particular subject relating to it, which is dead wrong. That kind of attitude doesn't help adoption at all.
Arguing about the holes in the protocol here does no good, if you really are concerned about it the place for discussion is elsewhere. As I said earlier though, the point would be moot with mixing options anyways. There are always going to be ways your information will be able to be exposed, most of the time they will be stopped ahead of time, but otherwise all you can do is ensure you take proper precaution.

Perhaps along this route, maybe finding a seller directly. Find someone who is willing to sell their house via Bitcoin, or convince them too.

Just ideas, may be difficult depending on location and etc.

I don't believe you are thinking about this with the scope that Bitcoin is. You say:


In 10 years, do you think there is going to be a point during the day that you aren't able to be connected (with something probably a lot smaller than your cellphone is.)
Seems like a minor issue, but when you don't consider future in your scope and only look at things as they are now it's really just not effective. For you, or discourse.

Well really if you want all of people using bitcoin (a good goal imo, but far-out) then that means *everyone* is using it. What you are concerned about really is the timing of the bankers getting in on bitcoin. I do feel there's some concern there as they hold good sway with government and lobbying, yatta yatta. But simply because they disagree with your philosophy is not a good reason for them to not use bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-05 20:23:55
I meant more like now that we have a large influx of people who are hearing about it for the first time in-depth through their normal news outlets, the tech-savvy who are more likely to want to use this don't have one of the main informational sources about bitcoin.

I think the factor is the perceived value by the retailers that are buying it.
This actually hit home, because I work in a retail setting (rural/suburban) and had someone double-fist six Tide 100 oz. out the door not 2 days ago. (last time was about ~4 months ago.) Finally I have a reason for the otherwise inexplicable action. I figured they were just using it.

I think its funny how people were saying how unprofitable mining was until the price jacked up. It's deflationary in nature so it should go to say that if the price of bitcoin increases (and continues to do so) after you purchase a miner, it will be profitable.

I think the major issue with B &amp; M businesses accepting it is that they mostly don't access the open internet for transactions the way bitcoin does. They access specific credit card processing servers and the like. (My understanding is likely an order of magnitude off). The companies controlling these servers are vicious, and I don't foresee an easy way for the btc newtwork to access them.

Well yes and no. No mostly because of the limited current options.
Yes because while you might say that even if it becomes more widespread, people will want to hold onto it due to the volatility. But I can imagine a situation where, knowing the current price and recent fluctuations or perhaps what average rate I converted my current holdings at, I can make a choice to spend either one currency or another, creating an increased incentive to have some bitcoin but also to spend it.

Active collusion with law enforcement? What? He posted that he expected DPR to be arrested eventually based on his false sense of security surrounding his anonymity. [re: Mike Hearn]
I don't think Dark Wallet really needs to be taking such an aggressive stance against the foundation. They serve different interests. Dark Wallet has absolutely nothing to do with trading physical or digital money for bitcoin. If bitcoin doesn't have a voice at the table when regulation is discussed, and you know its going to be, then we lose all hope of minimizing the amount of trouble to get bitcoins. There's no doubt about it; the government really has no way to stop anybody from sending bitcoin to someone else. What they can do though is make it hard for individuals to get bitcoin, and hard for businesses to allow people to do so.
That being said, Dark Wallet seems like it fulfills a different purpose, and well. It increases the potential anonymity that bitcoin offers. Sure your exchange of USD into bitcoin may be monitored but if you can mix that anyways, it really doesn't matter.

@_date: 2013-04-10 05:30:01
I think there are a couple solutions which tackle your point. One of them being giving names and transfers to smaller denominations like the c and m bitcoin. Now that the price is ~150 (but varying accordingly with an omgsellnow phase) how does that change how much something that was being sold previously for? Do retailers need to adjust their prices daily to reflect current bitcoin trends? They aren't going to want to do that.. 
Another thread around here talks about having a value that takes into consideration how much the current fiat transfer would be, and just using a price reflected from that. Someone talks about giving more words to smaller denominations and having things trading in m and c bitcoins, but again the prices would be needing to update almost constantly.
I'm not proposing something here, but there needs to be I think an anchor of some sort. Not something that is built into the system but arises intrinsically from the interaction between merchants and buyers.

That's because the example given wasn't one appropriated for your day-to-day life. It was one of an ecosystem of constantly increasing rates as a result of this sort of activity.

Well shit i wouldn't call $100,000 rich... I mean it's a good amount of money, for sure. But not rich really.
Well shit though man with your example, what's to stop the same man from demanding Henk to access his safety deposit box that contains $100,000 in $20 dollar bills via the same method(s)? Now he's got a whole shitload of 20's, arguably more labor-intensive than a single bitcoin wallet I'll give you that. I'm sure Henk didn't happen to write the serial numbers for all those bills down. They aren't traceable. At least bitcoin has the blockchain. (but that's a different convo)

I don't believe a CTR is needed unless it is in excess of $10,000. The rest of the information would be collected though, yes. SSN only up to a certain dollar amount. Also sometimes you may need to provide job title.
Also an MSB is obligated to fill out an SAR if they feel the transaction is suspicious, and the sender can't be let known.

Yep, I was on here last night even talking about stuff and somehow never even saw this going on =/ Theres other ways to earn bitcoins. You can also 'mine' for bitcoins using your cpu or gpu. When bitcoin was first created, solving an entire block net you 50btc. Not sure what that value is currently, but its kind of time-consuming to solve a block on your own. There are websites that distribute across a wide number of people and when the block is solved, the prize is split among the people who helped solve it.
@_date: 2013-09-29 03:00:42
I would assume from the issuer. If we use stocks as an example, this one person issues out colored coins  that represent shares of their stock. When the person would redeem them from the issuer, the issuer would transfer the straight btc to them at the current rate in exchange for those colored coins back. 
If we're talking physical commodities, then I think when you buy a colored coin for say, gold, from somebody, that person would have to have gotten it from the person who actually had the physical gold in their possession. You would receive the gold from them. How this will work without an escrow I have no idea.
There is a chance my understanding is flawed up to a level of 95%.

The issue of a chargeback really doesn't even matter unless you are talking about an untrusted party, or an unfulfilled transaction.

Well, honestly I was mainly thinking about the different investing opportunities that will either run their course or adapt and switch gears. There is a LOT of btc tied up in trading that will be 'let loose' as mining and hardware themselves become much less profitable. 
Then again, will this loss of profitability similarly cause an increase in price of bitcoin to compensate? Are mining profit, and eventually tx fees, the real determining factor in price of bitcoin (obviously affected heavily by speculation) or is it something else? I'm pretty sure there will be a futures market for the price of bitcoin soon. Who knows?

A good analogy actually, but not so for the future of bitcoin to be used in the same way. Gold has a value that fluctuates as does bitcoin. Difference being, people don't use gold to purchase things in most instances. I feel for it to be successful it has to be stable like currency so that it is easily adoptable, but also needs to have that same aspect gold does, as a store of wealth.
Mainly right now the long-term problem I see with bitcoin's staying power is its stability and how that affects adoption.

Not sure why you got to 0 from that. I think it was a decently thought out post, whether or not someone agrees to it or not (is this not the basis of reddit voting?) 
I personally think that money and wealth are terrible things especially considering how much worth people attribute to it who don't really know what they're even giving worth to. The more things that become monetized, the more things you'll have to pay for. It really is a system that only benefits the people with it.

It isn't just Wikipedia. Bitcoin is starting to grab the attention of more audiences. I think a big interest spike is coming up. looks like it's gotten 3k subs in the last week or so. My friend caught the Norwegian man story on his local news (US), not that long after bitcoin news sources ran it. Also the fact that it's remained relatively stable after the last price increase. That stability and how it's different than the $240 spike is only going to reinforce confidence in new adopters and potentials.

lol, I'm not sure how you think you have any idea about my viewpoints on really anything, but I never mentioned that I agreed that it took making bitcoin illegal for it to launch in value. I'm confident that the value of bitcoin will be very much higher than it is today, but for other reasons. I think $600k is a little much, that's why I read it as sarcasm. You can't say that in 80 years the value of the dollar won't have depreciated, and the value of bitcoin won't increase to the point where $600k actually could get one bitcoin. But not anytime soon.

Likely when converting USD -&gt; bitcoin, you will have to wait at least 10 minutes to *spend* it from the address. You have no need to wait there.
@_date: 2013-08-18 04:50:28
Which really makes it fishy that they are no longer taking pay pal. I mean, okay its pay pal, its likely just be a coincidence, but still.. Are they doing this to purposefully abuse the non charge-back nature of bitcoin..?
@_date: 2013-11-01 03:42:34
Does that happen? I mean with the cross-site captcha input that is.
@_date: 2013-10-03 16:40:15
Err, what?
e: ahh okay, didn't appreciate the sarcasm at first.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:42:24
Perhaps take how much the item would be worth in the current most popular currency, take the conversion from btc&gt;that and then that&gt;item, and value it on the fly when the person completes the transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:06:49
You don't lose until you sell lower than you bought. Other than that it's a waiting game. How long did we have to wait from 240? I don't think it will be like that..
@_date: 2013-10-25 23:53:17
Just you. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:37:25
Right, just that they can't expect their bank to do the currency exchange for them.
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:34:21
No, but its definitely a helpful resource and one a lot of established channels use predominantly.

Yeah well my trillion dollar coin isn't taxable so eat it, Sam!

You could try bitfantasy.com, although you have to pay .02btc for public beta.

.. without representation, or just in general?

Doesn't even appear to be requesting the user to click on a link.. it suggests (to me at least) that the user log on to mtgox and withdraw if they wanted it before 10/26. 
Seems a little short notice though.

Kind of, but the retailers are going to be the ones who move more, first.
Bitcoin can not do about the same thing as fiat, however. To transfer fiat in the amounts you can bitcoin is much slower, much more expensive and much more limited in range. The reason that people are interested in bitcoin *now*, when there will be more ways to spend it in the future is because early adopters are meant to be at an advantage. It encourages more people to use it sooner so that there will be infrastructure for it down the road.

Any amount of money is pocket change to someone with more.

The only thread of an example for that would be when he said that by making completely false, defamatory remarks about somebody you are opening yourself up to potential legal action from them.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:49:35
Right? he's like I have 69000 bitcoins, I've put in $900 on this crap, fuck it.
~2 years later......

Well there's but that seems to be specifically WTS/WTB not useful for larger scale retailers. They should be able to get their questions answered fairly quickly at bit I agree a separate sub for businesses would be nice. Then any new business that accepts btc can announce it there, and there could be links and etc. for specific info for retailers.
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:08:31
..pretty sure they only posted this time because the other person posted the suggestion last time.

Typically businesses that are showing profit are considered to be "in the black" and poor performers would be in the red. Historically the day after thanksgiving showed many businesses returning better profits and came to be known as black friday.

Do they have a phone number? I would try that also..

And seriously, you're suggesting martingale as though noone's heard of it before?

Great way to kill any bitcoin-related business whatsoever for the businesses that register..
@_date: 2013-08-17 14:08:47
Right and the key point here being income. If I exchange a certain amount of USD into bitcoin but never convert any bitcoin into USD, you can't say that I've made a profit at that point, no matter how much bitcoin I have.
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:44:45
You can borrow bitcoin to short at  also, right?
@_date: 2013-12-28 14:37:09
Yeah, I don't exactly disagree with you here. Bankers bring a moderate amount of stability, but I'd rather live without the caveats.

I'm not saying anything about that. But when I looked at it, the post you linked to was posted *after* this one here I replied to.
e: Still is, this one says 18 hours ago, the other one says 12 hours ago...

nice, congrats
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:52:00
might that work?

If you're talking about the character on the right, that's an e-cig.

This is the distribution issue.
How can we get those fractions of 21 million bitcoins distributed so it isn't just the innovators and early adopters having/spending? Paychecks are probably going to be a big addition. I think we're going to see a lot of people looking for service, product, and exchange on a person-to-person basis, and bitcoin will help here too. Remittances, even gambling; these are what is going to bring in bigger numbers and distribution, I think.

My guess is the same thing they do in every situation where funds are seized that were used for illegal purposes. Thing is, they can't exactly prove that all the funds on the website were used or even intended for use for illegal items. Perhaps the merchant accounts, but the user accounts should not have their funds locked.

I think a more valid analogy would be diamond. It feels much more artificial, in regards to control of quantity (there are vast more sums of diamonds than currently marketable.)
