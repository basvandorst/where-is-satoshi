Many bitcoin businesses are also located outside of the US.

This is true. Coinye...

Wow. I'd rather do business with an anonymous dealer on LocalBitcoins than have a machine scan biometric data on me.

It's hard for a company (particularly a company selling goods and not services) to stay totally out of fiat. It's unrealistic to expect most companies to not cash out a portion of their BTC to do business. Bitcoin Video Casino stays all in Bitcoin and pays out all expenses in Bitcoin, and I suspect other gambling sites do also. However, we can do that because there are advertising platforms and hosting companies that accept BTC.

Tradefortress PMed us months ago offering 50 BTC to integrate our casino with Inputs.io exclusively. We didn't like the security of the wallet, and turned him down. We're really happy we did.

Bitcoin would be amazing for travelers once adoption becomes more widespread. No exchange fees, they can't be pick pocketed, no worrying about exchange rates...

Psychologically customers like to see a lot of merchandise in retail environments, so doing small production runs might not be your best option. If you have more to sell, you sell more. I would peg your prices to USD and keep a portion of your capital in fiat to counter the volatility.
