Thank you for making my point, the rich will always be in control no matter what the system.

What annoys me the most about this discussion is you can argue all you want that Bitcoin is decentralized but in reality how decentralized is it? 
* The core git is controlled by a few, you could argue that people will switch if they do something stupid but will they? Will the general consumer have any idea which chain to use? No they just want it to work.
* The main discussion forums are controlled by one person.
Yes the technology is decentralized but at the moment what's happening right now is no different to what the Banks are doing.

Further mining is getting extremely centralised, I'm willing to bet that the are less miners in the world who control majority of bitcoins power then there are central banks in the world. In fact, if you consider some points being made here Bitcoin is more centralized then the worlds general money supply.

Here is the issue: the general consumer won't switch because they just want it to work so in effect if you control the repos you control Bitcoin. I love the Blockchain but Bitcoin is effectively becoming more and more like the banks it was trying to replace.

Martyr for what exactly?

Well actually recently the UK government ranked Bitcoin as low risk for money laundering. Further, HMRC regulation concerning bitcoin has been more than fair.

Everytime this is bought up I don't understand the cricle jerk around this criminal. Why is he any better than the other criminal that we distance ourselves from? You can say whatever you want about the war on drugs but Silkroad wasn't just that. Also there is a difference between smoking it and facilitating an enormous international trade of the substance(s).

It might be morally wrong to put people in jail for drugs but at the end of the day as it stands he broke the current law and he should take full responsibility for his actions.

Considering he ran one of the biggest underground marketplaces I see it as fair.
