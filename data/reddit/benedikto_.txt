Can you transfer Bitcoins from coinbase to a nano Ledger s?

Airbnb is illegal in Quebec City and there are over five thousand of them.  They can't enforce it.

And private prison, I heard this is going very well.

Oh I thought the wallet contained an app.  So it s like an authenticator.

We just ignore the law and they don't enforce it.

Just wanted to let you know that Airbnb is not legal in Quebec. There are currently over 5,000 Airbnbs in Quebec City. Hopefully people will ignore the ban and conduct business as usual.

Hindsight.  Bla bla bla.  Buy now, it will reach 10k by the end of 2018
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:33:23
I agree.  That's why there are Bitcoin wallets

Been an AirBnB host for a year and a half now.  I will think about it.
@_date: 2017-09-23 01:54:37
Yeah, people mentioned that they can block certain areas of uber.
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:32:43
Thank you. And what do you consider a large sum?
@_date: 2017-09-24 17:22:59
And New York, and British Columbia, etc.
