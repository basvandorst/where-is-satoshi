How are you planning to recover them? I had a hard drive die shortly after being partially encrypted by ransomware that might have had some bitcoins I minded on it. I pulled up the files using some rescue cd years ago but I wasn't thinking about bitcoin at the time.

Or you're just a procrastinating fuck stick who never got around to trying to get those files off that failing hard drive that was partially encrypted by ransomware... Or something like that.

I wanted to do that a couple years ago but couldn't get past the possibility of someone finding an old bitcoin wallet on the drive and getting greedy. I honestly wouldn't blame them but...
I did pull the files up once shortly after the drive died using a rescue cd so I'll probably just try that again.

I have a hard drive that shit the bed in 2012-13 shortly after being infected by ransomware. I hadn't bought any bitcoin at that point but I did mine for a bit after hearing about bitcoin on a podcast. I don't know if I found any blocks though. I could turn up with nothing because the wallet files were encrypted by some fuckheads I probably couldn't pay at this point if I wanted to. It could be nothing because I didn't find any blocks. Or the hard drive could be totally fucked. Alternatively, I could have millions of dollars just waiting for me in my mother's basement. It's a *little* stressful.

Fewer people would think it's a good idea to throw their heads up against the brick wall that is our military if we weren't fucking with their daily lives.

Use a randomly generated password from lastpass. It's a bit harder to phish someone when they don't actually know their password.

I''m glad I've only been *looking* into making an account with them. Wouldn't want to lose my 0.0002 BTC war chest.  
Would using an old PC with tails installed be overkill for a cold storage wallet?
