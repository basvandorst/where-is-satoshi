I'll give it a shot. Sounds like what I want

UPDATE: sorry for trying to warn others about a website that takes a week to ship and lies about it. It's relevant to this sub because no one's really using the site if they don't accept BTC. I tried it without it but I don't think that makes a difference to their website being bad (in other words don't spend your BTC there was my helpful message)
And I like how someone wants to put me down for a drug-related post on here even though bitcoin is shit without a drug market supporting it. Have fun thinking a glorified stock will ever replace money.

I'll check that out
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:50:24
Porn; that's all I needed to know. Thank you
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:05:09
no, it's just sketchy now after the ddos attack. Some can log in, some can't. Random payouts, depositing sometimes doesn't work. Done with that site
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:22:17
I think you need a bank account backed up to the card for both of those. And what Shrem got arrested for didn't have to do with the service itself.
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:08:13
I just explained the timeline. It takes 5 minutes to cash a money order (not that they need to before shipping it anyway). I wouldn't be as upset if they didn't email me saying they're send me a tracking number by 5 pm Friday...not seeing how I'm in the wrong here
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:07:20
you talk to your dad like that?
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:10:18
Did you not read the part of them saying when they'd ship and then not shipping it
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:20:32
I don't get why they don't have a card that works as a wallet, and you can load funds at a local gas station like a visa prepaid. It seems like a simple concept.
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:10:24
well people carrying around 1000BTC, that's not for them. For people who just hold enough for small purchases I feel like a refillable card fits them well. It's up to them to be safe with it.
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:05:40
it wasn't before
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:08:38
I couldn't find that way out but upon trying to I discovered cashintocoins.com, which I'll probably use primarily in the future.
@_date: 2014-04-01 22:28:21
did you miss the part where they said when they'd ship? and here's my updated post in a different subreddit 
So the website you defend so honorably just stole my money, but I'm a 5 year old for getting upset that they didn't care about my order.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:09:36
this sucks, but I'm glad someone else is experiencing this. Shit needs to go back on before the Clippers game!
@_date: 2014-03-05 13:10:00
Wow, and I just found out I can't withdraw 
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:06:10
yeah I'm using that now, good read too
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:47:52
oh shit, thanks man
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:57:32
a lot of you are giving things you can do with bitcoins that aren't illegal, but not how that benefits more than using regular money
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:12:00
This is a really old thread, you should start a new one for that question if you want answers
@_date: 2014-02-14 18:33:22
Yes, I use Silk Road. I don't see how that's relevant to trying to buy bitcoins with the nearest bank to me. And I'm 17 so a fake ID is simply to buy wraps. I'm SO sorry for inconveniencing you to click on this and post a comment. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:39:13
when I'm rich one day, I'll remember you.
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:42:39
Once again; what are the uses for bitcoin that aren't illegal purposes, as I'm curious myself.
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:09:01
"They apologized and said they'll throw in a free bowl, and that I will receive a tracking number by 5pm Friday (that day)."
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:38:52
haha good point. Well really this'll be my first time betting and I don't get paid for another week, so I'm just trying to play around with the little BTC I have left
@_date: 2014-02-14 18:28:39
Update everyone: I was able to find another listing. And I didn't think there would be any valuable information in a localbitcoins.com account to be honest. Sorry for coming off as a scammer, even though I have no idea how I'd be able to scam in that situation.
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:05:30
"most popular online head shop that accepts BTC" Not sure where else it belongs
@_date: 2014-05-09 01:13:31
I've been at Nitrogen.eu since I made this thread and have been extremely happy ever since
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:38:29
my real question is what are the uses for bitcoin that aren't illegal purposes, as I'm curious myself.
@_date: 2014-02-14 18:29:40
Yeah, it'll take a while. I'm not blessed with much money
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:37:24
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:25:23
yeah but anyone who gets a hold of any credit/debit card can use the funds. Same risk as a bank account, and in my opinion worth it
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:09:52
wow I'm dumb for that. Also just discovered 
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:08:12
that's all you could have said from the beginning

I love BTC as much as the next person, but a car will cost me $10,000. In a week it'll still cost $10,000. This is why bitcoin will never be able to fully take over money.
