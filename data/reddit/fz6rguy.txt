That would be easiest and give you the lowest transaction fees

The first bitcoin to bitcoin home sale recently happened 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:33:40
 I withdrew ETH from Gdax to Bittrex yesterday and it went through after like 6 hours.

My condolences for your loss, my father passed last month  and keeping everything with life going while going through this is not easy. There are a lot people with way more helpful advice on this sub than I can provide so I will leave the experts to that. I hope you find good results on your Bitcoin wallet!  
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:09:34
What site did you use to purchase the bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:07:35
I could be wrong but I think you only need to be verified on Coinbase if you are buying or selling crypto currently but don’t need to be verified to send or receive funds.

Which skyrockets the price of BCH and they stop all BCH trading on Gdax

Hell yeah brother

This is the modern age dot com boom, hopefully without the bubble aspect.

I am a  newbie ��

You can no fee limit buy/sell on Gdax.com
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:04:29
It takes a few hours for something to show up, I’ve even had it take a few days 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:40:42
I tried to sell but those fuckers cancelled my order and now the price has dropped back down
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:06:43
I’m hoping it starts going up quickly. The previous dips took about 2 years to correct 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:46:00
And the price dropped back to $3,209. I feel sorry for anyone who bought at $8,500

Tell your mom to stop using her coinbase account to buy drugs 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:18:49
I tried to dump at $8500/BCH but Gdax cancelled my sell order
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:53:25
I do it all the time, Gdax is owned by coinbase. Now will bitcoin actually hit $11k? Well honestly I hope not

Sub saves noob from poor financial decision by resisting urge to give basic knowledge of trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:59:05
Send it to Gdax and do a free trade limit sale, then limit buy some bitcoin with the money while bitcoins still on sale
