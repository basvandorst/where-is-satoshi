By replacing POW with DPOS, 
1) BitShares effectively made a blockchain system less centralized (i.e. mining cartels), 
2) BitShares made it faster (i.e. 5 second transactions, 10 second blocks), 
3) BitShares made it capable of being profitable 
     3a)i.e. minimal costs to secure - delegates have negligible overhead compared to the $700 million Bitcoin pays
     3b) block chain based trading platform which generates revenue
4) BitShares created bit assets which are the first true "digital currency" (i.e. no volatility compared to an assets real world counterpart)
     4a) gives digital currency real word retail and b2b potential
5)  BitShares has opened the discussion for changing the metaphors, which Bitcoin got wrong
     5a) bitcoin and alts are not "digital currencies" but actually digital equities
    5b) bit assets are more like currencies but with revenue sharing programs
     5c) BitShares is a business, so is Bitcoin, but BitShares is profitable and Bitcoin is not and so will die a slow death while people realize BitShares is the holy grail of digital commerce and economics

"The problem is the economic the reword for securing the network goes to the money managers, not the people investing, working and building the real economy."
Trust me, giving money to miners is not reinvesting in people building the economy.  
Now to get you straight - the transactions fees will overtime be 99.999% burned, which acts as a dividend which goes straight into the community's pockets.  A single BitShare grows in value while a Bitcoin bleeds value every second you hold it
