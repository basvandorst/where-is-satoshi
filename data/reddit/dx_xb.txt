It's not that 3D printing isn't big. It is, but it is being hyped as the source of new progress, while it is only going to be a part of it. Cryptocurrencies are more important, as is the concept of open hardware. Open hardware was driving the development of 3D printing, not the other way around. 
3D printers are likely never going to be household items. They will be a tool in garages and the living rooms of inventors, hackers, makers and the lot. 
Industrial mass production is still cheaper to do in conventional ways. Prototyping, on the other hand, becomes very very cheap.

3D printing is overhyped. 
However, it is going to be an important part of the "new industrial revolution", as Chris Anderson (Wired, DiyDrones,..) calls it. Bitcoin, open source hardware like the Arduino and open source software will all increase the velocity of innovation.

I'm divided on this. We do have mixers, the coming Dark Wallet, the shared send and so on. Transparency for public addresses  might be a good thing.

From what I understand, implementing a mixing layer, like the zerocoin, on top of bitcoin, would inflate the blockchain, which is already growing very fast.
That was a valid reason for rejecting native mixing some time ago before zerocoin was reduced in size. Now, zerocoin is smaller, leaves smaller footprint on the blockchain, but perhaps it's still too big. I don't know.

I suggest trying for technical solutions, lots of programmers who understand the btc system.
I'm just brainstorming here, but i guess a menu with a QR code of the restaurant's address would be enough to enable smartphone payments for the customers. A register-side application could print out a receipt automatically upon receiving payment, so your staff doesn't have to learn much new things.
Since btc is rising in value, you could offer lower prices for btc payments. 
edit: Probably a good idea to make a smarthone webapp with the whole menu that shows btc price. 
I think your biggest problems will not be technical (you will probably be surprised at how easy it is to do business with btc), but legal, related to taxes and currency exchange. 
Hope everything goes well
Best of luck

That's a good point. I've seen estimates as low as 5-10% new businesses surviving in their first year, depending on country they are based in and, well, a bunch of other factors. 
The bitcoin economy is certainly not immune to that and it might take quite a while before "the speed of creation of successful new businesses"* surpasses btc inflation. My guess is from a few months to a year or two, but hell, that just a gut feeling.

There are two meanings to the term _inflation_. One means simply the increase in monetary mass (more money printed or mined), that is what I'm referring to. Every four years the daily amount of created btc halves, until 2140.
the other means the decrease in the purchasing power of money - things get more expensive. 
In the first sense, bitcoin is inflationary - more of it is created every day. In the second sense, it's already mostly deflationary (if you look at the trend) - since things are getting cheaper in terms of btc.

This. Ponzi.
I lost half of my funds on BTCjam, and I thought I invested safely. People I invested in usually had pretty high ratings. 
I read the other day something written by N. Taleb. According to him, loans in general are an inferior type of investment to, say, stocks, shares, options and the like. The best you can get with a loan is your money back with some interest (there is an upper limit); the worst is all your money lost. 
With stocks and shares he recommends a hyper-paranoid with hyper-aggressive strategy. Invest 90% in as-safe-as-possible place. Then divide the 10% to a wide array of very high-risk, high-return options. That way the worst that happens is you loose 10%, and are left with 90%; the best that happens is you have all your money and a &gt;1000% return on one of your high risk investments. 
I'm looking into  for investments.

It takes a lot of money to wage a war. 
Following bitcoin's large scale acceptance, and given the anonymity and it's cryptic nature, the IRS won't have much choice - they will have to get creative in taxing people.

Whichever way they choose, it will be practically impassible to finance both wars and the welfare state.

@_date: 2013-05-27 00:50:54
Exactly profit.
First, wars are costly. A corporation needs to make money, so a war is not very wished for.
Second, the workers are not fighters, they would need to pay someone to fight for them. Nation-states and religions have good "marketing" for persuading people to go to war. Not sure what corporations would have. That leaves a considerably small number of people willing to fight for money. 
Third - corporations are not near-self-sufficient entities like nation-states. They are too dependent on other corporations. If you're making Big Macs, you need to buy everything else for living buy selling Bic Macs. You can't survive without other corporations, workers and buyers.

If coins get lost, the value of the rest of the coins is increased by some amount. As I've seen it put - lost coins are a gift to the global economy.
The money supply was intended to be constant, it's not that an arbitrary cutoff was implemented, it's that it was chosen to get to the constant amount in a gradual way to make mining a part of the business, to reward the people who support the system by calculating hashes and maintain the blockchain.

Money is any object or record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given socio-economic context or country.[1][2][3] The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, occasionally in the past, a standard of deferred payment.[4][5] Any kind of object or secure verifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered money.

I am aware that a lot of people are against strict libertarianism and the free market. I think things might be changing. Perhaps mostly with the younger generation. These things change. A nation that had no taxes to speak of, that built a whole network of roads and railroads without taxes, had no federal 'safety', now has government spending on par with some socialist countries. 
I mean, perhaps the way to go is toward less spending. We could perhaps find a compromise on what exactly the government should do and how much it should spend. It's mostly a question of degrees, not absolutes.


I would prefer to pay for these things to the private sector, not to the government. I get a nice receipt, they treat me like a person, and I wish to do business again with them. They are also cheaper.


Well, sure. I didn't vote 5 years ago, but if I did, I would have voted for Obama. He seemed like a guy who would end those wars. I would prefer if he did not have the power (money) to start a war and keep it going without people's approval.

From 
*The most dangerous form of war finance is the printing of new paper money, resorted to when no more taxes can be collected and the government’s credit has broken down. Usually the printing is not done by the government directly but by the central bank, which then lends the printed money to the government through purchases of bonds.*
*Major wars are usually financed to some extent by inflationary measures. Inflation distributes the burden of war costs in an arbitrary manner, penalizing persons with fixed incomes. After a certain point, inflation may even lower production by placing a premium on the hoarding of raw materials and durable goods, as well as the holding of real estate and other fixed assets, thus shifting resources from productive to nonproductive uses.*
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:10:58
No, you are absolutely not morally obliged to "give something back". When you profit from something on a free market - someone gives you their money voluntarily because your product is valuable to him - you have given back. You have made the exchange with society, you have both made a profit.
Taxation is merely financing monopolies protected by the government.

So I guess, yeah, we are much better protected from crashes than two years ago because the companies realized the importance of computer security when dealing with people's money.
I predict the next crash (or a significant fall) will happen due to government meddling, making btc illegal or something like that. But then the people will riot and revolution will happen and it will not be televised and bla bla anarchy, austrians, gold, and The Diamond Age.

Technically, bitcoin is still an inflationary currency. Every day 3400 new bitcoins are created, and will be for the next 3 and a half years.

Obviously, you would need a security division to monitor your security, which you would pay from your pocket. Given the low efficacy of police, it might be cheaper and more secure to have an assortment (a system) of neighborhood-watch-type companies, security guards, follow-trough-guards.. If they turn out to be lousy, they loose reputation and less and less people hire them..

Let's put it sanely then: till the end of Obama's second term. 
(I've been listening to a lot of Schiff lately :/ )

You'll notice that inflation rate curves rise in an accelerating fashion. The governments print increasing amounts of money.
With bitcoin, the money supply is increasing in a decelerating fashion, you get less and less bitcoin.

Going with the simplest and most fundamental law of the market - the supply and demand one - there is more supply than demand.
First off, bitcoin is still an _inflationary_ currency. For the next three and a half years, there will be 3600 new bitcoins entering the market DAILY. If you check out the number of transactions on blockchain.info , it has doubled in the past year, but the price in dollars increased a bit more than double. 
Second, the bitcoin economy and the number of small businesses accepting btc increased, but the rate is apparently not fast enough to increase demand for new bitcoins. Judging by this subreddit, where practically all new businesses advertise, we won't have to wait long to see a large enough rise in demand (add into this SilkRoad traffic increase). 
So, I guess I'm saying that the price of btc is going down because there is still a relatively small demand for btc.

Right. You seemed like an ad-hominem guy from the start. 
How do you _know_ the Earth is in an "Easter Island" situation? 
We are actually discovering new resources too. A few hundred years ago, we had no oil, electricity, plastics, solar, nuclear, geothermal power.. 
In a dozen decades, we could probably tame thunderstorms and take energy from them, or volcanoes .. Then there's robots and AI. We're just beginning to find out how to make them. There is biothechnology potential to feed everyone for a fraction of price..

Nice article, thanks!

Ah, well, most instant rich people waste their money anyways. I hope at least some of these will invest it well. 
I mean, so what if they own a big percentage of the money supply?

Taleb's strategy is, as I understand it, to keep 90% of your portfolio in secure places (he mentions government securities for some reason) and invest 10% in a large number of high risk, high return options (like those pharma companies you mention). Most of those will flop, but  just one success is enough to return a hefty sum of money. Worked for him, anyway.
In the bitcoin economy.. I guess the strategy would be to hold on to 90% in a secure wallet, or something like that, and invest the 10% in a bunch of trash stocks, and then hope for one to succeed. 
He talks about using options as leverage. I'll have to look into those things.

Hope you found your way into bitfunder, but here's a link, just in case:  
Registration and setting up an account might take about half an hour, there is another site you need to register on, and there are money transfers to wait for.

Simply by expanding the base of users of btc, of people who except it for wages and trade. 
If a lot of people would think btc is better money than usd, then you get a large base of users.
