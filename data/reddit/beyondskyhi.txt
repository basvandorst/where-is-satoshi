The phrase I hear around here a few times.. "The ship has sailed" with the price soaring up its too late for me to find another exchange. That being said bitstamp treated me good. In a time sensitive environment like with btc this is unacceptable. To make it worst I had to wait a whole week before they told me my transaction was canceled. I trusted coinbase for my first big btc purchase and I got burned. Missed the boat. And on top of that I get responses from their automated too bad fck u bot.

I just checked your history, you should stop, instead.

Yeaahhhh go snoop. But avoid coinbase. They are nothing but trouble.

Thank you up vote for you... I'll check there.

I expected that of them. I never really condoned what they do, the shit they do. Its a new, exciting and dangerous time for bitcoin :)

I tried ordering 5 btc from them when the price was lower. They never gave me a proper response. Only automated sorry try again in a few weeks bullshit.
And it wasn't some 5 mini transactions at once. It was 1 big transaction for 5 btc. The only order I put on coinbase.

2x they gave me a automated sorry message. I'm using my right to complain. Not even the decency of having a live person type the response. No insight not even trying to resolve the matter. I say screw them I got some family and friends who are getting into btc and they sure aren't going to use coinbase.

Hello and thank you for contacting Coinbase Support!
I'm sorry to hear that your purchase was cancelled. 
All of the risk analysis of purchases is performed by our self-learning risk-detection algorithm. Because of its fluid nature, it is fairly impossible to predict how it will react on a given day. 
It is definitely not perfect, and does occasionally make mistakes. We are constantly tweaking the parameters to hopefully catch fewer legitimate customers along with the massive amount of scams it does successfully prevent on a daily basis.
The only advice I can give you is to verify as much information with the system as possible before making your purchases. That will definitely lower your risk-score generated by the algorithm. You can find a list of different verification methods if you go to Buy/Sell, and then to Limits and Verifications at the top of that screen. In particular, Identity verification and adding/verifying a Visa credit card can go a long ways. 
If you have multiple accounts, deleting the others and only using one can help significantly. Waiting a few days between purchase attempts can also help.
If you have verified as much information as you can, and believe you have been inappropriately flagged, don't hesitate to reply to us here at support We'll be happy to look into your case - thank you for your understanding in this matter.
No I'm not understanding the matter. He gave me a response with no intention of resolving this case. It doesn't help their verification system doesn't work when I gave it all my information I am from the USA so I thought it would of been much easier. I only want them to approve my original order and that is it.

At a 10x increased mark up? They admitted this fault was on their end. I just want to talk to a live support and get my order approved.

A few others with complaints on coinbase subreddit has had their orders resolved. They're a business I expect them to help me with an issue they caused.
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:34:50
I gave them a chance.. A few they never had the time of day to even personally respond to my messages. Automated we are sorry emails? What a joke. I must be the joke to them.
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:18:42
Yes it seems so.
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:24:38
Yeah if my sob story sways people away from coinbase, I don't mind. They better step up their game or lose in this race. Im airing out their dirty laundry because in a time sensitive place like btc this is ridiculous. Don't get burned like I did people. Look at other reputable ACTUAL exchanges.
