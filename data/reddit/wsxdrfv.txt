And if install bitcoin to linux os, if booting with windows 10 normally, bitcoin does not work on my machine?
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:40:00
Then how to compile it in linux?, How to install linux from computer booted as windows 10?

It means big hit. Cuz bitcoin price will rises continuously. If I need real money, then change a little bit of bitcoin to money and keep bitcoin like over 3 years. Then it will be maybe 100,000$

I think cloud mining is more good than buy hardware. Genesis is real. But sold out. So I want to know alternatives trustable. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:55:51
There I found interesting word. Pool owner also can take transaction fee? what this means? I saw wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:16:15
Pool can be trustable? What if that pool's admins deceives others and take more?
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:27:30
Genesis mining is said to trustable. isnt it?
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:28:11
are you sure? cloud mining also can be very profitable?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:50:00
So who is reseller? I assumed that true cloud mining site sell directly to public, not to resellers.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:19:47
How miners can know pool cheats?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:31:16
Actually you don't know thoroughly well about bitcoin's truth. If you know, you can't say that price will drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:31:23
thanks man, then only remaining is participating mining decision. I almost want to dive. So there are 2 options, buy cloud mining share, but legit cloud miners like genesis already sold out, so are there remaining legit cloud miners? 
Another option is, buy mining hardware and join pool. I know this is still profitable but antminer s9 price is already over 4500$. 
Just buying bitcoin is more profitable than buying 1~10 antminer s9?

And after that, his job is promote and advertise his crypto currency? Is it easy? How to?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:37:56
yes anyone can do it. Bitcoin source is opened. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:35:07
hm...so anyway, what else are true cloud mining  service other than genesis?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:42:20
I can't understand. Why suddenly 2500$ appear? They taken 1500$, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:01:11
Then how it works?
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:14:29
then normally small one pool has how many hardwares? Antminer S9? 
I heard that even one man can make one pool. How to do that? How many hardwares at least he should have to anticipate profitable pool? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:22:38
Then, pool admin can't deceive whether his pool succeeded mining or not? Everyone knows what pool take this 10 minutes coin?

But another problem. should I differentiate PUBKEY_ADDRESS and SCRIPT_ADDRESS for new coin? or can I neglect PUBKEY_ADDRESS and just change SCRIPT_ADDRESS is enough? or should change both same?
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:05:35
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:15:23
of course I posted there same question yesterday, but not yet answered. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:13:01
But eventually, so what script's what line (or variable name roughly) should I revise for change that '1' or '3' number to 'E' ? 
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:42:09

@_date: 2018-02-10 12:30:19
So I found this site, 
And base58 decode site, 
But both site, number '5' does not return '3'. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:41:32
Thanks, so where is value of that? The value should be '3' because all bitcoin address start with 3 (as far as I know).
So where is source code position that value is given as '3'?
Because I want to change it to another alphabet character.
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:45:56
So bitcoin uses its own change logic. 
So 'E' is '33' in this case.
