Don't worry, plenty of greedy slaves like yourself willing to sell their souls to keep the inflationary layer going for a long time. Greedy discretionary spending purchases for all ! For the smart ones who seek growth, there is Bitcoin. And with the future economy in the hands of the smart ones, the economy will be looking good and automated and lovely!

Users decide wallet and should choose wallets that support bitcoin. If you aren't running your own bitcoin node/wallet, the wallet you use should have the option to send/read lightning transactions and see associated fees.

Probably try other wallets, or other lightning nodes. If you open a channel directly to them you should be able to transfer whatever amount (I think)
This lightning wallet probably has to open a channel to the other party, and keeps their amount maximums smaller for reasons such as to be able to accommodate opening new channels. The wallet provider would need to keep a channel open all the time to accommodate getting payments to you

Bitcoin is technically still in Beta. Lightning is live with enough bitcoin on it for handling lots of transactions. 
Wallets should support it now and displaying transaction fees and time to complete transaction/bitcoin confirmations/lightning confirmation should be a part of the wallet in order for users to make the best available transaction.

It takes too long to download blockchain if you increase block size. Scaling Bitcoin 101 - Bitcoin Cash doomed to fail in order to reach high Transactions Per Secound as it will require centralization - not everyone can download store and keep updated the Blockchain.  So to scale Bitcoin allowing a global amount of users and higher TPS we need a 2nd layer solution - to aggregate transactions - and thus Lightning network. Lightning Network can handle ridiculous amount of TPS - way higher than Visa even, and allows Bitcoin to scale

Yes Bitcoin Cash having bigger blocks will make it harder to stay synced to the blockchain due to how much more space it takes up. Requires more resources/costs/hardware/download speed to download and run a full node and validate transactions. Bitcoin Core appreciates Blockchain block size importance for decentralization and ensuring transaction integrity from outside forces.

All languages... prefer C# but checked out the go/scala/c implementations for lightning network and went with lightningd
But anyways, I can use existing software (bitcoin core/lightning  )for my wallets and not have to develop anything. Users need to have lightning available to them to utilize on whatever wallet configuration/implementation they have
