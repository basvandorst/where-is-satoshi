Normal organizations don't just have a fractional reserve; they don't have *any* reserves. It would be tremendously silly for them to borrow money, paying interest to do so, and then just stuff it in a corner somewhere.
So yes, the US loaned money it "doesn't have"; it used the sale of Treasury bonds to provide the capital for the loans it offered. If this counts as creating money, you're also creating money when you take out a mortgage on your house. That's not what most people think the term means.

Fractional reserve banking is very possible with Bitcoin, though. What makes you think it isn't?

Correct. Inflation increases purchasing power because it provides cheaper credit, not because of some trickery with sticky prices and wage increases.

No, that's not what he's talking about.
In investment analysis, there are two types of value. There's *market* value, which is the price that people will pay under current market conditions. And there's *intrinsic* value, which is the total monetary benefit that can be extracted from owning an investment. In ideal conditions, market value and intrinsic value are equal; you make investing profits by being able to determine when they are not.
In the late 1990s, people didn't think about it this way. They didn't bother to asses the intrinsic value of Internet company stocks, because they didn't think they needed to. Everyone knew that the Internet was the next big thing, so if you invested in a bunch of internet companies, your portfolio couldn't *possibly* fail to rise.
They were right about the Internet, at least.

The mechanism is interconvertibility. If store-of-value gold is worth less than jewelry gold, jewelers will buy some store-of-value gold and use it to make jewelry. If store-of-value gold is worth more than jewelry gold, investors will melt down jewelry to make gold bars.
The value of the Blockchain can be calculated, but it's not clear how this value is connected to the value of any particular number of Bitcoins. If we determine that the market values trusted transactions at 2% of transaction value, how does that translate to a correct Bitcoin price? If the current price is not equal to that correct price, how can we profit from the difference?
@_date: 2014-03-15 18:32:19
He said it about Bitcoin, because many Bitcoin investors *don't* understand that. Many of them *do* think that you should invest because, when it becomes the currency of the future, you'll have a share of the Bitcoin economy.

You've been misled. The Austrian school is not some kind of viable alternative theory; it's factually wrong, in many important ways.
Even if we don't take that for granted, the two paragraphs you cited make no sense. It's possible that there's some level of investment that is too large to be sustainable, I suppose. It's true that there's some level of investment which would be reached if the Federal Reserve purchased no assets. But there's no reason to believe that these levels are identical. Your source doesn't attempt to argue that they are; it just assumes this.

No other variable can be at play. It is strictly better for me to receive 100 dollars at the end of the year than to receive 90 dollars at the end of the year. The value other people assign to the investment isn't relevant; if I think its value is 90 end-of-year dollars, I am objectively incorrect.

I've heard of inflation. I've heard people talk about debt-based currencies, but in my experience, they don't seem to actually exist.

*That isn't what intrinsic value means in this context.*
In finance, "intrinsic value" refers to the total value of extra stuff I get by owning an investment. For instance, if I have a well, the intrinsic value of the well is the (time-discounted) value of all water it will produce. So bitcoin has no intrinsic value simply because a Bitcoin generates nothing.

When I take out a mortgage, I've created two new balance sheet entries. The bank has my mortgage as an asset, and I have my mortgage as a liability. So the sum of assets in existence is larger.
When the government sells a Treasury bill, it's created two new balance sheet entries. The buyer has the Treasury bill as an asset, and the government has its obligation as a liability.
These are not different from an accounting standpoint. *Any* loan, backed by a hard asset or not, "creates money" in the sense you're talking about. So if you don't think people should create money like this, you don't think they should make any loans.
What is everyone else talking about when they say "creating money"? They're talking about creating *liquid* money. The full amount of deposits in a bank are liquid, but the loans they make are also liquid. So the total value of *liquid* assets in the economy has gone up. Mortgages and Treasury bills are not liquid, so in the normal sense of "money", they don't count.

The license costs total to about $10k per state. That's not insignificant, but neither is it a huge amount of money.
The issue Mt. Gox found was that its business model requires it to register as a "money transmitter" in most states. This requires a deposit of a millionish dollars in securities, which is certainly a lot.
Of course, that's the *point* of the deposit requirement. Small startup companies cannot safely engage in money transmission; as demonstrated by a certain high profile example, there are too many ways for them to mess up and lose everyone's stuff. Any well-run exchange, if it is not backed up by lots of capital, will not want to operate in a way that compels it to be a money transmitter.

Oh, I see the problem. You're confused about how tax deductions work.
When people say you can "deduct $X from your taxes", it's not subtracted from your tax payment. It's subtracted from your *income*, and then the amount of taxes you have to pay is calculated based on your new, lower income. You can deduct the full amount of capital losses (up to a certain maximum), but that doesn't mean your taxes will be reduced by the amount of the loss.

Sure they can.

Increasing the block time doesn't help. The problem is data transfer costs.
If obtaining a current copy of the blockchain costs me X, I will not verify it with multiple sources, unless doing so will provide me with value greater than X. Similarly, if setting up a transfer connection costs me any amount of money, I will not use some kind of randomized algorithm to find my source; I will simply use the same sources every time. 
Thus, we end up with a centralized trust-based system.

Addresses don't need to be registered with the blockchain. In fact, the blockchain doesn't even really know about addresses. Transactions don't output to addresses; they output to a short little script, which any new transactions attempting to spend the output must satisfy.
The standard kind of script says "prove you have the private key that corresponds to suchandsuch public key". When you generate an address, you're really creating a private key and finding the corresponding public key (or *address*. So you'll be able to spend the output of any transactions "sent to" that address, without any sort of registration.

The primary legal basis for the online gambling ban is currently the [Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]( The law clearly bans any financial institution from facilitating online gambling; since nobody's going to mail envelopes full of cash, this has historically constituted an effective ban. However, blockchain transactions do not go through a financial institution as defined by law. Some people have taken this to mean that Bitcoin gambling might be legal.
However, the law also bans transactions through a "money transmitting service", as defined in 31 U.S.C. §5330(d)(2):


The blockchain is almost certainly an electronic funds transfer network, and thus Bitcoin is probably a money transmitting service. If it is, accepting Bitcoin payments for online gambling is not legal.
Note that this has absolutely nothing to do with the IRS decision. This is because an IRS determination about the tax status of a thing does not affect its legal status elsewhere.

They could, for instance, refuse to process transactions with a fee below 0.0005 BTC. 
The incentives don't *currently* align to allow this, of course. Because of the block reward, there's tons of block space available, so basically any transaction with a nonzero fee is going to be picked up. But when the block reward gets halved, mining will be much less profitable, so transaction space will presumably be at more of a premium.

In most countries, the last paragraph does not hold. They don't simply impose "prudential regulation"; they set a hard reserve ratio, as you describe.

Then people start storing all their bitcoins there to get free money, and we have a bank.

Now, Mt. Gox had an official exchange rate for those two things. It promised it would exchange dollars for GoxBucks, and Bitcoins for GoxCoins, at a 1:1 ratio. So people often just talked directly about dollars and Bitcoins on Mt. Gox.

Orphaned blocks are a regular occurrence. So an attacker who *did* control 51% of mining power could double-spend 1 confirmation transactions freely; as long as they limited themselves to one every few days, they'd never raise suspicion.

It *is* already a law. Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 402: irrelevant evidence is not admissible. The prosecutors are simply asking the judge to rule that this particular evidence isn't relevant.

Why did you say "644%/month" as though it's a rate, then? 644 is indeed the result of dividing 116,000 by 15 times 12, but 644% does not correspond to any actual return in any actual month.

Any money-based economic system is necessarily biased. That's what money *means*; people have a claim on the goods produced by society in proportion to the amount of money they have. So if you're offended by the very idea of bias, Bitcoin does not solve your problems.

OP has said they engage in the following transaction flow:

* OP uses dollars received from D to buy more Bitcoins.
So if D happens to pay in drug money, he can exploit OP's arrangement to engage in money laundering. This is because OP is in fact running an unlicensed money transmission business, albeit a really limited one that can only send funds to Coinbase.

Hulsmann is not a tremendously reliable source.
The concept of "malinvestment" makes sense when taken at face value. A lower cost of credit permits rational investments that would not be possible with a higher cost of credit. So if there's some value to which the cost of credit will inevitably regress, we want to make sure people are aware of the value. People who don't know the "natural" value of credit will either make bad investments or fail to make good investments. Like most Austrians, Hulsmann makes this (again, perfectly reasonable!) argument.
But he presupposes that there *is* a natural equilibrium cost of credit, and that the equilibrium cannot be sustainably altered by monetary policy. What's the evidence for these claims?

What's special about newly printed money that allows it to create inflation like this? How can you spending a new $100 bill cause a different effect on the economy than me spending a $100 bill I found in my pants?

1) The loans weren't *just* loans; the Treasury also made temporary purchases of certain types of assets. The Federal Reserve could have filled this role, but it wasn't clear whether or not they would.
2) Calling the Federal Reserve a "private corporation" is horribly misleading. The system is established by government law, and its leadership is directly appointed by the government.
3) Saying that the government pays interest to the Federal Reserve is horribly misleading. All profits the Federal Reserve earns are returned to the US Treasury. We have the Federal Reserve handle all money creation so that the rate of money creation is independent of the current fiscal state of the government; most economists believe this is optimal.

It's possible to have multiple blockchains coming from the same parent block. The Bitcoin protocol determines which one is the "real" blockchain based on how long it is; the longest one wins.
If you control a majority of the mining power, nobody can make a longer blockchain than you. So whenever you spend Bitcoin, you can allow your transaction to be confirmed in blocks B, C, and D, then start mining out the chain from block A. Even with the 3 block head start, you will eventually outpace anyone trying to mine from block D; your chain will become the real one, and your transaction will have been erased.
To control a majority of the mining power, you'll need a huge number of Bitcoin mining ASICs.

The problem comes in when you're buying *and* selling bitcoin.

I don't understand how you can believe this, though.

I know this game, dude. 
You tried to pull a gotcha with exchange rate BS; many people don't understand that exchange rates do not mirror goods prices. So if I made a prediction about the exchange rates, you'd pull up data showing that the exchange rate is only stable to 10-20% in the medium term, and I'd have to admit defeat. But I *do* know about inflation rates, it turns out.
So you went onto the backup plan. Ask me to make predictions about "baskets", while carefully not mentioning what baskets you're actually not talking about. If I return with predictions about the inflation rates in the US and in the Eurozone, you complain that the baskets are different. If I return with predictions about identical baskets, you complain that the data is unreliable because it's not official. Either way, you get to feel smugly superior, and dismiss anything else I have to say.

What do you mean, an attack on the Bitcoin protocol? He's not going around blowing up mining operations; he's simply using the protocol to execute something many people don't expect the protocol to allow.

Inflation is the descriptive term for a general increase in price over periods of time. This is *not* the same as the total cost of your expenses.
For instance, take rent. Rent prices are consistently rising above inflation, but this isn't because there's some real inflation that isn't being measured. It's because there's a fixed quantity of land in desirable areas, and more people every year would like to live there. The operation of supply and demand isn't inflation.

This doesn't make sense. An investment is profitable if and only if its inflation-adjusted returns are larger than its inflation-adjusted cost. The specific rate of inflation doesn't change this; no amount of inflation makes otherwise unprofitable investments profitable.
What inflation changes is the price of the baseline investment strategy. Investments offering worse returns than stuffing cash in a safe cannot rationally happen, even if they are still profitable. Changing to a deflationary currency would not make anyone more likely to invest in asteroid mining.

Your chart is simply wrong. The Federal Reserve loans money only on an emergency basis; it does not maintain long-term loans to increase the money supply.
As you said earlier (did you not notice the inconsistency?), money is generally created through the purchase of government bonds.

The price of things like iPhones decreases over time, but all reasonable market participants know this. Thus, with an assumption of perfect competition, there is no market strategy allowing me to profit from that fact.
If the price of *everything* decreases over time, and I have some money already, I don't need a market strategy. If I just hold on to my money and refuse to engage in trade, I will be wealthier next year. All markets will thus end up distorted in my favor, since I'll only accept a price that overcomes my incentive to buy no good and consume no services.

Yes, that's true. People who have taken an introductory college economics class often assume they know more than they do.
In finance, "intrinsic value" means a different thing than what you are saying. The intrinsic value of a financial product is the value of all future income you will get by owning that product.

Financial regulations can't and don't ensure that collapses can't happen. They ensure that, when collapses *do* happen, nobody but the business that collapsed is seriously harmed. Mt. Gox was a bad company that deserved to fail, but compliance with regulations would not somehow have prevented it from failing; it simply would have failed in a way that doesn't nullify most of its liabilities.
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:15:16
Because current regulations do not impose any cryptocurrency-specific restrictions.
@_date: 2014-03-12 12:08:37
1. We don't know yet. The state's financial regulator has called for interested companies to submit proposals for virtual currency exchanges, presumably including methods to ensure that consumers are adequately protected. The specific regulations that will be imposed have not been announced, and may not have been decided yet.
2. It would apply to exchanges in the state of New York. However, since Wall Street is in New York, the rest of the country often follows New York's lead on financial regulations.
3. Bitcoin is currently in a sort of legal limbo. Because it's not clear exactly what a regulation-compliant exchange looks like, the government isn't trying that hard to stop unregulated exchanges. If cryptocurrency-specific regulations are written, this will likely stop. Some people dislike this because they are libertarians, and place a high value on a lack of regulation in and of itself.

Most people who think their accounts were closed for "bitcoin activities" are wrong. They were trading money out of their accounts for Bitcoin, selling these coins to other people, and then putting the money back in to buy more. This is textbook money laundering.
@_date: 2014-03-29 06:46:27
They were. They were not 20% monthly.
@_date: 2014-05-07 09:56:41
It doesn't make sense to reconstruct Mt. Gox. They simply don't have any useful assets; anyone who wanted to make a Bitcoin exchange would do so under a new name, and it's not like Mt. Gox has some kind of awesome back-end code. This is why all of the reconstruction proposals I've seen are pretty transparent attempt to deliver more funds to a certain group of people who got burned.
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:14:59
I mean, that's an important caveat. Why *don't* companies want to, and how are we going to fix it? The vast majority of people (at least in developed countries) do not want to be responsible for the security of their money.
@_date: 2014-05-29 13:23:50
They say our Bitcoin internet points are meaningless, so let's go take their Reddit internet points. That'll show them!

What, specifically, is your claim of discrimination? I'm happy to explain what your options are, but I need something to work on here.
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:03:09
But you need lots of money to safely operate a financial exchange.
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:09:07


Not investing gives real returns equal to the rate of deflation.
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:09:14
Bartering property for goods and services is also taxable.
In practice, it's difficult to impose those taxes with the infrastructure currently in place, so the IRS doesn't usually bother. But Bitcoin is not particularly difficult to track, so I wouldn't expect to be getting off scot free.
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:36:06
I'm not sure that "*extremely* unstable" is quite accurate. 
Either way, fractional reserve banking is a natural consequence of a simple fact: at any particular time, most people who've deposited their money don't need it. So a fractional reserve bank will always be able to give me superior risk-adjusted returns to a full reserve bank (and to stuffing money under my mattress).
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:42:35
But they sometimes call [the exact same policies]( "tax breaks". This doesn't really seem consistent with your hypothesis.
@_date: 2014-04-05 21:42:59
Because fractional reserve banks provide a way to safely store my money for free. Without fractional reserve banking, I either have to pay a full reserve bank to hold my funds, or spend time and effort figuring out how to secure them myself.
I *think* this answers your question? I'm not quite sure what you're talking about with regard to "bitcoin bank notes", because fractional reserve banking doesn't automatically mean banks would issue intermediary "bank notes", or that we'd trade in those notes. The US dollars I withdraw from my bank say they're "Federal Reserve notes", but that's mostly a historical artifact; there's no more real kind of dollar they represent.
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:53:15
But if my investments go to 0, it doesn't matter whether or not I have an *immediate* liquidity problem, or if I have 20% in reserve. I still have liabilities in excess of assets, so I'm bankrupt.
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:12:00
You're correct. "Verifying the blockchain" is a misleading phrase some people use to describe that. Actual verification of the blockchain just involves matching the hashes, and does not produce any reward.
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:40:45


Well, yeah, that's the problem. It doesn't really *cost* less; you're just doing arbitrage to mitigate the cost. This won't work if Bitcoin transfers between the countries become common.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:34:17
But everyone else sees exactly the same prices I do, at exactly the same times. So how have I gotten more benefit from the act of creation than any other person with 10,000 coins?
@_date: 2014-06-10 21:07:30
I don't see why Bitcoin counts as Internet money, but Paypal and Amazon Payments and Google Wallet don't.
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:39:38
Other currency exchange companies keep fees low by offering a less than competitive exchange rate and pocketing the difference. And the sustainability of completely free transaction processing seems questionable. Do you plan to continue your Bitcoin Best Bid system indefinitely, or should we expect more traditional exchange rate calculations in the future?
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:23:45


But to do that, you need to provide reasons why people not in your network would benefit from joining it. If it's only beneficial once I go and get even *more* people to join the network... well, that's a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:23:04


This isn't actually a constraint. Sure, the fractional reserve bank has to charge lower fees. But it's doing that *anyway*, because it also makes a profit by loaning out deposited money. This is why the free market did not select them out.
@_date: 2014-03-29 07:58:24
But this petition isn't even *asking* for that. It does not request an abolition of taxes on virtual currency, or even an abolition of taxes on virtual currency purchases. It just requests that the IRS classify Bitcoin as a different kind of financial product.
@_date: 2014-04-16 08:15:10
Bitcoins were never tax free. A lot of Bitcoiners just decided they wouldn't pay any taxes until someone specifically ordered them to do so.
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:32:18


No, this is completely untrue. I don't understand why nobody gets called on this.
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:45:55
What makes a provider of off chain transactions more difficult to locate than a provider of any other other online service?
@_date: 2014-07-20 18:16:35
Because pump-and-dump schemes are unethical and illegal.
@_date: 2014-03-01 14:46:26
I'm not convinced that's true, at least not without forcing businesses to publicly reveal important financial information. What's changed?
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:54:22
Yes, but this is one of the few things that actually everyone agrees on. Employment will never be near 100%.
@_date: 2014-06-26 23:59:26
What's "so often"? Banks don't really fail that often in my opinion; how often do you think they *should* be failing?
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:04:28


hmm yes how did I miss such a simple thing
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:06:43
If you behave economically rationally, yes. The risk-average cost of transactions has increased, so you should want to spend less.
@_date: 2014-05-10 02:30:31
Huh? OP's account activity is, from their perspective, indistinguishable from money laundering. Facilitating money laundering is a crime, so they don't really have the option to do nothing here.
@_date: 2014-03-29 07:07:07
150% a year is only 8% monthly. 20% monthly corresponds to an *790%* yearly return.
@_date: 2014-04-09 23:00:08
But they're not the same thing, so I don't know which one you're actually trying to discuss.
@_date: 2014-07-18 03:51:45


Okay but crypto spending is not illegal in New York either. So...
@_date: 2014-05-12 15:05:12
Again, the Federal Reserve Act lays this out pretty clearly.
@_date: 2014-04-09 21:33:37
*Why* does a market cap of several hundred billion dollars seem about right to you? What makes you think this specific number will be reached?
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:23:55
Fractional reserve banking is a *third* thing, distinct from both fiat currency and government budget deficits. I really don't know how to respond when you keep changing the topic.
@_date: 2014-04-20 18:56:28
That's exactly my point. Deflation doesn't cause any bias towards safer investments, or even more profitable investments. It only causes a bias towards not investing at all.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:12:43
Regulations are necessary to *stop* fractional reserve banking, too.
@_date: 2014-03-18 19:41:18
Can you provide a specific example of a bank that did not need a bailout but was forced to accept one, or an international bank that was secretly bailed out? I'm honestly not sure what incidents you're referencing here.
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:50:07
Who knows? It is demonstrably impossible to profit from purchasing mining hardware, but people still do it. We can't work under the assumption that miners are being rational.
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:04:22
That means the same thing. Risky customers are, by definition, customers the bank cannot obtain a reliable profit from doing business with.
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:03:09
Money creation is often executed through debt, but this does not mean that all instances of debt involve money creation. You do not create $300,000 when you take out a mortgage.
@_date: 2014-04-20 14:16:02
No, that's not true. Someone's given you false information.
@_date: 2014-08-15 05:53:44
That only further underscores my point that banks don't have to get more deposits to make more loans.
@_date: 2014-04-02 04:19:14
There are currently an average of four *hundred* transactions per block. What makes you believe 100k is a realistic number?
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:36:49
They could lose that many coins by losing the private key. Since a lot of Bitcoin users have a lot of stupid ideas about private keys, this isn't inconceivable.
@_date: 2014-05-12 17:53:38
Banks aren't *against* Bitcoin, in the same way that they aren't *against* Pogs. They just don't think Bitcoin is tremendously interesting or relevant.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:38:57
If nobody cares enough to make structural changes, the blockchain will be unreasonably large in 20 years. It won't be around simply because nobody will bother to maintain it.
@_date: 2014-03-15 16:29:24
"Intrinsic value" means a different thing in finance than it does in economics. In the financial sense, intrinsic value refers to the time-discounted income earned from owning an asset, and owning a Bitcoin produces no income. This means that, if you're investing in Bitcoin, you're necessarily playing the market.
Why is this important to point out? Well, lots of Bitcoin investors don't seem to *realize* this is what they're doing. For instance, many try to apply fundamental analysis to the investment; they think that, if the Bitcoin network becomes ten times larger, their investment will be worth ten times as much. This kind of misunderstanding is how people lose a lot of money.
@_date: 2014-05-07 11:00:19
The US is the only country where the whole money transmitter framework is really a thing. Different countries have very different frameworks, but the idea of capital requirements is common.
I'm not trying to make the point that regulations are needed here. The point I'm trying to make is that financial regulations *have a purpose*; they always solve or attempt to solve some real, concrete problem.
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:31:04
A store of value is an object whose value in the future is predictable. It doesn't matter whether or not the predicted value is identical to the value the object *currently* has.
@_date: 2014-07-27 02:58:39
The regulations illegalize creating altcoins which are used as a medium of exchange or a store of value. The term "Virtual Currency", as defined, does not include altcoins which aren't used for that.
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:54:52
I don't think that's correct. I trust online banking and credit cards only because I know that, if someone *does* steal my money, I can get it back.
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:00:16
Why would the fee still be 0.5 cents? I would expect miners to demand a higher fee to make up for the lost revenue from block rewards. You're postulating that the supply curve for mining power is independent of net mining cost, and that seems highly questionable.
@_date: 2014-03-13 00:09:07
What do you mean, why not? You haven't proposed a process by which I *could*. I can send her .185 Bitcoins, but that's not the same thing.

I'm not sure you picked a good example, because gold almost certainly *is* in a bubble.
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:28:39
I still have the same question, though. The standard explanation for why free markets are efficient assumes that information is symmetric and complete. So how do you know that free markets minus perfect information are still efficient?
@_date: 2014-05-10 08:50:58
No, that's not the same thing at all. The analogous situation would be OP buying a gold bar from D, selling it to C, and then repeating.
@_date: 2014-07-17 22:01:18
Yup! You can tell I'm an idiot because I don't automatically agree with your incoherent rants.
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:52:25
I have taken a look. Like many, this guy is just straight up delusional; he's trying to argue that the first mover in cryptocurrency will remain dominant, citing Facebook's victory over Myspace as an example. Of course, he has pretty strong financial incentives here; his investment won't be worth much if Dogecoin becomes the dominant cryptocurrency, so he had *better* believe Bitcoin will stay on top.
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:44:28
There is no meaningful ceteris paribus situation. Mining isn't generally profitable *now*; if net costs increased by $11,000 per block, the amount of mining would necessarily plummet.
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:34:50
The gold market is extremely hard to understand. This is because until *2000*, some goverments were engaging in massive market manipulation to obtain their desired standard of gold reserves. There probably isn't enough data to derive useful conclusions about the market.

That isn't really consistent with history, though. Central banking was developed *after* fractional reserve banking, when popular outcry about bank failures became too large to ignore.

They will affect average users only to the extent that they affect the services available. Average users will not be engaging in the kind of behavior that might require a license.

They're going to have to not be 100% Bitcoin companies if they want to operate as money transmitters. You have to use dollars or dollar-denominated bonds to meet capital requirements; this is pretty stadard.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:28:41
Because it doesn't actually make *sense*. Like most scaremongering about the national debt, it relies on a bunch of completely false things. Just to list a few of them:
* The national debt is owed by the American people collectively.
* The US is delinquent on its national debt. If the national debt is $17 trillion, that means the US was supposed to pay out $17 trillion and failed to do so.
* The US's creditors can "call in" the debt, and simply haven't chosen to do so. If China chooses to call in its debt holdings, the US must immediately find a trillion dollars to pay them.
* The national debt must, at some point, be reduced to $0.
* A national debt of $0 is desirable.
Again, *all of these are false*. They're obviously false to anyone who understands even a tiny bit about government finances. But because they sound intuitive to people who only know about *consumer* debt, they keep being propagated.
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:37:06


This is transparently dishonest, and I really don't know why people think it sounds so good. The fact that I'm not willing to put my business at a competitive disadvantage for higher wages does not make it "hypocritical" for me to support a higher minimum wage. Buffet is not one of the people who's arguing that lower wages are exploitative or whatever; he just thinks the country would be a better place if minimum wage workers were paid $15.

Why is M3 necessary to know the "number of dollars"? What makes M3 a more accurate measurement of that than M1, or MZM, or M3 plus all retirement savings, or any number of conceivable sums of dollar-denominated goods?
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:33:40
There are lots of them. Like I said, we have financial systems where bad actors can't make you lose all your money, unless you specifically *choose* to do something unsafe. Every time someone irreversibly loses their Bitcoin, that is a serious and horrible issue.
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:54:51
The Bitcoin protocol, as currently implemented, doesn't allow *any* number of untrusted participants. The threshold mining power required for a selfish mining attack is zero.
It's true that no number of untrusted participants can create a transaction from an address without the authorization of the address owner. But public key cryptography is also not something Bitcoin created.
And even if we take the nominal up-to-majority fault tolerance as a given, that's *also* not an advance. Castro and Liskov's up-to-33% algorithm assumed that the operations need to have some consistent total ordering, and that the result of a given operation must be deterministic; Bitcoin provides neither guarantee. Adapting their algorithm to drop these guarantees is straightforward, and produces identical fault tolerance.
@_date: 2014-06-14 03:23:22
No, people do not always act rationally. That's kinda the point.

@_date: 2014-03-14 14:14:44
I mean, you *can* replace all those things by just smuggling cash. So that seems like a rather vacuous point. Unless you're claiming that the Bitcoin protocol by itself can accomplish every part of those industries?

As with any tax questions involving large sums of money, you should ask a tax accountant.

The problem is that A and C aren't actually possible outcomes. If we establish that the stability of Bitcoin depends on everyone with large holdings agreeing not to be greedy, Bitcoin will go to zero, because lots of people have large holdings. If we establish the precedent that "the community" may insert or remove arbitrary entries in the transaction ledger, Bitcoin will go to zero, because what's the point then?
@_date: 2014-04-05 20:37:36


This is disingenuous. Paper wallets are widely promoted as a hyper-secure way to store your money. So the *most* secure way to store Bitcoin is the same as the *least* secure way to store most currencies; get a bunch of pieces of paper, and put them in a safe.
That's a big problem.

How so? As far as I can see, you have to find some actor, or pool of actors, with large amounts of every currency that might need to be exchanged. The difficulty of doing this grows significantly with each new currency, and I don't see how technology makes the problem easier to solve.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:28:15


Which is literally exactly the point. Bitcoin is not a good solution to anything in the existing financial paradigms. If you're saying "well maybe new paradigms will emerge!", that's not a rational valuation; that's guesswork.

People can certainly complain and entice change in the status quo there. The problem is that the vast majority of complaints about quantitative easing are *wrong*; people complain about some sort of massive cash printing program the Federal Reserve is not actually doing.

What you're talking about is almost entirely a fabrication.
The $9 trillion you're talking about was in the form of very short term loans; in most cases, loans with a term of one *day*. The Federal Reserve did not just go buy things with trillions of dollars, and adding up every one-day loan over 8 months gives an incredibly misleading number. Furthermore, the data on the loans [was in fact released]( The Inspector General couldn't have understood the question, because "off-balance-sheet transactions" is not a term any honest person uses to describe these loans.
I wasn't exaggerating before. Rand Paul and many other people are blatantly and openly lying to you.

There is nowhere I'm aware of where you have to pay large amounts of money for licenses. We're talking a couple thousand, not a million.
The large amounts you may have seen tossed around are *reserve requirements*. Certain financial businesses are required to hold a specified value of investments in reserve, in order to mitigate the risk of a collapse. Surety bonds are accepted as a fulfillment of this requirement in every US state whose laws I am familiar with, so if you can convince people that your business will never collapse, there's not actually a monetary obstacle here.

I don't understand the conclusion we're supposed to draw from this. If we're not planning to introduce government regulations, how *can* we stop the creation of fractional reserve banks?

The Federal Reserve can adjust the money supply by buying or selling things. But they aren't fiscally constrained. That is, they can never run out of money to spend on buying things. When the Federal Reserve buys more things than a fiscal constraint would allow, people say that the money they spent is "new money".
If this seems weirdly convoluted, that's because it is. The concept of "new money" doesn't really make sense in modern monetary systems; it's shoehorned in only so our monkey brains can get some level of intuition.

The problem is that "housing" is not a single consumer good.

If the split changes to 25/75, the average rent price will increase to $1375.

I doubt Bitcoin is ever going to explosively die at this point. It's too easy to manipulate the apparent market status, and lots of people have strong incentives to do so.
I think that Bitcoin is just going to slowly lose popularity. Bitcoin has basically gotten the maximum media attention it can get, at this point; we're never going to see another huge wave of people joining to pump up a bubble. As people realize that Bitcoin doesn't really solve any of their problems, they'll move on, sticking their account information in a safe deposit box just in case Bitcoin does blow up. The exchanges will say that Bitcoins are worth a lot of money for a while, but that won't correlate very well with any real-world observable.
It's like how some Beanie Babies are still valued at $1k. Bitcoins are still mostly worthless outside of the walled garden of the Bitcoin community; it never needs to die, if people are smart enough to just build new walls further in.

26 USC, section 1. Someone's been lying to you.
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:41:36
I'm saying that "in the 40k+ bracket" doesn't mean what you think it does.
Suppose we have a simple tax system. The $0-20k bracket has a 10% rate, the $20-40k bracket has a 20% rate, and the $40k+ bracket has a 30% rate. How much tax do I pay?
* If I make $20k, I'm entirely in the first bracket. I pay 10%, or $2k.
* If I make $40k, I'm partially in both of the first two brackets. I pay 10% of the $20k in the first bracket, and 20% of the $20k in the second bracket, for a total of $6k.
* If I make $60k, I'm partially in all three brackets. I pay 10% of the $20k in the first, 20% of the $20k in the second, and $30% of the $20k in the third. My total payment is $12k.
Now, suppose I have capital losses of $20k. This means that I can subtract that last $20k of income; since this means all my income fits in the first two brackets, I don't have to pay 30% of anything. But the remainder of my income is still subject to exactly the same tax as it would have been if I made $40k in the first place.

Chargebacks exist to limit the amount of responsibility customers have for fraud.

With Bitcoin, customers bear 100% of the costs of fraud. Thus, because of this additional cost, customers will be unwilling to pay as much.

That's not how modern banks work. They have a reserve requirement to meet, but they only have to meet it at the end of every day. So they can borrow whatever reserves they need to meet that requirement after they close up shop. If no other bank has excess reserves to loan, the Federal Reserve loans unlimited reserves at a fixed price.
This means that banks aren't reserve constrained. A bank will never say "well, we'd *like* to make a loan to you, but we don't have enough reserves right now". They make every loan they think will be profitable, and then go buy whatever reserves they're required to.
Deposits are cheaper to obtain than other types of reserves, though. If a bank gets more reserves from deposits, and less from other banks or the Federal Reserve, they'll spend less money to make any particular loan.

No, that strategy won't work.
If you receive Bitcoin as payment, you have to determine the fair market value at the time of payment, and convert to dollars to determine your income. Let's say you earned 1 bitcoin, valued at $500. Now comes tax day. 
If the price hasn't changed (and you had no other income), you owe $50 in taxes, for a net of $450. Selling or not selling the coin affects nothing.
If the price has gone down to $499, you still owe $50 in taxes, because you still received $500 of value initially. So your net is $449. Selling your entire coin will allow you to deduct $1 in capital losses, bringing the tax down to $49.90 and the net up to $449.10. The capital loss deduction *mitigated* your loss, but not by much.

The cost of running a transaction network is equal to the value which transaction processors receive for running it. Since Bitcoin miners receive about 3% of the total transaction volume, the cost of running the Bitcoin transaction network is about 3%.
It's true that this cost does not come in the form of transaction fees. But that's a different matter. If the Federal Reserve wanted to subsidize Visa directly by printing money and abolishing all transaction fees, they could do that; it wouldn't be accurate to then say that Visa transactions are free.

It's hearsay for the same reason that it'd be hearsay if the prosecution introduced a letter from the FBI saying "We've concluded that Ross Ulbricht is and always has been DPR".

If they're floating point, you get inevitable rounding error, and rounding money into (or out of) existence is very bad.
For instance, if I have 1 billion deposits of .01 BTC, how much BTC do I have? The correct answer is obviously 10 million, but that is not the answer you get if you stored .01 in floating point...

In the absence of government, why would personal security forces not take your money and then kill you and take your stuff?

@_date: 2011-06-15 02:16:53
The problem is that all of the financial infrastructure you're used to relies *hugely* on loans being freely and widely available. Why is this an issue? Well, bitcoins are inherently deflationary.
This means that loans will never be as widely available are as they are now. You see, the thing with fiat currency is that it *inflates*. Most nations have a deliberate monetary policy that their currency should undergo constant slow inflation. The reason, as any good economist will tell you, is that inflation *loosens the money supply*. If you just sit on a pile of inflationary currency, the value of your holdings depreciates with time. So inflation incentivizes you to invest your money, because even if your investments give a zero average return on value you come out ahead.
What happens if you have a currency designed to be deflationary? Well, then the value of your currency holdings *appreciates* over time. That means that investing is no longer optimal whenever you can break even; it's a good idea if and only if you think you're a skilled enough investor to beat the rate of deflation.
And by the way, FDIC insurance exists literally only because the federal government decided it needed to, and it is sustained only on the strength of people believing in the US government. FDIC has available assets *far* below what they need to pay off a nontrivial number of bank defaults; it's useful because it encourages trust that your money won't disappear, not because it actually can do what it claims.

That's not an anti-Bitcoin opinion, it's an obvious fact. It doesn't matter how good you think it is, right now it's primitive as a monetary system.
@_date: 2011-06-15 03:18:28
Because the fundamental thing is *value*, not bitcoins. 
Say there's an investment which, in 100 years, gives you back the value you invested. You'd end up with *more* dollars, because the value of individual dollars went down. But you'd end up with *fewer* bitcoins, because the value of individual bitcoins went up. So investment is a worse idea with a deflationary currency.
@_date: 2011-06-20 00:39:54
Ok, except "you're a guinea pig in the free market of exchanges, and by the way if an exchange loses your money it's gone" is not what I want to hear if I'm going to buy into bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-20 15:23:55
Yeah, but lots of *non*developers do not. I mean, even if they technically say "don't invest more than you're willing to lose", the average bitcoin user then proceeds to talk about how awesome it will definitely be in 10 years when bitcoin is worth so much.

Of course. I was responding to something that said we were already at the step of retailers meaningfully accepting BTC; I agree that the fact that this isn't true does not imply bitcoin is doomed. (I mean, it *is*, but that's not the reason.)
@_date: 2011-06-16 14:16:35
The developers *express* values as doubles, but they are *stored* as integers. There are sometimes valid reasons to express things in floating point (if you're doing data analysis, for instance, you don't need the accuracy and you do need a lack of overhead.) But when you're writing code that actually handles peoples money, you must must must *must* not use floating point in any situation ever. If you do, then you are an idiot or a deliberate scammer.

The problem is that such a pyramid either causes a worse crash, or leads to a bigger bubble that causses an *incredibly* worse crash. There just does not exist a good way for a single investor to sell off large amounts of a commodity.

Yes, deflationary currency is a good thing! I love it when people don't invest!
@_date: 2011-06-16 01:31:20
Honestly, a stable monetary system shouldn't leave open the possibility of this. I know, hindsight is 20/20, and once the early adopters have cashed out it won't be an issue, but I really think this is a problem that could have easily been predicted.
@_date: 2011-06-14 22:48:21
Well, kinda. What you said is true, but you can break the chain of transactions by simply cashing out and back in. Right now that's difficult to do with large sums, but unless you want MtGox to have a permanent monopoly it can only get easier.
@_date: 2011-06-15 03:02:15
The more *bitcoins* you have, the more increasing value you have. The problem is that this means investing in things which are not bitcoins is dumb, unless you (falsely) believe you are a genius investor who can beat the depreciation rate.

Sure, it's *possible* to store things in floating point, and then manipulate them correctly so that calculations are exact. It's just completely irresponsible, because one tiny impossible to debug mistake can introduce rounding error. It's obviously not literally impossible to do correctly, since you can encode arbitrary integers with floating point, but it's such horrible coding practice that there is no sufficient justification for it.

While bitcoinzlol is right that the idea miners would never do stupid things for short-term financial gain is retarded, the danger of 50%+ is also overblown. They could probably do a tiny bit of double spending unnoticed, but that's not a huge deal in perspective.

Anyway, that would basically kill bitcoin. You *need* to have trusted large exchanges at this point, and you can't really make a secret about transferring money to them. I honestly do not know how anyone would work around it.

Then a virus can still steal your stuff, why would that help at all?
@_date: 2011-06-16 15:09:55
But then the traceability of bitcoins is a *byproduct* of the traceability of USD. If bitcoins become an actual currency, such that you don't *need* to cash out with Mt. Gox, then you can't even prove that your bitcoins *were* stolen like this.
@_date: 2011-06-21 22:53:15
Ok, maybe. But why do you think that having more free time will make people *more* productive?
@_date: 2011-06-16 10:10:53

@_date: 2011-06-30 16:43:31
I don't think anyone disagrees that bitcoins are in a bubble right now. I mean, honestly, 15 dollars per coin is just ridiculously high for the amount of adoption they have right now, and we *know* lots of people are buying simply because they expect a profit when the price rises. If you assume that bitcoins will actually have significant intrinsic value when the crash comes, it's just a standard commodity bubble (of course, that's still a bad thing). But if they *don't*, then it's a pure pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2011-06-24 21:25:06
Erm... no, not necessarily.
@_date: 2011-06-30 17:50:05
The important thing isn't that it's there by design; you're right that "I designed the system such that I get your wealth" isn't much of a defense. The important thing is that the design exists *to benefit everyone*. It's the same principle as taxes. You can argue that taxes and inflationary currency are bad things (although you're going to have a really hard time making that argument convincing), but "THEY'RE STEALING MY MONEY SHUTUP" is just not a sufficient argument.
@_date: 2011-06-24 21:37:45
Except you have to weigh that against the huge huge reason bitcoins are unattractive: rapid price fluctuation. When the worth of a bitcoin commonly changes 10% in *hours*, it's just too big of a risk to be dealing in them.
@_date: 2011-06-15 02:58:44

Then the RPC API is broken as it does not report amounts correctly. Conversion between doubles and integers is not lossless, because many possible values of BTC *cannot* be exactly represented in floating point as they describe.
Of course, this is a strange definition of "broken", because there is no situation in which the API will display an incorrect value. But if you still want to call it broken, go ahead.
@_date: 2011-06-30 18:08:58
But that's not the calculus. You're not just betting that BTC 2 will take off, you're betting that one of BTC 2-100 takes off *and* that you picked the correct one.

How is that ridiculous? How are we supposed to discuss the relative benefits of different kinds of monetary policy, if you're saving "your way is immoral shut up" as a trump card?
@_date: 2011-06-21 21:01:15
Yes, economics is definitely that simple!
@_date: 2011-06-23 18:13:56
For a currency, you have to believe that others value them widely enough *and will continue to do so*, at approximately the *same* value. Otherwise you get the situation you have right now, where lots of people are using your "currency" only as a get rich quick scheme.
And it's far from obvious that a currency can reach that except by being a physical commodity or by fiat backed by a government. Bitcoins are technically a commodity currency, but it's a commodity that exists only by agreement of all users. With something like gold, it's very obvious what is and is not gold, so it can reasonably be used as a commodity backing. Bitcoin is taking 21 million long numbers, effectively writing GOLD on them in permanent marker, and then running around assuring everyone that they're valuable.

@_date: 2011-06-17 18:32:36
This isn't an irrational fear, this is a basic principle of financial systems design. If you don't know not to use floating point calculations, you don't know how to program something that handles money, and your opinion is therefore irrelevant.
@_date: 2011-07-01 06:59:15
You see *inflation* as *unethical*? I... don't really feel much like engaging something like that, honestly.
@_date: 2011-06-18 17:33:45
You see, this is why I don't like the prominence the law of supply and demand gets in basic economics education. Yes, it's true that supply and demand changes the market, but it's possible for things to incidentally affect supply and demand. It's entirely concievable that miners are selling off more now that the difficulty has increased, or that people are buying less because they think the difficulty increase will cut into profits.
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:59:30
Yeah, but this wasn't some tiny little security flaw, or cascading failure of security systems caused by a little crack. This was just straight out the exchange shitting all over itself because a hacker got access to an account.
@_date: 2011-06-30 16:44:31
Are you seriously arguing that the difference is that *nobody is being convinced to invest in bitcoin*? Because that's... pretty obviously false, dude.
@_date: 2011-06-15 01:58:29
No, coins in circulation becoem more valuable because other coins are unmoving. It doesn't matter if they're lost or some guy is just hoarding them, except when the hoarder decides to start moving his coins.

There is something to prevent it: *bitcoin is anonymous*. Insurance fraud is 100% undetectable, and therefore a bitcoin insurance company cannot exist.

@_date: 2011-06-21 22:59:05
If information were perfect and economies were perfectly elastic, not spending money would increase the value of all other money and it would end up balancing out. Real economies don't satisfy these conditions though; when you take money out of circulation, people don't immediately notice and adjust all their values. So for a while after you take money out of circulation, the total amount of money *in* circulation is worth less.
@_date: 2011-06-14 23:04:37
Why would you ever want to lend out bitcoins? They appreciate in value by just sitting on them.

And then it and everyone else encourages you to get in on the ground floor of bitcoins, before they "get big" and you are magically rich.

Who *accepts* bitcoins as more than a proxy for USD?
@_date: 2011-06-30 18:44:16
With an inflationary currency, money loses value if you sit on it. That encourages people *not* to just sit on their money; instead, you deposit it into a bank or invest it yourself, and it keeps flowing through the economy. With a deflationary currency, there is much less incentive to invest in things, for precisely the reason you describe; your money increases in value even if you're not using it to *do* anything.
@_date: 2011-06-14 01:46:16

I don't think personal responsibility is a bad thing, I think making it completely impossible to recover is a bad thing. Those worst case scenarios for identity theft will become the best case scenario; is that really worth the decrease in risk that some company will leak your bank information?
@_date: 2011-06-30 18:50:41
That's the point, it *isn't* cool. If your money is stored in a bank, the bank then loans it out to other people who want to do things with it, and the money keeps flowing through the economy. If your money is stored in a file on your hard drive, the money just sits there doing nothing until you personally want to spend it. That's a *bad thing*.
@_date: 2011-06-14 20:44:06
The problem is that it is completely impossible to reverse or IRL trace a bitcoin transaction. So once I've gotten to the step where I transfer your bitcoins out of your account, it is impossible to find me to impose criminal sanctions. More importantly to you, it is impossible to retrieve your money, and since you're holding bitcoins on your computer rather than dollars at an insured bank, that means you don't get to have it anymore.
@_date: 2011-06-16 07:06:34
It's basically impossible to prove that someone stole a file from a computer, if that someone knows what they're doing. At least, not without the kind of tracking tools that Bitcoin users decry as authoritarian.
@_date: 2011-06-30 18:34:28
I think it's fairly obvious that we're *far* above the natural support price for bitcoin right now. And the fact that bitcoin is inherently deflationary leads to a whole bunch of other problems...
@_date: 2011-06-14 21:50:47
What's relevant is the number of bitcoins in circulation though. That's what affects the economy.
@_date: 2011-06-16 15:19:34
I'm not conceding because you're insulting me, not because I think I was right. You do understand why a system of tracking that relies on bitcoins *not* being a useful currency doesn't fill me with confidence, yes?
@_date: 2011-06-18 16:59:07

There can still be an important problem, even if his story isn't actually true.
And yes, it's completely impossible to trace a cash transaction. The difference is that if you want to do a transaction in dollars, you don't *have* to use cash. You can go through paypal or a credit card or something, so that someone along the line can say WHOA HOLD UP BUDDY and get you your money back. As a matter of design principle, Bitcoin doesn't really let you do this, which is why Bitcoin will never be a useful currency for anything you can't pay cash for.

Bitcoin is deflationary in the sense that, if Bitcoin becomes a stable currency, the accepted value of 1 BTC must rise in the long term. This is uncontestable to anyone who knows math.
Bitcoin is valueless in the sense that it has no *intrinsic* value; only the agreement of everyone that it has value. This isn't necessarily a problem for a currency (gold, silver, and all fiat currencies have the same problem), but for various reasons it may be problematic for bitcoin.

*The price of bitcoin can't rise forever.*
People right now are buying into bitcoin in the expectation that they will be in the nth generation of early adopters, and will thus benefit when the price rises. But again, *the price can't rise forever*. When enough people realize this, the price will then begin to drop. As the price drops, more and more people will start trying to use all of their paper wealth, which will cause the price to drop even more. Even if nobody consciously intended it as a scam, lots of people are going to lose money there.

Until people can do finance or pay taxes in Bitcoin, it can't replace fiat currencies. Nobody cares if it partly devalues fiat; fiat currencies have central banks, which can adjust monetary policy to compensate for any such devaluing.

No, this is false. The gold standard period was noted for much wider swings in currency value than we've seen since governments started regulating monetary policy.


Unemployment is lower, more money is flowing through the economy, and I don't have to be rich to utilize debt. I can also be confident that the inflation rate now will be about the same as the inflation rate a year from now, so I can predict with a high degree of accuracy how much money I require to buy things in the future.

Over the past century or two, we've had a lot of economic failures, and they've taught us some things about what makes a good currency. For instance, we know that we want to minimize the currency's use for anything but exchange, and that we want the inflation rate to be as close to constant as we can get it.
Bitcoin rejects almost all of this knowledge we've acquired, for no apparent reason.
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:45:09


No, this isn't true. As you said, deflation specifically encourages hoarding; if you aren't sufficiently enticed by any product available, you will just sit on your money and watch it grow in value.

He isn't saying that, in some hypothetical future Bitcoin economy, people would never consume anything. He's saying that nobody has any incentive to transition to a Bitcoin economy.

@_date: 2013-11-15 22:26:08
Please explain how any one of those things has a potential impact to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:43:15
1) There are serious theoretical concerns about whether or not this makes it superior; the vast majority of economists think that controlled printing of more currency is a *good* thing. But nevertheless, it is true that Bitcoin has a technical upper limit on the supply, and this does mean that in the long term it will be a better value store. (Note that this does not mean it's necessarily a good value store in the short term.)
2) Half true. In practice, many changes would be accepted by a majority of the network if they were proposed by the devs. But no devs have the power to compel global changes; even the combination of devs + miners isn't enough to compel global changes. (People got a bad understanding of this from the 0.7 -&gt; 0.8 fork, where a small group of devs and miners *was* sufficient to resolve it. This is because of the specific situation and solution. Bitcoin-qt 0.8 clients recognized all blocks as valid, while 0.7 clients only recognized some blocks as valid. So by shifting mining power to the 0.7-compatible blockchain, all currently compatible clients would continue to be compatible.)
3) Half true, as above. There's also the question of whether or not we *would* do that; forcing a fork has a significant cost associated with it, and some particular bad decision might not hurt me enough to justify incurring that cost.
4) True, but above caveats apply.
5) Depends on what you mean by "weakness", I guess; I'd argue that the biggest weakness is how the protocol ignores 100 years of learning about good monetary policy. But if we're just talking about government regulation, yeah, exchanges and vendors are the weak points.
6) Massive computing power doesn't matter; they have to have secret algorithms that we on the outside don't think exist, or all the computing power in the world won't help them crack wallets. Given proper security procedures, Bitcoins are no less secure than cash in a fireproof safe. You obviously don't have the extra security chargebacks provide, but some people would argue that's the point.

I'm gonna do micro here, just because it's easier. If that's a problem tell me.
Suppose there's a large area of farmland, divided up into 100 plots. On this farmland, there are two methods of farming; method A produces yield 500, and method B produces yield 600. There's no way for a farmer to determine how many people are using which method. But there's an additional constraint. Every year, if X% of people use method B, an amount X is permanently removed from the yields of both methods in the future.
Now, in the long term, it's clearly optimal for nobody to use method B. But for any *individual*, no matter what everyone else chose, it's clearly optimal to use method B in each p. Present gains are worth more than future gains; losing one extra unit each subsequent year will almost certainly be worth the 100 extra units I got this year. So in an unconstrained free market, everyone will use method B until the farmland is destroyed.
Which happened in the US, actually. We call it the Dust Bowl.

Prices are sticky, and don't respond immediately to changes in the markets or the money supply. So with constant deflation, you end up in situations where the amount of money circulating is not sufficient to make the exchanges people would like to make. It has nothing to do with whether or not Bitcoins can be sufficiently divided.
If dollars that you just hang on to get less valuable over time, you're incentivized to invest them. That's a very good thing for the economy, and doesn't hurt you at all.
@_date: 2013-10-23 02:37:17
It's not, which is why modern countries delegate money-printing authority to a separate central bank. That way, there's no incentive to print money when doing so would not help out the economy. (There are certainly situations where an increase in the money supply is beneficial to the economy; that's just simple macroeconomics.)
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:10:50

Bitcoin is deflationary only in the long term. It provides no guarantee about what will happen in any given year, simply because nobody can control its inflation rate. And we know what happens to inflation rates when nobody controls them; they swing around wildly and unpredictably. This makes basic business questions like "how much capital do I need" impossible to reliably answer, which isn't good for anyone.

Stability doesn't mean anything about a particular value level; it means that you can predict, with a reasonable level of certainty, what the value of the currency will be in five or ten years. (This was one of the reasons fiat currency was introduced, in fact; gold standard money was very unstable, and was a huge contributor to the cyclic recessions of the 1800s.)
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:30:06
Other currencies are fiat currencies. If Bitcoin ended up getting large enough to drive inflation, the central banks controlling these currencies could constrict the money supply to keep inflation at reasonable levels.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:59:34
Well, that's why Bitcoin hasn't seen super widespread adoption yet. With the exception of giving some tech people a nerdgasm, it's unclear how a business can currently benefit from using Bitcoin. (Unless you're offering illegal services, of course, but...)
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:25:17
Right now, it's deflationary in the short term, because lots of people are procuring Bitcoin simply *because* they think it will be worth more in the future. If Bitcoin ever becomes a healthy currency, this won't happen.
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:02:28
Because important parts of Griffin's claims are factually wrong. Central bank policies are public, not secret. Fiat currencies are more stable, not less. These are not matters of opinion; you can go look at data, and objectively see that they are the case.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:57:42


This is incredibly misleading. In developed countries, currencies have survived mostly unchanged (or been converted voluntarily to the Euro) since modern macroeconomic theory was developed. Heck, the ruble survived the collapse of the Soviet Union. The currencies that don't last long come from undeveloped and unstable countries, where a commodity-backed currency wouldn't last any longer.
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:52:55
There appears to be a good reason that you're a *former* law student. Physical currency isn't any more traceable than Bitcoin, and the feds have very little trouble regulating it.
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:53:16


No, this isn't true. It's a simple exercise to construct situations where the free market, *even assuming perfect rationality*, will lead to a result that is non-optimal. If you're assuming *a priori* that the market will produce the best result, you need to study economics.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:21:05


I don't think this has happened since World War II. It certainly hasn't happened in the US since World War II, since our government doesn't even retain the power to print money.

No it's not. [Just look at historical inflation rates]( and see how much smoother the swings got when the Federal Reserve started having serious power.

I mean, bitcoins are a risky investment, and most people probably ought to be risk-averse with their investments.
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:56:01
*Huh?* Your original point was that deflationary currencies are better for the common man. And it's now a red herring to demand that you explain why you think that?
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:48:07
"Illegal" carries with it the connotation that the activity is *illegitimate*. I don't think anyone would argue that, for instance, wage income is "illegal" because it's taxed at a higher rate than capital gains. So talking about it this way seems to blur the lines between people *regulating* bitcoin and people *banning* bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:02:30
Yes. That is the process I described, except for the incorrect assertion that a bank's reserves are deposited in some Federal Reserve account.

@_date: 2013-12-18 11:26:13
Because the people who track Bitcoin exchanges do not understand finance, the reported price is simply the price of the last successfully completed trade. This is not a stable measurement.

Hey, I hear cash is used for money laundering! The Feds are probably going to seize cash's domain name and ban cash.
This makes sense, as currencies and currency exchanges are exactly the same thing.
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:28:56
It wouldn't. Random individual banks have never tried to adjust their reserve holdings to counteract deflation, simply because they have no strong incentive to do that.
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:00:28


What? How could you possibly derive this information by simply knowing the total amounts of both things?
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:31:49
As much as certain types of investors like to think otherwise, 2 days is not a sufficient sample size to get a statistically significant trend.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:50:17
But we changed the methodology for calculating inflation because we believed it to be inaccurate. Do you have some reason to believe that it was actually more accurate before?
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:46:40
You don't think that banks just get free money from the Federal Reserve, do you? That's not the case.
@_date: 2013-05-21 23:36:56
Why don't you think that could happen? That's precisely what would happen, if a currency which constantly decreases in supply saw widespread use.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:15:19
Credit and physical currency *are* regulated by some sort of agency.
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:29:32
They're competing in the *international* market, which is a relatively small subset of the market. Nobody within the US is using euros just because.

@_date: 2013-05-21 23:09:41
What? We're talking about bitcoin as a *currency*, not as an investment medium. Most things which work as investment media do not work as currencies.
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:33:09
That was never intended to be my argument; sorry if I implied otherwise. The banks have definitely created money.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:34:40
That's an inherent problem in a distributed currency. If there's no centralized authority approving transactions, there's no sensible way to enact a unilateral reversal.
@_date: 2013-11-06 08:37:42
I'm not sure why you're so confident that's a good thing. I don't see why we'd *want* a currency that's also a store of value, contract record, notarization mechanism, and a million other things.

@_date: 2013-10-23 02:35:46
So you agree that, with a deflationary currency, currency shortages will be commonplace. Why do you think currency shortarges are a good thing?
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:53:34
The issue with deflation has little to do with our expectation of growth. If deflation is 5% a year, an intelligent investor will never issue loans or make investments with an expected real return of less than 5% a year; that's a problem.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:24:24
Currencies very rarely compete within a market, though. You don't see people spending dollars in France, or Euros in Brazil. When currencies *are* competing in a market (like we see in Zimbabwe, for instance), that means something has gone horribly wrong.
@_date: 2013-05-21 22:28:25
You don't understand what you're talking about.
If there is a yearly inflation rate of 5%, 100 2014 dollars will be worth 95.24 2013 dollars. So if I have $100 now, I'm incentivized to invest it; not doing so will cost me $4.76.
If there is a yearly deflation rate of 5%, 100 2014 dollars will be worth 105 2013 dollars. So if I have $100 now, I'm incentivized *not* to invest; I will make $5 by just sitting on my money.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:49:36
Not really, no. They didn't obey financial regulations so US banks won't do business with them.

All of those things only work because there is an, efficient, automatic, and decentralized way to ensure trust.

No, again, someone has been lying to you. The Panic of 1907 was only resolved by J.P.

Compiling publicly accessible data about Bitcoin is an attack on Bitcoin. Yup.
@_date: 2013-10-24 09:59:38
The problem is that people treat money in a whole host of irrational ways, making the assumptions of a "normal" supply-demand model inapplicable.
For instance, people react poorly to downwards changes in nominal income. If the number of dollars I earned this year is less than the number of dollars I earned last year, I'll call that a "pay cut", even if deflation might make my real income higher. (It's like how everyone calls a 2% increase of nominal income a raise, even if inflation was 3%.) So a market of deflationary monetary units cannot smoothly reach equilibrium; this irrational behavior will cause the valuation to stick at the old equilibrium, until a sufficient amount of deflation forces a sudden jerk upwards.
@_date: 2013-07-15 12:32:31

Most people don't share your opinion, however.

@_date: 2013-11-16 00:36:17
This doesn't make sense. There *isn't* a lack of regulation; currency markets are highly regulated. These regulations just weren't written to account for the possibility of a distributed cryptocurrency, so it's not clear what some of the provisions mean in that context.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:02:39

The 2009 recession was not the second deepest and certainly not the second longest; 1836, 1839, 1857, 1865, 1873, 1882, 1893, and 1907 were worse. (In fact, that last one was so bad that it forced the US to *create* the Federal Reserve.)


This isn't a coincidence. They don't have a central bank because their currency is denominated in American dollars. They even use American dollar banknotes instead of printing their own.
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:06:40
There were many competing theories on how to modify Newtonian mechanics, and most of them were false. I doubt that our current understanding of monetary economics is 100% correct, but that doesn't somehow mean that Bitcoin has it right.
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:32:11
But the point of futures markets is that you aren't required to *have* the commodity until some point in the future. If the Bitcoin is just taken into escrow or whatever, why would anyone want to play the futures market?

Libertarianism requires markets to reach an efficient equlibrium without regulation. But when a currency isn't stable, for instance, this doesn't happen. With a currency that doesn't have a central bank targeting some particular inflation rate, basic information like "what will money be worth next year" isn't available, so people can't effectively seek optimal outcomes.
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:55:27
But that's exactly the point. Bill Gates is so rich compared to his material needs that his consumer spending is a tiny tiny fraction of his wealth. With inflationary currency, he has to put the rest of his money to work, or he's losing value. Bitcoin Bill Gates would just sit on his money, because he knows that it will increase in value over time, even if and when Bitcoin stabilizes.

No, it's actually not that complicated, especially compared to the kind of complex economic analysis they do normally.

* Many of the good torrent sources *require* seeding.

@_date: 2013-10-24 03:40:53
You're refuting an argument that no good economist was making.
The issue is that prices are resistant to nominal decreases. If I get paid fewer Bitcoins than I was being paid last year, I will feel slighted, even if my real income is higher. If I have to sell things for fewer Bitcoins than they used to cost, I will feel like my business is doing worse, even if real revenues are higher.
Because of this, currencies with a fixed supply are incapable of adjusting smoothly to increases in market volume. Prices get stuck at their old nominal value, which leads to a currency shortage; the money supply simply is not high enough to conduct all the trades people want to make. This is the problem.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:54:39
Look up [SEPA]( The system as a whole isn't really *called* anything, in the same way that the check processing system in the US isn't called anything; it's just one of the functions that banks are expected to perform.

This is one of the major issues I have with the Bitcoin community. Nobody's pressuring the government to produce clear regulations for cryptocurrencies; in fact, exactly the opposite is happening. 
But this doesn't mean bitcoin gets to be unregulated. Cryptocurrencies still have to follow *normal* currency laws, and it's incredibly unclear what is required to do this. It's neither malevolent nor surprising that banks don't want to bother figuring out the answers.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:06:01
But you're still equating "standard of living" with "ability to buy some specific market basket". Like I said, it's not clear that makes sense.

@_date: 2013-07-14 20:31:01
How are you so sure this will happen?
@_date: 2013-05-21 23:03:13

Most of the basic functions that *can* be replaced by currently available decentralized technologies don't need to be. Much of Europe has low-fee instant bank transactions, and in light of the existence of cryptocurrencies, I expect American banks to sink a lot of money into catching up with that. As soon as it's implemented, most current use cases for Bitcoin evaporate; I'll take the instant payment network with chargebacks over the one without.

The problem is that deflation discourages investment, which tends to both hurt businesses and increase unemployment. 
Ideally, we'd fix the inflation rate at *exactly* 0%, but we don't know how to do that. (It's probably not possible.) So instead we target a small rate of inflation, so that natural downswings don't knock the rate much below 0.
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:56:32

Bitcoin is, in the current market, also a commodity. You can declare it to be a currency, but that doesn't change the fact that many people are using it solely as a value store, rather than exchanging it for goods and services.
@_date: 2013-10-23 21:00:50

The concept of "the dollar's value" simply doesn't mean anything in the way you're trying to use it. If the government immediately replaced each of our dollars with two NewDollars, a dollar would be worth half as much, but this wouldn't mean the government has stolen value or that we're any poorer.

For some of the things, sure. But the store of value part isn't built on top of bitcoin, for instance. It's just... part of it. Bitcoins which are being used to store value cannot also be spent, and that's a bad thing.

It's best to maintain risky investments as a small part of your portfolio. If they skyrocket in price and end up dominating the rest, you should sell off some of them and invest the money in other things.

Well, that's one of the major obstacles Bitcoin has to clear. Right now, it's is increasing in value so much that no reasonable cost-benefit analysis justifies spending bitcoins on things. Some people have enough that they can afford to, and they *say* that they're doing it to encourage widespread adoption, but I'm unconvinced it actually makes economic sense.
At some point, it has to be economically rational to spend Bitcoins, or the currency can't succeed. I don't think anyone's clear on how that will happen.

* Bitcoin, by design, does not have a stable inflation rate.

The US is doing just fine, yes. The national debt is not a big deal, as any good economist will tell you.


No. Lots of people are thinking the Euro wasn't really a good idea; sharing a currency with another country means you have to make economic sacrifices for each other, and it's become clear that not all the countries on the Euro are happy about that.

The problem is that bitcoin is also unstable by design; no person or algorithm regulates the value. So while bitcoin does indeed have a "natural deflationary nature", this doesn't really make it any easier for poor people to save. They'll still end up getting their savings wiped out by a random episode of high inflation, and then maybe lose their job in a random episode of high deflation.

@_date: 2013-11-06 20:21:54
No. It has a predictable rate of money creation, but contrary to what a lot of people think, money creation and inflation aren't at all the same thing. Bitcoin would be deflationary, because the number of bitcoins grows more slowly than the economy ususally does in modern countries.
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:57:19


It's both. Do you think these things are contradictory? Why?
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:41:21
They constrict the money supply in a variety of ways. For instance, the US Federal Reserve primarily controls the money supply by buying and selling Treasury securities. Its current holdings sum to about $2 trillion, while M1 money supply is about $2.5 trillion, so it won't run into any issues doing this.
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:49:17
In this particular case... ehh, maybe.
But I've had a lot of experiences where that's not really an excuse. I've had people argue that inflation is bad because countries shouldn't print money to pay for things. I've had people argue that fractional reserve banking is impossible in Bitcoin. So when I say "most people shouldn't have a risky investment profile", and someone jumps in with "I have never made money with risk-aversion and investments...", I find it really hard to give them the benefit of the doubt.
@_date: 2013-09-01 18:35:00
I mean, perhaps if the Austrians weren't so resistant to actually checking their models against the real world, people would take them more seriously.
@_date: 2013-11-06 08:45:18
Again, I don't see why that's a good thing. The point of money is to exchange it, after all; it seems non-optimal to have people using it for other things.
