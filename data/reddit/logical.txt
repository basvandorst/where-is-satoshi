Nope.  Don't do this. Don't suggest this.  Work hard to make sure this isn't possible.  Hopefully the cybercrime cops can catch this guy - it's probably an inside job anyhow and we can track down the coins before they are hopelessly mixed, but if we can't then $60 million is a small price to pay for having an immutable coin worth billions of dollars.

I can't believe how many people still have not learned this lesson.  ONLY THAT WHICH YOU PLAN TO TRADE WITH SHOULD BE IN AN EXCHANGE.  THERE IS A RISK OF EXCHANGES GETTING HACKED.  YOU SHOULD NOT KEEP FUNDS ON THE EXCHANGE THAT DO NOT NEED TO BE THERE.
The exchanges themselves should prominently say this, over and over, and run analytics on their customers' accounts to point out to customers balances that they are keeping which they are not trading on.  They should send emails saying "We are not a bank, and bitcoin does not need banks.  Keep the coins you're not selling on a secure local wallet or offline altogether, you idiot!"

It's downright dishonest to call this company " a top blockchain forensics and technology firm".  It's a handful of bitcoin nobodies and several ethereum developers plus Vitalik, who is a walking disaster right now having forked ethereum and generated no less than 8 ongoing scandals there in just the last two months.

The main distinction between bitcoin and every coin-du-jour knock off is that bitcoin is genuinely decentralized and requires real work to create.  It was not pumped out by changing a few lines of code.  It has demonstrated 9 years of uptime in the face of all forms of attacks (including cloning and forking it).  When the dust settles around people making a new coins every day, it will become clearer that a clone-coin is of no actual value.

There are real people putting money into BCH and they will get “rekt” as the term goes.  I do know of people who have unloaded a lot of BCH for real dollars.  There was someone on the opposite end of that trade who now holds BCH waiting for the miracle from bitcoin Jesus.   But BCH has nothing more to give.  It’s done all it ever planned to. And nobody is using it.   That’s it. Just waiting for the penny to drop that nobody wanted it.  Holding out hope that BTC somehow stops working (while blanking out that anything that could cause that would stop BCH from working as well).

In the full context it would have been a very bad way to buy time for many reasons, and I don't even believe it would have saved a single satoshi in fees because the number of transactions would simply have doubled (both spam and legit).  
You're right to observe that no other coin can scale on chain either.  Ether has made the tradeoff and their chain is growing by 2GB per day for a true full node (  Every time they push up the gas limit to increase block size the blockchain grows faster and faster.  
I think it's an objective fact that can be recognized by any astute student of this issue that on-chain scaling is a dead end strategy that hits its dead end faster the more it is allowed.  With BCH it's only because hardly anyone is using BCH (it's steadily at about 20 transactions a minute) that they haven't had a blockchain problem - but the fact that it's hardly getting any on chain use is somewhat telling about how many big blockers there actually are relative to the amount of noise they made/make.
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:43:09
Larger blocks, like 10Mb in your question, would increase the scale of bitcoin from 3 transactions per second worldwide to 30 transactions per second worldwide.  Not even enough scale to service a small city, while causing the blockchain to grow at a rate tenfold in size, and still, transactions would take minutes to confirm and tens of minutes to ensure they weren't double spent through an orphaned block.  
Lightning transactions are confirmed instantly and take no additional space on the blockchain.  
Now, will miners end up with smaller fees?  Without LN, bitcoin (and all other blockchain based cryptos) simply can't scale beyond the "store of value" use case.  This limits the number of transactions and actually the value of the coin.  While miners will end up with a smaller share of the transaction pie, the actual pie can grow by leaps and bounds, and their smaller share of that pie will be worth a lot more than the 100% share of the fee pie now.

How can you make this claim when there are over a hundred contributors to bitcoin core code repository, many basically entirely independent individuals?   You are simply grouping together all contributors as though they were part of one coordinated organization. Every proposal put forward goes through open discussion, and if proceeded with gets code reviewed and critiqued openly. All core developer meetings are held in public and their transcripts are made freely available. 
This twisting of the true facts to rationalize a fallacious assertion is a very big problem nowadays not just in crypto.  Conspiracies are claimed against non-conspiring groups, while small groups of clearly corrupt people behave as though they are the victims. Please don’t contribute to that.

Of course we can read about it in the other sub.  And we all have.  And a great many of us have unsubscribed from that sub because we find it toxic and full of liars.   You don’t have to come here to try to “inform” us of what we consider to be grade a BS.   When I talk about manipulating the truth I consider the proponents of bch to be repeatedly guilty.  They have a chain with less than 1 transaction every three seconds and declare their chain to be faster, cheaper and more reliable.  BS.  They make these false claims about the development of bitcoin, yet they merge them.  The straight out lies about segregated witness security is just that. The claims of censorship are a distortion of what moderation is.  And on and on.

I don't have a parallel universe to see exactly what would have happened.  However, if S2X had been implemented, bitcoin would have been finished.  S2X was this terrible back room deal, ineptly coded by a very technically and morally questionable individual.  Now, there was never much risk of S2X succeeding, precisely for those reasons.  
There is no utility or value in a bigger block centralized coin controlled by a handful of corporate interests and a sellout of a developer. 
Already BCH is the coin spun off by one or more of the untrustworthy participants in S2X that we would be required to trust if it had replaced bitcoin, rendering the system worthless.   
The value of BTC exploded upwards after the UASF success and again after the S2X failure.  The following surge in other coins' value is FOMO losers running around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to guess what's next and putting their money everywhere except for where they should be.  
I myself don't have any objection to purposeful and well planned and tested growth in the block size either.  But no way in hell will I ever run or even hold on to a fork that announces it has reached consensus when 12 jackasses meet in a hotel room and one of them actually betrays that agreement on the day of its first milestone.

12.5 BTC were recently lost when a block was mined without a reward address when someone was setting up a rootstock mining machine. It’s a non event though. I think there being a bounty out there of 1.25BTC now to try to hack lightning is a good thing.  A gradual growth with real world implications is the only sound way to grow these types of things.

I am somewhat surprised to see how inefficient the BCH blocks are now that there is transaction volume on that chain.  Transaction throughput is a lot lower than on bitcoin despite the blocks being larger.  Of the four 8 MB blocks in the graphic I uploaded, the highest had 1,428 transactions.  
Meanwhile the 10 bitcoin blocks mined in the same timeframe had a high of 2,969 transactions and four blocks with more transactions than that highest one.  
Despite a large number of transactions on Bch the transaction throughput showing on blockchair.com is still a very very very very very very low 0.42 transactions per second.

I’d like to point out that the hacks on Ethereum are because developers rushed software out, unreviewed because they were hasty, lazy and/or greedy.  The lightning network is none of these.  This is not to say it will be free from exploits with certainty.  However, with the DOA or any of the hacked ICOs or the parity multisig problems, the degree of carelessness in developing and releasing the software was jaw dropping to anyone with software development experience.  Work on lightning has been ongoing for a long time.  The attitudes towards security are so different in bitcoin versus the altcoins that a direct comparison is really highlighting the contrasts rather than the similarities.

Sure: 
* the current hash rate is 70 million trillion hashes a second (i.e. 70 quintillion).  
* A block is discovered every 600 seconds (ten minutes)
* So a correct nonce can only be found in one in every 600 times 70 quintillion, which is:
* 1 in 42 sextillion. or 1 in 42,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

The rules of the software create the coins in the block reward every time a new block is mined.  They are a valid entry in the blockchain because the rules allow for their creation this way.  They don’t come from anywhere prior.  They are created in what is called the “coinbase transaction” and every full node on the network accepts them as valid.

For sure bitcoin does not need Peter, but here's a what if scenario: what if he came out saying even "Okay, maybe bitcoin has a chance and you should put 5% of what you put into gold into bitcoin" or some variation on this: 
1) It will cause a "split" in his community.  He's got tons of followers/investors who have parroted his laughter at bitcoin for years.  They are hard core, and very few of them seem to have any open mind at all - it's like talking to flat-earthers (I believe).   
2) It will cause him shame for admitting to being so wrong for so long and then admitting to a mistake.  The whole premise of the "gold will come to dominate" thesis is its dependence on "eventually".  Like waiting for the second coming of the messiah, you can always say "wait and have faith", which is exactly what that camp has had to do for a looooong time now.

I am not very concerned about this as it isn’t what futures do.  Futures are financial instruments used to reduce risk by buyers and sellers of the underlying commodity.  If you grow corn, which will be ready in two months you may want to guarantee its price at that time to kick in a profit, even though the price may rise, because the price might also fall.  A buyer of corn, like Kellogg’s might want to do the same.  Hence the futures market allows them to contract directly with each other or indirectly through other market makers.   There’s more to it than this but that’s a good start. 
Now with bitcoin, the only people who make it are miners (although there are a lot of people who hold it and they’re not making anything else out of it).  We have no idea how the futures market will play out here, but why would a miner sell not yet mined. coins for less than current prices unless they expected a big crash.  
For one, I would not be surprised to see very little volume initially.  If anything I expect this market to be the place where people getting against bitcoin get rekt instead of on the exchanges.

The weak link in hardware wallets is, as stated above, the security behind your seed phrase.  If you are storing it somewhere unencrypted (which almost everyone I know who has a hardware wallet is) then a criminal stumbling across it who knows what it is will be able to steal all your coins on that hardware device. Keeping the seed phrase encrypted in multiple locations is probably your most secure bet.  Just don’t go around unencrypting it all the time. When lightning comes this will all change if you want to use it as it will require some online, Hugh availability machine with signing privileges to participate in facilitating network hops.

Aside from actually pinning posts to the top, which is visible to all users, mods do not have the ability affect which posts go to the top.  This is a fact of Reddit.  
The community over at rbtc has different users that vote for different stories.  Rbtc has mostly been a pro hard fork community and also a pro altcoin community. Long before I was a mod here I subscribed to that sub too but found it far too toxic and irrational and unsubscribed because I found the irrationalism there offensive and unuseful.

Mark Zukerberg was extremely patient.   Facebook rolled out at specific colleges only until it was ready to start scaling.  It didn’t even go public until 2012, 7 years after it started.  I don’t think the comparison is terribly good anyways.  The current challenge is building scalability into the decentralized system.  No other coins have done that yet.  They either have no scale to deal with, have the same scaling challenge, are vapourware, or are totally centralized and solve no problems of the already mature and widespread banking system.

As many theories out there as there are people you can ask.  Are you in it for the long haul or to try to make a quick buck?   If you think of these currencies each as a social network you can think of bitcoin as Facebook (the most users, the highest use, the biggest rand recognition) and other coins as other social networks.  There’s clearly no need for 1,300+ others but some that do something useful and different may be useful.  Note though that bitcoin can add most anything any other coin does through a side chain eventually, which may mean that it will eventually dominate all use cases except for some niche ones.  
Litecoin specifically basically just changed a couple of variables in bitcoin and most of its development consists of just copying and pasting bitcoin core code. You’re not really investing in different tech with it, just another version of it which is less in use, less secure and less battle tested.

See what bitcoin wallet apps you have on that computer.  Take a look at the last modified date of their wallets and compare that to the txid you have.

You are confusing two ideas (at least) - the price per coin and the quantity of coins.  Inflation refers to the quantity of coins only.  
1) bitcoins are currently created at the rate of 12.5 coins every 10 minutes.  That’s 75 per hour, 1800 per day, 657,000 per year. 
2) 657,000 our of the existing supply of about 16,700,000 is about 3.9%.  So that’s the inflation rate. 
3) when the next reward halving occurs the issuance rate will drop to 6.25 coins per block (or every 10 minutes).  
All of the above is true whether bitcoins are worth $1 or $10,000 or $1,000,000. Bitcoin doesn’t know that the United States exists and that it issues dollars and that people trade those dollars for bitcoins.  It just marches on doing what it does.

Gold was wickedly volatile for years once the gold standard went away. Or was it simply that the dollar was wickedly volatile instead?  In any event, despite being used as a store of value and sometimes as a currency over thousands of years Gold has bounced around, but generally appreciated.  I see no reason that bitcoin won’t achieve the same thing.  It would be amazing if we returned to an objective standard whether that were gold or bitcoin - assets that cannot be conjured at the whim of anyone.

Mining nodes are full nodes that are also generating blocks by attempting to solve the proof of work puzzle for that block. They probably all run bitcoin core or a slightly modified version (u/Luke-jr has a client called bitcoin Knots that has some improved mining controls among other features).  
Only valid transactions can get in the mempool of a full node.  That’s pretty much what a full node does - receive transactions and blocks and verify if they are valid.

It’s serious. 
Many alts have an irrational and nearly religious or ideological hatred against bitcoin driven from envy and misunderstanding.  But none are as severe as r/btc who are essentially of the belief that they are the “true” followers of Saint Satoshi and his holy words.  Instead of admiring satoshi for his genius and growing this system with more genius as the future unfolds, they have this on-chain orthodoxy issue which prevents them from realizing what will maintain decentralization and what will allow true scaling and speeding up of transactions.  It really resembles a religious cult to me.  You cannot reason with them, they are hysterical with rage over everything and confirmation bias/evasion are what they substitute for reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:37:58
The power used is a function of the price of bitcoin.  Miners invest in electricity as long as it generates a positive return on the bitcoins they mine. There is no way to change this without changing the very idea of how bitcoins are created and how the blockchain is added to.  
Schemes like proof of stake have not yet been demonstrated to be theoretically secure let alone proven in practice.  
Having said that the energy that bitcoin consumes can really be shifted to very green sources.   Nuclear plants and hydroelectric plants which produce zero greenhouse emissions tend to produce a steady output of turbine turning power regardless of the energy demanded of them and many operators simply divert their steam or flow away from the Turbines when the demand is less than peak.  Mining could draw on that unused power that could really be generated for free.

I guess you missed out on the biggest events of 2017 when the miners first said they wouldn't follow the SegWit rules and then said they would follow a 2MB hard fork.

This is true, and it’s curious to see how quickly comments are coming to attack decentralization as irrelevant based on fallacies such as “new users don’t care.”   The answer to that is that it doesn’t matter if they care or not.   If they buy into some coin that is controlled by one person or some oligopoly they will sooner or later experience the same results they do with fiat: an inability to store value and the necessity of making risky investments to get any growth in value (way out of proportion to the return). 
Today because of manipulation and naïveté, as well as riding on the coattails of bitcoin, people are making huge paper returns buying things that offer no advantages at all over fiat.  This will not last.  There will be tears.  The decentralized honey badger will march on.

Channel balances never change. The money just sloshes back and forth between the two parties.  If a channel was funded with insufficient funds to pay a tx fee on settlement, settlement can still occur by bundling it with another tx that does cover the fees.  


This is entirely up to the parties and the closing method. A closing transaction, with fees, exists before the funding transaction is ever broadcast to the blockchain. 


I do not think this is possible because of how bitcoin transactions work.  The transaction has its inputs and its transaction ID and these are not malleable so they can’t be increased or decreased. 


To a degree, yes, but the routing will automatically take care of this.  There is a much more complicated question and answer embedded in what you’re asking that is beyond my ability to answer. 


I will leave this to others more knowledgeable about the testing to answer.

Those answering yes are saying that if you redefine bitcoin you can define it as anything. But bitcoin resists redefinition because its definition is precise and requires consensus of all running a full node to agree to the same precise definition.

When you move bitcoin from one address to another that happens on the blockchain and that means miners have to mine that transaction and you will pay a fee. If you want to access your bitcoins on multiple devices without moving them you can do this by sweeping the private keys into the particular wallet you want to have the access.   In this case any device that has those keys can move those coins so all those devices need to be secured.  The best way to reduce fees right now are to use segwit addresses and know how long you are prepared to wait for the transaction to clear so you can pay a lower fee.  But by far the best way is to not churn your coins from one address to another for no good reason.  You wouldn’t move dollars back and forth all the time from one bank to another so don’t do it with bitcoin either.

I am not yet an expert on Lightning Network.  But I am trying to do some good thinking about it with some other intelligent acquaintances.  I do think the destiny of the network's decentralization simply, primarily rests in the hands of users and developers to pursue the creation and uptime of widely held, high uptime, highly connected nodes.    Easier said than done of course, but LN is open source and its design is all about routing across a decentralized network that parties can join in and out of.

We’ve been through this this year already.  A group of miners representing 80% or more of the hashpower said they were going to change the rules.  We told them to go f$*k themselves. They gave up.  Changing the rules means leaving the chain of users and mining a worthless altcoin.

The comparison to a company is always tenuous with bitcoin.  Nobody is hired or fired in bitcoin.  You join and leave voluntarily and are rewarded if you add value.  
The miners don’t define bitcoin because they mine blocks which are defined as valid by the users.  They can mine whatever definition of a valid block they want, but if it isn’t valid by the definition of the bitcoin protocol, it isn’t a bitcoin block. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:54:34
Bitcoin only requires that the previous block hash be referenced in the new block and that the block time be higher than the median time of the prior six blocks.  If the clocks of the two miners are different it is not a problem unless the time stamp is off by a lot more than that.  This allows for blocks to take time to propagate. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:37:14
In the last two years, the hash rate has gone from 9.6 million GH to 758.5 million GH.  That's more than six doublings, which is an average of a doubling every months.  However, 2015 itself was the slowest growth rate.  5 of those doublings took place in 2014.  
In the last 30 days the hash rate has gone up 65%, indicating another sharp spike in hash rate - meaning a 40% decline in the productive output of any given amount of hashing power.  
While my claim of monthly doubling was somewhat exaggerated, it is not entirely untrue, and it was entirely true when I lost a lot of coins investing in mining in 2013 when the rate did double every month.  
So I do stand corrected, but the point is still a very strong caution.  65% growth per month in the hash rate of the network means a big risk to future dividends of 40% declines per month.  Watch out if you're gonna mine.

In the above case that you describe, as you presented it, I would say the answer is "yes, this is the new consensus rule".  
Here's what I would add - what I mean in saying I will never leave consensus is that if there is a change from the pre-existing rules that I strongly support, I will absolutely not follow a chain that adopts that new rule **unless** that rule is adopted with consensus.  This is what I call the "grown up tradeoff".  I am not myself, for example, opposed to larger blocks per se, although of course SegWit is a block size increase, but I am absolutely opposed to any non-consensus based change including any non-consensus based block size increase.  Given my level of expertise, I am not able to judge fully the dangers of trying to do any block size increase beyond SegWit, so I will study all proposals carefully and ask as many questions of as many people as I can.  If I feel I have gotten to the point of being able to be expertly in favour of or opposed to one side, I will openly state that position.  But no matter what, I will not leave the consensus group.  My role may be to be a persistent advocate of a change, but never will I leave to start a different coin.  This is the human principle in consensus for me.  Changes must win by reason and persuasion.  I actually have nothing against people who do not wish to stay in consensus and want to start an altcoin as long as they remain honest about it being an altcoin, they are just pursuing different goals and principles than I am.

Mining is a losing proposition. Note the difficulty increases over time.  The difficulty doubles, and your reward halves roughly every single month.  For every Bitcoin you extract in month one, you will never in the whole of time see another whole Bitcoin. This is because the series 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 ... converges at 2.  Any investment who's dividend halves that quickly had better pay for itself in the first few months.  
Buy and hold and stay away from mining if your goal is grow the value of your investment.  The halving coming up this summer won't even be noticeable to you if you buy a miner now because your output will already be too small to bother with by June (a month where you'll be getting 1/32 of the mining reward based on monthly difficulty doubling even without the reward halving).  
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:30:05
This is not the he first time a core developer has saved an altcoin’s bacon. It is a tough moral dilemma to be honest.  Projects like BCash and IOTA have very questionable dev teams and dev practices and each time they are thrown a lifeline by luck, they get to evade the consequences of being sloppy without actually cleaning up their act.  This is bad for future users of their systems, who will eventually become the victims of such sloppiness.

His hypothetical solution is that miners should spend money on mining gear, but not activate it because they trust other miners to not activate their mining gear, thereby saving energy.  
There's just so much absurdity in this that I don't know where to begin.  Maybe we should all turn off our miners and just let me mine on my CPU.  But if you see me double spend then you all turn your miners on.
Now, he's talking about some alternative solution to PoW or PoS but I have not seen any information about that so I'll reach some conclusion about that when there is some detail to evaluate.

You know, the blockchain isn't that rock solid as a proof of **past** ownership.  It's a lot like bank balances that way.
If someone steals a $20 bill from you and then spends it at a store and that owner pools it with their daily receipts of say, $1000, deposits it at the bank that night and then withdraws $30 the next day and spends it, there is no tracing that particular $20 to any particular transaction he makes in the future.  Similarly, if someone steals 1 BTC from you, and they spend part of that coin and move the rest into a wallet that has other coins, and move that whole bunch of coins, it is very hard to say what "change" is that particular BTC.  The blockchain shows balances, not specific, individual coins.  
Tagging each individual coin or part thereof is something that the coloured coins project is trying to do, but the blockchain does not do that now in my understanding.
So if those coins were stolen long ago and combined with other coins, all there is is a bunch of balances in a bunch of wallets with no precise description of which coins are in which wallets.

Segregated Witness (aka SegWit) allowed for block sizes to be greater than 1MB when measured in MBs.  It was activated last August.
It introduced a whole new block size cap metric though, which is block weight.  Old nodes still see a less than 1MB block with the SegWit transactions appearing as only anyone can spend transactions.  But miners will not mine any attempt to spend a segwit transaction without the valid signature in the SegWit portion of the block.  And even if a miner tried to, every single segwit aware node on the network would reject that block (including that of every other miner) as invalid so that miner would have wasted their work and lost their mining reward.  
We had a big debate this time last year about activating SegWit.

There would need to be $75 million in MT. Gox, either from existing deposits or new ones to purchase $75 million of bitcoin (real or fake).
So it does not matter whether it was new money or not.  What matters is if he sold real or fake bitcoins (assuming this is what happened at all).  If he sold real bitcoins that belonged to other people, that explains the entire (publicly stated) shortfall.  Of course, we don't even know if 750,000 is the actual number of missing bitcoins, that's just what's been reported from a couple of non-verifiable sources.

It really is the worst possible outcome then:
Everyone who has a cash balance (much of it achieved by dumping bitcoins at $130) might see about half that money out after the expenses of bankruptcy proceeding (aka civil rehabilitation in Japan).  
Far worse is the outcome for people with bitcoin balances.  This statement says that those coins are gone and it does not attribute any monetary value to them.  The position implicitly taken is essentially that they are worthless.  If authorities help them recover the coins, then they will be returned, but the coins are not listed as a liability, only the cash.  And it seems pretty clear that the coins are not in storage with lost keys, but spent from the mtgox wallets.  They probably will be very hard to track, especially if the theft has been going on for years and they will have been mixed in with transactions into credible wallets (e.g. if they were sold on another exchange, or spent elsewhere).

Thanks for the concern, but this really isn't an issue with coinbase.    As to your points:
1. I learned the lesson with shared passwords back when reddit had all of its passwords and userids taken when it was around only 1 year old.  I have never since used the same password on two sites.  Nobody should.  And you should never log in to a site unless you are on an encrypted page.
2. Making the information to security questions available on social media is really stupid too.  
3.  Phishing and social engineering are not trivial.  And they are crimes.  If a firm somewhere succumbs to a social engineering issue based simply on someone having my email address (but not access to my email account) and my name, then I have been vulnerable to that attack since long before my name and email address appeared here.  
If you google my name and the word email you'll get my professional (not personal) email address, and my twitter handle from google.  This is seriously not a real security issue.

I had my doubts about BtcDanny for a long time.  Over at bitcointalk he played a big part in an as yet unresolved disappearance of over 6,000 Bitcoins.   
When Weexchange suddenly stopped redeeming people's balances Danny jumped in to say he would help fix the problem, and met in person with the Texas based owner of the service and alleged thief of the coins.  Very little of the coins were ever returned and both Danny and Ukyo have been radio silent for a long time.  The overwhelming opinion on that thread is that the coins were stolen by Ukyo, and that there is certainly no legitimate excuse for his continued silence about what happened.  For Danny to have gotten himself involved with this situation makes me think he lacks the proper judgment to stay away from bad things, and it is possible that he is also attracted to them.

Please share the transaction Id or your wallet address so that we can see what the deal is with the transaction. 
Sounds from the other comments here like you were light on fees which means you might have to wait until the transaction's priority grows. 
You want to watch out for a double spend which is that person responding those coins (using a higher fee) before your transaction is confirmed.  If that happens you will never get those coins. 
There is no risk to you in sharing your wallet address or transaction id.  Those are public pieces of information that are published on blockchain explorers to see what transactions took place, from and to whom, and when.

SegWit needs 95% hashpower to activate.  That's a huge amount of mining at a loss.  To reduce the current 65% that isn't signalling SegWit to &lt;5% you would need to have mining power increase 16 fold.  That's going to cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.

@_date: 2017-03-25 11:14:29
The more I think on it (and I have posted my reasoning on this subreddit) the more I think this is a zero risk option and that it should be released so that users have the ability to send and receive SegWit transactions on the main chain, mined by those miners who also activate this soft fork in the same way.
With backwards compatibility, all these SegWit transactions and all the blocks mined with these transactions, will be 100% valid.  Users who send these transactions might have to wait a little longer until a miner supporting SegWit discovers a block, but there will be lots more room for those transactions in a SegWit block and, anyhow, if the SegWit transaction is a Lightning Network channel opening or closing, that's intended to happen once a year or so, and it is therefore inconsequential if it takes 10 minutes or 40 minutes to settle; it's like opening a bank account, not conducting a single transaction.

The chain only ever splits when BU miners mine a block greater than 1MB.  When the UASF activates, users can send SegWit transactions and the miners mining with SegWit on will get those transactions into their blocks. Even without miner consensus about SegWit, SegWit is active and SegWit transactions work their way into the blockchain. 
While it sure would have been nice to have it, we don't need 95% of the miners to agree to SegWit.  
We only need the 25% of miners we already have to activate it via UASF and ensure that the transactions (eventually) get mined.  It might take an hour and in fact it might get to a standoff where only 25% of the blocks ever do mine the SegWit transactions.  That's fine.  Layer 2 solutions are totally cool with it taking an hour to open or close a channel that can will stay open for a year and conduct hundreds of transactions in that time. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:05:02
Ok. Just read about it.  I favour this too.  If we are going to be forced into a fork with two chains I am in favour of core support taking the initiative here to isolate and segregate the hard fork support.

Acting now will bring them to their knees.

As soon as UASF is released and adoption spreads, every miner will signal segwit, long before the UASF is activated. And any miner who doesn't switch before will switch quickly thereafter.  There may be a minor, low hash power chain that some run out of "principle" for some time, but it will be irrelevant with 90%+ of the network running core.

I'm not sure what purpose any of them serve other than to be a "me too" trying to attract people who feel they missed out on Bitcoin.  I know ethereum is trying to do something more than Bitcoin, but as I said above, I just don't see how DAPPs are useful and if anything, the DAO proved how difficult it is to execute anything of greater than minimum complexity.

If there are a lot of miners that support SegWit they can offer us an alternative to changing the POW, such as refusing to accept blocks that signal BU and don't signal Segwit onto the chain they are working on.  Even just throwing out 10% of BU blocks would cost BU miners dearly.  And then the threat can be turned up to 20% and so forth.  But if the miners don't help the cause then they are going to be casualties if the community is forced to change the POW because one miner behaved in ignorance and threatened to damage all of bitcoin.  If they need developer assistance to issue such a threat to the BU miners then I'm sure it would be forthcoming.

User activated soft fork.  
It activates, in this case, SegWit on user nodes.  They will recognize blocks containing SegWit transactions as valid. If this happens the miners will have to either discard blocks containing SegWit transactions and continue to work on the therefore shorter chain, or accept the SegWit blocks and continue mining SegWit. 
We do need some miners mining SegWit transactions of course, but we've got over 25% doing so already. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:16:44
There's nothing more to see.  95% of nodes now are supporting SegWit.  There will be lots of Sybils after this comes out but there is nothing to worry about.  If no miners activate SegWit support on the activation date then there will be no SegWit transactions.  If the 25% who now are signalling support activate then about 1/4 of the blocks will contain SegWit transactions.  There will be no chain fork - the remaining 75 of miners and every node still sees those blocks with the SegWit transactions in them as valid blocks with valid transactions.  This is enough for layer 2 solutions to thrive anyhow.  Even with a 1 block per hour rate of SegWit transactions it is enough for  now to support what we want from layer 2, like opening or closing LN channels which will remain active for a year or so at a time and who don't need access to the chain to do the bulk of their off-chain magic.  
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:08:13
SegWit transactions and the blocks containing them are backwards compatible. They will still be contained in the chains of miners not activating SegWit. Big blocks are not backwards compatible.  They will be orphaned. 
No problem for SegWit nodes frankly.  We can just activate it and have the SegWit transactions appear in only the blocks mined by the miners who've activated support for it. Meanwhile big blockers can hum and haw and make threats, but SegWit will be active and everything that relies on it will be able to be run.

Blocks being full also means Bitcoin value plummets, especially relative to alt coins that offer nothing other than a chain with blocks that aren't full.

But I think they'll need to see a very low price to wake up to that.

ETH is open source, and so are the smart contracts that run on it.  So anything running there can be run on rootstock when it eventually launches.  However, ETH is vulnerable (and even plans) to multiple hard forks, including ones where balances at addresses are changed.  Solidity seems to be prone to all kinds of vulnerabilities too.  
I'm okay to wait for Volvo to introduce a nifty new feature instead of buying a Lada with that feature.  I'm also willing to wait for bitcoin to implement features securely and sensibly on the largest network instead of rushing to an immature standard that has more problems than the solutions it offers.  
I can also see no material usage of any Dapp on ethereum.  They all seem like pump and dump token issuances.

I hear you but I think it is impractical.  I support segwit and I am prepared to run a UASF node, but I am not a developer let alone one with Bitcoin dev experience and so I am looking for multiple assurances of the code having been reviewed by core developers.  This is the trust that I have to put in the system because I do not have the skill to verify the legitimacy of the code.  A non-core UASF replacement to my core node brings me risks and complexity that I am unable to confidently mitigate. How do I support and use segwit and get the assurance of core quality software?

Anyone following the DAO with any investment background, myself included, smelled that the DAO was a disaster waiting to happen.  There were dozens of ways to get money from it eventually, the most obvious being to successfully get a proposal through and then basically spend the  money on yourself and ultimately to admit you failed at delivering, but perhaps not before asking for more and more money to keep the project going.
However, the hacker took the quickest and most lucrative attack vector.

This is actually irrelevant to the current Bitcoin dilemma - if SegWit were a hard fork and not supported by the miners it would fail because it could be attacked by them overwhelmingly.

Proof of stake is another matter. Obviously something profitable miners would be strongly against. Hard fork probably has other unintended consequences, none of which are good for value of ether.

All the rationalism in the world to argue why forking away what some people don't want to happen will not take away the fact that forks are a form of censorship and will end up becoming commonplace in ethereum whenever someone pleads a pity case big enough.

How can you defend a hypothesis that bitcoin is worth only $10,000,000,000, when individual banks are worth multiple times that and their deposits are in the tens of trillions ($10,000,000,000,000,000)?  Buy an amount you can afford to lose, but which will be material if it goes 10X in 10 years and hold.  But don't sell if it goes 10X, cause it could go 100X or 1000X.  
At $1 million a bitcoin, the total market value of bitcoin will only be $21 trillion when all bitcoins are finally minted in 100 years.  There's many times that money in fiat sitting around now, and none of it as reliable, secure, trustable and easily transferable as bitcoin.

You don't understand how it works. Miners ignore no fee transactions so you can't spam effectively with those.  If you spam at 10 sat/byte and users up their fees to 20 you have to raise yours to 30 to stop their transactions from getting confirmed. And there's a million bytes in a block, so your cost at 30 is 30 million sat per block. That's $1300 every 10 minutes.  But when you start pushing 300 sat per byte your cost is now $13000 every ten minutes.  And if the price of bitcoin goes up, those 300 million satoshis go up in price too.  (FYI 100 million satoshis equals one bitcoin).

There's that median time thing. It's not clock time when it activates but median time of the last 11 blocks.   Also, the first block of BCC could take a very long time to discover if significant has power is not directed that way (which it likely won't be).

It seems very unlikely that the hard fork will go ahead. There are no actual people running the client nodes and those that do run full nodes are overwhelmingly against a few miners and a couple of companies dictating changes to the rules of bitcoin for others.  
Moreover, bitcoin cash took upon itself the creation of a large block hard fork.  We can see how difficult it was and is for users to switch to it and we see how even companies who have declared support for NYA, such as coinbase, have not been able to support that hard fork.  
Give it a few weeks to see if we can get segwit utilization on board and some Lightning tests. Then nobody will have much interest in a rushed hard fork.

The philosophical clash between bitcoin and ethereum on the ideological level, not on the technological one, is going to forever separate the two, assuming ethereum is around for any period of time.  
The community there does not value any of the principles of autonomy, censorship resistance, irreversability or decentralization that are the core reasons why Satoshi created bitcoin.

I think this is a very interesting problem to discuss, and even more interesting will be watching what happens in the real world.
The truth of the matter is that Lightning has protections against this.  If large centralized hubs develop and they are compromised, it is an inconvenience, but will not lead to any loss of funds.  
It is very hard to see the fine details of the future with high clarity.  Lightning Network is a brilliant solution and being able to bring it to Bitcoin, especially via a backwards compatible soft fork was also brilliant.  
Of course, everyone will imitate bitcoin once it demonstrates that Lightning Network works well.  There will always be copycats and imitators and they will always grab some share of the market.

I agree we must stop name calling and stick to facts.

Ethereum is having lots and lots of problems.  They are working on their 3rd hard fork this year, all since July.  There are papers being published regularly identifying different exploits and anti-patterns.  Yesterday their official blog indicated a bug in all but the current versions of the Solidity compiler that could lead to exploits and other bugs in already deployed (and unstoppable) smart contracts.  In short, the system doesn't work very well.  I think they have just about proven that it is not a good idea to put complex code into a blockchain.  A much better solution is to have  a blockchain to store values and various applications that run the logical code of the app on a decentralized basis and can be easily patched/upgraded and stopped by users.  I compare bittorrent, Tor or openbazaar to everything running on ethereum and note that it is much easier to use all those things on a fully decentralized basis and to protect them against hostile attacks.
@_date: 2016-11-27 13:11:24
A node is any device that is connected to the bitcoin peer-to-peer network which runs its rules.  A node receives and validates transactions and also passes these transactions on to other nodes.  It does the same with mined blocks.  A full node contains the entire blockchain. Any miner must run a full node in order to be able to ensure they are mining valid blocks.
As long as there is one full node mining anywhere on the Internet, bitcoin runs.  Of course, the idea is that the more that run, the harder it is to stop the system.  But if I was running the one and only node and then you started one of your own, and I lost interest and shut mine down, bitcoin would march on.

Bitcoin is the state of the art in applied cryptography.  It is the largest private-public key system in the world, and continues to find valuable application for all the latest discoveries in cryptography.

@_date: 2018-06-07 15:34:55
Unless you are a miner with 51% hash rate it is very hard to double spend.  And anyhow, as answered elsewhere, the scaling of this to the level of where people are buying things in stores regularly will utilize lightning network, where transactions are instant and irreversible.

What's interesting is that when bitcoin was at those levels (and higher), I never considered it real.  Everyone was saying that they couldn't get their money out of Mt Gox and it was all just a death spiral of buying in and out trying to get some liquidity in either BTC or USD, none of which were going to ever happen. In my mind, the real high - the high you could get your money out at was $650.  That then fell to the mid $400s and it's been up ever since.

Lots of good points here.  I for one think that it is more likely than not that there will never be a hard fork that is widely adopted.
Scaling, if it comes, will require some off-chain solution.  Right now that looks like Lightning, but 1, it needs SegWit to work, and 2, it's a use case for people who already have bitcoin, not those who want to buy.
Meanwhile, scaling is not necessary for bitcoin to be a "Store of Value" solution better than anything else in the world, and that is what is driving its price right now.

Ethereum is programmable **fiat** currency, which has policy change after policy change with no visibility or reliability for holders.  There's no integrity in the principles and they move from one silver bullet fix to another without considering the consequences of each fully.  It is the worst of all the altcoins that are taken somewhat seriously.  
The consequences of these actions have been devastating not just to its price, but to its user base and its credibility.

Neither debater said anything particularly convincing.  Barry's investment hypothesis is not based on a technical or game theoretic understanding of bitcoin, but instead on a social theory alone, which is that young people will desire it over gold.  This is actually true, so although he's missing a lot of the fundamentals, his investments will pay off long term.  But he can't debate for shit, because he lacks the knowledge to describe why Schiff is mistaken about his claims such as Ponzi, requires too much energy, no intrinsic value, etc...

if the output is spent then the public key is in the transaction script and is available to both the receiver and every other human being on the planet with access to the internet.  This is why address re-use is cautioned against.  As soon as you spend from an address its public key is revealed because the public key must be revealed to verify the signature.  
If the output has not been spent and you have the address you can use bitcoin core's command "validateaddress".  Simply open the console type validateaddress and then add a space and then in quotes put in your segwit address.  You'll get a bunch of output, but one field will be the pub key.

Let's go slow, because you're new and you said you don't speak english well.
First, your original transactions shows 1 input of .006 bitcoins.  
Those 0.006 bitcoins were sent to two addresses.  .002 btc went to 122BiXP39JUWy93krLTt47y7Sw8e77zCN5 and .003104 went to 1JZsotQQojgwC78ZHrn77oSWLVyW3tSbG2.  The remainder is what was paid as a fee.
Now, how did you create this transaction?  What wallet did you use?  Because the wallet you used would have needed to know what that address was.  So either you gave it that address, or the wallet generated it because it was a change address.

That’s not how market cap works. 
If $1.9 billion came into the bitcoin market right now it would drive the price up into the hundreds of thousands of dollars a coin.  
Market cap is the product of all coins outstanding and the latest price.  But at the latest price there are only about 100 coins on the market on average at a time.  You want 200 coins you gotta pay a higher price.  You want 1000 coins? Right now on coinbase you’d have to bid $800 above the current price and that alone is $800X16.7 million coins or a $13 Billion increase in market cap that would only eat up $10,500X1000 coins or $10,500,000 of that $1.9 billion.

Show me the transactions on Bcash.  They’re not there.  This is merely off chain betting. Experienced users know where to look.  The Bcash blocks are tiny because the Tx volume is tiny.  And the 100MB backlog of spam on bitcoin is exactly why we need to keep the block size small - because if we had 8MB blocks that is the rate at which we would get spammed by attackers.  That bitcoin users don’t actually spam other Blockchains is a testament to our discipline and confidence and integrity.  That pumpers of big block forks do spam the bitcoin blockchain is a testament to their need to seek validation not on their own merit but on attacking others.  But it matters not because the technology of bitcoin simply treats these attacks as an irritation.  If some newbies are manipulated into joining the cult of bitcoin cash that is a shame, but there has always been and probably always will be an alt to suck in suckers. It’s just that that alt has to keep changing when its promises prove to be broken ones.

A private key has only one public key associated with it - that original change address in this case.  By providing another address you must have created another transaction and sent it to that new address.

Big mistake.  The solution already exists.  It is called Lightning Network. It is ahead of its time. The market right now wants a cryptocurrency that can be used as a foil against debasement of fiat currency.  When the awareness, demand  and, most importantly, acceptance of and for bitcoin is such that everyone wants it, Lightning stands ready to fulfill the whole world’s demand for transactions with the same security and scarcity promises of bitcoin but with nearly unlimited throughout constraints.  However, this level of acceptance is still years away.  Bitcoin has only been worth over $100 billion for a week or two.  The world will need to see stability for at least a year or maybe several before everyone will accept bitcoin.  Patient holding is what most users are signing up for, and that’s what will cause a steady and reliable appreciation. That’s why no alt can show up with a fancy **new** technology and expect to supplant bitcoin.  The market doesn’t want the **new** thing.  It wants the proven, secure, scarce thing.  Unlimited inflation, fast blocks and Turing completeness, along with a huge premine (Aka ethereum) does not provide scarcity (unlimited supply) or security (huge, oft exploited attack surface and hard fork to malleate the blockchain).  Pay attention to what counts. Google won not because it was pretty, or because it used some new kind of unproven database tech, but because it gave the market what it wanted in a search engine - accuracy (page rank) and speed.  Yahoo blew it because it focussed on less important factors.

You’re totally safe if you use the default settings.  Let’s say you have 1 btc at one address in your current “hodl” wallet and you want to move 0.1 to a spending wallet.  When you send that .1 btc to the spending wallet what actually happens is that you use up the whole bitcoin at the original address and send .1 of it to an address at your spending wallet and the remaining 0.9 of it to a new address (called a change address) in your hodl wallet. Generating new addresses is the default behaviour of all wallets, it costs nothing and it actually increases privacy.  
You’re all set and safe as long as you keep your private keys (and seeds) both private and not lost. 
Do you want some advice on how to do that?

There will be no fee for sweeping a key.
  You are not making a blockchain transaction when sweeping a key.  You are simply importing the private key for a public address and therefore giving that wallet ownership of any coins at that address.   But if someone else also has those private keys they can also spend any coins at that address.  The private key is the only permission you need to spend coins at the corresponding public address.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:02:48
Yes.  This is how public key cryptography works in general.  The public key is something you make public and reveal to the whole world, while the private key is what is used for decrypting messages that have been encrypted with the public key and for signing messages linked to the public key.
In the old days of bitcoin, the public key was the address.  Now, as an added layer of security it is the hash (of a hash) of the public key that we use for addresses, so that you can keep even your public key secret until you need to spend your coins or sign a message.

Future off chain transactions, which is where the majority of transactions will take place, will not pay fees to miners.  This is in fact why miners are trying to draw users away to a coin that has disabled the underlying code to support off chain fees.  Mining will Continue to secure the blockchain itself though and the rewards will be highly valuable bitcoins along with the fees for getting on and off the off chain layer(s).  Difficulty of mining will continue to adjust so that one block is discovered every ten minutes on average.

The community should not lose this mindset.  Gold is a good store of value but a bad currency.  The US$ used to be pegged to gold and created an ecosystem where there was a good currency pegged to gold.  But that promise was broken. Bitcoin is a good store of value like gold.  Better even in fact.  And its second layer will not be government backed promises, but mathematically backed promises - ie Lightning Network.

I’ve heard this a thousand times.  Despite this “scaling” problem millions of transactions and billions of dollars worth of bitcoin traded hands at light speed yesterday.  That’s because the chain is not where high speed high volume transactions take place.  They take place off chain. In fact for Bcash, they had billions of dollars and millions of txs yesterday too and they had even less on chain txs than bitcoin by a factor of 10.  
Now, off chain txs today do not offer the same security guarantee that on chain transactions do, nor the same privacy.  But that’s where the Lightning Network will step in and create an off chain layer that has the same security promises plus even greater privacy.  If you can’t wait for it and think you need a bigger block size or faster blocks you’ll learn the hard way that scaling isn’t about getting 8X the transactions or 10 to 40 times the tx confirmation speed. It’s about getting unlimited transaction volume each confirmed in milliseconds.  
That’s what we are working towards.  Sorry it isn’t ready yesterday.

And I would add that this is not as easy as changing a variable from 1 to 8 or as writing sloppy, rushed code where everyone’s funds can be stolen or permanently locked.  
Bitcoin is where serious development effort by over 100 developers, architects, code reviewers and testers takes place all the time.  If you acquaint yourself with the bitcoin’s github you will see the huge amount of developer activity taking place just at the core protocol level. 
And that doesn’t even include the lightning network which has had huge amounts of development taking place on it and has high quality for alpha software running on testnet now, testers posting daily bugs and developers fixing them daily.  This is how software actually gets built.

This difficulty adjustment concern is pure fud because difficulty is about to get 1.3% easier.  That is such a small number it’s nearly negligible in terms of block discovery times. 
Please be aware that there are lots of freshly generated fake accounts whose sole purpose is to pump altcoins by creating fear that bad things are about to happen to bitcoin.  Bitcoin has had 100% uptime for years on end despite countless attacks. A teeny difficulty adjustment has no bearing on this. 
Meanwhile the same people behind the accounts spreading fud are manipulating the price of the alts they are pumping.  These alts often have few holders and low floats.  For example, most BCH is locked up in accounts in cold storage, coinbase, other third party holders, etc.   Only a small amount of it is circulating.  Its pumpers hold a large part of that small circulating supply and actively bid it up on foreign crypto exchanges where there are even fewer sellers. That is the trap they set for people like you.  They try to make you think you need to get in on the rise in that alt and as soon as enough people have bitten on that trap they let the price collapse again and wait for you to panic sell those coins. This exact thing happens all the time.  
If you are buying tightly held altcoins because you are concerned about bitcoin you’ve probably been mislead by someone trying to get your money.

@_date: 2017-11-11 16:35:26
It’s been said many times.  The plan for bitcoin is to create off chain scaling solutions.  Part one of this was segwit, which miners - the very ones behind Bcash - held up staring it would make bitcoin fees unfairly low.  Part two is create layer two solutions that make secure, anonymous, lightning fast and ultra low cost transactions.  It’s nearly here which is why the fee seeking miners are trying to pacify the impatient with a block size increase on a chain that has removed segwit and the ability to actually scale. Suckers gonna get suckered. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:59:24
The short answer is no.
A valid transaction is a signed message.  If the order of the content in the message is changed, then the signature will be different also.  Only the owner of the spending address can generate a valid signature.
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:27:38
Not at all.  It will take time. My thesis here is that first you must be a store of value, then a medium of exchange. If bitcoin was a great medium of exchange when its total value was a few tens of millions of dollars it would not suffice to be a good global medium of exchange.  
But as a $120 billion+ store of value adding a medium of exchange layer atop that money supply will allow it to become the world’s reserve currency. 
First though, become the world’s most secure store of value. Next, become it’s reserve currency. 
Originally the US$ was the second layer on top of gold. Gold was the store of value and US$ were fast moving, quickly circulating, light notes that were claims on gold.  But that promise on the US$ was broken.  
Bitcoin is digital gold.  Second layer solutions, probably lightning network, will serve as an unbreakable promise to make a currency layer atop it.

The miners have jumped ship to Bcash three times already because of its EDA.  We are a day or two away from its difficulty jumping by 40%-100% and then it being more profitable to mine bitcoin and then the hash power returning.  Plus bitcoin’s difficulty also adjusts.  Adapting to hash rate fluctuations is built into the design.

Interest is the price of money: "You want money?" the lender says.  "Sure, I'll give you some but you have you to give me something in return.  How about more money later?"
That makes sense.  But suddenly we have an unprecedented and irrational situation where the lender says "You want money? Sure, take some of mine and give me back less later and we'll call it a deal."  It costs the lender money to lend you his money.  He'd have more money if he held on to the money.
Of course no rational lender would lend at a negative interest rate.  Unless that is, he is threatened, or is participating in some scheme where he is borrowing more than he is lending.
And this is where banks find themselves when central banks impose negative interest rates.  First, by law, they often are forced to lend at a rate only a small spread apart from that of the central bank who has set a negative interest rate.  And, in the pursuit of profit their own profit, since the central bank is prepared to lend banks hundreds of billions of dollars which they now don't ever need to pay back in full, they're quite happy to borrow more than they lend.  The more they borrow the greater their profit.  This perverse new way to make profit, without having any customers and without providing anything of value to anyone is not what you build a sustainable economy or currency upon.
Now, I've not actually seen any negative interest rates myself, but you can rest assured that wherever they show up, if credit is widely available, inflation is sure to follow as borrowers borrow like crazy to buy stuff that they only need to pay back a fraction of, and this increased buying with no increased production will bid up the price of things - especially real estate and stocks.
The simple message is don't hold a fiat currency whose issuers are mandating negative interest rates.  It is a shell game to make it appear as though the economy is growing (since real estate, gas, stocks, bank profits, etc... will all nominally be going up), while in reality irrational allocation of capital and savings destruction are the only things taking place.

I'm not saying that old money will disappear altogether soon.  But it will be irrelevant to those who don't want to be a part of it and that will be an increasing number of people each year.  Fiat money is inferior to bitcoin because it's inflationary by design.  It is crippled in one of the most important criteria of money - store of value - by design.  So people, when given a choice will chose a better version of money.  BTC isn't really better enough on the dimension of being accepted everywhere yet, but it will be and I think that will be faster than what you seem to think.  Not 100 years, not 30 years, not even 10 more years.  New technologies are getting adopted faster and faster.  All BTC needs is a few tipping events that make demand for it high.  I predict that next year by this time we'll see hundreds (out of hundreds of thousands) of homes sold for bitcoin instead of fiat.  That will filter down afterwards to other large purchases and within five to ten years it will have quietly and invisibly become ubiquitous.  People didn't see the Internet gain share as it gained share of time.  I remember newspaper executives in 2004 telling me that the Internet never took off the way consultants told them it would, and all the while they were checking their emails and messaging on their Blackberries, which were wearable computers that wirelessly connected them to the internet much more frequently and thoroughly, and at greater expense than the consultants they were laughing at.  They simply didn't realize that the internet had taken over their lives.

Why is there change?  This is question with a long answer.  
Here's my briefest explanation.
Every valid bitcoin transaction (except the ones that create new coins as reward for mining a block) basically spends the full value of one or more previous bitcoin transactions. 
In your case, it took the transaction that had 0.006 BTC in it and spent that full amount - sending .002 to your friend and the rest back to you.
There are two reasons to do this: one is speed/efficiency and the other is security.
From the efficiency perspective, by spending the entirety of each transaction the blockchain is kept smaller and easier to find values in.  There is no math to do - there is simply the amount at the addresses of unspent transactions and nothing at the spent transactions.  No program has to find your 0.006 and look up to see how much of it is spent and subtract that from the 0.006.
From the security perspective, by sending the change to a brand new address rather than a previously used address you are doing two things: 1st, concealing who got what from observers of the blockchain (i.e. a random observer wouldn't know which was the sent money and which was the change).  And 2nd, by sending unspent bitcoins to never before used transactions, the security of those addresses is even higher than for those that have been used.  When you use an address to send you cryptographically sign a message from it and disclose its public key.  This is generally safe to do, but it is theorized that when they are invented, quantum computers could solve the private key from the public key.  So the addresses we use are quantum proof hashes of the public key.  This means that even if you keep your bitcoins locked at an address that has never spent anything, even quantum computers can't steal those coins from you.  And that's why by default we have programmed bitcoin wallets to make sure that all coins sit at addresses who have both secret public and private keys and share only a hash (of a hash) of the public key.

First, love the quote about ignoring reality. A paraphrasing of an Ayn Rand quote to give credit where it is due. 
Second, we shouldn’t jump to the conclusion that we need a hard fork because for 36 hours the price of bitcoin has gone down instead of up. If one is necessary one will happen.  But you can’t undo a hard fork so we need to be very cautious about implementing one.  It’s very much a stretch to suggest anything is too late or will be any time soon.

Here’s how it works:
A very small amount of Bcash is actually in circulation.  Many users don’t know how to access theirs or cannot access theirs.  And many who could access theirs dumped it into the hands of those now pumping it.  So the market is not actually very liquid to begin with.  
Next, because the supply in circulation is low and there are few sellers the pumpers bid the price up on a foreign no fee exchange that has even less real supply on it.  They are basically buying it from themselves at apparently high prices.  
Their goal is to trick rubes in panic selling BTC for BCH out of fear that something bad will happen to bitcoin of out of fear of missing out of their phoney flippening.  Try keep raising the price of BCH until they get some outside buyers of it. 
As soon as some real people come in and buy some BCH at these inflated prices the pumpers basically have sold their free or cheaply acquired BCH for a huge premium and they stop artificially buying BCH on the exchanges causing the price to crash again as soon as the panic triggered buyers run out of real bitcoin.  
The final step is to sometimes repurchase the reduced price BCH from those same victims, who now end up having lost 50% or so of their bitcoins.

There should be several posts about this coming up.  Many of us want to dump S2X coins for bitcoins. There’s a lot of possible outcomes of the fork and the exact approach(es) to do this aren’t 100% clear. 
I for one think the most likely scenario is actually that there will not be a split and that you will not need to nor be able to do anything. But I don’t think that’s a 100% certain outcome. Be patient and monitor this subreddit.  And don’t panic.  This is a long term outlook we all are taking.  This New York Attack is a milestone in bitcoin’s history and will set a precedent for decentralized technology.   It should not be evaluated on the basis of what happens on day 1 or week 1.  Fighting off an attack of this magnitude might take a little longer than that. Or the attackers might capitulate.  We shall see.

Your transaction is fine.
It was confirmed in the blockchain on November 16th.
The second output is called the change - it's money that went back to your wallet because you spent an input larger than the amount you sent.
Now one of the two outputs, the one with .002 bitcoin in it, has actually been spent.
It was spent on November 25th.  If that's the amount you sent him, either he, or you (since you actually have that address in your wallet) or someone else spent it.  
Anyhow, that money now sits at address: 1KBP4XDSyZio9AmXmuqJTBBb4sjKinv6Ny (less the fee spent to move it).

Exactly one month ago it was $4,800. So if you’re upset about the price zoom out a bit.  But it’s clear to me that there is a well coordinated attack on its price that was part of the plan for when S2X failed.  
Bitcoin will always be under attack. That’s what being the top currency is.  It’s the same way as counterfeiters and robbers targeting primarily valuable fiat currencies.  They’re always out there. 
This attack will run out of gas and money soon enough.  It might be today, next week or next month or even in a few months.  Look at what happened to ETH this year.  It pumped up to $400 and had everyone pumping it calling for a flippening.  What happened?  It’s gone sideways since bouncing around.  It’s pumpers still pump but the naive fanboys are now lured into Bcash because its marketing story is very effective at scaring newbies.

If you post anything even remotely neutral you will be immediately down voted.  There are only hysterical posts there.  Its purpose is strictly to pump BCH through the creation of FUD about bitcoin.  It is now only even trying to fool newbies.  
Look at the recent FUD spread about the difficulty adjustment which was a non event and was completely misrepresented.  There was a 1% adjustment coming and the person running that subreddit made it seem like all hell was about to break loose.  This may have gotten some naive noobs to buy BCH or sell BTC, but it will also have taught them a lesson, and only a new set of noobs will be fooled by whatever lie is concocted next.  
I do think we're getting to the end of the long BCash pump.  There's not enough fools left to fool.  The pumpers will move on to pumping something else.

There's so many variables at play that I think it's important when putting forward theories like this that you try to state assumptions and what you're holding as equal in your estimations.  
In thinking about price in fiat here are the variables that I think are involved:
- Total number of bitcoins actually potentially circulating (as opposed to lost forever).
- Issuance rate
- Cost to produce new coins
- Total amount of fiat units in circulation. (Note: if fiat crashes to zero it looks like a bitcoin, gold and silver singularity too.  Maybe we should be looking at bitcoin price in ounces of gold?)
- what is being used as currency in the world? (Fiat only, fiat and bitcoin or bitcoin only.  Again, a world in which fiat is abandoned has no concept of a bitcoin price.  It's like asking what the price of a dollar is in terms of dollars.)
- Most complex, however, is what is the migration over time among the population to the use of bitcoin.  There isn't a switch that's suddenly flipped.  These changes take place over years or decades.  The chaos during the times of change is what leads to wild swings in both directions for price.
I don't claim to have a good model myself.  My own investment/speculation/commitment in bitcoin is to hold whatever I have until it does become the world reserve currency - it's a ticket to financial freedom in a different financial world than the one we live in today.  Even at $10,000,000 per bitcoin I would not trade my bitcoins for fiat, because that's not the purpose of my bitcoins.  In your model then, I'm a permanent holder, but not because I never intend to spend my bitcoins.  Simply because I never intend to trade them for fiat.

Quantum Computers *may* break Elliptic Curve Cryptography which is the underlying address mechanism in bitcoin.  They will not break hashing which is what mining is based on, what transaction IDs are based on and what current public addresses are based on.  So in fact bitcoin as is, using the default settings of not reusing addresses, is already quantum computing proofed.

1) it's easy to encrypt your wallet with a strong password you can remember and then to back that wallet up in multiple places (google drive, dropbox, email attachment, etc..) where it will be available for many years.  
2) You heard wrong.  The blockchain is a part of bitcoin, not the other way around.  What you heard is like someone saying that the automobile is not a good investment but the internal combustion engine is.  There are other applications for the internal combustion engine, but the automobile is the killer app.
3) You purchase someone sending bitcoins to the address which only you hold the private keys to.  You're paying to have an entry in the blockchain that confirms that.

Yes.  There is a plan.  It is being implemented. The enemies of bitcoin scaling know this is their last stand to attack it on grounds of on chain capacity before we get off chain scaling that gives unlimited, instant, low fee transactions.  This is why miners support a modest on chain block increase because it keeps fees on every transaction.  When lightning kicks in most transactions will have micro fees or no fees at all.

As soon as off chain scaling was announced miners saw it as a threat to fees since they want a cut of every bitcoin transaction.  They held up segwit to try to stop it.  They paraded that imposter Craig Wright as a proponent of big blocks.  They funded Ver’s sub shilling campaign and they created Bcash. 
Miners have become the middlemen bitcoin was created to avoid.  And they behave exactly as you would expect 
This is a desperate attempt to turn the rejection of their attempt to take over bitcoin into the appearance of bitcoin’s failure.  Anyone fooled into joining the losing side here will regret it eventually.  The miners will come back when they lose the battle but the people who followed them are following a dead end.

The problem with S2X is that although you get a coin on the new S2X chain for every coin you have on the bitcoin chain, they have made it so that if you try to spend on one chain, the transaction will also occur on the other chain.  This is called replaying. 
This service is intended to allow you to split the coins on the two chains so that you can hold on one and spend on the other, for example.   S2X is the first hard fork of bitcoin to not offer this natively, which is the main reason many people view it as dangerous or reckless and could lead to people losing money.

It is alleged that banks are interested in this technology because it will help take lots of time, cost and risk out of their system.  
It takes a long **time** for inter-institution transactions to settle because they have to verify the authenticity of the sum of transactions between each other and deliver the actual funds.
It **costs** a lot to do this because there are often middlemen and many middle systems implemented over the last 70 years, which are awkwardly integrated.
There are many points of trust that have to be negotiated carefully which creates a lot of **risk**.  
All that said, however, it is the financial institutions themselves who are the cause of delay, cost and risk.  Individuals in the industry who do understand how a decentralized system works are usually also quick to realize that there is little need for many of their most profitable services in a world where there is widespread adoption and utilization of currency that can be securely stored and transferred without any middlemen.  
The nature of the disruption is so severe that few bankers understand what is going on and fewer still can even draw parallels between what they do and its counterpart in the crypto world.  For example, right now, if you write a cheque to someone they have to take it to a bank to have the funds deposited into their account.  The bank the cheque goes to has to validate that your account has the funds in it, that your signature is authentic and they then have to demonstrate to the bank holding your funds that they are in possession of the cheque.  This is what takes a long time.  In bitcoin, if you send me coins (a transfer from your funds to mine, signed by you) you simply broadcast it on a network, and every node can validate instantly whether you have the funds and have an authentic signature on the transaction, and every miner competes to be the entity that confirms your transaction and settles the transaction.  All this happens in about 10 minutes (or an hour if the blockchain is under spam attack).  The banking system might hold a cheque for 4 to 5 business days; and that's if the funds are staying in the same country.
So I think the banks are interested because they would like to take their costs out, but they are terrified because they themselves are costs that we can take out.

1. Huge technological attack surface (successfully exploited enough to lead to 3 hard forks last year)
2. Built in ticking time bomb (they call it a difficulty bomb) that must be defused via hard fork by developers every so often or the whole system will cease to operate, thereby leading to a user base of only worshipers of (and ultimately sheep of) the developers.  The thing in hijacked by design
3. Huge social attack surface with all these tokens being issued and pumped and never paying out a penny - identical to dotcom craze of businesses that never generated a nickel of real revenue, never generated a profit or dividend, and ultimately destroyed huge swaths of value.  
4. Vitalik is a very strange character - many of his writings are incomprehensible and indecipherable, yet his followers openly declare things along the lines of "I have no idea what this means or how it works and I thank you for doing it."  These are the words of fools who rely on blind faith instead of independent reason.  History is full of people like this ending up without money.  And in fact, it is a direct connection to how Jim Clark (founder of Netscape) ended up getting funded for all kinds of crazy ideas that cost billions and wound up going bankrupt without generating a dollar in revenues.  Read the book about this called "The New New Thing".
Now, if your rebuttal is "The price is so high, you must be wrong, logical", my rebuttal is the high price phenomenon is exactly what lead people into investing in these dot coms back in its bubble.  The Nasdaq has just this year regained the value that it had lost over the last 15 years from the dotcom bubble, and not because those doctcoms regained their value, but because companies like apple, Facebook and google had created all the real value.

@_date: 2017-04-07 10:43:43
I personally find merit in all three choices.  
The UASF is the ballsiest choice, because there is a lot that can go wrong with it in the short term.  It's a war of two chains and is similar in some ways to the Ethereum hard fork from last year where it was the core developers who favoured the new rules over the old.  It took time, but the new chain won, although it had majority miner support from the outset.
Stalemate is a bad long term risk because it draws energy away from improving bitcoin.  Within bitcoin there's endless infighting and outside of bitcoin people are lured away because of the infighting.
Compromise is plausible as 2MB is probably not so big a change as to cripple decentralization.  I myself don't think we need 2MB blocks if we get segwit but I don't get to decide what Jihan Wu does.  In the long term, decentralization and low fees are maintained if off chain scaling solutions catch on.  There is a bad precedent to be set for future forks in that miners may ask for something political rather than platform beneficial.
I want to discuss these options but am not coming out strongly in favour one yet.

The only way this is possible is if you get a miner who is signalling segwit to agree to receive your transactions privately and mine them privately.  If you broadcast your transactions on the p2p network all nodes, including those run by miners who aren't signalling segwit will receive the transaction and can mine it.  Also, a recipient of such a transaction will not be able to see it until it has been mined, since it is unbroadcast.

Your connection to reddit via HTTPS goes through many hops, not directly to reddit, but the information is encrypted along the way.
It is possible, but not currently in what has been proposed to add a layer of logic that would make the information about the transaction confidential to parties that were hops along the way.  
Why do you think the LN is not peer to peer though?  The routing of your transactions on it goes through peers that act as intermediaries and not even every transaction between you and the same party would get routed through the same intermediaries.

So it could be that bitfinex is keeping the price of tether up by selling bitcoins they hold.

It became intolerable to read that sub something like 8 to 10 months ago.  It is a one-issue sub, which isn't even prepared to have a discussion about the one issue it's about.  Many subreddits like that go toxic.  
What's interesting is that it somehow got all up in the mind of a powerful person in the bitcoin space - Jihan Wu.  
Again though, we are seeing the true nature of Bitcoin's anti-fragility.  The risk of a Jihan Wu initiated hard fork is realistically less than 10% now (and probably close to 0%) as he has seen that initiating his hard fork will only lead to the 90%+ of nodes that run core ignoring his invalid chain.  
Meanwhile, weak hands sold their BTC at low prices, some for crazy altcoins, and will soon be scrambling to get back in.  And those that fail to get back on the train will suddenly become zealots for ETH, ETC, DASH, XRP, Litecoin, etc... because they've foolishly tied all their wealth up in there in networks with a small user base, unreliable code, unreviewed code, massive pre-mines, and so on.

But bitcoin sends the transaction to every single node and records it permanently in all of them.  That surely is not what you see as the Tor model?  Why is the routing of the transaction important for you if after the fact the entire details of the transaction are made publicly available and easily searchable from any computer in the world via explorers like blockchain.info?  Am I missing something?
In short, you don't like the google talk model because, I'm assuming, you don't want google to have a record of your discussion.  But you are missing the fact that every single on chain transaction in bitcoin is entirely public for eternity.

In the analogy I use to media, the World Wide Web came on the scene with Mosaic and shortly after Netscape. That was around the 1995 timeframe. It's been 20+ years since then and while there are still newspapers and tv stations, their valuations and audience share have been decimated.  And the new media companies called Facebook, google and snapchat are worth more than all of the traditional ones combined.

You make a mistaken assumption in saying that LN is the only hope we have of scaling.  It is merely a second layer of trustless peer to peer payments. It may be a little less secure and a little more private when it matures, and support way more transactions.  
However it is not the only way to scale.  The fiat system didn’t scale because we found ways of giving actual paper money at high speed globally.  It scaled on third party custody (banks and other institutions) and electronic promissory notes in the form of sql databases.  
Bitcoin can (and in a sense already has) scale like this too.  Imagine you give Visa a bitcoin to hold in your name and they give you a debit card, which they let you use anywhere with any frequency with any merchant they have.  If you want what you have left back they let you withdraw it. This is how fiat has scaled.  We have inserted trust and created organizations whose incentives have made them act in a trustful manner - or at least a legal one - most of the time.  The failing in fiat is that the governments and central banks have taken it upon themselves to randomly change money supply and regulate interest rates to intentionally reduce the value of fiat in hopes of achieving certain outcomes (re-election, economic stability, economic prosperity, inflation control, unemployment targets, favourable exchange rates for international trade, etc....)
With bitcoin, this monetary policy is out of the hands of government and as such the value of money is preserved.   We do not need an irreversible, publicly recorded record of every purchase in the world, which is what the proponents of unlimited block size actually advocate for.  
Right now, few people are spending bitcoin, but that will change and no blocksize increase will handle that.  However, even those who do buy often let custodians hold their coins, despite those custodians being exchanges which, as a group, have not been terribly good at holding coins without getting robbed or losing those coins.  But we do have much better organizations stepping in.  Fidelity (and others) will soon offer a custody solution and a reliable custody solution tied into the existing world payment networks provides instant, worldwide Visa size scaling with mass merchant acceptance.  And it actually provides a format of refunds and dispute settlement that has been market tested and determined to be very attractive to consumers all over the world.  Irreversible is not what we want in 100% of transactions.  But it is useful for those who want and need the certainty.  
The future is filled with all kinds of uncertainty and unpredictable disruptions.  But bitcoin is far from restricted to scaling on the chain or through LN alone.   These can be intermediaries between even higher level and higher scaling solutions with different rules to suit their purposes.  The example I give above is simply an easy to imagine one, but not necessarily how the market will evolve.  It is just there to show how easy it is to create high scale alternatives with different (and for some use cases, better) promises.

To be clear, if the UASF activation date is August 1st, then what will happen is as follows:
1) nodes running UASF will reject blocks which do not signal for segwit.
2) nodes not running UASF will accept blocks which do not signal for segwit
3) miners running UASF will reject blocks which do not signal for segwit.
4) miners not running UASF will accept blocks which do not signal for segwit
5) as a result, there will be two chains as soon as the first block is mined that does not signal for segwit.  
6) ... anybody's guess what happens after this.  Either a) the non-signallers surrender and begin signalling; b) the UASF activators surrender and follow the non-signalling chain or c) there is a drawn out battle between the two chains where transactions on one chain can be replayed on the other.   
If UASF has more than 50% mining support at this point then those miners can build the longest chain and essentially force the other miners to their knees.  This is because the longest chain will be all segwit signalling blocks, having rejected the minority quantity of blocks produced by those making and accepting non-signalling blocks.  
Segwit still will only activate after the UASF forces 100% of blocks on its chain to signal for the required time and then allows for the 2016 blocks to activate.

The whole of Ethereum is open source. So anyone can make changes if they are a skilled developer, but you need EVERYONE to go along with a change that is a hard fork, which is what is required to successfully activate a hard fork without having two separate chains. 
If the developers abandoned Ethereum that would not be a big concern(because some developer could come by to eliminate the difficulty bomb) but while they are involved they carry a weapon that prevents the status quo from proceeding if they want to make changes that suit them.  
The other concern about Ethereum I have is that it does not make sense how it will ever scale should there actually be applications on it that large groups of people use.  Right now, any successful web based service, like Reddit, runs on many servers.  Ethereum needs to run all of its applications and record each and every state of them forever on each and every node.  There's just no way that architecture can scale.  So unlike the dotcom boom where there was some chance all of these sites would succeed, there is a physical physics based limitation on how much utilization of CPU and disk storage the whole of Ethereum can handle.  Vitalik talks about some workarounds such as sharing, but those hardly provide the kind of geometric or exponential scaling that would be needed if you had a single app like Reddit running on it let alone the whole decentralized future internet.

If we are going to do this we have to think about what the risks are and how to mitigate them. 
We cannot have a UASF without the support of a significant amount of mining hash power.  There is currently about 30% signalling segwit and another 30% signalling nothing. 
In the most optimistic case a binary of UASF is released after review by enough core devs and enough of us run it that we get enough of the non signalling miners to signal so that segwit signalling becomes around 60% and we can be certain that the uasf segwit chain will be longer than the one running without UASF.  This will force the hand of all miners who aren't signalling because all their blocks will get orphaned and there will only be one chain. At 60% segwit signalling a UASF is a no-brainer. 
But at less than 50% there will be two chains and there is no replay protection between the two chains (yet that I am aware of). Both chains could live on or one could die and transactions could be spent differently or the same on either. This will cause huge problems and make it impossible to trust in Bitcoin while both chains are vying for dominance. It really does become a war at that point with Bitcoin being the heaviest casualty. It is unpredictable what could happen in such a war.  The opposing miners could surrender if nobody bought their coins. But they have deep pockets and will not likely just acquiesce.  
If we do want a UASF to succeed with minimum damage, we need to persuade another 20-30% of the mining power out there to start signalling.  The prize for them  is a larger share of blocks until Bitmain surrenders.  
And this is only in the short term.  Bitmain will be plotting their revenge if they lose this battle with no face saving out.  And they do have the power to exact some kind of revenge.

I read his article as saying that personal financial gain at the cost of personal integrity is not a worthwhile trade off. I agree. I myself don’t hold it as a principle that bitcoin is the only valid project out there, but I have yet to find another one that I would stand behind or put my name to.  
There’s so much distasteful stuff that goes on in this space, but bitcoin itself has shrugged it all off, while every other coin’s elites have sold out their integrity at every opportunity. 
I’m so proud of bitcoin’s community because we have fought tooth and nail and been prepared to take on all adversity to keep this project honest. Last year was more about segwit, UASF and No2X than price. We came out of it as white as the driven snow.  That ICOs and ripple and Dash happened is all temporary noise. When we zoom out in the future we will see that the integrity of people like Rusty is exactly what made bitcoin a success. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:30:04
UASF was not a part of the reference client - ever.  The community developed a modification in response miners' refusal to activate segwit and ran it.  There is no version and there never was a version of bitcoin core with a UASF in it, yet over 11% of nodes were running it before the miners and the other big companies responded with S2X, which totally gave in to the UASF.  So it's safe to say that the community  likes the engineers behind the reference client and we took on the responsibility ourselves to ensure that the features in there we wanted got activated, even in the face of those who I call powerful bad guys.

I disagree that the comparison is the same.  Scam emails are all intentionally scammy.  However, it has proven to be incredibly hard to write smart contracts when the intention is honest.  This is due to the complexity of the environment and the adversarial nature of cryptography.  Cryptography is **Very VERY HAAAARD**.   The whole history of the field is about trying, often unsuccessfully, to prevent adversaries from exploiting the attempts at achieving security.  
From my observation, bitcoin takes this issue **Very VERY SERIOUSLY**.  Extensive testing and having the best people in cryptography developing and reviewing everything.  Again, from my observation, ethereum takes this issue with far too much of a cavalier attitude.  This whole subthread is because an ethereum person showed up and said it's "trivial" to create LN.  Nothing new in cryptography is trivial.  **NOTHING!**  It is a huge mistake to assume so.

The users have all the power.  They choose to buy and hold coins on the chain(s) they want and to sell them on the chain(s) they reject.  
Developers can maintain a chain or fork it and miners can mine one chain or another, but without users these choices will amount to nothing. 
That said, the developers working on bitcoin core are actual principled and passionate users of bitcoin.  
The miners are resisting bitcoin's primary principle of decentralization because they are pursuing high market share of block rewards and fees.  And the companies signing this agreement are NOT BITCOIN COMPANIES but are cryptocurrency companies whose revenues grow when people trade bitcoin for other currencies.  They want volatility and more altcoins and chaos.  Those companies and miners have found common cause only by entirely rejecting users and developers (who are also users).  They are enemies of bitcoin's users and are trying to make it into something where they have power.  All they will succeed in doing is jerking each other off.  Users will reject their betrayal by rejecting their chain. I hope they suffer significant economic losses by having their efforts here shoved right up their asses.

Did the two multisig contract examples we’ve been discussing not suffice?  I don’t want to get into the semantics of “ethereum is secure but the smart contracts that run on it and are developed by the top ethereum people aren’t” debate. I’m not a security expert guru and I can depend on bitcoin contracts, limited as their functionality is.  I cannot do that with ethereum contracts.  Many of the ICOs have had their funds stolen, the Dao was a huge debacle.  I don’t even follow ethereum closely and I am reading about exploited contracts quite regularly.  
I understand the tradeoffs people are willing to make for the functionality it brings.  That’s ok with me.  But when it comes to an application like LN, which is advanced contracts for moving money off chain, I **know** it’s not trivial to make this work and test it and I see the typical lackadaisical attitude to simplicity without testing in your original comment about implementing in ethereum.  
There is simply a much higher weighting placed on reliability in the culture of bitcoin.  We don’t release code unless it’s thoroughly tested because we don’t hard fork to fix bugs because non-malleability of the blockchain and irreversibility of transactions is a principle that we won’t violate.  And the reason for that is that we want government free money.  Ethereum wants something different - something I don’t entirely understand myself, but which I don’t fault others for my lack of understanding or buy in.  But when it comes to something like LN I wouldn’t for even a second consider some complicated smart contract written in solidity to be able to secure off chain receipts and channel states.  You go ahead though if you feel it’s safe. 
Joseph Poon, the coauthor fo the LN white paper is doing work on ethereum but he’s not doing LN on ethereum.  I don’t want to read too much into that but it’s pretty reasonable to see that that idea is designed for bitcoin style blockchains.

For the record, I wasn't only talking about price, when I referenced recovery.  Credibility, community alignment, expectation of bitcoin not actually dying, etc are also factors.  Bitcoin's antifragility is being more widely recognized and as such panics about it being killed by one thing or another are much shorter lived.

I have no idea if the following is true, but it is a plausible theory in my view (and a reason to sell BCH before it crashes):
The spam attacks which were the only reason the blocks were full were expensive for whoever was behind them, but that party had a plan - pump altcoins and fork/take over bitcoin.  
The altcoin pump was very effective.  When miners began to signal for Bitcoin Unlimited instead of segwit, bitcoin's "dominance" (its share of the total crypto market cap) fell from 85% to 50%.  
Part two of the plan went sideways when Bitcoin Unlimited proved unviable and the UASF movement demonstrated that SegWit would not be blocked.  
Whoever it was behind this attack then desperately pulled off the BCH fork on the day that the UASF was due to activate - thereby creating further confusion and adding to the altcoin pump.  
Greed and powerlust had those parties propping up the price of BCH with their gains from the altcoin pump, but they have spent themselves out and the price is slowly sliding relative to BTC. 
As the chain is practically abandoned (virtually no transactions) and miners keep leaving it due to the low price, there is no stability in its block discovery time and it is clearly becoming an abandoned shitcoin but with an absolutely stratospheric market cap.  A 90% decline relative to bitcoin is entirely possible over several crashes.  There are no fundamentals indicating it should increase in value relative to any of the top 10 coins in fact (and some of them are pure shit too).  
So sell that shit while there are still some funds supporting its value. 
PS, if I had to guess the perpetrators of the manipulation seem to be Jihan and Ver or whoever it is that pulls their strings.

I think the article is saying that bitcoin is backed by the security of proof of work without getting into the complexity of the math or comparing it directly to other monies. However it does pose the challenge to readers at the end to compare bitcoin to other monies by themselves.  A good exercise. 
But to take your literal interpretation of “backed” what is it that the presentation of bitcoin can get you?  It can be traded for a transaction on the most secure ledger in the world, the blockchain - and you don’t have to trade the whole thing, just enough to cover the fee at that time. So bitcoin is backed by a network that provides the most secure ledger in the world, which is also fraud free, counterfeit free, censorship free, identity free, etc...

A pruned full node is fine.  The reason is it will only receive new blocks  that adhere to the current consensus rules and it will reject all blocks that violate those rules.  Therefore, nobody can trick you by sending to you a B2X coin in a B2X block, because your pruned bitcoin core node will say "That block is bullshit and so is every transaction inside it".

Empty blocks, block discovery times that swing from 6 hours to 1 minute, low trading volume: BCH is an unused, improperly functioning altcoin.

So if anything it serves as a demonstration of what a shitshow the 2X fork is bound to end up as.

A short term loss of hashpower is a small price to pay for maintaining decentralization. If we are going to hand complete control of the platform to a small cabal of miners and businesses who can maleate the consensus algorithm and therefore the UTXOs, why bother having bitcoin at all.  Cryptocurrency is only valuable if a &gt;51% attack does not successfully launch. This is as explicit an attempt at using hashpower to attack bitcoin as we’ve ever seen.

The miners activated segwit because we told them we would reject their blocks if they didn’t. Simple as that.   That was the agreement : mine segwit or we’ll ignore your blocks and reorganize your chain out of existence.  They did as they were ordered to.  And they’ve profited from doing so.  Now, some people, like yourself, seem to be under the impression that because they did this they can then get whatever else they want to done.  That’s not the agreement.  The agreement is they can mine on whatever chain they want and I can run whatever chain I want.  They will mine the most profitable chain because they want the most profit.  Why would they care if it’s one megabytes or two?

Ethereum does not have reliable multisig or multiaddress inputs and outputs, which are the very basics of even creating and funding a channel.  To create lightning on ethereum is not copy paste.  Note that nothing is trivial to create with security and reliability.  On ethereum the simple multisig contract which was thought to be trivial was first exploited as being anyone can spend with tens of millions of dollars stolen and then frozen with hundreds of millions of dollars still stuck in it and in need of a hard fork to release the funds.  Don’t say that something on the order of LN is trivial. It’s attitudes like that that lead to massive value loss.

I already clarified that I should have used the phrase "roadmap and process" and elaborated on both, so I think we're going in circles.  You won't get a comprehensive roadmap on all aspects as you've defined it on a project without central control.  There is no 'product owner' for bitcoin.  There is no president.  There is no owner.  There are only contributors.  This is analogous to the fact that there are no servers and only peers.  It's an unavoidable part of decentralization. 
If you have a project that has a roadmap which is inviolate you are probably looking at a project with central control.  And if it is open source and valuable you will probably see it forked by people who envision a different roadmap.

In the sense you are asking the 21 Million limit is a socially reinforced limit.  The code of bitcoin clearly sets out that there will be 50 coins per block for the first four years of blocks (50 coins * 4 years * 365 days * 24 hours * 10 blocks per hour = 10,512,000 coins).  Then this amount halves for four years and so on.  That series converges to 21,024,000 at infinity.  That's all the coins that will ever be mined in the bitcoin that Satoshi created **and the bitcoin that everyone who bought bitcoin took to be the number**.  So now, if some miners come along and hard fork a change, everyone knows that this is not what everyone else bought into, and everyone who wants to continue to enforce the original hard promise of the 21 million will continue to run the software that requires that issuance algorithm to be honoured.  Even if the miners have 100 times as much hash power as the rest of the community, the miners will only be able to mine on the existing chain to stay in consensus with the holders and users who stick with the original limit.  All the miners can do is create an altcoin with a huge number of coins, which has already been done by Ethereum, Ripple, IOTA, etc...
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:12:22
This is wrong. The best way to economically support the mining of the chain you like is to buy and hold those coins. That drives up the price and creates demand for that coin to be mined, making it more profitable to mine than another altcoin. As a result, profit maximizing miners will mine that chain. Let them take the capital risk and operate and industrial efficiency in markets when power is cheap, but pay them to do the work you value.

Too complicated to explain to a 5 year old but I’ll do my best to keep it as simple as possible. 
SegWit2X and BCH are both attempts to take over the code development and the ability to run nodes away from the community. 
Behind both of those initiatives are miners.  Not little guys mining in their basements or on their desktops, but huge industrial miners who build or run data centres full of mining equipment. 
If you read Satoshi’s white paper there is a four paragraph section titled “proof of work” where he says “Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote.”   He assumed every user had one CPU.  But ASIC technology means that a CPU is basically useless in mining.  And ASIC datacenters now do the overwhelming majority of the mining.  Bitcoin itself remains decentralized because anyone can still run a node and the miners are not in control of the code that the nodes run. 
But the miners are trying to take over the code through these efforts.  
In what is a serious case of gall, they are actually claiming to be pursuing Satoshi’s vision in doing this even though they themselves are abominations to Satoshi’s design of bitcoin.

You may be too financially committed and misinformed to open your eyes and mind to the notion that on chain scaling doesn’t deliver the scale we need and creates bloating that harms decentralization. 
With lightning in full public alpha on testnet now peer to peer, secure off chain coin transfers are about to become a reality.  Yesterday nearly $4bn of bitcoin alone was traded off chain in the various exchanges.  The number of trades was probably also north of a billion. That off chain volume however is not secure and not peer to peer, and it’s used only for buying or disposing of other currencies. When it can be used in a peer to peer manner, with the security guarantees of the underlying blockchain, which is exactly what lightning does, the scale of bitcoin goes from a quarter million transactions a day, not to 4 million transactions a day which is what an 8 MB block size does, but to tens of billions of transactions a day; with greater privacy, instant confirmation times and lower fees.  We’re taking about thousands to millions of times greater scale. 
The analogy I see is that you are saying “if instead of delivering a one page newspaper every day we delivered an 8 page newspaper every day we’d achieve information scaling” and the core developer scaling solution is saying “let’s create the internet to achieve information scaling”.

What I mean by reliable is, at the very lowest threshold, the funds aren’t all stolen or locked.   That ethereum wasn’t able to do either of these last year with multisig causes me extreme concern when someone declares something that requires multisig as a primitive to be easy. 
The fact is that it is much harder to analyze the security and predictability of ethereum code - so much so that a newbie sent a kill command to the ethereum multisig contract and permanently locked the money of everyone who was using it.  
Anyhow, this discussion probably belongs somewhere else.  I don’t claim to be an expert on ethereum actually and am inducing my concerns by looking at actual facts on the ground rather than through trying to understand every aspect of a system that has been demonstrated to have security flaws with which I am personally uncomfortable.

This is very unlikely to be an individual.  It is far more likely a multisig/segwit holding address for some exchange. Every transaction to it is a consolidation transaction with very many inputs.  
If one person came in and bought $400 million worth of bitcoin in a month it would drive the price to new highs.   And the supposition must also be that this person bought about $800 million worth of alts because they bounced back in price too.  It’s just a ridiculous hypothesis. 
 But let’s humour this hypothesis for a minute and assume that some individual multi-billionaire decided to pick up $400 million of bitcoin since the January crash while we had a near equal capitulation from former holders.  So what?  So there’s a billionaire with a huge amount of bitcoin who is interested in seeing it hold value.  Maybe he sold a bunch of gold to get it?  Maybe he sold a ton of stock to get it.

@_date: 2017-10-28 00:57:22
I’ll try to give you a quick explanation. 
Digital signatures as used in bitcoin are part of public-private key cryptography, (also known as asymmetric cryptography).   
The first step in this crypto is to generate a pair of keys, one which is the private key and one which is the public key. 
There are many uses for this key-pair, but one is digital signatures.  Any message can be “signed” with the private key without revealing the private key. The signature produced is a string, which can be put into an signature verification algorithm along with the a message and a public key.  If and only if the signature string corresponds to a the identical message and the private key corresponding to the public key then the verification algorithm results “true”.  Otherwise it results “false” and give no more information.  
In a bitcoin wallet you are given both a “sign” and a “verify” feature.  You can sign any message with the private key of any address you have the private key to.  You can also verify any message, address, signature combination given to you.  You can try this out yourself with any decent bitcoin wallet.  
And here is a mind blowing thing for you since you didn’t know what a signature was: every bitcoin transaction is just a signed message of the sending address identifying the transaction in the blockchain that it is spending and the amounts and destinations to which the coins in that prior transaction are being sent.  When you send a bitcoin transaction you use the sign algorithm.  And the above is also how every node knows whether a transaction is valid. Because it is verified using the verify algorithm. 
Cool huh?

People mistake Erik’s use of calm language and proper grammar for open-mindedness and reasonableness. Erik is eloquent but unreasonable on this matter.  His rationale for staying in S2X is that he keeps his word, but in saying that he is ignoring the fact that the S2X agreement, intended to maintain one chain by giving something to both core supporters and big block supporters was broken by the big block supporting miners who created and mined Bcash and now have a big block bitcoin that forever makes it impossible to have one chain. Many here, myself included, spent months wasting our breath trying to reason with him.  A huge shitfest is headed towards bitcoin and it’s because there’s a hard fork without replay protection that he continues to support.  Anyone sensible would withdraw support and divert effort to a hardfork that is well planned and actually does have the support of users, developers and miners, no matter how long that takes.  Instead, forging ahead quickly on a fork that does not have the support of users and developers is simply bad and wrong. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:04:28
I don’t think Bcash is a joke/pathetic just because they pursue a different path than me.  I think they’re pathetic because of their pathetic modifications to bitcoin that now has their chain wildly swinging from 1 minute blocks to 6 hour blocks, and because there are nearly no developers working on it, and that they intentionally removed a fix for the transaction malleability bug, and that they are aligned with convicted felon and proven liar, Roger Ver, demonstrated fraud, Craig Wright, and the untrustworthy Jihan Wu, plus of course that although every bitcoin user was given Bcash, the transaction volume on it is negligible compared to bitcoin’s.  It is a coin created by Jihan to keep his covert AsicBoost advantage and all fees on chain at the expense of users, developers and progress.  It is a stage for stroking the egos of fools like Ver and Wright who have been kicked off the stage of bitcoin for being liars and fools.  Pathetic hardly begins to describe it.

You can sweep your private keys into an electrum or core wallet straight from blockchain.info.  (Steps to do this are published on their site.) They'll still be there in blockchain.info's wallet, but if they somehow abandon the original chain, you'll still have them in a wallet following the original chain.   This will also be true after the split.  If you want to move them to show blockchain that you are against their support of 2X, you can do this, but it's not necessary for your security.

Actually, at this point in history all that we need is for people to buy bitcoins and sell shitcoins (which includes fiat currency).  Miners will act to seek wealth and they will want to mine the most valuable, liquid and profitable coin. 
We have learned a lot this year, and people underestimate what BCash tried to pull off so they write that off as a small attack, but in fact it was a brilliant attempt to switch mining power and value away from bitcoin to an altcoin:  
- it successfully, at times, had as much as 50% of the hash power mining on it (thanks to the clever EDA which has allowed it to avoid total death over a dozen times, and comes only at the cost of slightly increased inflation - so it is a sensible "life or death" measure).
- it became instantly more valuable than litecoin and remains worth more than double litecoin at the time of writing this comment
- it spent many years building up a community filled with hate and misinformation towards bitcoin before launching
- it assembled all the top "villains" at the time to back it (I refer to them as villains, but in their world they're of course the champions and visionaries)
Now compare it to the New York Attack.  Many of the same "villains" are involved in that attack.  In fact, as far as mining is concerned, it is the exact same group.  
Note that the NYA miners are the same ones who mined BCash like crazy when it was more profitable to mine it than bitcoin, **even though they were planning on taking over bitcoin through the NYA**.  Profitability is not an important factor driving the majority of the hash rate, **it is the only factor**.  
As long as people don't attribute high value to another coin though, miners will direct their hash power to bitcoin.  
And this is why we don't need an PoW change.
Today's bitcoin communities are overwhelmingly aware of and supportive of a decentralized bitcoin, with awesome developers, great security and transparent processes to modify the code.  Nobody who isn't corrupted wants the B2X coins.  Everyone knows that they're worthless coins because they're centralized development with coordinated mining attack coins.  
You'll get 1 B2X coin for every bitcoin you have.  Is anyone with a brain going to sell their bitcoin for B2X?  If they do, it's at great peril - because if B2X succeeds it means crypto is worthless; just another corporate instrument.  But since nobody will buy this coin, it's value will be shit and miners won't mine it.

If you go to the homepage of blockchair.com (yes chair, not chain) you will see on the homepage a tx/s counter.
It shows bitcoin at 3 and BCash at 0.05 (at the time I'm looking).  The ratio of BCash to bitcoin then is 1.6% of txs.  
That's one example besides my suggestions to look at fork.lol and cash.coin.dance/blocks for seeing the tx throughput on Bcash.  Because there aren't great tools out there for Bcash you'll have to do some math yourself to confirm things.  It's easier though to do now when blocks are hours apart than after EDAs when blocks are seconds apart.

The fact that splitting creates a split in value for the same amount of work means that miners are damaged financially by a split.  The same work that got you a whole bitcoin before will only get you either an S2X coin or a bitcoin with reduced market value.  It would therefore become unprofitable to mine very quickly if a split occurred where there was significant value in both sides.  Miners cannot hold out for long if there is value on both sides.  
This isn't BCash with an emergency difficulty adjustment where the hash rate drops to 5% of bitcoin difficulty every couple of days.  To mine real bitcoin means to put in real work.
Miners have big bills to pay and they can't work just as hard for less reward.  
This is why they think they need 90% of the hash rate to pull of the fork in the first place, but if the market doesn't follow the hash power then the hash power will have to follow the market.  
Take a look now at BCash and you will see that **the market absolutely does not follow the hash power**.  When mining hash power shifts to BCash, there is no appreciation in the price of BCash.  But when it becomes profitable to mine BCash, hash power follows profitability.  So **miners follow the market**.  Which is exactly as it should be and no miner should be chastised for mining on the most profitable chain.
Isn't it obvious then that S2X is going to be the chain that dies?  All you have to believe is that we won't have users and speculators thinking that it is the long run winner, and selling its price down.  Look again at BCash - a large block fork of Core to see this.  The actual utilization of their chain is negligible.  There are a few thousand transactions a day there while there are a few hundred thousand transactions on bitcoin.  The same will obviously be true of BCash (although they will be trying to replay bitcoin transactions on their chain to give the appearance of it being used).  Nevertheless, when B2X trades at a lower value than BTC (and it already is in these derivative tokens) miners will withdraw hashing power from that chain even though they signed the S2X agreement.  This is exactly what they did when they put hash power against BCash when it became more profitable to mine (because its difficulty was reduced by 95%).  
The net result is that B2X dies a relatively quick death in under one month as it spirals into reduced value and reduced hash rate.   
This is an amazing outcome that demonstrates how the incentive systems and game theory in bitcoin prevents a miner initiated attack from being sustained because it ends up being against the miners' economic necessity to sustain the attack.

Anyone can fork bitcoin any time.  The fact that nobody will follow their forked coin is why nobody bothers.  It is why this attack is an attempt to trick light wallets into following the fork.

Did you sell your bitcoins for Bcash?  If so, SFYL.  Not quite too late yet to buy back in.  You can at least see that if bitcoin is forked again all focus will be on the two variants of it and not on Bcash, can’t you?   It will be yesterday’s news soon ( if it already isn’t). Perhaps there’s someone around to pump it once or twice more, but really, the only hope it has of staying in bitcoin’s shadow at all is if the 2X fork never happens.  Should 2X happen all the press and attention will go to which of those two is the real bitcoin. Hash rate will even further be removed from BCash to spread against those two.  
PS there are a lot of factual mistakes in your rebuttals above that you only believe because you are trusting the word of demonstrable liars. That’s a choice you’re making and you will have to live with the consequences of that choice if you don’t smarten up and act in ways that truly correspond with reality.  You can’t lie your way into making math that doesn’t add up work. (Eg nobody will create channels that can be hostaged through malleating the txid of the anchoring transaction since it is such an easy attack vector.  But nobody needs to create lightning on Bcash since it has no users or transactions short of miner distributions of block rewards of wildly accelerated block discovery times).

Segwit addresses are P2SH addresses. Those have been around for ears. They can send to and receive from any addresses on the system. Segwit uses a different transaction format and that’s how miners and other nodes can see it is a segwit transaction. Miners can ignore these transactions or any others for that matter.  There’s only one miner out there not mining segwit transactions though and that’s roger Ver, who I thought wanted bigger blocks but I guess he only wants them on the other chain, which he’s not mining exclusively because he doesn’t want to lose more money.

I don't deny that there are some people who prefer S2X.  The opposition is mostly coming from the perspective that the end does not justify the means.  Do you not consider the means that were utilized here to be more important of a (negative) factor than the ends they try to achieve?  The precedent of a backroom deal forced through by refusing to offer replay protection and tricking wallets is so bad a precedent that even if I supported 100% of the S2X proposal technically as being 100% better than status quo, I would oppose the agreement on the basis of how it is being pursued.

Bitcoin is a secure store of wealth.  
- It is a ledger that requires tremendous energy to add entries to.
- it is a currency that requires a tremendous amount of energy to create new units of.
- it is a currency whose number of units issued cannot be raised no matter how much energy is used
- It is a ledger that only owners of coins can make entries on, and the only entries they can make are ones to hand over their coins.
- Nobody can take anybody's money on this system.
- Nobody can take over the system
- The more people that realize the above the greater the demand for bitcoin grows
- There's lots of other factors but these are the most important in answering the question.
There's tremendous amounts of energy and technology backing the use of bitcoin as a store of wealth.
In comparison to all other known methods of storing wealth it is far superior:
Gold is simply a scarce metal.  More of it can be mined.  It can be stolen. It is expensive to store.  It is hard to subdivide.  It is hard to send.  It takes a long time to send it anywhere.  There's nothing backing gold's value but demand for it.
Fiat money is designed to be a bad store of money.  It is created and governed by mysterious organizations who openly declare that their policy is to reduce its value through inflation.  It is backed by nothing.  Its supply is entirely arbitrary based on the decision of complex, bureaucratic, human, political organizations.

I think maybe you should take a deep breath and relax.  
Letting the market decide is absolutely legit, but saying that letting 51% of miners decide, which is what the revised coinbase announcement says, is not letting the market decide.
It's a shame so many people are caught up in NYA.  What do you make of the fact that it turns bitcoin into a one part time developer project?  Do you care?

What Garzik and Silbert have done is deplorable.  This isn't really about a hard fork that is good for the community at all.  It is explicitly about creating "existential threats from hard forks" (which is a quote from Garzik's announcement about his ICO, which Silbert invested in secretly before the NYA, and which they both withheld announcing until just yesterday).  
How Silbert thinks he can get away with this is beyond me.  Does he really think everyone can be bought for money?  He's just become the top villain in bitcoin - literally trying to destroy it and tear it apart as a demonstration of the potential utility of some vapourware ICO he's invested in.  
Silbert is honestly lower that Craig Wright, lower than Roger Ver.  The lowest of the low.  Scumbag extraordinaire.   Exposed by himself, as an attacker who lied about his attack and presented it as a "compromise" to bring people together.  Piece of shit.  Garzik is no better.  Piece of shit.

Right now, every new block adds 12.5 new bitcoins and gives them to the miner who discovered the block.  This is known as the "block reward", and the transaction on the blockchain that captures this reward is called the "coinbase transaction".  (The reward and transaction also include the fees users pay for transactions, so it's almost always greater than 12.5 bitcoins).  The original block reward was 50 bitcoins per block for the first four years of bitcoin, then it was half that, 25 bitcoins, for the next four years, and now we're in the third period where it is half that again at 12.5 bitcoins.  This bitcoin creation algorithm ensures that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins created.

I added the bold above.  This is 100% false.  The two chains is not a temporary phenomenon but a **permanent** one. 
Also, later down in the release they say they will support only the chain with the “most accumulated work” meaning that if miners support the B2X chain with just one per cent more hash power merchants won’t get bitcoins from coinbase, but will instead get shitcoins. 
Transact at your own risk with coinbase.

This is a fair question.  I should have been clearer and said “process and roadmap”.   
Bitcoin is an open source project where many developers come and go, offer to take on specific tasks, many of which are their own ideas, get feedback from other developers, review each other’s code, and finally merge tested and developed code into release candidates.
The development of new features, like everything else in bitcoin, is itself also decentralized.  In that sense there is no formal roadmap.  
If you search for bitcoin core roadmap on Google you will see the long term scaling roadmap which is what much of this contentious debate is all about. There is overwhelming support for this roadmap within the community at large. The whole of the resistance has been lead by a few chronically bad actors.

2017’s altcoin and token bubble went from March to June. That bubble started popping at the end of June. 
The bubble was triggered by a perfect storm of the SegWit activation battle in bitcoin and opportunistic greed of conmen shilling alts onto naive newcomers. 
No particular event took place to cause that bubble to deflate.  Basically the number of suckers fell off and the value of shitcoins and tokens diminished due to decreased funds from losers.  But that bubble still has a long way to go down. Most ICOs on ethereum will be total failures. Ethereum will go down (although probably not to zero) as those dreams come crashing down.  This will probably start to happen quickly after the third, fourth or fifth of the ICOs blows up and people realize the same is going to be true of all of them. 
But there are still a lot of people invested in the deceitful stories of some of the alts.  Not surprisingly numbers two and three, ethereum and ripple, have the most deception in them (although BCH is pretty deceptive too, just that its deception will take far less time to be realized).  
The ethereum “world computer” narrative is appealing on the surface but both technically awful and extremely low on practical utility.  Ethereum’s value is just a derivative of the money flowing in to buy ICOs less the money flowing out from the swindlers running successful ICOs.  But when the supply of suckers runs out the value of ethereum goes down.  We haven’t even begun to see that yet.  (The only relief here would be some huge successful decentralized for on-ethereum app that drew masses in AND spawned other successful decentralized apps. One app alone will not do this because its token can be bought on an exchange without ever needing ETH.  ETH is good for only ICOs and only a perpetual non-popping of the ICO bubble can keep the value of ETH high. Think about that.)
Ripple is a pure fools’ play.  It’s the cryptocurrency equivalent of every failed dotcom company that supplied Classified advertising websites to newspapers.  And the XRP token is the equivalent of the shares in those companies, all of which went to zero.  In the same way that craigslist and its ilk destroyed newspaper classifieds and suppliers of classified websites went down with that industry, ripple is trying to ride a wave of obsolete players’ irrelevant transactions. It does not have decentralization or mining and misses therefore the key foundational pillars of actual cryptocurrency - Just like newspaper classified websites that charged for listings and charged more for photos and sometimes insisting you buy a print ad missed the value of online classifieds.

They cannot see the witness address linked to a legacy address, because the private key is required to generate the witness address.  The witness address is an altogether different address and even though it has the same private key you must move coins from the legacy address to the witness address to spend them using a segwit format transaction.  I would not recommend sending from a legacy address to its corresponding segwit address.  It's no more effort to just create a new segwit address with a brand new private key and you don't risk the danger of having two addresses holding coins using the same private key, and forgetting that they are the same.

Hard to predict. I can foresee circumstances where they back off before the fork and ones where they go for a few months.  Without proper replay protection it will take longer to settle out because people will hold coins and not be able to them on or off exchanges. With proper replay protection B2X will last only about four to eight weeks. That does feel like eternity in bitcoin time, but it will still in that case be over by Christmas or New Years.

The actual cost of those coins is not $17 million, but instead what they could have been worth if the miner had mined bitcoin instead less what they are worth.  Chances are most of these have been mined while it was more profitable to mine BCH than BTC and therefore there’s very little cost to these coins if they are sold at some point. It’s very hard to second guess the motive of this miner.  But it is true that there is a huge bet riding on the volatility of BCH. This miner can short BCH and then sell this into the market without losing a nickel because they break even. The layers of possible game theory just make it impossible to know what the actual plan is.

While it's exciting to have you as one person with a large amount of bitcoin in many channels, I do think it's an important test for you to share your results in closing at least a few channels.  Being able to take your money back out of a channel, either to re-establish a newer channel or to move funds into cold storage is something many of us want to know is safe before we ourselves commit serious funds to LN at its current stage.
Just like bitcoin itself, which started out with only Satoshi mining, and with him getting all the first coins and being able to choose which transactions would and wouldn't get mined, but which eventually became so decentralized that he himself couldn't even mine a block, it appears that bootstrapping the Lightning Network will also require pioneers dedicating their time, money and resources to it until it can become widely decentralized to the point where it is highly reliable and no one entity can do it any significant harm. 
Your experiment here, along with you sharing these results, encourages further testing and use by those who can and should do that testing (and it perhaps also discourages those who shouldn't be experimenting with it now). Thanks again, then.

Although it's not exactly clear what you mean, my response though is, "So what?"  
1. implementing one element in a system is not the same as implementing a whole system. (Note how ripple uses digital signatures, but in no way qualifies as being a decentralized cryptocurrency, and maybe also note how a huge number of people don't understand this.)
2. The trick with moving forward isn't to throw away 100% of the value on a blockchain and start over every time someone has a good new idea, but to incorporate it into a system that people are already using.  The new coin-du-jour approach obviously eliminates any notion of sustainable store of value, practically by definition, since it states "We'll start with a  whole new blockchain when we have a new idea".  Instead, improving a consensus system with new functionality is where the real hard work lies for both technical and social reasons.  If you want to believe that you can just code up another blockchain and that the world will abandon bitcoin or ethereum, I think you'll discover that this won't be the case in the long term, simply because the people who jump ship to your new blockchain, whether its NEO, EOS, Cardano or something else, will also jump ship when the next new blockchain comes around.  The net result is a massive fragmentation of blockchains, none with a critical mass of users, none with large developer bases, none with any reason for anyone to remain loyal to them.  When people start to grow impatient with the lack of utility on these coins it will only be market manipulation (because in addition to these problems, most of these coins are extremely tightly held and massively pre-mined) that allows for even a facade of value being retained in them.

Very few people are providing an accurate analysis of this article, so let me.  In no particular order:
Number 1:


Garzik's only motive for working on S2X was to create infighting, not to see it released.  He secretly, duplicitously, stuck a knife in the back of the very project he was leading.
Number 2:
SegWit2X has no committed supporters any more - exchanges are all saying they will either list it as an altcoin or not list it at all; miners are starting to say they will mine both chains; Garzik has revealed he's working on something else.
Number 3:
The idea behind his altcoin is stupid.  It makes no sense and comes from the mind of someone who thinks he can create value in a stupid project by trying to cause havoc with another project.
Number 4:
Anybody who ever trusts Garzik in the future is a fool and deserves what they get, because this man is as untrustworthy as all the other (always unsuccessful) attackers of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:07:12
Yes. As long as you don't reuse addresses, bitcoin is quantum resistant.  Addresses are hashes of public keys, which (theoretical) quantum computers cannot resolve.  If every spend of a bitcoin spends all the coins in the address and moves them to a different address (the current default behaviour) then the public key of any address remains a secret and bitcoin remains resistant to quantum computers.
@_date: 2017-10-08 10:25:30
It's been 7.5 weeks since SegWit activated and we're already well over 9% of transactions.  When all services activate SegWit it will likely quickly go to the high 80s.  We will have had our block size increase without a hard fork and with support for layer 2 solutions.   Transaction fees and median confirmation times are way down.  Everything is functioning perfectly well thanks to this soft fork.

It’s ok.  You have your private keys.  Hold your coins if there is a fork and stay tuned for instructions on how to split them.  If you spend them after the fork without splitting them then they could be replayed on the other chain and you’ll have spent both.

Honestly dude, I get your position on this.  You're totally free to do whatever you think is best in the best way you think you can get it done.  I'm not persuaded for myself by your positions here today, but you haven't really made any case for what it is you tried to do, why, and what you're working on now.  This discussion has been about the difficulty and security of implementing LN on bitcoin and ethereum.  We really are drifting off the topic with each subsequent reply.  
I do want to address your second point though.  I think that the vast majority of the community wants bitcoin to succeed as a currency and become valuable as such.  They support the efforts of the developers and fought hard to make sure segwit got activated in a manner that did not compromise bitcoin's decentralization.  They are very security minded which is why you and I have had this conversation, where I took a security-first position.  Overall, the community is actually excellent, long term focussed (which is why the hodl) and really committed to bitcoin's principles.  Of course there's lots of toxic trolls who love to pretend to be victims of censorship and vitriol when they are called out but that's also part of living in a free world.  Nobody is stopping anybody from writing and launching a new coin.

Segwit puts the signature in a different part of the chain, it does not remove it from the transaction or the chain. No segwit transaction can happen without a valid signature, but segwit transactions have their transaction id or transaction hash determined independent of the signature. Because only signatures are malleable, segwit transaction ids can be predetermined even before being broadcast to the blockchain and this allows for trustless setup of things like channels. The transaction however will never be valid unless a valid signature is broadcast with it when it is broadcast. A fully validating node will have all the transactions and all the signatures for all transactions including segwit ones.  There can however be a new kind of node that validates segwit transactions using their signatures and once they are validated, prunes the signature, keeping only the transaction data.  A signature is proof of spend and once the proof has been provided it does not have to be kept forever by everyone.  I think this is the only shred of truth in roger’s misrepresentation. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:19:06
There you go using the word “trivial” again.   Probably you’re referring to only one element of what segwit does and in a blockchain that has no load, no history or no value.  I can create a version of Facebook with a trivial effort but it won’t be Facebook or be able to handle its load. 
I’m a bit of an old man in the internet and I remember a guy once coming in and telling me he had a version of Amazon he had built back when amazon was a couple of years old.  Yes, he had a basic ecommence site and a bunch of books in a closet somewhere, but it was not the same thing at all of course. Don’t underestimate the effort it takes to build something that works at scale in production just because you can build a prototype of it.

You are 100000% wrong. I don’t need them to be honest at all.  Any one of them that is dishonest has his work thrown in the garbage and discarded by my full node and the thousands of other full nodes that validate and relay 100% of the blocks. 
If we had to rely on them being honest then bitcoin wouldn’t work at all.
The short scribbles the miners put into block headers are meaningless. If they wrote in there Richard Nixon was Satoshi Nakamoto it wouldn’t make it so and it wouldn’t make the block they mined invalid.
@_date: 2018-07-11 14:00:06
Think it through:
Mining is increasing - both hardware and electricity, while the price is falling.  This implies mining is still expected to be profitable at these price levels by those participating in it.  
It may be that it is hard to stop mining for some of the larger operations because they have overhead fixed costs like rent and salaries that they need to pay, and that the electricity costs alone (those being the only variable costs of mining) are less than the price of a bitcoin, so it is still worthwhile to keep mining than to stop, even if the whole operation is now showing a loss when the cost of hardware and other overhead is fully allocated.  
However, the fact that we are still seeing hash rate being added certainly suggests an expected profit from those buying new hardware.  
This level of confidence is very telling about the worldwide expectation of value of bitcoin.  We are less than two years away from the next halving of the block reward.  Now one can mine blocks with rewards of 12.5 BTC against a global hash rate of 35 ExaHashes per second.  In two years time, the reward will be 6.5 BTC against a hash rate of at least 100 EH/s and possibly as much as 1000 EH/s or even more.  (In the past year hash rate has gone from 5 EH/s to 35 EH/s - so is that an increase of 30 EH/s per year or a multiplier of 7 times that we can expect?)  Either way, even the conservative number means that it will be 6 times as hard to mine a bitcoin in two years as it is now.  Either the price rises sixfold to adjust for that, or we see effort come down a lot.  
This halving of bitcoin's block reward and the increased competition to mine it is one of the biggest factors in making it such a powerful long term store of value.  There is a marathon race to mine bitcoins and to hold on to them to the point where mining them becomes harder.  This is not true of coins with premines and unchanging block rewards.  With pre-mined coins the race was to get in on the pre-mine.  With coins whose reward is steady, there is only competition against hash rate increases, and because of no specialized hardware, the miners switch hash rate from coin to coin if higher profitability exists elsewhere, so hash rate is not dedicated to those coins and can easily leave.  Ethereum, for example, is at only 4.2 times the year ago hash rate, and they implemented a hard for to reduce the block reward by 40&amp; last year specifically to drive more scarcity and create a race.  And if you look at the other GPU mined coins their variability is even wilder in hash rate ([ is a good site to see this on, and you can toggle to other coins there).  
So what does this actually say - bitcoin's miners are committed to bitcoin by specialized hardware and they believe in its long term value as a global currency that will be priced above its mining costs, and those costs are expected to increase dramatically in the long term due to the halvings.

This is witty, but a 51% attack on a chain and the creation of a totally different chain with different rules and more hashpower are two different things.  S2X is not bitcoin.  It’s a hardfork of bitcoin, incompatible with bitcoin’s consensus rules.  It could have 1 million times the hashpower of bitcoin and still not be bitcoin. It is a different chain with different rules.  Anyone calling it bitcoin is switching one chain for another and trying to pass that chain off the real bitcoin.  Only bitcoin is bitcoin.

The difficulty on BCH was 13% of BTC when the price was $700.  So it was way more profitable to kind BCH.  When B2X breaks off it will have the same difficulty. Expect what you will.  I expect miners want to stay in business.

I just read it and it is a very well reasoned dissent that suggests the SEC is over-reaching its mandate and authority in preventing this product from being released.  
My own take is that all these rulings do is delay the traditional financial players from getting involved in bitcoin, to the detriment of nobody but the traditional players.  These delays are good for coinbase, Binance, bitfinex etc, as it gives them more time and more profit in a market that is artificially keeping out traditional banks.  
Innovation in this space ends up routing around the traditional finance industry.  It will be harder and harder for those players to succeed in the crypto space the longer they are effectively kept out of it by rulings like this one.

If you want to access funds you have in an encrypted wallet.dat file:
1) First, of course, you must have the password to decrypt it.
2) You don't need to sync the whole blockchain.  You can import your private keys into an SPV wallet, like electrum.  Use the "dumpprivkey" command in the bitcoin-qt console.  (Found under "Help"--&gt;"Debug Window"--&gt;"Console".  Then in electrum choose "Wallet"--&gt;"Private Keys"--&gt;"Sweep" and then paste in the keys you copied from bitcoin-qt.
It should not take weeks to sync the whole chain, but maybe you have a slow connection to the internet or a very old computer or a very old version of bitcoin-qt.  Anyhow, best of luck with whatever you're trying to do.

UASF is not about node count.  Bitcoin works on consensus not majority.  UASF has a very distinct chance of creating a chain fork if some miners run it and others don't.  If more than 50% of hashpower supports it, then the non-UASF chain is likely to get reorganized away.   But otherwise, we end up with two chains - one that will activate segwit and one that will not.  
You as a user have the choice to run either or both chains.  
It won't be pretty. I'm not saying it will be.  What else isn't pretty is the status quo which is holding back Bitcoin and does not have any resolution visible on the horizon.

Now to your scenario, it is an "all in" strategy for Jihan and Roger to actually sell their UASF coins and spend money to buy Jihan-coin.

Good questions.
I do not think this is an empty threat.  We need consensus for bitcoin to run properly, but we need it among three groups of stakeholders: developers, miners and **users**.  An activation date based soft fork is the signalling mechanism for users and is also one for miners.  Developers have signalled by releasing segwit.  
However, and most importantly, it is the advocacy now and up until the deadline that constitutes the meaningful progress towards the activation or not.  There are still over 70 days until activation.  The mempool today exceeded 200,000 transactions.  There is urgency to address this backlog.  Things can happen in this space in a matter of hours, so 2.5 months is a very long time.  
Now, releasing a 51% miner support version of segwit probably does not achieve the same goal.  It again gives zero choice to users and zero mechanism to users to participate in the choice of activating or not activating segwit.   It simply pits one caste of miners against another while leaving users silent on the sidelines.  I can go into more detail about the practical distinction here if this explanation seems to superficial.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:02:10
Why don't you just sign a message from the public address associated with the key.  If it verifies, you know you have a private key that corresponds to a public key that hashes to your address.  Or if you don't understand what I just said, it means your private key corresponds to that address.

You'll have to declare and pay taxes if you live in the west so talk to an accountant first (theoretically). 
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:46:34
UASF alone does not protect against slow block discovery and empty block attacks.
Proof of work was created as a solution to individuals being able to use Sybil attacks on decentralization.  Unfortunately, we are in a position now where one party has become able to represent 45%-60% and growing of the block discovery.  And one effect of POW is that if that one party drops out now, blocks will take twice as long to discover for a period of four weeks.  So a UASF that doesn't win the support of the existing miners actually directly leads to slow block discover and network congestion.

Those 1.8 million BTC that were mined back before the first halving are almost surely all lost.  It's been 6-10 years that they've sat still.
It's very hard to believe that any of those people who mined these would have just sat on these coins without selling or moving them for that long.  
They probably did some mining, figured this bitcoin thing would go away and then lost the information needed to spend the coins.  
@_date: 2016-05-19 16:08:46
What's most likely true is that most of the actual stolen bitcoins were stolen, and then likely cashed out in some way when those coins were worth $1 or less a piece.  So the heist perpetrators are not living off of hundreds of millions of dollars someplace.  They're probably people who made maybe a $100,000 off of it.

About the only bad scenario I can foresee is that two chains go on without a clear winner - this will occur if the non segwit chain takes a lead in length of a few blocks and the UASF chain never catches up so both chains are actively being mined and both continue to exist.  You end up with two versions of the blockchain and a big battle to argue over which is actually Bitcoin.   The best way to mitigate this is a combination of all of the following: More users upgrading to the UASF client and rejecting the second chain (or, vice versa, an economic majority ignoring the UASF chain); more miners diverting power from the original chain (or vice versa if the community wants to see the SegWit chain abandoned); a clear emergence of low value behind the coins on one of the chains in relation to the other.   
This is why those of us advocating for a UASF are asking everyone who can to signal as soon as possible.  This battle can be resolved without a shot being fired if it is clear before the activation date that the UASF chain has the majority of users and has miners on board.  It will be a nail biter for sure leading up to the date - welcome to bitcoin.  But the more that people signal, the clearer it will be that there is no point in holding back SegWit with shenanigans.  And when it's clear that the soft fork is going to be activated, there will be no need to fear a worst case scenario.  There will be one chain, with consensus, with increased transaction capacity and with the capability of Layer 2 scaling activated.

I think the confidence that the release is actually out does make a difference in probability calculations.

I had a statistics university professor who used to say "The greatest productivity tool ever created by man is a deadline."   Creating a deadline causes people to act towards some resolution on that deadline.  A strong advocacy and credible effort behind UASF will be the stimulant that all discussions need.  Its near term deadline will get people seriously negotiating in the near term.  
I do not want two chains and one of them being called an alt coin.  I want a resolution that the community comes to.  The advocacy of UASF along with the credible possibility of it being activated could lead to miners succumbing to signalling SegWit or some other resolution.  It may amount to nothing.  It is at least a move towards a resolution and the status quo otherwise is two parties sitting on their hands, each claiming to be right and unwilling to negotiate or coordinate as you would like them to.

UASF is the User Activated Soft Fork which requires that as of August 1st, blocks must signal in favour of SegWit activation to be considered valid.  All blocks that do not signal for SegWit activation will be rejected by nodes running the UASF.  
The intent of this BIP is to end the impasse over SegWit activation through an activation mechanism that relies on the users and some miners instead of the current activation mechanism which relies on none of the users and 95% of the miners.
At present the mining community is divided between signalling for unlimited and segwit and the two are caught in a standoff.  Meanwhile the blockchain is full and transaction costs are skyrocketing, which is also leading to many users considering alternate coins.  
UASF aims to draw a line in the sand at August 1st.  Miners who do not signal for SegWit will be on their own chain after that and risk losing their mining reward value to reorganization of the blockchain and a generally lower value on coins on a chain that rejects SegWit.
I did a [big Q&amp;A thread this weekend](   on the subject.
Also did a short thread on [why the UASF chain will be more valuable]( if there is a split.  
Happy reading and thanks for your interest and curiosity.  I hope after you inform yourself you join the UASF movement.

Much has been written about this.  Very briefly, turing complete smart contracts written in high level languages are large programs open to bugs and unforeseen complexities, especially when those programs run in an environment where they are interacting with other programs.  Last year, the DAO debacle lead to tens of millions of dollars being stolen from the DAO and a hard fork was rushed to change the behaviour of the contract essentially nullifying it.  
On centralized platforms, especially on the Internet, if your code is discovered to have a bug in it, you just fix it and the program starts to run fine, but you cannot edit code on a smart contract because the whole point of it is that it is not malleable so people can trust that it will run exactly as it was coded.  
Last year a formal verification study was conduct by Harvard and Microsoft and concluded that only a handful of then published ethereum contracts were not vulnerable to attacks.  The paper since seems to have been taken down or moved elsewhere but the discussion on reddit remains here:

What's not worth a damn is a Bitcoin client that only runs if it is connected to trusted peers, since we are running a trustless network.

That's what we UASFers have done. Our nodes are gonna activate so miners better adapt.  There's no risk really.  It's not like we've kept it a secret what we're doing. We've taken the steering wheel and thrown it out of the car.  Come august first we either crash, taking out the miners who gave shareholders and millions at stake, or they activate SegWit.

This is bullish I agree, but more so because it is a transfer of large stakes of bitcoin from willing sellers to new long term holders.

There's no precise number. What we need for final victory is 51% of mining support.  
But the stage we are at now is users voting through signalling.  If this continues then we can get miners to signal and exchanges to acknowledge they'll be allowing buying and selling of a second chain if one emerges. 
When the soft fork activates if mining support is split we will have a temporary chain split.  If users then sell their non segwit coins and put the value into the segwit ones more miners will redirect their hashpower to the UASF chain, and when 51% do the old chain will disappear as soon as the length of the UASF chain is greater by only one block.

I think it is guaranteed that if a proof of work change makes it as far as a downloadable binary and gets into a testnet that all miners will fall to their knees and signal segwit immediately, especially if that POW was ASIC and GPU resistant and easy to turn on in the client.   
But getting that far is hard work and time consuming, and risks being throw away if the community acts sheepish when the time comes that the miners signal in favour of segwit.

I will try to get the exact mechanics in the coming days, but the general gist of replay protection comes from splitting your coins on the two chains by creating transactions that depend on the different coinbase transactions of the two separate chains.
A soft-fork, being entirely backwards compatible, is by definition indistinguishable from the prior chain and cannot have built right into it any replay protection that I am aware of.  That's not true of a hard fork, so it is not an apples to apples comparison.

Sure.  I've been following the space and evaluating various cryptocurrency projects for about four years.  The development contributors for Bitcoin and their commits on github are publicly available information.

2. Requires a hard fork which is not backwards compatible and therefore requires every single wallet to replace its software, which is impossible to do effectively by September (especially since rollout can't begin until software is written, tested and debugged, and it's not written yet).
3. Lots of other concerns that have been aired which may or may not turn out to be serious when tested.

Somebody should. On the UASF side we were proposing ways to try to activate SegWit via bit 4 as called for and u/Luke-jr even wrote a 2 mb hard fork in response to it.  But nothing has been said or done in response. All the more reason we keep thinking it's just a delay tactic to draw attention away from UASF and reinforce the stalemate of high fees and backlogged transactions.  
Calling us fanatics when we're doing everything reasonable to see success really throws us off in believing that there's good faith on the other side.

Best sentence from this article: 


@_date: 2017-05-16 15:45:54
Changing the config file doesn't actually activate UASF.  It just signals that you support it.
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:36:28
I'll try, but none of this is simple.
First, transactions have become slower and more expensive because there's only so much room in every block (enough for about 2000 transactions) and those blocks happen only every 10 minutes on average.  So people are paying more to have their transactions prioritized, but it's becoming a bidding war.
Second, there are a variety of plans to grow the number of transactions possible.  The one developed by the core bitcoin developers is called Segregated Witness, and the technology behind it is way too complicated to explain to a newbie, but the benefits are easy to explain.  It will allow a doubling of the transactions that can be put on the blockchain and allow the creation of high speed, high volume, low transaction fee solutions, like the Lightning Network you've heard of.  This code has been tested and was released six months ago, but it has not been activated on the network because the activation method's criteria has not yet been met. That criteria is that 95% of all the miners' blocks in a two week period must signal that they support Segregated Witness.
Now, only about 35% of miners are signalling in favour.  There are lots of theories as to why they are not, but this enters the realm of speculation and things are confusing enough for you as a newbie.
A second proposal to grow the number of transactions possible is to just make blocks bigger.  But as you already seem to be aware of, this requires changing the code in a way that every single user must upgrade.  Also, this has not been tested or developed by the core developers.  Also, the one solution that is in production attempting to do this, Bitcoin Unlimited, has had four complete network failures in the last several weeks, indicating it is in no way near ready for running in production as a substitute to bitcoin core and the other established clients.
Lots of solutions being proposed and debated to break this impasse.  Lots of parties with conflicted interest.  Lots of mud slinging.  Until the problem is resolved fees will remain higher than in the past and transaction times will remain longer than in the past.

But that is the tradeoff to being involved in a trustless currency.  There's an old saying that says "freedom isn't free" and it generalizes to "that which is worth something is worth working for".  Buying bitcoins and having someone else hold custody of them isn't buying bitcoins.  It's giving someone cash to hold on to bitcoins for you.  There's a **BIG** difference between the two which you really appreciate when everyone else is desperately trying to withdraw their coins from an insolvent supplier and you aren't.

It's far from over for the altcoins.  They need to be showing down 50%-90% to get in line with their actual value relative to bitcoin when measured in users, transactions, security and awareness.  
The scare tactics about bitcoin drove publicity of crypto up but fear of bitcoin up too, so those alts got pumped way past the moon.  
For example, at $77US per ether, the mining reward every 10 minutes is $15,454 (4 blocks per minute times five ether per block times 10 minutes).  Meanwhile the bitcoin mining reward every 10 minutes is only $16,875 at $1350 per coin (12.5 times $1350).  
Yet the bitcoin hashrate is 4.5 million terahashes, while the ethereum one is 21 terahashes.  That's right, bitcoin security is 400,000 times that of ethereum.

Your cold storage is perfectly safe no matter what outcome.  
Your private key remains unchanged and if one chain wins you'll be able in the future to spend on whichever that chain is. If there is a chain split and somehow both chains survive for the long term, there will be services in the future that will allow you to split your coins on the two chains (i.e. send a transaction that's valid on one chain and not on the other) and then you'll end up holding coins on both chains at different addresses. Sit tight and watch from the sidelines if you wish knowing that your coins are safe.

Just to first correct your comment, UASF nodes are not blocking non-segwit transactions.  What they are blocking are blocks that do not signal in favour of segwit activation.  It is in effect serving notice to miners that the time to prepare for SegWit signalling has run out.  Miners are not forced to mine SegWit, but they are required to use the same chain and validation rules as all the users' nodes.  
I know this is a complicated point that is hard to understand, but this is a soft fork, and all soft forks do have the risk of a chain split if some miners do and some do not enforce the soft fork.  A hard fork is a chain split by definition with zero possibility of a pre-fork node accepting any post-fork blocks as valid.  For example, if segwit activates every single bitcoin client will accept any block with segwit even if that node was compiled before segwit was ever even conceived.  It's backwards compatible.  That's what makes the fork soft.  The node that doesn't understand segwit would potentially allow a spend of that transaction that was not compatible with segwit, but it would never see such a spend because mining consensus wouldn't produce one.  On the other hand, if a single 1.1 Mb block was mined every single bitcoin node would reject that whole block outright and the only way to get them to accept it is to get everyone to stop running old clients, download and install new ones and import their keys if necessary.
The confusing aspect of compatibility is an issue that makes it hard to understand the difference between the two kinds of forks, but the UASF is absolutely 100% a soft fork and 0% a hard fork.  That doesn't mean there isn't a risk of a chain split.  That can happen with any soft fork that does not have majority mining support.

@_date: 2017-05-17 20:31:43
I'm pretty sure you're mistaken on the following point; I would ultimately need to upgrade to a compatible client to send and receive transactions on the extension block.  
With segwit old clients will see segwit transactions.  However, they won't be able to create segwit transactions.  And they'll see these transactions as "anyone can spend" but the miners running the soft fork will not actually allow anyone to spend those transactions. 
Most of the network is now running a
Bitcoin client which allows them to create segwit transactions.  If they weren't then enabling the soft fork would be generally meaningless. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:39:11
The miner attack of a UASF chain is very very hard.  The best estimate of the theory is that they will secretly dedicate mining power to the UASF chain, mining empty blocks and release those only if there is another mined block to try to orphan it.  This requires that they dedicate hash power not to building new blocks on either chain - not on the chain they want to survive (thereby slowing block discovery there) and not on the chain they want to kill.  Their biggest danger though is the UASF chain getting one block longer than theirs, so unless they have a very strong majority of the hash power, they risk losing everything by trying this strategy.
Your question about ASICBoost is interesting.  ASICBoost is only an advantage if some miners are using it and other aren't.  But all miners say they aren't using it.  Those miners that aren't using it stand to gain back an even playing field if other miners are prevented from using it.  So their economic incentive is to mine on the UASF chain.  If this chain levels the playing field and is the one that cannot be destroyed by reorganization and is the one whose coins are likely to be worth the most, which chain do you think the majority of non-Antpool miners will use?  And Antpool's only reason by this scenario is that they are in fact secretly using covert ASICBoost while lying about it.
Finally, you ask about the compromise.  There isn't strong evidence that it was in the cards.  I for one saw no developer say they wanted to move towards the compromise and I didn't hear any miner say anything new about it either.  Jihan has said things in the past, but we don't have any reason to think he is going to follow through.  The big push now for UASF is to get to some resolution.  Every supporter of UASF would be thrilled if it lead to a situation where we had a MASF (miner activated soft fork) occur before the UASF activation date, making UASF entirely unnecessary.  However, it is only the realistic possibility of a UASF that will bring about a resolution.  Talking is only getting the two sides further apart and the endless misrepresentations (either through mistakes or downright malicious distortion) is only confusing people further.

You're confused about two things.  
First hashpower doesn't have to be high because of bitcoin's design. The difficulty adjusts as more hashpower is added.  The ten minute time to find a block is by design.  
Second, miners mine transactions that have been broadcast, they don't mind addresses with unspent inputs, so they couldn't know which addresses were going to need to be mined in advance of the transactions occurring. 
Lastly the block size limit is designed to prevent the blockchain from growing too quickly.  Doing away with limits allows for all kinds of spam attacks.

I am not sure what you want me to elaborate on.  The UASF chain will prevent Asicboost, thereby levelling the mining playing field and making mining equally profitable for all players leading to further decentralization of mining. The UASF chain cannot be reorganized by a longer non-Segwit chain, but the non-UASF chain can disappear if the UASF chain is longer. So there is more existential certainty to that chain.  The UASF coins will be on a chain with more transaction capacity and which supports layer 2 solutions which the non-UASF chain does not.  The UASF chain is superior in every respect.

Where's the best place to read up on the proposals for PoW change right now?  
It seems to me that what would draw the economic users in would be a new PoW that they could reasonably participate in.  Something akin to the environment that must have existed before FPGUs became necessary and way before ASICs came to the fore.  
Bundling that type of PoW change in with SegWit wouldn't mean that users abandon the original chain, but it might mean that the new PoW chain draws the core developers and the economic majority in, leaving the miners stranded, helpless and powerless.  
This PoW centralization problem is not going to go away even if we do get SegWit.  If we can kill two birds with one stone here, it is certainly worth exploring.

10 years is a long time.  I'd put a variance on any estimate that distance out of at least one order of magnitude between the high and low.  I think 1 bitcoin should be worth between $30,000 and $300,000 in ten years.  
There is of course the possibility that something better comes out or that some vulnerability destroys bitcoin.  But for now, it's got the network effect, the awareness, proven security, proven uptime, the best developers, and the clearest focus on being a digital store and transfer of value.  Notice how every coin tries to define itself in reference to bitcoin -- e.g. it's a blockchain but with Turing complete script, or it's bitcoin with proof of stake, or it's bitcoin with confidential transactions.  They all hold bitcoin as the standard.   This may change, but it sure hasn't yet.

I suppose different ones of us who were endorsing UASF had different expectations, but mine was always to create a deadline to make something happen to activate SegWit.  It looks like UASF will succeed on that measure.  The UASF effort is to show that we are more than sheep and that even if the only tool at our disposal is a hamfisted but legitimate threat to cause ruckus we will wield that to get behaviour that advances the cause.  We are rational people turned to radical action to pursue rational goals.  Recall that only a couple of weeks ago, Jihan was against SegWit and had claimed to have only just then read up on it.  The deadline caused by UASF scared him into acting and created the impetus for what we're seeing now.  It's no coincidence the NY agreement is activating SegWit prior to August 1st.

@_date: 2017-05-07 19:18:19
Option 1: If you don't need the money right away then I'd just advise you be patient.  The first transaction you published is growing in priority as it ages, and it grows with each block.  It's going to get mined and you have the exact same fee on the second one.  
Option 2: Are you using bitcoin core?  (If not what wallet are you using).  You can call up the "debug window" from the "help" menu, click on "console" and type in abandontransaction "f2bfb729e8ed80e0b5023325c2c277b31eb9694ffc03f6d94d34e8ba355e816e" 
That will broadcast to miners that you want to abandon the transaction and it will also get them to abandon the dependent transaction as it will become invalid.
(edit: Sorry, the transaction is already in the mempool so it cannot be abandoned).
Correct Option 2: go to the console and type in bumpfee "f2bfb729e8ed80e0b5023325c2c277b31eb9694ffc03f6d94d34e8ba355e816e"
that will increase the fee and make the transaction more likely to get mined much sooner.
(edit: Sorry, lol, but you can only bump the fee on 3baf6936a519b77c7bf4ae83905ada1eadacd0ff3c33eb0ef05ee7cbbf54ef77 because bumpfee does not work on transactions that already have descendents in the mempool.

2. Because this would be a complete capitulation and would unnecessarily create two chains with identical functionality.  Letting the UASF chain get longer is the only path to there being one chain if there is a split.

You're wrong, Jihan. Users are not meant to serve miners. I've seen these users do great things, and year after year they somehow manage to pick food for themselves *and* you. So-so who is the weaker species? Users don't serve miners!  It's *you* who need *us*! We're a lot stronger than you say we are... And you know it, don't you?

1. I don't know enough about it.
2. What's your ISP and data plan?  If people use Netflix with your ISP then a bitcoin node, transferring only 1 Mb every 10 minutes in negligibly small.
3. You can shut the node down or disconnect from the network when you want.  The bandwidth is only an average of about 1Kb per second though, so very light.
4. There is no known case of a bitcoin core node being attacked in the way you discussed in the entire 9 year history of bitcoin core running.  You're in much more danger from countless known CIA and NSA exploits that have nothing to do with whether or not you run bitcoin.

By the time the last bitcoin is mined in 100 years, the dollar will have lost another 99% of its value (as it has over last 100 years), so you can assume gold and bitcoin would be worth 100 times as much in dollars.  That's $34 million per bitcoin or $347,000 in today's dollars.  
Frankly I think it will be worth a lot more by then, but I'll be dead.

Thanks for the clarification.  Is there a quick reference I can look to to see how the transactions and blocks actually do differ?
As to you question about urgency, in thirty years, when I'm seventy-seven years old, I'd like to say this to my grandson from my private island:
"Thirty years ago, when your dad was only seventeen years old, the world was in a state of crisis.  People didn't have access to what we call money today.  Most of them used numbers in computers owned by organizations called banks.  And those banks just put in the numbers largely based on whatever the governments told them to.  
Some people, a very small number of them, thought that money was gold, but they were clinging to traditions from before the time computers were even invented.  
Then, the underpinnings of what we call money today was invented and we called it bitcoin then.  But hardly anybody understood it because they were all using the government money.  
And in its early days, this underpinning, or bitcoin, had a lot of obstacles.  Ignorance was a big one, but so was fear, and so was tradition.  
But among the people that were adopting bitcoin there was a big battle.  Bitcoin wasn't perfect and people fought over how to improve it.  Even when only about a million people out of the billions of people in the world were using it for only one percent of their transacting, it was reaching its limit in terms of how many people could use it in a given time.  We called that issue blockchain congestion.  
And we needed blockmakers, which we called miners then, to allow a change that would allow everyone in the world to use money.  We thought it might be the end for bitcoin when the change was made available but the blockmakers wouldn't allow its use.  
But your grandpa, that's me, and a few other brave people broke the impasse by making it so that those blockmakers who supported the kind of foundation that we now use for money could break free from the impasse.  
That was the last change that ever got made on the underpinning layer we called bitcoin, which we now call moneyblocks.  And it allowed something we called Lightning Network, which is the early version of what you today call money.  
And because of that brave move, real money was able to be used by everyone, and that underpinning layer, the moneyblocks, became so valuable that I was able to buy this whole island and make it private and free from government coercion and fraudulent money for ten mega moneyblockcoins, which we called one bitcoin back then, when this island used to be called Jamaica."

They are not all for sale at today's prices.  If you (or the richest man in the world) buy 1 million of them you'll find you have to pay over $40000 to $50000 each because people like me are holding theirs until the value is even greater.  I think I'm going to hold my bitcoins until they are worth enough each to buy a decent house.  There's a lot more than 21 million houses in the world...

The evidence that he provided was that he demonstrated what appeared to be signing a message with Satoshi's private key, in controlled conditions in front of several reporters and known members of the bitcoin community.  It turns out that he almost certainly used some kind of trickery to fool those people into believing that what they witnessed was a message being signed with those keys, but was in fact a "magic" trick of some sort.  
I would analogize this claim to someone claiming that he is a true magician and able to saw a woman in half and put her back together.  He calls several reporters and doctors into a room and holds some demonstration that convinces them that he can do this.  Then afterwards, in public, he is unwilling and unable to repeat his demonstration.

No.  
As soon as you spend from an address, the public key for it is revealed.  So the idea is (only in the event of the existence of something that breaks ECDSA) it's okay to create public keys and have coins sent to their hashes (because the public key is never revealed).  Then, whenever you use the address, spend everything from it (which is what happens now) and never reuse it.

Your situation is best understood by you and my comment above may be out of context. 
I look at the world today and I see western democracies providing arms and aid to corrupt regimes and I think what a horrible mistake it is. Foreign aid always ends up in the hands of the dictators and not in the hands of the needy.  
BU has fooled a bunch of people using tactics that would be considered criminal fraud and libel if legal authorities paid attention to this space. And much of the libel has been directed at you. To then read in the OP that you have helped your enemies is what inspired my comment.  You're a hero to many of us, rightfully so.  
From your reply I gather you're not trying to help BU but rather to grow the knowledge out there. This may be your intention and you may be correct. But in adversarial situations there is also a context. The mathematicians who created cryptography knew that it was an adversarial system and knew that they had to keep secrets.  I do not know what the right moral choices are in every situation. I just urge you to consider some of these factors too if you are currently not taking them into account.

You're mistaken.  The "base" data, which is the transactions without the signatures (inputs and outputs) is what the old nodes add up to measure if it is less than one megabyte.  But SegWit does store all the witness data right there in the blockchain.  If you run a full node you will see the blockchain growing by 2MB a block after SegWit.  If you prune your blockchain, you will fit more transactions into the prune size than before.  Please watch the video I linked to in another comment.  It will correct you misunderstanding.

In fiat the concept of PoW security doesn't exist so your analogy makes no sense to me.  Also in fiat the concept of block rewards doesn't exist so your analogy fails doubly.  
In fact your analogy talks about money supply.  And where the supply is increases without a corresponding increase in value then the value per unit ultimately decreases.  
My point is that these alt valuations bear no semblance to any valuation method.  I'll grant that Ethereum is getting more users although I believe they are speculators rather than investors but that's a separate issue.  However, the valuation of so many of these other Alts which have few users, tools, potential, security, etc... is just an indication of the fact that they've been successfully pumped up.  Without the fundamental being there though, the price itself is unsustainable.  At some point there will be a mad scramble for the exits when nobody holding BTC of ETH will be willing to trade those for those paper tigers. Sure your Litecoin will hold some value then but anything below the top 10 will lose 80% to 99% of its value. The history is there with previous alt boom and busts.

Hey Sam, sure a Schnorr signature can be used to consolidate a bunch of inputs, but if someone's goal is to spam, they'll continue using ECDSA sigs.  What's to stop those from being sent, while maintaining backwards compatability?  Is it simply the expectation that miners won't mine spam like that?  I mean, what faction do you think was responsible for all that spam?
@_date: 2017-05-21 09:50:50
Every bitcoin node at the time of UASF activation, whether it is activating the UASF or not activating it, will be required to produce blocks at the prior difficulty average over the prior 2 weeks.  If, at the time of activation 50% of mining power switches to the UASF rules and 50% remains on the old rules, then block discovery on both chains would average 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes, and it would actually do this for four weeks instead of two.  This is because the difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, which works out to 2 weeks if the average discovery time is 10 minutes.  If only 33% of the mining power shifts to UASF it will take on average 30 minutes to discover UASF blocks and an average of 15 minutes to discover a non-UASF block (and vice versa if 67% of the mining power shifts to UASF).  
If there is no mining power activating UASF there is no UASF.  
In fact however, if miners who are against the UASF dedicate their mining power to some kind of attack on the UASF chain, they will be slowing block discovery on the old chain rules, costing them block rewards and further delaying the period of time until their difficulty readjusts to reflect their declined hash power and to reset it to 10 minutes.  By far, the strongest attack they can muster up is simply not to mine the UASF chain and dedicate all their power to the non-UASF rules.   
Note that as long as some hash power is being diverted to two separate chains, the block discovery on each chain will slow down proportionally to the amount diverted.  (The calculation is easy to do: the new block discovery time for a chain will be 10 minutes divided by the percentage of hash power mining on that chain.)  August 1st is expected to be  a difficulty reset date so roughly 2016 blocks will need to be mined on either chain before that chain will be restored to 10 minute block discovery times.  
If that's not complicated enough let me again remind the reader here, that at any point in time, if the UASF chain gets one block longer than the non-UASF chain, all the non-UASF blocks that were added since the fork (ALL OF THEM) are replaced by the UASF blocks - permanently and forever.  If there is a chance of the UASF chain getting longer then - say 45% hash power even (due to natural variance), then it is a big gamble for any miner to try to mine blocks that will disappear.  
And therein lies the ultimate goal of this whole UASF effort.  It is to get 51% or so of miners to agree to mine UASF as early as possible.  Once that much hash power is on the UASF chain, there is no choice for all miners other than to mine on that chain, because the other chain is going to disappear as soon as the UASF chain gets one block longer.
The ideal time to know this is of course before the activation date.  If 51% of miners announce UASF support, you can count on 100% mining support within hours of the activation.  If 20%-30% of miners support UASF, then it's a long drawn out battle providing one side does not give in.  
The whole crypto world will be watching this battle closely.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:06:53
A hardfork is contentious now however.  If you initiated a hard fork you are 100% certain to get two chains and the very worst case scenario.  One side doesn't want a hard fork, so it's not accurate to say that in a hard fork both sides get what they want.    It does not take a lot of contention to end up with two forks - take a look at Ethereum (and Ethereum Classic).  That hard fork leading to two chains occurred because two sides could not agree on the best way to implement justice against a malicious actor.  A non-contentious bitcoin hard fork is certainly something that isn't in the cards now.

I can't even find a time where there have been two orphaned blocks in a row in the last several years (but I may be wrong), so two confirmations looks to be extremely strong.  Even if you get one confirmation and check the sending address on a blockchain explorer to ensure they haven't broadcast a double spend you can be pretty sure you're dealing with someone who isn't able or interested in reversing the transaction.

After each chain's first difficulty adjustment they will each grow at one block per ten minutes on average. One won't be faster then than the other unless hash power shifts. It's gonna be a crazy time if we get a split. But I fully expect that the more we get signalling for UASF the more likely it is we will have no contention by flag day.

Now, there really isn't a big concern here for the following reasons:
1. Breaking SHA256 is a long way off still and indications it breaks will simply lead to a fork to change the usage of SHA256 in the future, along with a likely hard checkpoint at the point of the break so nobody can change the past.  
2. Both SHA256 and Elliptic Curve Public Key Cryptography need to be broken to steal bitcoin, so there's a huge degree of protection on saving store of value.

Agreed on the status quo.  Not as much on the BU support.  
@_date: 2017-05-21 02:46:23
The goal is to generate a large majority before activation date.  A hard fork has zero probability by definition of there being one chain after it.  It only has the hope that everyone abandons the other chain. A soft fork does not have to cause a chain split.  So that's your big safety factor differential right there.  
The proponents of UASF are not suggesting that it be activated if its support is low, only if it is high.  We are currently in the period of advocating and soliciting support.  If a majority is on board there will be no chain split with a UASF.  Any hard fork would result in a chain split.
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:42:35

Yes, the backwards compatibility of a soft fork does mean that splitting a coin is tricky.  I'm going to ask around and think of if there is a way to do it.  If you can make a transaction that relies on the existence of a particular block hash or coinbase transaction that is on one chain and not the other, it will happen on only one chain and you will have effectively split the coins originating at the input address.

Ethereum has been around for a couple of years and nobody has found a way to have its blockchain know the "truth".  And when the community thought the blockchain was wrong about what the "truth" should be they forked the chain to give themselves back the money they had lost on the DAO.

If every node has to be upgraded to a non-bitcoin core node to be on the new network and if no bitcoin core node runs on that network, it's a huuuuge stretch to call that network bitcoin.

I have no idea who you are talking about here.


Satoshi Nakamoto is the founder.  I've said nothing about him here.  He clearly felt mining was meant to be decentralized though, which it now is not, but that's besides the point of UASF.


It is clear why those people are acting against the interests of increased throughput and lower fees.  I'm not 'demonizing' them, I'm saying we should resist their continued disservice to us.

You've been fudded if you believe this.  If the miners roll back to not enforce SegWit their blocks will be rejected by en masses by all the nodes that have activated SegWit. The chain will fork.  Their mining rewards will be invalidated.  And moreover, none of the transactions sent or received by the non upgraded nodes will be segwit transactions so they won't even be reversible with a SegWit rollback. So the attack vector you describe is 100% wrong.

Bitcoin isn't the MySpace of cryptocurrency. It's more the Internet of it. There were competing networking solutions (Novell, Simba, telephone, etc) or applications of internet tech (intranets, private networks and virtual private networks).  Today anything that exists sits on top of the internet. 
We are in the early days now of cryptocurrency where people are trying to offer solutions that don't integrate with one another and unnecessarily conduct redundant exercises that destroy network effects.  For example, bitcoin's mining security is far greater than all the other alts combined (despite the fallacious and misleading claims of Ethereum that because their mining reward is worth more than bitcoin's at times that that makes it secure) yet instead of relying on that security all the alts have to invest heavily to create a lower level of security.  This is ignoring a powerful network effect and one factor that will lead to their demise. 
Many things lead to the death of MySpace, but the biggest one was that it totally sold out to corporate interests at the expense of users.  It was acquired by Fox which was its death blow.  Bitcoin is the only coin that actually is fighting off these corporate interests.  The others are whoring themselves out as fast as they can while Bitcoin remains decentralized and democratized.  Ethereum cheers that big banks and Microsoft are on board. Who the fuck wants a cryptocurrency whose most powerful players are banks and Microsoft?  That's like thinking that it would have been a good thing for MySpace to sell out Fox and endless advertisers, which is exactly the opposite of what turned out to be the case.

The price is calculated based on trades on exchanges.  Those trades are all off the blockchain.  When you're done trading and want your coins back, then the exchange sends them to you on the blockchain and then you'll have to wait for the transaction to confirm and pay the fees.

The lost bitcoins exist at an address whose private key will likely never be discovered. As such nobody will ever be able to spend them.  If you lose your private key it's like losing your bitcoins and you can never expect any technique will be invented to recover them.   So don't lose your private key.

They talk of building smart contracts to do things that could never work on smart contracts and which could easily work on a tiny server on AWS. Some can be educated but all are coming into crypto because they have been told it's a magic way to do "things" and that they'll get rich.

Your hodled coins are perfectly safe no matter what outcome.  
Your private key remains unchanged and if one chain wins you'll be able in the future to spend on whichever that chain is. If there is a chain split and somehow both chains survive for the long term, there will be services in the future that will allow you to split your coins on the two chains (i.e. send a transaction that's valid on one chain and not on the other) and then you'll end up holding coins on both chains at different addresses. Sit tight and watch from the sidelines if you wish knowing that your coins are safe.

The private key is a very large number that was used,invisibly to you, by your computer to generate a public key that was hashed by your computer to produce your address.  It is impossible to figure out by looking at your address or public key what your private key is, but it is possible to use your private key to sign a message that can be computationally verified by anybody to correspond to the public key which hashes to your address.  
A Bitcoin transaction is a message cryptographically signed with your private key that corresponds to saying "take the coins at this address whose public key hashes to the address and move them to these other addresses".  If the signature checks out and the address contains the quantity of coins you're trying to send and the sum of the outputs (spends) is less than or equal to the inputs,the transaction is valid. 
You can read more on public-private key cryptography which is the technology behind how transactions are created and what the ledger of balances is composed of in Bitcoin.

For months various groups with varying things they agree and disagree about have circled and jockeyed for position to advance what they think is important.  UASF succeeded in getting the big industry players to activate SegWit in the same manner as the UASF before its activation date.

@_date: 2017-05-28 11:48:37
Yes.  Multibit has a very easy way for you to export your private keys, so you can back them up.  If there is a chain split, do not transact after August 1st without first using a splitting tool.  No such tool has been published yet, because it needs for there to be actual blocks on the two separate chains, but many will at that time.

Whether your wallet is synced up or not has nothing to do with whether or not the transaction has been mined and is on the blockchain.  I can send bitcoins to addresses that are in cold storage and then only look at blockchain.info to see that the money is there without ever syncing those wallets. 
What you are describing is that you requested a payment but it was likely never broadcast. However, if it was and was somehow dropped from the mempool, it could simply be rebroadcast. But it may be that it was malformed which is why you're seeing the error message you're seeing (e.g. The funds were insufficient or there was a double spend or the transaction was not signed properly.)

This is called a "replay attack" because the attacker is just broadcasting, or replaying, the transaction from one chain on the other.  The money would have to be sent to the same address though.  This happened extensively when Ethereum hard forked into ethereum and Ethereum classic until coin splitters were created that resolved this, but it's still possible for coins that haven't moved since the split last year there.

What he means is that the blockweight is the new determinant of fees. There is a discount for the signatures' weight if you use SegWit.

I do think this is why the UASF is very realistic if it gains user support.  The incentive to mine on a level playing field (nobody using ASICBoost covertly) with more transactions in each block not only earns these participating miners more fees denominated in BTC, it will make those fees worth more too because the value of BTC will go up substantially when this activates as it will have overcome the scaling impasse and be in a position to enable layer 2 solutions.  
This really is letting those miners who are signalling in favour of SegWit and all those users who want it free themselves of the veto BitMain is exercising over progress, (most likely because they are covertly using asicboost).

It may not have been tested as thoroughly as we all would want, but it has been reviewed and it has been tested.  I don't support what has been done by that group, but the software they intend to run, which has been modified by them to be maximally compatible with UASF, does appear to be able to activate SegWit. Just because I don't like what they have done doesn't invalidate the fact that it will still lead to a smooth activation of SegWit. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:07:58
Without UASF SegWit2X would have had no incentive to happen and certainly would not have set its activation date prior to August 1st.  The github history on SegWit2X clearly outlines all this and it was a huge moment of truth when James Hilliard proposed BIP91 and changes to it to make it maximally compatible with the UASF. 
You may want to have others believe the the SegWit2X parties would have gotten together on their own without the threat of the UASF looming over them, but to anyone who followed closely it is clear that that argument is barely a circumstantial one.

SegWit represents a great deal of work by developers and testers.  It has been a surprise that some miners oppose it.  
Unfortunately, as the bitcoin user base grows, more people join who are uninformed and who have been misled about the benefits of SegWit.
Bitcoin as a system is always under attack from hostile players.  There are people pumping altcoins who want to make bitcoin look bad and to hold it back.  There are people with dominant market positions in mining who want to retain those positions and keep fees high.  There are media whores who want attention by creating a controversy where none should be through spreading lies.  The list goes on.

A little more detail would be helpful here. You can private message if you want. 
Anyone can send you money at any time and you don't have to know about it.  Now if they sent you money to an address that had never been used before it is because you gave that address to someone.

Ok, let's do this:
1. I have confirmed (and so have you) that all 9.88 bitcoins are at the address you provided.    
2. The two unspent transactions are: 6c361a485d8ebc2a82b4f7cfa6d95f0a4918afb880cee3b88920675212e6c58c which contains the 2.99974 btc Multibit is letting you spend and d903a79f6f534fbd321378a3ace67a9fa49bb1fa67cdf431c8cc8529e96cd8db which contains the 6.88546144 btc Multibit is not letting you spend.
3. However, since Multibit is able to spend the output at 12F9... of transaction 6c36... then it must have the private key for 12F9, which means if you extract that key, you can spend the output to 12F9... of transaction d903... .  So you are golden.
4.  You said that Multibit is crashing when you choose to "Reset Blockchain and Transactions", so that unfortunately indicates a problem meaning we're not going to try to use it.  
5. According to  there is an easy way to do this with blockchain.info.  I've never tried that.  My expertise is with the blockchain core full node wallet and it's not fast to do this, so you can follow someone else's advice or try the blockchain.info solution, but here's mine:
6. In multibit under the Tools menu choose "Export Private Keys".  It will create a plaintext file that contains your private keys.  If you let someone else get their hands on these, they can steal your whole 9.88 btc, so do export those keys and don't put them anywhere that someone else can see.  You may want to do this only after you've done the next step.
7. Download and install bitcoin core from  and let it sync, which may take more than a couple of days, and you'll need over 170GB of free space to install it.  (I did say this would be a pain in the ass, right?)  Hopefully you've already done this.
8.  In Bitcoin Core choose Help - Debug Window.  Click on the Console Tab.
9. Type in the command importprivkey, then press space, then put in a double quote like " then paste in your private key from your mulitbit private key file and then put another closing quote like ".  So if your private key was ABCD1234 then the command looks like importprivkey "ABCD1234".  Press enter.  Go grab a cup of coffee.  No make that a chai tea.  Go to a coffee place thirty minutes away to do this.  Take your time.  Read a magazine.  Come back to your computer.  Delight in the fact that it will show 9.88 BTC balance.
10.  Send user u/logical a PM saying you got your money back.

The miners do not actually have to mine SegWit transactions after Segwit kicks in.  There is no need for an added soft fork if a miner does not want to mine SegWit transactions.  They do not have to mine any transactions today and can, if they choose, mine empty blocks.  Miners that do not mine SegWit transactions will forego the fees of those transactions.  That's their only penalty.  However, keep in mind, not all miners are opposed to it and nearly 40% are signalling in its favour.
Miners however cannot expect to ignore the SegWit rules because if they do their blocks will be deemed invalid by every node (mining and otherwise) that runs SegWit, and that's right now over 80% of the network already.

It seems clear that those supporting the hard fork to bigger blocks and pumping altcoins were creating a fake crisis by sending lots of spam to clog up the network.

People who focus on short term price and don't fight for the long term value of the system will find themselves holding worthless tokens in failed projects.  
Bitcoin has a high price because for years its users and developers have persevered to respond to every attack on the system without compromising decentralization, immutability, and proof of work among other also important principles.  
Altcoins have a high price because there is a sucker born every minute. 
You may not like it that some of us fight for these principles. This fight offers you the freedom to hide in your basement without engaging in it and only to emerge when it is over. You're also free to leave by buying an altcoin or going to fiat. Or you could educate yourself and advocate for a solution your independent, reasoning mind has reached.

UASF is entirely backwards compatible so it is not about the share of nodes to make it run properly.  The share of nodes that need to signal to make the exchanges and miners realize that it is going to happen and represents an opportunity to quickly make money and end the impasse is probably in the 30% range.  We do need for most of the miners now signalling SegWit to actually enforce UASF for it to run well.  
Lots happening in Bitcoin now.  Ideally, the momentum of this movement leads to SegWit being activated even before August 1st because all miners signal, but that may be very very very very wishful thinking on my part.

Agreed.  The pull down on bitcoin was people selling eth and eth tokens into btc to then sell into fiat.  At the height of this thing BTC market dominance on coinmarketcap was 49.7%.  Things are settling down a little bit, but that doesn't mean they'll stay that way for long if another whale dumps an ICO or ETH.

There will be no chain split. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:45:51
You can "taint" your transaction with the coinbase transaction that's unique to a chain so you can split your coins (and services like exchanges will be able to do this for you).  Doing this is only possible when the coinbase transaction is spendable, which is 100 blocks after it is created, so moving these coins on-chain will take a bit of patience, but splitting them notionally off-chain on an exchange will be possible for all coins that were on there before the chain split.
@_date: 2017-05-21 09:58:00
IF the non-UASF chain is longer then it will not be reorganized.  The only thing that causes reorganization of the other chain is if the UASF one gets longer and the nodes that hadn't been enforcing the UASF see it as the longer consensus chain and drop the other chain.  So this is a possibility after 1 or even 10 months depending on how it plays out.  Much less likely after 10 months I think, but the first month or two are incredibly uncertain. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:36:57
This is not a problem. You already can, and should, have backups and passwords and multiple addresses to keep your coins at.  
If you are someone with any significant Bitcoin savings you should store your coins at multiple addresses and secure those addresses with different passwords and make backups of the wallets.  That way if you lose your wallet you restore from backup.  If you somehow reveal a password to a wallet that got into someone else's hands it is only that address that is in jeopardy.  
Moreover, storing your wealth in multisig addresses where you keep the private keys in separate locations or with separate co-signatories makes their theft and loss practically impossible.

Having 51% is a **desirable** condition, but not a **necessary** one.  Having 51% leads to essentially instant success and the impossibility of a chain split sustaining.  But even with 33% mining power (that's the amount currently signalling for segwit) the UASF will activate, blocks will be discovered and within 6 weeks the UASF chain will return to 10 minute discovery times.  
Once that chain exists, coins on either will be able to be split and traded.  I myself reason that the UASF chain will be viewed as tremendously more valuable than the other one for at least all of the following reasons:
1.  The legacy chain is basically a one miner chain, and that one miner is hardly trustworthy.
2. The UASF chain has all the developers supporting development on it (this is what caused ethereum to be worth 10 to 20 times the value of ethereum classic).
3. The UASF chain will activate segwit and have increased transaction capacity and be able to deploy layer 2 solutions.
Can you think of anyone who would prefer the Jihan only chain without segwit or developers over the Segwit chain with multiple miners, more transaction capacity and all the developers on it?

Now let's say a large miner or two joins in on signalling segwit before August 1.  The hash rate signalling segwit rises to 51%.
See, we can say anything.  The whole point of the UASF advocacy effort is to demonstrate the support this soft fork actually has with the users of bitcoin.  If it doesn't get the support then it won't activate.  If it does get the support and activates then the impasse about SegWit ends.

The volume and value of coins moving and days destroyed on the two chains will indicate what support there is if we end up with two chains. 
I actually don't know the specifics but I think spending with segwit would be an irrevocable transaction in support of the new chain as it would be spendable by anyone on the old chain.  Although I imagine there would be an easy way to split coins before doing that to prevent the replay problem in general. 
The situation is royally screwed right now unless one takes the view that both developers and miners are being prevented from hijacking the system.  If that's the view then everything is working hunky dory.

This is a very interesting post.  I have advocated for BIP148 and strongly, and without naivete about the fact that user nodes don't discover blocks.  What made me think it would work at activating SegWit before August 1st is more psychology than technology.  That is, miners have huge skin in the game and stand to lose huge investments if they drive users away from their chain or from bitcoin.  
I see it as validation of BIP148 that the NYA was signed and that its source code modified to be as compatible as possible with BIP148 without actually running BIP148.   
I don't actually know if we will have competing chains, A core-bitcoin vs a miner-bitcoin, later this year, but I don't rule it out. 
On the surface of it, I don't foresee the miner-bitcoin chain being terribly interesting.  I do think a core-bitcoin chain, which likely would introduce a PoW change, would immediately attract many GPU miners from all the other altcoins to guarantee its security and move rapidly but safely  forward on the core roadmap.  This will be good in the long term.  Very good.  
But because of this, I actually expect that the miners will avoid forking at every moment of truth.

Please do some math to support this assertion.  Global transaction volumes at present are in the tens to hundreds of billions per day.  Think about it, there's 7 billion people already out there transacting multiple times a day.  You cannot expect every one of these transactions to be recorded and sent in real time to tens of thousands of nodes.  It's not practical and it's not necessary.  The blockchain would have to grow by many terrabytes a day.  It's only surviving now because there's at most a few million people using bitcoin and they only use it once a month or less.
@_date: 2017-07-14 11:23:51
We shall see.  I think it will be pretty bad for the miners who said they supported it and who suddenly change their tune, because that will escalate the threat level on other miners and get them to activate BIP148 instead of SegWit2x.  Then the miners who wanted SW2X will get SW without the 2X.  Why will the other miners activate BIP148? because a betrayal at the 11th hour of the NYA without honest miners signing up for BIP148 will lead to a PoW change that will see all the developers and users migrate to that chain, stranding the miners and rendering their miners worthless.

A miner might be a narcissistic egomaniac who wants to take over bitcoin. 
If in a few months he denied service to the original chain and made a separate chain, and was able to deny service on the original chain for several months, expecting people to use the new chain, for sure there would be chaos, and for sure there would be people who used the new chain. 
I don't think the risk is something we face tomorrow but the trend is clearly headed in the direction of one party increasing their share of hash power to well over fifty per cent.

Not entirely.  If the legacy chain gets a 100 block lead, it will be very hard for the UASF chain to catch up and overtake, thereby making the reorg impossible.  It's gonna be a nail biter though if the chains are close in hash power.  
The problem of course for the legacy miners is that if they hard fork off, then the actual legacy chain and all legacy nodes will follow the UASF chain because they will reject any and all hard forks.
@_date: 2017-05-20 10:37:22
UASF or BIP148 doesn't care how many nodes are or aren't running it.  On August 1st it activates by rejecting all blocks that do not signal in favour of SegWit.  
A sybil attack of fake nodes from either side does nothing to change this.  BIP148 will only be able to build a chain of compliant blocks if there is enough mining power behind it to reasonably discover new blocks.  If there is no mining support, it will die.  Subsequently, it needs exchanges to support its chain so that the market value of its chain can be established.  
If the UASF chain is longer or threatens to be longer than the non-UASF chain, UASF wins.  The mining support is the most important aspect of success still.  It's just that we're not giving one miner a veto, which is how the current activation method has been twisted.  
While BU accuses those in favour of UASF of sybil tactics, it's a red herring and misinformation (like everything else from the BU side).

I'm being snarky, I admit, but I'm making a point that buying something out of ignorance is likely going to cause you to lose most or all of your money.  
The US$, which has been the reserve currency of the fiat world, while always expensive, has been the best of all those currencies to hold.  
Bitcoin is the reserve currency of the crypto world.  The only long term reason to hold crypto-currency is because it is money that can't be inflated away by government fiat or seized by banks and governments.  Bitcoin is the only crypto-currency that delivers on that promise and has a substantial user base and value.  All the other coins are either frauds, get rich quick pumps or experiments in some other idea.  
If you're just after making a quick buck, you would be better off playing around in the stock market or continuing to play poker.  The altcoins, just like the hyped up, no substance dotcom IPOs of the late 90s will massively collapse some time.  They were nearly worthless in January of this year and are now suddenly worth upwards of $50 billion.  That ship has also sailed.

Good article, as always.  The UAHF is about the most ridiculous and unlikely notion ever floated among the hard forks historically proposed.  It is a privately mined chain that gets created only if the extremely unlikely situation happens that UASF is activated but SegWit2X doesn't activate segwit AND it requires everyone to download its secret client upon its surprise release.  Just a total and complete joke on every level.  Kudos for talking about with a serious tone.

Let me answer your questions as best I can:
1) the block difficulty adjusts based on how much hashpower miners apply to the act of mining.  SegWit will not adjust the mining difficulty in any way. 
2) SegWit will not impact the time to mine a block.  The target remains 10 minted on average. 
I don't know how you got the impression that SegWit might impact either the frequency or difficulty of mining but it affects neither.  It does however impact fees and speed of confirmation in two ways. 
Fees should be lower for SegWit transactions because more of those fit in the new block.  
While block confirmations speed remains unchanged SegWit solved a bug in Bitcoin called malleability and fixing this bug means that second layer solutions, like Lightning Network, which can instantly confirm transactions will be possible 
@_date: 2017-07-15 00:14:36

1.  I've offered a logical explanation of why miners would want to keep the block size small and demand for space on the blockchain greater than supply.  
2.  SegWit is a block size increase by soft fork and is being prevented by four or five miners who are opposing it are the only ones rejecting it.  
3. How does it follow that these miners in fact want bigger blocks?
Now the objection by the developers and maintainers of Bitcoin to increasing block size by hard fork is not just "whatever" reason and it's not actually an objection to bigger blocks at all.  A hard fork requires a lot of time to deploy because it is not backwards compatible and users who don't upgrade will be left cut off from the blockchain.  That's actually the primary objection.  The proposal has been let's do SegWit as soon as it's ready, which was months ago, and follow it up with a 2 MB hard fork once we see the results.

The problem with this suggestion is that if bitcoin is not a long term store of value because innovators are always able to disrupt a maturing technology (which is what the innovators dilemma describes), then it follows that crypto-currency is a failed experiment since nobody will be able to store their value long term without risking it on an ever expanding set of alt-coins.  
Instead, I think bitcoin will do fine and remain the primary crypto-currency in the same way that tcp-ip remains the primary protocol for using the internet.  It's companies in the crypto-currency space that will be confronted with the innovators dilemma, not the primary protocol.  Now if bitcoin fails as a protocol then one and only one other protocol may replace it, but that is unlikely.  Bitcoin's uptime as a protocol has been 100% for the last 7+ years.

I'm actually agreeing that miners can do the attack you're suggesting and that it is even easier for them to do it than anything as tricky as a soft fork.  
If 51% of the mining power wants to ignore all segwit transactions and all blocks with segwit transactions in them and mine on the UASF chain then they can do an effective denial of service on segwit transactions and segwit miners.  
Miners can't get users to run software that will reject blocks with segwit transaction or to run software that won't make and broadcast segwit transactions, because the vast majority of the user base has installed Bitcoin 13.0 and higher, which they did because they wanted, among other things, SegWit.  
You can call that kind of attack a soft fork, and maybe it's only a technicality as to whether or not a soft fork actually eventually has to have users run software that enforces it as well, so I don't want to bicker about labels with you.  
But let's say this attack was executed by the 51% of the miners successfully and suddenly bitcoin is operating with a lot of orphaned blocks (those with SegWit transactions getting hunted down and orphaned by the 51%).  I think that would have a very very bad impact on Bitcoin and be incredibly expensive for the miners and users.  For one, miners in the minority would be orphaned out of any rewards.  Miners in the majority would be demonstrated successful attackers of the system, monopolizing block creation.  Users unable to rely on block non-malleability because miners continue to orphan blocks.  If bitcoin is ever at that point, bitcoin is dead.  You could expect with certainty users to revolt and change the proof of work algorithm if somehow 51% of miners were hell bent on destroying bitcoin.  Right now, the conflict of interest is in a battle over mining fees, but no side wants bitcoin dead.  So I think the likelihood of an attack by a majority of miners that would destroy bitcoin itself, and them along with it, is of negligible probability.

The above answer is what I would support u/evoorhees . But I'd add the important point of why so many of us support the UASF.  
That is because it is time to end the hijacking of bitcoin by the incompetent and the dishonest. We would rather have a chain split and reduced hash power than continue to be locked on to a chain where 1) thoroughly tested and professionally developed fixes are prevented from being activated using a rationale of easily verifiable lies; and/or 2) where a bunch of technically ignorant suits meet in private and hire one second rate developer to change the consensus rules of bitcoin.
This is us drawing the line over the shenanigans of all those fools.
Yes, bitcoin is an adversarial system that will always be under attack, but that doesn't mean we just have to let the attackers get away with their bullshit.  Craig Wright is an out and out fraud.  That he shared a stage with Jihan Wu and the BU people this week should send a very clear signal that nothing but shenanigans is what **all** these people are about.  What just happened to the mempool that was so badly clogged that we needed 8 MB blocks?  That too turned out to be shenanigans.  And, next, if you want to jam a one-developer built hard fork on to the network without any testing and in a three month window, good luck to you, but guess who isn't going along with it even if you did sign a piece of paper - everyone who didn't sign that piece of paper.  We are done playing this game where shit is spooned out and we are told to eat it.  "Eat your own shit" is what we're saying in response.  Bitcoin isn't the fiat game all over again in a technological setting.  It's ending that game.
Either you're with bitcoin as a decentralized, ruler-less, progressing platform for value storage and exchange or you're not.  If you join that ragtag group who find common cause in subverting this goal, whether it be for unnecessarily high fees, for 15 minutes of fame, to raise money from fools, to pump some alternative cryptocurrency or some other purpose, do so knowing you won't succeed in doing anything long term to bitcoin because its users will not tolerate it.    Bitcoin has chewed up and spit out all opposition to its main goal thus far and it will continue to do so.

That last digit is the only one that matters now.  It is the signal to activate SegWit. Any blocks that fail to have a 2 in that field will be rejected by the miners who activated the NYA's BTC1 code. The second to last digit was the activation of the BTC1 code.  It has already been activated. That code will actually trigger a hard fork in 90 days that will allow 2MB blocks, but it is uncertain now if anyone will be running it by then. (Miners running that code though no longer have to display a 1 there so we don't actually know who is running it.)
In short though, for the purposes of the next month or two there is no difference between these two.

I do not wish to repeat every paragraph I wrote.  
You’ll need to actually think about the argument presented instead of coming up with a preposterous counter argument that requires miners and users to be ignorant in general and unable to distinguish a Sybil attack from a genuine, widespread, grassroots effort.  
If you are actually naive enough to not be able to tell the difference or to not understand the argument presented I’d advise you watch out, because you’ll be suckered in by the likes of Craig Wright or Roger Ver.  
Running full nodes protects the network from fraud, from change and from having control seized by small and powerful cartels.  It’s really that simple.  There are multiple layers of checks and balances in bitcoin which would vanish if only miners ran nodes.  You are committed to writing a paper claiming the opposite so you don’t want to see this.  But it’s there, it’s real, it’s true.

Answer this - if only miners maintain full nodes (in fact it is only the mining pool operators who need to, not any operator of a mining machine who simply receives block headers and transactions to work on) how do you or I know that the blockchain is operating by the rules of bitcoin?
My answer is that we would not.  But if many of us users do operate full nodes we can detect, and thereby prevent, any tampering of the rules or transaction validity.  It is really that simple.

I should be clear.  Most of us who are on the UASF side want segwit and will also either happily or grudgingly take a 2mb hard fork with a reasonable roll out.  But there is no quick solution to do a 2mb hard fork.  None of the signatories of the Silbert accord have software for us to run.  
When we heard about the accord we thought the battle was over. But almost immediately it came to be interpreted as just a stalling tactic. The need to activate segwit in some impossible way. The lack of specificity.  The totally unrealistic suggestion to hard fork to undeveloped software by September.  How can it be interpreted as anything other than a delay tactic or a fool's proposal?

I'm holding my coins until they can be spent directly and have replaced fiat for the most part.  That's 10 years at the shortest I think.  If the price does crash or if there's a hard fork I will be buying the long term coins.  Those are the ones that support the Bitcoin principles

Today's addresses are hashes of ECDSA public keys.  Hashes are quantum secure.  But if a theoretical quantum computer came into existence, it is hypothesized that it could break ECDSA and be able to figure out private keys from public keys.  So payments to public keys instead of public key hashes are vulnerable.  Every straightforward transaction today is called a P2PKH or "pay to public key hash".   There's no more P2PK or "pay to public key".

Could you get your pool to conduct a poll among its miners of their support for ASICboost?  It was polls like this that got mining pools to support ethereum's fork last year.  If even just one pool started polling, others would follow suit and then the chances of BIP148 succeeding would skyrocket.

A bit of a branched answer here and feel free to ask followup questions:
If you are holding coins for someone else - i.e. if you have the private keys and they do not have the private keys for the address their coins are at - bitcoin cannot distinguish that those coins belong to anyone but you.  
Moreover, a wallet simply holds the private keys to a bunch of addresses (and recent versions of bitcoin core hold a "Hierarchically Determined" private key which can generate multiple other random-looking but predetermined keys).  
If not all those keys belong to you, for you to keep track of which coins belong to whom you must do so with a database.  This is what all exchanges currently do. The bitcoins in an exchange are theirs from a cryptographic perspective.  It is their legal contract with you that obligates them to give you whatever coins you have deposited there.  I'm sure you are aware that the largest thefts in bitcoin's history have come when exchanges have been compromised. 
Companies that offer online wallets, like blockchain.info, do not actually have the private keys themselves.  They store encrypted versions of the private keys that the users are able to decrypt online for use in signing transactions.  (I myself, don't particularly recommend using such a service for security reasons.)
@_date: 2017-07-14 09:44:32
Honestly, you don't understand how this works.  What you are describing is nonsense. You are saying that miners will collude to roll back SegWit to create blocks that are invalid on 80%+ of all nodes to build a chain that only laggards recognize as valid to send the stolen coins to themselves on a chain that everyone will ignore. This is not an attack but a fork that nobody will follow. Meanwhile the 40% of miners not involved in this hairbrained stunt would continue to mine valid blocks on the chain everyone was following. 
Sure everyone should upgrade but if they don't, the attack you're describing is a suicidal and ineffective one for the miners involved and presumes that 60% of miners are out to destroy Bitcoin which if they were they could do now by mining a chain with only empty blocks.

The UASF demonstrated the importance of non mining nodes.  It sent a clear signal to the 80%+ of mining hashpower that if they did not flip the activation switch on Segwit, their blocks would be rejected by those non-mining nodes.  Where mining had become a centralized cabal, the non-mining nodes showed miners that they actually did not themselves have the power to change the rules or prevent rule changes for which there was support.  
The miners have a lot at stake - huge capital outlays and high operating costs.  Their customers are at the end of the day the people who give bitcoin value.  Those people are able, through operating non mining nodes to enforce the rules of bitcoin and ensure miners don’t take over control.  If only miners run nodes, only miners make the rules and we no longer have a system with decentralized verification and rules enforcement.  
While the UASF was one example, the more likely future example will be when a government attempts to force miners (a small group) to instantiate some rule change.  Then it will be up to the non mining nodes to come to the rescue of bitcoin and demonstrate that such a law only has the effect of bankrupting the miners that comply with it.  Consider a government saying miners must change and mine the consensus rules such that an additional 10 bitcoins are mined each block and awarded to the government.  Miners (or specifically pool operators) may have to comply with the military showing up at their homes and businesses.  But with users rejecting such a change globally any blocks violating the users’ version of bitcoin will simply be invalid in bitcoin and just part of some stupid hardforked shitcoin.  
The battle to protect the integrity of bitcoin will heat up from time to time and it is precisely a large base of principled non-mining full nodes that serve as a might militia to mobilize to provide that protection.   By running a non mining full node you protect continuously against any surprise attacks of this sort and are positioned to quickly mobilize against any kind of known centralization based attack.

This is as best as I can tell the "contingency" plan that bitmain published in case the UASF split Bitcoin. However, since the UASF will activate 100% smoothly as miners are already executing its logic ahead of its activation it is unlikely anyone will actually mine  this coin.  
However, it's possible that it's mining difficulty will be adjust to near zero, since it's hard fork, and then blocks will be discovered. 
I am not going to justify this coin's intentions at this point by refuting them one by one.  I will just issue you the following warning: I suspect this is a way people will try to steal your real bitcoins.  They will tell you that you need to send them your old bitcoins and they will promise to split your old coins into new coins plus old coins.  And they will do this for a bunch of people until they suddenly stop and then steal the old coins and, having shorted new coins themselves, crash the price of old coins. 
In short, don't touch this toxic mess with a ten foot pole.

Bcash was a necessary event in the history of bitcoin to demonstrate its resistance to a hard fork by the dominant player in mining.  
It occurred simultaneously with another important event in the history of bitcoin, which was the users winning the battle to introduce new functionality that miners resisted (segwit) through a soft fork.  
Both of these events were absolutely necessary to occur at some point to demonstrate in practice what happens when miners try to take control.   
The first, the Bcash hard fork, is still playing out but it’s clear the outcome will be that it is severely punishing to those miners.  Jihan will be left holding a million or more worthless and useless Bcash coins instead of having made a fortune supporting bitcoin.  
The second of these clearly demonstrated the power users have over miners and the uselessness of trying to corner the users with mining power.  
We can thank Jihan for proving in reality, at his expense, that these are dumb things to do and ineffective. 
Now, at the same time a third thing, also important to the history of bitcoin was playing out.  That was a hyped up market of bullshit and lies to promote endless shitcoins and tokens.  Again, this is necessary to demonstrate the ineffectiveness over the long term of spinning up random coins without the right principles, community, technology, etc...    Those things have a long way to fall still.  Anyone trading bitcoin for shitcoins now is taking a huge risk and if they stay in that position long term they will lose everything.

I guess the reasons for buying bitcoin on Lightning network are similar to those for buying anything on it:
1) instant transactions
2) (likelihood of) lower fees
3) reduced blockchain congestion
In fact, since you need to buy bitcoins before you can fund a lightning channel, the best way to do it may not be to buy bitcoins on chain at all, but instead to have a merchant channel backed middleman open and fund a channel to you, by you paying him cash.  If this were the case you'd never have to touch bitcoin at all - you'd fund your lightning wallet/card with a cash purchase and then spend it anywhere they accept Lightning.

They would rather FUD gets spread and not integrated into the core client than turn bitcoin into another shitcoin.  I've written elsewhere, if you want a coin whose sole purpose is short term pumped value based on whatever is in fashion at the moment (ICO, confidential transactions, master nodes, pre-mine, etc) go ahead and buy that coin.  That's not what bitcoin is.  Bitcoin is a decentralized, worldwide, 100% uptime platform for censorship proof, non-malleable value store and transference.  Moreover, its core developers understand that this means you don't run it like a freaking web site where you release code and then roll it back if it breaks the site.  You start with theory, build, test extensively, attack, then release if and only if you know it won't break the network.  Core developers rightly don't compromise that.

There are several competing approaches right now to activate SegWit, the technology that will make certain significant improvements to Bitcoin.  UASF is one method and SegWit2X is another.  
If they are all made to be compatible with each other then the risk of a chain split is eliminated.  
The latest update to the SegWit2X code increases the likelihood that its activation will not conflict with the UASF.

The fork's apparent success was made possible by securing cooperation of 100% of the mining pools rather than anything to do with full nodes.  There's probably plenty of unforked full nodes still, but without the hashpower behind them, that fork is largely abandoned, for now.
The most disturbing thing about the ethereum process was the "votes" that were held.  Rarely did even 10% of miners or ethereum holders participate in a vote, yet the participation of a small minority was deemed sufficient to sway the mining pools.  This is the biggest danger to immutability.  Miners are motivated to make money and many, it turns out, at least in ethereum, care not for the principles of the currency, but simply for the mining reward, on any majority chain.

Of course, I would like to see that bring forward something acceptable, but the process is rushed and not as open as it might need to be.  But if it falls apart then BIP148 will become a freight train running. Which means the NY team will try hard to please everyone.  Which means we're going to get SegWit one way or another. Which means bitcoin's scaling debate will be over, which means that in 2017 we will see the launch of all kinds of layer 2 solutions.

What is strange about this statement?  What aspect of antifragile do you think my comment doesn't fit with?  Bitcoin is being attacked by a miner cartel and instead of getting weaker, it is getting stronger, particularly through movements like UASF. 
Correctly framing up what Bitcoin is is what you and I may disagree with. Sacrificing the future at the altar of avoiding a consensus failure is a big debate.  But I think it is that very risk which will cause the situation to sort itself out at the 11th hour.  Miners will break ranks and join UASF saying the risk of ignoring it is too high. And that causes a snowballing effect quickly.  But waiting for Jihan Wu to adopt SegWit is a fragile and hopeless manoeuvre.

If 80% of the miners signal for SegWit 2x, then those miners will begin rejecting all blocks that do not signal for the original segwit, ensuring that it gets 100% signalling on their chain.
If you understand what the UASF does, SegWit 2x plans to do the same thing, but only if and when 80% of the miners signal for it.

You just gotta wonder about how little some people understand about bitcoin.  A huge callout early in the article states: 


While it's true that bitcoin transactions are routed over the Internet, how the hell is that bad?  I mean, that's the point of Internet based money, right, that you can send it using the Internet.  
But worse is what comes after.  The suggestion that there are no integrity checks is preposterous, because the transactions are themselves cryptographically signed messages and the validation of the cryptographic signature by every single other node is an integrity check, which is undertaken at every node of the network.  
And worse yet, the notion that any third party can eavesdrop is irrelevant because all transactions are meant to be openly broadcast.  It's a public, peer to peer network.
And worse yet, the suggestion that anyone can modify or inject anything is outright false, because, the integrity checks of the signatures ensures they cannot.  
So all that is left is that someone can choose to drop or delay - i.e. not forward along a transaction or block, either for a long time, or never.  But that's why a node connects to more than one other node - in fact to 8 by default.  And moreover, nodes will drop connections to nodes that aren't relaying or accepting valid blocks and transactions.
There's a reason the network has stayed up without interruption for last seven years.  
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:56:58
Well, you can thank the UASF movement and its deadline of August first for creating the incentive for all the parties who support even only one of SegWit or block size increase to get together to try to activate SegWit before August 1st.  Two months ago, Jihan Wu was saying never to SegWit, calling it a stupid idea and an engineering nightmare.  Now he wants it activated before UASF kicks in.  Do you wonder who you have to thank for that? Is it the eloquent genius of Barry Silbert, or is it that a line was drawn in the sand and that line enforced that caused him to do a complete 180 on his stance regarding SegWit.  
If you signal you're in support of UASF too, those standing in the way of SegWit are that much more likely to back off.  
We are not a gaslight, we are a show of force that will prevent force from having to be used.  I do not think that we have anywhere near the power of the analogy I am about to use, but you can thank nuclear weapons for there not having been a world war three.  Nobody wants a chain split, and nobody would take us seriously if SegWit wasn't something that everybody knowledgable wanted.  If we said there's a UASF to activate a change in the block reward requiring coinbase transactions to be sent to an address we control, we would be laughed at and ignored as terrorists.  But we are asking only for SegWit as written and deployed by Bitcoin Core, and that's what makes our ultimatum so legitimate.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:50:32
Miners who are signalling SegWit will NOT be on the UASF chain because signalling for SegWit is not the same as REJECTING BLOCKS NOT SIGNALLING SEGWIT.  That's what UASF does. Those 31.7% of miners need to change their mining client to UASF to reject non-signalling blocks for them to split the chain.

Thanks for the mention there. I am and have been very clear that if UASF succeeds it is the only Bitcoin that there is and that there won't be another chain. There's all kinds of dangers in Bitcoin.  It's still a young tech and a lot of people are confused by how any of it works.  People still leave millions of bitcoins in exchanges despite the well known dangers of those coins vanishing. The truth of the matter is that we are at an impasse preventing the necessary progress of the technology.  I and others consider the miner refusal to activate SegWit a very obvious attack and the author of the activation algorithm openly says he made a mistake in proposing it.  So it needs to be fixed. And we don't have forever. And we have a solution. If there is any realistic chance of UASF succeeding, the fact that it will wipe out non-UASF coins will be enough to turn that into a certainty that miners will signal segwit.  Bitcoin is full of games that force consensus and this is another one.  It may succeed or it may fail but it is not very likely to lead to long term existence of two chains.  Right now, it's the miner who is holding us back to secure higher fees who has everything to lose, so with enough support he will back down.  He's scrambling already. That's what we're after.

Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency with the largest user base, the most stability, the most value, the best development roadmap, the most decentralization, the most global momentum and more.  
The challenges Bitcoin is facing today are the challenges that come with success.  Last January, (that's 2016) when bitcoin's transaction volumes were greater than what Ethereum's are now, there was no backlog and you could still send transactions for free. On Wednesday of this week, the first time Ethereum experienced for one minute volumes similar to what Bitcoin has had this whole year, the whole network shut down and fees skyrocketed.  That's to say that Bitcoin is operating, in the real world, at a scale far greater than any other alt.  
Bitcoin doesn't have a scaling solution problem.  It's scaling solution set is diverse and developed by the largest and most skilled set of open source developers behind any project. And the solution is deployed, but not yet activated.  It is going to activate though and this turbulence and drama is what is required to activate it.  
It does take balls of steel to be a long term holder of Bitcoin and to stick to the principles that will make it great.  None of the other alts has a community doing that.  They are all simply selling out as fast as they can to try to capture a slice of the value that Bitcoin has genuinely created. 
When you step back and look at it that way the choice seems obvious.  Just as during the dotcom bubble there were sky high valuations on ideas with no real business, so too today there are alts and tokens that fit that bill.  But after a shakeout comes the truly valuable players remain standing.  Right now, Bitcoin is far and away, on technical grounds and user base, the leader there by leaps and bounds.

That's a well written piece Erik. Its appeal to unity are strong.  Segawit2x is, however, both socially and technically a threat. The threat is very explicit too.  Miners and exchanges, without consultation with users and developers are going to impose changes on Bitcoin by using their concentrated power to deny service to anything but the changes they are imposing. Fifty eight guys telling millions how Bitcoin will be and how it won't be.  What kind of precedent is that? Especially with the added hubris of mocking and excluding the developers who built Bitcoin to where it is.  This is how the idea of decentralization is destroyed by those claiming to be for it, yet whose actions all betray it. And next time it won't be 58, but instead 1. And you will wonder "How did one person come to dictate Bitcoin?" And the answer will be "because you gave him the power."

@_date: 2017-06-23 11:13:55
That first question requires a very long answer and is essentially the whole history of the last year.  The best short answer I can give is that some miners held off on signalling for segwit because holding back scaling drove fees (which they collect) sky high and that there is well substantiated, but not proven,  reason to believe that Antpool covertly uses a technology called Asicboost which gives them a mining advantage but which is incompatible with segwit.  So they held off altogether on signalling segwit until the UASF forced their hand.  SegWit2X is a face-saving way for them to activate SegWit and say they wanted it all along.  That's my take anyways.  
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:42:24
All nodes are fully validating clients and servers of the blockchain. Miners are the only creators or new blocks which they relay to other nodes who relay those to other nodes.  All nodes fully validate each block before adding it to the blockchain.  
Also, each transaction you make is sent from you across the network so you are the server.  
But thinking client vs server in a peer to peer network is a bit of a mistake.  All nodes both receive and send and none are masters or slaves.

This is exactly why bitcoin is the honey badger of the Internet.  Those of us who want private money that is free from manipulation always have a defense against any hostile takeover.  
The value of a coin that has a different proof of work and all of the old balances of bitcoin and no hostile miners will be very high, both in terms of fiat value and in terms of societal value.  
Imagine if tomorrow all of the folks mining altcoins with small user bases could suddenly mine on bitcoin - they'd move their hash power there by the boatload.

Interestingly, you and I actually agree.  I think the answer to the mining centralization problem is for each of us users to begin investing in mining like many of us did before the ASICs took over. I don't know exactly how to do it, but I do think bitcoin users who don't mine, which include myself since I stopped in 2013 are not putting "work" into bitcoin and trying to get a free ride on the work that actual miners are putting in.  
Now when it comes to Jihan, if he wants to Hard Fork off, because users choose to run a client that enforces SegWit and other miners choose to mine on that, that's his choice, and my choice is to not follow him on that chain, because I think it's stupid.  
Bitcoin's security model has always said that coordinating 51% of work is a system vulnerability which can lead to double spending and censorship.  That's not new.  I think we've seen with BIP141 a new kind of attack which is a veto on the development community by a miner whose interests (and understanding) misalign with the rest of the system. And I agree that diminishing his share of mining power is the way to solve this problem.  But that's going to take a lot of convincing, and with the very legitimate suspicion that Jihan has a dominance advantage through the use of ASICboost, it's very hard to convince anyone to get into mining right now.

I don't think a single individual will all by themselves. A group however can change the consensus rules and fork the chain at a particular block number. Just a 2MB block size requires a hard fork and if some of the community doesn't go along there will be two chains. Ethereum hardforked last year and there's two versions of it now.

I think you need to look up the definition of altruism, which is regard for others.  I did not say Satoshi or I were not self interested. But there is mutual self interest in ensuring that there is a decentralized core to Bitcoin.  That's the principle.  I'm selfish in wanting and acting to have a decentralized platform.  And so are the core devs. And our selfish behaviour means we won't run JihanCoin or VerCoin or some other total piece of centralized, lying bullshit. 
I am not a collectivist and I abhor as immoral all forms of altruism. So don't put that word in my mouth. I'm a selfish individualist who selfishly runs software that other selfish individualists run to allow us to be free from others who think we should altruistically put their interest above ours.

I believe that the best chance we have to see a SegWit2X with any likelihood of core's support is if the threat of BIP148 exists. Core members are calling SegWit2X "frankensegwit" and making comments like "no one will ever run it".  You're holding out hope for an event that will not come to pass unless we force more compromise.

I'm neither naive nor ignorant.  I know that bitcoin will be attacked by those trying to corrupt it. I don't share your view that human nature is corrupt.  I think the pursuit of corruption is a free choice.  We aren't born evil.  And it is also a free choice in bitcoin to reject corruption.  This is because what software you run is 100% voluntary.  I do not have a choice about how much I will give to government in the form of taxes.  And I do not have a choice if they choose to seize my property.  But I do have a choice about what software to run that represents digital value.  I will run software that is decentralized, even if someone creates a centralized version of it.  Simple as that.

Scenario 1. The anxiety over UASF goes away even though it failed.  The discount baked in to the price associated with the risk of a chain split disappears.  (Not going to the moon on this one I agree).
Scenario 2.  Bitcoin activates SegWit enabling immediate on chain scaling and, more importantly, future off chain scaling solutions that make blockchain congestion a nearly negligible consideration.  This causes the price to skyrocket.  Altcoins that activated SegWit increase ten to twenty-fold after doing so.  I'm not saying that's going to happen to bitcoin, but I do expect it will be a large positive.
Scenario 3. Who knows really.  The speculation on the two chains may cause the price of one (in particular the BIP148 chain) to skyrocket in anticipation of its victory over the other.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:29:11
Yep.  Both UASF and SegWit2X activate the code originally written by core by creating a chain that only has 100% signalling for segwit.  UASF does so on August 1st.  Segwit2X does it when 80% of blocks signal for SegWit2x.

Excellent comment and smart on so many levels.  You're the first person I've seen to observe that the ICOs represent some form of crypto-**credit**.   
And although you're not the first, your emphasis on the true importance of SegWit - that it allows for innovation that's currently prevented by the malleability bug - is also spot on.

@_date: 2017-06-03 14:40:57
People who have been involved in bitcoin a long time want SegWit.  There's disagreement on how to get it.  Until UASF came along there was no solution to the problem and no incentive for the parties on both sides to change anything.  Now, there's a race to try to get SegWit activated before the UASF deadline.  You may think UASF is a bad idea, but the threat of it is incentivizing others like you to activated SegWit faster.  So I think we could agree that it's a brilliant idea in that regard. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:23:38
This is a very misleading piece of trivia.
The amount of energy that bitcoin uses is the amount of energy that miners voluntarily put into it.  In the very first days bitcoin only used one computer to operate.  
The thing with bitcoin's security is that people compete to win the mining rewards that secure the blocks in the blockchain.  If it currently is the case that 400MWatts are being used to mine bitcoin, it means that to undermine a recent transaction someone would need an additional 400MWatts of energy to try to re-spend the money that was spent.  If they wanted to go back 20 minutes, they'd need twice that and if they tried to re-spend something from an hour ago they'd need 6 times that or 2.4 GigWatts (which I think is how much power the time machine in Back To The Future needed).  This is what makes bitcoin transactions irreversible.  If you receive a payment from Visa, it can be reversed by Visa for up to 6 months, or if you have money in another electronic system and that system is hacked, it can be taken away from you.  To actually steal your bitcoins there is not only no computer capable of forging your signature in existence, it is not possible to create one using today's technologies because the computing power required to forge a digital signature of the type used in bitcoin would require a computer bigger than the galaxy.
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:17:21
And it's been like that for a long time.  Will they only build on segwit blocks is the BIP148 question?  If they all go that way this battle is over. There's another thirty per cent that is silent but will go whichever way the wind is blowing. And that adds up to 60% which in this case is a guarantee of 100%.

I think the actions of SegWit2X so far show that the miners don't want a divorce.  We will see about what happens when the time comes for the hard fork.  But that's because I'm not taking the hard fork part seriously yet. A developer-less, centralized hard fork has no hope though of being the only thing that's left standing after (and if) they hard fork.  The legacy chain will for sure remain, and it is hard to see how any exchanges or users or wallets will attempt to call whatever that thing is, Bitcoin.

Who knows what the Jihan side will do.  Things are very frothy today so we will have to wait to see how things settle down. Best case scenario is SegWit gets activated on or before Aug 1 with the majority hashrate behind it.  Then it's only one chain and that chain gets segwit.  
What you describe is actually a worst case situaion where some miners don't hard fork and don't enforce the soft fork and somehow get some users to stay on their chain too.  
I think everyone is afraid to become a fork that isn't seen as the true Bitcoin. UASF supporters aren't though because they know they are pushing for the principles of decentralization, fungibility, multiple scaling solutions, nakamoto consensus, immutability and open source.  The others are trying to cloak themselves as Bitcoin even though they are a centralized cabal trying to control the whole ecosystem in the hands of a small cartel of companies.

Yes. Personally, if I had been put in charge of the software development for SegWit2X I would have done the following: 
First, BIP148 with a late June activation date for the miners.  This would show the goodwill of the miners and not wasted all the effort coding a bit4 activation of a bit 1 activation with a reduced activation window that is complex, untested and draining. 
Second, develop with the full participation and involvement of Core a one year plan to create and roll out a sensible hard fork once the SegWit use could be seen in the real world. 
What's happening is no different in outcome, but just way more complicated and time consuming. 
The likelihood of the hard fork being developed safely and therefore being adopted is currently very low.

My comment states that the core code doesn't compromise decentralization.  Any core developer who attempts to rule bitcoin will either find themselves no longer a core developer or they will find that the users have switched to a fork that does not have that developer as a ruler.

The people on r/btc belong on the far left side of that scale.  It's not that they have low intelligence, they have negative intelligence.  Their brains do them a disservice.  They are angry at heroes and worship villains.  They shout down the truth and applaud individuals who to anyone with even a little bit of intelligence can see is a liar.

We'll cross that bridge in 5 months when we come to it. The first part of SegWit2X is segwit. And the easiest way to get that to turn on is UASF.

Read this and draw your opinion.  It's unnecessarily complicated at activating SegWit itself and there is not likely to be support for a hard fork in only 90 days after SegWit, especially since spam attacks that had been congesting the blockchain have suddenly stopped showing no need for a hard fork. 
I'm not saying it is altogether bad.  It's better than being stuck where we were before the UASF movement triggered this. I'm very happy to have the whole community behind SegWit.

Wrong.  Miners cannot find blocks more frequently than once every ten minutes (with 100% hashpower).  So by throwing away 24 hours worth of blocks (all of which are full) they lose 24 hours of fee collection even if they mine previously mined transactions because they are not then mining new transactions with new fees.

All the block rewards for all the now discarded blocks would be lost.  Miners would have to do the same work again that they had already been paid to do.  And the fees would also be lost to time because they’d have to re-earn those fees by doing work they’d already done and discarded.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:58:57
Also, I should add that there is a fourth possibility, which is that SegWit gets activated before August 1st because the NY consensus agreement is finalized and released.  In its current draft that calls for a way of activating SegWit compatible with UASF and legacy clients and ensures that there will be no chain split for activating SegWit.  (The subsequent hard fork by definition causes a chain split, but it is hoped that there will be consensus on that hard fork and that the old chain will be abandoned).

I really hate when people quote the bitcoin white paper out of context.  The sentence you quote, from the conclusion of the white paper, begins with the pronoun "They" which you hope the naive reader will assume to mean "miners".  But if you read the prior sentence it says:


Let me highlight the subject of that sentence for you: **NODES**
So substituting that in it says that **NODES** vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks...
The world has changed in the last 9 years and very few nodes are able to mine any more because of the extensive industrialization of mining.  But Nodes can still use their CPU power to enforce the rules of bitcoin and to express their acceptance of valid blocks.  That's exactly what the UASF does and your distorting the white paper by attempting to substitute "miners" for "nodes", a distinction which did not exist at the time it was written is a pathetic attempt to hijack it.  If you want to be honest about the white paper, search it for the word "miners".  It appears only once and it is preceded by the word "gold".  There is no concept of a separate faction of people or companies called bitcoin miners in the white paper.

How long have you been around?  This was back in 2013 when Friedcat's ASICMiner company was the first and only in the world making ASICs.  He mined with them and sold them.  His hottest product was a 1GHash usb key.  The hash rate was doubling every single month.  That meant if you spent 1BTC to buy a usb key that in a pool generated .5 BTC in the first month alone, you thought you were a genius.  Until the second month it only paid .25 BTC.  And then only .125 BTC the next, and .0625 the next, and if you mined until infinity you never would have gotten your one bitcoin back.  I was in a group buy for equipment and I owned some shares in ASICminer.  The group buy was a total bust.  We bought equipment for 50 or so BTC and our dividends were less than 10BTC.  My ASICminer shares paid amazing dividends and at one point I could have sold them for 2.5 times what I paid, but they crashed as his dividends fell too and I was lucky to sell my stash 10% of what I paid originally.

This dispute is boiling down to a confrontation on August 1st, but right now the exact outcome is unknown because the outcome will depend on the amount and kind of support each side has.
There are three possible outcomes:
1. UASF fails. Bitcoin goes on exactly as it did on July 31st.  People who installed UASF nodes need to roll back their nodes to be able to spend their bitcoins.  Everyone else is unaffected.
2. UASF succeeds. Bitcoin goes on exactly as it did on July 31st but with all blocks signalling for SegWit and SegWit activated within weeks.  All wallets are backwards compatible, nobody has to change any of their software.
3. Neither side is the clear winner and two versions of the blockchain emerge.  This is the scenario that has people scared.  All coins that existed prior to the chain split will exist on both chains.  However, if the UASF chain ever becomes one block longer than the legacy chain, all transactions on the legacy chain that occurred between the time of the split an the UASF chain getting longer will be erased forever and replaced with those of the UASF chain.  (This could happen multiple times if the two parties are in a close race, but it is likely that if this happens everyone will concede that UASF has in fact won and everyone will mine only UASF).
What will determine the outcome on August 1st is the amount of support that miners give to the two sides.  
If 50% of the mining power goes to the UASF it will almost certainly become the only chain because of the risks to the legacy chain I raise in point 3 above.  Nobody will want to mine or transact on a chain where the mining reward and transactions can disappear at any moment forever.  
If less than 5% of the mining power goes to UASF, it is unlikely to end up with economic support and most people will conclude that UASF has failed.
Miners and other economic players are watching carefully, but there haven't been decisive declarations yet stating whether they will mine UASF or legacy.  
Tune back in in July to see what the story looks like then.
If you do not spend or receive coins after August 1st until the outcome is settled you will lose nothing, but you can rest assured that many people will be trying to speculate on the outcome.

Absolutely I do not think that hashing power should be used to vote on what the whole of bitcoin's rules are. 
That is not the point of proof of work, which is hashing power.  The point of that is to prevent to jeep block discovery decentralized through competition.  
Changing Bitcoin is hairy business. It needs to be done in consensus.  It needs to be very hard to do.  The software needs to be extremely well written and tested because it is so hard to change. Miners are only one part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. There are also users, let's not forget, without whom Bitcoin is worthless.  Giving users no vote and only miners a vote is pretty much turning Bitcoin into a service offered by a private consortium of miners.  Absolutely not what the thing was invented to do nor what the users want, which is why the idea of miner voting has failed so catastrophically on its first big test.

If the NY agreement falls apart the UASF is the safety net.  Wu can threaten to keep 40% of hashpower from signalling segwit, but the other currently signalling miners can fall in with UASF and the remaining silent miners who had hoped for NY to succeed will realize they too need to signal for SegWit.  But just knowing this means that the ones who really want both SW and 2MB are going to do everything they can to make that solution work.  This is all true only because UASF is a valid threat against inaction.

Speak to a tax lawyer and investment advisor now.  There's lots of ways without bitcoin to shield those she wants to give money to from having to pay taxes, but jurisdiction matters a lot.  She can give gifts up to certain amounts now and jointly hold other assets now so that their ownership is not transferred through her will.  
If she wants to secretly purchase bitcoin and secretly give the keys to someone else, that's in a gray area of course, but that is very likely to be hard to be found out about.  But she could just as easily give cash directly to people she wants to.

I disagree.  If you think what we have now, with people continually abandoning bitcoin for altcoins and with no resolution in sight to bitcoin's current capacity is giving shit about consensus, I'd say you are wrong.  Specifically I'd say you are failing to identify that consensus on the status quo at the cost of a future consensus state which can handle scale is short term focussed.  I do want the NY agreement to succeed, but I know that its deadlines never would have been quick if it had not been for the UASF, and I do not know if it will have motivation to succeed if not for the threat of the UASF.  Calling UASF supporters altcoiners though is entirely inaccurate.  We are trying to end the logjam that has been the only fuel for the altcoin explosion.  We are an immune response to the current problem and our impact has already been felt.

This one block by Slush is like Rosa Parks sitting in the front of the bus.  It's only one block but it shows that the injustice of hijacking Bitcoin for high fees will not stand. 
We still have two more months to observe a growth in miner hashpower dedicated to UASF. This is like a snowball. If it gets up to 10% it will build enough momentum continue to grow and ultimately carry the day.  At 51% it is effectively 100%, but if it was 45% or even only 40% it would be a huge risk to miners not signalling segwit. And if at 40% it's a huge risk, who is really going to hold out at 35% and take their chances of being reorganized out of existence.

So I say that centralized mining is bad, especially when that one miner with the power uses it to threaten hard forks and hijacking of the protocol, and you come forward with this straw man argument alleging I think someone with "too much" hash rate needs to go (why you use quotes around something I never said is beyond me).

From that agreement:


How the hell can that be interpreted as "a hard fork will be rolled out within three months". How could it even be interpreted as "core will submit a hard fork pull request before segwit is activated"?  That agreement calls for rolling out segwit and then, within three months making a recommendation about a hard fork.  I 1000000% support that. It would be insane not to. But that is not at all what SegWit2X is doing with respect to the hard fork.

Sybil nodes being spun up and down by a mysterious user or users, probably do distort the count and credibility of UASF nodes. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:32:24
Hello newcomer.
UASF stands for User Activated Soft Fork.  In particular we are talking about a soft fork that activates a piece of technology called Segregated Witness.  This technology was developed by the open source community with extensive input and testing over a two year period and deployed to the overwhelming majority of bitcoin nodes nearly a year ago.  It fixes a couple of bugs that prevent some pretty amazing expansions to bitcoin, like off chain lightning networks and side chains.  It also allows for immediate on chain scaling.  It has been reviewed, tested and supported by every single well established bitcoin developer and by over 85% of the companies in the bitcoin space and installed by over 80% of the users.  Also, as a soft fork, it is 100% backwards compatible and breaks none of  the functionality and ability to stay on the same chain that 100% of bitcoin clients ever created run.  
Segregated Witness (or SegWit for short), although deployed and widely installed, is dormant.  It has not been activated.  The activation logic was that when 95% of the mining power signalled that they were ready for it, it would activate.
But miners got the idea that they would use refusal to signal readiness as a veto.  
The user community has countered with this UASF.  What the UASF does is enforce that after August 1st, any block mined by a miner that does not signal readiness for SegWit activation, will be rejected.  The software effectively says "your time for getting ready is over.  We are moving forward with SegWit.  If you're not signalling support, you're not on the bitcoin blockchain."  
In response to this UASF a group of miners and other bitcoin companies have scrambled to create what is called the "New York Agreement" or NYA for short.  
It is, with one developer, who has another full time job, trying to create a client that will do two things. First, it will try activate SegWit before August 1st.  That's good.  It does so in an unnecessarily complicated Rube-Goldberg machine-like way.  But if it does this then that's good.  Second, it intends to cause a hard fork on the bitcoin blockchain three months after activating SegWit.  A hard fork is 0% backwards compatible.  The expectation of the group behind NYA (which is also calling itself SegWit2X or BTC1 and which is disparagingly being called "BarryCoin" because Barry Silbert is the venture capitalist who arranged the NYA) is that everyone will update their software to support the hard fork within three months.  
Such a lack of backwards compatibility in such a short period of time is, in my judgment, crazy.  I mean, imagine if Microsoft suddenly said that the all versions of Windows that don't upgrade to their new version within the next three months will break completely.  That's what the hard fork portion of the NYA is going to do.
It's a crazy attempt to take over 100% of bitcoin clients in a crazy short period of time.  It won't work.   But there is the danger that participants of the NYA will pull out altogether when this becomes clearer.  That is why we must run the UASF right up until SegWit is actually activated.  Running the UASF tells miners that if they don't activate SegWit (in whatever way they choose to) by August 1st, they will be mining something different fork of bitcoin than the one the economically active majority of users is running.  
That's probably a lot for a newcomer already. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 10:39:33
Bitcoin's decentralization will always be under attack.  This particular episode is not even over, but we can analyze the history of what has happened so far:
1. BIP9, the activation mechanism that SegWit was released with, which was intended to allow miners to signal readiness, was instead interpreted by miners to mean they could veto SegWit activation until they got something else they wanted in return.  We were in a stalemate as soon as that happened and when it did, it triggered the altcoin value explosion.
2.  A UASF, AKA BIP148 was proposed to break the logjam by August 1st.
3. After the August 1st deadline was set, Barry Silbert arranged the for the participants in the NYA to get together and they emerged with an agreement to effectively activate SegWit ahead of the UASF and to attempt a hard fork sometime after that.
My analysis of this situation is that users and principles have won so far: An attack was launched by perverting BIP9's readiness signalling into voting.  A counterattack was launched in the form of BIP148.  The attackers backed down and will comply with the demands of BIP148, while trying to save face by obscuring their compliance in complicated chains of events.
Most important: We do not let one group of stakeholders take over bitcoin.  Miners are there to get paid to secure blocks and prevent doublespending.  If they want input into the code development, they are very welcome to provide input during the code development process, which is open source and open to all.  In this case, they never raised any objection at all to SegWit during its year long development, testing and deployment cycle.  To then have acted as blockers who think they have a vote when users don't is appalling and they got fed a shit sandwich and they are eating every last bite of it while saying this is what they wanted to do.
Next up, we'll see if there's any reason to hard fork after SegWit is active, and, no, we won't just do whatever the miners want because they did what they were supposed to do originally.  We'll only allow what's good for the long term success of bitcoin as a decentralized platform.

I don't care much for the libertarian label. I do think the idea of compromising the principle of decentralization is essentially throwing the whole thing in the toilet.  We already have centralized currencies controlled by powerful groups who meet in back rooms and decide how to make the rest of us lose economic power through inflation, rigged interest rates and financial institution fee regulations. If you support that in crypto, kindly stay the fuck away from Bitcoin for the rest of your life and take your central banker, crony, corrupt fascists with you. Ethereum is doing an excellent job of getting the participation of Goldman-Sachs, JP Morgan, Vladimir Putin and the rest of the people who strangle economic freedom all over the world. And they celebrate every time another one joins their new cabal.

The only catch is that they don't know that you didn't print the paper wallet twice - once for them and once for you.  Bitcoinpaperwallet does let you print the same wallet over and over consecutively.  But if you show them how to do this themselves, I think the approach is good.

You don't get to tell me what consensus is.  SegWit2X is alpha quality software doing things indirectly and in needlessly complex ways. No established developers who have reviewed it have given it a thumbs up.  You want to run untested, complex, unreviewed software?  Go ahead.  But expecting it to work or expecting it those of us who value excellence and the properties I discussed above is beyond delusional.  It simply will not happen.  And the value of a coin that has no decentralization, which has one mediocre developer and is backed by a single venture capitalist's investment portfolio and no users or developers is, in the long term, zero dollars and zero cents. Stop selling out and surrender any hope whatsoever that the Bitcoin community itself will sell out.  We cherish our Bitcoin too much to let it be turned in Silbert's bitch that he can hard fork at whim in a closed door meeting.  Watch as his piece of shit software does not get adopted, does not achieve consensus and does not get called "bitcoin". 
Having said that, I am actually aligned 100% with that consortium's goal of activating SegWit asap and I am going to evaluate the merits of hard fork after that, objectively.  That is what any sane person would do. But I won't stand to be told that software developed without the input of the public, that does things decided upon without technical experts in the room is candidate software to replace Bitcoin, let alone that it is the new consensus.

Low fee transactions are typically clearing nicely on the weekends.  There's currently 24,000 unconfirmed transactions in the mempool down from 200,000+ just a short time ago.  Bitcoinfees.21.co will give you an idea of how long you'll have to wait based on the fees you're prepared to pay. Right now a fee of only 91 Satoshi's per byte will get you in to the next few hours and double that will very likely get you into the next block. That's an ~80 cent fee for a typical transaction.

That's not exactly right.  We don't ask for centi-dollars, we ask for **cents**.  And we have units of quarter, dime (1/10th) and nickels (1/20th).  All of these mattered when a dollar was actually worth something.  
Starting with millies makes sense now.  If we get another thousand-fold increase in price we can move to micros.  
I'm weighing in with a vote for **milli** (or milly) as the singular and **millies** as the plural.  We don't need the bit part at the end (for the same reason we don't need dollars at the end of the word cents.  
In fact 1,452 millies is easier to take in that 1.452 BTC.  Three decimal places strains the mind.

As a holder of 22 shares (6 PT, 16 direct), bought on average at 2.5BTC, I'd say the following:
The risks are manifold: That bitcoin value could decline; That the virtual exchanges can go out of business; That mining hash rates increase such that Asicminer's solo mining efforts reduce in productivity; that demand for Asicminer's products decline or that its margins decline.
One thing that is not a risk is that Friedcat is dishonest and runs away with people's money.  He has demonstrated beyond any doubt that he is credible, organized and trustworthy.  He has built the first $100 million company in bitcoin's history (400,000 shares trading at over 2.5 BTC makes it a 1 million BTC market cap and with bitcoins over $100 a piece, there you have $100 million.)  His is the only company reliably manufacturing and shipping ASIC devices.  Asicminer's understanding, experience and profits put the company in a remarkable position as a leader in the nascent and growing bitcoin economy.
While I do expect the company to have to pivot in the future to remain large and relevant, I personally consider the shares very worthwhile at the current price.

Let me offer you some advice about what's good for you and your career.
First off, don't overplay your hand.  Be prepared to answer "I don't know" or "I'm not sure about this and I can try to find the answer later".  Second, don't be an irrational zealot if you're meeting heat or skepticism.  
Your career is a long term thing and so is the widespread adoption of bitcoin.  Don't force it with the setting of expectations that do not correspond to reality or to reasonable possibility.  
You don't have to convince them in one meeting that they must embrace bitcoin.  Help them get some comfort understanding some basics.  It's very fair and honest to say that this is a complicated subject and that as a payments company with a reputation to protect, a solid understanding is the essential first step and that that is all that should be a goal of the first discussions you are having.  
In short, become a partner with the head of product, helping him (or her) to understand what bitcoin is first and then what the opportunities and action steps should be afterwards.  Building a relationship on a solid foundation will allow you to build any business actions on a solid foundation subsequently.  
Apologies if any of the above sounds like I'm talking down to you - it is certainly not intended that way - just as career coaching from someone who doesn't know any more about you at all than that you work for this company and not its head of product.

I beg to differ.
The fact that additional virtual currencies can be created is a fact that exists and is a threat to BTC regardless of litecoin's short or long term acceptance.  
In 5 years, when the use of virtual currencies is widespread, expect government issued, government created virtual currencies to be the real competitors to bitcoin.  Some of these currencies will be built/backed by bitcoin and some will not.   
 
We're in for a very unpredictable ride.  
But your recommendation of  mining litecoins and selling them for bitcoins only puts litecoins in the hands of bitcoin holders and gives it greater legitimacy and distribution, which is precisely the opposite of the goal you have stated.  
Publicity and adoption of BTC is the necessary, primary goal at first.   Competition will come from innovation, not imitation.  There is a genuine issue with the fact that additional virtual currencies can be created and litecoin is only a singular example with little innovation over bitcoin, so it is not yet a threat to bitcoin.
