Not really especially considering that is such a small representation of the depth of this network. The higher the price is l, the larger the indicator of its adoption/acceptance.

Adoption can reflect capitol as much as it does an increase of it's users. The quality of adoption is also a reflection of money coming in whether its large sums from one person or small sums from many. One could argue that a more qualified investor willing to spend massive amounts of money builds more confidence then the average retail investors whoare bullish through FOMO. Either way, Price increase will always be a huge indicator when considering Bitcoin.

You can still be successful but on a soul level, be a complete loser. Roger Ver is a loser and probably fucks with his socks on.

I dont mean to be frank but You're acting like a pussy. If you don't understand what I mean by that then thats the main issue. What acting like a pussy means is that you are acting without principles. When you have principles you don't ask questions or propose statements like you did in your post you erased. Diligence trumps Doubt. Stop being a pussy and grow up already.  You don't join a conversation only to be sold another persons perspective or position. You create your own position based on connections through pursued research. Make sense?

Next step of adoption. People trust brands and once they see their brands facilitate some aspect of crypto ; legitimization grows exponentially.

None of these people are experts and people are naturally pessimistic, Bitcoin is fucking huge and people selling now are retarded. Everything is a gamble(Facebook, Snapchat, Apple) but when it has value agreed among many- it's adoption is a matter of time. HODL

The entire crypto market cannot survive without bitcoin. Especially considering the FUD induced to compete with Bitcoin.Roger chose a double edged Sword and ultimately executed the wrong strategy.
