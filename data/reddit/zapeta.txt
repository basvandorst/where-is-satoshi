I spend my bitcoin like a currency, by buying things from any number of retailers that accept BTC.  I don't think tipping has anything to do with it being used as a currency. 
Right now there isn't a lot that you can do with Doge other than tip it or donate it.

So, you can spend Doge at some retailers, and you can tip it.  You can spend BTC at some retailers, and you can tip it.  The only difference I see is that I don't feel bad giving my local bum $0.25, but I'm not going to give my local bum $100.  When the BTC price was lower, there was a lot more tipping.  I don't really see how the amount tipped has anything to do with Doge being more like a currency than BTC.  The exception is that they are planning on mining an unlimited amount of Doge, just like the U.S. can print an unlimited number of dollars.  In that respect, Doge is very much like a currency.

At least in my case, I actually spend more BTC now as compared to a year ago because there are many more places that will take them.

Good question, I'd be curious to hear the answer as well.
@_date: 2012-01-07 03:29:54
I was just referring to current difficulty but even at the current prices I'll still be profitable even if difficulty doubles.  
@_date: 2012-12-15 16:41:54
My electricity is cheap enough that I'm still coming out ahead mining, given the current difficulty and exchange rate.  Assuming the exchange rate stays constant or rises, I will continue mining until difficulty jumps when ASICs are available, or until the summer when my electricity rates increase.
@_date: 2012-01-06 14:57:36
My electrical costs are in line with the US average and all of my hardware is paid for.  If BTC prices are above about $2.50 per BTC I can make a profit.  As an added bonus I can use the heat produced for heating my home now that its winter.  Come summer, I'm not sure if I will still mine since I'll be running the air conditioning - it will depend on price and difficulty.

The only problem is everyone else is going to be trying to unload a ton of graphics hardware too.  Still, you'll probably be able to recover your costs if prices stay stable or go back up.

I'm holding.  I only wish I would have left some money in my MtGox account from selling around 30 to buy in again at 20.

I mine at slush with MtRed as backup.  I was pool hopping before that but depending on the NMC&gt;BTC exchange rate merged mining is more profitable than hopping according to my rough calculations.

It's super easy to set up and RPi and the USB Block Eruptors with [minepeon](  Plug the Block Eruptors in to a powered USB hub, plug that in to the RPi.  Flash minepeon to the SD card and start the RPi.  There is a config page you use in your browser to put in pool info, and that is basically all it takes.

If bitcoin goes to $1000, will it change my life?  It depends on where I'm at in my life.  Right now that would be a huge difference, but in a few years I plan to be in a secure and well-paying career so it might not be as big of a difference. 
If bitcoin goes to 0, no problem, I haven't put more in to it than I can afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-04-26 03:11:40
Ah, I was just going off of [ to estimate your hashrate.  If you get 500 Mhash/s, plug that in to the mining profit calculator - it might be just enough to break even or come out ahead.
@_date: 2013-01-10 01:55:57
Yes, been mining for quite a while.  I mine with 2 GPUs - 1x HD5870 and 1x HD5850.  It provides me with a small amount of daily profit based on my winter electrical rates, current difficulty, and the fact that I'd be heating the house anyway.  The hardware is long since paid for so I don't have to worry about that cost.
I don't think mining is currently a good investment, given the impending debut of ASICs and huge increase in difficulty that will follow.  I would just buy the coins on the open market and sell as prices rise.  Had I done that in the first place I probably would have made a much larger profit than I did mining.
@_date: 2013-03-24 05:29:14
I got in on mining right when GPU mining was taking off, but I wish I would have been in earlier too.  To be honest though, I'd have a lot more bitcoins if I would have just purchased them with all the $ I spent building and operating mining rigs.

I've been using [cgminer]( to mine in windows for a long time now.  The setup is a bit more involved than guiminer but there are a lot of features available.  If you follow the readme.txt it will give you the commands you need to get mining at the command prompt, and you can dig in to all the advanced features from there.
One note though, your virus scan may pop up and tell you it is unsafe, but as long as you download it from the link in the first post of the thread you are fine.  Apparently some people are bundling cgminer with various trojans, etc.

BTCJam is a peer to peer bitcoin loan site, but most of the loans are for larger amounts.  I don't think there is a organized site for getting micro loans short of just asking on bitcointalk.  
This should give you enough to take care of it plus some to cover any transaction fees.  You can tip me back once your coins come in.

If you are lucky, you'd get 5-10 Mhash/s on either of those chips.  10 Mhash/s gives you about 0.0006 BTC per day - so no, not very effective.
If they have a decent AMD based graphics card they might be somewhat effective at mining BTC, depends mostly on your costs for electricity.

I've got about 25 BTC tied up in bitfloor.  
There is a guy trying to buy up the debt so that he had enough to make it worth the time/effort for legal action.  He's buying the debt at 0.05 BTC per 1 BTC tied up in bitfloor.  The main problem is that bitfloor collects their fee on the USD side of the transaction, so the increase in price has only made it more difficult to re-pay people, even given the increasing number of transactions.

@_date: 2013-04-26 03:02:04
Almost definitely not worth it due to your electrical costs, but it depends on exactly how much electricity your entire system would use while mining.  You'd be lucky to get 100 Mhash/s out of each graphics card, and you won't get much at all out of the CPU - 10 Mhash/s or so probably.
You can plug your numbers in to the [mining profit calculator]( to get an idea of your potential profit.
@_date: 2013-01-10 02:42:44
I agree.  There are already tons of people who have dropped big bucks on ASICs.  It remains to be seen how quickly they can make their money back - whoever can bring their ASIC online first may be able to make a significant profit while they control a large percentage of the hashrate, but that probably won't last long.  Making the jump to ASICs was out of my price range anyway and I'm just not confident on the return I would earn.
@_date: 2013-03-26 13:52:36
It really depends on where you live - that being said, I'd try [local bitcoins]( and see if there is anyone nearby that you can buy a few coins from.  Buying that way requires essentially no verification, just cash in hand.
If you're in the US and want to purchase off of an exchange, the easiest to use is [bitfloor](  You can make a deposit to them at any Bank of America branch or using P2Payment through a Capital One 360 account (formerly ING Direct).

There was a guy ages ago who was posting all over craigslist offering this sort of deal...except he wanted you to purchase the graphics card, run his program while you were idle, and then paypal the money to you.  
GPU mining will be pretty tough going forward as difficulty climbs and ASICs come online.  That said, the major cost for GPU mining is electricity although wear and tear does cost over time.  If you live in a dorm or don't have to pay for power, anything you can mine is essentially free, and you could turn your GPU power to mining litecoins and convert that to bitcoins once difficulty is too high.
Also, now you've got 2 bitcents...

Yes, but it depends on the order that dividends are paid.  They are sent out by Friedcat to the holders of direct shares.  The passthrough operators then take the dividends they get for the direct shares that the passthrough holds, and then send the dividends out but all of that takes some time and isn't on a set schedule.  Sometimes ASICMiner-PT pays dividends before TAT-AsicMiner, but today TAT paid before PT.  So in that case you wouldn't be able to take the PT dividends, reinvest in TAT and receive dividends for both.
@_date: 2013-05-17 10:24:37
TAT-ASICMINER keeps 5% of the dividend as a fee, while ASICMINER-PT pays out 100% of the dividend.  Despite this, I think TAT has better liquidity due to the lower price.

I haven't followed namecoin very much over the last months.  Namecoins can be used to register .bit addresses, although you need to use a different DNS server in order to be able to use the .bit sites.  If you decide to keep mining you can find a pool that has merged mining where you mine both BTC and Namecoins at the same time - for example, Slush's pool, BTCGuild, etc.
Lots more info about namecoin [here](

If you are planning on GPU mining, just be aware that ASICs are on the horizon and difficulty will increase as they are brought online.  If you pay for electricity it will be more effective to buy bitcoins than to try and mine them.
