Bigger sites may not work due to anti fraud measures that can't be deployed in your country.
Localbitcoins is not 100% secure but it does hold the bitcoin on their site so if you did say you haven't received it then the other person would not be able to get it back.

That's correct, it's like moving your cash from your bank to the underside of your bed (for your second question!) 
For the former, perhaps the risk of damage coming to the wallet?

Good luck with it and remember to stick to the high repped traders :)

I don' think women should be the target audience at all, rather the entire general public who know nothing about bitcoin past that it earned some people a lot of money

discrimination in the bitcoin community? What has that got to do with either mining or purchasing bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:20:55
Well that links back to the idea of risk no? Women are generally more risk averse so of course something like a cryptocurrency would be a horrible investment.

What part would be alarming? the fact that some people dont treat bitcoin as get rich scheme or the fact that they had dreams of bitcoin being the first decentralised currency?

There's no charity involved then isn't there? No one is going to mine in the mean time to secure the LN

Is that the fault of men who have invested in bitcoin since its inception? Or rather perhaps women may be more risk averse and avoid speculative assets such as cryptocurrencies?

Do you think bitcoin would exist today if people didn't get rewarded with bitcoin by mining a block?
@_date: 2018-03-17 01:03:32
Perhaps if you treat it as investment, but a lot of early adopters had much loftier ideals for bitcoin, potentially being the currency of the world etc
