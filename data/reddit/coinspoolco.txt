Well Bitcoin gives you freedom over your money. Obviously with freedom there comes the responsibility, that you need to take care of your money, its just the matter of choice. If you want to control your own money, you choose Bitcoin, if you want someone else to take care of your money, and pay some fee for their service you choose banks. I prefer Bitcoin !

This is why I switched from iphone to htc one, and I love it. No more apple product in my household.

Just check the first transaction date .. i doubt its the MtGox stealing address.
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:19:26
It hurts my brain already
Edit : wow it was nice. sushi, trains, fukushima, but nothing about gox. :D

This is an awesome thread ! Thanks round-peg for this. Me and my family will never again buy any apple product in the future !

Nice minimal design. Make sure its opensource and I will use it.
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:04:42
Because the solved block will grant the bitcoin to the pool, not for himself, and if he changes the bitcoin address, the block invalidates.

I switched to HTC One, and I like it much more than any genereation of the iPhone.

Well, make it yourself, and if you are doing money with it he will see it was a good idea. You can't convince anyway ^^
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:49:50

Yeah, you can mine any sha256 coin, but pretty much thats it.
@_date: 2014-04-04 02:59:18
Yeah implement it for sure.

Well his email domain is Hungarian. Can you post the header of the email ?
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:10:06
Well its quiet simple. You buy something at a given price. Are you willing to sell it cheaper ? If yes, why the hell did you buy ? If no, then wait.

If you take over 51% of the hashing power you can only stop transactions from being confirmed, you can not generate coins for yourself. If you take over 51% of the nodes, you can fork the blockchain, but that needs very deep knowledge, and an accurate timing attack and a bit more than 100.000 bitcoin nodes. If you spend 10$ on a vps to run a node, that would make 1million$, a bunch of time, and the success of attack is not guaranteed in anyway. And even if you fork the chain, and you want to make money out of it, you will need to mine those blocks, which will take some time on the current diff if you are doing it with couple of GH even TH .. probably people would notice it before you mine a tenth of a block.
@_date: 2014-04-16 23:42:40
Yeah that would be fun, when the government buys all those sha miners, we switch the hashing algorithm :D

I have couple of btc, bought 800$+ and mined as well, and im not selling in the near future, no matter whats the price.

Lol, 50TB only ? I do already own about 30TB of hard drives at home, and Im not a hard drive collector. This is nothing for a server machine already, and in 2024 the basic vps package will come with 50TB.

I am totally IN with this idea. If you need any help for management/coding contact me here, and I will help for non-profit.

I think someone with bodyguard services company should offer him a free protection against harassers. He deserves it.

I hope someone will buy that 8.5k up and the guy will be crying in one month that he sold those coins so cheap.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:42:16
It wouldn't be hard. If we get to the point that our group take controll over mtgox.com domain, simply we just need to add a notification after login about the changes, and he can decide whether to continue membership with us, or to remove all his associated data from the database.

I love your comics :D

You just need to wait, after 5-6days uptime i have somewhere between 60 to 80 connection.

abs(abs((Your money before crypto hype)-(Your money now))-(Your income)+(Your money spent on other than crypto)) = Your money spent on crypto

Well obviously the multisig addresses will solve this problem. There will online wallet providers on 10Gbit networks, they will have 1 of 3 key, and you will have 2. Whenever you want to make a transaction you generate a transaction with them, then you sign it with your key, and broadcast it.
