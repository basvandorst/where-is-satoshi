noone cares about those questions, only what counts are memes, and this is what angers me, community on this sub is getting ridiculous, feels like bunch of kids trying to get points
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:18:50
I'm from EU and so far I haven't had problem with them, but I hear lately ppl waiting long but then again you have to understand the past week demand is so high, they are probably doing their best
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:07:54
I don't know but I would be glad if that what you just asked would be on front page and discussed
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:33:12
why is this so hard to do, I don't know what are we waiting for. Keep waiting and BCH will wipe us if you like it or not. And I hate BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:26:31
someone can't steal btc by hacking ur email, show transactions, more details
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:51:13
Just move away from them, with that you will force them, once they start losing customers they will change their minds
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:31:42
well bitstamp working fine for me, no complains...people complain lately cuz they have to wait but yea demand is high sorry but be patient I guess
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:22:25
bitcoin has the best engineers, I believe solutions will come but rushing something is stupid
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:45:52
so you telling me the best way now is just pretending that we don't have a problem I guess, lets spam the memes on front page, good job
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:00:55
I believe in our developers bc I know they are the best, I just really want that to be discussed more on here, I wanna hear that we are actually going forward. I rather see post about all the problems we are facing than cheering that we reached 20k with some stupid meme
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:21:12
probably huge BCH supporter spreading FUD
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:13:43
my calls it bitocin
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:03:41
Noone wants to talk about it on here looks like, they are enemies now lol. Big threat looks like 
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:36:23
BCH taking over lol
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:30:03
lets bump this up, I wanna hear reponses
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:09:16
so as someone who bought at 6500 would you suggest getting out going in back cheaper or getting that free b2x and selling...not sure i wanna do...
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:06:35
all that meme spam is destroying this sub and is sad tbh
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:45:39
you don't own your private key
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:42:48
I was in gold before I knew btc exist
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:08:58
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:43:47
yes, eventhough, hardware wallets are the best, so if you have a bigger amount u definitely wanna have a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:01:23
I still havent moved my btc from exchange to ledger, so you saying I should do that, but I wouldn't get it since its canceled and ledger won't support it right
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:51:12
I'm waiting for my money to come on exchange, I'm gonna just buy it, im going long term, holding and I wouldn't invest if I wouldn't believe in it. So tbh fuk waiting for dip, that feels the worst and you always miss it anyway or end up buying it higher at the end
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:47:18
futures, google what futures are
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:24:10
I'm 99% sure u went on a phishing site
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:52:53
okay, thank you guys !!!
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:43:08
so what, it will get better, difficulty adjustment for b.c.h. will happen and miners will eb back in full force
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:26:13

@_date: 2017-11-18 16:55:40
I'm far away from 1...
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:16:16
well this community doesn't allow talking about bch yet people are switching now to bch....Spreading awareness and talking about why bch is not bitcoin would help a lot but whatever
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:53:27
i was in before made this post :D....I'm really thinking that for now with rest I should buy LTC because people will move into altcoins after fork, what do you think
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:02:48
I'm using bitstamp, with credit card i'm paying pretty large fee, my money is on the way but it will get through monday, maybe too late
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:01:00
so any news on that
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:46:51
2500$ now lol
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:59:30
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:42:26

@_date: 2017-11-08 14:17:44

@_date: 2017-11-29 08:52:55
yea but gold will scyrocket in financial crisis, crisis will come, i'm not sure how btc will react in crisis, my only concern
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:40:58
stocks boys stocks
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:14:57
lots of transaction going on right now, u have to wait
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:19:12
Please let us know how it goes. You are one lucky guy if u get that btc
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:34:34
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:48:39
Use Bitstamp, they are great especially for EU 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:01:52
yea but for all this coming true, btc need to hit 100k so people see we don't fuk around and they start dropping fiat 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:02:46
really 1,8million is not enough, I can live with that for 5 lifes lol
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:48:04
okay, but now i'm gonna send the rest and it will change again, so basically I will have 3, and even if I would send on previous ones I would still get it ?
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:30:54
well for me I know I won't become a millionaire even if btc goes to moon since I can barely afford small amount, I wish I could buy at least 1 btc...
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:39:43
how do I do this exactly?
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:37:31
feels better do buy dip than ATH
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:03:46
Price need to gooo upp so even like 0,1 btc will be worth a fuk ton, this is when people will start using btc and spending it more, this is how fiat is done when everyone starts using btc, but we need price higher for now
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:18:55
it was mine, can I get it back, gonna sue you 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:38:43
will appear in your wallet eventually
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:51:41
so whats your plan, buying altcoins, when altcoins surge move them again into btc ?
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:20:04
Congratz, you are lucky one....Most of us can only dream about that :/
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:08:11
this 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:09:23
nobody knows bc bitcoin was not around in financial crisis in 2008
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:26:42
damn, that sucks, hopefully you are in now and still gaining from it
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:47:17
I mean 2fa, its a hardware wallet, you need a device in order to get in, so I really don't see much point in 2fa
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:36:15
you went on a phishing site most likely 
@_date: 2018-03-05 09:19:29
I'm happy with my ledger nano S, don't need that
@_date: 2017-09-29 09:14:04
can this post be removed since is misleading, he was on fake site, it's his fault not exchanges
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:34:05
Why on earth would you use margin in such volatile market, just don't 
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:32:49
I doubt exchange did anything, most possible would be that you were on fake site, the fact that you lost your coins when you wanted to log in kinda shows you were on fake site or something imo...
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:47:02
If you invested smart just hold, come back after 3 years, if you invested more than you are prepared to lose is your own fault
@_date: 2017-09-07 08:34:54
I've never seen such low volume, this is so weird
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:32:26
If you ever look closely at order books on exchanges you can clearly see what's going on. Keep in mind that these "huge" orders are constantly popping on and off, sometimes switching sides etc. You clearly see that this is the work of "whales" or people who own huge amount.The reason is definitely trying to push price down or up at least trying to hold it down or trying that it doesn't go lower. Also keep in mind that whenever these huge orders are set, as soon as some huge buys/sells will actually going through they will immediately remove that order and than set it again higher/lower. This tells you they never want to sell/buy, is all a game.
@_date: 2017-09-22 08:17:17
maybe you could explain yourself and help others not to do same mistake, we have no idea what are u talking about lol
@_date: 2017-09-10 08:02:08
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:04:31
and what is the point of bitcoin if government can control it, its not a free will, they can do whatever they want
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:00:32
I haven't seen anyone yet that would lose coins on ledger, I'm not worried. Plus just send your funds via using one of the old addresses, are previous are working
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:14:41
tell me when fake news are official denied, thanks
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:19:27
what i'm seeing recent, most common people go on fake site, so check your history and see if you used a scam site
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:53:45
hmm if it was software wallet and your old computer is gone I'm not sure what can you do. Thats alot of money today tho damn
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:15:45
any news ?
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:24:00
well its your own fault not making your own dd before investing in anything, blaming others for your own stupid action is very easy, taking responsibility is hard
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:40:49
i'm doing it via bitstamp and as far as i know fees are like 0,25% so I really think fees are ok
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:31:40
best wallet blockchain.info imo
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:29:41
Can you help me how do I access private key, There is a process for exporting, via 12 word seed phrase and then doing it with Bip39 generator. Do I have to do that to get my private key ?
@_date: 2017-09-25 08:05:41
because 4k is not little for an average person
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:44:51
Bitcoin and after 5 years 100 Iphones
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:17:09
hello, did you do that, if I follow that process wil I get my private key ?
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:21:35
all I see is more price manipulation lol
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:35:43
I'm EU, but also fees on Bitstamp are probably higher right...Plus i'm not into trading, i would use it just to purchase and after i'd send it to my blockchain.info wallet and hold it, im investing
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:50:57
not sure i'm gonna believe that, you had 387 btc and didn't afford a hardware wallet, give me a break, i just don't believe it
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:52:11
futures rising, mining rising, how excatly are we killing it rn lol
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:22:40
but shouldnt you but owner address there, im so confused 
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:40:21
you lost only if you sold and if you sold at these levels, that was very dumb sorry
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:25:27
i'm about to get my ledger nano and reading all this is confusing but as long as coins are not lost is okay I guess, is there a possibility coins get lost in uncomfirmed transaction ?
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:59:26
too much confusion, this is why i will wait so this is over and then i'm going in 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:02:30
does this happen with trezor too ? I'm still debating which one to buy, reading all this make me wonder lol. And with all that fork going on I feel like i'm just gonna wait
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:06:55
so what does this mean ? Is there a chance that price in CNY would be like 1000 $ for btc but here 4000 $ for USD. Can this happen ? I mean I expect withdrawals as we are going closer to october on china exchanges, doesn't that mean price drop for sure 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:33:32
blockchain info isn't bad, most cases are people mistakes, that guy clicked on fake site lol, not blockchain fault, small amounts are pretty safe
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:31:43
well not everyone gonna buy trezor, waht do you suggest then
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:45:42
my ledger nano s is on the way
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:38:51
I agree but most are rather blind to it....I'm sure segwi2x is real threat 
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:03:52
its not blockchain info fault, if you have such amount you will be target so just buy trezor at this point....no one cares about average person having 1 btc so that most likely won't happen to you
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:58:15
segwit for lower fees
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:32:28
This is what I like to see. While media and all others are focusing only on bitcoin price and how it is a bubble, our great developers are doing a great job for a bright future and making sure we are moving forward step by step. Good job and let's continue !
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:00:52
ok, even if withdrawal from bitstamp is free?
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:50:50
yes im asking because of fork and I know transactions may take long plus I need to learn using ledger....I'm using bitstamp, every security possible is on so I think I'm quite safe
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:21:20
im waiting and buying after
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:22:02
if I buy btc now and send it to ledger and leave it there im ok right
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:41:23
most people lose it going on fake sites I learned and usually 2FA is enough....otherwise im getting my nano s so ill sleep good 
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:45:49
you have no idea what wallet you made ? was it online wallet ?
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:25:44
is that when it asks you if you wanna configure as new device ? so you choose no and then enter 24recovery seed ?
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:08:42
anyone know, does ledger come in a box so I can see if it was compromised or something, what should I look for once I got it ? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:09:57
should i put it immediately after into my ledger...i'm scared of getting that b2x shit
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:25:33
seems like always same story, people going on fake site, are you sure u werent on that side before aswell, check more further into history.....I guess you gotta eyeball that http address nonstop to avoid it. How much did you lose if you mind asking ?
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:46:15
people don't care, until trumps bans it, then I know people would care lol
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:38:53
okay I understand that but what about private key, where do I see it, as far as I know as long as you don't have private key you don't own bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:40:32
one downside is maybe aswell that you need different chrome apps for each crypto, while in trezor everything is together as far as I know. But i don't care much 
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:10:12
what do you personally use, what wallet ?
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:14:17
what about my current public address for btc, eth. will they be the same or new one ?
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:47:54
or is it ? LOL
@_date: 2018-03-05 09:30:35
Why on earth would you pull out everything
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:59:35
btw how does it arrive, is it in a box ? I wanna know how to make sure is not compromised, i'm gonna buy it from a shop in my country but is 100 % legit shop so I shouldn't worry but still
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:58:12
bought what I can afford to lose, holding for a long time, feeling very very good...my biggest biggest fear right now that i won't be able to resist not to buy more....so hard
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:23:30
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:22:25
ooo okay, thanks
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:55:31
I'm stating facts, I'm sorry you are a hard btc fan
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:21:21
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:26:55
reference is "message" you got or ? I mean even if address would be wrong I don't think address is what counts...But how you know is bank, and why do you say in Estonia ? does bank there say you have to put bank address ?
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:46:32
why is that good news, derivatives only means more price manipulation
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:08:12
its not regular transaction bitstamp actually support ledger and is additional option
@_date: 2018-04-08 07:52:46
good job
