@_date: 2017-12-20 13:54:29
Because he's not a communist.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:09:52
Ok man. This is getting funny now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:40:58
You will always regret this day and comment. Specifically the sell.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:12:34
We aren't at 19k
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:15:31
For real
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:34:56
I love how hard bch has been crashing
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:11:26
Local bitcoins. But tbh you shouldve tested a withdrawel first.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:48:22
Newcomers are so obvious they care about price too much.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:10:20
Nah just recovery imo
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:03:09
To me....there are tons of people who win the lotto. Some people steal and scam in crypto. Coinbase hasn't lost any credibility at all there will be more and more information soon. People need to fuckin chill.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:54
Just hodl its fine 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:34:35
Done it too befor this time idc sometimes i sleep through these drops.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:36:30
But how can they even trace that?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:44:57
My favorite thing is BCH dying a little.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:32:32
True as fuck
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:13:54
It was easier is usd didnt go below 10k
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:46:45
I just sold to usd at 17500 gonna wait for some cheap coin. Perfect.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:46:54
$330 in june 2015 here, fell to $198 by December.
Its crazy to think that it has multiplied this much if the rate keeps up at 10x per yer in 2018 i might finally retire. Probably still hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:04:59
Why is the comment everywhere wtf.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:24:27
Why is everybody so mad it just looks bad for bch not bitcoin itself. Hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:07:58
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:27:13
Down with Ver shapeshift my bch to ltc before its crash.
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:36:22
how so? if im getting real gain?
edited: not a refferal link now
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:25:33
Well I've heard it comes from transaction fees 
@_date: 2015-06-21 04:10:43
Good to know everyone thanls
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:44:01
I see that as a possibility but not for long
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:14:19
Cant tell if you are being sarcastic by referencing a video from a time it began to rise significantly or.....
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:07:46
I doubt it will dip significantly lower than 4000
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:31:45
Definitely 
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:15:10
Admit it, the rally wasnt over.
@_date: 2017-08-19 07:29:42
Hodl is the ultimate plan anyway its the only way to feel good about a drop
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:22:51
I roll my eyes so hard at anyone who complains about a correction that still lands at an all time high.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:39:15
Yeah i know, still pointlessly talking shit its my thing.
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:22:21
This comment line is like a brain activity meme
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:14:57
Thanks for the edit lol
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:11:56
I doubt genesis did
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:03:14
4600 right now, maybe another rally?
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:35:46
A heavy fall like that is atypical unless another mt. Gox or bitfinex happens.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:46:40
Chill out Zoom out
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:31:18
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:08:47
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:18:12

@_date: 2017-09-01 23:23:20
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:42:22
Ok Forbes.
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:14:18
We got a pessimist after the new alltime high?  Typical, thanks for the cheap coins for about 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:30:31
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:19:31
Mt. Gox shut down and scammed people.
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:18:09
Sold most mine. I still get .1 a month mining. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:01:02
This might be on coinbases side, it just happened to me as well
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:55:30
Mine finished
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:39:39
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:32:19
"0" lmao
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:36:40
Things are running slow for sure. Waiting on a deposit for almost 24 hours now.
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:32:47
Genesis mining does that today.
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:31:05
Well, mt. Gox was the real first big scam and a ton of people got spooked by it. The price is far less susceptible to things like this now. Last year when bitfinex was hacked i believe we lost over 20% in value vs the mt. Gox debacle.
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:13:43
Www.badbitcoin.org best resource to not get scsmmed
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:19:14
I know lol
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:12:25
You got scammed
