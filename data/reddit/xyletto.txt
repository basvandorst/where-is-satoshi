BitFinex wasn't the only exchange with BitGo's insurance. What does the insurance even cover?

Why are you trying one of the chinese exchanges? I know there's all this bitfinex fiasco, but you should be fine if you don't park your money there.

Your coins have been "exchanged"

Kraken and Bitstamp both use cold storage, which I believe are more secure than the Bitfinex arrangement, even though all of them are using BitGo. No much has been said about how all this got through BitGo, but I think Bitfinex has allowed themselves too high a limit before BitGo steps in. The lesson here is how to compromise security and convenience. When times are good, we want good service fast, but when shit happens, we regret our decisions to compromise security for convenience

VanityGen basically tries many different inputs until they get an address with the beginning you want.

well, BFX should have spent that dough beefing up their security to start with. Just a cautionary tale for the rest of the other exchanges still surviving.

from what I see, loanbase and btcjam are some of the more popular places. However, returns have not been positive, and it is difficult to get your btc back when a default happens. imo hodl your bitcoins

By extension, you could use one of their databank watches!

I can imagine that this blockchain needs to be big. Really big. Probably will need a blockchain for each field given the amount of data we see today
