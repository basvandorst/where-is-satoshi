I buy Bitcoin at a high price, tell all my friends im gonna get rich. They buy the top, feeling their gonna get rich. It dips and they all yell at me and call me stupid. Then they sell low and then it climbs and they yell at me again.

I think a lot will be gone due to failed development and no use case. A lot of coins on cryptopia won’t be there or just won’t gain value.
