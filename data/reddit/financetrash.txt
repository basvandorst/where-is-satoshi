That's not true lol. You can't justify the price of Twitter stock via that model. The price is based on the perceived value of the company (psychology not math).

1. Deposit USD (Could take 48 hours for first purchase. My first took ~12. After your first deposit, it's MUCH faster.)
2. Convert to SLL
3. Convert to BTC
The fees are high. ~9% after both conversions. However it's still the fastest way to get BTC via USD

If you look at their expense reports, it's a joke. I'll never dontate to wikipedia. They have a huge surplus of money that they mismanage and spend amongst themselves rather than towards the benefit of wikipedia.

Bitcoin went up 5000% this year alone. Odds are you will have more than you put in in the long term. If you need the capital though, it could be a while before you recoup your money.

Most of the purchases were probably bought as christmas gifts. The recipients of which haven't recieved their gift yet. Even when they do they probably won't be as bitcoin savvy as the person who bought the gift for them. So if the recipients buy it probably wont be with bitcoin.

 Matt you did a really great job of trying to explain a very complicated system that you only started looking into a few days ago. It's really important that people understand the difference between hacking bitcoin and stealing a wallet. If a wallet is sitting on your computer and isn't password protected. I, a hacker, could hack into your computer and steal ALL of your files. This includes your bitcoin wallet. If that wallet is password protected, then you don't need to worry. This is the same thing as keeping your credit card number in a text file on your computer. Other instances of bitcoin theft include fraud where organizations pretending to be legitimate bitcoin sites host people's wallets for them. So instead of your wallet being on your computer it's on a website instead. This is probably what you are doing with coinbase. These fraudulent organizations then turned around and kept all of the bitcoins. All instances of bitcoin theft could and do happen with credit card information. The difference between the two is that people give out their credit card information all the time, and every site you give your credit card information to has all of the information neccesary to commit credit card fraud. Compare this to bitcoin. You don't need to give out your private key to perform a transaction. The private key is used to create a hash. The hash proves that you own the address, but unless you have a quantum computer there's no way to reverse the hash and find someone's key. This means the only way for someone to steal your wallet is to hack the computer that your wallet is being stored on. With a proper password, there's no way a hacker could ever unlock your wallet. Bitcoins wallets can even be stored offline for even more security. Given the flexibility and unique nature of the system, there is currently no currency/store-of-value on the planet that can be as secure as bitcoin. If I keep 1billioin dollars in a bank, the bank or govt could seize these funds for whatever reason. If I keep it in cash or gold I can only keep it in one place or multiple places split up. Meaning if someone found one of the locations they would have that portion that I hid. With bitcoin on the other hand you could hide partial keys multiple places or with multiple people. If someone found one of the keys, it would be worthless to them without the other parts. The keys can also be encoded in messages and images, so no one would even know what they actually are. It's simply mind blowing. The kind of stuff movies are made of. Try doing that with your credit card!

lol gambling. you're a loser in this market.  you aren't going to magically start winning. stop throwing money away. an investor is someone who buys knowing that in the LONG TERM the value will go up. you chicken out on every loss. you don't have the guts to make it. put your cash in bonds and apologize to your sister.

@_date: 2013-12-11 18:09:43
Let's put it this way. If someone were to break Bitcoin's security, you'd have a lot more to worry about since every other security system on the planet relies on the same principles. When people say 'decentralized' they mean there is no central entity in charge telling the network what to do or defining what software everyone has to use. If Bitcoin was ran by a company then you could worry about the possibility of them exploiting a backdoor, but since its ran by tons and tons of people just like you, there's no way that a founder can do anything to exploit or control the system.

What were you trying to buy online? You can use local bitcoins to get btc for cash instantly. There are also sites to convert USD to BTC within 48 hours for the first transaction and then immediately for all transactions after that, but the fee is almost 6%. You eliminate the waiting period and volatility, but you pay for it. Essentially you bought bitcoins when they were worth more than they are now. But this can be avoided if you use a different service to buy your coins.
