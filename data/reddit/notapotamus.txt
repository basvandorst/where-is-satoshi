More so than a bit coin. You can jot your grocery list down on an envelope.

Gold has intrinsic value, Bitcoin does not.

Gold has intrinsic value, Bitcoin does not.
The fact that you don't understand the term "intrinsic value" means I'm not reading 4 paragraphs of bullshit typed up by some guy on the internet who doesn't understand that basic concept or how to look it up.
Intrinsic value my friend. Gold has it. Bitcoin does not.

If you often laugh when you've been proven an idiot then I have some bad news for you...
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:56:33
Yup. All it takes is a few well placed news articles to get the normies to panic and boom.

You're fighting a straw man. Stop it idiot.

Yeah, seriously. If you can take a bubbling investment and use it to get rid of interest bearing debt then you damn well should.
Not doing so will cause your wife to eventually leave you for someone with a goddamn lick of fucking financial sense.

Smart, richer, financially wise hypocrites. LoL
When an investment you have bubbles, you dump it and laugh all the way to the bank if you've got a lick of sense.
