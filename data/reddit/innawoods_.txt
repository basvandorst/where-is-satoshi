How much is blockchain.info, then?
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:58:59
I've been lazy about moving my coins out of coinbase. I'm doing it now.

Somewhere in Texas
Cody Wilson pauses from working on his carbon fiber gun blueprints
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:01:49
[He certainly was](
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:23:11
To me, it looks like the main guys started their own thing. Wilson with the Ghost Gunner and related stuff, Buterin with Ethereum. Dunno what's happened with Taaki or the others.

[Cool meme bro](

But of course. See, by simply being born you signed with the blood of your placenta into some invisible social contract that allows other people to do whatever they want to you.
Social Contract is to Atheists as God is to Theists.
@_date: 2015-05-10 18:18:32
Oh it totally is, but they made up some bullshit called the social contract to make you think that you have already agreed to it.
@_date: 2015-05-10 02:23:25
This is ridiculous, clannish attitude to take towards other technologies. Enjoy becoming the thing you're trying to defeat.
Hell, if the shitcoin beats the bitcoin, can't it be said that the bitcoin is the shitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:46:32
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:50:49
No, it's not. It's actually psychotic aggression masquerading as righteous outrage.
@_date: 2015-05-10 02:50:56
If one of these "shitcoins" "beats" bitcoin, then was it ever really a shitcoin?
How about debating the pros/cons of a technology, rather than just sticking a "shitcoin" feel good sticker on it until it has a bigger market cap or transaction per second or whatever?
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:02:32
Disappointing effort. 1/10.
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:46:29


Fucking lol. Like what?
@_date: 2015-05-22 23:50:30
That too.
@_date: 2015-05-10 03:06:11
I'm sure other devs are terrified of a shitty meme video. Enjoy it.
@_date: 2015-05-13 19:44:23
The "rebuttal" of someone intellectually bankrupt.
@_date: 2015-05-13 19:05:06


Try it.


A useless parasitical class.


@_date: 2015-05-10 03:35:35
You're unaware of the origin of the crap you're peddling?
Color me unsurprised.
@_date: 2015-05-13 19:05:39
I don't take any of them for granted. I am completely aware of how brutally inefficient and costly they are to society.
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:58:16
He never said it does......
@_date: 2016-02-22 19:47:37
"All of the above" is an option.
@_date: 2015-04-10 23:09:23
A lot here seem to hate it ;)
@_date: 2015-04-24 01:22:36
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:10:39
Right. But apparently when crypto startups do the same thing, they automatically become shitcoin scammers.
@_date: 2015-04-05 17:06:36
It's kinda not.....
@_date: 2015-04-05 17:05:43
Wrench swinging techniques are only effective if people using effective crypto are in a tiny minority.
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:27:47
Guess Cody Wilson was right after all!
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:56:22
Somewhere deep in Texas, Cody Wilson smirks, then goes back to assembling little CNC machines.
On a serious note, lol. Lol lol lol. Fuck the Foundation, the bullshit act they "stood" for, and their endless apologists.
Edit: yessss, give your statist tears. Thats how it will only ever end for youuuuuuuuuuuuu
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:11:17
Explains why you're full of shit.
@_date: 2015-04-05 17:04:35
@_date: 2015-04-23 17:45:04
I mean, that would be great, but what is OP doing?
