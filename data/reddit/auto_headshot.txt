Should add that BRK.A was an undervalued textile company when he purchased. Currently acts as his holdings co.

The 0.18 coefficient screamed empirical, and then you acknowledged. Cheers, I like the attempt and use of safety goggles.   
Would like to add that any projected model using historical inputs exclusively, is missing inputs. Personally, I think Market Cap is a great metric for the purposes of observing utilization and social acceptance, the latter of which is near complete given Cramer's PSA to the sheepo.  
Given fiat currencies have an infinite market cap, gold makes sense to use for comparison. Gold currently has a market cap of $7.0 trillion, while BTC is at $55.0 billion. Rounding the current number of BTC in circulation up from 16.4 million to 17.0 million in coins, and setting the BTC market cap to $4.0 trillion (giving a $3.0 trillion discount for possibility of lower social acceptance than gold and perhaps less demand for BTC), results in a per coin price of $235,300.  
Conclusion: brb, converting my 401K into BTC.

Near zero understanding of engineering here, can you ELI5 on how they plan to preserve heat and temps? Heat transfer laws would make this terribly expensive esp in the frozen pits of Russia, no?

It's a paper loss. And frankly I could care less what you think is funny. Your username says a lot.
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:25:19
Only a loss if you sell.

people will be kicking themselves again for selling at $3000 when they could have sold for $300000.

Still need to have a list of words to back up right? So we're back to a paper wallet. Unless you eat said paper and await mother nature.

Just ordered mine. Set for July delivery.
Why buy 2? Bait? Lol.

That's a really neat idea...  
I might just do that. Stamp the letters on gold, my crypto on my metal.

What were you buying for 13 BTC ? Do you typically transact this much without test payments?

Aww man... sorry to hear. Thank you for sharing your story, hopefully we can all learn collectively.
