Just to add, I recommend using bitmex testnet (play money) until you've got your head around it

They are entirely different forks. 2x will not have replay protection.

Hey can I ask you, been trying to figure out the formula to work this out. It's easy to find the formula for % risk/reward for forex trading but I can't find out how to determine the pip value for cryptos. Not sure if I'm being super dumb, math isn't my strong point.. Just want to work out position size per trade, so how many contracts to buy (and how to factor in leverage) to always risk the same % if total capital, taking into account variable stop losses. Do I still need to work out pips like with forex?

Well said!

It's the kind of thing that is used all the time in retail. For example, one might void a transaction from a webstore if the buyer's details seem off and you suspect a stolen card. With credit cards, the retailer is often the loser in case of fraud. The CC company can return funds to the card's owner if they report unauthorised purchases, after the retailer has sent the goods out to the fraudster. This is a major advantage to being able to compare shipping/billing addresses and other details given at checkout for suspicious signs. Bitcoin is inherently unsafe for the seller in this respect. Being able to void/refuse a transaction is an example of the sort of functionality that is imo essential for future mass adoption, unless other security protections for sellers are possible.
Edit :actually thinking about it, with bitcoin once the retailer has the funds, they can't be taken away, so my point is kind of moot. I guess it would be the con's real owner who would lose out and the fraudster who wins...

It's scary though isn't it? Or off-putting at least when it comes to large amounts. We all know not to carry too much cash in our wallets for this reason, but if you want to secure a high value in cryptos you need to keep it split between different computers and wallets, in different places with different keys and seeds hidden around the place. Or, ironically, in a safety deposit box in a bank, lol

Hey, I work as a frontelier, in Switzerland but I live in France. I have a CHF account which I never use. Instead I get paid to a non-Swiss euro account to avoid exchange fees as all my expenses are in euro. Do you happen to know what the
Swiss tax rates are on realising BTC to CHF? I'm tax resident in France but can avoid French tax so long as I supply evidence of Swiss contributions instead.

Gods this is exciting to follow, €5300 down to 5022 in 25 mins and back up to 5126 in 3mins... and I just shorted, woop!!!

You started 9 years before BTC launched? You must be a trillionaire!

My private rule is to buy every day it's down, whatever I happen to have disposable that day, even if just a tiny bit! So if bitcoin's up, I'll have a nice lunch or go for beers, if it's down, I'll eat toast and buy more BTC :) It's hard to know where this dip will bottom out but I've bought quite a lot today because $5450 right now seems pretty sweet and y'no, YOLO
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:13:02
Yeah I thought of that after, see my edit. So in that case the problem is a lack of protection for the buyer. Basically, you're completely responsible for your own BTC and have no recourse in case of someone using stolen keys to spend your money.
I have no strong feelings on this and I'm a huge BTC supporter but it's just an example of where there are anti-fraud protections and procedures with fiat that don't (can't?) exist with cryptos, which will slowdown the adoption.

Well, I don't know. just been watching on and off since I woke up about 12 hours ago...back from work at 6:30 and sold at 7pm (France time) at 5298 (euro) thinking it had gone up so much a drop was likely, but I'm ok with buying back in at a small loss if it kept climbing for another hour, so not gambling by much. Bought back at 5030 yaaay

Planning to hodl long enough to buy new hair.

Yes, but on condition that whatever you put in is truly disposable income. I believe it will turn out a solid investment, I think there's an enormous amount of growth to come (but obviously nothing like the % gains of early adopters). The important thing is that I have other investments/savings, I'm just stacking BTC for the moment. If it all crashes and goes to heal, well I could take that hit, so why the hell not. What do you think?

Checkout out bitpay as suggested and got excited about the bitpay card, visa debit you charge with bitcoin, would've been a perfect solution for a european visitor... except you can't order one from here. Damn. Thanks anyway!
