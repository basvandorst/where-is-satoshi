As soon as those coins move, the value of bitcoin drops. If a *lot* of them move, then bitcoin will tank.

Do you use TOR for all of your browsing? I don't often see people in the wild using it for casual browsing.

Anyone can host a mirror of it.

You can make GIFs not loop. Try stopping it on the last frame where the QR code is fully scannable.

The context surrounding that quote includes the algorithm. Try being a little less pedantic.

Can we please stop looking to Mt.Gox for the price? They're out of their minds, no one else is nearly as high as their price. I know it's all exciting and we want to break records faster, but let's not cheat by using a shitty source. I go to [bitstamp]( for the price.

For Mac and Linux, use [Transmission](
For Windows, use [Transmission]( or use [Patchy]( (shameless plug for Patchy, I made it)

Would you like to hear a story about why the EFF is awesome? Read on.
You probably used a [Texas Instruments calculator]( while you were in high school or college. Inside, they run on a z80 CPU, with (varies) 32K of RAM and a megabyte of Flash storage. It's possible to send official OS updates to these calculators, which you can download from the Texas Instruments website. These OS updates are signed with 512-bit RSA keys to prevent anyone but TI from distributing them.
There is a small (probably less than a hundred) group of calculator hackers that toy with these calculators for fun. A couple years ago, one of them [realized]( that 512 bits isn't much for a cryptographic signing key these days, and set aside a computer for a few months to crack it. Well - it worked. The community had gained the signing keys required to push our own third-party operating systems to these calculators.
Unfortunately, TI didn't like that. They sent DMCA notices to everyone who mentioned the keys. This is a gross misuse of DMCA, and the EFF stepped in to help out. TI turned tail and shut up, and we continue to use these keys today to develop our own operating systems for TI calculators.
If it weren't for the EFF, one of my [biggest and coolest projects]( wouldn't exist!

These guys seem pretty cool. They saw that thing I did with brainfuck early this year and called me offering a job interview. After browsing their site, I could tell that they're a kick-ass place to work for. I wonder if they'd pay in bitcoin.
