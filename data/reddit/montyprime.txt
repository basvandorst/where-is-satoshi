You got it from market growth. If you need to fudge a single transaction, check the records and architect a trade that matches your gains.  They can only validate what you give them.
If you traded once a day, the IRS expect you to turn in a list of 365 trades.  That is just once a day.  The record keeping is ridiculous and no one should have to do that.  Nor should a gain be considered a gain until you cash out back into cash.
Like I said, if you cannot find a way to keep this crap off the books, then don't trade in bitcoin.  Only long term invest, short term is just nonsense under the new tax code.

Paying for an external service makes no sense.  Exchanges make a lot of money, they should be providing a tax readout.  They already have to assemble this data to report it to the IRS.
@_date: 2018-09-26 18:53:32
I never got big into altcoins.  Mostly just juggled between eth and bitcoin.  The tax nonsense in the US pretty much convinced me to stop.  It wasn't worth it.  Paying tax any time you swap one coin for another is insane.
As I said, if binance isn't reporting to the IRS, then it still is the place to be.  I simply wouldn't recommend any coin dealing if you are in the US and a site reports to the IRS.  At least unless the exchange manages your tax liabilities and lets you know what your current taxes owed are so you can cash out and keep that covered as you buy and sell.
I think it is crap that these sites will report to the IRS, but won't let you see that same data.  Making you manually assemble that data in spreadsheets or use a 3rd party service makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:46:07
Any exchange reporting to the IRS can let you see your taxes.  They are already compiling.  Anyone not reporting to the IRS allows you to avoid reporting all the transactions.
@_date: 2018-09-26 18:27:36
I do know that, but are they reporting to the IRS.  Their were two benefits to binance.   Discounted trading fees which they were getting rid of over time if you used their coin and then avoiding IRS crap just because you swapped one coin for another.
Binance let you just report any eventual gains all at once when you moved it back to a US exchange to cash out.
If both of those benefits are gone, there is no reason to use binance.

China has gotten away with it because they heavily tax goods made by american companies so the chinese knock offs are that much more competitive.
An iphone in china costs more than in the US because of taxes even though it is made in china. The iphone clones are dirt cheap.
Trump technically is just doing the same thing to china that china does to us.  The problem is that we don't have cheap US made alternatives, so trump is fucking over the US economy because he doesn't understand this.

Too bad that failed when every exchange started asking for multiple forms of ID and your social security number.

These negative changes are all due to banks and credit card companies lobbying their congress critters to put the breaks on bitcoin.

China has the upper hand because they build everything there.  The US doesn't have access to electronics without china.  If apple shut down it's iphone factory, they just start making iphone clones instead for all markets outside the US in the same factory.  It doesn't actually shut down.
Meanwhile all the US companies that require cheap parts and raw materials from china are closing up shop.  We might temporarily save 1k steel mill jobs, but everything is going to topple one by one until all US manufacturers are gone.
It would be nice if china stopped taxing out stuff more than their stuff, but putting a gun to the head of the american consumer and threatening to pull the trigger isn't going to get china to change a damn thing.  And unlike the US, china will happily take that saudi oil money.

Just not true.  They didn't prosecute because they already had him in jail until he dies.  They even allowed the charges to be barred from being litigated in the future because the government doesn't ever need to anymore.  Ulbricht exhausted his appeals, he is going to die in prison.  Unless they felt someone was killed and wanted the death penalty, his case is over.

It is just too much money.  If you want to use bitcoin, sell it and buy the car.  It don't get the need for tesla to do this for you.

Conspiracy theorists are hilarious sometimes.  I saw the interview with his mother where she kept pretending misconduct unrelated to her son's conviction by feds should invalidate the jury's ruling.
The people supporting this guy are in extreme denial.  The charges were dropped after he used up all his appeals and it was guaranteed he would die in prison, they don't need to litigate those cases.
His life sentence means he stays in supermax and will not be allowed to go to a minimum security facility.  Which is another reason they waited for his appeals before dropping those charges.  They don't want him going to a cushy prison.
This guy is going to die in maximum security prison, there is no reason to try to charge him with anything else.
Even if you believe he didn't try to place hits on people, it doesn't matter, he is still going to die in maximum security prison.
By the way, your link confirms the jury heard all the evidence about the murder for hire plot and believed it.  Stop acting like this stuff was fake.
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:38:10


I agree over sentencing in this country is insane, but I don't disagree with him getting a life sentence.  He was involved in tons of crimes that are going to stack up.  He purposely tried to hide who he was because he knew he was committing crimes.
In california a woman got 20 years in jail for stealing a package off a porch.  Why?  It was her third strike and she did it while she was still on probation from the last crime.
Crimes add up and normal people don't fall into these situations.  This isn't like Aaron Swartz where he was committing civil offenses and they were charging him with tons of vague computer criminal laws to end his life.
Ulbricht was committing tons of real crimes to profit off it.  Maybe if he was running a non-profit, that would be different, but he was running a crime network for personal profit, not some kind of sense of personal freedom.

An agent extorting him after the fact doesn't change the crimes he committed or the punishments he deserves.
The fact that those people are in jail is pretty good, cops generally get away with criminal acts.   They probably felt pressured to prosecute the cops due to the high profile nature of the case.

Because they only needed to prove enough to keep el chapo in prison until he dies.

You seem stupid.  The context is a van transporting people and goods during a curfew period where no one was supposed to be outside.
You don't get to reject the context and claim there wasn't any.  It is a fucking warzone, they are trying to keep everyone safe by not letting anyone move around at night.  Otherwise innocent people get murdered by gangs going around killing them.
@_date: 2019-04-12 07:44:42

It was a target violating curfew.  He called it in and got approval to fire from officers checking all intelligence.
It was a perfectly legal kill in a warzone.  Violate curfew, this is what happens.
These people were dumber than a box of rocks to think violating the curfew wasn't going to matter.
@_date: 2019-04-12 17:21:50


Again, they do not release random documents unrelated to a crime.  They release proof of a crime.  Also, whistleblower laws require going to proper authorities, not just dumping documents online.  The whistleblower laws in the US do not protect you if you give documents to press or post them online.  The proper way to do it is give the evidence to authorities and let them prosecute. Then FOIA the evidence to make it legally public.
If you don't do it properly, you damn well better hope the crime you uncovered is very serious and that public sentiment makes you unprosecutable.
@_date: 2019-04-12 07:50:01
No, I am saying you cannot just steal documents and dump them en mass without knowing what is in them.
He just released stolen documents without any idea what was in them.  That is not how journalists work.  They would read the material and only use the documents that demonstrate a crime.  They would not release documents unrelated to a crime.
@_date: 2019-04-11 19:12:29


lol, 'relevent' to something we already knew.  Great whistleblowing.
'Collateral Murder'  lol, the thing I mentioned already where people lie about what the helicopter video shows.
Again, you have nothing.  You just repeated the primary thing he released that was debunked by just watching the video he released. He released it without looking at it because it shows a soldiers following the rules of engagement exactly.  No deviation at all.

It is a real point though. You named the only two things anyone can find in this doc dump and both are meaningless.  The 'collateral murder' claims are proven wrong by just watching the video.
Disagreeing with the rules of engagement doesn't make anything they did a crime.  The rules are what they are right now and accepted by every nation in the west.
@_date: 2019-04-16 19:43:16
Except the recipient of your remittance wants to covert it to local currency to use it.  So you are limited by the amount of people in that local economy buying bitcoin.  Also if the foreign government started tracking these things to show up with tax bills and criminal charges, you would stop using bitcoin entirely.
@_date: 2019-04-12 07:47:39

@_date: 2019-04-11 18:38:40
Link to the crime then.  Because that helicopter video shows a perfectly executed military operation with all protocols being followed.  They didn't think anyone was going to scrutinize it and they followed the book exactly.  So many people lie about that video.
Even if a crime was in there, you cannot just release tons of unrelated documents with it.
Receiving and distributed stolen documents is also a crime in europe.

Sad?  The dude turned into a nut job secluded in an embassy for 7 years to avoid a shorter jail sentence for wholesale dumping secret documents that he didn't even know the contents of.  He gambled on something illegal being in there, but there wasn't.  That a stupid risk he knowingly took.

@_date: 2019-04-11 16:31:06
A guy gives you the law and you just make up baseless opinion that isn't a real point.
Like it or not he received stolen documents and plastered them online.  He cannot claim to be a whistleblower because he didn't read any of it and no crimes were found in the documents.  Whistleblowing also requires you go to authorities, not the public.  Authorities can then disseminate the evidence via their case and FOIA.
If someone in the US did this to a foreign country that we are friends with like a european one, they would be extradited for sure.  But if a country refused extradition, you could still bring a case against them in their home country anyways because stolen documents are a crime in any country.

This is why bitcoin will never work.  You need a system that preserves anonymity.  These sites are tracking coin with their smaller resources.  The US government is going to be tracking all wallets it wants to track.

That is pretty cute.  There is no such thing.  They are all the same damn scam.  All the coins that claim they have some dedicated use to boost their value are full of shit.  You cannot prop up a coin with a single specific niche business use case tied to it.  Either it is used as a mass currency or it is not.
Even when used as a currency, it has no stable value, so it can inflate or deflate despite being used for commerce.

But trump screws everything up with his overt racism, allowing these people to win in court.
Sancturary cities are not a thing, no city can enforce federal law.  A city that refuses to spend resources illegally holding people is not a "sancturary".  What should piss you off is that the republicans in power won't go into a church and arrest criminals because they back religion.

At the end of the day, prices only stay up if everyone holds.  If people bail out of bitcoin, prices will fall.

I have to buy bitcoin for friends when they need it for certain online stuff because signing up for a site and giving them everything they need to steal your identity over a once a year payment is silly.

Doesn't mean you don't align with them.  Funny how reality works.

Yes, they have physical uses in society and have value as long as people need the product.  No one needs bitcoin for anything, it has no floor.  There is no guaranteed demand built into a society.

Go on, keep wasting your coin.  Make it rain.

ETFs for the sp500 or other larger mutual funds.
Novetly ETFs to "support" a cause are all trash.
@_date: 2018-11-05 16:31:39
Nothing backs bitcoin.  The fact that you cannot accept that means you are a shill.
Bitcoin can drop a ton of value at any time.  There are too many large whales who can dump.  Hell, an exchange can dump.

Do you still have to give them every document they need to steal your identity to open an account?
Until the barrier of entry is the same as a traditional bank, regular people cannot use this stuff.
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:22:31
This KYC excuse is garbage.  Banks deal with way more money and don't hassle people for any proof of who they are.  You can input an SSN in the US via an online form and they will ask you 3 random questions from your credit report generally things anyone who knows you could get right as they usually deal with owning a car at a certain time or your address.  That is it.  No images of ids or images with you holding up a signed piece of paper. Banks don't care who you are, they want the sign up process to be easy so they get more customers.  They have decided the rate of fraud is low enough to not care about true validation.

Now if only I was willing to give a website all my private info, I may be able to collect this and convert it back into USD so that it could be spent.
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:24:15
Any exchange that lets him convert that much bitcoin to cash is going to charge high fees.
Also, if kraken lacks the cash, this is a fraud scheme.  They are most likely booting the largest accounts and trying to replace their holdings with lots of smaller accounts.  So that when they fuck over the users, they have less people motivated to sue.  Lots of people losing money in the hundreds probably means no one sues.  One person losing 300k means they are going to sue.
This is definitely a really bad sign and everyone with anything on this exchange needs to run.
@_date: 2019-01-11 03:03:36
That is great, but regular people cannot buy bitcoin.  No one is going to give up all their personal info to register on any website that sells it just to make a few donations.
@_date: 2018-11-29 05:23:04
You agree with them tho, that is what you keep talking about.
@_date: 2019-01-20 06:24:19
No central authority?  Then why do you have to disclose everything someone needs to commit identity fraud against you just to buy and transfer it?  Seems heavily government regulated.
Cash doesn't have these barriers for entry.  You can open a back account or a credit card online with less disclosures than an account to simply buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-05 01:42:46
Bitcoin has nothing backing it.  The price is arbitrary, it could be 1 usd or 10k usd.  It is price fluctuations that cause problems and hurt adoption.  Transitioning to bitcoin won't happen as long as it is volitile.
They are all scams, because they can all fall to zero at any time.  If they go up in value, only the few that cash out first get money, the rest lose.  It functions very close to a pyramid scheme because every dollar of value extracted by a winner comes from the pocket of a loser.

All the government ultimately wants to do is make it such a headache and risk no one wants to use it.  They are definitely succeeding.
If I touch bitcoin again, it will only be if I can keep it off the radar of the IRS.  Even with my trading from last year, thankfully 70 of my trades were on binance and not reported to the US government.  The 10 on gdax is what caused me the headache.  There is no reason to have to report every individual transaction, the end result will be the same if you take the amount you started with and compared that to the amount you ended up with based on the start and end of the calendar year vs adding and subtracting all the gains and losses of individual transactions.

Then give him his funds.  You are demanding information banks don't even ask for.

Yup, radicals like trump are taking over all around the world and we are getting this partisan violence as a result.

A bitcoin ATM only works for a small once a year purchase like a subscription to something.
The high fees make it unusable for daily commerce, but you already know that.  You are just being pigheaded on purpose.
Bitcoin fees from buying and selling it need to be cheaper than a credit card fee to be viable.  If you want to charge more, you need a feature like anonymity which it lacks.  The taxes are also ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:28:20
It is not related to anything. If he was under a criminal investigation, he wouldn't be allowed to buy bitcoin and extract the money that way.
Kraken clearly has money problems and is trying to spread out the losses by eliminating the larger account holders who would be much more motivated to sue.  They would rather have 300 people lose 1k each than one person lose 300k.  The latter will sue, the former won't find it worth it to sue.
@_date: 2018-11-05 12:12:31
lol, you cannot get bitcoin via magic.

Nearly all ETFs are trash and this is one of them.  They exist to exploit emotion to sap up fees from stupid people.

lol, bitcoin isn't helping in venezuela at all.
Also, look at greece and how they dealt with a government that fucked up when they couldn't print their own money. Another country had to offer them loans or they would have become venezuela.
The dollar is much stronger than a currency you do not control.

Except with that other stuff you have the commodity or ownership.  Those create floors and spur real demand for need.
A company that is functional can devalue only so much until someone wants to buy them.  A commodity can only get so cheap until people buy more or production decreases supply.
Bitcoin has nothing behind it.  No coin does.  That is why every scheme coin tries to link their coin to some kind of commerce as if that will guarantee some level of usage.  But that isn't the same thing because any consumer that is temporary doesn't care if the price is 1 dollar of 10k dollars, they hold it for short periods of time.  Technically it will always be the 'investors' buying coin propping it up for the commerce and the investors take the losses.

If you think he did, you are just a liar.  That makes you a republican and yes, libertarians are all republicans.
Libertarianism isn't real.  It is just a cover to avoid admitting you are a republican.

It is your standard lie, taxi drivers flat out hate taking credit card.  Most lie and claim their machine doesn't work.  To pay credit, you basically have to threaten to leave without paying if he doesn't take it.
It is sad that taxi drivers still do this stuff as uber and lyft takes all their business for reasons like this.
@_date: 2018-12-03 02:01:30


That is kinda sad.  They feel comfortable giving some random site enough info for some serious identity theft?
You can get an activated credit card instantly using a form that asks for less info.


Ask them if they would have given the same info to a foreign company.  Because they all ask for it now.
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:10:28
Nope, it is just too hard to use it.  There is no easy way to buy bitcon for a normal price.  Those ATMs have high fees, so at most they are used by people who want bitcoin anonymously for one off purchases.
No one is going to start using bitcoin if the only real way to get it is to sign up for a site that wants all your personal info and scans of your id.
@_date: 2018-12-17 02:25:46
You didn't listen to the audio.  The guy is saying they should have the instructions for you and then say you are on your own. He is not saying they need to fix it, just that they tell you how you can do it if you have control of the recipient wallet.
It is reasonable, because this is a company making tons of money off of coin, they should be able to fund the creation of help guides.
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:31:26

This isn't even possible.  Any encryption that works has no back door.

That would prevent them from generating more coin to fund debts.

It is pegged to their currency, meaning it is just as worthless.

Overstock is a bad example, they are dumping their store.  
Plus, recipients isn't the biggest issue, it is hard for normal people to buy crypto to use for payment.  You either pay a huge premium at a bitcoin ATM or give some website all the info they need to steal your identity just so you can link your bank account to them to buy crypto.
People need an easy way to buy crypto or it will never work.
