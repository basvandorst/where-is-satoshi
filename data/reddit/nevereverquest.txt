It really doesn't matter, what matters is Ulbricht's intent.  He had an opportunity to walk the high ground and he would have so much support if he had, but he didn't and he tried to kill people.

The problem with a mod log is that people will purposely spam content that they know will get filtered so they can point to the mod log and say "look, see how bad they are!".  It will do nothing to help and just give the people pushing FUD another tool to use to push more FUD.

I think you're going to discover that it's not that simple.  What the IRS is going to eventually see is your buys\sells\sends on coinbase.  It's not straight forward because they are going to look at first in\first out to determine your liability and that is very messy for some of us who have been sending coins to cold storage and spending.  You are going to eventually have to prove that you still own those cold storage versus what you have spent.  If I dump my transactions on coinbase and suck them into a tax program, it is a complete mess trying to figure out what is what.  I have bought coins for years on coinbase with hundreds of transactions to merchants and cold storage with only one sell.  The IRS will consider any send outside of coinbase as a sell if you can't prove you still control the coins.  We are all in for a world of hurt and the pain will be determined by how much you have used coinbase to buy\sell\send and how well you tracked all of that.
  
A tiny example of my current headache is that a lot of my early coins are in cold storage so from a first in\first out perspective, I owe capital gains on all that cold storage unless I prove I still own it and didn't spend it.  They will eventually know about those transactions and ask me for more information, this is inevitable.  Keeping my coins on coinbase and spending using shift just makes it even worse.
  
I've determined that the best thing I can do for myself going forward is to not let coins sit on coinbase.  As soon as they arrive, I have to send them so that there is no time for the price to mature while holding them on coinbase.  So later when the IRS looks at it, those coins will look like they were immediately spent and I won't have to worry about capital gains on them.  This is all gambling on the idea that I won't be audited and then stuck with the liability anyways or forced to prove my holdings, they will want receipts that I don't have.  Shit, I don't have receipts for most of my transactions.

You may not want to, but it might be your most convenient option.  I live in a rural area with a few close neighbors who want to use my wifi.  I've been having them contribute to the bill but would rather they paid for their usage using bitcoin.  If I set up this system, they would have to either pay using bitcoin or get their own internet connection.  There was an argument some months back when I was seeking their share of the bill and one of them had been traveling for the summer and didn't use the wifi, they didn't want to pay even though the agreement was that they pay every month.  This would put a stop to that kind of headache for me.

I wonder if the Satoshi rouse is to give him an excuse to start erasing his life and evidence.  If he knew the tax man was coming, he couldn't just start deleting everything because that would look like he is covering up evidence, but now he can claim he was being stalked by strangers on the internet and he felt he had to for his own safety.

There was no way to supply that market without violence and there is plenty of evidence that shows Ulbricht's intention to have people killed.  It doesn't matter if he succeeded or failed, what matters to most people is his intent. 
  
I know you just see what you want to see and I doubt you have actually looked at the evidence including all of the transcripts.  I've read them all and reviewed all evidence presented and there is very good evidence that Ross Ulbricht intended for people to die on multiple occasions.  At this point it doesn't matter if it's proven since he is doing the time and proving it won't keep him in prison for longer than his entire life.  The evidence is there for anyone who cares to look and make an objective decision.  There is nothing wrong with deciding on your own as long as you don't take the law into your own hands.

Just running a full node that's always on helps the network.  You could start by writing some simple scripts that get satoshis from 21.   You can set it to mine and you can also issue a command a few times a day to get some satoshis.  I would start a full node, enable mining and write a script to get as many satoshis from the system that you can.  Then look at what others have built and try and recreate it on your node.

Based on what I have seen, if it is a random 8 character password, it is very good.
  
The thing that turned me on to BIP38 was a submission here where someone posted a BIP38 wallet to an image site and invited everyone to try and crack it.  It only had a 4 character password and I don't think anyone was able to without help from the creator.

I love the change, please don't turn back on scores.  Now no opinions are being buried and I'm not having to expand a ton of comment threads to get the whole picture.  This is especially relevant on some of the more controversial topics.  In those threads, there was always one side that was better at burying the other.  Now I can just read everything and when I see a comment with a + now, I know that it is actually buried and I can choose to ignore it but I mostly don't and I can read through those comments without much effort and without moving around a bunch of other comments on the screen.
  
In the end the comments are still sorted the same and I can choose new to see what's coming in or best for my normal browsing method.  I find myself not using controversial with the new scoreless theme as much.
@_date: 2015-12-08 01:02:23


Fabricated or not, Ross Ulbricht paid that DEA agent to have people killed.  He intended for them to die.  And that is just one instance of him doing it when there were multiple instances of Ulbricht paying people to kill other people.  Good people just "running a website" don't try to have people killed.
@_date: 2015-12-10 18:14:19
 The sorting is also an indicator and is arrived at by score, so your complaint is really hollow given that what you seek is still there.
@_date: 2015-12-10 18:05:55
But your whole premise is a fallacy.  People vote for many reasons and not all of them reflect the legitimacy of an answer.  Shit, I've been downvoted for recommending BIP38 as a cold storage solution.  In that particular case Armory Wallet was heavily upvoted and my BIP38 recommendation was buried.  With the current system, they wouldn't have had to expand my comment to see the recommendation but it would have still been at the bottom.  I don't see the problem and I see more good than bad with the current system.
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:19:58
Thanks, I thought your question was reasonable too.  You even qualified it by mentioning recent events.   Only an idiot wouldn't know that given recent events dodging the question will just result in more questions, so I must assume she is doing it for the attention that she knows it will generate.  She isn't an idiot.  So basically she's using this to get attention instead of giving us an answer.  An answer that is certainly warranted given everything that has happened in the last few days.
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:51:53

They do!  But it doesn't show the whole picture.  The information they send can be completely wrong if you're sending coins to cold storage and you didn't actually realize any gains\loss but Coinbase and tax programs have no way to know that information unless you adjust it.  That's where the pain starts.
@_date: 2015-12-09 17:10:38
Won't that just confuse people?  
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:17:50
You have a habit of calling anything you don't understand a scam or NSA operation and your comments score is usually in the negatives as a result.  I was making an observation that even with the new scoring system, I still find your submissions where they usually are, at the bottom.  Is true.
