These threads are so lively. Almost 300 comments. Shows the enthusiasm for BTC. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 03:47:47
Going down to 7K levels for sure. Will it bounce again? Maybe but my guess it goes down to 5-6K. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 14:35:59
How old are you... guessing you are 12 or something. If comments from one person hurts bitcoin then it deserves it. If you actually believe in BTC then just keep holding and stop complaining.
@_date: 2019-03-29 17:31:18
Everyone is too bullish and too much belief that the bear market is over. I would not want to enter this market right now. Things will get dicey once it creeps to 4200. Until things really change, which I don’t think have, then you can bet on continued struggles. This is looking like a dump in the works. Fair warning. 
@_date: 2019-03-30 04:06:14
Bull market? Haven’t seen a new high myself. Hmmm
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:24:40
It’s another dip, until it’s not. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:21:02
Surprised it still this high. My guess is 2-3K by end of year. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:41:15
Just like the strong support everyone mentioned at 7K and 8K etc. 
Can’t wait for the 5K support comments
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:42:11
That’s the thing though, a lot of ppl don’t believe and just want to ride the speculative waves.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:26:14
Lol same was said if 6K, 5K, 4K, soon 3K
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:16:41
What ever happened to that bitcoin tip bot?
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:00:30
Let’s check back in a month then. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:03:47
Same was said of 5K, 6K, 7K... it easily went up and it can easily go back to near nothing 
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:17:50
Bags getting heavier each day. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:46:19
Moon cane and past my friend.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:16:36
Bounced from 6.6 to 7, not much of a bounce. Expect low volume through the weekend and then you’ll see it go down to 4-5K
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:07:25
Is water wet also?
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:31:07
Eventually there’ll be an ATH that won’t be reached again. Hmm wonder if that occurred already...
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:33:06
Doesn’t matter, I’m saying it today. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:42:03
Or maybe the bubble already popped. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 00:03:37
Don’t worry 2K will be here before you know it
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:29:49
Hmm totally never heard that sentiment about 5K, 6K, 7K...
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:34:55
I was saying these are small gains. Small bull win. 
Hit me up if it ever goes back to 12-14 range. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:01:02
And many months ago I was called a fool for saying it was going down to 4K
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:21:48
Bull hunting season? Yes
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:11:38
GG ��
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:41:46
The only ones not selling are the new comers who are in the red and early adopters who are playing with house money. The latter are starting to realize they are on a sinking ship and have been taking profits more and more. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:22:30
He also said crypto will end very badly for many!!
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:55:24
Who keeps buying these tiny pumps?
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:29:02
Don’t worry it’ll get cheaper. Just don’t expect to see an ATH ever again. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:54:16
Nope. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:10:20
You missed the “.” between the 1 and 2
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:10:51
Past performance blah blah duh dah. But anyways when it went to $200 there wasn’t as much exposure in the markets. Market makers are no longer the individual retail “investors”. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:56:51
No worries you will soon be entertained as it goes down some more. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:54:29
Guys, it’s just another healthy, slow crash. This has happened in the past and it always recovers to a new ATH. And we know that past performance is a true indicator of future successes. At least keep telling yourself that. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:27:16
Haha what?? Oh boy 
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:19:04
Stopped reading at fully manipulated. Do you think crypto isn’t?? ��
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:08:01
A year ago. 3 years ago. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:21:08
Lol I know some here are delusional but damn you’re on a diff level 
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:07:35
That’s all in the past. Also something that happened when the big boys were not even playing in the game. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:09:52
Going down to 4-5K then will have a bounce to 7-9K only to go back down to 1-2K. Will take time but this is a gradual bubble burst with a few bull traps. But keep buying that “dip”. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:22:01
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:02:38
Obviously not. Did you read what I wrote. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:04:05
Lol don’t put all your eggs into one basket. The basket here being crypto. Sure crypto can be the future, it could also fail. Stock market can fail (crash) too but we know it will eventually recover. We don’t know the same about crypto. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:46:09
This sentiment is the exact reason this whole bitcoin thing could go down in flames. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 23:47:03
Looks like you may have been wrong and it’s heading straight down to 4K
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:28:57
Don’t worry won’t go below 3K. Just like everyone said it wouldn’t go below 6K
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:25:02
Small rise? Just went down about 1K in last 24hrs. Then followed by a 200 rise. Look at the long term trend. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:12:46
Pray to bitcoin Jesus lol
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:24:19
Either weak hands or smarter hands. Let’s see how it plays out  
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:44:53
I’m calling it, 6K by end of April 
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:13:42
Bitcoin already popped. Did you expect for it to hit $100 overnight?
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:45:05
When something is overvalued it looses a lot of value from not so good of news and doesn’t gain much value on really “good” news. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:51:47
So many bull traps down the bursting road ��
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:57:15
Well they’re a bunch of fools.
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:53:05
Don’t try to day trade! Or even swing trade! You will win some but probably lose more!! If you want to ride, pick what you think is a good entry point. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:08:36
I’m way more likely to be right than wrong. You’ll see. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:46:22
Cue in the, “I’ll love to buy me some bitcoin on the cheap”. ��
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:46:20
Balls of steel or more likely very delusional. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:40:10
Don’t worry, you’ll get more “dip” opportunities 
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:18:07
Don’t expect a bounce of 6K. Probably heading to 4-5K
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:08:17
Median hose hold savings is seeping 11K and 30% have less than $1K. Speak for yourself saying 1K on crypto is affordable 
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:06:54
Ok gotcha ��
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:31:09
I would, 99 arguments actually. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:52:59
Where moon?? Will be back to 7K by EOW. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:21:16
Goes up $100 and you think it’s a breakout...
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:47:51
Wishful thinking
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:25:51
“poor man”
Clean af wrap
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:36:36
Lost All Money Being Obtuse?? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:38:52
My guess, goes back to 8K bounces back to 9K only to see 5-6K. SMH
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:40:39
Haha knew this would be here
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:52:16
See you at 5K. Keep buying that “dip” lol
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:22:57
Not possible but inevitable. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:33:00
For sure. The lucky gamblers will keep making money on the remaining bull traps. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:27:45
The only legit fork is BCH
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:01:09
Sarcasm I hope. Otherwise you are beyond delusional. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:09:31
Think you need to flip bear and bull and your sentence makes more sense. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 05:07:53
Well there are many that truly believe in bitcoin and don’t see it as just an investment. Then there are those that just see potential of getting better returns compared to the stock market. Not sure where I find myself just yet. 
You are right to be skeptical and who knows Ether could be the winner, could be LTC, NEO or something not created yet. Or there is no winner and it’ll all be a loss. 
Sure anyone can make a crypto currency just as anyone can make a company. Just have to know which companies have good value. 
It very well could be a dot com bubble, which may prove to be worse actually. 
End of the day you should be careful and don’t risk what you wouldn’t be ok with losing. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:55:48
Past sentiments: there’s a huge wall at 13, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6... ok sure
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:07:46
I know ��
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:36:25
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:54:28
5.9 in the next week. Probably today. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:36:06
RIP 
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:58:15
Exactly! bcore is getting harder and harder to explain. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:41:47
Can you explain the trade? What’s your break even price?
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:38:41
Bull run? You mean the artificial pump?
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:18:30
Back to bear territory? Bull run ended months ago. Don’t let the pumps fake you out. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:00:51
It was but a nice little pump back to the bottom she goes. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:08:46
A mil or close to zero. Not going to be close to a mil. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:07:02
That Bart Simpson trend line is forming pretty well. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:00:37
Once the bear market ends we will see one coin rise to greater adoption and no it won’t be BTC
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:06:00
Going down to 4-5K, will see a bounce back to around 7K but it’s all downhill from there. It’s been a downhill drive since ATH but they still buy the “dip”.
