Regulation and licensing help with the fiat &amp; centralized side of trading bitcoins, but do nothing with respect to the value of the Bitcoin, which requires trust, faith (belief) and cultural sentiment. This trust is continually and gradually being eroded by the push towards making bitcoins the medium of exchange for fiat, rather than the other way around. If people keep respecting the fiat dollar and the fiat economy, then it tends to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The small community of fervent Bitcoiners cannot do much to change this attitude. In fact, it may take at least another decade for real change, as we wait for the children who grow up with this technology to become the thought leaders of tomorrow - but only if they can break free from the debt slavery that is forced upon the current generation. It is not possible to break free from the debt slavery when it is reinforced by the laws, regulations and the status quo of the dominant authority and paradigm.

It is important that Bitcoin be made available as an option, and that it is not forced onto people like a threat of enslavement in a closed system. It needs to be an option, opt-in system where people who believe in it can trade with one another.
There is an old myth long ago, in which people who dared to venture outside in the open wilderness are seen as outcasts (rejects) - or mad (possessed by demons). The people who lived with the comforts of the cathedral started to believe that it was *dangerous* to venture outside into the open wilderness, and this fear formed the terms of their enslavement by the lords of the cathedral. It seems that this is not such an old myth in the modern era with our smartphones and our ability to travel great distances. Our minds are still instinctively locked in cathedral mode.
However, with each impending Global Financial Crisis, the need to stay within the confines of the cathedral is tested, and found wanting.

The concept of opening up trade using open protocols of exchange is simple.
Access to the banking network is exclusive and privileged, and many people in the global community are not permitted to participate in a protected (or over-protective) network.
The opportunity with cryptocurrencies is that the barrier of entry is considerably lowered, because open protocols allow innovation at the fringes (which imply participation by people who cannot gain access to the exclusive banking network).
The cryptocurrency economy represents an inclusive but fringe/alternative network, and what Andreas Antonopoulos calls a festival of the commons (a reversal of the tragedy of the commons).
Opening up trade should be about promoting inclusion, not about over-protective Crony Capitalism.

Bitcoin, blockchain and the network effect that makes Bitcoin currently the only reliable medium of exchange - are the jargon terms in this industry that mean the same thing as "distributed ledger technology".
Any other "distributed ledger technology" that is not Bitcoin is just an altcoin or leveraging off the brand of Bitcoin.
Any other "distributed ledger technology" that is a closed protocol and does not interoperate with other systems outside of their control, do not benefit customers. Centralized systems have limited use, because closed systems, by their nature, are fragile. Banking systems were never designed to change much. They used to rely on mainframes and COBOL.

I suppose that it is fair to be distrustful of government regulations &amp; the increasing invasion of privacy. That Big Brother imposes forceful surveillance over all participants with extreme prejudice of persons deemed undesirable or outcasts, with the law on their side to do what they will - typically to freeze/deny withdrawals, which would seriously inconvenience consumers. Regulation always makes it harder for consumers and merchants, however, the it is where the industry is heading to gain mainstream acceptance.
I would have to admit that the current way of having to scan government ID is very consumer-unfriendly. There should be an easier way of doing this without appearing like a forceful invasion of privacy.

Basically, what it is, is an immutable, decentralized database, propagated by P2P.
Smart devices will benefit from adopting open protocols, which will allow communication and exchange of data among disparate devices not manufactured by the same company. So the protocol must be device-agnostic, politically-neutral. This is not even a new concept - The idea has been around since the dotcom boom, but the vision never materialized fully, because there had never been a way to incentivize the network. (Bitcoin is the reason that the blockchain network exists and can exist.)
With blockchain/bitcoin protocol+platform+network, it seems that there is enough growing network effect to build the Internet of Things on. As more developers make the platform more viable and usable and attracts the biggest market share, then it will attract even more developers to choose this platform.

Sure, there is only one Blockchain, just like when we refer to the Sun, we mean the sun in our solar system. When we refer to the Internet, we mean the internet that the global community can access. You can also have private internets, private facebooks, etc. Like for example, North Korea has their own private internet, and their population is blocked from the Internet. That is why there will also co-exist many private blockchains. In time, this will be the norm and ordinary people will be oblivious to the workings. They will think that it is all the same thing, even though they are not.

Bitcoin is an attempt to create a system that can account for everything, and hold that accountability immutable. That has implications.
All current systems of payment that aren't immutable, risk loss of funds at an indefinite point when the system becomes unsupported. (e.g. bus transport cards, photocopying cards)
A decentralised global ledger is the best way to ensure continual support.

Bitcoin represents an open, decentralized trust network that also happens to use cryptography (particularly SHA256 for hashing).
3 words are key to the technology.
(1) Open: It is the opposite of closed or proprietary. Being open helps people globally innovate more rapidly. Closed platforms stifle innovation.
(2) Decentralization: There is no central authority that controls what happens, so Bitcoin cannot be shut down, just like the Internet cannot be shut down. If the Internet is shut down, due to depletion of energy, then the world no longer has to worry about Bitcoin. The implementation of decentralization is through Peer to Peer (P2P) technology.
(3) Trust: Money depends on trust, without which money cannot have meaning or hold value. When trust is ensured, then exchange of funds can happen. The way Bitcoin ensures trust is by implementing a mining system called "Proof of Work" (PoW). Arguably, the exponential increase of computing (hashing) power over time helps to secure the network. Though it seems like it could never work, the existence of the network after 5 years is evidence that the method works and it seems to be a valid solution to the Byzantine General's Problem.
There is more to bitcoin than the currency, but to get started with bitcoin, you must first create a wallet, and either: join an exchange and convert fiat currency to bitcoin, or: request to be paid for your work in bitcoin.

As with any new way of saving money, consumer adoption will be slow, and there might be initial consumer resistance. Early adopters will yet again be the tech-saavy among us (e.g. myself) who actually bother to research the technology and current potential developments in 2015, as well as the price trend. It appears that there is going to be a bearish price trend for some time yet, which could potentially push the price even lower.
2014 has been a significant year for the Bitcoin space. In summary, mainstream adoption cannot happen without clarity from regulators, as to its legitimacy. -- If in name only, a title such as bitLicense would provide a basis for large business to build on, even though this supports centralization.
Even though the ideas behind Bitcoin are libertarian and anarchistic, in 2014, we learn that mainstream adoption lies somewhere in between having to compromise with traditional institutions and the cartels. At some point, the cartels will also exploit rather than shun the technology, because it is open, non-proprietary, free, like air.
Regarding VC funding, there are more worthwhile investment ideas than holding/hoarding bitcoin as a speculative asset -- In 2014, there was investment into remittances, multisig (escrow) for legal property rights, programmable currency, or any of the FinTech that are currently not available.
In 2014, Bitcoin shall be known as that which is progressing FinTech forward, and a lot of this will not come into fruition until two more years at least.
In 2013-2014, we also saw one of the most speculative bubbles crash caused by bad practices at Mt Gox and the bitcoin price is still going through a price correction and price discovery.
What we need in the future to spur consumer adoption: cheap physical card wallets that are custom made for mobile phones with sensor technology that sense your proximity. This is to give people something physical to touch. People also need to know how money is backed by something, when it is not backed by banking. This requires a lot of education and the willingness to view things differently. It requires understanding what happens when they bail out a bank.

This is a brilliant address, even evoking the likes of Gutenberg. Andreas sets up the concept of evolution rather than revolution, and highlights historical changes that improve expression. Even the phrase to coin a word means to create a term of expression. Given the fact that money is an expression, he describes how Bitcoin separates the message from the medium (vehicle, transport or instrument), and wrestles control of the medium from the traditional gatekeepers - making the transport open to trivial usage. At first, the gatekeepers will undermine the nascent technology by marketing perceived value and trust in the traditional medium, and sneer at the trivial usage of the nascent technology. But it is the trivial usage that give the medium the full range of expression, which makes Bitcoin the superior expression (content type) of money.
He makes the case that it is actually the content and not the medium that gives the message its quality, and it is an archaic notion to over-laden the medium (with say, over-protection, which weighs down the message).

You may not have heard it before but “Why should anyone want to save money?”
It is precisely the problem of consumption and over-zealous spending in the global debt-based machinery, which led to the economic crisis that can be regarded as a house of cards.
In contradiction, we are also encouraged to save money, rather than spend it. If everyone were to stop spending altogether in a debt-based economy, the economy would seize up and die. It is a very strange dance between extremes. By the nature of debt and inflation, compared to earlier generations, it seems that we can afford even less than our previous generations. We are passing debt onto future generations, so younger people and those yet unborn will be able to afford less, and be ever more in debt, which is a bleak future.
Enter Bitcoin, which is part philosophy, part implementation of technology, part currency, etc.
The philosophy part concerns decentralization: separation of politics from money. Why is the state an oligarchy and not a democracy? Why is there an increasing divide between the very rich and the working class? Why is debt increasing, and governments can only make the problem worse by pressuring the poor, whereas the rich have tax concessions? Why do they have laws that target and punish the individual severely, but when it comes to a corporation, the liabilities of responsible individuals are insured, minimizing risk? Why does an Apple product cost twice as much in Australia than in the USA? Bitcoin philosophy intends to provide a more egalitarian and fair system for people.
Nevertheless, the mainstream probably ignore or gloss over the philosophy part, and primarily get into bitcoin because of the penny stock concept, which is based on speculative investment. If people still treat bitcoin as money that has exchange value relative to fiat (sovereign) currency, then to many people, it is still virtual currency. It can only become real money when people do not need exchanges anymore in order to use money. Conversion/exchanging adds friction, cost, intermediary/custodial access to your finances.
Overall, though, the next decade will prove to be a very exciting time indeed for “Bitcoiners” (That is what I am calling myself), particularly with new releases of Bitcoin-related technologies, and mass adoption by people from remote parts of the world.

Bitcoin is not meant to be used as a stock, but yes, the stock experienced in significant drop in 2014 with more new users entering the space.
Bitcoin is not meant to be a stock, because it is supposed to be used as a currency. At the moment, not many are using it as a currency, because of regulation. Tax office wants to treat it as a stock. This is more or less preventing people from using it more freely as a currency.
It's a catch-22 situation.
Once Bitcoin is used as a currency, then the stock value should increase, because its stock value lie in its usage.
Some might argue that there is intrinsic value in Blockchain, the technology and platform. However, I argue that technology is useless if it does not get used by the market. It is the currency of the applications that give the technology its worth and its stock value.

I see the Ledger Wallet as worth it, as it is not only just for bitcoins. It has the potential to secure features beyond the currency. (Most people think that a Bitcoin Wallet is only for holding the currency, but there are other ways to use keys. I think that most Bitcoin Wallets at the moment are somewhat closed in that they are only about money. For example, the Case Wallet appears to be a closed, self-contained hardware unit that you definitely cannot use it for anything other than its intended use. Ledger makes it more open for other developers to create other types of apps that can use keys.)
The decentralized applications built on the foundations of Bitcoin will be the “killer app” in the future.

I don't think that it should be considered a virtual commodity, though, because bitcoins are merely a monetization instrument, a unit of account, i.e. numbers written to a general ledger.
When you have some bitcoins, you don't actually have "bitcoins" - You have some numbers written to a general ledger, over a decentralized network. It is just math. Over time, the network will confirm those numbers with more proof and certainty, hence the terms "confirmations" and "proof of work".
The confusion is that people think that "bitcoins" are a virtual commodity, and that acquiring or selling them is a taxable event.
What if, in an ideal world, every time you have to do math, it is a taxable event?
e.g. if you have to work out what 56 multipled by 2 equals? It is a taxable event.

Bitcoin started as an academic paper posted on a crypto website, then an implementation was released - i.e. work that other people can test and assess. The first app has a very niche audience (e.g. maths genuises).
Now, Bitcoin has grown even bigger, and there are various industry providers designing for various niches. What app you may choose to test depends on which niche you identify with.

One of the fallacies that the critics have is that they like the blockchain technology but they prefer to let only the banks control and use it. That doesn't solve the problem of trust, because the banks cannot be trusted. The banks were the ones who have failed us, time and time again.

Addressing the two flaws that economists always seem to want addressed:
(1) why buy something today if it will be cheaper tomorrow? (Deflationary impact on industry)
*Answer:* Improve competition and need. If a person needs to consume food, then he/she will have to spend money to buy food. If a person really needs to buy something, then he/she will have to buy something to use. If a person does not need to buy something, then he/she should not have to buy something that is not needed, but the industry expects people to buy things anyway, for no reason.
TLDR: Stop forcing people to buy things that they do not need. Encourage people to save money, otherwise only debt will win. Stop increasing the prices of goods and services, because doing so will only increase the tax on goods and services.
(2) Divide between aristocracy and poor.
*Answer:* The situation currently exists in society with or without bitcoin. The problem was created by fiat currency, central banking, and parasitic, rent-seeking behaviour. You are not going to see any solution to this issue, until the global financial system collapses.

One way to acquire some coins is to sign up (an account) as a trader at a money services business (e.g. exchange), which requires complying with AML (anti-money laundering) and KYC (know your customer) rules.
Using a trading system is a bit like using eBay. Think of the token as an electronic commodity that is being traded for fiat.
A lot of these services are central systems. It is not wise to leave money with a lot of other people on central systems, because central systems can become a target for hackers, or, like Mt Gox, they could be operating some kind of fractional reserve system. Essentially, central services operate similarly to banks, so you can experience the same disadvantages as the banking system.
The next step is to create a "bitcoin wallet". (This is a way of storing your private keys, away from central systems. Essentially, it is the equivalent of hiding money under your bed.) I recommend a hardware implementation like Ledger Wallet, which makes the process of backing up your money easy to follow.
Because the promise of Bitcoin is in decentralization, the best way to understand it is to create a bitcoin wallet and secure your private keys. The next step to bitcoin adoption is to get communities to trade peer-to-peer, to remove fiat from the ecosystem. We are not there yet, because payment methods using fiat and cards are too advanced and convenient, whereas paying by bitcoin still involves a lot of hassle. Unless people are able to trade peer-to-peer, bitcoin is still functioning like just another fiat, albeit not even as good.
The ideal definition of bitcoin is that fiat currency is "government money" whereas bitcoin is "private money", and that private money can co-exist in harmony with government money and regulation.
People have got to want the change to happen, otherwise we will still be stuck with trading bitcoin as a speculative asset, and that is not good.

Bitcoin is definitely a new field of its own (cryptography and peer-to-peer messenging protocol), separate from computer science. It seems to stem from distributed and mobile computing (computing sc) and federated databases (data management). At the heart of it, Bitcoin asks the fundamental question, *What is money?* and *Where does money come from?* It posits that the current problem of money lies in the tight coupling of money with politics (forming an *oligarchy*) and suggests the obvious computing science solution, which is to decouple money from politics. (In computing science and programming, it is known that tight coupling creates *brittleness* and it is a computing science problem.) This requires a *decentralized system of trust*, or a decentralized network. The practical implementation of it in C++ was very geeky, intellectual exercise. At the time (2008), none of this was new except the implementation of Proof-of-Work to ensure trust (which presented a new paradigm, like trying to solve multiple problems by casting one stone).

I recommend the Ledger Wallet. The customer support is good, and the development team has plans for more features. Ledger is a good company. There is so much that can be done in this space. I can barely control myself. At the moment, there are only 2 apps in the Ledger Wallet settings. Think of the potential and the future possibilities, when you compare to something like Google's play store, or Apple's App Store. It is one of the reasons why Ledger Wallet has made available an API. Third party integration.
Ledger Wallet can also be used in conjunction with a web wallet to enable multi-sig functionality.
Blockchain.info is good, but it feels like it is two years behind, and they haven't announced any future development plans or features to bring it up to speed with the rest of the community. However, they do provide a coin-joining (coin mixing) feature called Shared Coin.

At a glance, from the very first draft chapter of the book, I can already tell that it is very oriented towards programming, and you will need an analytic (maths-oriented) mind. From my experience in programming, this could be very time consuming, because time in a computing science course is like a ball of string. There is no end to how much time you can take! Some discipline is required to sort out time priorities.
From my experience with MOOCs in general, I think (and I am guessing) that this course will be assessed by peers, rather than by the teachers. This is because the homework exercises are challenging and not multiple-choice.
If you want to enter the latest field in cryptocurrency programming, and you have the time, then this is certainly the course for you!

I found out that Bit-x make it very hard to withdraw. Withdrawals incur a 0.5% commission, which is taken out from the remaining balance in the account, meaning you have to do maths and make sure there is enough balance.

If you are under 18 years of age, you are not authorized to use the Xapo Services, with or without registering.
ChangeTip also has this clause in their terms &amp; conditions:
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
Note, however, this just means that your kids cannot use hosted web wallets. Because of regulation compliance, the web host will prohibit any child under some “legal age” from using their money services.

Those who fall into the latter category are perfectly happy with the encumbered monetary system and see no reason to switch to a new way of transaction.

What you will find is that for PoS implementation to be successful, it needs to handle:
* many fast transactions (which is why PayWave/NFC is cool)
* refunds (preferably immediate refunds‡)
* add a step to prevent user error (typing in the wrong amount)
From what I gather, it will have to be implemented as a separate application layer, possibly centralized.
‡ There is a caveat with Bitcoin Debit Cards: refunds will take 45 days. I am still waiting and I will review. Bitcoin Debit Cards are not a good solution, but simply an interim concept.

It is obvious that Bitcoin Core is not achieving its objectives in forwarding technology, and therefore it is obsolete and should be superceded by a newer system that can promote more rapid innovations and changes. It seems to me that Bitcoin Core has become stale and stagnant, and resistant to change. It is crucial that for an emergent technology to grow, the community needs to foster ways to provide some space for new ideas to take shape and grow. I don’t see why the Bitcoin developer group is having such a hard time in achieving this.
The real change in BitcoinXT is not the technology, but the opportunity to break the stalemate from making changes to the technology. In a sense, this is more about creating a more open system for adopting changes.

Taxation is part of the debt-based money system. Bitcoin is not debt-based, and it is meant for a future-conceived, ideal Robocop-like world where government is no longer required to collect taxes, because their services would become reduced, made redundant by technology, and replaced by privatization (different for-profit organizations that can actually boost the economy instead of politicians’ pay packets).
At this time, people think that they can actually tax bitcoin use, even though the number of bitcoins are finite (21 million bitcoins). What they are actually collecting are fiat currency amounts at the on- and off-ramps, not bitcoins.

We have generally assumed immutability in our records, as stability will inspire confidence in using a product or service.
The argument put forward by the Bitcoin/Blockchain adherents is that, throughout history, history is written by the victors and those in power. People who have power and control the structures of money will always seek to change public records so as to alter future generations’ interpretation of history. Decentralized distributed database is a means to protect history from being erased (rewritten) by people in power. This all came about due to the issue of trust, when the banking system and governments failed us, and it is becoming more and more apparent that the failure is systemic and progressive.

I never buy gift cards at all. Why buy a product of questionable, mutable value? Especially so, it is stupid to exchange Bitcoin, which has immutable and far greater value, for promissory vouchers that can disappear their value. 
Buying gift cards is like buying bank notes, coins or gold bars with bitcoins. You cannot be sure whether the bank notes, coins or gold bars are real or counterfeit. Counterfeits are getting more sophisticated now. The best way to avoid being scammed is to only buy actual goods and services that you are going to use immediately, so that you can derive immediate benefit from usage of the good and/or service.

The danger is not in centralisation, but in the tendency towards the same monopolistic, anticompetitive nature of today's multinational corporations. We should distinguish these two concepts. The former is about architecture, infrastructure and computing. The latter is about geopolitics, regulation, control, and monopoly (cathedral, walled gardens, territorial enforcement) - the disempowerment of people in the lower tier social classes. If you mix these two concepts instead of separating them, then, of course, you might perceive central institutions to be sinister and of corrupt power, but the truth is not white and black.
Bitcoin is made up of open protocols like the Internet, so in this regard, it will always be made up of open protocols regardless of the implementation / infrastructure, etc. It will always require consensus by everyone, which makes it a democratic process.

Central Banking is the biggest Ponzi Scheme, though. Debt accumulates, and there is absolutely no way to pay debt. Debt can only be managed in the form of raising debt limits indefinitely, based on no certain terms. Unfortunately, there is an elitist minority who rely on this pyramid scheme which benefits those within the banking/political circles. They justify this by postulating a top-down pyramid hypothesis, i.e. money will flow down from the top.
The alternative way of thinking is bottom-up. Wealth is to be generated from the people, and actual labour. This wealth can then gradually move upwards towards those who are not productive in society, i.e. the bankers.

It involves playing by their rules, which is all the more reason for keeping your money out of the banks, and out of the banking system.

You could buy some BTC, then immediately move the funds into one of the hedged accounts on BitReserve. In effect, this pegs the value of your money to a more stable currency, and you would only be using Bitcoin as a medium of exchange to transfer funds into a hedged account to preserve its value for the future. You will need to verify your BitReserve account (photo, passport) to avoid paying fees.
Take care, and also take care of your money.

I have only been using them for a few weeks, since the start of this promotion. I haven’t tried withdrawals yet, as I intend to leave the funds with them until the end of November, then withdraw all of it. I had intended to take advantage of the promotion. (Four more months to go.) I think that the risk of being Goxxed/hacked/defrauded is minimal, though there can be no way to be sure, given the industry’s track record of fraudsters in 2015 alone. The site has a no-frills interface, which I like. Interest is paid out monthly. It is only a measly amount, but it is higher than the dust payments from faucets &amp; changetips.
I don’t know what Magnr intends to do with the site beyond December 8.
Note, however, that I am also using HaoBTC, the Chinese bitcoin miner, which is even riskier and more flakey than Magnr.

There isn't a pro.
Blockchain is not supposed to be a novelty tech, but the notion of money as being a shared ledger, which has always been in the past, up until recent times when the responsibility of holding the ledger was seized by people in power - central authorities.
Today, money still is a shared ledger, only that in order to gain access to your money, you would have to go through central authorities. Bitcoin challenges that structure, by creating its own private network - The Blockchain - where individuals can transact privately, by owning their private keys. Hence, bitcoins may be regarded as private money.
When you do not own your private keys, there are several things that central authorities can do:
(1) They can seize (or freeze) your money;
(2) They can charge fees and taxes on your money;
(3) They can make laws that make it illegal for you to possess money;
(4) They can devalue your money over time, with inflation of some goods and services, but mainly it is because of the real estate bubble and the education bubble. Commodity prices have crashed this year, though.
(5) They can operate freely as a Ponzi Scheme, happily allowing you to withdraw money, even though the bank accounts have been hacked and emptied, or the governments have bankrupted themselves paying for the cost of wars.

So basically, the first phase, based on the ideal of decentralization, is a pipedream.
The next phase is the corporate phase, where new players want to introduce federated databases (private blockchains), legitimacy (regulation) and remove volatility from the token.

@_date: 2015-04-30 07:01:03
They took the Bitcoin brand, and then they made it centralized, instead of decentralized.
Loyalists to the Bitcoin subculture see this as an attack to the heart of Bitcoin, which destabilizes its value as a decentralized platform, which is why the market value is dropping (given the fact that the majority of the market is made up of people who support decentralization).
It is hard to see where it is going, but the market price will have to go down before it can go up. As long as they make it more centralized, the market value will keep going down.

It is very easy. At checkout, you select the bitcoin option, then the vendor will create an invoice or order page with a scannable QR code which is the payee/biller bitcoin address. As soon as you submit the payment to that bitcoin address (a string of characters), the payment gateway page will instantly recognize (i.e. beep) that payment has been submitted/processed, even though the payment has yet to be confirmed. (It might take over an hour to confirm, and you could check its progress *by yourself* on blockchain.info.)
To keep track of who you paid, you could attach a short message to each transaction in your bitcoin wallet.

It is a type of money that you hold instead of letting a bank hold. When you let a bank hold your money, the bank lends out your money through fractional lending, which is why the fiat system requires a lender of last resort, in case of bank runs. Withdrawing your money from banks mitigates the risk of the banks losing your money. Bitcoin eliminates counterparty risk. Bitcoin avoids the necessity of a lender of last resort.

Bitcoin does not necessarily have to rely on electronics. Transactions could conceivably be conveyed through smoke signals if need be. It is a free, open-source messaging protocol.
The problem today is that international trade is being constrained by the politics of nation states. Exports and imports and people's skills and experiences are being impacted by the volatility of currencies and politics. Bitcoin lays an uncorrupted infrastructure sans the politics. Before Bitcoin can become beneficial trans-nationally, nations need to find a common ground and resolve their differences, about who is more elite and who should be poorer and excluded from wealth. Having sovereign power and high and mighty does not give them the right to dictate terms, although most people are all to ready to submit to those who take that iron throne of kings.

Intrinsic value means that there is something physically tangible and reusable in a thing. For example, you could theoretically fashion a cup out of gold and reuse it to drink tea with.
However, I think that the best form of money should be virtual and not physically tangible, otherwise people could just take a thing and repurpose it for fashioning a cup to drink tea with, and, if too many people make cups out of money, instead of using it as money, then it is not a good form of money.

The current mantra is, “buy what you can afford to lose.”
I follow the long-term strategy of HODL. (ROI: unknown; timeframe: unknown - It could take 1 year, 3 years, or 15 years; no one knows for sure. As such, if you are only buying and hodling, then it cannot be called investing.)
My theory of life is, that if the ecosystem develops, through various use cases (e.g. Ethereum, et al.) that add value to the Block Chain, then the Bitcoin will never go away. (The Block Chain is the construct that uses the Bitcoin as a monetary unit; the Bitcoin itself is meaningless without the Block Chain, and vice versa.) And, if the Bitcoin never goes away, then it will eventually mature, and the “investment” will pay off, i.e. be realized as an investment.
