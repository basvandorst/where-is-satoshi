They asked for a temporary fix to be subsidised by the community without any effort or development on their part. A selfish and unlikely to be conceded request obviously, but they had nothing to lose in trying to make it happen. 
Right now they're (allegedly) dragging their feet because everyone else (allegedly) is too. Once one big exchange implements segwit it'll put pressure on the other ones to do so as well.

That's true, it is 100% within their rights to ban him, I don't think anyone here is arguing with that.
We're talking about social media sites that generally anyone can use without filter and a lot of people do, sites with disparate yet concrete ToS. Now several of those sites, banned and delete quasi-simultaneously all content from a certain politically charged personality, using subjective reasons and over-reaching their declared ToS to justify denying him a platform most anyone gets access to. Whether it's legal or not and whether you like it or not, it is literally censorship.

Afaik the only other coin with a LN-like protocol in the works is ethereum. Bcash and ripple have nothing of the sort.
Ripple is a privately owned protocol and centralised by design, allowing transactions to be as fast and as cheap as their 
Bcash runs the exact same protocol as bitcoin but with the block size limit set to a higher value, which allows it (in theory) to include more transactions per block than bitcoin, but also increases the cost of running a full node and makes block propagation slower (increases centralization and decreases security). Regardless of capacity, blocks still take on average 10 minutes to be found, so the only difference would be in the fees and not the speed.

If a bunch of disparate websites each with its own set of rules of conduct quasi-simultaneously ban you from their services &amp; delete all your content, they are *literally* colluding to censor you. 
Whether or not you believe it is morally righteous or within their rights is irrelevant to the fact that it is censorship.

One user here asked


They never did such thing.
It was fairly obvious, from the questionable development decisions to the favouring of vague virtue signalling instead of actually addressing raised issues, that neither Garzik nor any of the major NYA players had ever ANY intention what-so-ever of seriously going ahead with the s2x fork.
It was always a speculative play and the 'cancellation' was obviously planned from the start.
Still, since it can't be proved that Garzik &amp; buddies (Erik Voorhees, Vinny Lingham, etc) are in fact competent scammers that conned the entire community, then they deserve to be forever known as the arrogant Hacky McHacks that spearheaded a fork movement with questionable &amp; untested code whilst refusing to acknowledge serious concerns raised by the community.

I'd like to see those.
Assuming the the average transaction size 7 years ago was 300 bytes, then you could fit around 3333 transactions per block back then. Nowadays the daily transaction volume is 1000x higher, so for starters let's assume we need to fit 1000x more transactions per block for the network to work just as well: With the average transaction size at 0.45kb, we'd need a blocksize of (1000*3333*0.450kb)=1,499,850KB, or 1.5GB.
Let's be conservative and estimate we only need to fit 100x more transactions per block now for the network to work just as well, even then it's still 150MB per block, at over 100 blocks mined per day the blockchain would still be growing at a rate of more than 500GB per month. And as the network keeps growing things only get worse.
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:43:27
So your argument against segwit is a text from Satoshi 9 years ago about bitcoin scaling automatically... written before he created the block size limit himself, and also before there were chinese warehouses full of ASIC miners. 
Segwit effectively increases the available block space for transactions while at the same time removes the possibility of transaction malleability &amp; the use of ASIC boost. It doesn't preclude the option of increasing the block size even more down the read either. So the fact is it literally makes no sense to be pro increasing block size but against segwit, unless you're against taking tx malleability and ASIC boost out of the game (and no those things weren't [envisioned by Satoshi]™).
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:23:52
The problem is now solved. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:38:19
The thing is increasing blocksize is not a long term scaling solution, pretty much every dev and technical person in the cryptosphere agrees on that. ETH and XMR, for example, have dynamic block sizes (i.e. block size increases if the current mined blocks are fully filled, and vice-versa) and even their devs admit the currencies are not ready for large scaling as they are right now.
Then you have a small group within the cryptosphere, specifically within the bitcoin space, a movement lead by two guys that haven't ever developed anything (blockchain related or otherwise), arguing that all those devs are wrong and increasing block size is indeed the only solution bitcoin needs. They even argue for untested &amp; convoluted mechanisms of block size selection (the so called "emergent consensus") instead of the simple and mathematically-sound dynamic block size scaling some altcoins have. If you read their words you can see they never give a logical or technical argument for their position, just vague and emotionally charged words every time: we're supposed to believe they're right because their solution is "as per satoshi's vision™", segwit and everything core is part of an evil conspiracy because some devs work for blockstream, etc.
I get what you're saying about people tending to simplify everything as "us vs them", and of course it's inevitable for it to happen in this situation too. But the  position of the BU guys is at the very least ignorant as it's at odds with the opinion of the actual experts, worst case scenario it's downright malicious (as the ASIC exploit scandal seems to imply).

@_date: 2017-05-31 11:01:04
Satoshi hasn't been around since 2010 and the daily number of transactions back then was literally less than 0.1% of what we have today. On top of that, Moore's Law, which was a central piece for any scaling estimations, has been recently declared dead.
It's a disingenuous argument to pick specific comments about blocksize made by him over 7 years ago and pretend he'd own that exact same opinion today.
@_date: 2017-07-02 15:57:40


Not quite. More specifically, they want a big eyeballed increase in block size without justification or testing. They definitely don't want dynamic block size algorithms, which do exist and they never mention.


I disagree here. If they say they are against SW but can't(won't) articulate an argument why, one can only assume it's because they are against off-chain solutions (or have been misinformed by people that are).


Patently false, as the lightning network is literally open source. And even if it weren't, there's nothing stopping other solutions from emerging, and that's the point: to allow an ecosystem of varied, competing or not, off-chain solutions &amp; services to develop around the bitcoin blockchain, literally the opposite of centralisation.


Again more misinformation, doesn't even make sense. The existence of an off-chain service can only take off use cases from the main-chain, which can only decrease load and fees.


As long as there's no conclusion, the network will remain congested and miners can keep on collecting very high transaction fees.

What potential hard fork?
@_date: 2017-07-03 00:49:18


Actually, I think it is. You can't choose who runs channels, but you can choose which channels you trust/use, if any. Even if you don't trust a channel privacy-wise it should be possible to connect through TOR, so it's a moot issue there.
Also, I can't see any reference to a relationship between liquid and the lightning network. They're unrelated as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2017-07-02 23:00:44


It doesn't matter who they are, the point I was making is that






I don't know what you've been reading but you have been very misled. Segwit is a change in the bitcoin protocol (which is open source already) which changes the way transaction's are organised, so to speak. Lightning is a separate piece of software which enables the creation of fast payment channels, the software is open source, which means anyone can copy the source code, compile and run it. Regarding privacy and being trustless I guess that would depend on whom the channels belong to.


Not at all. The main chain will be the bitcoin ocean providing liquidity and settlement, basically the weave connecting all the ecosystem: exchanges, payment channels, smart contracts(RSK), etc. With the average block time at 10 minutes the main chain will never be good enough for many types of transactions anyway, and other types will always prefer to be done directly through the main chain once it's no longer congested.


Do they really? Have you done the math? I haven't but suspect they're making much more as it is, for the transaction fee has nearly doubled in the last year last I checked.


I don't know who Axa is, nor much about the technicals of lightning, but from what I understand anyone can run channels and collect fees, since the code is open source. Blockchain probably already has a neat service figured out around lightning I guess. Still competition should arise, I'd bet exchanges and what not will open lightning-based services of their own.

I'm no expert but I think it can "work" for a long while, albeit in a very centralized manner, which I suppose is not what most users would call working as intended.
