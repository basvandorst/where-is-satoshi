I'll have to go and check it out someday. 
It's a pain to get to since I'm working in midtown now.

Every account that you have should be enabled. Go to  and check which site supports it and enable it. 
If the site is listed and doesn't support it, tell them by tweeting. 
Also, I recommend using [Authy]( instead of Google Authenticator. Authy will link your 2FA keys to your phone and email address and back them up for you. They also have a chrome plugin that can display the same keys.

Why does KnC require my mobile phone # ? 
I'm going to stick with the mycelium client. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 21:40:29
Yes.. and everyone keeps referring to it as a virtual currency during that NY Dept. of Finance hearing. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:31:08
I remember watching that. Good information about fiat currency and how it came about. I don't remember the part you're talking about, but I'll have to watch it again.

I just watched this episode yesterday.
As soon as the lead FBI agent talked about the dark net, I knew bitcoins would be mentioned somewhere.. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:41:53
I just saw this on the side of a bus. 
Link for info:
@_date: 2014-01-27 14:01:23
It does sound like stupid frat boys doing stupid things..
@_date: 2014-01-27 14:04:32
I'm down for one of those. 
I was just talking to my wife about getting a closed terrarium. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 13:20:29
Where was this going on?  I don't remember hearing of this. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 18:20:06
Yes, I know it's factually incorrect. That was established in the other thread. 
I posted this because of all the naysayers of bitcoin, saying that it's only used by drug dealers and for illegal activity. This just shows that any currency (especially USD) is already heavily used by drug dealers. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:28:03
Yes. 
They're handing them out just in time for Chinese New Year. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:23:47
Its a little out of my way,  but I may have to stop buy just to support him and bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:00:45
Link or episode # for those that don't watch Justified?  
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:01:02
I guess people can ruin any type of currency. 
people will do anything to make some money
@_date: 2014-01-27 14:30:51
Sounds like fear mongering with the whole Trojan Horse portion. 
The bitcoin-qt client is open source. If there was a trojan horse, someone would have already seen it and called it out. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:02:44
Is that even possible? 
I hope not. That's the major problem with fiat currency. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:35:26
For those that are concerned. Use a dropbox encryption software. 
I use [SafeMonk]( and I put my bitcoin stuff in there. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 05:17:56
Remember kids, backup your 2fa app or make sure you have the backup keys!  
Backups backups backups!  
Did I mention how important backups are?

Actually, David Marcus himself did not say anything about NFC. He just said that he wants Paypal to be used in the in-store payment world. The NFC mentioned in this article was a discussion with someone else. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:28:31
They just opened one up in Midtown East. Lex and 52nd.
They're a bit pricey though :-\
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:36:23
Still no support for other credit cards besides a Visa, which I don't have one...
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:01:50
oh... Yeah that sucks then..
No major drugstores nearby? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:49:38
Must be all those wigs you guys have to wear.. 
I wouldn't want to wear it either.

They're going to have to wait a few days to get their candy.. Coinbase takes a while :\
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:49:28
I actually tried Entropay. I put $5 and there was $.25 fee. 
Coinbase said no debt card support at this time when I tried to use it. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 15:47:47
That's pretty cool. Did you bring those in specifically to spread the word about bitcoin or is there usually candy for sale? 
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:39:07
Yeah I wish they would accept other cards

Of course the CEO of Paypal is going to say that about NFC, they're trying to compete with NFC in the mobile payment world. (with their phone number+PIN payment and Beacon in the future).
The reason NFC hasn't taken off (in the US, it's pretty big in Asia) is because Apple has not adopted it and is trying to use something different (iBeacon). 
Also, the three big carriers (AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile) delayed NFC by blocking Google Wallet, and trying to launch their own NFC payment app (Isis). 
I, for one, use Google Wallet whenever I can. Like I always have my phone and not having to pull out my wallet and credit card is very convenient. 
EDIT: punctuation.....eats, shoots, and leaves
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:01:31
I do that too, but wouldn't the bank just overdraw and charge you for it (unless you had coverage). 
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:21:15
You can use it at any place that accepts Mastercard PayPass or Visa PayWave. It doesn't necessarily have to say that they accept Isis. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:35:43
I did.  They suggest contacting the bank. I think its because it's a joint checking. I'll call the bank..
@_date: 2013-11-10 12:06:11
I can't get instant buy verified on coinbase because I don't have a Visa card :-(  
I have a Visa debit card but there's issues verifying billing address. For some reason it just doesn't match even though I put what's on the statement exactly. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 21:19:51
how did you get it to scan? My btc client wouldn't pick up the QR code..
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:02:08
Which one do you use? I was able to purchase on coinbase over the weekend. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:39:50
Can you comment on your testing? What have you been doing so far? 
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:00:33
I still have to work today :-\
Perks of working on these "lesser" holidays (Vet's day, Columbus Day, etc..), less traffic into the city. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 21:16:42
Don't ever come to a bar in NYC... You'll want the whole thing to be liquid gold..
