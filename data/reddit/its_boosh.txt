Yeah I think their fee structure is wrong right now. Mine has taken over 2 hours.

Is it from coinbase?

Longest bear market?

Then why are you even borrowing?

It would mean the entire BTC market is inflated... By alot. I'm not saying it's happening, I'm saying it possible. 
If tether itself can print its own tether for itself and then use that tether to buy BTC that would mean tether is leveraging on its own worthless currency to then go on and leverage more. Eventually the house of cards would fall. 
Again, it's just a theory.
Edit: I think I understand your confusion now. Tether can be used to buy Bitcoin and then Bitcoin can be sold for FIAT. So tether can essentially print its own money. 
Tether can print 11k tether, buy one Bitcoin, and then sell that Bitcoin for USD. They just created 11k USD out of nothing.

Yeah... The 1% in BTC aren't hodlers.

My point is: if you make 6 figures and have no bills, then you should have plenty of cash flow. In which case taking a 16 percent interest loan to buy a bit of Bitcoin makes little sense.

That's still a horrible investment. Your traditional investments historically won't outpace the 16% interest rate you are going to pay. 
And even if you didn't have cash on hand and didn't want to take money out of your other investments, the way better play would be just to take out a simple 10-12% personal loan. (Though still a bad play). 
And that's assuming you do actually have a 16% interest on cash advances credit card. I've never seen a low cash advance card like that. I'm guessing you have a normal APR at 16% but cash advances are treated differently and the average cash advance APR is like 26%. Also most cards have a 5 or so percent cash advance fee on the total withdrawn. 
Cash advance is among one of the most costly ways to get cash in hand.

That's exactly the concern. Tether to BTC trading still sees tons of volume.
