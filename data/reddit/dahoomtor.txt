I hope you learned your lesson to use 2 factor authorization next time.

Wait longer. It will go down to $40.
@_date: 2013-08-18 10:47:08
Tell that to USA secret police officers. You'll have a hard time.

I don't understand.
For $30 I could have my private key engraved in a aluminium, steel, titanium or copper plate and QR code laser-engraved.
This would be a nice gimmick for $3, but $30? Way way too expensive.

Probably someone at the NSA needed some money for the night club.
@_date: 2013-09-06 09:05:04
OK, you are currently receiving a few BTC on your 50btc account. Enjoy.

No, it's a guy from the bitcointalk.org forum that runs this. Works flawless.
@_date: 2013-09-15 21:02:40
Bitcoin users not affected.
@_date: 2013-08-25 18:00:28
Sell sell sell. Bitcoin is going to crash next week to $50.

USA is turning pretty Nazi lately.
ALWAYS(!) delete your entire harddrive when entering the soviet USA. Only enter America with deleted harddrive. The US regime will copy your entire laptop and steal ALL data at immigration. Only carry important data on encrypted USB Sticks with very good passwords. Install OS when you got past US immigration.
I had my business laptop data stolen twice before by US regime secret police at immigration at the airport. They ask you to hand them your laptop, disappear 30 minutes, copy everything and give it back to you.
AGAIN, this can't be repeated often enough: ERASE your entire harddrive before entering that country!!

THe crash is coming. Sell sell sell

credentials invalid.
Redmetal does not appear to be your correct worker name.
@_date: 2013-08-25 17:55:45
Thats because nobody is using cavirtex. I never heard of them. They might run away with your Dollars or Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-15 14:55:07
Trading bots.

It is illegal to bring funds &gt;$10000 into the US without declaring it.
@_date: 2013-08-20 18:49:47
You can never be sure.
Only secure way is to not trust machines but use dice or coins to generate private key.
@_date: 2013-08-24 08:42:03
Only purchase Nazi made gold bars. Avoid American made gold bars. Only way to be sure.
@_date: 2013-08-19 06:40:10
I think about 2000 people are using Bitcoin.

In Soviet USA government tracks you.

Is it possible to order them without hologramm? I don't want to remove glue. ;)
If the password is strong enough,  there is no way of decrypting the private key from the encrypted key.
How long is delivery?

Nazi Victory!

Yes, Bitcoin was invented by NSA. 
Satoshi Nakamoto  = NSA. Everybody knows.
Hint: Nakamoto SAtoshi .... NSA

Buy butterfly labs miner, they are the bedt. You will be rich in no time.
@_date: 2013-09-20 16:11:01
Yes sure, but given a strong password there is just no way. I could even post my encrypted private key to Facebook. 
Maybe I will do, good way to backup. ;)
