Coinbase needs to adopt Segwit wallets asap, and they also need some competition in the crypto space...something simple with fiat on-ramps. Segwit --&gt; Lightning Network

Any new big crypto hedge funds popping up in early 2018?

Don't get greedy. I've seen so many greedy people get slaughtered.

Pay your suppliers with Fiat. They pay the merchant fees.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:47:05
Not yet. It will be sometime in the future.

Doesn't affect consumers more than it does with retailers, which is a good selling point for vendors to accept BTC.

F them

Why didn't Crypto shoot up in the wake of the Turkey turmoil?

Just, buy back $3 of btc on the dip. If we just hodl and not spend, then it’ll be worthless one day.

I guess the SEC goes after OPEC everytime they influence the energy markets, no?
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:43:09
Wow! Did someone actually put that up there?
@_date: 2018-05-05 15:50:01
And this time is the real $10K. Lol
@_date: 2018-05-19 06:30:03
Everything has to go through an evolution. This is the only way to discover which will be strongest and, in turn, prevail. This is not just crypto. This is for pretty much anything in the world.

Implication they're going to drop the service?

$5,611, limit order on GDAX. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:25:01
Not impressed. We need to go higher!
But, nice setup in your car.
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:07:45
Is there any chance that adoption slowed down due to the decreasing price of BTC?
I mean as a business owner, wouldn't you want your sales/payments to increase or at least be stable over time? Why would you take anything that's decreasing in value, for the time being? It's almost like I sell something to you for $10, but you pay me with something that's going to be worth $9 tomorrow. Why should I take that form of payment?
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:18:27
Kinda late now, no? I mean most woke rich people already invested in Pantera Fund. Again, Coinbase is late to the game. ��
@_date: 2017-09-13 10:43:28
I should've been more clear. When I said sell, I didn't mean sell permanently. I mean sell now and buy back when prices are lower. Buy low, sell high. Looks like I made the right decision, for the time being.

You might have to spell it out "Bitcoin" for most to understand.
Excellent idea, though. I'm gonna start doing the same thing.
@_date: 2018-04-16 04:56:13
That run up was much larger than 2017. Yet, it seems like the media didn't really catch on until last year. Now coverage is nearly non-existent again.How much media exposure was there for the 2011-2013 run up, from $1 to $1K? 
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:28:34
They're scaling up to 32MB blocks some time in the summer, and Bitpay allows BCH transactions now.
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:29:41
I know, right!!! But, I don't mind. I made a lot more in BTC upside than the amount of fees I paid for transaction costs.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:16:26
Question now is...who in the blue heck is doing all this selling?
A lot of people are saying this is panic selling, but who triggered this sell off in the first place?
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:03:38
Looks like she's indicating that the next floor/support is about $1,480 for BTC, and $140'ish for ETH...saw in another article for ETH. So far, she's been correct about ETH, which corrected about 35%-38% from the peak, hitting about $145, before bouncing to $150. I feel like she's someone we should be following. We don't have to trade based on what she says now, but she's worth a follow, just to see what's her track record is going to be like in the near future.
@_date: 2017-07-10 06:46:01
I believe that's what many people who knows anything about Bitcoin is waiting for: segwit.
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:19:35
I don't know if bitcoin is going to go back up in the future, but as long as software developers continue to build on crypto blockchains, they will find a use case that will be very relevant to society. And when that day comes, which is inevitable, then smart investors and institutions are going to jump in, and that's when crypto will take off. When this will happen? Nobody knows. But, crypto will under the guise of these new DApps (or decentralized apps), not bitcoin. It'll be similar to how people used Yahoo and Amazon back in the mid 90's, instead of "http". People say they used (or invested) in AOL, Yahoo, or Netscape, not "http".
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:52:07
Probably not so much the developers than the shillers and market manipulators.
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:03:42
I don't know, but I always just buy more on every leg down. It takes all the "panic" out of my emotions.
