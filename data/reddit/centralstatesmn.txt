Against old wisdom that many, including me used to give, I would recommend not moving coins into a private wallet unless you have more than a couple hundred dollars or more. Coinbase charges way too much in their transfer fees at the moment. This will largely be a static fee, so the fee is a lot if you move a little money, or a little if you move a decent amount of money. 
I say this with the presumption that you want ro save BTC, not spend them soon. If this is the case, just practice very safe browsing methods, have a stronf password, and activate two factor authentication.

I sold my 401k for BTC at the beginning of 2013. In hindsight, it was stupid, but it proved to be life changing. I live a very simple life and have realized a small fraction of my gains, but I think you will make out well, despite the historical imprudence. We are only 15% in to a monster S-curve

**BTC works with Expedia**
I was baffled that nobody else was reporting Expedia BTC payments being down. What happened is that I was using the Brave Browser (awesome browser by the way). Brave sometimes rejects scripts and clearly rejected the scripts that populate different payment methods. I was able to pull up bookings in Google Chrome. I wonder if Brave recently did an update that conflicts with a lot of website scripting.

I call BS. You don't run a large bitcoin mining operation without having all of your ducks in a row first.

**I think this is fake news.**
 2x GPU rigs and 2x ASICs use about as much electricity as 3 space heaters, maybe a little more if he is running the GPUs with inefficient specs. At 13 degrees Fahrenheit outside temperature, I'd bet that he shut the heater off quick before filming the video. I am highly suspicious that he is heating a 1,650 sq ft home with this amount of equipment and no help from his actual home heating system.

I've owned and have spent BTC to pay for things for a long time. The network congestion is no joke. Expedia just pulled the BTC payment option. I used this for practically all of my traveling. 
*edit* BTC works with Expedia

Hi Yanni and Jack

Cash out 15k for a handful of weeks. You get a chance to open limits wider after this after more verification steps

Consensus is holding BTC back from a hard fork. It's a feature, not a bug. The legacy chain wears a chastity belt. She'll take it off only for the best proposals.

I have a surplus of BTC from being a long time holder. Most people have a little selling pressure to get by, including me. It just makes sense to spend BTC sometimes.

I think most people that have been in the space for awhile are sick of hearing about making millions and owning lambos. The getting out of debt stories are fine, but talking about lambos and making millions is tacky. 
If there's anything that I'm sure of, it's that most of Bitcoins "most ardent fans" live simple lives.

The new Federal Reserve chairman said the same thing. They have to triage threats....and there are a lot of more pressing threats towards the central banking system right now.

I code. I don't think that problem would be that hard to solve. Implementing it on a large scale would require a lot of caution though. 
Amazon has plenty of reason to accept BTC. It's money. Who doesn't like money? It's kind of like how it has always been very easy to buy Gold / Silver / Platinum bullion from online sellers using BTC. They take your coins and convert to USD right away. On top of that, there is no chance that you can reverse the transaction on them, which is enormous for the bullion industry.

If you buy on exchange, you have more advanced options as opposed to buying from Coinbase. Some of these advanced options include trading on a margin / levered up, but most people just buy BTC at the current price or "program" when their order will execute. I could hop on an exchange and "program" it to sell 1.337 BTC if the price in USD reaches $1200 / BTC. This is exactly what a lot of people did.

Sell walls were being taken down all day. 
By this, I mean people can set their sell out point into fiat or another crypto and walk the dog, go for a swim, fall in love, or go to sleep. The buyers had to sledgehammer these sell walls at $10,000.

Quickest would be to find a FinCen licensed seller on Localbitcoins with a MSB license if required by your state. 
Coinbase will make you wait a handful of days. For yiur first transactions. It's a prudent practice in my opinion. Identity theft is rampant nowadays. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:36:05
Nice explanation.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:33:47
The uninitiated to BTC would get angry transacting on a network with 100k+ transactions on the mempool and people might make the huge mistake of hopping to a shitcoin. BTC will scale extremely well, but it needs just a little more time to introduce the scaling solutions. At risk of extreme backlash from people that do not understand the network, BTC is best used as a speculative vehicle / store or wealth or for pushing $50+ transactions  satoshi/byte fee.
**All of this will change soon though. After that, I'd welcome the major retailers. **
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:27:52
People are unaware of derivatives coming up. Also, people don't think about Coinbase onboarding 150k people a day lately. These people are not signing up and going through a week long verification process to NOT buy Bitcoins. 
10k is a psychological notch, but people act as if people, especially wealthy people get rid of their entire positions instead of skimming some cream off the top and keep holding. 
People that are Bitcoin-wealthy (more than a few hundred thousand) got that way because they believed in Bitcoin for a long time.. when nobody else did. Bitcoin multimillionaires had a radical mindset and outstanding prescience. They are not going to stop believing now.

Now is the time to research and practice safe browsing techniques. Get a free, or preferably paid for version of a vetted anti-malware or anti-virus (they both kind of do the same things now). Immediately activate two factor authorization and bookmark exchanges and account URLs so you do not get phished. 
Last, against a lot of advice that other people would give, I wouldn't move that $50 off an exchange right now (I presume you bought from an exchange / Coinbase). The Xfer transaction will cut too far into your $50 and might confuse you. Eating a transaction fee for a larger amount ($125 for instance) is much easier to handle. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:37:22
We've seen Ver push thousands of BTC from his wallets to Bitfinex. I'm glad that they are taking a hard line stance considering he has most likely given them a lot of business. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:01:39
Just be warned that with almost any pool and on only one GPU, there will be minimum withdraw limits, so 6-14 days may pass between each disbursement. A person running a 10 GPU rig could be eligible to be paid out several times per day.

House? Apartment? You'll need a special area for it because they are loud. Also, it will eat up the vast majority of a 15 amp outlet meaning switching anything else on for that entire electrical circuit will trip breakers. This is especially troubling for apartments. 
I also forgot to mention that you would be funneling money to a manufacturer that many Bitcoiners think is the enemy (Bitmain). There are new ASIC manufacturers coming out soon. I do smaller scale mining, mostly as a hobby, so I am excited to decentralize things a little by running an ASIC that's not given to me by the Bitmain / Bcash cabal. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:48:07
I can't think of any way an Amazon coin would be different than an Amazon gift card. Think centralization vs decentralization. AmazonCoin doesn't have any more use that an Amazon gift card. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:32:54
Converting to fiat via a payment processor or not, the network needs mode throughput. I guarantee this would be their primary concern. The online retailers you just listed fielded transactions via Bitpay on an empty mempool. Times are different now. People complain about $6 fees on $10 purchases and their transactions not even being picked up by the network for 3 days.

Amazon would first have to pressure major exchanges (I'm looking at you Coinbase) to go Segwit or they would be inundated with angry customers.

It's still a fun hobby. Nothing beats the knowledge you will pick up in regards to digital tokens and how things work behind ths scenes. Even people that have transacted and traded for a long time often know very little about the mining and reward processes. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:52:44
You can close the laptop. There are a few operating system settings to change to make sure your laptop still runs when the lid is shut. 
Yes, I mean at current price. I would recommend just using Nicehash.com to mine so you can see how the process works. They pay out in BTC, which is deflationary and increases im price vs the dollar. So if you collected $2/day for 300 days and suddenly the price of BTC went to $40k, you would have essentially been making $8/day profit.  
After you see how that system works, you can directly mine different tokens if you'd like. You would just have to download different software and learn different pool rules.

There is a popular service. I'm sure someone could name them. You give them as much information as you can and they actually do an okay job at recovering considering humans are bad at entropy and knowing even 1/3 of your password will get them far.

The biggest retailer in the world accepting BTC transactions when people expect it to be a miracle solution to online payment would set us back. We will get there, but opening up the floodgates to BTC transactions would be a miserable experience for both the customer and Amazon because of the network congestion and all of the customer service requests they will have to field. 
Overstock, Expedia, Cheapair etc have already went through these growing pains and have trained staff (you always get escalated two levels to sort out BTC transaction issues). They did this on an empty mempool. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:02:55
Air BNB is much smaller. Also, their CEO is now the CEO of Expedia, one of the very first merchants to service BTC. They will probably be able to do a better job at integrating BTC before Amazon.

If you have a miner, it needs 99% uptime. With mining 3 days per week, paying off your ASIC will take a very long time. Two new generations of more powerful and efficient miners will probably be manufactured in that time...
ASICS can and do trip circuits, yes, but I don't know what your typical hotel room electrical system couls handle.

Do you want something that sounds like a jet engine in your apartment? They don't make quiet ASICs.

Sounds like you want to GPU mine then. You would need a gaming laptop - an expensive one with at least a GTX 1070 and a thick, open base that can blow the air out or else ths GPU will downclock and suck at hashing. Your profit will be about $1.50-$2.25 per full day. 
For profit, you'd currently be on equihash likely mining Zcash or maybe Bitcoin Gold. Maybe Vertcoin
