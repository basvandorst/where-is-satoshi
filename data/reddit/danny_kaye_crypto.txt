I think most mostly it will be a whole much ado about nothing. The price has been factored in since they announced that plan 2 years ago. If it doesn't get postponed again. Also since it is a essentially just an exchange (while settled in actual btc which is great) it is all open to a very select few of traders which is pretty much the opposite of decentralization. So I'm not expecting too much if anything to happen.

Can Anyone Vouch for these guys? I want to buy a few shirts but they are new and theres not a lot of proof of solid business to back up quality.   
Do the shirt sizes run smaller or larger on average?  
Can anyone comment on the material.

And It takes much less than that to get black listed from major exchanges and payment processors.

I tend to agree with privacy being implemented. Would automatic and mandatory first layer privacy go against the fundamental vision of bitcoin? Maybe yeah....but I also feel like privacy is more important than an originating vision, and that goals/ideals evolve as needs and times change . However above all decentralization and fungibility are the most important. So imo in order to maintain a resemblance of what bitcoin is, these two factors can not be sacrificed by any means in the quest to implement privacy.   
I recall when Beam and Grin hit the scene and everyone started talking about implementing Mimble Wimble into the bitcoin core code... Now I dont know enough about MW and how it works to even say if it is as effective as something like Monero Ring sigs, but honestly at the end of the day I feel like even if we could implement complete privacy without sacrificing any other aspects of the blockchain, the "Power that be" for lack of a better phrase wouldn't allow it.  How an entity would go about enforcing that I am not sure, but I know of agencies that have done a lot worse for a lot less.
