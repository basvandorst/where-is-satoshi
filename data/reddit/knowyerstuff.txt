Did you make the purchase in past 5-10 biz days? Coin base actually fronts you the crypto till it completely clears the bank
@_date: 2019-11-02 19:29:42
Am I still tripping?

This is cool asf, but I think we should steer from traditional "payment methods" (for a lack of better terms). Fuck it, let's all get out qrs tatted :p

Did you move $25 into a coin? Its dumb but they won't even let you move to CBpro until it clears completely. Pretty sure I'm banned from CB from taking advantage of this... I made over $1k off them fronting me crypto lol.

This guy knows his shit...

Cashapp is best for buying, but it's not an exchange. Can only buy BTC. I convert 90% of my paycheck every week to BTC and just sell at register if I need the $ for a purchase.
@_date: 2019-10-27 02:26:28
I disagree... everyone wants to hodl, but the money is made between the lines. Buy low, sell high.

Same, fees way too high for one
@_date: 2019-10-04 12:06:48
It's a fucking Supra tho...
@_date: 2019-10-12 16:37:07
No way... Even if the entire world puts their wealth into btc
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:18:13
Yes it is... Much cheaper than buying from CB
@_date: 2019-09-20 15:48:49
Cash app is wat I ended up using. Cost me like %1
@_date: 2019-09-16 03:17:27
It's a stinger... They're super sexy
@_date: 2019-09-20 13:02:22
I'm in US ..
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:17:39
Eh... Not thru cash app... ^^ check the chart this man supplied.
@_date: 2019-09-20 18:15:29
Oh it's already been moved to CBpro, hard to beat the 1.6%... wats ur reason as to why only use bank account?
@_date: 2019-09-16 03:16:55
This is a stinger and it's in America... They're really nice
@_date: 2019-09-20 13:04:57
Just don't wanna have to wait days for the transaction to go thru my account. That's why I don't have an account setup now is cuz I wasn't thinking and $ got spent so had return.
@_date: 2019-09-13 20:48:49
I can't upvote this enough
@_date: 2019-09-20 16:00:38
It was, but it actually went thru my bank as credit, funds are on hold
@_date: 2019-09-29 22:57:13
Is address on your checking account different from the one on your ID? I had this same message one time and that's why
@_date: 2019-09-27 14:05:24
That maybe, but in this case he actually meant fly on the backs of the giant eagles...
@_date: 2019-09-16 03:17:13
And he's driving a stinger? I like this guy
@_date: 2019-09-20 15:51:09
