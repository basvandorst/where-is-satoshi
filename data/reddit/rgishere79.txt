Where do you think it will be in a year? Will the difference from now to tomorrow really matter.

I was worried about this. I just sent a transfer today. I only did 1,400 though to make sure it goes through. Hope all goes well for you and me lol

Wallstreet wants to kill bitcoincore. Invest in bitcoin cash or the upcoming B2x and proclaim it the real bitcoin.

Thanks guys you rock!

I believe the best advice is don't sell on the dip. There's been big swings in BTC. They don't last forever but they happen. When futures get involved swings may be bigger. Prepaid your self mentality for a drop that could be 50% or more. Know it could happen and don't sell. Instead think of where you can get more cash to buy more

How many unaccounted for transaction does bcash have? Are their fees 40 bucks? How long are their wait times? After answering those questions using logic which one is more usable?

Finally someone gets it
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:18:01
What if it dies die though. Wallstreet doesn't want it to win. They want to proclaim it dead and name some other coin king that will give them more upside. I don't like bcash or Roger Ver but he has more strategic pieces then BTC. And all the talk of it being centralized doesn't amount to S+hit because that's what the masses are use to and comfortable with. B2x coming out on the 28th. 6 other forks happening this month alone. All the pieces corporate need to flat line BTC. Talk of dilution, talk or extremely high fees, slow transition times, u able to get out in a timely manner and losing big profits if you keep your coins on a hard wear wallet. What the community of Crytpo fails to realize is everything gets ruined by mainstream. Think with brain and not heart.

The bigger shame is missing out on the gains from the crypto until its resolved! 
@_date: 2018-10-27 17:14:42
Most don't own stocks and only associate with crypto. Also most are new investors and think the swing from a grand to 20X profit in a few months is the norm. 
These souls wonder  "when Lambo?" 
@_date: 2018-10-27 17:23:38
No double spend problem once most the supply is  ran by things like Bakkt it'll all he centralized and regulated. People are sheep. The Idea of BTC is very grand but instead of taking over big money it will be controlled by big money.

I'm going Crazy conspiracy theory there. B2x never said they weren't going to split. They simply said not at this time. A few whales are manipulating the market making BTC crash hard and fast. Sooner then later B2x goes though and all hell brakes loose? I imagine people are going crazy waiting for their BTC sells to go through. In the mean time bch is going to the moon and all these buggers are missing out. It's proving to people that BTC has to change  
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:46:23
Interesting so are you saying because of the current value of bitcoin cash the miners are paid by 3rd parties to keep the coin alive?  What is the exact block number? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:23:17
Coinbase has said they will issue you the segwit2x coins and will provide their own replay protection for you. Just another big company trying to make money off you. I don't like betting against big money. I'm not selling any coins even if one goes down to 4 bucks. My opinion is let them both ride
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:07:07
Ok makes sense. Thanks for the information I found it helpful. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:47:02
Bitcoin has split to bitcoin cash and soon to split into b2x. Granted they are all different but it's created 3 times the amount of bitcoins in some variation. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:49:38
B2x is greasy. It's aimed at making the rich more money. Places like coin base are backing b2x and offering replay protection. They also said once the dust settles if b2x is the Victor they will refer to it as simply bit coin. I don't like what I'm saying but I see b2x value for the first few months or more taking a huge noise dive then being bought buy big money. The price will raise till its the new bitcoin and the average Joe is screwed because the majority dumped their coins. They have enough money that they can probably give a bonus to miners or give them a wage if they only mine bx2. If they buy into  the fact that b2x will be worth more to mine eventually anyways and they get a bonus as well; what's to stop the original bitcoin to being almost worthless. We like to think we the community make that decision but if it comes down to it our opinion is worthless.

I hold mine in Jaxx as well. I've been trying to find out what happens to my coins when the hard fork happens though? How do I ensure I also get my bitcoinsegwit? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:00:02
Can we just call it market manipulation already. I mean I get what you're saying but this is not a pump and dump. Market manipulation=big accounts effecting prices had big volume. Pump and dump = promoters telling a glorious story;the masses drink the kool-aid and drive the prices up normally with avg to slightly above avg volume. After this the big boys dump big volume on the market decreasing the value. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:20:06
I hope I can get to your mindset. I'm worried about them "buying miner's" I'd like to think that miners would like to stick with why they believe in. When it comes down to it though they are in it for profit like all of us. I think I'm just holding my bitcoinsegwit2x coins. If I keep both I want maximize profits but in essence I won't lose either.

Written like a lunatic.
 Believe it or not bitcoin will not take over the world and fiat value will not die. 
If you think fiat value will no longer exist you have zero knowledge of how world  economics work. 
@_date: 2018-11-05 23:54:05
I realize it has no effect. I'm just curious as to what % hold on and what % sell. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:25:40
Then they know how much you got in your wallet
@_date: 2018-11-10 03:08:08
No you need almost 400% gains from here. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:06:53
What the Fuck dude. You should just  buy scratch tickets since you don't have a damm clue about crypto. 
No BAT or ZRX won't reach 20K
@_date: 2018-12-04 19:20:48
Very good point. Any pow should be included.
@_date: 2018-12-04 08:01:40
This report is so full of shit and you all look bad promoting it. Most of the renewable energy would also probably be from hydro power dams that wreck the environment of mother nature. Plus it sure as hell isn't free. 
If you dive deep in too i would bet that if a minning rig  uses solar 10% of the time and coal power the rest of the time they label it as using renewable energy.

Let the centralization begin!
