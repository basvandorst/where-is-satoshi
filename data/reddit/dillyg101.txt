First pool I ever mined with, sad to see it go.

No joke, I'm going to download the game now. Just because this guy doesn't want me to.

That doesn't let you write blatant lies. I can't write an article saying "smokes crack" unless I have the proof to back it up. Freedom of the press lets you write about whatever truths you want, but it won't protect liars.

That's simply not true, and you have no statistics to back up that ridiculous and outlandish claim.

I understand it's a lot to ask of a small operation like Voat, but they'll get my business when they get a mobile app.

I have an iphone unfortunately, but thats good news! Hopefully they have one for iOS soon.

Can someone please get rid of this fuckwad? Every week we read about how he is doing something that goes against what everyone else thinks is right.

*facepalm* god dammit... A friendly reminder to always proof-read your posts kids...

Well as depressing as that was, thanks. Like I said, it's just kind of a hobby, I don't really expect to see anything more than a dollar lol I just think it's interesting. I'll look at altcoin stuff. 
Side note: Thanks!

God, i glanced over it and missed that, sorry for breaking the rules. But yes that's I mean. 
Also it's not overclocked, just got it a few months ago.

Do you put any of your art on canvas or any kind of thing that I can buy? Also, how long did the piece take you? I love the kind of style and colors you use, it has a very 1950's feel to it. Well done!

Cool, thanks! I just started getting involved with Bitcoin, it's really cool to see people like you who are dedicated to making this movement happen, thanks for being awesome
