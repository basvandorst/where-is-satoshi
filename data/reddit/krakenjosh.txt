I completely understand, but your deposit has been on hold less then 4 days. Our tier 3 team had requested a clearer photo and once it was provided was working to verify your account to tier 3 which can take a few days. 
In any case, your deposit should now be credited.

Typically that means you entered an ACH routing number instead of a wire transfer one.
