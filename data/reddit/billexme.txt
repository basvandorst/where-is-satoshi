Scam proof escrow keeps scammers away. Why would scammer use the service if he knows he cannot win. And If scammers stay away then everything works smoothly. Down side of this type of escrow is that If scammer uses the service anyway (for fun for example) then the innocent person would loose his money. But this could happen also in case of normal escrow service. I might add option to use "normal" escrow as well.

Thank you for the comment. I agree that the website needs total re-design by professionals. Also the concept need to be finetuned and clearly explained. I would need more people to be involved. Right time for this site could be when authorities starts closing traditional exchanges.

I had not heard about klout. I have to check that out. No computer generated number with Billex. Solution is much more simplier.

They call it bullet proof vest even if some bullet will go trough :) But I agree that some other name same should descripe this escrow better.

Site is not ready. I am testing the concept at the moment. If the idea works then custom made site using better hosting service should be easily done. Site will only collect email addresses when you place an ad. After that all communication happens via email.

Congratulations.  I think you just killed my scam proof escrow concept :( and I guess that normal escrow is better for my site after all. 
What about main features of my site? Invisible bank accounts and anonymous service. (both of these are due to usage of third party bank accounts) 
I am claiming that if authorities want to stop bitcoin exchanges then they will have hard time stopping billex.me. I guess they would target the website itself from working. But as Piratebay has shown it is not that easy. Can you think of other ways to prevent billex.me from operating? 
Also if someone wants to keep his bitcoin transactions anonymous then billex.me is almost as good as cash transactions.
