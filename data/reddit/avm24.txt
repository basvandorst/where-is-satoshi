Government still needs to run.  Most of the upper economy is run on capital gains and thus the most tax money.

Whats the end goal when developers talk about creating a bitcoin "protocol"?

When it comes to cold storage, I print off a public/private address and send my coins from Coinbase to it.  Wouldn't that publish my cold storage address on the chain and open me up to risk?

Fair enough, i'm well aware of multi-sig, i thought we were talking about reversibility in terms of preventing fraud or accidental spending seeing as the OP made an exception for escrow on large purchases.

Sidechains &amp; "Two peg systems", can I get a ELI~10?
My interpretation so far is that coins are passed to a side chain and essentially locked up while it processes change of ownership/conversions to other coins and then returned to the original block chain to be validated?  And then these side chains have their own "miners"?
Edit: Is there any value to learning economic theories of currency or does bitcoin tend to respond differently?

Even with escrow/arbitration, on the level your asking for would require a massive enterprise. And we're back at square one.

What's the relationship between halving and blocksize?  
In my mind Bitcoin value, and an ideal alternative to modern banking are not zero-sum.  If we implement the best possible system then we can work on long-term sustainability thus increasing the value.

So your proposing I use an arbitration system that keeps track of my usual trusted parties and then requires me to get ahold of them and approve un-trusted parties?  Who would be willing to manage a system like that for dirt cheap?  If i'm that paranoid about my money getting stolen ill just go back to using a CC.

You identify 4mb block attacks, then propose increasing the blocksize?  If this is a serious attack, then it needs a solution before we start addressing scalability.  It doesn't seem like a problem with SegWit.
This feeds into my next point that your arguments and SegWit are not completely mutually exclusive.  The goal is to refine the blockchain now while its small before we start looking into scalability issues.
