Yep; that was my point. You don’t see the knowledgeable people wasting their time here when things are happening .

Well, I did see the wallet with the 8999 coins sitting there, so it seemed pretty real. But, let's say it wasn't a hoax then, what would cause that to happen?
As for the wallets/addresses... So, for every 1 private key, I could have multiple addresses? Or does 1 private key = 1 receiving address?
Sorry, hate to sound this stupid, but the whole 100 keys thing just never clicked with me.
I understand it as:
I have a private key, and a public key. With my public key, I receive BTC, while with my private key, I get access to my funds. Where to the 100 addresses come in here?
Thanks again and sorry for sounding dumb!

I thought it was me selling at 10900 that did it; I see we acted together to help everyone then.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:22:20
Easy one: our parents would have ruined it.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:06:46
Yeah... I was trying to simplify my question, that's all.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:45:54
And down it goes! And this time I didn't even buy anything; all I had to do was talk about doing it, haha.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:37:35
Sounds like a keeper.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:12:05
I assumed, but lost profits feel almost as a loss in itself...
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:40:38
Do they usually say ahead of time when tether will be printed?
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:02:22
I truly hoped someone would assume that, thanks for the laugh, haha. Gotta make sure past-me knows how to do this right.

Student debt:
"How come you are still in debt? Back in my day, .0482476421 BTC would last me a whole month after I paid all my bills, and I didn't even have a college degree!"
"What do you mean you want to make 2BTC a year? Everyone here started at 0.0000001 and did just fine!"
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:05:56
On  if that is the case, how did that guy manage to lose the 8999 BTC? That's the part that I can't seem to comprehend! 
And thanks for the help!

Every time I think I suffer a lot, I remember those individuals and it makes my life seem a lot better.
Hopefully at the end of the day it won't make a significant difference when 1 BTC = 12.34 Lambo's.

I am this person. Started with .1 BTC, down to 0.06 from attempts  to short it. Every time I buy, it goes down, every time I sell, it goes up. I suspect that BTC truly traces my moves and determines the market price by doing the exact opposite of what I do. It would be comic if it weren't tragic. All I want in this world is to get back to my .1, haha.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:53:27
Only thing I learned from all of this is that the people who actually have a clue of what is going on are likely not wasting their time posting on reddit.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:38:38
I mean, you are right about that. I was just stating that, yesterday when all this crap wasn’t going down, the people who actually know what they are doing, were likely not the ones here. Might have come out wrong, sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:44:12
I guess I can at least say that I learned something. Just certainly upsetting to see what could be worth about 1.600 USD right now only be worth about 150 USD more than what I actually started with. But, at the end of the day, at least I didn't lose money, just potential for making more. 
I have been trying to be more mindful of the holding idea now, but I swear: GDAX tracks me. 
Right this second the price is 16350. Want to be a dime that I can make that go down? All I have to do is buy back in, hahaha

You are obviously me in a slightly parallel universe.
Sometimes I'm led to believe that the guy that created the hole HODL thing just sucked at day trading, like us. Which in that case, HODL is staring to make sense...
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:41:04
Me neither; which is why I was here yesterday.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:48:10
Let me know when you need a crash and I will be there.
That's the thing, I promised I'd stop doing anything once I got back to my .1. Unforunately I said that at .08, at 0.07, and more recently, at 0.06. Soon enough I will be officially losing money with this, so I guess all I can do is stop for now.
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:40:25
But wouldn't people normally only send BTC to the same address?
like, let's say I work for you, and you pay me in BTC monthly. Would I have to constantly give you new keys, or could I use the same public key to receive from you forever?
As for the private key, I guess I need to do some more research. I was under the impression that each "wallet", even if it had multiple public keys, was really only tied to one private key, which is how you'd keep track of it. Seems like that is not the case from what you are saying?
"You made a backup of wallet.dat when you set it up
It contains the first 100 keys
Months later, after using all those 100 keys on pizza purchases, the wallet generates another 100 keys for many more months of pizza purchases"
Are these 100 keys public, then?
Thanks for the patience with me on these and for the thought out answers, mate!

Today shall be remembered as The Great Depression of December 17th. 
Not to be confused with The Great Depression of December 23rd, or the one on the 27th.

I am pretty new to all of this, but can try to answer what I know. Hopefully someone can fill in the gaps.
They do have a finite supply. I think the number is 21 million. Currently, if I am reading the charts correctly, some 16.7 million are available and changing from hand to hand as people buy and sell. The remainder is still being "mined", which is a whole another concept on its own, and I know nothing about other it other than that it is only viable with a very large investment and in countries where electricity is really cheap. 
HODL = Hold on for dear life, referring to the idea of not selling your BTC after you have bought them.
Hopefully I am not giving you the wrong information here, but I am sure someone will soon come and reply as well.

Absolutely relatable; proud owner of X% of a BTC here. 
Edit: being super secretive about the minuscule amount that I own after the backlash.

Not defending BofA because, well, screw the big banks; BUT, I have made all my purchases on Coinbase with my Checking account at BofA and never had that problem? Maybe you should try contacting corporate?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:31:12
Yep, sure have. Sold at 8400 hoping to buy back at 8200. I deserve the things that happen to me.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:58:04
Hope you hodl'ed until today to eat it; otherwise that's some $700 of cake you lost right there.
