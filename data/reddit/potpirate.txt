What do mean "used the seed words"?  Did you have to install firmware on the trezor the first time you plugged it in?  If you wrote the words down that the trezor itself displayed, you should be good.  If your trezor came with seed words already written down, i would move the coins ASAP.

That's the URL.  There is no advanced option on this invoice.  They say I need a wallet that accepts "Bitcoin Payment Protocol for this order".  Maybe your order didn't require that. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:00:22
If you're buying from an atm, you don't need coinbase at all.
Different brands of atms ask for different things. The one that I used earlier this year only ask for a cell phone number (for a sms verification) for amounts less than $800.  It wanted an ID scan for amounts greater than $800.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:01:10
Address is not a part of the url. It says, for my order, I must use a wallet that accepts "Bitcoin Payment Protocol".  I've never heard of that. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:03:14
Depends on what country you're in. You'll have to verify your info and link a bank account to receive fiat. It's not going to be a quick process your first time.

I feel like when I bought a steam game a while back it was the same as you say. 
However I've tried 3 different invoices now and it's just that url when I copy it. Probably due to being a $1300 order. 
Clicking the "how do I pay" link, bitpay says, "if you do not see a bitcoin address on a bitpay invoice, the invoice must be paid using the Bitcoin Payment Protocol.  The bitpay invoice displays a Payment Protocol URL or a Payment Protocol QR code instead of a bitcoin address".
I guess I was hoping it was something I was missing in trezor. Looks my only option is to transfer the funds to a wallet that does support the payment protocol and the paying from there. 
Sucks but I guess bitpay has their reasoning.   Thanks for looking at my post though!

I told a couple coworkers, they put $50 in. I'm helping? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:41:44
They all want your ID. Try localbitcoins or find an atm that only does sms verification. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:46:20
I misread what you wrote.  I'll try to resubmit the order and see if the address is in there. Thanks

I see. Thanks for the explanation. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:48:49
It's for an entire pc build so that's not the issue.  Another user said the address may be a part of the url so I'll check that out.
I'm pretty sure I checked every thing I could on the invoice though. There is an address area that you can click and it copies to clipboard but it's just a url not an actual btc address. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:38:09
I've tried looking around the invoice.  They do not list a receive address.  Only a url or qr code that have both the address and amount in it.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:36:44
Yes, from what I've read the URL is the receiving address and also the payment amount. 
Seems like bitpay won't just give an address because they don't want you to send from an exchange.

May I ask why he didn't have any bitcoin already?  To know so much about it but to have not invested previously is confusing.

Thanks man. Had to use electrum instead of trezor.io. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:12:43
Choosing the scan option is just a qr code that is the same url.  Which isn't recognized by trezor.

Change your default fee to low-priotity then select max. If you select max first and then swith the fee, it sends the original max amount but with a lower fee, leaving a little behind.

Gemini puts a 5 day hold on ACH transfers. If you transfer before the 5 days is up, you gotta wait another 5 days. This can lead to your coins being on hold for a while.

Maybe switch to beans and rice. The kind in big bags. It's more kitchen work but you'll get more nutrition for your money.
