I have next to no money but have been waiting to find a simple way to get into BTC and not download the blockchain.  Bought my first BTC today.  I'm already down $27.50 and I am one happy boy :)

A.5- mass-adoption with significant (not huge) price increase.  Although seriously, won't they be mutually inclusive?

accept- apologies, I am not a grammar nazi but that distinction alters the entire point of your statement

I like this idea.  I'm not qualified to do it or else I would.

If BTC was a 'company or business', this would be a windfall-in-your-lap.  One of my favorite aspects of BTC is watching it grow through the passion, ideaology, and activism of it's adopters.  There is no marketing from BTC itself- just its users and the companies that develop around the platform.

Damn.  Now that is something to consider and, if valid, shows how vulnerable BTC can be if the PTB want it STFD.
