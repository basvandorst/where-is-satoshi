There’s a demographics change to consider. The 2008 bust in real estate coincided with a bunch of boomers becoming empty nesters and downsizing with no good household formation yet occurring among millennials and Xers being a smaller cohort with all the house they needed thanks. 10 years on, millennials are doing a lot more household formation and moving toward peak earning years. And that leads to buying houses. They have a demographic size similar to boomers so demand has shifted considerably to the right. Instances of subprime and gotcha loans, while occurring, are much more the exception than the rule.

Banks are going to adopt crypto themselves. Why? Because there is a huge market of people that would want to invest in crypto but don't know much about it, don't want to spend time on it, are afraid of losing their keys, afraid of being hacked, afraid of not able to control their emotions, etc. They will gladly hand over their money to banks like they do with stocks, to let other people invest for them. Banks are completely stupid if they don't take advantage of this potential market. This is what's going to happen within 3 to 5 years, when most of the milennium generation will enter the labor market and won't be so scared of new ways to invest like the older generation. They will be accustomed to crypto. So no, banks will not go away, neither will crypto. The biggest enemy of crypto will adopt it themselves and secure their existence by doing so.
