If Bitmain Collapses, what happens to people who bought their miners and are using them to mine?  will they still be able to mine Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2019-03-26 03:57:24
you are not too late to the party... I first thought I missed the boat in 2012/13 when I tried mining on my PC. then thought I missed the boat when the price hit $1000 for the first time.
then again for the third time in 2017 I thought I missed the boat! 
truth is, once you learn about the technology behind BTC you realise this isn't a Ponzi scheme, and it's here to stay. buying now in the dip for the long term HODL is a good idea for anyone.

really nice! does anyone know where I can buy a coin like this to put some BTC on to give as gifts to people? seems like a nice novel way to get people interested in BTC. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 21:06:59
sounds like a SCAM to me!
@_date: 2019-03-28 05:08:38
yes they might lose them, and of course risk is there anyway. thats not what I asked was it...
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:27:37
I hope you bought them with Bitcoin :-p
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:13:52
yes... and buying a pair of Adidas shoes probably is the dumbest one I have heard yet. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:27:03
hehe. sorry. I wasn't trying to attack you/your shoes or your post. though having just re-read it, I sound like a dick. 
I am venting my frustrations, which has nothing at all to do with you or your post, I was just looking for a punch-bag. 
love the shoes...and PROMOTE away! ;)

congratulations! I am currently trying to save some bitcoin in order to buy one of your pieces... big fan of your work! have been eyeing some of the originals you have for sale on your website. all outstanding! keep up the good work... 
p.s come and paint something in China ;-p
@_date: 2019-02-10 19:37:05
seems you asked so politely... no I won't. and neither will Palestine!

"I am seeing bitcoins everywhere except in my wallet" &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2019-02-01 00:40:57
I am hoping the bear market can continue a while longer... nearly got 1 BTC now. happy days ;-D

I am really sorry to hear about your and others losses using Coinomi... 
wouldn't everyone who has lost their crypto on exchanges like these or MTGOX etc not have been better off investing in a hardware wallet? 
can someone ELI5 why do people keep their crypto on an exchange?
if I wanted to sell my bitcoin, isn't it just as easy to do directly from a hardware wallet than from your electronic wallet? (I struggle to understand WHY people keep so many crypto coins on exchanges or on electronic wallets)
@_date: 2019-02-03 00:35:29
why the push for anonymity when buying bitcoin? is it mostly for tax purposes? or simply so that holding a store of wealth can be anonymous? 
I could theoretically give someone cash whom I know buys/sells bitcoin and just have them transfer bitcoin into my hard/soft wallet right? 
would this keep everything anonymous? (would it keep the amount of bitcoin I own anonymous even if I was making small deposits myself through my own account?) 
I recently finally figured out how to buy some bitcoin for myself, after a LONG time trying to figure it out. I also had to fill out all that KYC form and be 'authenticated' in order to buy...
sorry for the noob questions
@_date: 2019-02-12 03:04:52
thats really nice of them, and also a really nice coin! do you know how many they made? and what they are worth? 
@_date: 2019-02-27 08:01:52
not sure why you bothered to come here to post this comment... 
@_date: 2019-02-10 20:24:25
"Boy Bitcoin" ??? what's that supposed to mean??? 
@_date: 2019-02-12 02:59:29
what other projects specifically are you talking about? can you give us a few examples...tnx
@_date: 2019-02-03 15:11:35
wow. thanks for taking the time to write up such a great and detailed response. I guess my biggest question regarding anonymity and tax involves my parents and their will.
with the UK there is up to a 40% inheritance tax... they are legally allowed to give a certain amount yearly to their kids. about £3000 without it being taxed. however anything above that is taxable...
I was under the impression my parents could just buy bitcoin and transfer whatever they wanted to my hard wallet without it being traced or tracked. but if we have both gone through a KYC verification this wouldn't be possible, or would it?

if you are going to post a link to an audio book... any chance we can get one that has't been edited? 
@_date: 2019-02-03 15:39:33
which is the best way to obtain/buy Bitcoin without the need to go through a KYC check? (thanks!) 
@_date: 2019-02-02 23:15:23
I feel for you my brother. stay strong. the world is slowly waking up to the plight of the Palestinian people. despite a massively controlled Jewish run media!
What you say is completely true. Unfortunately people outside of Palestine have been conditioned and brainwashed to the extent that a lot of them dare not even question what is happening in your country for fear of being ostracised or being labelled or called anti-Semite. 
hopefully we can build a future where we can all live together without the need for segregation, racism, hatred and extreme political thoughts. Bitcoin might help to build this future if we can rest the control of the power to print and make money away from privately owned central banks who pretty much hold the whole world to ransom over an ever increasing debt cycle and poverty.

can you possibly send an eBay link? or something? tnx ;)
@_date: 2019-01-25 11:31:15
ok bit of a noob question here (sorry if it is not applicable to this post) .... how come every post or comment I read on r/bitcoin is against BCH. and vice-versa. I never see any positive comments on r/btc regarding Bitcoin. do people buy/invest/believe in both at all? or is it strictly ONE or the OTHER? 
investing in Crypto is already difficult enough. I thought BCH was created as a Hard fork from BTC? (surely there will be some people who hold both in their portfolio? or am I wrong)
@_date: 2019-01-25 14:01:48
thanks for the detailed response. common sense would suggest that you may be on to something regarding the confusion that is being manifested with regard to calling themselves btc on reddit for example. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 18:57:00
so if I scan the barcode on the back... it will tell me in realtime the price of bitcoin? 
(that's pretty cool!) 
where are you selling them? 
@_date: 2019-01-25 13:29:14
hahaha. thanks for the link to r/buttcoin. and yes. I think your analogy rings true. it certainly seems that way to me when I read through various posts on both sides of the fence. 
I am yet to read many/any posters who advocate both haha. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 02:55:00
I hope it doesn't go to $5000 tomorrow... give me some more time to accumulate some COIN!
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:46:41
Thanks, thats what I thought....although I don't quite understand how a hard fork works, I understand the concept. (I think) 
does the limited transactions per second hinder BTC at all in comparison to BCH? or are both not a good investment? 
it seems that the lies and trolling are coming from both sides (more so from BCH IMO...) however with my limited knowledge I thought owning or holding a little of both would be a good investment? but reading the reddit comments I hardly ever see anyone who is an advocate of both. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 19:25:04
thanks for the link... and yes I will look for a cheaper one. lovely idea though!
