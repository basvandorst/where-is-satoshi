Ignorance mainly imo, but also because nothing is guaranteed, some would rather play it safe

I bought a little back at the China crash and made a decent profit when I sold it at $7k, so I am by no means a hodler. That being said I love watching the charts and following all news bitcoin and I respect you for your patience lmao

Definitely not trying to be a millionaire, but if easy money can be made then why not at least try? Do you have any recommendations on where to start? Would learning about straight up investing help me more than looking for info on bitcoin?

I like the enthusiasm cause it makes me happy about my decision, but it just seems too good to be true... what’s to stop another currency from leaving bitcoin in the dust along the way?

I’ll bet you my left nut it reaches 10k within the hour!

Was bitcoinmerch taken? 
Also imo, your homepage should be your about page with no product, and put a big fat button that says “Shop” under the about text. 
Just my feelings on it
