Yeah the brass token minted in China in 2014

Like this?   
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:58:28
Yeah, how much does one sealed funded one go for?

Couldn't agree more. In fact, it was proven that Chase bought up a major stake of Bitcoin after Dimon's comments. Complete manipulation and quite sad.

Touche. I updated it. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:14:30
We have had some on our website. Comes and goes though.  
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:13:19
Is this what you have? But 2011?

Good catch! Updated!
Notice I said "wants to crush". It won't happen.

Sure but if you are destroying the hologram of the coin just to get to the minority cryptocurrency (BCH in this case) due to the split, then you are significantly decreasing the value of the physical coin. 
So one could argue the minority crypto value doesn't matter much at all, and to ignore it would be highly recommended.

Totally agree those cards are probably worth destroying. Casascius, Lealana, MicroSoul and some other rarer coins, on the other hand, probably not.

Good feedback. Thanks.

 I trimmed it out based on your feedback. I'll probably keep some sort of intro in there but try to make it less satirical :)
@_date: 2017-09-18 17:59:19
Nope, and I don't think it ever will. But it is definitely volatile and will be a roller coaster ride up to $10k and beyond!

The whales run the show. You either swim alongside them or as far away as possible. Everyone else is just a minnow waiting to be swallowed up.

Absolutely. We're not out of the woods yet, but it's promising to see the response at the $2900 support line. That indicates that we likely won't fall to form the right shoulder...fingers crossed.

Well played!

Split or not, Bitcoin's value has remained so the physical coins retain their value and continue to rise as the value of Bitcoin rises.

Name a chase credit card and I will find you one that is just as great. They're all the same!
True, the CEO of the company doesn't speak for everyone because everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion and has his/her own voice. 
But the CEO actually does speak on behalf of JP Morgan Chase as a whole....so everyone.

Haha, just transfer the loan! Probably get better rates at a credit union :)
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:09:13
I know, it's a lot of work. Haha.
