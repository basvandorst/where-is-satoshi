Specific example,  and what it exemplifies aside,  this is a very powerful concept to understand...  Thanks for taking the time to explain!   It's easy to manage a number of other similar,  more moral use cases of this idea.

According to Twitter, he's already received $48.17 in tips. :)  Nice.

When are you going to support the obvious Indianapolis market? :)
I'll buy coin the day you go online!

Given the ratcheting up of the national dialogue and press, I think it will come to that.  She will be forced to show evidence, and I suspect that she will attempt to.
To me, she seemed nervous because she knows that she's now done something that can't be undone.  She's either ended her career or permanently outted the founder of Bitcoin.
I'm shocked that she didn't record the conversation.  I'm shocked that we haven't heard from the two police witnesses.

Bitcoin's challenge in EA will be finding ways to create businesses that are owned and conceived by east Africans.  There's a fairly strong civic pride around Safaricom and generally speaking, high happiness with mPesa.  Successful products will have to work alongside the Safaricom's of the world, not against them.

As someone who has spent over 10 years going back and forth to Kenya, and understanding the culture (and subcultures) there, this outcome is completely unsurprising to me.
I wouldn't be surprised at all that Safaricom felt threatened by this, and that strong-handed forces shut Kipochi down quickly once they understood what this was.  I don't know the business model underneath Kipochi, but if I were to guess... Kipochi's mistake was in not sharing the proceeds with Safaricom.
It's an affirmation that Bitcoin is disrupting pre-existing markets in healthy ways.  We're going to see a lot of these kind of "threatened powers fight back" type of stories.
Thanks for the link.

This is exactly where Bitcoin enthusiasts should get excited and hopeful, as you have someone with the stature of Bill Gates, both aware of Bitcoin, and with suggestions on what is further needed to solve use cases for the poor.  
This is where an open community really shines.  Instead of going into FUD mode, take his critical eye seriously, and adapt Bitcoin and/or the services on top of Bitcoin to respond to the shortcomings.
This seems like a good place to be, IMO.

The trading volume is low on most of this advance.  On all exchanges.
What do people make of this?

The costs of buying into this are extraordinarily high.
Beware and understand the facts before you invest there!
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:04:53
Not down to 2-4% which would be an understandable fee.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:07:18
I️ hope so.  :)

Wow.  I’m impressed.  This is a very important milestone for Bitcoin.

One of the best posts on this subreddit in some time.  Concern trolling or not, a lot of quality content to review and learn from.
Thanks one and all for dropping knowledge.  Pretty easy to triangulate truths if you read through everything.

Someone else on here pointed out a few days ago that 11600-700 was a technical resistance line.  While I can't show you a link to that myself, it's true that a "double-top" pattern might lead to a drop down to the bottom of the trading channel, which is ~mid 6ks.  So, I'm prepared for another big dip.

Would you be willing to share the charting that led to your comment?  It's clear based upon market action today that your analysis is accurate.

Brian Behlendorf is an accomplished technologist with substantive people skills to boot.  Good hire.

Because I want more, naturally. :)
I think we all know where bitcoin is headed long term... now, just want more opportunities to buy in. :)
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:15:54
I hope you're right.

Hard to know how to read the current market action.  If you look at it like a traditional stock, it seems highly, highly implausible to have such upside for so many days continuously.  At the start of the week, the price was $120 lower than it is now... 
OTOH, the price is influenced by so many markets.  Much of the action this week is coming from China, for example.  A lot of the action over the past month was coming from the US.  
There's no way to properly assess the fundamentals of bitcoin, either.
I dunno, obviously happy with the movement, but we're in unchartered waters here, IMO.

Someone had a bid for around 2200 bitcoins @ 222 on Bitstamp and this is driving the price up.
This is why you're seeing the current price action.  There's a lot of money on the sidelines (at least for now) that's willing to spend $222/bitcoin.

From your lips, to God's ears... I hope this graph plays out fully.

It's this... Notice that its leveled off...
