Haha thanks! Yep, we raised money to plant 100,000 trees in Africa and employ the villagers of a region of Madacascar. [They've already started planting!](

I've been around since late 2012 and can definitely see dogecoin succeeding. I'm roughly equally hedged in BTC and DOGE.

The point is that there have been multiple bubbles and bitcoin hasn't died after them. The same bitcoin detractors were around in April when it crashed from $270, and in August of 2012. If you don't think bitcoin has a future, then you're obviously in the wrong sub.

I've been using coinbase lately to sell BTC and put USD directly into my Wells Fargo account.  If you link your bank account, you'll have a 10 BTC per day (I think) buy limit.  Definitely the easiest way to buy bitcoins right now, at the cost of anonymity.

You can enable two-factor authentication on Coinbase, so that you have to verify a code on your phone before you can purchase a bitcoin.  I was worried about that too, but the whole authentication thing makes it slightly safer... in any case, I don't keep very much money in that particular account, just in case.  I transfer most of it into my main.  As ease of use goes, though, Coinbase is hard to beat.
