Haha omg 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:10:52
Is it possible to watch it now when the live stream is over?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:51:31
I'm taking my business elsewhere for good. I have no use of Coinbase anymore, since they won't implement segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:36:08
That makes two of us!
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:34:39
Second that!
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:38:20
You don’t seem to get my point. There are NO positive mentionings of Bitcoin at r/btc. It’s only shit posts about Bitcoin, which the mods over there allow. 
Funny enough that you should call it Bcash... It’s called Bitcoin Cash you know. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:56:18
That guy is smart as hell 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:33:07
Why would mods over at r/btc ban people shit talking Bitcoin? They love it I guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:35
Me too!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:44
Wild guess... Institutions buying in. What is going on right now is crazy. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:58:10
Thank you 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:52:12
I suggest we all make a post on r/Coinbase and tag all the mods and employees. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:30
19k now. I cannot believe this. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:25
17k is soon so last hour. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:39:03
Andreas is the real Bitcoin Jesus!
@_date: 2018-09-08 19:13:30
Thank you. So many people don't get this.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:43:20
Great feeling, huh? ;)
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:37:42
Yup, it blew through that resistance point. Next stop should be around 4631. Let's see how that goes
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:52:50
What the fuck, my Coinbase dashboard just showed error, haha
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:50:38
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:37:59
Coinbase is pretty accurate
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:36:09
Feels amazing ;)
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:31:46
Seems like it already did!
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:36:59
And in the apology video he refers to it as his ‘product’
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:46:08
Ah okay Thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:34:57
Can someone explain what the relation between this and Bitcoin hitting 10k is? Thanks :). 
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:29:07
Okay thanks :)
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:02:25
Exactly how I feel!
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:08:44
Exactly my point :P
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:38:07
Here you go: 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:03:27
He has much to apologize for ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:35:08
In the apology video, he actually called it his ‘product’
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:12:11
Wow that heading is misleading...
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:00:32
That is amazing news!
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:23:40
Will your device reset like with other leger updates? 
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:18:09
I guess they dont. Extremely sad to see
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:18:44
Seriously, this is the least intelligent comment I have heard in a very long time. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:17:14
Yea, you would almost have to assume so. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:40:46
Ah Thanks 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:12:53
