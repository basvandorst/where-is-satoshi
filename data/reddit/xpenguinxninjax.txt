told him i want a guarantee before i pay, spoke to two data recovery companies that specialize in decryption they both gave me quotes saying that the files are there and decryptable.   Ive tried myself( i work in it)  there are two levels of decryption  scarab crypto with extension .am and btcware payday with .wallet extension.  as far as i can tell ill never get it decrypted with the free decrypters (and yes i made a backup of the original encrypted files before i attempted decryption)

its hard to sit and wait when theres a business that already hasnt been able to open its doors for two weeks now.  recovery tool could be months before it comes out

this particular case was through a backdoor in windows server as far as i can tell.  Updates came in, and so did ransomware.  guess there was a security flaw.  The sites that identify the origin of it on your pc told me that it was through the guest account which was disabled.
