Absolutely.  PayPal will debit your bank account if your PP account has a negative balance.  Transferring to your bank has no bearing on the transaction being deemed 100% final.
Edit:  Safest method is (unfortunately) cash through an in-person transaction.

"I'll listen to what you guys have to say after I share the Church of Satoshi with you!"  Then preach the scripture of decentralization and slam the door.  They'd just be confused as fuck.

Sorry, I've never used Redbox. Do they keep your card info and charge you the cost of the disc, if you don't return it?  For Bitcoiners, I guess they would need us to overpay, hold the Bitcoin, then return the extra when the disc is returned. Guilty until proven innocent sucks, but at least it would mitigate their risk of accepting crypto.

Don't forget the costs associated with:
* investigating/prosecuting counterfeiters
* disposing and replacing worn currency
* fees for check cashing services, payroll cards,  and using non-network ATMs
Keep in mind these costs are disproportionate to those who need the money most (the poor and unbanked).  [Article](  Edit: typo

I came here to say the same thing.  Thanks, Zyoman.  Besides that... good survey, OP.

Is he based in the US?  A traditional exchange in the US (that allows advanced orders) might do well.  I think at the moment there is only CampBX?  What types of currency does he transact?
@_date: 2014-09-04 18:44:31
Absolutely.  Value is added when materials become goods.  I was just saying the resources needed to make many goods are fixed.  +was just saying goods can't be created out of thin air (but currency can).  So increasing the money supply dilutes the purchasing power of all existing currency.

If you live on the same planet as the rest of us, the resources needed to produce many goods are unfortunately finite.  Until mining other planets/asteroids becomes feasible.
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:27:24
Not really, because they only mine SHA-256.  Most of the popular alt-coins are Scrypt.  By definition, application-specific integrated circuits are only made to do one thing.  Sorry mate.  Leave it running to support the network (if you have free electricity).  Otherwise its a paperweight.
@_date: 2014-10-01 01:53:48
Good point.  If my grandma wanted to buy Bitcoin, I'd probably recommend the same thing (Coinbase or Circle + 2FA).  For mainstream users, trusting professionals is indeed better than trusting their own opsec.

We're glad to have you with us during this exciting time in human history!  Bitcoin is extremely easy to use and it really does take that first purchase for it to "click" for a lot of people.  That's fantastic you helped a non-profit benefit from the generosity of the Bitcoin community!  We need more positive people who see real benefits of cryptocurency.

That's what's great about Bitcoin.  You can use it however you want.  I don't think there is anything bossy about trying to spread "best practices" to new users.  Many Bitcoin users are paranoid when it comes to all aspects of IT security, so they are sure as hell paranoid when it comes to securing their private keys.  I don't think I really have a point.  I just think its better to not spread insecure storage practices.

There is no such thing as "left over" coins.  There are only hodled and non-hodled coins.

I like this idea.  We aren't going to get companies to accept Bitcoin overnight.  If we use the existing payment system in conjunction with BTC, we might get more companies to accept it.

A Satoshi is (currently) the smallest subunit of the currency.
* 1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshis
* 1 mBTC = 100,000 Satoshis
* 1 μBTC (bit) = 100 Satoshis

You articulated exactly what my dumbass couldn't.  Its like saying in the late 70s: *this TCP thing is a good idea but it won't be the defacto way to reliably move data over a network. I'm sure someone will come up with a better method.*

Coinbase and Circle use ACH, yo.  You don't physically send a check.  Both companies are generally held in high regard and you still have your bank to turn to (if a different amount than what you agreed to is debited from your account)
@_date: 2014-06-10 02:24:03
There is absolutely nothing wrong with spending Bitcoin.  Surely, set some aside for long-term saving but keep a hot wallet for spending from time to time.  This stuff is worthless if it isn't used for commerce.

*Never go full fiat.*  Words to live by.
@_date: 2014-09-19 04:49:20
Its decently fair, but definitely needs more liquidity.  Large buys and sells swing the price far too much at this point.  There are also pretty big splits between exchanges, which could indicate varying degrees of friction moving fiat in/out.
@_date: 2014-07-13 04:06:00
How do you plan on paying?  If you are meeting them in person and paying cash, its **very** unlikely anyone will be selling under market price.  The only people selling below market price will be whales unloading a lot of coin (most likely from the darknet).  Use common sense and definitely use escrow.
@_date: 2014-05-06 19:57:39
I agree 100%, I wouldn't pay that either.  But maybe they could also add a "trust level" for each user, so they would hold $20 the first 10 times, then after safely returning all 10 times, they would assume you are a decent person and not need a deposit.  Just an idea.  Obviously, people would still exploit the system.  That's why we can't have nice things.  :-/
@_date: 2014-09-26 21:25:42
Sorry to burst your bubble, but it will be hard to find someone willing to accept PayPal from a stranger online.  This is due to many scammers doing chargebacks (or whatever PP calls them).  The seller then has no type of recourse because Bitcoin transactions are only 1 way.

All stocks have pretty much been increasing in "zombie-mode" since 2012.  IMHO this is indicative of an expanding money supply and not caused by any real economic improvement.  Stocks are merely increasing with inflation (just like the prices of other good in the economy).  The dollar's days are truely numbered and the world is slowly realizing.
