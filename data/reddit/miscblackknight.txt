Umm, bitcoin is property and not a security according to the IRS and the SEC rules it a commodity (such as gold) and does not need to be disclosed unless held in a security such as a ETF or fund that invests in cryptos.

If you send coins to a BCash wallet it just creates a Bitcoin wallet with the same address. They don't go away

it's your debit card, if you tried to pick up a large amount you were hit with a fraud alert, call them and see.

Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash use the same address format. This means that if you take the key from your Bitcoin Core client, and import it to your Bitcoin Cash client, the Bitcoin Cash client will be able to spend that money. This means that you can't have a Bitcoin address belong to one person and a bitcoin cash address belong to a different person since they the same key for access

You do know that you are taxed on bitcoin gains right? Also it being a blockchain makes every purchase or transfer of bitcoin trackerable. So if they know your wallet they can pretty much track you better than they do now lol.

You pay taxes because the men with guns say you have to, it's not a moral choice for most of us.

I sold right at 8k, going to rebuy at 7.5k if it hits that low.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:04:21
do you sell at an exchange or buy at one? Do you do it from a bank account or a CC? If so the IRS wants and will have your info, the problem is not bitcoin it's the way their distribution is setup. Look at the lawsuit Coinbase is going through with the IRS right now, they pretty much already warned their users to watch out as the IRS will have cost basis information and blockchain information of the transaction (coins can be tracked from transfer to transfer)

Yep it is a taxable event, same as if you bought gold at 900 and sold at 1400, etc..
