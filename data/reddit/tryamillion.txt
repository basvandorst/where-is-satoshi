You just know that the governments will start putting their money into bitcoin, at least a small portion, and then bitcoins price will shoot to the moon, forget doge.

Best tip... don't keep all your eggs in one basket. It does take time to learn but you don't have to learn much to get started. Can get caught up in the technical aspects.

These are still interesting points, but highlights also the truth. In today's world with payment processors, none of them work together, so if you are with one, you can't transfer to another and is same as the early days of computers.
What bitcoin and other crypto currencies provide the world is that interconnection. How would it be like if you was with gmail but you couldn't email yahoo mail addy's. Bitcoin then gives us that open view which is needed in todays world. Yes there are concerns, but the benefits far outway the negatives. The same could be said about snail mail, the internet, computers and even bitcoin. Overall the benefits far outway the negatives.

It is a good thing and glad to see it implemented. The world is moving more and more forward to bitcoin and protecting everyone from market manipulation is always important. Good to see a positive view to help investors and people have a secure environment with bitcoin.

Very true. I think games like RuneScape could help when they have taken efforts to stop bots. Keep in mind it also benefits btc because it protects it from those trying to do bad to it, but yes, how do you implement it. Even with forex, stocks, and other tradables, bots are always an issue, price fixing an issue, etc. Overall it made the news so I guess the purpose of getting in the news worked for the CFTC?
