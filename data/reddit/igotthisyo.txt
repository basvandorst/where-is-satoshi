Coinbase is showing me two different prices. $11,020 for bitcoins price but when I click buy and enter the amount it shows the buy price at $11,075. Has anyone else noticed this difference? Is there a reason for this?

Yeah I was thinking the exact same thing. Definitely sounds just like ghee
@_date: 2018-09-05 03:56:08
Pretty sure ghee was trolling people on this sub. He even mentioned that that was his intention. So if that’s what he was trying to do then he deserves it. He can express his opinion but to try to rile people up for his personal enjoyment will gain no sympathy from me for being banned.

I think this is barely even profitable, if at all depending on your electricity cost. Just an overclocked s9 with water cooling and a radiator. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:34:49
We know what your opinion is... You say the same thing in every post. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:47:27
Hardly a fan. 
It’s hard to miss when you spam it throughout the daily discussion. I don’t think people really care for your opinion as much as you might think, so there’s really no need to keep copying and pasting the same comments over and over.
@_date: 2018-08-30 08:16:37
Really shows how uninformed he is that he had no idea about difficulty changes.
He’s just trolling everyone. Must have lost a lot of money and he’s taking it out on this sub.

I’m confused as to what your issue is. Why are you buying bitcoin if you don’t need it?
Edit: use a credit card maybe? Cash advance? Do you not have any money at all?  I don’t think most ways will let you withdraw immediately with just your bank account information. I think they want to make sure your ach transfer goes through.
@_date: 2019-03-02 19:02:53
This guy is a scammer btw. He’s having a conversation with himself using multiple accounts.
@_date: 2018-10-30 22:23:46
You go to your bank and take out cash. Then you go to a bitcoin atm and buy bitcoin with that cash.

Bitmain just released new firmware to activate AsicBoost for S9s. S9i’s and S9j’s will have the same firmware released next week. Early reports are it improves power efficiency by 10-15%, possibly more. For now it only works on btc.com pool and Antpool but Slushpool is working on adding support.
@_date: 2018-10-23 08:57:43
This is a confirmed scam site. Don’t buy from here
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:39:56
And we’re still not done. Yet another account hacked by the scammer ^ u/Peglegninja
@_date: 2018-11-05 16:11:29
This sounds scammy. You need to be the person receiving the transfer and you would go to a western Union location, present the correct information and get your money. I assume just having a tracking number is not enough. Which makes it sound like the transfer is not yours. Then you would take that cash and buy your bitcoin. There’s no way to directly use a western union mtcn to buy bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-11-20 04:02:13
No offense but I can’t really understand this guys points. He’s just rambling a stream of consciousness. He barely even touched on what Bakkt is...
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:49:24
Lol dude you’re using the same fake/hacked accounts you’ve used to shill your scam site gominebit. You’re a fuckin moron. You think people will trust this shit just because you put [Trusted]... You’re even dumber than I thought.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:54:03
Anyone who wants to know if gominebit or this mixer site is a scam can ask u/insdrb03 about his experience purchasing from them.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:51:01
Just trying to warn people about your scam site so I won’t be fucking off... I’ll be in every post of yours warning people.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:30:24
Btw 
Check your accounts they’ve been hacked by this scammer.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:16:52
Definitely a scam. Run by the same guy shilling his scam site gominebit.com Look at all the fake accounts he’s using to vouch that it’s legit LOL �� It even has [Trusted] in parenthesis. Guess the bitcoin mining scam site isn’t working out so well for you huh?
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:10:45
This is a scam site. You will lose your money.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:39:22
And yet one more account hacked by the scammer ^ u/ShakeWell14
@_date: 2019-01-01 00:00:55
You must have copied it from somewhere? You should know where you copied it from.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:38:04
Account hacked by scammer ^ u/sirhitech 
@_date: 2019-01-01 09:15:29
The voyager exchange is legit. It just hasn’t launched yet which is maybe why you have to wait. Like you said it’s founded by one of the guys who started Uber. I think giving away bitcoin like this is good way to increase adoption. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:38:28
Another account hacked by the scammer u/gkrules
@_date: 2018-11-16 02:23:04
You can’t send bitcoin to a bank account. You need to either send it to a wallet, keep it in your exchange wallet (not recommended), or sell it for dollars and send those to you bank account. You need to research a bit more on wallets. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:38:54
And another account hacked by the scammer ^ u/supbro21
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:05:49
I won’t go away as long as you continue to try and scam people. Gominebit is a scam site that steals people’s money just like your new “mixer” you have here. No way am I going to be polite to a criminal scum like yourself.

I run my own mining farm and I can say it's pretty rough to be a miner right now. There have been a large number of miners shutting down and exiting the market, at least temporarily, because of the drop in price. You can see this in the most recent drop in mining difficulty. It was the second largest drop in difficulty in Bitcoins history. It was largely overdue as difficulty kept rising unsustainably even as the bear market continued to get worse. It is finally starting to come back down. Difficulty will adjust up or down as miners turn on or shut down which will always make it profitable for some people to mine. I imagine it will continue to drop even further with the next adjustment.
The cost to mine 1 bitcoin will vary between miners and has largely to do with their cost of electricity.  I think just guessing based on my rates if you're paying anything above maybe $0.07 per kWh it is probably no longer profitable to mine. At $0.06 per kWh I'm barely mining at a profit. You also have to figure in other costs like rent, internet, insurance, investors and other overhead a miner has to pay. It's going to be a rough next few months for us. I'm a little nervous about how long this bear market will last. All I can do at this point is hunker down, cut costs, and just keep mining what I can until it becomes no longer profitable to do so. Praying for a recovery in 2019.

Apparently they are, at least every time you exchange from one crypto to another is considered a taxable event by the IRS unfortunately. It makes it incredibly complicated. There is proposed legislation to change this though.

Here’s a video that does a good job visually explaining hashes and blockchain and a little bit about miners.

It sounds like his book is about arguments like these regarding what income can be taxed...
I would be careful about trying any of those arguments.

Article says it was a car accident.

Yeah it’s definitely a scam. Sorry bro but your coins are gone.
