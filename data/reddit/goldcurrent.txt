And at least Rand was against the TPP, unlike Johnson.
@_date: 2016-04-14 18:47:08
Good question. Now you know why this fucking state is 400 Billion bucks in the hole.
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:16:22
They're working on it
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:48:42
Very cool but not very mobile friendly.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:28:42
The more sensationalistic, the better for the msm and their zombie audience.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:19:26
That correction is going to sting a bit..
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:36:04
Meanwhile BTC Diamond pumps up to 130%.
No manipulation whatsoever, right?
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:44:06
Dont forget that incorrect breathing can also cost you your Paypal account.
@_date: 2014-06-06 18:24:40
I disagree and really wouldn't want a one world government. One size will never fit all.
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:38:16
A little late but fuck it, whatever. It can only be a good thing.
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:42:00
Not a big fan of KYC.
@_date: 2018-05-16 01:59:32
The biggest threat to USD was and still is the Federal reserve.
@_date: 2014-05-29 01:21:36
I believe I've seen this mentioned on a few of the "BTC scam sites" to avoid sites.
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:49:31
I could be wrong here but it could be a manipulation strategy to buy it up 'on the cheap'
@_date: 2014-10-05 02:23:46
Still better than the current DOW bubble.
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:18:45
Taxing a decentralized currency goes to show you how desperate DC is getting, now that it's $17 Trillion in the hole and about to lose the USD as the world's reserve currency.
@_date: 2014-04-25 06:14:39
Do you have their "damn quick pay" thing enabled?
@_date: 2014-05-08 09:10:40
Are you fucking kidding me?
@_date: 2014-03-11 23:38:42
Yuck.. 'regulatory protections' like the banks gave us when they crashed the global economy in 2008? I feel safer already.
@_date: 2014-11-24 21:24:33
Bullshit claim unless they own the English language.
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:59:20
It should say 'Virtual currencies threaten to end austerity and Fiat slavery due to central bankers and their puppet European governments'
@_date: 2014-05-27 22:46:38
How much more funding do you need to research CBD?
@_date: 2014-12-09 08:59:14
So glad we have politicians to tell us the obvious.
@_date: 2014-05-18 20:20:11
Relatively stable in the 435-450 range though. We haven't seen very wild swings in quite a while :)
@_date: 2014-10-17 19:58:56
Government overbloat at its finest.
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:32:09
Definitely a buying opportunity :)
@_date: 2015-05-23 04:59:05
I never said I was a fan of Republicans.
@_date: 2015-05-22 23:03:30
California sucks. No wonder its bankrupt.
@_date: 2015-05-22 23:31:58
Billions. 
@_date: 2014-10-12 03:50:58
Jamie Dimon belongs in prison.
@_date: 2015-05-23 04:15:35
No shit but all are Dem controlled and bankrupt, to spell out the obvious.
@_date: 2015-05-23 02:55:52
Right... Look at cities like Baltimore and Detroit. Complete toilets even after getting bailed out.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:00:09
EU: Unelected bureaucrats.
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:14:23
Funny. We don't need them.
@_date: 2016-06-24 06:35:35
Freedom, sovereignty and independence are not "xenophobia".
If you'd ask me, they've been pretty damn good hosts, even to people that hate Western culture.
@_date: 2016-06-13 05:21:54
Some are right on the edge, all over again..
I guess we'll see. :)
@_date: 2016-06-24 06:36:36
You mean regressive, trendy fucks. Glad remain lost.
@_date: 2018-10-18 18:11:20
They're coming around though
@_date: 2017-01-14 19:39:29
Yeah, they did a great job in Ukraine.
@_date: 2018-10-18 18:09:47
I agree. The next financial crisis will be worse and guess what, even subprimes are back!
At least we will have BTC and cryptos next time around.
@_date: 2017-01-14 19:35:07
NATO is a cold war dinosaur.
@_date: 2016-12-23 23:38:38
So what?
@_date: 2018-06-10 16:56:51
Are you serious?
@_date: 2018-06-02 05:31:01
Yet we do it voluntarily, every April.
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:50:23
Haven't done your homework on the PMs market have ya?
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:00:38
It was aliens.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:51:15
And yet nobody can reach an agreement on anything to scale it. BTC transaction times and fees right now are a fucking joke and the market is talking loud and clear.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:22:45
Unless he uses shapeshift, the trade will stall for days and ultimately fail. Lol
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:42:12
lol that must be nice. I've got about 2 weeks to go on mine. (Leaving Coinbase) :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:45:52
Onward to 10k we go!
@_date: 2015-07-21 02:07:55
Thanks dude :)
@_date: 2016-09-13 20:48:59
@_date: 2018-11-11 19:56:58
It simply isnt possible to pay off the national debt. Ever. Don't be surprised if the FED is either ended or nationalized at some point.
The US needs to regain control over its own curency.
@_date: 2016-09-30 16:32:38
Those were the tax paying citizens you felt then, as they realized the "bail-ins" are going to fuck them even more.
@_date: 2018-02-28 03:11:10
Too bad Apple hasn't done anything in crypto for him to rip off.
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:57:24
You mean trial not trail, right?
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:01:31
Its all about propping that petro dollar.
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:01:58
Thanks for your role in 2008, asshole.
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:45:40
The Rothschild banks have been a threat to humanity for far too long. Thank god for BTC and cryptos.
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:33:22
And how can we spin this into a CDO and fuck everyone with it later?
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:30:12
Yes, it did luckily. Just took a few days of running it non stop.
Hang in there! It'll happen eventually. :)
@_date: 2018-03-19 08:05:40
Because the guy driving you also needs to eat.
@_date: 2018-07-25 03:20:26
EOS and Tether are scams.
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:14:43
Well, they think they have jurisdiction over decentralized digital currency not issued by them, don't they?
@_date: 2015-04-24 02:52:14
In other words, the way it was meant to be.
@_date: 2018-02-21 06:54:47
Paypal can eat a dick and die. The world is moving on.
@_date: 2015-04-10 05:04:22
Paypal still sucks.
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:10:41
We wuz bankz
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:44:48
I think you're generalizing to describe a faux Libertarian.
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:47:48
Just ONE of MANY.
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:41:51
So with Wall st. itself in a bubble, how large a factor is the BTC ETF now?
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:07:31
Dashcoin or Dash?
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:58:43
Pondering what "didn't bought" means... ^^^
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:48:08
There is a photo of him with his address in the article. :)
@_date: 2016-07-08 06:54:00
These cars are engineered a hell of a lot better than your "point a to point b" Toyota Corolla. That includes safety.
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:02:37
The Rothschild banking stranglehold on global wealth needs to end now.
@_date: 2017-06-10 23:40:22
You're lucky. I've been waiting 8 days
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:02:42
Her handlers sure do.
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:15:47
I've been waiting 3 weeks for a transaction to clear.
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:08:08
And wait a fucking week for the trans to confirm. LMAO
