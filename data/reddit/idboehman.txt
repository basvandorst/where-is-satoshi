Look I understand and get what you're saying but the way you say it makes it seem like you view sex workers as sub-human creatures.

So could any other woman.

Whatever you say buddy.

Glitches happen sometimes

It wasn't funny to begin with.

You're the one circle jerking about magic Internet money.

I'm waiting for the collapse of civilization / fiat

Go fuck yourself, markets are bullshit.

lmao I'm just waiting for the crypto bubble to pop and you all to an hero
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:22:48
Get fucked you salty speculating investor, ETH is more interesting technology than bitcoin. You shouldn't be "investing" in crypto anyways.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:17:01
Lmao fuck off dipshit, you can't just define a word as whatever you want.

Investment assumes you'll trade it for fiat wealth at some point. I'm not "investing" in toothpaste or pickles when I buy a lot when I go to Costco.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:55:49
I have some btc and ETH I mined ways back, I just think you're all ridiculous for considering it an investment.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:21:47
Suck a fuck
@_date: 2016-09-03 14:37:57
An ethereum smart contract/decentralized app/DAO could do so, though I don't know if it could interop with bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-03 23:36:04
I wasn't talking about "TheDAO", I was talking about the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization.
@_date: 2016-09-04 00:41:25
You're still a dick. I recognized my mistake and admitted it, but you'll still be an asshole.

[this was literally just posted here yesterday.](
@_date: 2016-09-04 00:15:01
Too late, you're already a condescending dick. I understand there's no oversight *after* the money's distributed, but up to that point a decentralized app/DAO solves the issue at hand.
EDIT: Well fuck I just re-read the statement I initially replied to and you're right. My bad.
@_date: 2016-09-04 00:10:19
You're right, but even Kickstarter/etc can't necessarily guarantee that, though there's more than one you'd get with a DAO. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:01:14


How is that ironic?
@_date: 2017-07-11 06:58:23
Shiiiit. Looks like I'm rewatching the trilogy.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:45:58
Or at least act like it.
