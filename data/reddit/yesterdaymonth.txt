How is literacy regarding Bitcoin there? Are people running their own nodes, are they in control of their own keys or are they just using custodial wallets from centralized exchanges?
What is the main hardware they use to interact with Bitcoin is it laptops/desktop or phones?
Are Bitcoin mining fees an issue or is it just priced in?
@_date: 2019-03-02 20:14:19
People think that because the pioneers created and popularized the "wallet" and "coins" metaphor.
@_date: 2019-03-11 12:29:34
But in order to get new addresses from the ledger live you need to have your hardware wallet in hand to confirm the addresses.
@_date: 2019-03-07 23:31:54


I guess that depends on what we use the term "custodial" for. The most common use of the word I've seen in crypto is in reference to private keys. But yes if you increase it's definition to include public keys and other identifiers, I'd agree with you that openode is a custodial service.

That isn't a public key but a bitcoin address. In the Bitcoin Ledger amounts of btc are assigned to addresses an you can have how many you need. It is recommended to create a new one for each transaction for security and privacy sake.  Take a look at [bitcoin.page]( It's a great resource.

You can download a wallet that doesn't require to download the 200GB of data. I suggest [electrum]( [Bitcoin.org]( has other wallet suggestions.
Download electrum, run it and it'll probably prompt you to create a wallet. Create it and save the seed words. After you're done with that go to the menu File&gt;Open this wallet.dat file you have found. It'll ask you for the passphrase and that should do it.
**DO NOT TRUST ANY TEXT REQUIRING TO UPDATE THE WALLET.** Always go to the site to download updates. And if you have trouble sending your transaction you can just create it, sign it and go to  [ and paste the transaction there instead
@_date: 2019-03-15 13:14:13
I may be wrong but it's probably referencing the transaction from which you're spending the outputs.

All that running a node provides you with is your own copy of the blockchain you can access without trusting third parties like [blockstream.info]( or [bitaps.com]( So you won't have to request information from their servers and share your identifiers.
To buy and sell bitcoins you have to trade your fiat/goods/services with someone else. And running your own node doesn't in any way have a part in this.
Finally, you can "store your coins" also without running a node. There are hardware wallets and wallets app for smartphones and pcs.

Usually, but not always, when a transaction has two outputs, one is the "payment" and the other is the "change" going back to whoever made the payment. Also the miner's fee isn't one of the outputs. You can see it in the explorer's details but it isn't considered an output.
The number of confirmations is in how many blocks that transaction has been included. It doesn't necessarily mean how many blocks after the transaction was sent because the transaction can spend sometime in the mempool (waiting line) before being included in a block.

Surprisingly enough I think basic IT work will still be relevant. I was under the impression that the layman population would essentially die off but, from my personal experience, they're multiplicating.
This is anecdotal but it's incredible the amount of teenagers I come across that don't understand whatever OS they work in (windows or mac). Simple stuff like knowing how to browse through the folders. Recently I had a kid having trouble putting some files on a usb stick and at first I thought there was something wrong with the usb. Then they tell me they didn't know what to do and it took me a solid minute to believe what they meant. These kids grew up with smart phones and it's like they know how do anything else on a pc is browsing youtube and whatever social media they have.
In no way I think these are the majority but I'm still surprised they exist at all.

The best way you could go about is to study public donations addresses like this one for Andreas Antonopoulos  1andreas3batLhQa2FawWjeyjCqyBzypd
And in his case there is a rich history of transaction. However he's very technically capable so I don't know what you can gather from his transactions. He probably manages his coins on the output level. It's possible however that he uses this address to make donations to other causes so maybe if you could gather like the top 1000 donation addresses floating around you could get some relevant graph. You'd probably need to filter for regular transactions and discriminate towards older addresses.
PS: In Andreas case for example you can infer somethings about his spending habits from what he's said publicly about his cold storage practices, preference of segiwt over legacy, usage of mixing tools, etc. Back in the end of 2017 he received some large donations to this address so that may be an interesting starting point for what you're after.

The way the Bitcoin protocol works you have to spend all of your output. Let's say it's 2009, I'm a miner and I've just received a 50 btc output for mining the latest block and I want to send you 1 btc. The way it works is that that 50btc output will be used as input for this new transaction and it'll be split into two outputs: one of 1btc for you and another one of 49btc minus fees back to one address I specify. Previously you had to specify this "change" amount and address. Because if you didn't the change would be interpreted as miner fee. But nowadays wallets do it automatically and to an address that you control but that is different from the one associated with the 50btc output in this case.
About confirmations. Let's say I send a transaction after block 11 has been mined. Depending on the amount of transactions on the mempool (waiting to be included on a block) and the fee I chose, it can take a while for my transaction to be included in a block. So blocks 12, 13, 14 can be filled with transactions that were ahead of mine and leave my transaction on the mempool. Finally, my transaction is included on block 15. Now I have one confirmation but it was published 4 blocks ago. From the moment it has been included in a block, every new block that is mined is another confirmation.

1. An ASIC is Application-specific integrated circuit. These are used by miners to do bitcoin's proof of work as they are more efficient that CPUs and GPUs
2. It's written in the protocol that whoever solves the proof of work can print a constrained amount bitcoins to themselves.
3. Yes to the most part.
4. The merchant provides you with an address to which they possess the private keys and can check if you've sent bitcoins to them. [Bitcoin.org]( is site for Bitcoin (BTC). [Bitcoin.com]( is the site for Bitcoin Cash (BCH ABC), an altcoin. There's no "official" site to Bitcoin. You can buy Bitcoins online on [Exchanges](
5. Let's say that in Bitcoin you have accounts. These accounts have **private keys** that allows whoever is possession of them to spend them and **public keys** that are converted into **addresses** that are shared to receive bitcoins. If someone gets your **private keys**, they'll get access to your bitcoins.
6. Refrase this question please.
7. I'm not sure what is the most popular but yes you can let someone else have the private keys to your bitcoins and store them for you. Most exchanges provide this service to you. It's very dangerous though. The best solutions is to learn store them yourself. If it isn't a big amount you can use an app like Electrum on your phone. If it's a big enough amount consider an Hardware Wallet like Trezor or Ledger

Yes, people often talk about "Bitcoin's value" meaning the Bitcoin Protocol or the Bitcoin Network. And it's rarely clear which one.
I'd say the Bitcoin Protocol is priceless just like the Bittorent protocol or many other internet protocols. It's so revolutionary and useful that it's hard to put a price on it. The parts that make the Network are much more easily evaluated quantitatively.

Multi-to-one is quite simple when you control all private keys. Wallets do it automatically. But I don't see how strangers would be able to do it without coordination. If my understanding of bitcoin is correct, it could be done.
Let's say we're 5 people at a dinner and the bill comes at 0.05btc. Assuming that the fee will be 0.0000125, the first person can possibly crate a transaction spending 0.0100025 (0.00999 to the merchant + 0.0000125 for the fee) sign their outputs, then "pass" around the transaction and have the other at the table add their 0.00100025 and sing it. Then the last person would broadcast the transaction.
It seems cumbersome.

Skepticism is very good.
Lets try to get away from crypto. Maybe it'll make things easier. I don't know if you're into sports. But lets picture an institution like the NBA which is worth some billions. What you're suggesting is to clone its protocol: the number of players, the rules of the game, hell even the jerseys' logos. And what you're taking for granted is that if you were to offer a share in this company to investors they'd jump in in the hopes that one day it would be worth billions. 
But it wouldn't. You wouldn't get the players to play the game, you wouldn't get the  fans to pay for tickets, you wouldn't get merchants trying to sell food at the games or merchandise outside your stadium, tv channels paying for the rights to broadcast the games, etc.
Look if you're able to clone the bitcoin core implementation, some desktop and mobile light clients, some hardware wallets, convince some exchanges to list your bitcoin-clone, merchants to  accept it, and a mining difficulty that's proportionate to its value I guess yes you would've successfully created a viable bitcoin clone.
But that's the hard part. And I don't think you've grasped that. But give it some time and try to think in detail about your vision and hopefully you'll start to see cracks in it and understand why it doesn't work and why it hasn't worked in the last ten years.

Theoretically, I'd say yes. 
If my understanding of bitcoin is correct, every time you send a transaction with multiple inputs, what you're doing is using the private keys of those inputs to sign the transaction. So if you have the private keys of those inputs/outputs you should be able to write a raw transaction combining both utxos and paying the miner's fee only once.  Can't help you with the details on how to do it though. And how big or urgent is your transaction that 11k sats aren't enough?

There's the Bitcoin Ledger, the Bitcoin Protocol and the Bitcoin Network. The bitcoin protocol is very valuable because it provides you with a immutable, decentralized and distributed ledger that allows you send value all over the world in a permission less manner. Everybody participating in this protocol is part of the Bitcoin Network: hodlers, traders, exchanges, merchants, miners, developers, etc.
Although you can easily clone the protocol and the ledger, you can't clone the network. And that's where most of the value is located. Also you wouldn't increase the Bitcoin supply because you wouldn't be part of that ledger.

You can convert an integer to its hexadecimal with this [ and then use that hexadecimal as a private key on [
Alternatively, after you get the integer in hexadecimal you can follow those 8 steps using an online sha256 tool. Just google it.

First of all, do not share your private keys with anyone.
1.Most bitcoin wallets have a "Export keys" or something similar. Depending on the wallet, it'll give you the mnemonic phrase or a long string and a qr code. You should get that for the btc address that you sent the funds to.
2.I'm not familiar with bch wallets, but most btc wallets allow you to import that private key. It can be phrased in different manners: sweep funds, import private key, import account. Try to find that and paste the private key you got from step 1 there.

Try to sweep the private key of the btc address to where you sent the bch into your bch wallet.

Theoretically? Yes, I guess. But it's hard for me to see an identical protocol amassing equal network. You'd probably wouldn't get any participants from Bitcoin on that network simply because there'd be no incentive to do so. And neither everybody else in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. So you'd need to find developers, miners, exchanges, users, etc outside this space willing to invest in such protocol. Can't much people willingly joining it.
Maybe if some country or group of countries like the EU forced their citizens to participate in this Bitcoin² and have everybody have an asic connected to their router and only institute BTC² as their fiat and the only legal tender to pay taxes with. Maybe? But the more I think about this scenario the more ridiculous it becomes.

I suppose there are ways to write something to send btc automatically but that requires a hot wallet. And may be somewhat insecure. It's probably best to manually send the btc one would want send.

The [btc.com]( wallet is a 2-out-of-3 multisig wallet where the client gets two private keys and [btc.com]( keeps 1. It's designed for noobies who can't safely store their keys. By default they'll sign the transactions automatically, but if they algorithm notices odd behaviour they won't sign the transactions. In this case the client can use the other private key to sign the transactions.  
The problem here is that the client lost one of their private keys. The good news is that [btc.com]( can't steal the funds with only one key and as long the client doesn't lose another private key, they'll be able to have access to the funds.
@_date: 2018-12-26 17:20:10
Just in case. I don't know how new you are to bitcoin. This may seem like a good way to store bitcoin: "I'll just hash some text I have access to and use it as wallet. I'll be able to access it everywhere and if it's like a passage from my favorite book I(ll have a complex password and I won't even have to memorize it"
**But it isn't.**
Long story short, it's very very hackable. Check out this video [ 
The presenter goes into more detail. And for a Christmas present use those tools above and check the sha256 hash for " how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood".
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:54:59
The hash of "This message contains 0.001 Bitcoin for anyone clever enough to claim it. Merry Christmas!" when run through sha256 gives you the private key to the address shown above. Then you would just have to import/sweep that private key into your wallet get the funds for your self.
You can check it for yourself with these tools:

Hey, if I'm not wrong you should have 2 of the 3 private keys right? So you should be able to override their decision.

You'd need a financial institution as a middleman for it to work. BitPay does it if I'm not wrong.
But theoretically it can also work in a more decentralized/distributed way. You'd have Alice trying to spend/trade her bitcoin for goods/services or dollars, Bob who wants to trade goods/services for fiat and Charlie who wants to trade his dollars for bitcoin. So the three would create a 2-out-of-3 multisig.
1. Alice deposits bitcoins on the multisig address to buy an online course from Bob
2. Bob sends the course to Alice and shares the proof with Alice and Charlie
3. Charlie pays Bob for the bitcoins, shares proof of the payment with Alice and Bob and signs a transaction sending the bitcoins in the multisig for him
4. Alice or Bob can then provide the second signature needed to forward the bitcoins to Charlie
In this scenario Bob never touches bitcoin but still participates in the network. In one way it would add more liquidity to the Bitcoin ecosystem because loads of people would join in without having to touch bitcoin. But on the other side it may prove difficult to create a market with live book orders to match people's requests both in terms of value and time-frames for delivery of services/goods.

The idea is that you pick any text you want and use it's sha256 hash as a private key.
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:31:15
Oh. Bitaddress allows you to put the hash as the private key and make sure it corresponds to the address given by the OP. And [blockchain.com]( allows you to check the address' balance. So only the first link gives you the hash. But I thought the other two links may prove useful to whoever wanted to check.

The same way it works now and the miners will only get the transaction fees.

You have good critiques about how [btc.com]( should let the user know why they aren't able to make transactions. And I'm sure they'll look to improve it.
Onto where I think you're wrong: one as to why one would keep secret how they diagnose "odd behavior" is so that bad actors don't have info to exploit. And the 2-out-of-3 multisig wallet is a good semi custodial option for beginners like you who can't secure safely their private keys. A great deal amount of bitcoins were lost not because they were stolen but because people forgot their passwords/passphrases or were ignorant of basic redundancy practices.
You wouldn't have had to even blink had you correctly stored your second private key that would allow you to sign your transactions.

Theoretically in a setting where bitcoin has achieved ubiquitous unit of account it can work offline using wallets like those provided by opendime and tangem.
