They are papers about real world trials on real communities all over the world.
The only major difference that they don't/can't account for is that UBI is supposed to be forever, and not for a set period of time.

Where do you personally draw the line in terms of taxes funding society/infrastructure? 
Do you think personally funded roads are a better idea than government funded roads? What about water and electricity? Do you agree with welfare? 
Asking in good faith, I'm not trying to bate you into an argument or try to change your opinions. I'm just curious where you would draw the line. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:05:23
That's the whole reason for scientific papers though. People tend to view their own situation, opinions and experiences as a microcosm of the whole, when that's not always the case.

It seems like what you're doing is oversimplifying, not going deeper.

I don't believe it's voluntary, because if I choose not to have a job I will become homeless and then starve to death. It's technically a choice, but not really.

Seriously though, your boss makes money from your labour.
How is that different? Why do you think they're entitled to your labour? 
Your landlord paid 10% of the value of your house and you're paying the rest off for them. Your labour is paying for their house without then having to do anything for it.
The shareholders of your workplace earn money from the labour of those that work there. They didn't work for it. That's the product of your labour going into their pockets. 
The banks use the money that you have stored in their accounts to invest and earn a profit from. They don't give you any if that profit. That's literally taking the product of your labour and directly earning money from it. 
The list of professions who get their money from other peoples work goes on and on. To give the argument that social services (or ubi, or anything paid for through taxes) is evil because it's stealing from you is totally hypocritical, because this is a central aspect of capitalism.

I'm actually totally in favour of scrapping the current economic system in its entirety. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:40:03
Ancaps aren't part of a Leftist ideology in any way. They call themselves anarcho capitalists because they want to portray their views in was certain way.
Compete deregulation of industry and lack of economic safeguards is just right libertarianism at its most ridiculous and watered down. 
They're just advocating for fascism with corporations instead of a governing body.
There is NOTHING about anarcho capitalism that is left wing.

Unfortunately the studies I read about were all done on humans, who didn't act like feral animals.

What if, instead of learning about the basic fundamentals of economics, I just tell people that everything would be better if the government stopped regulating businesses and let them do whatever they wanted. I don't have to provide any sources, general statements that back it up or even anecdotes.
Not a millionaire buddy? That's the governments fault, somehow.
Don't like stuff? That's the government doing that, probably.

Where have you seen this?
I've read every report on every UBI trial that I've come across, and they've all been uniformly positive.

Yes.

I don't think the onus is on me to explain your post for you.
You're saying "Less government = better pay", and frankly I don't know how to argue that because I have no idea what angle you're coming from there. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:13:40
That's totally true about biased information potentially pushing agendas, and I'd never expect anyone to just take something as fact without looking into it first. There does come a point where your own bias, based on your experiences, can lead you to dismiss real information just because it doesn't line up with what you expect.

Stickem in your bank account and buy bitcoin with them.

I love that you felt the need to explain the back story even though the op of this thread is quite obviously referencing it.

Plus anyone who has that kind of cash lying around doesn't need a nest egg.

A million bitcoin right now would cost about 3.8 billion dollars.

I'm being hyperbolic. A smartphone isn't a luxury in this day and age, it's a necessity, especially if they're ever going to get themselves out of that situation. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:56:01
That's a pretty specific assumption to make based on just the fact that I have access to Internet in my workplace.
You're way off the mark. I work in fraud investigation for Apple. We're largely self managed due to the nature of the work. There is nothing bro-ish, normal or chill about it.

That's a contradiction in terms. There's certainly discussion to be had on how socialism can and has descended into dictatorships in the past, but they can't be both at the same time.

Can someone explain to an ignorant user what the benefits are for a hardware wallet over a desktop one?
Is it simply due to the fact that someone could gain access to my computer?

Man there are companies that pay roughly £100 for accounts with 40k karma just to subtely shill their products and sway opinions.
There are public markets selling accounts by the hundreds. 
How much of reddit do you think is actually real? I'd hate to see the percentage of actual users, the percentage of guerilla marketers and the percentage of people karma farming to sell their accounts to marketers.

You can also sell them to gift card sites and redeem them on amazon/eBay.

My work colleague has been talking about buying in since he first asked me about the graphs I'm always looking at. That was around $3k.
He's still dragging his feet on it, despite seeing me make actual returns on investments every week.

Should they not be allowed the necessities that you take for granted?
Oddly enough, I see a lot of them wearing coats and shoes as well.

That's why we have a different name for them, to differentiate between what a wolf and a dog is. 
In your analogy, we should be calling dogs wolves.

I beg to differ. Bitcoin is bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is not bitcoin.

Needs must, the rent is due and I have zero money.
I made a hell of a lot of profit, so I'm not too bummed out. I'll be buying back in as soon as I get my finances sorted.

I usually just say "30% on top of what I've put in".

That kind of information is staggeringly easy to get hold of. As part of my job working for a fruit based electronics company I doxx people on a daily basis, and I've access to more personal data than most people would want to believe.

If you have Lambo money you're probably past caring.

If that were actually the case then no rational government would allow it. It's demonstrably not the case though.

Banks don't get shut down.
HSBC were deliberately and willingly laundering money for the Mexican cartel and got a slap on the wrist.
