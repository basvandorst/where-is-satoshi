"I want people to eat healthy so we need the government to ban fast food. I want them to stop smoking, better ban cigarettes! I also don't like big cars/expensive jewellery/yachts/reality tv/hip hop, they should be banned."

Movies are only numbers on your hard drive, and yet it's illegal to share them online.
What's stopping them from declaring bitcoin illegal (and litecoins etc.)? If they stop business from accepting them, the would be no more bitcoin exchanges and no more bitcoins trades.

namefetish never said Ghana doesn't have cities, cars or stores. Who are you replying to and why are you getting upvoted?
He asked if Ghana has a free market. Apparently its economy isn't really free, but it's not too bad 
The question is: why is it impossible to use Paypal in Ghana? Is it because of government intervention or because Paypal doesn't want to do business with people from Ghana?

Lmao. DDOSing a subreddit?
It's just that Bitcoins make a lot of buzz in the media. I heard that it reached $200 yesterday and talked about it to my friends, 2 of them have browsed this subreddit (even though they never visited Reddit). 
5000 people is nothing.

It takes 30 seconds to say "Hey you know you can buy 0.1 bitcoins for $80? Or 0.01 bitcoins for $8... You don't have to exchange a whole bitcoin."
If someone doesn't understand that then maybe he shouldn't use bitcoin.

The French taxation system is really complicated and I sucked at my tax law classes, but I'm pretty sure you have to declare your income converted to Euros, using the rate of the day you received the money.
Yep, after a 30 seconds Google search:

[He's the CEO of an investment company]( of course he's not going to say to his clients to invest in bitcoins instead of gold.

If someone bought every bitcoin, what would he do with it?
Spend it. If he spend it, he has to give it to someone else.

I'm not for Bitcoin athene, im a forex invester, i'll tell you what i believe. It's a bunch of jews sniffing cocane to make you buy more software, fuck your software and to fuck people over. honestly who would pay 1k for nothing, it is nothing think about it. its a investment scam that the small mind would not put in perspective, its like me making a code saying its worth something, geting big corps to support it by accepting it when its VIRTUALLY NOTHING and the weak minded fall for it. thumbs up so athene can see please. ﻿
