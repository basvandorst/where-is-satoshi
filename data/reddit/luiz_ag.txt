I just did it, that's exactly how dogecoin raised some awareness some time ago,

Look how people are interested. Calling it "bits" and adopting this bigger values makes it more interesting.
I just set my account and will start giving some tips, this is so simple and yet so powerful.

**Oh an orange letter, I love orange letters!**
Well, I forgot this thread completely and it looks like I have been *downvoted* to inferno.
No problems, people like to defend their points (I do) and sometimes are passionate about it. I will answer you and I'd love to hear a good point from your side.
I remember (and it can be read right above this post) I said one thing about gold: 


I do love gold! But we are comparing Bitcoins to gold. You compared **bitcoin tokens** with gold, if you had your money stored at Mt. Gox, sorry, but it was just something similar to Bitcoins, but it was not Bitcoins.
I like you way of thinking, but this flaw is not about Bitcoin, it was about Bitcoin tokens that unfortunately lots of people trusted. 
Tell me, is it a good thing to have your money stored in something heavy?  If it is just a bit, that's okay, but...
I said I love gold and I love it being heavy, but think about that 22,974 lbs of gold. Really, think about it. Think you are a rich man, a billionaire, maybe you are, think about large scale. You said *"That takes some work to steal and the neighbors might notice."*. 
That is, maybe, one of the reasons we are using less gold and using more paper nowadays. Gold is really, really heavy and that's not always a good thing (maybe not just in the case of the theft).
And that is so inconvenient... Being heavy is not good if you think big. We may love heavy bracelets, I'd love a heavy watch, but I prefer my reserve of value light! So light and easy to carry that it could travel the world faster than me, as fast as data travels the cables that make the internet. That's one of the things that make virtual currency incredible!
If you are as careful with your Bitcoins as you said you would be with your gold, then I assure you that it will not *"disappear due to some keystrokes"*.
But that was a nice point, you can have that.

Look, I love gold: it's shiny, yellow, heavy and can be used for many useful things.
But at worst, if it is in your bank, you will only have some beautiful papers, no pretty bracelets for you.
Considering that you have it stored somewhere in your house and not in your bank... that is not exactly secure.
