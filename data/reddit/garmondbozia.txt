wow, we forget that bitcoin is still hovering around 600 usd which is almost three times last Aprils spike and only half of the 1200  December peak.  The coin is still sitting pretty if you ask me. The price now has to climb through real economic growth now in my opinion which will take time as it is still very inaccessible to the average user. Why would  anybody who is not idealogically based supporter or early adopter use the coin? The transaction cost of acquiring the coin is still too high and the risks are absurdly high and the average person does not understand it.

That reminds me of every old geezer that simply has no clue. These oldy mcoldersons have not taken the time to actually understand what bitcoin is and dismiss it out of hand. Smart people are sometimes more ignorant than us mere mortals.

2.75 bitcoins not much but lots for to me. To me it seems like maybe they are having some serious technical difficulties but who knows. My point in sending  this is to reassure some that they may still get their BTC and to be fair to MTgox as I was going to rip in to them but they are likely needing  some help on their end and maybe if people calm down a bit, they can get   this disaster under control. .

People hate Bitcoin because it threatens the status quo, whether it is  financial intsitutions, or a new cultural phenom. Think of it as you kids and that damn rock, or Rap, or insert music of the day here.  Think of it as your best friend becoming best friends with someone you introduced him/her to.... Think of it as the established aristocracy hating the nouveau  riche, or the rookie bball player replacing or taking the starting spot of a senior guard. The analogies go on. The fact is, people feel threatened financially and culturally.

so, in terms of using the command line, how would I go about doing this? I am familiar with the command line, but rarely use it so I am unsure of how I would go about accessing my wallet or a wallet using the command line. could you elaborate on this aspect please?  
@_date: 2014-05-06 19:14:47
Although this is good for visibility, until merchants hold on to and transact in Bitcoins with suppliers etc, the value of Bitcoin will remain flat, and bitcoin simply remains a payment platform similar to what paypal does and not a currency. I am not sure what or how this company is dealing with their bitcoin payments, but I am assuming they are cashing out the instant they receive  through coin base or some other entity. 
How can we get companies holding on to the currency and getting them to pay vendors, suppliers and employees in bitcoins?

how do I send a tip to this where is the public key sorry, I am literally blind so I miss lots of info. thanks

Hi thanks, I am going to go through your email in a little bit more detail tomorrow as I am getting swamped but just wanted to say thanks as I can  already tell there is  tonnes of useful info in it.  One point . I will be in touch tomorrow   once I go through the email a little bit more. 
thanks

I would like to comment on  this aspect of the  discussion:
In terms of using a text based tool, that sounds pretty awesome compared to having to try to always figure out how a GUI integrates with a screen reader. However, like most Blind people I am sure, we are generally ignorant to these options as we have not been exposed to this option. Before I went blind, my tech interest was not   really an interest and so when I I first started using a computer as a blind person, I was given a a screen reader to learn like most blind people Iam sure. These options simply are not the convention when it comes to adaptive tools
@_date: 2014-01-05 09:04:09
yes I am interested in being part of the testing/beta group. I think I PM'ed  you with my personal email but not  sure. let  me know how I can proceed. I  will also check out the githublink you posted. 
thanks  
@_date: 2014-01-05 09:57:18
I am not sure if this is what you are asking about but I use a key board for input and audio for output. For  me to use this on my own, my screen reader has to be able to access and read all the widgets in a logical and coherent manner as well as any supporting information, instructions, text, ect and any menues, links  edit boxes, sidebarssidemenues, ....

I read the preliminary draft of that paper, and it is not an IMF sanctioned document, it was done by some academic financial lawyer...
@_date: 2014-01-05 07:47:49
Are you talking to me? 
If so, I have some  notions of how the Bitcoin QT may be coded, but really....no I do not.
And no, I am unsure  of what exactly Bitcoin QT is because I have not actually not been able to use it. Kind of helps to be able to use it to know it. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 03:42:17
Heck yeah it is a lot of work, try scanning through a webpage by  listening to the content...try writing an essay in a word document without seeing it,  try learning to code by  listening to the syntax and  structure of the argument. That being said,  being blind is also not all that bad in that my life is pretty damn good in a lot of ways...just look at the support I got in this readit!
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:34:59
Hi, yeah I have   heard of the commandline and have attempted to  learn some, it takes some getting used to though.  
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:15:39
I like that argument and it reminds me of  Marshall Maclhuan and Robert Guttman ....when the technology changes so does the money form, not just from centralized cash sources to centralized  digital monetary systems, but from centralized to decentralized systems,  this is the way it is all going...everything. Is it good, who the ehll knows.
@_date: 2014-05-29 21:13:51
Nice work, this is the best way.... all the third party BS actually  hurts the full verticle economic integration of bitcoin.  BTW verticle integration is a great way to describe what needs to be done to see real success for Bitcoin. Nice work !!

@_date: 2014-01-06 04:02:30
okay, I would love to help ....but I am getting a little bit freaked out here (in a good but scarey way) as I have to start prioritizing what is what or I will not be able to get anything done. 
I am already starting to lose track of what is what and who is what and what is who and ....you get my point. I am also starting back on my masters this week and that will suck my life dry for the next three months so I have to figure out how many irons I have in the fire and which ones are goihng to burn me. that being said, PM me (if you have not already) and we can  exchange email and some contact details and we can go from there. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:00:23
no I have not tried the on line wallets that I am aware of. I know I store some of my bitcoins on the exchanges for now, but I will look in to it. Thanks

I think perhaps the trade deficit might be alleviated by competing cryptocurrencies, I do not think we are going to have a highlander situation as in there can be more than one.

I use Jaws 13.0 for a screen reader. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 04:26:18
that means I am in the top 3% as well. hooray.. I am one of the elites for once. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:51:19
what most economists forget to factor in is the fact that there are about 200 other currencies fighting for market share, this will help to keep Bitcoin from getting hoarded. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 14:02:53
yeah no kidding...Github needs to get on that it would be an amazing accelerator for BTC
@_date: 2014-06-01 08:03:05
try to vertically integrate bitcoin's   in to your  companies business model as much as possible....that is, pay any employees that want some or all of their wages in the form of Bitcoins. Try to  pay vendors and vendors with bitcoins, and accept bitcoins. If you jus t just go through coinbase or whatever, it is not really accepting bitcoin in my opinion.  You are  just making things more complex for no real benefit. Unless  you increase your  revenue from the extra sales of your products  that result from accepting Bitcoin's, so that the marginal benefits are greater than your marginal costs. That includes the things that you cannot quantify very well, such as an extra thrity mouse clicks  every oour for the extra administration that might result from.

Hi, can you define what "bindings" are and how they work and I could    probably provide an anser. That being said, I want to access my bitcoin wallet,  whichever one is accessible by using Jaws (screenreader) . When I tried to download BitcoinQT, or whatever it is called, I could get to the menues and slect some of the options, however, in terms of knowing what the  options actually do was a mystery as they were not labled or they did not seem to really do anything. Furthermore, I had no sense of the scope of the interface as the address bar could not be read nor anything else on the GUI. 
It was really very abstract in terms of what it is. I mean, I had no sense of what it actually does/did.

I will definitely look in to this and contact you if I need help...which is likely. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:31:37
I just have to say, when I posted about not being able to access bitcoin walletsas a blind person, I got an overwhelming response that was 99% positive and so, for those who claim that r/bitcoin is a  bunch  of a/holes  is just simply wrong.

hello, I am unfamiliar with electrum but I know that with platforms that are based on Java, there are accessibility API`s that  allow a screen reader to access the underlying  code in a program or interface/GUI.  It involves a little extra prep when a project is first developed in that design considerations with regards to logical flow of how an interface would be used by a blind person, labeling or tagging the widgets, and of course testing the software with someone who uses a screenreaer to actually see if it is  usable. the Java accessibility  JDK/API also supports other accessible technologies, although I am not sure which exact ones but things like voice command and braille terminals, font   contrasting and magnification as well as I think for technologies that support other forms of disability.
. 
For other platforms, I am not sure how accessibility is included.  I am only familiar with Java when it comes to this.

I cannot believe there is hardly any upvotes or comments on this one...this is a big deal 
@_date: 2014-05-30 14:30:54
you just inspired me to do the same. I offered the first four people who download the multibit wallet and post their public key, $5CAD worth of Bitcoin. Brilliant...!!

It is always super cheesy when you watch an older movie or read a book that is using “cutting edge technology" as a prop or gimmick to make it seem cool. I always think back to lethal weapon 4, for all of you that are over 34 years old, and the scene when Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are on the walkway over the freeway using a huge ass cell phone. The cell comes in this huge suit case and at the time, I am sure, people were floored by the amazing cell phone/suitcase technology, not to mention Mel Gibson's huge ass mullet...
So for the Rise and Rise of Bitcoin, this problem is potentially exponentially going to be bad as the pace of technology change is even more an issue to contend with, so if it is out in like two years after its initial release date, then they are screwed. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:54:17
yep, that is what will drive bitcoins success and stability, it will be good to have more people thinking along these lines

my appologies to the bitcoin developers and to you, as my intent was not to be hostile  or to discount anybodies efforts, but rather show my frustrations and to get this issue sorted out . First of all, I am really not sure  where to find the "developers" as it is not really obvious where an authoritative body of developers exist  and who exactly does a person know to turn to and trust especially when the community is a decentralized semi autonomous and anonomous group?,  So, actually I do feel this was an appropriate forum to ask for help and get some attention to this issue. One thing that I have learned as a blind person when it comes  to accessibility, if you do not make some noise, your problems tend to get put on the back burner. In this case, that would not  be appropriate as incorporating accessibility  is easier done from the start rather than as an after thought when it comes to software development. 
Also, if others did not feel that this was an important issue, it would have gotten voted down rather than up so perhaps there is merit to my claims and actions.
