Will that force them to implement segwit to save on power consumption 
@_date: 2018-09-14 22:41:24
Of course it will, if it can be controlled they can make money from it!
@_date: 2018-09-08 15:09:29
The internet is the best source of information I've found
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:55:18
I think probably because it's only a temporary suspension till September 20th. Reading between the lines hints that the U.S. could launch its own ETF on said date. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 15:10:53
Noticed a few mainstream media news reporting old FUD news and arguments too. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 22:16:13
As far as I know it hasn’t been, but it will be since another crypto claims it has
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:12:20
I suppose because they have better insight as to which way the price is going, that and they initiate it so traders lose money. It's essentially insider trading isn't it?
@_date: 2018-09-14 21:57:31
Well yeah, but bitcoin and most other crypto when using almost any exchange isn’t what it claimed to be. Which was without oversight 
@_date: 2018-09-14 22:56:58
So unless the world suddenly decides to switch to crypto in one fowl sweep, there isn’t a chance in hell that crypto will be the people’s saviour from governmental and banking control. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 21:38:05
Just that they’ve been in the business of coming up and out with new business models for decades, so why not come out with another that after the recent economic crisis states it’s something that the banks can’t control 
@_date: 2018-09-14 22:34:27
But you have to use them these days, along with all the regulations that goes with them
@_date: 2018-09-14 21:39:26
Which to make it mainstream most people will do
@_date: 2018-09-14 22:00:30
You have anyway if you did the AML/KYC
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:08:28
But fiat and hope it doesn't blow away in the wind
@_date: 2018-09-14 22:52:05
Ok, my real gripe is with the KYC/AML, that freely giving over your credentials for convenience to withdraw your money into fiat is a really bad thing that, in the long run, only serves the government and banks. I guess I’m suggesting is the only possible method of exchange without oversight is via p2p. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 20:54:45
If you are older an wiser you should know by now that democracy is a joke, a lie to make the general public believe that they have the power to make decisions about what government do. There is no such thing as accountability in government or banking or big business, just fines. Said fines that are inevitably paid back with by the people that support said governments and banks. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:18:56
You do realise that sinbad had a gang of 40 thieves 
@_date: 2018-09-14 21:40:30
This is just a what if question  because everything is on a public ledger and once you commit to KYC and AML, the only thing they need is your current location. 
Edit: they don’t even need that in the same country 
@_date: 2018-09-14 22:31:34
I’d love to know they KYC/AML wallet that lets you keep your private key 
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:32:11
So not much different than crypto then
@_date: 2018-09-14 21:52:05
It’s the December/January pump and dump that got me thinking about this stuff. It’s like a what if we get people hooked on crypto, it’s the same brain chemicals released that’s found in drug addicts. They’ll want more and agree to anything!

If you need it, sell it. If you don’t, you might as well leave it because it will bounce back at some point. I can’t see it actually hitting 1k but it doesn’t mean it won’t.

@_date: 2018-11-20 16:55:09
Nearly everyone you ask in the crypto community is going to say buy but nobody really knows. However, it will bounce back after the recent big drop, if it isn’t already in the process.
