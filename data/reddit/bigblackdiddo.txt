Dude, you've been completely brainwashed by anti-fiat propaganda. Fiat does not depreciate on such small timescales.

More like "hodl not because I care about your wealth, but because if everyone sells, my own investment will lose value".

The Venezuelan gov must've read the same "basic econ" books this thread's OP read.

Damn, we better get those conniving poor and middle class to cough up their money then! The rich are struggling enough as it is after all, how will they afford that second Maserati?

Asking a poor person to give the same percentage of their salary as the rich is a complete recipe for disaster. Income brackets exist for a reason because every extra dollar is less essential for living and can be taxed higher with little to no impact on quality of life.

Your incredibly conceited attitude towards spending even a small portion of your money to increase the standard of living for your community and neighbours is also why the US is the only first-world country where citizens die or go homeless just to pay for basic healthcare. Smh

No, we all understand what you mean, I don't think *you* understand how asinine a flat-tax rate is. Let's assume for simplicity the tax rate is 50%. A guy that can afford 2 eggs to barely feed his family can now only afford 1. His family starves. Meanwhile, a guy who can afford 50 eggs to feed his family, still has 25 eggs left and is easily getting by.
If your line of thinking is "The poor guy should just work harder!" instead of asking the rich man to share more of his plentiful eggs, then you are beyond saving.
Edit: holy shit you actually think corporations will be more generous if they are taxed less. I'm dying. How do you even breathe in that bubble of delusion you've made for yourself?
