You apparently did not even read my post or understand the point of it.

It's my understanding you can use 12 or 24, I'll clarify in the post but the point is to see if just 12 is enough.

It cannot. I needed *some* number to use as a guessing rate and went with that. Like I said, the real life rate would probably be much slower than this, but I didn't see any other better option. I literally pulled the number out of thin air.

True, I just assumed words could be re-used for the sake of simplicity

I'm not sure I follow. Obviously what I described is an over-simplification, and we don't have enough info to accurately make calculations.  That's why I didn't even bother with any numbers besides the orders of magnitude.
I don't understand much about the entropy process, or how the words are derived, or how the words turn into the seed, and the seed into the private key, etc. Correct me if I'm wrong, but none of that matters because the truth of the matter is if you have the words, you can get the key. 
Yes I know the hashing estimate is way off, but I knew that at the very least, the real-world guess rate would be much much slower than what I used. So this is a worst-case scenario. And the point of the post is not to calculate some accurate number (though I do believe my general equation is correct), just to show that it's secure enough.

Good to know. Adding a custom word would theoretically expand the dictionary to the entire english language, essentially making the seed many many multitudes stronger.

I updated the equation at the end to be more general. With our current time of 1 million years for 1626 words, we'd do:
10^6 years / 2^x = 1 year
so X = ~20 years

He's a kook but he's gotta be doing something right

Doesn't matter as far as I can tell, the 12 words are all that matters. If you can brute force the words you're all set, of course assuming they didn't implement any passphrase as a salt.  I'd be interested to hear how the entropy affects the number of combinations of words in the seed. But my guess is that if you wanted to brute force it all, you'd have to guess every combo anyway.

Yes I believe the whole point is that you'll get a unique key if even one character is off. This would be called a collision. That's not to say it would be absolutely impossible though, if there are flaws in the algorithm for example.

That's assuming the hashrate of the mining pool is equal to the guessing rate of keys, which is not a great comparison but it's something. In reality it would take much longer I believe.
