If I pay a merchant over a direct lightning channel and receive goods/services, then obviously a payment has occurred. The merchant isn't providing those goods/services to me for nothing. The fact that it wasn't immediately settled on the blockchain shouldn't change that. Money is being transmitted here.
Now examine an alternative scenario where the payment is routed over multiple lightning channel hops. What is happening with each individual hop is technically identical to the first scenario, where the money was sent over just one hop.  If the money was transmitted in the first scenario, then logically it must also be transmitted with each hop in the second scenario.

Better analogy: when money needs to be transferred from an account at bank A to an account at bank B,  but they can't do the transfer directly (because neither bank has a [correspondent account]( with the other), then they'll need to find some other (bigger) bank G where they both have a correspondent account to mediate the transfer.
By transacting over two channels to mediate a transfer, Lightning gateways are acting exactly like that bank G. I don't know whether that's a money transmitter.

When software systems communicate, ideally the messages have the "idempotency" property. This means that the same identical message can be sent more than once, and it won't have any additional effect. The receiver only handles the message the first time, and ignores any subsequent copies. One simple way to achieve this is giving each message a unique ID, and letting the receiver store a list of IDs of handled messages.
Idempotency is desirable because sometimes you can't be sure whether the message was received, and you have to sent it again to make sure. (e.g. network dropped out right after sending and you didn't receive the received confirmation.) You don't want the resent message to have a double effect in that case.
Many software systems lack this property because of design flaws or because of idempotency bugs. Like maybe the systems that banks offer to businesses to automate payment processing. Kraken may not be able to tell the difference between the bank sending the same identical payment information twice, or the bank sending two very similar messages about different payments. So they will probably flag it for manual checking, which will take longer.
This is just speculation on my part.

When you buy from a broker at some quoted price "without fees", then the fee is already included in the price. There will be a different price for buying and selling, partly because the broker needs to make a profit.

When people say somthing like this, it is usually because they have heard about the concept of "legal tender" but slightly misunderstood it. Legal tender just means that if there is a conflict about some debt, then the creditor must accept euros from the debtor. He can't refuse those even if there was an agreement to pay the debt with gold for example.
When purchasing something in a store, there is never any debt, so the store is free to only accept gold.
So it's not "payments" in general where euros must be accepted. Only payments to meet financial obligations.

Well, that's not entirely true. If you needed the security against double spending provided by 1 minute of hashing, then right now you can't have that.

The main problem is that  the difficulty for finding a single share on P2Pool is the bitcoin difficulty divided by 60, which is very large. Other pools have a difficulty that is more than 100x lower.
Also, the shares are tracked in a "sharechain" which advances 60 times faster than bitcoin blocks, so there are a lot more orphans, i.e. shares that are not accepted and thus wasted work.
That parameter "60" has an opposite effect on both issues. Fixing the first problem by lowering the difficulty makes the second problem worse, and vice versa.

The market cap of companies in the payment business can be related to their profit, and profit to transaction fees. But I don't think that this works for bitcoin market cap, so the numbers just aren't comparable.
Instead, these are the numbers that you need to guess to properly estimate bitcoin value:
- F = value flux, how much value (e.g. in dollars) will be transacted via bitcoins per day?
- D = how many days will the circulating bitcoins sit still between transactions on average?
- B = how many bitcoins will be in circulation?
The value of a bitcoin can then be calculated as (F*D)/B. 
You can still do wishful thinking when picking these values of course, but at least you can provide a rationale for them.

I suspect they are counting the total amount of bitcoins including change, instead of estimating the part that was transacted. So the number is inflated by orders of magnitude.

Your example involves wallets which reuse addresses, which make it particularly easy to see someones balance and payment history. But unfortunately this is also a problem for better wallets that don't reuse (e.g. BIP32). 
Suppose you have to make a 1.23 mBTC payment. It is unlikely that you have an unspent output which exactly matches this amount, so the transaction will involve one or more inputs and two outputs: one for the payment, and one for change. With some simple heuristics it is simple to guess which output is which.
Now this can be used to track your spends going forward,  *but also backwards* to find your previous spends! 
And because with each transaction in such a chain the change gets smaller, eventually it will get used in a payment
 with more than one input from your wallet. This causes all your addresses to be tied together. 
Currently the only practical way to prevent this is via third party services or by partitioning your bitcoins into completely separate  unlinkable wallets

These tricks generate passphrases that look like they have high entropy, but really have low entropy. It doesn't matter that it *looks* complex/random if the attacker can come up with the same scheme that was used to generate it. Deciding whether to SHA-256 hash your password by coinflip: 1 extra bit of entropy. Reversing two parts of the hash or not: another 1 bit. Choosing the number of hashing rounds: another few bits. 
Yes, you can argue that the security of the scheme comes from its selection from an infinite number of possible schemes. But unfortunately you'll be much more likely to pick a memorable scheme, so the amount of entropy added by that selection will be lower than you might expect. An attacker will try to build a model of how people come up with such schemes and will try the more likely options first. You'll never be able to quantify objectively exactly how secure your passphrase is. 
I believe it is better to use a passphrase generation method that allows you to calculate exactly how much entropy is in the result, e.g. [diceware]( so that you don't have to worry about how smart your attacker is. Generate a passphrase with 128 bits of entropy via coin flips or dice rolls (that's 10 words in diceware)  and be done with it.

Exahashes, sure. But the exponential growth in hash rate is about to slow dramatically as miners have almost caught up with the latest semiconductor manufacturing process ([22nm]( 
After that any improvements will be limited by Moore's law, meaning that you'll have to wait a year or two for each next generation of more efficient miners. Any growth of the hash rate in the meanwhile would have to come from "more miners" instead of "better miners". And since bitcoins are minted at an approximately fixed rate regardless of hashing, the bitcoin network can only support so many miners at a given price.

The way I understood the paper is that the attack analyzes how transactions are relayed, and then uses that information to group certain transactions as coming from the same node. So if you would spend two completely unrelated transaction outputs in two different transactions, then the attacker could still figure out that they came from the same wallet.
That's not the kind of attack zerocash is designed to defend against. Zerocash is about breaking the links between transactions which are currently linked via their outputs/inputs in bitcoin.

The era of CPU mining ended when serious GPU mining started in the summer of 2010. The hashrate has grown about a factor 100 million since then. So a sudden return to CPU-only would mean the next block would take about a 10 minutes * 100 million = 1900 years to find.

GHash now has the power to orphan any block that contains anything that they don't like (or that a government with the power to coerce GHash doesn't like). They can do things like choosing the minimum transaction for all transactions and blacklisting addresses.
By orphaning blocks, they will make the work that went into the block useless, thereby effectively increasing the GHash share of the total hashing power. So they even have a direct incentive to use this power.

The supply follows a fixed curve, independent of the amount of mining. Therefore, "the enormous amount of wealth being put in ASICs and mining operations" as you put it will have no influence on supply.
Without an influence on supply, there is no "dragging down" influence on the price. If anything, the high hashrate should inspire confidence in bitcoin because it makes it more difficult for a single malicious entity to gain control over it.

Kind of, but not really. The explanation in classical physics is that light, being an electromagnetic wave, will cause charged particles to jiggle. Sort of like a wave causing stuff on the water surface to bob up and down. Now when charged particles are jiggled like that, they will emit more electromagnetic waves of their own.
So the original light doesn't get entirely absorbed; it just loses some energy which gets reemitted as more light. Then all these light waves superimpose, and if you do the math the combined light wave turns out to be "slower".
The explanation in quantum mechanics is even more mind bending. The spaces between the particles of the substance act like slits much like in the double slit experiment. So you have each photon taking *every possible path* through the substance *at the same time*. And this photon will *interfere with itself* as a wave. And like in the classical physics explanation, the recombined result turns out to be a slower wave.

This post is implying that it is impossible to pay of all debt when money is created by lending it at interest. I also used to believe this, but (in principle) debt can be payed off even when there is more debt than money in circulation. This can be shown with a simple thought experiment.
Imagine Alice borrows $100 from Bob (with or without interest), and then we disrupt the system by destroying almost all money. We are left with only $1 in circulation.
Alice can never repay the debt right? No, she actually might be able to repay. For example:
* Alice provides goods or services and earns the one dollar
* She uses the dollar to pay off some debt to Bob.
* Bob uses the dollar to acquire goods and services.
* Eventually the dollar ends up back at Alice as in the first step, and the cycle repeats.
This works even when there is interest due on the borrowed money. The higher the velocity of money, the higher the interest and total debt that can be tolerated.
Now, it's true that this may not always work. The debt may grow faster than the money circulates, and then there will be trouble. But it is not as simple as implied by the OP.

Those are safe from brute force attacks, under the condition that they were randomly generated with a good source of entropy. Do NOT create your own by picking words from the bip39 wordlist yourself. When you pick a word sequence that you feel is memorable, you are reducing entropy. Attackers will figure out a model for what is "memorable" and will focus their search on that.

It depends on how quickly a ECDSA public key could be cracked.
If it is crackable within seconds, then you can't really do a transaction because conflicting transactions to steal the funds would appear as soon as the original transaction reveals the public key. Those transactions would then race the original (and each other) for inclusion in the next block.
If it is crackable in days, then there's still a problem because at the end of 2018 when the fees went crazy, it wasn't unusual for a low-fee transaction to wait that long in the mempool before finally getting into a block.
If the expected time to crack the ECDSA public key is orders of magnitude larger than the expected time to get the first confirmation, then yes it would be true.

Binance trading fees are 0.1%. If you pay the taker fee on coinbase pro (which is avoidable but otherwise you'll have to wait for someone to accept your bid, and the market might move the other way while you wait) then that's another 0.3% fee.
So that's 0.3% potential profit remaining, or $3 dollar for every $1000 you cycle through coinbase deposit/coinbase buy/btc transfer/binance sell/binance withdraw. Factor in transfer/deposit/withdrawal fees and you'll be left with nothing.

A price of $1 million would mean that miners can afford to spend up to 6.25 million of electricity on each block (assuming the next 6.25 btc/block rate).  At an estimated industrial price of $0.05/kwh, mining would then absorp 750 gigawatts of power. That's roughly 10% of global installed capacity of electricity production.
But of course the electricity price would not stay constant, it would go up a lot and would start to become determined by the bitcoin price. Governments around the world would not like electricity being wasted like that and would take action against bitcoin. [We've already seen it happen on a smaller scale in Plattsburgh.]( Such actions may include banning all bitcoin use altogether, suppressing the price.

Governments don't need to coordinate for this. They will quite naturally take action against something that threatens their economy by gobbling up all the electricity produced within their territory. It's not like the big miners can easily hide their gigawatt installations.
Also, a ban does not have to be 100% effective to suppress the price. Shutting down all exchanges, payment service providers and big miners will be enough to turn it into a fringe phenomenon; then the price will drop.

There is a predetermined amount of bitcoins being mined with each block, and the difficulty is adjusted regularly so that blocks are produced at a fixed rate.
So when miners go offline, this does not reduce the supply of bitcoin. If the "price falls below the price of electricity" as you say, then the difficulty will just go down so that it takes less electricity to mine a block.

Bitcoin power use can be estimated by comparing the hashrate with the power specs of good mining hardware. Or alternatively, by taking the value of mined blocks and assuming that a significant fraction of that is spent on electricity.
This puts the current power use of bitcoin somewhere between 1 and 10 gigawatt. 2 gigawatt would be 0.1% of global electricity use. So yes, we're entering "major factor" territory. If this insane growth continues, bitcoin will start to push up electricity prices.

I probably should have made it more clear that it was a rhetorical question.

Some context: power consumption and production is exactly balanced by using the grid frequency (50 Hz in Europe) as a signal. When there is a slight underproduction, the frequency drops. When this is observed, power production is increased to normalize the frequency.
Therefore, a lower than normal frequency means that electricity producers in some region of the grid don't have enough generation and import capacity to match demand, or that they are choosing to under-supply the grid. Under-supplying could be the rational choice when the price of electricity is set too low to make a profit, or the bills simply aren't paid.

I remember having to paying $10+ and even $20+ fees for bitcoin transactions at some point. When Bitpay receives a payment, they have to do at least one more transaction to do anything with that UTXO. Even if they sweep up UTXOs in one big transaction with many inputs, there is a minimum amount of bytes per UTXO needed, with the associated cost/byte.
How could they *not* charge a UTXO sweep fee in those circumstances? Should they have allowed the small payments to turn into unspendable UTXO dust, [like Coinbase was doing]( Ignoring the potential loss, bloating the UTXO set is definitely not good for bitcoin either. All nodes need to keep this set in memory to be able to efficiently validate transactions.

There is cause for concern. I can think of two simple ways to estimate bitcoin electricity use, and they seem to agree on the order of magnitude:
1. look at the mining reward and assume that competition will drive miners to spend nearly all of it on electricity. Assuming something like 0.05$/kwh for miner electricity cost, I end up with more than 3 gigawatt of power use. This is probably an overestimation.
2. look at the hashrate and assume it is all being produced by the most efficient ASICs that are widely available. Here I end up with something like half a gigawatt. This is probably an underestimation.
So let's guess 1 gigawatt. Compare this to total world power use which averages something like 3000 gigawatt. 
According to the first estimation method, power use is expected to scale with price. If the price goes up N-fold, then so does the power use.
My gut feeling is that this effect puts a ceiling on the bitcoin price. Bitcoin cannot be expected to eat a significant fraction of global electricity consumption; I don't know what exactly but something must break down before that point. Maybe governments will make all bitcoin related activity illegal in an effort to stop electricity prices from rising.

Not if another bear whale decides to sell and eat the whole buy wall. If you are looking to sell a large amount of bitcoins, this is a great opportunity to do so without significant market slippage.
In such an event the trader who put up the buy wall would have no opportunity to cancel it, as a sell order which eats it would execute in one go. So if you put up a buy wall, you better be prepared to actually buy.
@_date: 2017-07-08 23:55:19
Yes, but so far the bitcoin price has been doubling much more often than the reward has been halving. So the number of kwh you can buy with one block reward has grown exponentially. If this trend continues, electricity use will become problematic.

I don't think so. I was regularly using bitcoin for certain payments, and I had to stop because of high transaction fees, extra "UTXO sweep fees" and unpredictable confirmation times. (e.g. I still have a support ticket open with a merchant who's payment flow via bitpay timed out waiting for a confirmation, but then of course the transaction later confirmed anyway and the merchant doesn't understand what happened.)
I imagine there are a lot more users like me who simply gave up on using bitcoin for payments, and this is what has reduced transaction backlog and fees. Those users are not immediately going to come back when the fees lower a bit. I don't want to top up a hot wallet for spending if I'm not even sure if it will be economical to use in couple days.
