I wonder how many people who are into Crypto took Latin as a language in high school / college.

Novo said that under 10k was his buy target. Take that for what it's worth.
@_date: 2019-07-25 03:43:03
Sure, why not?

Down for me as well.

From what I understand China's been heavily intervening in their market - very surprised to see such a dramatic drop.
Any thoughts on the impact for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:03:24
Yes, buying either way.

It is astonishing how hateful people can be towards things they don't understand.

Sorry, this doesn't make sense to me. If the underlying asset is to depreciate significantly due to pull back from the ETF why would GBTC be rising with a premium?
It wouldn't. This is individuals buying Bitcoin in anticipation of an ETF being approved and the subsequent increase in value across the board.

No I don't believe so, all transactions should be included. That's how I've done it.

I get this message: Recalculating Bank Volumes

I can't buy or sell.
Edit: 2:32 ... I'm back up as of right now.

I agree with you but I just took the title from Business Insider's piece.

Adding this quote for context: “My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?” Trump added.

Can't you do a wire transfer to one of the exchanges?
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:12:27
Thanks man! Can't wait for the day that is $25 USD ;)

More fun today! The U.S. Treasury Department has designated China as a currency manipulator amid rising trade tensions with Beijing

Not for their Active Trader interface, its 4x lower than that.

Pretty nice, thanks!

Best hotel I've ever stayed at, hands down. Loved Zurich too.

BAAKT on why they're expanding to include cash settled futures:

So can you convert to DAI, make all your purchases with DAI and then never pay tax?
@_date: 2019-09-12 13:40:55
SoFi has opened up Crypto purchases to some early beta testers. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin available for purchase.
@_date: 2019-09-10 01:37:31
Maybe try a Coinstar ATM if you're in the US. It will be a higher price than exchanges unfortunately.

It is a very nice hotel and absolutely worth the price, fantastic art everywhere in the hotel as well (at least the stuff that was not seized).

Yes it is but not for you (yet). You must download the SPEDN app from Flexa but that requires an invite. If you have the SPEDN app and an invite you can load up your wallet today and pay with Bitcoin, Ethereum and Gemini Dollar.

Most bitcoin debit cards have transaction fees ... there is nothing to currently indicate any transactions fees for the end user here. Plus the merchant has the option to keep the money in crypto and not immediately convert to fiat.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:00:49
Lol at you my friend ... there are progressive companies out there. I believe Overstock has been holding crypto from online purchases for years. Just because most don't doesn't mean some won't. 
The point is most crypto debit cards DO charge a fee as it basically is eating into the % they would get when the person sells their crypto for fiat.
Conversion rate? You can pay in Gemini dollars which is 1 to 1 backed by USD. There is no spread there. Stop spreading uninformed FUD.
