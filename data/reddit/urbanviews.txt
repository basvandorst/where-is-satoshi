I️ took a screen shot so things could be more clear this time. Sorry about last pic guys.
EVERYTHING IS ABOUT TECHNICALS NOW IN LTC, ETH, BTC....  that is why they dipped, people buy sell off these signals
1. Ok so like I️ said last night it wasn’t good when (1st trend broke) 
2. it caught a nice bounce at 2nd trend line, from 12,000 to 12,500 that was good
3. 2nd trend line (NEEDS TO HOLD)

I.T was holding because of the wedge I.T was in, past days, now it’s out, idk or neither does anyone else know where I.T will find support at.
But temporarily this is not a good sign, don’t panic could find support at 13k or 12k
 Buyers won’t be stepping in soon, btc has been falling the trend strong,

These are 1 day candles, this wedge and long term support has held up since the big fall day, today unfortunately I.T broke.
This is a head shoulders pattern looking at the big picture

All coins starting dropping because BTC had a technical failure of its uptrend line and wedge line 
No bad news just chart failure, why it’s important to chart, I.T needs to get back on top of that uptrend line and show strength after I.T does

Correct however I.T was a SMALL head and shoulders also to the right side that I️ did not chart that just gave, I’m thinking I.T will find support soon and I️ will chart I.T again based off the new trend,  I️ don’t hold a position
