Wow you actually managed to ask before I added the link, that was fast :D

Any comprehensive guide on how to set up a node? I managed to get a testnet node running on my laptop pretty quickly, but I wanna be more reckless now. Yes I understand all the risks

"Ether, its main rival"
yeah, sure
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:16:27
Ich glaube du meinst "iirc" oder?
Also "if I recall correctly" bzw. "wenn ich mich recht entsinne/erinnere", anstatt von "imho", was für "in my humble opinion" bzw. "meiner bescheidenen Meinung nach" steht.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:12:43
FYI: It's BitPay
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:06:02
Kann beides der Fall sein, aber "humble" scheint weiter verbreitet zu sein
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:43:14
staking my real money for testing buggy software = reckless, right?
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:31:40
Personally I don't know. But Ethereum is made for a whole different purpose
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:17:39
Funny number coincidence:
According to bitinfocharts.com, the range of 10-100 Bitcoin contains .46% of all addresses and the addresses containing at least 10 with no upper bound make up .53%
You also used "53" and "46"! Coincidence?!?!?!?!? Yes, I even said so in the beginning

we should put this on r/all
more of them updoots please
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:55:00
That is true, but now there is concrete info :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:38:06
Fuck yeah! Are you also from Germany?
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:14:39
Ever heard about a little thing called "there is no crash proof lol"?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:29:10
I would not draw lines to MtGox yet. You don't really have much evidence, especially since there are good reasons why it might take so long.
First of all, every exchange has problems with a huge influx of users. Second, that's a LOT of money. They probably need to run extra checks.
EDIT: Good luck, obviously
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:20:33
I might be confusing things here. Is a "channel" only between two parties? If so then I was thinking about nodes with multiple channels in which case my question is already answered.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:09:04
I sure am enjoying the shit out of it
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:35:51
I love this! I hope OP delivered
edit: :(

So you're saying u/fuckthekids is an alt of yours?

Not familiar with all them annoying laws but they might have been obligated to do that. Can definitely not say for sure though

Am I the only one that feels this post is BS?
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:00:34
I was referring to really large channels. Those would have correspondingly large transactions, right?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:30:51
Right on.

The best thing is the hint at amazons seller fees. Could‘ve just told us

Oh okay, nice! I knew it had to be something simple haha
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:24:42
It's such a nice word :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:11:52
thanks for the flashbacks
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:58:29
You should not have sent them money without being verified. That's communicated clearly on their website. Exchanges are being overrun, so verification will take a REALLY long time if it has to be done manually
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:24:33
This actually somehow sounds like an awesome experience. wtf
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:33:27
Pfft! You think THAT‘S low? I have a 50 sat/byte tx probably never going through. HA!

All we need to wait for now is adoption of LN! I don't know enough about the current situation to make any predictions though :(
For now we just have to sit and wait and use any possibilities we get to make Lightning Transactions whenever wallets are ready :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:11:25
or buy MORE Bitcoin than you spent
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:01:21
I suggest you read up on how SegWit actually works. You said "ONCHAIN fee" which makes me think you actually don't know what SegWit does. There is no such thing as "SegWit fees". They are the same fees but SegWit transactions "segregate" the "witness" data so that more transactions fit into a single block, lowering the fees
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:10:39
I think the first sentence was just meant to say "That's why I use a wallet with customizable fees"
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:28:18
never been more sure
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:05:05
yes! Exactly!
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:41:41
Just sticky it or something

The ping pong of miners jumping back and forth might take a long time to equal out.

To get serious scaling for the long term, we need short term scaling solutions first
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:48:02
Yeah, true.
Didn't think about it too much. Was just happy to see "replay protection"

Goodbye Crypto-nite, redditor for 3 months.
You will be missed. Good luck on your future endeavours under a new name!
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:19:06
yup, but those higher fees will be lower than they would be without segwit and will be lowered more drastically in times of low traffic
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:37:46
any lightning enabled iOS testnet wallets yet?
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:37:32
I think I saw it yesterday somewhere and I really like it :)
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:39:39
Woops, I scrolled through the comments so slowly and switched tabs so often that I literally forgot OP was talking about Trezor
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:25:31
That is a really bold claim that you should provide proof for
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:44:19
You're not just thinking short term, you're thinking REALLY short term!
Think about the long term :)

at least you tried, take my upvote!

coinmarketcap.com right at the top.
OP screenshot is also from there
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:07:39


I'm trying to try but not even that's working
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:35:40


that sounded like u/New_Dawn saw u/castorfromtheva's comment as an argument against Trezor
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:55:00
Wow that's not precise at all haha
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:26:48
51 now, this is insane!
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:32:02
SegWit is just a start. It is by no means meant to "fix" fees.
A nice side effect though is enabling L2 solutions like LN.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:56:06
Not a whole new wallet. 
Just a SegWit address generated with the same private key! :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:29:53
too bad the fork isn't even happening apparently haha
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:34:30


pick one

I PROMISE I will do that if I'm ever there. Unless I forget but then I'd be really sad if I remember it when I'm back on Mars
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:29:45
Well the people designing the Roadster really couldn't have helped producing more 3s
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:58:46
It's SegWit, not sigwit
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:59:04
Just wasted 5 minutes trying to find that website again haha.
Checked it just to be sure and they still accept Bitcoin as payment
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:30:15

The European equivalent is 384.400€ (that dot is a comma because Europe) which is that distance in km :) 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:27:04
Funny enough the whole thing might get Bitcoin a whole lot more exposure
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:39:59
There‘s a merchant in Europe who accepts BTC for cars
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:59:20
Why the fuck didn‘t they make a unicycle pizza cutter?!
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:37:49
just use custom fees.
Mempool is clearing now! It's the perfect time to move your coins for a few cents :)
EDIT: You mentioned Schnorr, so I guess you have a bunch of input addresses? I do think Schnorr would help with that issue so you might want to wait if the fees are still too high for comfort
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:22:42
When you sent you bcash, you sent ONLY your bcash. That worked because of replay protection. The Bitcoin Network ignored the bcash transaction you sent and only the bcash network actually processed it.
That will not be the case with S2X! If you send your S2X to a new wallet your BTC will follow them as both networks interpret the transactions the same way!

@_date: 2017-10-20 15:27:26
probably electricity bill 
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:24:21
Might be true, but who knows how much electricity cost where OP lived at the time and if you run it 24/7 it will still get pretty costly
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:32:50
They can still see their own comment and don't notice anything but their comment is invisible to everyone else
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:58:23


sorry, pet peeve

I don't know if I can speak from experience but in case I was shadowbanned anywhere, it apparently isn't bad because I have no idea if it ever happened lol
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:21:35
Haha such a weird question 
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:16:51
I don't need to! It's math!
There is no right or wrong!
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:47:03
surprisingly good one.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:35:34
You join the 21 club by owning at least 21 bitcoins, which is ~~exactly~~ a little more than 1/1,000,000 of all bitcoins to ever exist (because some got lost and stuff).
That means that if bitcoin should overthrow all other currencies, you own 1/1,000,000 of all the money in the world
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:07:25
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:07:08
I know, right?
I went over to check there too and well I guess they are just misinformed on some things.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:20:17
Happy cake day man :)
@_date: 2017-05-03 17:37:20
well, obviously.

In the (probably not very near) future that could mean internet with almost no latency.
That would be absolutely insane!
@_date: 2017-06-24 10:59:59
2 million?! That is NOTHING for a decentralized internet.
Should be at least 2 billion!
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:20:37
Just never sell.
It's that easy.
