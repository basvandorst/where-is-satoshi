Nonsense. Mine was $50k per week then all of a sudden dropped to standard $10k per day, so in early Dec I put in a request for increase through Gdax along with a copy of my bank statement. Took about 2 weeks and it was approved and increased to $50k/day. Too many conspiracy theories out there when all it is that Coinbase is swamped and/or people are not providing the proper documentation. 
Maybe it’s because I own a couple businesses myself but as much as I’m not a fan of coinbase for many other reasons, I understand that sometimes no matter how hard you try you just can’t catch up to the demand and delays become inevitable. 
Edit: I know $10k per day is more than $50k per week but I’d rather be able to move multiple btc in one day than having to do $10k per day multiple times.

Binance put safeguards in place back during the original China FUD.

Good for you man! Love posts like this!

No you are locked in at the point of purchase so you will receive your full purchase amount of 0.4BTC

I never put a stop limit before because I never sold my BTC through GDAX before. What are the risks of say, putting a $12,000 stop limit and a ridiculously high sell limit like $5K over current price before going to bed every night? I understand we can dip to $12,000 and trigger a sell and go back up but at least you sleep better at night right? Can somebody please explain? Thanks in advance

Short answer would be no. Even crypto to crypto trading may not be considered like-kind exchange as per IRS code 1031 and be a taxable event.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:35:57
congrats! everyone should have an endgame when investing in crypto. I haven't figured out mine yet bc my exit strategy changes daily. Greed sure does devious things. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:20:01
so you never had much in to begin with
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:25:22
I'm not predicting the bottom here but if $15-16K is the bottom despite everything going on I feel more confident about BTC today than I did yesterday.
Disclaimer: I've been in BTC since 2013 and seen a whole bunch of shit
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:25:07
on Gdax go to LIMIT&gt; SELL&gt; choose Amount of BTC you want to sell and Limit Price (i.e. in this case $19000) and if you want to customize time in force you hit advanced but the default is that the order is good til cancelled. Hope this helps
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:43:44
depends. coinbase insures up to $250K of your money and coins in case THEY get hacked. However if YOU get hacked and you lose your money and coins then you're screwed
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:55:47
yep and gdax crashing right when it gets good and "next week on BTC-Z..."
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:54:17
I hope you're right about price being controlled by supply and demand. I mean I read something like $100 Billion in new money since Dec 1. That is not Aunt Jackie and Uncle Frank buying $100 btc for the first time after Johnny told them about Coinbase during Thanksgiving!
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:45:07
i must be one of the lucky ones. sent several bitcoins from binance to gdax and took less than 45 minutes each time. meanwhile it took almost 24 hours to get my OMG out of MEW

my buddy sent me a youtube video of Andreas Antonopoulos speaking about CME at some Q/A event (he has an unpaid position on some sort of advisory board) where he said miners may short a small position to cover their overhead and that he was also pleasantly surprised at how many of these "wall st/finance guys" were actually on "our" side, meaning they don't necessarily want to see BTC price go down or go away altogether which seems to be the popular opinion amongst us crypto investors. I was rather relieved to hear that. Also CME has a 20% short circuit protection meaning if the price goes up or down 20% in one trading session, they stop trading for the day. Don't quote me verbatim but it was something along those lines. I think futures will reduce volatility while price surges up. After 2 days of stressing if I should convert all my btc to fiat and wait on the sideline for the major correction I decided to just hold and protect myself with some stop losses. I did however sell off all my alts for btc. Sorry for rant.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:20:54
history isn't necessarily bound to repeat itself in crypto. I was a holder through 2013-2016 bear market and it was a completely different time, different market. Even as a holder I had doubts about the legitimacy of bitcoin but now its different. IMO no way do we have a 70-80% crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:38:44
your coins and money are insured up to $250K at coinbase in case they get hacked. however if your computer or phone gets hacked and you lose your funds than you're screwed

depends on your mortgage lender but call them and they usually give you a pay off quote. hopefully no additional fees. depending on where  you live don't forget to set aside capital gains tax. nothing raises a red flag like a mortgage being paid off without declaring any significant income change
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:08:46
This. Every time.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:01:30
IMO, no way we will see 3-4K. A major crash at this point is about $9K. If indeed the 10th ends up being a blackswan event for BTC, I see us dipping into high $8K like last time before recovering back over $10K and then investors can decide if we are on a serious downtrend or uptrend due to futures.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:28:07
NOTHING about Crypto is rational when it comes to price. Most have 100's of millions, if not billions MC without even having a working product. Its all speculation.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:15:40
my buddy is a stock trader at a large brokerage; he said the days of a huge market crash crippling the entire market are likely over because there are so many bots doing high frequency trading as well as people waiting on the wings. I feel the same can be applied to the btc market. Unless its a completely unforeseen black swan event, ie US criminalizing btc, you can bet people will buy the shit out of a 30% drop. Look what happened two weeks ago when we went from $11k to $8750 in minutes. Even a quicker rebound. A drop of anything more than 50% will most likely be a slow gradual drop giving people plenty of time to get out if they believe it won't rebound. If you're a bit concerned like me about the effect of btc futures affecting short-term profit keep some of it on the exchange and of course protect yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:13:55
and why would this be funny to you to see people suffer? never understood people like you. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:26:44
lol ppl calling $15K a crash. hopefully those people sold so price can stabilize even more. What a time to be alive
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:08:06
OK so I was right and wrong. According to coinbase, ALL digital currencies are insured.
"All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result."
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:29:49
Its funny because for some reason I feel more comfortable now about the long term prospects of bitcoin than I did when we were pushing 20K. Hopefully this pushes out a lot of the new money and creates a nice price floor.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:31:37
you're probably overtrading and very impatient. pick a good coin and just hold and stop fomoing. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:06:43
Bitcoin has prevailed EVERYTIME and this time will be the same. 
Bitcoin has been killed so many times its a zombie&gt; 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:12:53
to me this is the million dollar question.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:20:48
why not. they're both unicorns
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:29:21
LOL yep they say one is born every minute right
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:57:10
Me too. The timing of all this is leaves me skeptical. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:54:20
Problem is this last cycle is the first one where the masses who otherwise would of never invested in crypto if it weren't for FOMO bought in and it clearly hasn't worked out for them so it's going to take quite a bit of convincing for those who sold at a loss to come back in
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:56:53
we re both making assumptions that can't be proved but I'm going by my 'non crypto' friends who fomo'd at into BTC, ETH, LTC in Dec via coinbase. It can be argued they shouldn't have been in the space to begin with but they dumped in the last month or so and swore off crypto investing for life. Demographics: 38-45 upper middle class males
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:15:01
If I were him I would sell now and rebuy immediately to harvest that loss against future cap gains. No wash sale rule in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:08:35
Thank you for doing this. As a US citizen if I hold coins on a foreign exchange like Binance, do I have to file an FBAR report?
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:35:03
Thank you very much. I already file fbar for my own business. Going to be very difficult to pinpoint the exact date when I had the most money in exchanges as required by fbar. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:16:00
I'm not a BTC trader but I would bring your chart to r/bitcoinmarkets
