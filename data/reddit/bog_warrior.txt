A pretty big and totally correct asshole, yes.

Good. People need to fund important shit directly.

Venezuelans have computers, tablets, smart phones, WiFi and 3g, all are extremely widely used. They also have a local bitcoin market. When the currency stabilizes the guy will likely transfer some back into cash. What is your point?

That sucks because I paid my bank extra for a 24 hour transfer.
It arrived via support about an hour after I put up this post.

Weird... I sent a 24 hour eu to eu transfer to gox over a week ago, and their support are not responding anymore.
Any advice on what I should do?
65 BTC worth of euros...

Fuck them.
I knew it was multiple russians. They were not good with emailing back on support for compliance issues, but when they did, you could tell that the writing style changed while the name at the end did not.
Offered no phone support or number.
The chat support had no power.
And I am still left with a useless, locked account with 20 grand in it that I'll never see.
BTW completely legit work and money stored in it. I was travellng and working online, freelancing and paying other freelancers.
Fuck LR, they are thieves.

Yeah... I was trying to get it out of LR and put it nto BTC as savings since 2011, that makes it even worse

Why does everybody refer to Satoshi as a singular person?
My bet is that those BTC are lost forever.
The absolute best thing "he" could do with it would be not to trade them for fiat, but to buy a bunch of goods with them.
