Under traditional US financial law (e.g. the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act described [here]( I would expect existing financial privacy laws to protect in a case like this - not from having his account closed, but from having a Coinbase rep share information about his transaction publicly.
What's interesting here is that Bitcoin has created a mess of everything - is Coinbase in fact regulated as a bank and therefore governed by the same privacy laws? (in which case perhaps a law was broken when they disclosed the user's transaction on reddit?) Or does the fact that *all* Bitcoin transactions are public mean that no one has an expectation of privacy around their transactions? (and therefore regardless of Coinbase's regulatory standing there would have been no privacy violation)
In any case IANAL and all that  (and personally think Coinbase is a pretty stand up company), but it is pretty interesting how Bitcoin continues to make a mess of all the traditional financial laws.

That's a false dichotomy. Not all use cases require fully decentralized consensus. There may be usecases in which a limited set of actors need to achieve consensus in a trust-less way. In such a limited case (e.g. a consortium of banks clearing payments amongst themselves) "bitcoin as a currency" may not be needed to incentivize participation.
Regardless of whether this proves warranted, the idea that there might be usecases that don't require fully decentralized consensus and which aren't served by standard, private databases is hardly ever discussed on this sub, and when it is is often met with fairly aggressive suppression. As mentioned, to an outsider this does look like elitist fanboyism.

I'm unconvinced. 
Even if the voting participants are designated they would benefit from a deterministic, trustless way to determine the transaction history or ledger. A blockchain solves that problem elegantly in a way that a shared database wouldn't (who stores the master copy? How are concurrent updates reconciled trustlessly? How to manage malicious actions by one of the voting members?)
heck even if the individual "miners" aren't designated I'm not sure the system is necessarily "easily attacked". Each voting participant is motivated to bring more mining power online if they detect the other members doing so (just to ensure they retain equal voting power) - just like with bitcoin one of the voting participants would have to hire more power than the other participants combined to co-opt the ledger. Etc... etc...
My point is not to solve this problem - I wish only for it to be discussed, or, at a minimum, not be so aggressively and conspicuously dismissed.

That's not entirely true. Ownership is a legal term, and he certainly does *own* his bitcoin. For Coinbase to take them without some extenuating legal circumstances would be theft. It's true that the US government can seize and freeze funds held at banks (and Coinbase) for a number of reasons - but until they do, he definitely *owns* those coins.
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:35:29
Let's take law out of the equation (as I realize many here don't recognize the authority of any national government): in storing your coins with a 3rd party you don't relinquish even your *moral* right to those coins any more than than you relinquish your moral right to your car when you leave your keys with a parking attendant.
I agree there are risks in giving up *control* of your private keys but there are also risks in failing to personally secure your keys properly. How you choose to weigh those risks can impact whether you lose your coins, but it doesn't impact your moral right of ownership.
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:17:11
You're being pedantic. True, Bitcoin is more pseudonymous than anonymous, but the distinction in this case is fairly technical. If you're going to claim "misinformation" on a fairly commonly (and reasonably) held belief, at least elaborate.
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:30:40
Well said. All too often people confuse "ownership" with "control". Just because you store your coin with a 3rd party does not mean you implicitly relinquish your ownership or right to those coins. You do, however, give up some control and with that take on some risk of theft or loss.

The problem is this average user has to have the foresight to create many low value paper wallets, otherwise when the try to transfer a little bit from cold to phone they have to import their entire savings first - which is a pretty huge security risk.

There's a spectrum of use cases between "private" and "fully decentralized." A consortium of 5 banks may want a trust-less way to share data between themselves. It may be that an adaptation of "blockchain technology" which does not rely on "bitcoin" is a well suited tool for that purpose. Funding research towards building that tool doesn't seem any more or less valuable to me than funding research towards any technology.
I honestly don't understand all the hate on this subreddit directed towards even the mention of "Blockchain without bitcoin" - it's either a viable technology or it isn't. And if it isn't viable, that will become clear as all these funded companies collapse.

In the words of your comment "sounds superficially plausible but crumbles immediately upon inspection"

Honestly you have some great points: the fact that encryption has a been a boon for the economy despite early opposition from the government and the (I imagine true, but unconfirmed) statement that utility trumps government approval.
But why did you have to throw in the unsubstantiated and likely unprovable hyperbole in the middle? "Trillions of dollars worth of value that was created would have been left unrealized." Nobody knows or can know what would have happened to the *US* economy had encryption been subject to greater regulation (let alone the global economy). So why make such a confident statement when you clearly can't have any real confidence?
"Key qualities of of a currency: privacy", my personal opinions aside, many people would disagree with that statement - so why present a subjective opinion as objectively true?
Your rhetorical devices weaken what is, I believe, a fundamentally good post.

While I'd love it if the law were clearer in general, and would love it if the world were internally consistent, unfortunately neither is true.
* Different branches of the government have different rules and definitions. The IRS may not consider Bitcoin a currency, but that has little bearing on Fincen definitions, SEC definitions, state definitions, etc...
* Money transmitter licenses aren't granted to technologies, they're granted (or withheld) from companies. A company can use Bitcoin in any number of ways, some uses might cause that company to be classified as a money transmitter.
* Sadly, there is no law forbidding "having it both ways"

Thank you - my original issue was not so much for the points made but for how they were made. Concerns which you've addressed in your reply.
Were I to play devil's advocate I could quibble with some of your points here - but since I honestly do agree the world is better with freely accessible encryption and that privacy is one of many important considerations in currency, there's no need.
In either case your latest reply, in laying out the thoughts behind your assertions, furthers the discussion whether I agree or not. And for that: thank you.

To be fair we're talking about retirement savings here, so a 14 year window (2000-2014) is only right if you were 51 in 2000. We really should be looking at a 47 year window for our hypothetical 18 year old. I don't have 47 year data on the S&amp;P, but this guy has 25 year data: 
And the 25 year average annual return for every year since 1955 has been about 10%. So assuming an average 10% annual return  for our 18 year old is at least supported by past data.
Many financial advisors (even those paid by funds or with otherwise glaring conflicts of interest) will actually suggest moving from equity to bonds (or some other less risky asset) as you get closer to retirement. So in 2000 your hypothetical 51 year old would hopefully have moved a bunch of his retirement investment out of the S&amp;P. The 18 year old referred to the GP, however, is probably still a-okay having invested in the S&amp;P cause he has another 33 years before retirement.
That said the big problem in all this isn't the historic returns of the S&amp;P, but that past performance doesn't indicate future performance and the US economy could completely collapse sometime before little Bobby 18 year old is able to retire.

It's always a question of risk to reward. They've clearly made the calculation that the reward of high net worth customers outweighs the risk of servicing those customers in Cyprus.
@_date: 2015-07-23 14:38:59
Exactly. I'm not saying the situation doesn't suck for those in Cyprus, but I don't see why Barclays would be expected to take on that risk rather than the ex-pats themselves.
Fundamentally this is a question of free market vs. social protections. Which I fully acknowledge is a complex one. If I paraphrase your "comment" it seems you lean towards the side of social protections in that you expect Barclays to act against its best interest to protect potentially vulnerable members of society.
In many instances I'd actually agree with you, however in this case I don't.

That's a bit of an exaggeration. This is a specific service: UK bank servicing non-UK residents living in a country with recent and drastic financial upheaval. All of those expats could open domestic Cyprus accounts.
Sure it's a dick move by Barclays - but it's really just the free market at play. The alternative would be to have the UK government pass a law requiring Barclay's to service all UK nationals regardless of where they live.

@_date: 2015-07-23 23:04:44
I agree. 
1. Access to the financial system should be a right
2. The details of how it would work in this particular situation (i.e. citizens living abroad) and whether it could work at all under the current banking system are not particularly interesting.
3. Bitcoin, if/when it becomes a viable alternative to a bank account, is exciting particularly because it solves points 1 and 2.
@_date: 2016-02-17 01:39:49
Yep. I don't see it as an attack so much as an attempt to corner the market in cross-border payments. A potential monopolist/oligopolist just has to raise the tx price enough to drive out most individuals. Even at $1000 per tx it could still be profitable to the oligopolist - they could charge individuals $2 to send money oversees, and aggregate 1000 individual remittances into a single onchain tx. They make a profit of $1000 ($2 * 1000 - $1000 tx fee) and users still see a benefit ($2 for a remittance) - so everyone wins... except for we're back at a fairly centralized system.
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:08:14
More like: "hair-cut for accounts &gt; 100k; close *Barclay's* account &lt; 100k" else open an account with a domestic bank.
~~We really should try to reserve our moral outrage for things that deserve it.~~
EDIT: removed last line per @_date: 2016-02-16 22:10:00
Yep. Agree: the price would go up. Not suggesting this consortium would want to kill bitcoin, quite the opposite, they'd want to control it to their profit. If the Tx fees go high enough (even if 1 BTC = $10,000), individuals won't be able to use it, instead they'g go to the consortium (or perhaps one of a few consortiums) to send money - just like we do now. These consortiumes would then aggregate a bunch of indidvual transfers into one Tx in order to afford the high tx fee. If 1 Tx costs $1000 to send, a company can still make a profit if they aggregate 1000 individual transfers and charge those individuals $2 each. An individual on their own, however, won't be able to afford the $1000 price tag to send money p2p.
Not necessarily a problem if there are enough businesses to provide choice to consumers and break up any sort of oligopoly power.
@_date: 2016-02-17 03:50:37
I don't really see it as an attack. Even if the "consortium" is actually 10,000 individual businesses acting independently and each bidding the tx fee up to $1000, they will have priced out the individual. At 10,000 businesses there's enough decentralization to, probably, satisfy most use cases (ie hard to censor 10,000 entities). But at some number lower than 10,000, we start seeing the centralization currently at play in the current banking system (globally there are thousands of banks)
@_date: 2016-02-17 01:42:05
Agree. Great for anyone with bitcoin today. And possibly great for even non-bitcoin users who want to send money overseas (potentially lower cost and quicker than the current alternatives) - but probably not great for someone who needs a decentralized solution (since the high tx fee would centralize onchain tx with companies that can aggregate a lot of remittances into a single tx)
@_date: 2016-02-16 20:37:31
You mean the transaction fee, right? I agree, you're probably right: the fee would go up. But it would likely price most people off the blockchain, no? In and of itself not a problem - so long as there are enough businesses who can afford to participate on the blockchain that the control remains decentralized.
@_date: 2015-04-03 12:45:04
I don't know why this is being downvoted. It's not only possible but commonplace with traditional online banking. Just because Bitcoin is great (and it is!) doesn't mean we should try to suppress information about alternatives. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:05:31
Definitely this sort of a IoT blockchain would not be applicable in all situations. I agree you probably wouldn't want to trust life critical interactions to without some more guarantees on compliant behavior. But in this limited application the consumer sort of serves as an arbiter of last resort - if a device really is attempting to corrupt the system, they'll be unplugged, thrown out, and likely the vendor will see their sales drop. The goal, I guess, of this system would be to *limit* how often the customer has to police their devices - it should be an exception not the rule. i.e. ideally the dvices can sort it out themselves most of the time.
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:36:13
Why do we assume that incentive has to be a token? 
@_date: 2015-04-03 12:52:49
Ouch, you pay $300 or more to send $6000? I think you need to find a new bank/remittance provider. I've never seen rates that high for such a large remittance.
@_date: 2015-04-03 13:04:48
My sympathies. For clarification: does the $5,000 / 5 cent transaction you mentioned in the original post replace your typical wire to Poland? i.e. can the recipient spend the Bitcoin you sent them? Or do they need to convert to PLN? 
Cause it sounds like your Polish remittance is so expensive because it includes a currency conversion, which your Bitcoin transaction does not. Again: Bitcoin is great, but it does not get us all the way there in most cases. It's not really apples-to-apples to compare it to a full USD-&gt;PLN (or EUR-&gt;PLN or whatever-&gt;PLN) remittance if you leave out the USD-&gt;BTC part and the BTC-&gt;PLN part.
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:17:45
I'm not sure that's true. But it's an interesting point. I haven't given much thought to whether or not a 'token' is some sort of core axiom to which all other concepts can be mapped.
What about a situation where  all participants benefit by having a working ledger/message database. They're incented to mine as that's the only way to *guarantee* their messages are added to the ledger in a timely fashion - but they're also incented to include the messages of others into the ledger since bidirection communication is a requirement for their specific appliction (e.g. IoT devices communicating within a household and using a "decentralized" ledger to handle communication amongst them - they all benefit by sending/receiving messages and all are incented to mine new blocks).
In this case the incentive isn't a token, but it's the ability to participate in a functioning, purpose-driven ecosystem.

The question posed by OP was not "can you make a voluntary, inclusionary blockchain without a valuable token?", it was how could a block chain work without bitcoin. That to me is an interesting question in its own right. I, like you, can't think of a way to simulate the voluntary/inclusionary/permissionless aspects of Bitcoin without bitcoin - but it was not the question asked.
As for the first half of your answer: thank you for engaging in a discussion - and let's be clear here: I do not know the answer nor do I have an agenda. Like most discussions in the real world, the purpose is to further our understanding of a topic. With a simple distributed database how would the devices protect against a bad actor? (e.g. A samsung device that that plays nicely with all devices except for Google devices which it attempts to sabotage by feeding bad data). It seems like a consensus mechanism is one way to protect against that - the Google device would compare the chains it gets from the samsung device against those it receives from the other devices in the apartment to determine what the "right chain" is.
Now maybe I'm guy with a "consensus" hammer seeing nails everywhere, and there's actually a much more efficient way to achieve this sort of data sharing with partially trusted neighbors - but then again is not this sort of open discussion the intent of a question phrased like "How would it work? Think outside the box!"?
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:23:35
I really don't understand why so many on the sub are opposed to talking about alternatives to bitcoin. I agree implementation and talk are different beasts, but there's still value in talk (if you disagree, I'd urge you go back and read all the discussions Satoshi had before and during the build out of Bitcoin)
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:31:19
Since bitcoin provides an incentive for miners to mine, what if there were some other, non-token based incentive? 
For example let's say you have a hundred internet-of-things device in your home from different vendors. They all need a way to share data (being connected to other devices, even those from other vendors, increases their value), but don't want any single entity to control the database. So they opt for a blockchain. In this scenario each vendor is incentivized to mine blocks cause that's the only way they guarantee their own device's messages are added to the chain (and if their messages don't get added to the chain, they can no longer communicate and therefore lose value in the eyes of the consumer). Furthermore one vendor behaving as a bad actor (e.g. by posting invalid transactions) is kept in check by the other vendors. VEndors are most incentivized to mine their own transactions *but* they are also incentivized to mine the transactions of other vendors under the premise that connected devices derive their value from being connected which means sending, receiving, and relaying the messages of other devices.

Great. My comment was directed specifically at the trend I've seen to suppress *talking about* alternatives. Delivering a working implementation of an idea is certainly not a precondition to discussing that idea.
To put it concretely: This thread asks people to propose ideas for a blockchain without bitcoin, and even explicitly asks people to temporarily table the arguments against it. And yet the majority of responses, and the most highly upvoted responses, are just that: statements that it's impossible. How can that be productive?
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:48:09

I agree. That's exactly how I interpreted the responses.
@_date: 2015-04-07 23:34:52
Good point. Is the token necessary, though? Given this specific use case where we don't need to create a permissionless, inclusionary system and are content with limiting access to the network to the devices a user has chosen to install in their home - does the token add value or remove it? I'd argue in this case a token might complicate things. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:45:33
Whether you believe they are wasting their time, or they believe they will succeed is irrelevant. Bitcoin and "blockchain technology" are just that: technologies. They work or they don't - there is no subjectivity involved and no need for belief systems.
There were undoubtably many who believed Satoshi was wasting his time in trying to build Bitcoin. I'm glad he didn't listen. And glad IBM and others aren't content to say "the current Bitcoin based blockchain technology is the best we're going to have."

Fine. Hyperbolic misquote retracted. But the point remains: trust is required to do almost anything. Ridiculing the 45,871 people (or was that hyperbole too?) who may have misplaced their trust is a douchey move. Doing so without providing any other meaningful substance is useless and hypocritical.

@_date: 2015-04-06 21:36:10
I don't understand these useless comments about misplaced trust. You do understand that almost any transaction requires trust? Forget for a moment that we don't yet have useful decentralized exchanges or marketplaces - even those require trust: trust that the seller/buyer holds up their end of the bargain and that your "arbiter" passes swift, fair judgment when they don't.
And you do understand that even the decentralized loss mitigation strategies like escrow and arbiters rely a large part on reputation, right? Reputation which is earned through a track record of compliant behavior. By that metric btc-e would be a stellar arbiter as one of the only bitcoin exchanges to operate for years without a major collapse or loss.
Now, fine, maybe btc-e will run off with all the money, and maybe companies will screw us over, but atleast provide some substance in your comment - instead of this asinine "lol, trusting loser. You should grow your own food, perform your own surgery, and build your own house like I do - cause trust is for losers. lol"

Great, glad you're willing to take the OP at face value and discuss possibilities! I'm not sure how merit work, could you elaborate?
What about a situation where all participants benefit by having a single agreed upon ledger. For example autonomous internet connected devices (like smart fridges, security systems, smoke alarms, thermometers). They all benefit by sharing data (the fridge wants to talk to the security system so it know when people come and go, the security system wants to talk to the smoke detector, etc...) but since they're all autonomous and perhaps built by different vendors there's a question of who maintains / stores this ledger.
One solution is for them to create a mini-blockchain (e.g. one block chain per household) and each of them serve as miners. They're incented to mine since that's the only way to guarantee their messages are added to the chain (and therefore can be picked up by other devices) - but they're also incented to maintain the validity of the chain (e.g. allow other devices' messages to be added) since they all gain value through connectivity/communication (a smart smoke detector that doesn't share information is less useful to a consumer than one that does).

I like your rephrasing of the question but would flip the causal relationship. Typically people take on debt in order to fund growth - not the other way around. So the question to me becomes a more philosophical: why do we, as a society, seek growth to the point we're willing to take on interest bearing debt to achieve it?
Note too that we're ignoring other uses for debt. Eg a freelancer might hold a line of credit to help manage irregular project payments, or a young couple might take out a mortgage on a house rather than wait until they're 65 and can afford an all cash purchase.

Good list. The issue isn't that it's impossible but, as your list makes clear, it's very difficult. And, more importantly, opsec is hard - an accidentally re-used address here, an accidental non-anonymous email to a localbitcoins seller there, and the anonymity can unravel. The risk imposed by these occasional mistakes is only amplified by the blockchain's permanence and publicness.

Bitcoin is a technology. As such it has many applications and uses - some involving trusted 3rd parties.

Ah true. And I'd be one of them. I guess there's no way to reduce something so complex as ownership and control to a single flip statement.

It sounds like you're actually more concerned with the concept of interest bearing debt rather than type of currency in use - all forms of currency (e.g. gold backed, bitcoin, fiat) could suffer from the situation you describe. In fact running out of nominal dollars is an argument for fiat since the government can always print more.
That said, regardless of the currency in use, the economy would likely adjust. True there might be a shock if the Fed stopped expanding the monetary base or gold production dropped suddenly or after a block reward halving - but after the shock we'd likely start seeing any number of adjustments. e.g. interest rates would start declining for new loans and banks, faced with defaults on existing loans, would start accepting debt repayment in alternative currencies.

I'll go you one better: if you don't control your private key you don't control your bitcoins. But that's not as pithy is it?

@_date: 2015-03-02 18:02:34
Great it sounds like we're generally in agreement! 
Only part I don't full understand is the "needless" part - what does your interpretation of mainstream economic theory propose as a way to avoid the implications of the sudden, unexpected, and severe shortfall of currency we've been discussing?

I don't believe this is the case. To be sure intent matters in law (e.g. manslaughter and murder are two very different charges which may differ only in intent) - but I wouldn't consider that a "thought crime."
As for money laundering in general - as an individual I'm free to do all the things you mention and as you say it's perfectly legal so long as I'm not breaking another law (e.g. evading taxes, selling stolen goods, etc...). And as a company I'm again free to do all that - however if I offer some of those services (e.g. routing funds, or exchanging debts) to *others* then I am bound by a different set of laws (e.g. the Bank Secrecy Act). 
I'm not sure how "thought crime" factors into it at all.

Thanks, I'll take a look at the video. I can't shake the feeling that without a central body with a central set of laws, the system would eventually devolve into a collection of warring states which in turn eventually coalesce into a single victorious state, as seems to have happened again and again throughout the centuries.
This isn't to say that our current body and current set of laws is ideal.

Yeah I regularly have issues. It seems they use blockchain.info to push transactions and check balances - so when BC.i is down so is KK... Which isn't that infrequent. Support has been non responsive in the past. Guess I should post to reddit.
@_date: 2015-03-31 13:53:29
True that is the saying. But I don't believe it applies in this situation any more than the bad apples of the Bitcoin community (eg hackers and scammers) spoil the entire community. 
The point is: in any organization/community sufficiently large there will always be bad actors. How that organization responds to the bad actors is far more important than the bad actors themselves.

Great. What is the recommended support channel? I've sent a few emails to the support email listed in the wallet and never gotten a response.

Not at all. You have dozens of banks alone in the US. Not to mention non-banking USD services like wires, loans, cash management, etc.. There is a lot of competition. And in terms of innovation Dwolla, Venmo, Braintree, Stripe, and many others have all made great progress in payments and banking innovation.
But bitcoin enables even more competition and greatly lowers the bar to innovation. This is true to a lesser degree in the US, but is super duper true in countries with less developed financial infrastructure and with less early stage startup capital.
For the pedants out there I guess I should have said "The beauty of Bitcoin is it enabled *greater* innovation/competition on the business side and choice on the consumer side."
Unless you're suggesting that you don't think Bitcoin enables any additional competition or innovation?
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:05:03
Gotcha, I'll check out that link. I guess my question is more: what happens if I sign a contract and then decide I don't want to honor it? A business that does this may lose future business (e.g., Amazon), and may not (e.g., A fire department or hospital or other business viewed as critical in times of need). But what about an individual who breaks contract? Or an individual who steals from / commits violence against another? 
EDIT: I just read the link and it looks like the concept of Dispute Resolution Organization (DRO) is introduced as an alternative to more traditional "government". Without more reading (which I should do) I don't entirely see the difference between a DRO and "the state" other than that you can choose your DRO with more flexibility (which is an important "other than" I grant!) - unless of course you live in a town where your neighbors have decided that all townsfolk must use the same DRO, then your choice is again violence, emigration, or acquiescence (as it is under "the state"). It's this last scenario that I see as the how all governments are ultimately born from "anarchy" - a gradual alignment on a single set of rules (i.e. "a single DRO") that makes most of the people happy most of the time.
@_date: 2015-02-26 22:07:36
I believe you're right - in the US MSBs and Money Transmitters are required to define and implement AML policies. If those policies pass regulatory muster (and they must for them to be granted a license) and it's found that the policies were correctly followed, yet someone still used the business to launder money, I don't believe the business is typically found liable.
An example close to our community is BitInstant. One of the charges was ["willfully failing to file any suspicious activity report regarding FAIELLA’s illegal transactions through the Company"] ( So it wasn't that BitInstant was used to launder money, but that they failed to implement the required AML policies.
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:15:55
I've heard the exact opposite rationale given for run-off elections: they explicitly encourage people to vote for non-mainstream candidates.
Consider the US two party system. Most people prefer D to R or R to D, but most people also prefer some 3rd party candidate to either Democrats or Republicans. However since the US does not do run-off elections, voters have to choose between the lesser of two evils - if they vote for their 3rd party candidate, who is unlikely to win a majority, it's basically a vote against whichever main party they prefer.
With a run-off election you allow people to vote their preference first time around which could actually permit a 3rd party candidate to win.
Whether you agree with this interpretation or not it is common enough (see  that your claims of a run-off being some mainstream conspiracy are tough to swallow.

By shrinking government I had pictured an end state where instead of ~200 independent "states" worldwide we ended up with ~200,000 independent "states" with a corresponding increase in inter-state conflict.
But your point about how some countries have relatively stable relationships is a great one. So clearly my fear of 200,000 states with 10,000 wars is missing *something*. Just not sure what.

The answer to your question is: anyone and everyone. You yourself or anyone you deal with can decide under what conditions they wish to do business - even if that means the counterparty in your transaction decides you're a thief and refuses to transact with you. That's Bitcoin in its purest form. 
Any rules applied on top of that free choice are outside the realm of the protocol. If you want to force people to treat Bitcoin as fungible, you're welcome to try. Many governments do try to limit the choice of their constituents - and in many cases for very good reason. But that is not Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 04:37:11

Interesting. You'd already basically answered my conflict resolution question with the idea that rising global wealth/productivity/standard-of-living/etc would support a system of many parties by making conflict less beneficial than peace.
This new point about wealth buying *more* power when there's a central government/set of laws is interesting!
I'll still be voting "big government" in the near future - mostly cause I think today there are enough issues important to me that aren't yet accurately modelled by profit (e.g., healthcare) - but you've given me a lot to think about.
Many thanks.

Chill dude. I was asking a question. No argument, straw horse/man, or otherwise.
I mentioned "without government" because the linked quote ends with "May they reject all systems." 
I know little more about libertarianism than what is discussed on this sub-reddit and even less about Mr. Bastiat. Hence my original question.

I'll give you the benefit of the doubt:
* To state the obvious: phishing and scams are not limited to Bitcoin. If you want a subreddit with daily bologna: 
* Bitcoin and "a third party holding our funds" are not mutually exclusive. The beauty of Bitcoin is it enables innovation/competition on the business side and choice on the consumer side.

If you don't value their services, don't use them. That's one of the beauties of bitcoin: it lowers the barrier to competition. But don't act like Circle is "the man" trying to keep you down: they aren't a huge too-big-to-fail multi-national bank. They're a relatively small startup following the laws of the country in which they operate.
Save your indignation for something that deserves it.
@_date: 2015-02-24 23:49:23
It's hardly sinister. It doesn't take much thought to realize that if you tell someone your idea they might use your idea. And there's no implied compensation: this is a job application, anyone who applies for a job under the premise that the job is guaranteed compensation for that application has a severe misunderstanding. 
There's no deceit here.
Now whether or not you're comfortable discussing your ideas with someone else without the protection of an NDA is a different question. And I admit often a difficult one. But I do have to agree with most ideas have very little value until executed against (and even then the number of failed startups/projects vastly outnumber those that succeed)
@_date: 2015-02-25 14:40:55
We're talking "novel" ideas here - I assume the other commenters here aren't worried about JP Morgan stealing their idea to slice bread or make wheels round. 
And in that case I must 100% disagree with you. There is huge value in execution even in the absence of a novel idea. I pay ppl for services every day whether its an oil change, a hamburger, or to fix a leaky pipe. It's preposterous to think that execution holds no value without a novel idea. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:11:17
That's fair. I'm not familiar with Circle's account closure process - did he ask to have the account closed? (I only see the emails where they claimed erroneously to have fixed the problem)

Mr. Minor meant he does not believe the *term* "bitcoin" will exist, right? If so we gotta sort this terminology shit out. If we take this post at face value we now have:
* bitcoin aka little b bitcoin aka asset
* Bitcoin aka big b bitcoin aka network
* "bitcoin" aka bitcoin in quotes aka the *term* bitcoin
Naw, screw it. I propose we add a couple more:
*  aka shebang bitcoin aka the menacing bitcoin of mainstream media
* bitCOIN aka bitcoin emphasis on the coin aka those cute physical bitcoins
Anything else?

I doubt Mr. Dimon wrote the job posting. JPMorgan Chase is huge, I can't imagine they *don't* have employees on staff who spend at least some of their time on cryptocurrency related tasks. One team exploring cryptocurrency neither confirms nor refutes any strategy implied by an off-the-cuff quote by the CEO.
@_date: 2015-02-09 01:02:08
EDIT: I just skimmed it (will try to read more closely later). It seems like the assumption behind the "protective agencies" mentioned is that any individual client is small enough not to matter in an of themselves. This might actually handle most of the cases, and maybe that's all that matters. But my gut keeps saying: what about the billionaires? Or the drug kingpins? or the churches? What's to prevent them from funding their own "protective agency" that isn't solely motivated by profit, but rather by some other motivation dictated by their employer? e.g. when Joe Billionaire steals your TV his protective agency is not at all interested in arbitrating with your protective agency, and the goons start hitting the street.
It just seems that, in a profit driven system, those with the most money will always take/have the power.
@_date: 2015-02-26 22:20:54
Impervious is a strong word. As you imply, Bitcoin is harder to *enforce* regulation on because it does not need to flow through central institutions which are easy to monitor. But that does not mean regulation does not apply, nor does it mean it is impossible to enforce.
Really what I think you're after is a country where the majority of people feel as you do and vote to decriminalize money laundering. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:02:52
The US Bank Secrecy Act requires banks and money transmitters to ["report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities"]( and to [keep these Suspicious Activity Reports confidential](
These two requirements force many companies to implement fairly "proprietary and unique" verification and monitoring systems. Proprietary to protect confidentiality of the reports, and unique because what constitutes "suspicious activity" can vary greatly from company to company.

How do you arrive at 250,000 jobs created? It sounds pretty preposterous. $314M investment means an average of little over $1250 a year towards each job. And I'd be surprised if the annual revenue for all bitcoin companies even approaches $300M. So where's the payroll coming from?

While the Fed can and does increase the monetary base, this isn't necessary for the system to work (note: loans also existed when we were all on the gold standard).
question basically boils down to "How can banks charge interest on loans without the country running out of money?" - the answer is: loans are often put towards productive work that create "wealth" in one form or another. If the wealth created exceeds the cost of capital: the economy expands. Otherwise it shrinks.
See well written response.

Again, it's not a scam. And calling it that is not only over the top, but does a disservice to all those who have been victims of actual scams.

Fair, I guess I'm not too worried about civil disagreements. I suspect a DRO / decentralized law system could work at least as well as our current system. 
It really is violent disagreements I wouldn't know how to handle. I don't buy that "proper raising" is sufficient primarily because:
* "Proper" is a subjective term which undoubtably varies from household to household
* Peaceful thought gets hard in times of shortage
* Even in times of plenty and with a "proper" upbringing, rational thought goes out the window in any number of everyday scenarios
And even civil disagreements can escalate to violence for any number of reasons. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:38:45
Legitimate (non-trolling) question (cause I haven't heard anyone address it before and don't know the answer myself): without government how are disagreements between individuals or groups resolved?

Do you say the same thing when someone buys tainted meat? "If you're too scared to raise your own cows, maybe it isn't time for you to eat meat"
Do you say the same thing when someone suffers from a medical mistake? "If you're too scared to perform your own surgery, maybe it isn't time for you to get medical help"
This whole idea that every individual in the world should become an expert in, and sole provider of, every service/product that they interface with is ridiculous.
We don't expect people to be expert plumbers, architects, doctors, farmers, or electricians - why should the introduction of Bitcoin force everyone to be financial experts?
Yes "buyer beware" and all that, but the service provider who screws up sure as hell deserves some blame too.

Disagree. "rubber hose cryptanalysis" is a viable threat vector which deserves discussion. Multi-sig presents one form of mitigation and I personally would love to hear of others. Ignoring bitcoin's weaknesses does not make them go away.
If your issue is more with supposed mis-use of this argument in discussions of "bitcoin vs. fiat" then I urge you to do what you've started to here: attempt to lay out why "rubber hose cryptanalysis" is not a big threat as compared with other supposed failings in fiat.
I personally think the whole question of "bitcoin vs. fiat" is overly reductive. Today there are situations and use cases where bitcoin excels and others where fiat excels - and likely those situations will continue to change and evolve over time.
