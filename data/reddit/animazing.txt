@_date: 2014-08-17 08:56:59
Ah sorry, account labels are _not_ saved. I thought you said contacts for some reason. I just tried the decryption key but it worked for me. Are you sure you used the right key for the wallet you viewed? Are you on BIP32 code or on the &lt; 1.9.8 key.
@_date: 2014-08-17 06:44:00
I should probably put a donation address online, I will do that in the next update. I will also make sure account syncing is still working. As you might know a lot has changed since the last official release so it is quite possible it broke.
@_date: 2014-03-18 19:06:43
AFAIK the command "createmultisig" mimics the bitcoind behaviour. Try using it as such. [Docs here](
I doubt many users have tried it though; so it might not work as expected. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 06:41:33
I just looked it up and there are only 637 wallets synced. That means that people who end up using it have quite a few transactions per wallet. I appreciate the tip, you just gave me 2.5 month of service for LabElectrum. By the way we worked on the same project for a while! I also go by Tachikoma :)

Hey guys,
I'm the guy creating and signing the Windows and OS X binaries for Electrum.
I've met ThomasV on multiple occasions, the last one earlier this month when he was presenting at a Bitcoin conference near me.
During this visit I also brought up the problem with our keys and the fact that they hold little value at the moment and we already
discussed options of letting other developers sign our keys so they carry more weight.
It might also be good to note that each Electrum release is tagged on Github signed with Thomas's key as well. So you could also
check an X amount of releases to make sure that key stayed the same. You can view the signatures using git show &lt;release-tag&gt;.
Thomas can also be found on the speaker list of bitcoin2014.com, although I understand this also won't be verification on it's own.
I hope in the following weeks this issue will be solved :)

Although there will be a presale of Ether this is not the business model. The money will be used for funding the development of the protocol and it's clients and creating an investment fund of some sorts for entrepreneurs (this might be you!) who want to create application on top of Ethereum. The for profit part of Ethereum will hold some equity in such companies and thus hopefully earn some money based on that. That money can in turn be reinvested in other Ethereum based start-ups , rinse and repeat! :)
Other then that the Ethereum for-profit part could consult existing companies on how to leverage Ethereum's technology for their own purposes. This could be an other revenue stream.
@_date: 2014-08-17 09:58:02
When did you create your wallet?

Thanks for the mention of **LabEl**ectrum. I made the plugin in March 2013 and since then almost 20,000 labels have been synced. Pretty cool! :)
I have been playing with the idea of monetizing it since I grew out of my free tier for the database. Would you think the service be worth like a euro a month or something?

That's strange. The 0.6.3 patch has been commit over [two months ago]( There is also a branch that uses an un-patched bitcoind and uses sendtx instead. I don't think it's on github yet though. I can look it up if you are interested.

Shopify uses the open source ActiveMerchant library to handle all their payment processing. In theory you could (or let somebody else) write support for bit-pay or a similar service into AM. With a little luck they could add the support to Shopify itself. [Source](

Just a note to people on OS X. 
1. The current dmg only runs on OS X&gt;= 10.7. I'm still not quite sure why that is.
2. Make sure you download the 1.01 release, there was a bug in the initial DMG that wouldn't active the 'send' button, sorry about that :)
@_date: 2012-08-24 22:57:12
Not in Electrum. Electrum can recreate your private keys based on the 12 seed words you were given. Just remember them and you are good to go!
@_date: 2012-08-25 08:25:23
That's ok, it's just the download link :)
@_date: 2012-08-24 23:10:13
Because you control your private keys.
@_date: 2012-08-24 23:14:58
It's not stored anywhere! That's the magic of it. Electrum uses deterministic cryptography to recreate the same public/private key pairs each time if you supply it with your initial seed.
@_date: 2012-11-29 11:13:44

Problem is that Bitcoin has no system to "hold" funds. So the risk is a bit increases, if the "kickstarter" fails then there is no way of knowing you will get your coins back. 
@_date: 2012-08-24 23:23:09
Math is not my strongest suit but let's try it anyway.
Electrum can pick twelve words out of a total list of 1625 words. That leaves 1625 * 1624 * 1623 * 1622 * 1621 * 1620 * 1619 * 1618 * 1617 * 1616 * 1615 * 1614 options or 3e38. Yes, that's a three with 38 zeros. 
I think that leaves a very, very slim chance of finding somebody else's wallet.
(ps. Feel free to correct my math if it's off)
@_date: 2012-08-24 22:59:39
If you downloaded already, please make sure you see [this comment](
@_date: 2012-08-24 22:48:59
Just remember the 12 words, you can recreate your wallet at any time using those.

This doesn't make Bitcoin more traceable. This makes bitcoin send by the original client more traceable. It's a flaw in the implementation not the protocol. Just thought it was good to clarify that.

To be honest, setting up a server is a bit too hard for the average joe. It requires quite a few dependencies that need to be configured to the letter. There is some work being done to make it a bit easier though.
If you are still interested the how-to can be found [on github](
@_date: 2012-08-26 19:16:13

The thing is, we don't need every average Joe to setup a server. It's not like the only way to use Electrum is to first setup a server. It's totally optional. A shell script sounds like a possibility but you got to understand that Electrum is just an open source project. There is no full time developer. So time is very limited. We encourage everybody that is interested to just clone the code and send in some pull requests. Get involved! :)  
@_date: 2012-08-24 23:07:59
Not one address, your whole wallet. The whole wallet can be recreated based on those words. 
When you first boot electrum it will ask you to restore or create a wallet. You will start out by creating one. It will give you 12 words to remember once the wallet is created. Every transaction you do from that point on can be restored on any computer that can run Electrum. 
Ever better is that you can have multiple computers with Electrum on the same seed. If you have multiple computers you could use the same wallet on both.
@_date: 2012-08-24 22:48:26
Your private keys are not stored on the server, they only live on your computer.

I think this is basically the idea. Write a piece of code that can connect to the JSON api exposed through bitcoind.
1. A new customer creates an account on your website.
2. The customer clicks the "Buy" button.
3. You make a request to a Bitcoinmarket-API and translate your current USD price for the game to a current Bitcoin price. 
4. Your website connects to the bitcoin daemon and uses 'getnewaddress' to generate a new address.
5. The address gets saved in the transactions table on your website together with the customer_id. 
6. Your website polls bitcoind for the status for the transaction and the transaction amount.
7. If the tx is validated the customer gets an email with the details for his or her download link or gets access online.
8. If the payment is not done within an acceptable amount of time (say 8 hours) you void the transaction in your database, this to prevent somebody from creating a order now and paying when the value of bitcoin crashes down (not saying it will just to be safe).
I've never done this myself (yet, but I plan to try it out soon), but something along these lines should be possible. 
**Edit**: Added step 3 and 8
**Edit 2**: I now have done this myself and it's fairly easy to get something basic up and running. If you want some help let me know.
@_date: 2011-08-13 09:14:07
I have one suggestion and a question.
1. With your current implementation it's very easy to find the uploaded content by guessing/bruteforcing the ids. This probably is not a problem for one to many sales but perhaps you want to sell your item to just a small group of people making sure nobody else gets access. This might become a problem then. I would make a unique sha1 hash for each uploaded document and use that as identifier.
2. I see no option for DMCA requests yet. There will be people abusing this, I would prepare for this scenario and get some DMCA takedown guidelines up.
Best of luck
@_date: 2011-06-07 09:31:14
Thanks, I will try that out! :)

The author of this post is not an Electrum developer, I don't think anybody on the team likes selling Electrum with buzzwords and so we don't, we don't have influence on how others sell it however ;).
I am responsible for the Lite GUI of Electrum. Which is especially made for beginners. If you feel that Electrum is useless for beginners than I really did fail my mission.
If you don't mind I would really appreciate some feedback so I can try to improve it, I won't rest till beginners have an easy to use client :)

Just an FYI on offline wallets. [Electrum]( can do offline transactions/wallets as well and has the added benefit that it does not depend on Bitcoind. 
@_date: 2013-06-19 10:04:18
Why is it not an offline wallet? It has no internet connectivity; the seed got generated on an offline system, I generate raw tx's that I transfer via USB and broadcast on a live system. That means it's an offline wallet. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:49:14
Because nobody does it. That's the main problem. If more people would work with git master it wouldn't be such a problem but getting people actively involved in testing is proving very hard. 
@_date: 2013-01-13 10:50:05
What hoops do you encounter on the OSX build? I'm responsible for it and for me it's a simple case of double clicking the .app. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 12:41:08
I wouldn't go that far. Last I heard the owner was working on a relaunch and was hiring some proper developers to code it this time.

If you removed your block-chain you will have to wait, perhaps days, for it to sync again. Just wait it out and the funds should all show up again. (Unless you deleted your wallet file as well, but I'm guessing you saved that.)
@_date: 2013-06-19 07:47:59
I've used [Electrum]( to setup an offline wallet on my Raspberry Pi. The good thing about Electrum is that if the SD card somehow gets wiped you still have your seed so you can restore your wallet.

@_date: 2013-01-13 18:17:46
Thank you for taking the time and creating a insightful response, I appreciate it :)
I agree that a lot of the features offered by Electrum are command line only, luckily the last few releases have been adding more and more of these to the GUI. Although we are still not close to implementing everything. I think you really have a valid point and will try to defer some time to adding more command line functions to the GUI. 
The thing I'm still a bit confused about though is your comment "Electrum is almost useless for beginners." it goes against your statement "I can't do anything in the Electrum GUI except the simplest use cases". The idea of the Lite GUI (Although I'm not sure you saw it; boot electrum with -g lite if you haven't) is to strip everything extra and reduce it to something really simple. A amount box, address box and a send button. I think that this interface should make it very easy for beginners to get started with Bitcoin! At least that's what I'm trying :)
