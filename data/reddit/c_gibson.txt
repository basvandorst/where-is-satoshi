Im on your side. I agree with you, I just think that there'll be something to replace Bitcoin in the future that will be able to do all the things you want it to. If that doesn't happen and Bitcoin remains as a good place to store wealth, that is fine by me. Personally, property for me is a good store of wealth. You can also buy collectible items that will increase in value if that is your thing. If you aren't a fan of having many assets, then yes, Bitcoin is a good store of wealth. Feel free to enlighten me on why you think Bitcoin won't get replaced and why miners are good for the world, I am interested. I believe in crypto which is why I am here. Don't hate on the people that are on your team, no one will want to adopt Bitcoin if the community gets mad at anyone that questions it. We should be supporting each other and helping those learn about what it's about rather than calling people stupid or retarded for asking valid questions.

This makes me think that you are the one that lacks vision �� Bitcoin may not be as volatile as many other coins out there for the time being, but stability will come with time when the market eventually finds its feet. And no, I don't think real wealth can be held in any shit coin, I don't know where you made that assumption from. Maybe you should focus on having a productive discussion rather than calling people 'stupid' or a 'retard' but I guess you are unable to do that because... like you say... it's a 'nature thing.'

If/when more eco-friendly coins take over, then I really can't see Bitcoin having significant value in the future. If transaction fees go back to as high as they were Dec 2017/Jan 2018, and continue to grow higher, people will move towards coins with lower fees and faster transactions. Bitcoin has paved the way for crypto but it isn't sustainable in the long run if it continues on the path it is on. 
From my perspective, the only people that benefit from Bitcoin are the miners. There are plenty of other currencies that can do the same thing, and more. The only reason I can see why people would buy Bitcoin in the future is for the sole purpose of saying they have Bitcoin. Maybe I just lack vision, or maybe I'm just being realistic. At the end of the day, Satoshi had a vision, and if that vision is carried on by currencies other than Bitcoin, I don't see it as a bad thing.

The market is so volatile that you literally need to be watching the charts 24/7 if you want to be trading. I did ok trading when you I was watching what was happening but I guarantee you, as soon as you look away, it'll do the opposite of what you thought would happen and it'll screw you. Do some more research and buy coins that you think will be around in the future that will be of use. Don't buy coins saying they will be equal to gold or some yarn like that as they serve no purpose. One I saw that was backed by gold was twice the price of the gold it was backed by and people were still buying �� Don't buy coins for short term gains, you'll lose out. Buy and accumulate over the year and in a few years you won't care so much about the price you paid now. Just my thoughts.

TA signals won't account for random tweets or news that gets released out of the blue. If for example you sell thinking it will go lower due to TA, then a big tweet happens or news is released without you knowing, you just missed the train. These are only my thoughts. Swing trade if you want but you are already panicking about a 10% drop so I don't think trading is for you my friend.

You need balls of steel to be in this market. If you are so worried about it, cash out and invest in safer, less volatile investments. You knew what you were getting into. 10% loss isn't even that bad in this market. If you believe it will succeed then you have nothing to worry about, just stay strong. Good luck ��
