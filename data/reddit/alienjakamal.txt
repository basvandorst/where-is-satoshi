Well to answer your question: I had asked for recommendations here but didn't get any.  Where was the Gemini recommendation when I needed it? :)
ItBit doesn't speak English!  I am trying to write to them about the verification requirements and they can't tell me in an English sentence.  I think they're Chinese maybe?  They keep saying they will not ask for ID (which is cool but weird) and they say they will verify my identity "with dynamic multiple-choice knowledge based authentication questions."
That doesn't mean anything in English, so I keep asking them.  Then they tell me to sign up for an account.  Then I say I will sign up when they explain their verification process.  Then they give me the same meaningless gobbledegook above.
Kraken I've already been through the wringer with.  Cost me a couple hundred hours and they are as bad as any company can be I think.  I might do a full PSA writeup on them soon.
I've never heard of Grayscale.  Maybe I should look into them and Gemini.
Tax documentation is a weird one, yes.  But thanks for the heads up.

I guess I'm confused.  I don't see any way to buy through a U.S. bank account with either of those.  Am I missing something?

That doesn't really answer my question.  It sounds like kind of generic advice for exchanges in general.

I wasn't asking for a list.  I have access to that.  I was asking for recommendations.
EDIT: I've changed my downvote to an upvote because the first on your list was "strongly recommended."  Thank you.

I've already had to upload the ID and address verification.  No questions yet.
My concern is that they'll ask questions I don't have an answer to, and my money will be stuck.  For example, I don't have a passport, just a U.S. drivers' license.  But I guess I'll take the chance.  
Thank you.

That's good to hear!
@_date: 2016-11-16 12:15:47
You specifically recommend all of them?  Even the one I already told you doesn't work for me?  I don't think you're making a recommendation.  I think you're sharing a list.
I'm asking for recommendations.  That means exchanges that you know enough about to specifically suggest that I use, given my situation.  If I wanted a list, I would ask for lists.

Thanks,  I just worked with them.
There was only one problem.  They asked me to enter my SSN in a support ticket (which is the only way they communicate) and then they left it in the unencrypted chat log.  That's unencrypted and on a public-facing web database server, so we had some issues with that.
But otherwise it was easy, and there were no other KYC questions after I sent my ID and address verification.  But I'm doing small amounts by their standards.

How do those help me to buy from a U.S. bank?  The second one is for europe only.

Kraken says that they do support wire transfer, so I wired them some money.  28 days later, after many tech support issues with their website and support ticket system, I was rejected by their payments company because the transaction took too long for me to give the documents.  But I was actually immediate.  It was Kraken that took too long, and now I am banned from SynapsePay.  Kinda messed up, right?
I"m happy to do wire transfer.  Thank you for your three mentions of companies to use for ACH but do you know any that are good for wire transfer that don't use SynapsePay?
EDIT: typos

Ironically I'm going with them because they're *less* anal about KYC than some other exchanges.
What sort of "springing" should I expect?  I've already sent them my ID and address verification.  Can you tell me what else I should have prepared.
They take HUGE fees for the wire transfer, so if they spring something on me that I can't answer, I'll be out $500.00 just for the transfer.
@_date: 2016-11-16 21:39:06
Yes I know.  But my question is which of these you recommend.
@_date: 2016-11-22 01:21:19
I'm trying BitStamp because they seemed to have more relaxed policies regarding KYC.  Can you tell me what you encountered that stopped you?
Can you recommend a different exchange?  I just want to do a couple of transfers and never worry about this nonsense again.
@_date: 2016-11-16 01:04:50
I've downvoted again.  I realized that the "recommended" one isn't for U.S. people, and my OP stated that I am in the U.S.  So all you gave me was a list that I already had, not a recommendation which is what I asked for.
@_date: 2016-11-22 11:09:05
What does "small" mean?  $50.00?  $50,000.00?
To the right person, either of those could be huge.
@_date: 2016-11-22 00:00:44
What sort of KYC questions would you expect?
Also, what do you think constitutes a "larger sum?"  
@_date: 2016-11-16 21:39:28
That's great but my question is about buying via a U.S. bank account.  Either wire or ACH.
@_date: 2016-11-22 00:02:00
What do you mean about native support?  I would think that I would just send my coins to whatever Bitcoin address I want to.  No?
Also, what KYC should I expect from them?  Their wire transfer fees are SO HIGH that I can't risk sending to them and then not being able to answer their questions.
@_date: 2016-11-22 00:01:01
And how long have you been working for Bitstamp? ;-)
