Bobby lee said $400k per coin is not unrealistic if bitcoin becomes a global currency by using the analogy that if he has 1/21million (21million is the total number of bitcoin that could be created) of the world's gold supply which is around 14kg , it is estimated to be around $400k.

Bitcoins aren't stored in a paper address. Paper address (or wallets) just contains the private key for you to access the bitcoins on the public blockchain.

I already created the time machine. I am from the future 50 years from now and I can only go back 50 years in time , so that's why I'm here waiting for the dip to happen.
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:09:51
I think the seed list you wrote down is for another wallet with no coins. No way will your coins just disappear from your wallet , do you have the public key address so you can search it on the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:22:23
No it isn't. That is the most secure way to protect your bitcoin , another way is to memorize your private key or make a seed list out of the private key which is easier to remember.
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:33:46
That's your fault unless the reason you didn't buy it is because you couldn't afford it after you paid your rent and necessities like food.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:58:28
Yes , that's how you restore it. I'm asking are you sure the 12 word seed list you inputted is for that wallet "with" the coins. I think the 12 word seed list you use to restore is from a previous wallet with no bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:38:24
It will , but not by 2028. You will be dead by then when it reaches $10mil unless you live to like 2100.

If you input the seed list of the compromised trezor on to a new trezor, will you need to input the exact same passphrase on a new trezor to recover that wallet? When you try to recover the wallet with the seed list on other wallets like copay , will copay ask for the passphrase after you put in the seed list?

I mean you don't lose anything other than you could have bought more bitcoins with the $500 if it dips. I just want more bang for my buck.

Can't wait for it to dip , so I can buy.......... I couldn't buy alot when it was $2.6k because of coinbase limit.

He is talking about the present , presently Paypal (including venmo) is actually being used by the mainstream masses. Majority of people with bitcoin doesn't even use it for anything and they just see it as being an investment that have high profit margins.

Only worry if you are looking to make a quick fiat profit. I invest for the long haul to watch fiat money become monopoly money , so anytime is a good time to buy BTC. Only use fiat money to stay alive until the crypto takeover.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:23:16
I don't get why people are panicking , don't buy if you only want a quick profit and don't believe in the technology. If you buy crypto because of these moon memes , you are retarded. You should only buy crypto to see it become the future of currency.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:53:45
It should be "The best time to buy is before the crypto takeover". It doesn't matter if you buy 1 BTC at $10k or $50k , that is still cheap because fiat is monopoly money in the future (you may not see it come to fruition , but your children or grandchildren will).
