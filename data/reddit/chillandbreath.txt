Even though the Khazar theory has been soundly debunked, somehow the Jewish people who can often trace their lineage back thousands of years, are still not jewish enough for you people.
Jews trace their roots to Judeah sure but that’s not enough, somehow people find it easier to deny that they are actually Jewish than to deny Jewish indigenous status. It doesn’t matter if that person is Sephardi or Ashkenazi either, apparently there is some crackpot theory for all sorts of Jews who aren’t really Jews.
You may admit that Israel is the land of the Jews, that the Jews are indigenous. Now you just want to tell us that the Jewish people are not “real Jews” good luck with that, I think science is not your friend with that argument.

You have the same obsession as almost all modern antisemites have with the Khazars. It's essential to their Narrative that the "Palestinians" be an ancient nation with an unbroken ancient identity and presence in the land, while the Jews be a modern people with no such physical connection and a borrowed identity. In other words, the exact inverse of the facts.
Ignorant assholes are attempting to deny Jewish peoplehood but they can't even do that right.
The myth of the lily white Israeli khazars oppressing the supposedly indigenous people of color is one of the favorite lies of the anti-Israel left.
Typical of leftists and Islamofascists. Projection and lying are both innate actions raised to an artform.

The BDS Anti-Zionists use comments just like the White nationalists antisemites who use tiki torches to light up Charlottesville march. Of course its anti-semitic.

Bigotry is the hatred and refusal to accept members of a particular group based on nothing but their inclusion in that group.

Common misconception. Dark skinned Jews called Mitzrahi are over 60% of Israelis and are treated as equals. 


DNA lineage is from the father. Jews are traced by the mother.

Those who believe the Khazar theory and conclude that Ashkenazi Jews are "fake" Jews must then believe that Hitler wasted a lot of time and resources on the wrong target. And why his friend the Grand Mufti didn't correct his error will forever be a mystery. The argument leads to nothing more than deliberately confusing the actor with the character he is portraying - unless you also believe in the pseudo-science of the inheritability of acquired traits, you know, those uniquely evil Jewish traits that Jew haters have identified in the centuries before the conversion.
How do people who believe in this "Khazar" theory explain why and how this "mass conversion to Judaism" - something that has never happened in known history - occurred?
Let me guess? After Jews dragged their asses out of Palestine in 135 AD, they were decimated. Had to regroup in Eastern Europe. Probably kidnapped a bunch of Khazar women to breed with. Politely called 'mass conversion'
You are a moron

The Khazar Hypothesis is pure Jew hatred. 
So, to those "I'm not a Jew-hater, just an anti-Zionist" types I say: Perhaps this is so, but being an opponent of Jewish nationalism is a declaration of war on me as a Jew just as being an opponent of Hellenic nationalism (from the 1820s onward) would have given Greeks cause to fight you.
Most anti-Zionists are Jew-haters, and anti-Zionism is by its very nature Jew-hatred (just as anti-Hellenism would be Greek-hatred), but even when Jew-hatred is not the motive, anti-Zionism is illegitimate. Nobody has the right to oppose the Jewish nation's entitlement to the Land of Israel.

Do you have credible sources? The whole khazar theory was discredited. 


Hitler was into genetics too


They are of Arab origin with last names that are dedicated to towns in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. They take pride in referring to their origin.

Jews are not associated with such crimes of ethnic cleansing or genocide.
Deir Yassin massacre, a total farce. We know about the Yazidis, the Syrians, the Christian women in Egypt, Malala Yousafzai, the Nigerian girls abducted by the Boko Haram, ISIS, Hamas: it’s a contemporary problem. These things happen every day. These are the things that some/many Muslims do.

The khazar theory and it's one and only source was discredited by the scientific community. Next your going to say flat Earth is the one true theory and anything else is a Zionist conspiracy.
