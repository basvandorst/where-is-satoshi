Wish I had seen that. Though I do have some listings up to buy @ $450. Maybe those will go through. That'd be nice.

You can get these from  for about $30

There are NO Bitcoin wallets in iOS store. None. There are only tickers &amp; apps for exchanges. Which means you have to trust a 3rd party to hold your bitcoins. &amp; if you have ANY past experience with Bitcoins, you would know NEVER to do that. Remember MyBitcoin.com or how about cryptsy giving away peoples Bitcoins from their pool? 
Apple is anti-bitcoin because Apple is controlled by the same people who control the banks.

But they would have seen all the other listings posted @ the "fair" market value. Why would they decide to buy mine other than lack of availability?

You make it sound like a cop can just go in your home &amp; find a bitcoin lying around as easily as they may find a pencil?

You could pay cash, but you'd have to meet locally. Or direct account deposit, but these were neither. Both of them were Greendots, which I suppose is as anonymous as cash on the buyers end, but for such small amounts?

I didnt mean to rip anyone off. I just posted the listing because i still had some btc i meant to sell &amp; the crash came some what suddenly, so i posted it in hopes that the price might spike again temporarily &amp; i could make the sale at that time. They would have seen the other listings for cheaper sell orders as well...?
