have a look if they already have published the txid. if there is a txid check it on a blockchainexplorer. maybe only a too low fee problem.  the fee you spend to withdraw has nothing to do how much of this fee they used to add to the transaction. so maybe the charge 50000sat but the only use 10000 sat and 40000sat are in their pockets.

How can it be that an ETF is based on Futures ?
Did i misunderstand the article ?
For me the article says that ETF´s will invest in Futures of Bitcoin for their clients and they won´t hold bitcoin.
Thats makes no sense.
A gold ETF has to hold gold for your investment.
You have trust that they really hold it in your name.
So for me a Bitcoin ETF has to hold Bitcoion and not any derivate of bitcoin that is backed by nothing.

if they will use their own coins there is no need to mine them. such systems will not be dezentralized, you only need a few servers and a timer to generate blocks.

That´s a very good idea. Trust your bank on the promise to give ever back your savings and collect interest of 0% while your money looses purchasing power day by day. Within 10 years or much much earlier you magically have lost 50%.

Never store your coins on a third party longer than necessary as you always risk to loose all.
On trezor you control your keys and will have access to the fork coins only it will take a bit longer until there will be a solution by trezor or you synch a core node from the new chain and import the privkeys.

a real democracy can't afford ban something they want to take advantage from. all govs and banksters say blockchain yes, bitcoin no. who do they think should develop it for them. the same people who were forced to shut down their projects because they got forbidden ?
a gov driven bussiness does not work properly, the real experts wil not work for banksters who were the orign reason bitcoin was born. the first centralized gov currency will become hacked at its best. open source does not mean you can use it and thats it. it has to become developed day by day. also there will always be nations which will be bitcoin friendly as switzerland. us has forced them to sell nearly 1000t of national gold and after that past 2008 give up their loved bankerposition of banksecrets. they do know that bitcoin and other cryptos will be the future and they will have back their piece of cake they lost in the past.
should the us decide to ban bitcoin maybe the wallstreet can have a new name -burnstreet. the milleniums know exactly who has stolen their future and they will fight back, be sure.

you need to install bitcoin core v15.01 and start synching. stop core. replace the new by system created wallet.dat with your old wallet.dat and restart core.
you will see your btc balance as soon as the block is downloaded which was created back in the past. if you set a passwort you need it to have access to your funds and the whole blockchain is downloaded. this can take weeks depending on your system. without a ssd garddrive it will take very long. blockchain is around 130gb.
the easiest is if you have a friend you can trust who has a up to date core blockchain running.

wen bu den core client neu installiert hast muss dieser erst alle blöcke herunterladen., erst dann kannst du wieder senden. das kann eventuell lange dauern, je nach hardware auch schon mal eocgen. die blockchain ist ca. 140gb gross. sobald du den block heruntergeladen hast in dem du vor zwei jahren die transaction hattest word dee kontostand aktualisiert. in jedem blockchainexplorer kannst du den kontostand deiner öffentlichen adresse checken. brauchst du direkt zugiff auf deine btc dann installier die breadwalled auf deinem handy. dort kannst du deine privaten keys importieren die du aus dem core client mit dumpprivkey zuvor ausgelesen hast. dump priv key googeln und du findest eine bescheibung wie man das mit der konsole macht
