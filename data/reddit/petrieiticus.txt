It's cool that you want to be right and I'll accept the information you provided, but that doesn't change the fact that you claimed that DC does not "lock up" your muscles, which is obviously false.  I wasn't under the impression that AC **couldn't** do the same thing, but what I was taught suggested that it was less common.
I know now that I was misinformed,but the way you start your comment off with "Acutal evidence suggests..." comes off a little "holier-than-thou" when in truth we were both wrong.  It's an English thing more than a principle thing, feel free to ignore me :P

Neither is "safer," they are simply utilized in the scenarios that they are because of the laws of physics.
AC currents are able to be sent over longer distances as they create less heat through the property of electrical resistance than a DC current would.  To use cables as an metaphor, AC currents are like an Ethernet cable that can go hundreds of feet before needing a repeater.  DC is like a USB cable that can go maybe 20 ft.  This is why we get our power in AC; it is much more efficient over significant distances.  How far away is your nearest transformer?  How about the power plant itself?  DC was never going to be the standard for power delivery to the home.
DC currents are used in electronics because, well, that's the only way the gates and transistors will function as intended.  If you can make a fully functioning computer operate on an AC current you would probably make a shit-load of money as you will have made power bricks (aka AC-DC converters) functionally obsolete.  That would mean a lot for my Small Form Factor build \^.\^

Almost as if a direct current tells your muscles to do one thing and an alternating current tells your muscles to do alternating things \^.\^
It's amazing how much misinformation can be spread by being "certain" of ones wrong answer, especially in binary scenarios like this where its either one way or another.  Even when I feel like I'm certain about things I'll still do a quick google search to make sure I'm not an idiot.
Good on ya for the correction :3
