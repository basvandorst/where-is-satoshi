@_date: 2018-01-25 14:47:22
old news.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:22:19
This was never reported before today. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:37:11
Polk, you're...ok.
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:58:17
Agreed on that.  I like buying through the GDAX exchange although you do have to be a bit patient with your limit orders.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:30:17

Sounds like a smart decision.  Hope he re bought after.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:48:14
Terrible idea.  The should put some resources into helping developing the lightening network and wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:03:46
Wow, his advocating for a digital currency released by the central bank made a little sick.

I think the narrative really needs to get pushed that bitcoin isn't in a bubble, but the USD is crashing against the BTC pair.  That's what many in positions of power in the government and media are either too ignorant, or too afraid, to talk about.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:18:24

Wow, this post is dumb
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:29:14
This is another dumb post for multiple reasons:
1.  No insider trading laws apply
2.  Didn't get into btc so I could cry to the nanny state about things not being fair.  If you want that, go back to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:01:36
Bitcoin has been around for 8 years.  IMO, the internet is still in an alpha stage.  You economist types that think that since bitcoin isn't production ready at this point to replace all currencies crack me up.

@_date: 2018-05-07 21:44:28
Haha, these folks really want to believe that traditional players have this kind of power.  BTC was in full blown mania and was due for a correction.  The only link between between the futures and the price was some believed it would be the catalyst to push the price to 100k and when there was evidence that wasn't going to happen, people dumped hard.
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:03:39

This is good.  It will allow customers to see just how expensive it is to send payments p2p.  BTC, a great store of value, a terrible payment rail for small payments.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:25:53
We need a HF imo.  Let the market decide which chain will survive at this point.  It would be a lot healthier than the BS attacks that are going on for both sides.

JFC, I hate this meme.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:51:33

@_date: 2017-03-21 14:18:48
Seems like a bull trap to me.  A HF is inevitable at this point and should crush the price in the short term.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:13:58


Because many members there are fucking crazy, which leads to being delusional.
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:03:36
IMO, the fiat price must go down as a signal to miners that the market is losing faith in BTC because of this scaling issue.  I don't really see any other reason why a miner would change course from the status quo as the price of btc continues to rise along with their mining incentives.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:03:44
Smart.  Free markets will decide.

There is a reason to unrestrict the blocksize... if you're a large mining pool and you want to control the future of blockchain and who will mine it.
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:48:02
lol, terrible reason for switching.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:37:46
My reasoning is, it will allow users to see that bitcoin is not a cheap payment rail like it was advertised to be.
As for usefulness, btc is still censorship resistant and it's fungibility.
IMO, BTC needs to implement segwit, as well as increase the blocksize to at least 2mb(if not more), to help relieve the pressure of increased transactions on chain.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:27:28
Not for long.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:09:46
Guess the open source police will have the arrest them!  Maybe technically correct, but who gives a fuck.  Fork it, and let the market decide the winner at this point.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:27:02
Lol, if bitcoin forks I'll move to ethereum.  What a shit show.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:34:08
I love how people are so sure of themselves about a hypothetical situation.  
Most people on this forum barely have any skin in the game and love to talk a big game.  
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:33:51
I'm not sure how a fork won't happen at this point.  Seems like we're at an impasse with no possible resolution between core and BU in sight.  It would be kind of a good thing for a fork to happen and let the market decide who should win.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:14:36
I think a HF would be a real event vs the ETF.
@_date: 2017-02-13 22:38:29

@_date: 2017-03-21 17:48:11
Why is he a con artist?
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:16:07
Not afraid here either.  IMO, in the long run the chain that incorporates segwit and LN will be the chain that will dominate.  Once we are headed in that direction the price will follow.  There's just too much uncertainty for the price to breakout.  With that said, I'm still super bullish on btc long term.
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:17:03
This post is a waste.  I'm ready for a HF and letting the market sort this shit out.  IMO, the segwit/LN option is the best solution for scaling and decentralization, but it's time to shit or get off the pot at this point.  There will never be compromise between core and BTU folks.  Maybe if BTC price went way down to hurt miners, but I'm not sure if that will happen.
@_date: 2019-11-19 15:16:05
unless they're already in a short position that will profit from such a dump.

So true.  I wasn't trying to one up OP.  Literally had waited 20 hours.  BTW, transaction finally went through.  Just sucks being in transaction purgatory.  
@_date: 2017-01-11 04:54:07

@_date: 2017-01-10 17:43:55
It's worked about pretty good, most normals I know want to have nothing to do with bittorrent after all the PR with MPAA lawsuits, as well as complexity to download stuff.
@_date: 2017-01-17 14:39:38
IMO, this is the killer app right now for the first world.

@_date: 2017-01-10 03:10:27

@_date: 2017-01-16 22:28:08




@_date: 2017-01-10 16:16:40
Is that a joke?  They could eliminate a very dangerous competitor very cheaply. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:13:50
Bitcoin is a terrible as a cheap, instant payment rail.  It will be a great store of value in the future and it's censorship resistant.  Hopefully segwit and lightening will fix the payment rail part.
@_date: 2017-01-10 19:41:23
My point about bittorrent was that it has had little to no impact on existing players in media distribution/sales.  If there was, folks would be dealing with more than warning letters from ISPs when they've been identified as using the tech.
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:23:57
Yep, this sub is full of assholes.  Your transaction will eventually go through, it sucks having your money stuck in limbo though.  I had to wait 20+ hours the other day waiting for a transactions and it's very stressful not knowing.  Until making transactions is idiot proof, mass adoption will never happen.  It will also never happen when the community that advocates for the technology treats community members like shit.
@_date: 2017-01-30 20:43:00
Ugh, if we can't agree on mathematical facts we're dooooomed!
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:52:14
Really appreciate what you did with Coinbase and PR for bitcoin in general.  Wish you luck in your future endeavors.  
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:17:58


Um, not really when compared to OPs example.  It's marginally more competitive, and a ton more user complex.
I'm a huge fan of what bitcion is and hopefully what it will become.  I'm sure at some point this transaction stuff will get sorted out.
@_date: 2017-01-11 04:53:47

@_date: 2017-01-13 15:02:35
Either 1) it's wasn't profitible or 2) growth didn't meet expectations.
I have no ill will towards anyone who turns their back on bitcoin.  I think they're wrong, but whatever.  I don't give a shit when someone hits a 16 when a dealer has a bust card.  It's their money, if they want to be stupid more power to them.
@_date: 2017-01-12 19:39:25
I used to really like /bitcoin, but it gets littered with garbage posts like this.  So if a company decides to pivot, they're the enemy?  Good luck to circle.  When they supported btc, I loved their services.  Now, I no longer use them and deleted their app off my phone.  That's it.  Don't harbor any ill feelings, but some here get emotional about it for some reason like they're being personally attacked.  It just gets old.
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:50:01

@_date: 2017-08-11 14:54:07
100% this.
@_date: 2017-01-24 17:46:13
Appreciate it.  Yeah, typically don't care about stuck transactions.  This one just happened to be a significant one for me.
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:46:29
Um, maybe this was the point of them publicly talking about.
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:46:29
@_date: 2017-01-24 14:55:07
"People are spamming the sub with posts about tx confirmation delays."
Um, I'm pretty sure I read that right.  It's a legitimate complete when transactions are stuck for over 18 hours now.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:52:31
This is exactly why censorship resistance is the most important feature of Bitcoin. The others are great, but being state agnostic gives it global value imo. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 19:00:44
Honestly, don't give a fuck about the ratings of a money transfer app.  Also don't care about the rating of venmo, square cash, paypal, etc either.  Better things to hold my attention.

Nope.  It's up for me.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:33:09
I'd say more ballsy than genius.
@_date: 2017-01-10 16:53:03
I disagree.  You'd end up with 100 more insignificant copycats that would never reach mainstream support and would then provide no competition.  But we're arguing about hypothetical which is retarded.
@_date: 2017-01-13 14:57:58
This is lame.  If people want to gamble, the government shouldn't step in the way of it.
@_date: 2017-01-24 15:03:13
I hear you.  Still waiting on a transaction from 20 hours ago that is kind of life changing money.  
@_date: 2017-01-08 19:26:38
Maybe those 1 star reviews were fake too. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:23:36
True.  And I'm making the choice to say that I think this will fail as designed.  Wish I could bet on it.
@_date: 2017-01-25 03:48:46
Ugh, cables!
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:21:41
Thanks core devs, for finding new and innovative ways of dividing the community.  
@_date: 2017-01-25 06:08:46
Had a transaction yesterday that took 20 hours. Just got to give it time. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:46:37
Really, alternate non-state sanctioned money isn't a competitor to the the money that the state controls?  C'mon man, you have to know what I'm talking about.  If bitcoin would become mainstream, if would be very harmful to the status queue(the state).
@_date: 2017-01-24 06:07:17
I wouldnt call it spam. I've been waiting over 10 hours on a transaction. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:27:20
Oh, ok.  I'll let the party that sent me the BTC(who I have no control over) know that.  BTW, the fee they paid was more than 10c.
@_date: 2017-01-30 20:42:12
Appreciated the response on this.  Also, not sure that's the correct usage of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.  It's either confusion on how percentages work or a lie.
@_date: 2017-01-08 08:20:05
This is retarded. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 16:00:04
It's very possible that you're both assholes.  ;)  Also, you must of hit a magic button because the transaction just went through.  Finally.
@_date: 2017-01-12 19:02:00
Also, it's sad that folks felt the need to brigade and mass give the app 1 star ratings.  Butt hurt folks need to learn to move on.

Expensive coffee, but pretty cheap lesson on how to find bitcoin txs on the blockchain via partial addresses.

No big deal when you're not the one waiting. Bitcoin sucks as an inexpensive payment rail. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:08:03
Probably has more to do with the fact that finally something(anything) got done.
@_date: 2017-01-13 00:23:37
Nope, I have no loyalty to them.  Why so emotional about a business making a business decision.  If bitcoin wallet services is worth the risk for businesses, they'll invest.  If you don't like circle, build a better circle.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:53:35
People are always so fucking confident about things that they have no way of knowing.  Yes, it could crash.  But, people looking at price now may think, wow I have this free money that might be worth even more money, and they might now hold.  Free opinions on twitter don't mean shit.

As a recent victim of this, I can confirm that all these steps need to be taken.  DO NOT TRUST you cell phone provider to keep you number safe.  It is the weak link.  Since authy can be restored using a phone with your phone number, do not rely on authy for 2fa(this applies to accounts that work with authy directly, ie coinbase, gemini, etc).  Also, if you have sensitive info in you email, do not connect your ph# as a recovery method(gmail will use your ph# as a backup 2fa method if you do, even if it doesn't show as being one on your account).

Ok, so core didn't sign off on the compromise.  So what?  These two camps aren't going to come to consensus.  It's time to fork the project and let the market pick a winner.  This won't happen because both camps are two cowardly to do so because they don't want to take the risk with the token value(or as they call it, the security of the project).  It's all a bunch of bullshit.
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:40:24
By market share, I meant their dominant share of mining resources.  If I were them, I would never activate segwit and enjoy my profits.

@_date: 2017-04-13 14:58:20
IMO, I don't know how segwit will ever be activated with the current operators of the existing mining pools.
@_date: 2017-04-12 17:58:22
Seems like an incredibly stupid move.
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:42:36


Not for bitmain.  The code is working fine for them.  They are mining at a higher efficiency, with higher fees, and the price of BTC continues to rise.  With the current solutions proposed, how can the code ever be updates?
@_date: 2017-04-26 14:33:58

@_date: 2017-04-07 15:00:50
The bitcoin market is signalling(price going up) that it doesn't give a shit about any of this drama.  As long as that continues, we will maintain the status quo.
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:12:11
Very few people are using, let alone even know what is, bitcoin in the developing world.  This echo chamber would have you believe that it's taking off like wild fire, which just isn't true.  Until people are using bitcoin, without knowing that they are using it, bitcoin will continue to be niche.  Kind of like tcip/ip.
@_date: 2017-04-20 21:18:53


Why the fuck we they be urged not to go?  Because those doing the urging figured that those going would be too weak and cave to coming to a compromise?
At this point, segwit isn't going to happen.  IMO, a UASF isn't going to happen either.  So it seems the two camps need to come to an amicable solution to split the project.  Let the market decide on the winner.
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:33:06

I know the best words!  But seriously, why would devs be urged not to go and discuss the roadmap for btc with miners?  


I'm sure it will.  But it appears those that have power/influence are inflexible.  So until they loss power/influence(by moving on, dying, getting bribed) it appears we're stuck at an impasse.
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:40:20
All the crybaby posts do nothing to solve the problem.  If a mining group has found a way to be more profitable than others, it's not surprising that they'd be against giving up that advantage.  So what are the solutions?  Reduce the activation signaling for segwit?  Have pro segwit money invest heavily in mining to achieve the 95% signal?  
It's like the sub has turned into a haven for whiny millennials.  We need solutions, not hot takes.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is weighing a new trading operation dedicated to bitcoin and other digital currencies, the first blue-chip Wall Street firm preparing to deal directly in this burgeoning yet controversial market, according to people familiar with the matter.
Goldman’s effort is in its early stages and may not proceed, the people said. The firm’s interest, though, could boost bitcoin’s standing among investors and fuel the debate around digital currencies, which were initially viewed as havens for illicit activity but are pushing further into the mainstream investment world.
China in recent weeks has banned exchanges that trade bitcoin, fearing the virtual currency could provide an avenue for capital flight.  J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive James Dimon, whose bank is the largest dealer in global currencies, last month called bitcoin a “fraud” and said he would fire any employee who traded it.
Yet Japan’s government has embraced bitcoin, creating regulations to legitimize its trading. India and Sweden have mused about creating their own virtual currencies, and the U.S. Federal Reserve has studied both bitcoin and the technology underpinning it.
“In response to client interest in digital currencies we are exploring how best to serve them in this space,” a Goldman spokeswoman said.
Bitcoin is a digital currency that runs on a decentralized network of computers, rather than a centralized ledger under the control of a central bank or government. Users can exchange value directly, without a middleman such as a bank.
Big banks, including J.P. Morgan and Goldman, have dabbled in the technology behind bitcoin, known as blockchain, and opined on its potential to reshape industries. But they have been wary of venturing directly into a market whose early enthusiasts included anarchists and drug dealers.
As digital coins proliferate and draw interest from professional investors, though, they become harder for Wall Street trading desks to ignore.
Bitcoin’s price has soared this year, from $969 to more than $5,000 last month before pulling back. Ethereum, a rival, traded as high as $400 after ending 2016 at $8. In all, nearly $150 billion worth of digital currencies are in circulation.
Goldman’s seeks to serve a growing cadre of institutional investors wagering on bitcoin. Its effort could eventually entail a team of traders and salespeople making markets in bitcoins much as they do Japanese yen or shares of Apple Inc.
Keeping abreast of the day-to-day cryptocurrency market could also position Goldman to capitalize on further development of this market. Digital-currency proponents envision a world where coins will be widely accepted by online retailers and companies will use the tokens for cross-border commerce.
Already, cryptocurrencies are infringing on some traditional banking activities. Some startup companies that historically might have hired banks to take them public are bypassing Wall Street by selling digital tokens, rather than shares, to the public. Such “initial coin offerings” raised $1.3 billion over the past three months without paying fees to underwriting banks.
Goldman’s effort involves both its currency-trading division and the bank’s strategic investment group, the people said. That suggests the firm believes bitcoin’s future is more as a payment method rather than a store of value, like gold.
Launched in 2009, bitcoin grew as a communal software project championed by cypherpunks, who embraced its technological promise, and libertarians, who cheered its independence from government influence. In recent years, more sophisticated exchanges have cropped up to host trading, attracting professional investors.
Some 70 hedge funds now invest in cryptocurrencies, according to Autonomous NEXT.
Exchange-traded funds meant to track digital currencies have so far faced pushback from regulators, but they could one day give a wider base of investors a way to indirectly own bitcoin and create new opportunities for savvy traders.
Such interest from institutional investors has propelled the bitcoin market to a size that merits banks’ attention. About $750 million worth of bitcoin trades on exchanges every day, on par with the daily trading volume of shares of Caterpillar Inc., the equipment maker.
Already, a handful of nonbank finance firms, such as DRW Holdings LLC’s Cumberland Mining and Genesis Global Trading Inc., broker bitcoin trades for institutional investors that want to buy or sell larger amounts than exchanges could handle.
That is a role that banks could easily step into. Wall Street firms also offer leverage to juice trading returns, and hold assets on clients’ behalf. So far, though, none of the big banks has dealt directly in bitcoin.
For starters, bitcoin is highly volatile. After doubling in price between July and early September, bitcoin lost 35% of its value in two weeks. That exposes dealers to the risk of big, quick losses.
But it also offers an opportunity for quick-footed traders to profit by anticipating price moves and facilitating panicked trading. Volatility has been sorely missing lately in traditional markets, leading to a slump in banks’ trading revenues.
Goldman, once known as the nimblest trader on Wall Street, has struggled more than peers. Revenue in its fixed-income division fell 21% from last year through June, dragged down by poor performance in commodities and currencies.
Already, some of the infrastructure for trading bitcoin is cropping up. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission this summer approved the first derivatives exchange for cryptocurrencies. LedgerX, founded by two former Goldman traders, will clear options and futures that would allow dealers to protect themselves from dramatic price swings and lock in profits.
Many prominent financiers, including Mr. Dimon, believe central banks such as the Federal Reserve will move to shut down digital currencies before they go mainstream enough to rival government-backed notes.
Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman recently took a nuanced view. He said bitcoin is “obviously highly speculative, but it’s not inherently bad.”

YES, THIS!  And that's all that really matters.  All the back and forth of people making their case really does fall on deaf ears.  I'm happy there will be a fork and the market will decide the winner, and the loser can move on.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:07:18
Another shallow attack on Vinny, bravo brave comrade!
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:52:21
Guess that says a lot about you.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:31:57
Fuck the RT propagandist.  
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:27:47
The market will decide a winner.  I'm going to spin up a 0.15 node, but I'm not going to act like some crazed wingnut advertising the fact on twitter.
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:07:30
I don't think it is. All the babies in here crying for government oversight shouldn't be in Bitcoin. They should find a nice private mutable blockchain to get behind. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:54:07
And BTC dumps of course.  Always do the opposite of what the MSM reports on.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:52:59
lol!  change.org!
What a joke.  How about, I don't know, let coinbase know you want an answer on this issue, if they don't answer, stop using their services.  Fucking millennials.  
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:31:23
I guess I'm calling into question the integrity of OP.  As far as Matthew Roszak and insider trading, IDGAF.  I don't really care if he did it, I'd be more concerned that he was dumb enough to get caught.  
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:00:24
yay for decentralization for the masses, who can afford the disk and bandwidth costs!
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:12:50
This is a dumb request.  His blockchain is competing with BTC.  Best way to get him to move on is to get user's to choose BTC over BCH.
@_date: 2018-07-19 17:57:54
And this is how you lose credibility when trying to get mainstream support for a project.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:31:54
2006,  Weak ass shit.
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:00:59
first thing that I was thinking.
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:14:55
Yeah, I'm sure if he wanted to do that he'd leak the info he's investing in crypto.  Fucking dumb.
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:21:43
Probably not the bottom though.
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:57:28
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:19:16
Is this a fucking joke?  This is serious Obama hippie shit. Change.org, pathetic. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:37:21
This doesn't seem real, wow.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:57:54
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:32:25
Why not sell, take advantage of the volatility
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:56:33
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:03:46
Because the core devs want to make sure their blockstream venture is successful with layer two payments.
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:22:19
I disagree.  I think it's obvious to see it's lined up with Barry Silbert's tweets about a compromise.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:43:08
That's what happens to cheapskates!  /s
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:39:57
 lol
@_date: 2017-05-19 04:34:58
Yawn, wake me up at 2k
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:50:30
Then you must be new to the internet, and have no fucking clue what a troll is.  Good luck.
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:53:31
So a miner, who should be motivated by greed, is acting greedy?  
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:23:32
100% agree.  I think litecoin's devs are great, just think btc's has a larger dev community with strong skills.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:17:23
Only way the price can stop falling is if hodlers can be convinced to continue to hodl.  I guess dumb memes can help do this...
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:03:28
The asicboot hack was known about years ago and should have been corrected.  Instead, it wasn't a priority and now a mining pool has enough power to make sure it never gets corrected.  As long as BTC price is high, the status quo is the future.  You can cry all you want about how it's unfair, but the system was setup to reward greed, and that's exactly what's happening.
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:05:47
Nothing Ill gotten about it.  Code is the code. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:00:31
That was the top for the day. Also, I didn't think the list was legit.  Go fall down some stairs dick. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:11:32
Yeah, friendster had some of that. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:51:07
Wow, you're a real dick on the internet.  I never attacked you.
FYI, I think the status quo is fine with bitcoin.  I don't mind expensive fees for now.
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:51:42
lol, 9 storefronts....mainstream
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:21:25
Yeah, that doesn't sound right to me.
@_date: 2017-05-05 01:36:21
People should stop shitting on a guy who bought 75k house for 10k. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:13:23
I believe that if you play the game better than others, you deserve the reward.
The asicboost issue has been known about for a while, and hasn't been fixed.  That's the real issue.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:07:58
Fuck this attention whore.
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:35:32
Not a glitch, just a feature of having small blocks.  
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:01:52
Fair enough.
@_date: 2017-05-05 01:37:26
I think it party appreciated because the USD is garbage. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:15:16
&lt;&lt;&lt;Every single statement t you have made since my last post in response to me has been false.
You must have a reading comprehension problem then. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:53:44
Lol, that was the top!
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:51:14
Sarcasm, the tool of the weak.  
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:01:12
Well it appears he went from being a cool as shit hacker, into a puppet for the Russians.  So that's cool, I guess.
@_date: 2018-07-19 21:15:28
They both suck, but having the belief Putin would be better is crazy.  The point of posting was it's hard to take a project seriously when commits come from devs like this.
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:28:46
Seems like a funny guy to me.
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:14:14
Kind of think he would have done this earlier with his connections in the poker world. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:24:51
well, I guess we'll never know what's causing the sudden uptick other than more buyers than sellers.  Guess all posts commenting more than that should be replied to by you with that link.
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:08:42
WTF, I'm not a liberal.  Just saying assange is an attention whore and used russian data to boost his profile.  
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:29:51
Dude, wtf?  Didn't attack you, was talking about Assange, who's an absolute attention whore.  He'll do anything to be put in the spotlight.
Wikileaks has done some great stuff in the past, but they've been manipulated at a vessel to influence global elections, and Assange's vanity has made him blind to that.  
Also, why the fuck is this being posted in r/bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-03 16:55:42
He's probably right, but it ain't gonna happen.  95% support for segwit only takes place after a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:02:06
Thanks core devs.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:55:06
This is great news, I'm not sure how anyone would be against this.
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:04:16
And calling me a liar, without knowing shit about me, is being a dick.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:55:56
Yeah, this shouldn't turn into some kind of bullshit bill that goes through in congress with everyone's earmark.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:57:17
This post is commical.  It doesn't represent what he said in that post.  Fucking hate both /bitcoin and /btc at this point.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:23:40
Not a troll.  Just want BTC to succeed.  Status quo isn't working to great for p2p payments, Segwit without 2mb HF ain't going to happen, UASF ain't going to happen, and crying about it by many folks on this sub ain't doing shit.  Need folks in power(those controlling large amounts of hashing power, or those who have great influence) to change their minds or die for change to happen at this point.  Segwit + 2MB HF seems to satisfy both sides.  
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:34:08
Lol, yeah crashing before it exists.  I think bitcoin cash is dumb btw.
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:05:55
I'll be optimistic when there's a chain split.  IMO, consensus will never be reached and it's taking forever to rip off the band aid.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:52:30
Development community and security.
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:45:18
yep, must be because btc is mainstream!
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:11:01
It means nothing.
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:19:05
Seems a bit late to the party.
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:53:27
Did I insult your liberal sensibility?
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:18:52
I wish it would only take 2 years!  UASF isn't happening, just like the compromise isn't.  The status quo will reign supreme and litcoin and other alts will reap the benefits.  Bitcoin can be a settlement layer with high transaction fees, and I'm fine with that.
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:59:23
This is dumb
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:29:58
WTF dude.  I want segwit adoption.  My point was the threshold for segwit adoption is so high, 55% doesn't mean shit.
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:30:11
I think it will climb until it drops.
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:21:21
This has always been true.  Some argue that this only kicks the can down the road, but if the LN really is as great as most think, 2mb blocks should be enough for quite some time.
@_date: 2019-05-01 22:29:47
shillberts gotta shill
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:16:02
Because customer services reps don't give a shit about procedures.
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:14:05
Yeah, and another security measure would be to utilize their vault which has a 3 day waiting period and requires authorization from 2 different email accounts along with 2fa if you've set it up.  
Coinbase should make a requirement for 2fa(not sms) for withdrawals over a certain amount(based on fiat value).   
Maybe they should also start issuing hardware tokens to users who don't want to use google authenticator or any other type of software token.  It seems like a cheap alternative than getting hit bad PR(unfairly imo) that likely comes with stories like this getting out. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:12:43
What's the issue?  This is how the free market works with current conditions.  And if you're a holder, it doesn't matter what the fees are.
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:13:39
it ain't happening for a few years.  bitfinex, tether, bitmex, and the asian wash trading has been a stain that needs to be cleaned.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:15:29
I thought they had security setup so that you can't initiate a btc transfer from a new device for 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:36:42
3.5 million, using his business as a cover according to this article: 
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:36:17
This will be all fixed with segwit and the LN.  In about 20 years!  LOL
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:07:56
Bitcoin is working exactly as designed.  The free market works.  Bitcoin is egold, not a payment rail.  We all should just get used to it.
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:14:36
will be fun in a few years when it's worth 10k.
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:11:07
oh, so everyone is losing in this market.  yawn.
