BCH is a fork of BTC.
It is a part of the bitcoin community. It is used by the part of the community who wants bitcoin to scale by blocksize increase (at least in the short term).

All bitcoin forks are bitcoin.
Bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, bitcoin (whatever name the 10+ other currently existing forks call themselves) and any future forks of bitcoin (or its forks)  are bitcoin.
Calling any bitcoin different things than what it is calling "themselves" is quite childish. This goes for any name such as bitcoin core, bitcoin segwit, bcash. 
Instead of engaging in childish namecalling-games, **educate people that basically anyone can create a bitcoin-fork. This is a good thing.** This means if something bad happens to any variant of bitcoin, it can be forked by the community and then the community will decide by using and trading the variants of bitcoin which of them should be used. A fork that adds 0 value and offers no utility to any part of the bitcoin community will be worth 0$ and will see no use. The bitcoin that is worth the most and sees the most use is the "default" bitcoin.
If you want to refer to BTC specifically you should just use BTC or bitcoin (BTC) or bitcoin. 
However it is possible that this changes in the future.
Whichever coin has the most use should assumed to be meant when only saying "bitcoin" and it is clear from the context that not all of the bitcoins are being refered to. Currently this would be BTC.

I you were living in Venezuela right now, which crypto would you use for 1. storing money and 2. transactions?
Assume your monthly wage is about 5$, like many venezuelans.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:26:08
There is much value in the discussion of what BTC is right now and how it could be better. It is the "talk about the tech" you reference in the OP...
On the other hand:
What is the value of your multiple-per-day market-post along the lines of  "we should buy more btc"? Holy fuck if you want to pump BTC at least do it somewhere where not already everyone has btc.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:21:52


So according to many people in this thread the monthly wage for many, many people in Venezuela is something between 4.5-5.5$. Do you think they care about the "largest most valuable coin network"? Or "the most name recognition"? They care about something that works for them, I would assume BCH and IOTA, due to low fees.
BTC is useless to *those people*, in its current state. This is inarguable. If you disagree I do not think there is any value in even debating the topic with you.
Maybe BTC will be useful again as a currency, but in its current iteration it is useless to most people, outside of being a store of value/ speculative asset with some potential for improvement in the tech. This may change in the future, I am an agnostic on that topic. If it does, great. I wish BTC all the best, but if it fails, that is not the end of the world either. I believe cryptos will succeed for underlying reasons. if BTC is not the one, another will.


That is not quite true. ETH is doing way better with more than twice the transactions with a 23 Gwei (30- something cent)  fee resulting in your transaction being done under 5 min in 99% of cases ( and BCH has the ability to deal with about 5x the max of BTC in its current iteration, though that network is not even close to its limit. 
Maybe if you think of size in logarithmic terms you have more of an argument but that is quite a stretch.
About steam: them stopping (hopefully temporarily) to accept BTC was due to the BTC network not working cheap and fast enough. Them choosing not to accept any other crypto is them deciding that it is not worth the hassle. 
Reading that post, I think you misunderstand what I meant to say a bit. I think some of that is my fault for not defining what I meant with utility, maybe this longer post made my position a bit more clear. 
I started using BTC some time in 2015, back then it was fast and cheap. It is neither of those anymore. Look at this chart:  . You cant drink tea and tell me "this is fine, everything is fine". It is not, the house is burning.

@_date: 2017-12-14 06:41:39
Ah, thank you for clarifying your position.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:26:25


 I am not hostile towards bitcoin, pointing out what others do better should not be construed as an "attack" on bitcoin. I would call it constructive criticism and pointing out facts, such as *current* uselessness for *certain* situations (like being peer-to-peer electronic cash, which it currently just isnt).
However I think we do not disagree that much in the end.
Lets go with that "under construction" analogy, it is quite a bit better than mine, which was purely based on the dog in the burning house meme. 
I used to live in the house for 2 years and it was fine. Then a bunch of new people moved in, and the house was too small and in general a huge mess with people all the time getting in each others way, and rent went up 5000%. Then I moved to another, bigger house with a lot more space, which is now more like the first house used to be, also a lot cheaper to live there. 
The first house is currently being renovated and built bigger, and hey, depending how it turns out I might move back in. Also owning a fraction of that house has lead to nice gains in value due to projected use of that house in the future, so that is great. Still, certainly not the place I want to live in right now.
But I really believe that there is going to be a demand for houses in the future, since it is preferable to living in the street, so I think house-technology will only get more popular in the future. Will that old house be the best house to live in once renovations progres further? Will it be the best house to invest in as a store of value? We shall see. 


While I agree on growing pains in general, what situation was as bad as the current fee and waittime-situation (I mean mt gox, but that was not really a bitcoin-tech-problem)?


100% agree that security and decentralization must be priorities before scaling. Scaleability can always be improved by simply sacrificing security and decentralization. We must not go in that direction, at least with not with decentralized cryptos.
I am fine with having a less decentralized and less secure coin where you never have more than like 20-300$ if you get very high speed and almost 0 fees. 
Example: I use my bankcard for buying stuff, it is instant, low/no fees. Quite secure, but 100% centralized, and, well, fiat ( with all that comes with that). Just to show an example from one end of the spectrum. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:42:58

I only see the worldviews of some people who were to some degree involved in the creation of bitcoin. Yet nothing of bitcoin's  worldview.
You can say "x% of bitcoins creator hold belief y" or "x% of people who use btc hold belief y". 
You cannot say "bitcoin's worldview is y". 
You may think this is semantics, but I consider the difference very significant.

I would recomend to be a bit more mindful of the benefits or variance reduction. Putting all your money in BTC might not be the best idea if losing x% of it would be particularly damaging to you.

Well, the context I was talking about was:
1. Venezuela where most people make about 5$ a month
2. The situation how it is right now. (so it is irrelevant if the issue is being resolved in the future)
I do not think it is "biased" at all to "hate" on BTC for its network problems in that context, it obviously has almost no use-case as a paymentsystem for small or medium size payments.
Also, calling BCH bcash is quite childish, but whatever.

It does not matter what the USDOJ and random newssites call it, it was not a ponzi.
what a ponzi is: 
what FTP was: a pokersite that used among its real income money from player-accounts to run its business/ advertise/ whatever. It was a business that made 10s of millions of $ a year and offered a service. 
It does not fit the definition of a ponzi. There are certain similarities to a ponzi, but there are an infinite amount of things that have certain similarities to this or that category, but are in fact not in that category.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:57:02
On the one hand this is great for cryptocurrencies, on the other hand BTC in Venezuela will be replaced very fast with ETH/LTC/BCH/whatever unless the fee-situation gets inproved very fast.
Name recognition is not a big enough advantage if there are countless other products which do the same thing for a fraction of the cost, especially in a country like Venezuela 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:40:10
I mean, sure he was promoting BCH over BTC, but lets be real, current BTC fees are absolutely not competitive or acceptable. This was his main talking point. His conclusion ("BCH will replace BTC") is an entirely different discussion, but if the fees stay like this, then *something* is going to replace BTC.
If this does not get better, BTC will be reduced to being a speculative asset, instead of something that is actually useful for a user.
These fees make me have 0 interest in using btc:
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:45:53
1.hurts your credibility a bit when you get basic numbers wrong that can be looked up within 30 seconds.
2.you make it sound that it is either "We only scale by increasing the blocksize" or "We only scale by off-chain solutions". 
An observation: the exact arguments you make could be made if the blocksize was  0.1 MB. "well why should we go to 0.8 MB, it will not result in being able to scale to visa-size."

Agree to disagree I guess. But it is not the end of the world, there are many alternatives for now.

Regardless, even if that was true, if someone is making EDIT: ~~20$~~ 4.5-5.5$  minimum wage a month right now, per sources /edit I think they are not too happy with 1$ transaction fee.
