If you could find exporters who are willing to accept bitcoin, they will probably find a buyer quickly online.   Even within this sub.   People would form group buys to help make it happen.  A show of solidarity.   A different narrative.   Greeks have the capacity to create value,  let's let them.

Really well made.  Interesting focus on mining.   Usually that scares people off but they made it front and center. 
More interestingly,  they say bitcoin has low transaction fees.  
That is what the expectation has always been.  At one point it was even assumed that a zero fee transaction would eventually get confirmed.  
miners are not properly incentivized to burden this storage and verification aspect of handling transactions.  They are richly compensated for securing.

I think you are seeking decentralization of the hardware infrastructure.  Others want decentralization of main chain access.  This is the essence of the debate, and why both sides feel they are fighting the good decentralization fight.

Nearly every response is saying it's wrong.  This sub should be abandoned.  Bitcoin.com forums are a good choice (though they have not clarified their moderation rules enough)

He makes a strong argument.  Why havn't they been more active/ better at communicating their activities on this subject?   Any sort of signal that they are indeed working on a compromise would be nice.  Their silence is evidence of Mike's perspective.
Those who supported XT have not gone away.   XT/Bip 101/any block size increase is not dead.   Supporters just took a step back once they got attacked and compromise was put on the table.
