Say, the installer has the error. What will happen if I install it?

It's regulated by maths and logic in the software.

So, that's because people didn't know what Bitcoin was, I see. They obviously didn't know the difference between really owning the Bitcoins by using their own Addresses and just storing their coins on exchanges. It's the exchange (MT Gox) who screwed them over, not Bitcoin. But they didn't understand that so they panicked....

What is a paper wallet and air gapped computer?

What about people using two 16-sided dice? They had to use TWO 16-sided dice because of 'binary'? Can't they just use one 32-sided die?
Is the private key just generated through a formula/function using those random values from the die/dice as seed?

I think Econimists and Finance dudes predict Bitcoin wrongly, because they don't understand how Bitcoin works, becauae they don't know programming.
I wonder if they're even aware that Bitcoin is limited and how secure it is.

How can I make sure the software that I use to generate Private &amp; Public Keys doesn't have malicious code (if I don't know how to read code)?
As far as I know, this is one of the procedures for safe practice:
1. Use opensource and download it. 
2. Copy paste it into a Notepad.
3. Put it into a clean USB stick.
 
4. Use another computer which has never been connected to the internet and will never be. Investigate the code. Then compile it into a usable application (exe file?).
5. Genetate Private &amp; Public key using that application on that computer. 
6. Write down the Private &amp; Private Key on a paper / engrave it on a plastic board or a metal slip.
7. Save it in a safe.
What else?
Thank you for your reply. Any information is much valued.

No, sir. Bigbluebawls genuinely wants to learn.

What's with Mt Gox?

Does anybody know what caused this? Probably due to Fundamental reasons?

I was going to use it but my country is not supported. Anything else which is also safe and convenient?

Is that "256-bit number" made of numbers from 0 to 9?
If so, is that called Decimal Key?
Wouldn't I need to convert that said Decimal Key into Wallet Importable Key format?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:42:38
Come on. :(

I checked out the video from your link.
He created a series of random 256 "0's and 1's", by tossing a coin 256 times.
He puts that 256 "0's and 1's" into a software and the software generates Decimal Key and Hexa Decimal Key.
The software again generates the "real" Private Key by using that Hexa Decimal Key.
What is the use of Decimal Key and Hexa Decimal Key? The software could have just immediately generated the "real" Private Keys instead of showing us the Decimal Key and Hexadecimal Key.  Why does the software bother showing us the Decimal Key and Hexadecimal Key?
Also, I found that the Decimal Key is just made up of numbers from 0 to 9.
Can I generate the Decimal Key like I described in my post, without using any software?

How about cashing it out and buy real gold?
