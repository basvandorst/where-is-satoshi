You could’ve said that off the bat. First comment changed who “we are talking about.”

You’re definitely entitled to take an unorthodox unpopular interpretation of Satoshi’s vision of what bitcoin is but at some point you need to let the majority dictate the name. Bitcoin is the $10,000 version and you must understand how confusing it would be to change that now. If bcash is better it will succeed but it has to accept a unique name.  doesn’t even use the phrase “bitcoin cash” and uses the real bitcoin symbol. So it’s misleading and you know it.

It’s GNU Linux. Richard Stallman made a brave Ver like effort to prevent that name shortening. You should be ashamed of yourself.

Some of your conclusions I agree with, such as demand for bch is probably about 1/10th that of btc and maybe more like 1/20 because of the known large holders of bch. Some of your other conclusions like people who don’t want it will all sell it immediately or as soon as the exchange allows it I don’t agree with. Some people who own bch I know that don’t want it haven’t sold yet and one person I know who dumped all of it waited and did it when he made the decision. Let’s simplify things. You agree some of the bch volume is fork driven right? It has to be the case for bch and cant be for doge. That’s pretty much the extent of my point. If bch volume is going down for some other reason like low fees on btc killing interest that’s probably even worse for bch.

It always seemed to operate like an RSS feed. Doesn’t seem to have expressed an opinion on the block size. Was just posting the price when the 1 MB debate was in full swing. Probably just someone who registered the name thinking they could make money off it some how.

Ok I jumped to a conclusion. Sorry about that. I stand by the fact that people moving around and selling coins they didn’t want or expect to receive is probably why bcash used to have more transactions than dogecoin. Some people would have gotten them in cold storage they didn’t plan to touch and had to move it a few times to reach an exchange etc.

As far as the name is concerned it should be over. Imagine if bcash came to be worth around the same amount as bitcoin while still refusing to have a different name? It will cause massive harm. Just use your own name and symbol. Maybe some day bcash with the green symbol will be worth more, anything is possible, but at this point it needs a unique name.

The BCH transactions were higher, but how much of that was people selling it who never wanted it in the first place?

You know you paint this picture of someone not wanting to give up their beloved account. Scroll through the old posts. It did nothing but post the price and now suddenly it only promotes bcash. We have no idea who the account is but it’s badly named. It has as much credibility as just some random person grabbing coca-cola.com. Im not saying it’s a scam but it certainly creates confusion that will make scams easier. It’s a bad actor.

This is a fair point. If the  twitter account did nothing but trash bitcoin and promote doge people would hate dogecoin.
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:27:45
I clearly stated that bcash could be worth more.!some day. You see how Bitpay isn’t trying to confuse people by not doing exactly what the  account is doing? so don’t try to pretend you aren’t out to contradict yourself somehow.

He bought on MtGox allegedly.

It can’t be proven or disproven. I just think it’s logical that a big portion of the transaction volume was people moving it around out of storage and onto exchanges etc. I think that’s what most volume is on bitcoin too. For the most part the market currently treats these as digital gold. But relative to something like doge bch had extra volume from people who didn’t want it moving it. Obviously some people bought bch at that time and a minority of people would have been moving and selling btc. It’s not really a rhetorical device that means anything. BCH has lower transactions than doge either way.

Not sure how anything you’ve written makes your point but at least you downvoted me so good job.
@_date: 2018-03-13 08:18:21
I’d never heard that. I was kidding because everyone uses the shortened term Linux but GNU is legitimately a large part of the code in Linux isn’t it? Surprised you’re hating on Stallman.
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:37:06
What’s your basis for that consideration? You don’t think people said oh wow look how high bcash is getting I better sell it now?
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:39:49
Among people I know it’s taken a while. Some people still haven’t dumped it. Either they don’t have much of an opinion on it and keep it as a hedge, wait and see, it haven’t gotten around to selling it out of whatever storage method they are using.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:30:16
I would be very surprised if the Trustee with so many coins already is out there buying more, or is trying to manipulate the market.
