Check out Changelly, and they have an API as well (from the makers of Minergate). They even have a websocket API as well for real-time conversion updates.

Laser is better. Thermal paper/ink rubs off and is destroyed with moisture.
Additional comment: this type of device would be great for creating bitcoin vouchers for store installations, bitcoin atms, etc.

Hey bud I hate to hear when things like that happen. This might be a tiddy a solution for you but go checkout Bitgo.

You need to convert your to string to hex and you can add it to OP_RETURN when you create your transaction. You want to put a unique identifier before your actual string so that your back-end software can sniff each block for transactions with your unique OP_RETURN.
AKA MyCompany;;HEXSTRING
Edit 1: Go check out bitcore and look at their different guides: 
@_date: 2016-08-21 15:40:56
Im not sure about their tech stack but Counterparty.io is prepping to go test then live with the ethereum evm and solidity port.
This will allow the community to write contracts, dapps, etc on the bitcoin blockchain through Counterparty.

All of his concerns on regidity of allow changes for a blockchain to be utilized on different industries is a farce. Just forke a previous chain or deploy a brand new one with something like Multichain.

Also, if you are on a metered connection, you may want to install some sort of bandwidth monitor.

Yes, if you open your ports and become a full node you benefit the network. Simple as that.

Better question: how many more KW/h would be utilized by miners for that increased block size. I do not think blocks that large would ever happen due to the economics of mining.
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:55:23
The graph is most definitely interesting. We all know Bitcoin is the king right now in the cryptocurrency space but it, most likely, will not remain in the future. Just as normal products have competition and are beat-out the same could potentially happen.
Bitcoin is the grandfather in a sense, with all other coins being derivative in some fashion. It would be ignorant to not think another future platform might replace Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:09:13
First and foremost we would need to estimate the amount KW/h an individual miner users to hash one block. I am not personally sure about what that number is, can anyone in the community comment?
I did manage to find the follow resource:  that provides an estimated energy index for Bitcoin. Note that it is in TW/h, above KW/h.
I am not sure about the scaling, but would it be safe to assume a 32x increase in power consumption?
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:19:14
Thanks for the response. How can you come to that conclusion though? How long does it take to solve the current block size with its current difficulty? Would the time not increase due to the increased amount of data to hash? If it does increase the time to completion that means more power is being used for that additional segment of time.
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:53:38
It WILL confirm at some point, don't listen to those naysayers misguiding and saying not. The network does prioritize higher transaction fee users yes, but it does not "dump" lower prices tx fees. It will eventually get lumped in with higher tx fees surrounding it if that helps as an analogy.
The guess is timing.
@_date: 2016-06-21 22:31:31
Best thing i can think of is transferring your bits to something like Coinbase. Then convert to USD and send it to your bank. Then to paypal. Man this lrocess looks ugly haha.
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:59:07
LOL this post is completely idoitic. The whole point of Bitcoin was to be a electronic peer to peer pay system. Why would you tell people to stop using Bitcoin the way it was intended to be used? Bitcoin will absolutely fucking flounder if people do not use it in day to day purchases, buying games on Steam, a coffee at the corner shop, etc.
Why not just say all transactions that are not investment related are banned? Idiotic fud.
Edit: if bitcoin  cannot live up to its promise to power this ideal, then guess what? A fork/change is needed! Fill the blocks, use it as a normal fiat replacement if you like. Do not let it become a mechanism only usable by traders that do not care about the ideals of bitcoin, just their pocket books.
@_date: 2017-01-03 18:57:56
Great, thanks for sharing. Per app load is per install or per opening of the app?
Also, curious as to why you chose Admob over iAds or whatever Apple calls it.
@_date: 2017-01-20 04:17:03
You need to download the actual Ledger Bitcoin Wallet app from the Chrome Web Store.
@_date: 2017-01-11 13:54:21
It is because they are a regulatedexchange, Know Your Customer (KYC) rules, etc.
@_date: 2017-01-03 18:36:57
Mind sharing some figures on your Admob revenues? I think it could be encouraging to other devs wanting to tinker.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:01:47
These damn Coinbase posts are starting to get really annoying. Does anyone even try to find solutions to their issues anymore without crying for help?

Maybe you should also post this in [Just saying.

It means that the Bitcoin Wallet Service that your Copay is configured to use is having issues. Contact their support or run your own BWS server if you are worried. Once synched you will be able to send.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:55:40
What you want would be better served via Counterparty (runs on Bitcoin blockchain), and Authparty.io
Authparty will create a verified account based on their wallet address. This will give you the ability to verify the amount of "credits" they hold.
@_date: 2016-11-27 17:12:26
Qr-code support exists on Android via Freewallet. Still waiting on Apple to approve the new update.

Author of the project here... Keen to gain some feedback!
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:26:32
It differs in the aspect that we are trying to create a ecosystem of web services that remove the standard username/password scheme and offload that to Authparty allowing for Single sign on and much more. We are also working on token controlled access to enable content restriction to addresses with certain assets held (TCA is powered by counterparty assets). We allow this with very easy implementation for the provider and seamless for the end user.
Also working on a idea I call Persona: multiple addresses held in the master address to create the representation of multiple users.
@_date: 2016-12-13 18:40:22
Stripe has a very easy to integrate solution for you that any developer can easily create. I think Braintree does as well.
@_date: 2016-12-15 13:44:04
Sounds like s BWS - Bitcoin Wallet Service would be a likely candidate for operators of a Bitcoin ATM network.

Thanks for the great response. I can use the Nano S to conduct U2F authentication?
@_date: 2016-12-15 15:14:48
It is considered an investment gain technically. I am not for it, but just being informative. Let us all agree that the current regulations in the U.S. are loose to non-existent.
I am all for paying my fair share of taxes, no issues with that. If the IRS wants to treat Bitcoin as a security though, I will just write-off my loses from the Stock Market to cover my Bitcoin gains.

But his argument is that he can steal your coins just by knowing the phone number of that device. I think that is a gross simplification.

2. Copay is wonderful but relies on a Bitcore Wallet Service from Bitpay.
3. Trezor, they also support U2F, the future of hardware-based auth.

Thanks for the nice words! A test version is live and linked to from the top of that page "Test Drive". Links to Github are also available.
The QR codes that are shown do work but only in one wallet, so far, and the update has not been pushed to the App Store yet. Manual sign is best for now for most people.
@_date: 2016-12-13 18:42:27
Not sure what the optimal tx fee was at the time of your transaction but I suspect that is the issue. Anytime tx's are slow to confirm it is usually one of two things:
1. You chose or allowed a low tx fee to occur
2. Lots of tx's backed up in the mempool
In the case of both you are fine and just need to wait it out.
@_date: 2016-12-13 18:51:11
I have a specific use-case of needing one address for the purpose of using Counterparty-created digital tokens. I am uninterested in having separate addresses for holding different CP-related tokens.
For this use-case what do you recommend.

Congrats! Now do not just sit on them like the rest of the speculators and go out into the wild and use them! Steam accepts Bitcoin through Bitpay :).
Sure, hold some in reserve as an investment, but Bitcoin needs a living economy to grow more.

Realize that crypto currency only references a digital asset protected by cryptography. It is not a "catch-all" that every cryptocurrency must be decentralized.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:45:49
I live next to St. Louis, MO, and still have few places to spend locally. My last few actual purchases (not spends for development purposes) were games on Steam.

Only if the company used their chipsets, which we would need them to disclose to us.
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:27:36
It is actually a logical step forward for a nation to move it's official fiat currency to an official electronic currency. This has nothing to do with "bad for crypto" or any other junk people are spouting.
It is not meant to compete with decentralized systems like Bitcoin. It is meant to replace their INTERNAL fiat system.
I would imagine that bringing such a system online would greatly enable the average Russian with easier banking, better access, and easier transactions.
The down fall with ANY government-backed electronic currency: full transparency. Auditors will be able to see who has how much wealth, and where it is moving.
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:58:06
They are still around but Counterparty is by far the most-used platform for such features. OMNI exists as well.

I agree with your sentiments. I agree that his example a is a simple way of describing Bitcoin though. We just need to stop getting hung up on replacing the entire monetary system, I doubt it will ever happen. I am betting more on micro transaction systems.

The same thing happened to me on Steam. My first three Bitcoin purchases went super smooth when the network was not congested. The fourth did not confirm in time and they would not refund the Bitcoin amount. They just credited my account. NOT THE SAME.

I totally agree with your inject and agree this is basic supply and demand. The fact of the matter is people are band-waggoning without really knowing a lot about the platform. This means those same people are a higher risk to sell off their purchase due to misunderstandings, issues with software, etc.

There is very little happening in BTC to justify this price increase IMHO. Community is still in grid lock. Major features sorely needed blocked/dragged out for implementation. The miner mafia. Price spikes, just like stocks, usually accompany good news.
The only great news I am aware of is Japan. That is not enough to justify this price increase. I think a correction is inbound soon.
P.S. I hold Bitcoin, just thinking critically.

Without any fee's seems disingenuous considering transaction fee's.... If you are not actually making a transaction and just tallying Bitcoin total in-network in a database, that is not secure. Congrats on shipping a project, just wanted to tell users some potential issues.
Plus, their funds could be stolen at any time since you have the keys :P.

How would you differentiate yourself from say Steemit, or Yours, etc.?
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:24:06
I am a developer working with the platform. My in-development service, Authparty, may be of interest to you. It enables you to securely login a user with their wallet and confirms which assets that wallet contains. If it contains the required asset for the album, you could allow them to download, play, etc.
EDIT 1: Counterparty assets are traded on the Bitcoin blockchain.
