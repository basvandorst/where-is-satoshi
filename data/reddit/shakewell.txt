Yeah, no problem. It's definitely an exciting development if true, I'm just not getting my hopes up quite yet. But thanks for the effort you're putting in.

Then post the "ongoing dialogue"... 
Nothing you have posted so far is anything more than corporate-speak that offer no real substance. There is a massive difference between "incorporating into Google Wallet" and "incorporating into our plans". Hell, if I said "Paypal is working on figuring out how to integrate Bitcoin into their plans", I would not be wrong.

Sure it is, you were saying it's basic econ 101 that by lowering supply miners can profit more by gonzo's logic. I'm pointing out that it's a bit more complicated and lowering supply drastically has other implications, so you can't disprove his original point since there are other variables at play.

More like 11.4%, as the 1% for each successive month is taken from a poorer you, having only 99% left from the month before.

demand would go down, nobody's going to use a shitcoin that allows 1 transaction per block

Yeah, I submitted a ticket with btc-e support, waiting to hear back from them.
I always get an email from btc-e that says "Successful authorization" and the ip address of where I'm logging in from whenever I log in, but I never got anything like that from them when this attack happened, or anything before, when the attacker could supposedly have changed the email address.
And yeah, I always use two factor security whenever available but too bad that wasn't an option here. :(

Good idea, just tried it, I do get a confirmation email from btc-e.com when I tried to change my email just now. 
Which makes this whole thing seems all the more weird and fishy...

I imagine it's something like a lot of people who already know a good deal about bitcoin want them to do an ep on it, "What's Levitt and Dubner's take on Bitcoin?", etc. I think they want to avoid talking about bitcoin just because bitcoin advocates want them to, but rather see if the general public who don't really know what bitcoins are would be interested in their take. 
I think they also want to know if there are more interesting questions they can address instead of repeating a lot of what other media outlets and "analysts" have already said on the subject.
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:08:39
Just checked, no suspicious activity at all. So the attacker didn't go through my email... Seems to me this puts more blame on btc-e's end...
@_date: 2013-05-31 16:24:32
hmmm wouldn't this happen to more people? and for more BTCs?
@_date: 2013-06-10 12:55:27
uh... that's if you already controlled &gt;2 GH/s of the existing 4... If you want to 51% attack a network, you'll need to match and exceed what's already there. So if a network has 4, you'll need to come up with your own 4GH/s+ to attack it.

Good call, but not too much left to withdraw anymore anyway, never really trusted btc-e in the first place so I didn't actually have that many coins on it to begin with.

What's are the best ways to exchange bitcoins into cold hard cash (USD)? 
With best being either:
*  Fastest
or 
* Cheapest

Primary email is gmail but for this btc-e account I used an old crappy yahoo email, lol. 
I'm going through yahoo's process for recovering deleted emails right now,  wonder if anything will turn up.
