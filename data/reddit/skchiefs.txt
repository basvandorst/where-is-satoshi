Or to bring some level of rationale to a bubble?

The big traders made bank shorting GBTC.

Then when you opened your wallets it would gap much much lower.

I think any seasoned investor would realize how far bitcoin has gone up and, more importantly, how quickly it did that. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:08:36
it'll stop at 15, 12, 10, 7!  
who knows
just keep in mind how far it has come
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:32:42
...is that it's still up a ridiculous amount
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:51:42
lol bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:18:49
It's really not.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:18:54
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:57:34
It's not a crash until below 3000ish
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:47:13
uh huh
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:46:33
shows 3 exchanges, 2 (bitfinex, bitstamp) at ~15.50 and 1 @ 16.8 (coinbase)
is there really that much of a spread / difference or is this site a bit behind?

he really shouldn't invest in bitcoin
you shouldn't be annoyingly trying to convince him
sometimes it's better to miss it than risk money
look at the long term charts, each looks more unsustainable than the last, and yet it keeps going.  At some point it won't, maybe a lot higher from here though -- how do you know?
Unless you tell him to put in some play money...  It isn't really investing, imo.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:07:44
the same reason how did they all rally so dramatically...  and could do so again
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:12:41
Best site to watch?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:29:28
You also have actual volunteers overseeing how the money is spent and distributed.  They are very involved and want to see their project succeed. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:00:58
That's what I would be doing.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:18:12
Wow, wish I were you.  If you want to throw $1M my way, that'd be great, but perhaps even better would be the various projects found at 
The value / dollar is huge.  Highly recommend looking through some.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:31:15
Not in bitcoin ;)
But maybe it goes to $100k and I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:17:18
It remains to be seen which cryptos will survive this crash and pull through
if any
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:00:05
"digital gold" being bitcoin?
it already went through the roof
and well beyond that
