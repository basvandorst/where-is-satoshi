No, absolutely I agree. But I guess when we start wondering if our revolutionary magic internet money is easier to exchange on usb sticks, then maybe it's time to ask what's gone wrong. Currently, I'm mulling over whether if I should risk leaving mine on an exchange or try my luck getting it to and from my own wallet, not to mention the cost of doing so. But I guess you know this feeling!

Okay, I get his definition of what “fiat” (not necessarily money) is, but I don’t see how this makes BCH fiat money. Can someone explain?

You’re welcome. I did the verification for both some time ago, but I remember completing it in the evening and it being done by the time I woke up. 
The only thing you should be careful of is that in general Aus prices seem to be higher than overseas exchanges. So you lose out on the buy side and win on the sell. It’s not normally that bad, but the last week has seen 10-20% higher prices across all coins! It’s insane, but not easy to avoid. 
My guess is that this is normally equalized by arbitrage, but with the back log in transactions, it’s not so efficient right now. 
Good luck!

This conversation has been incredibly helpful, but I’m not sure that’s 100% accurate. My understanding is that for a LN node to pass along a transaction it must have an opening balance equal-to or greater than that transaction amount. Not only does this mean that the more connections between nodes decreases the likelihood that the transaction can be sent, but there is also going to be clear advantages to hubs that have huge balances. None of this matters for micro transactions, but it you want to buy a TV or whatever and avoid blockchain fees, it might be significant. But correct me if I’m wrong!
@_date: 2018-09-26 02:04:53

It’s not so much the wallet then but the purchase. For small amounts, mobile wallets are fine. And to be honest, Coinbase vault is really quite safe. If you’re buying more than the cost of a ledger or Trezor, then it’s time to look into hardware wallets. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:42:39
We've got to be careful though, because (unless I'm wrong) the GDAX and coinbase example, or the "tab" just brings us back to the "trusted third party" problem, which Bitcoin was invented to solve in the first place. But I agree that this wasn't being proposed as a solution. The simple truth is that for now there is no solution. And he probably would have done better to just be upfront about it.

I've been trying to find an answer on this, do you know if Revolut lets you withdraw and deposit crypto to/from your own ETH/BTC/LTC wallets?
@_date: 2018-09-11 14:02:10
Yes, it is straightforward to retrieve if you have the private key. A friend of mine did exactly this a few months back. All you need to do is generate a BCH wallet using the HD derivation path that was used to generate the BTC style address. Then you can send it back to your original BCH wallet. However, given that this is BCH and not BTC we’re talking about retrieving, you’re probably better to post in one of the BCH subreddits, or PM me and I’ll step you through it. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-09-11 14:11:16
Roger was wrong to appeal to authority there, but asking whether Jimmy had actually read the theory he was citing was definitely called for. Especially given his whole “fiat” and “Keynesian” argument is utter nonsense. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:35:35
Dude. The trading speed on an exchange (off-chain) is totally different to transaction speed (on-chain). It’s the transaction speed everyone is worried about. If I was to send my bitcoin to you, then currently it would take a while and cost a bit in fees due to the current tx backlog.

I posted in the other thread on this. I get his definition of “fiat”, but how does any of that make BCH “fiat money”? Sounds like a dog whistle to me. IMO, there are much better arguments he could have made against BCH if he wanted to.

I couldn't disagree with this analysis any more. Charlie's point only stands if you *completely redefine* what "peer-to-peer" has meant in Bitcoin for the last decade. We all know that Satoshi called it "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". So, what did he mean by "peer-to-peer"? Well, the first clue is in the opening line of the abstract for the whitepaper:


"Peer-to-peer" then, describes the ability to transfer  value over the internet without using financial institutions like banks or PayPal as intermediaries. With Bitcoin, we can simply and easily send value between two transacting parties. Later on in the whitepaper, Satoshi elaborates:


So, it's clear. "Peer-to-peer" means the transfer of value between two willing parties *without a trusted third party*. With Bitcoin, there is no need for an intermediary trusted by both parties, because we *know* that the transaction is secure due to cryptographic proof. 
So far so good. We have ascertained that when Satoshi calls Bitcoin a "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", he is talking about payments being peer-to-peer. Transactions are made between two willing parties, two addresses, and nobody else is involved as an intermediary.
So what about Charlie's claim that Bitcoin transactions are actually "broadcast" to the network, or that they are "sent from sender to miners"? The first, minor point to make is that the signed transaction can actually be broadcast by the receiver. Indeed, this is what happens with Bitpay's BIP70 payment protocol. But the more important point is that we ought to distinguish the peer-to-peer nature of Bitcoin transactions just described from the way in which the network and the blockchain timestamps transactions in order to prevent double spending. 
Satoshi proposed digital signatures as a means of avoiding trust, but he notes that "the main benefits \[of digital signatures\] are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending". Hence, Satoshi's proposes  the proof-of-work blockchain as a distributed time-stamp server for time-stamping each transaction:


Obviously, the blockchain is a *shared,* publicly available ledger of all transactions. Under Satoshi's design, the blockchain is necessary to solve the double-spending problem, which has haunted all previous attempts at creating electronic cash. However, the fact your transaction is written on this public ledger—in other words, that you had to "broadcast" your transaction to the network—doesn't mean that your transaction is not still peer-to-peer. When you use Bitcoin, you're still transacting value online without a trusted third-party. You're still sending value from one address to another without a financial intermediary who needs to be trusted by both the sender and the receiver. Hence, Charlie is simply *wrong* to claim that Bitcoin and the blockchain ***isn't*** "peer-to-peer". To do so suggests a failure to understand how and why the Bitcoin protocol is designed as it is.

Agree. But I also think we should think twice before assuming that we know better than Satoshi, simply because we have 10 years more experience. As you said, he was clearly a brilliant mind. I find that the more I read of his, the more I’m humbled, and think that he was basically correct about everything fundamental.

There are places in the world, like North Queensland in Australia, where merchants are adopting crypto like crazy. Apparently some are even going crypto only. But instead of trying to encourage and merchant adoption, clowns like Song have we given up.

If the problem is block propagation and the great firewall of China, then removing the reward for empty blocks will only incentivize mining centralization. It’s not clear what the cause is here, but many of these empty blocks are closely following prior blocks. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 08:16:12


Greg’s reply seemed to give it some credence. But anyway, your point is well taken—Twitter clowns like Song don’t speak for you or for Bitcoin. That pleases me; I wish more would make it explicit. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 18:51:38
All I'm saying is that the obvious cause of empty blocks is that the miner is mining on the blockheader because they haven't yet received the previous block. This is especially a problem for Chinese miners who struggle more than most to receive blocks because of the disruptions caused by the great firewall of China. All of this is why empty blocks tend to be blocks that just happen to be found very soon after the previous block. 
Now, it does look like some of these empty Antpool blocks were found later than one would normally expect. But this doesn't mean there's not an honest explanation: mempool trouble etc.
Also, we shouldn't forget that even empty blocks extend the chain, securing all prior transactions with more proof-of-work.

There’s absolutely no reason why any of this shouldn’t be extended to vendor payments, or really all transactions.

Of course. What I meant was that in exchanging private keys instead of sending a transaction, the recipient must *trust* the sender to destroy their copy. Otherwise those coins can always be spent at a later date. This is precisely the kind of trust that Bitcoin makes unnecessary.

It's all explained [here]( The "Network Cost" fee is how Bitpay pass on the mining cost of consolidating the UTXO for fiat conversion. Effectively there are two transactions: (1) you sending to Bitpay, (2) Bitpay consolidating for fiat conversion. Both are based on the current mining fee and both have to be accounted for. As another user said, Bitpay would make a loss if they didn't pass on the cost of mining fees.
So, I stand by what I said. If you want to use the Bitcoin blockchain for payments then you have to be prepared to pay the network fees.

In an alternate dystopian 2018, Paul Solotoshi, freshly released from US custody, decides to return to his cartel roots to finish what he started. But Solotoshi’s family is murdered when he is usurped, what’s more he’s incapable of stopping it. 
In this alternate timeline, a technology called “the looper” exists to transport items 10 years back in time. The cartel use it to get rid of people. Nobody is looking for a body before the person in question is missing. Filled with rage and regret, Solotoshi decides to use the looper to loop back in time to prevent their deaths from ever happening.  
But he also decides to take back the source code and whitepaper for a cryptocurrency called Megabit Coin by a pseudonymous inventor who goes by the name The Ol’ Nakamoto. 
Returning to 2008, Solotoshi passes it off as his own invention with the plan to enrich himself beyond all imagination. He adopts the pseudonym, Nakamoto, but uses his own name Solotoshi (minus the Ol’). Satoshi Nakamoto, aged 46 (in 2019) is born. 
I think it’s almost as believable as the garbage article.

If you want to use the Bitcoin blockchain for payments then you have to be prepared to pay the network fee. There's no such thing as a free lunch. If you don't want to pay the fee then use Lightning (admittedly not offered here), a cheaper altcoin, or pay with fiat.

@_date: 2018-04-11 22:44:02
It’s more about figuring out how to do payments within certain constraints. If you change these constraints then payments are not a real problem. Plenty of alts are claiming to do them well, either by changing the way transactions are validated or by increasing blocksize. 
The problem is, how do you allow payments without making the node requirements too great. If we think it’s important for all users to run a full node, then this problem needs to be solved. Hence the current development plan. But we should be under no illusions that this problem is shared by competing cryptos with different values. 
@_date: 2019-05-25 00:34:08
I think there's an interesting question buried somewhere in here about the extent to which we expect honest miners to defend the integrity of the blockchain. The point can be made clearer with an analogy—we can discuss afterwards, if necessary, whether the analogy speaks to the attempted appropriation of funds and consequent re-org.
Consider a hypothetical scenario in which a vulnerability is discovered in Bitcoin that allows miners to either appropriate funds from unwitting users. If a miner exploits the vulnerability before it can be patched, then how would we expect honest miners to respond? Should honest miners accept all valid blocks and continue mining on top of the longest chain, regardless of whether or not these valid blocks contain the exploit? Should honest miners recognise that the exploit undermines the integrity of the network and orphan any block in which the vulnerability is exploited? Or finally, perhaps we think that miners orphaning exploit-blocks undermines the chain *more* than the exploit itself? The question is: what should honest miners do, and what do we expect them to do?
Since Bitcoin introduced the Segwit soft-fork, Bitcoin Cash has faced the problem of what to do with coins that are accidentally sent to segwit addresses on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Bitcoin Cash developers introduced a new address format precisely to circumvent this problem, but use of the Bitcoin-style address format still persists in some wallets and services, so the mistake of sending Bitcoin Cash to a segwit address remains possible.
Some large miners have historically allowed users to recover these coins by approaching them directly. Segwit addresses are "anyone can spend" on Bitcoin Cash, because of the lack of segwit, so for a small fee some miners would construct a non-standard transaction to recover these funds for users and mine it in their next block. But the introduction of the "clean stack" rule in the [November 2018 hardfork]( to fix malleability (the same as [Bitcoin BIP 62]( rule 6) inadvertently made these segwit addresses irrecoverable. After community concern about these now lost coins, this was fixed in the May 2019 hardfork and these addresses could once again be recovered with the help of a miner. However, these "anyone can spend" addresses were exploited by an unknown miner immediately following the May 2019 fork.
This lead to the dilemma: should the majority of miners orphan this valid but underhanded block, or should they accept it and extend the chain? I think this dilemma is comparable to the hypothetical I sketched out above, and some miners decided that the right thing to do was to orphan the block in question (at this point it was buried under 1 further confirmation) and send these UTxOs to addresses where only their rightful owners could recover them. As it turned out, these miners were supported by majority hashrate.
Now, perhaps this was the wrong course of action, and perhaps it did undermine the integrity of the network *more* than allowing these addresses to be exploited. Miners were protecting these coins for their rightful owners, but this norm is obviously not included in the consensus protocol. And if miners can be expected to voluntarily enforce *this* non-consensus norm, then what *other* non-consensus norms (legal or political) may they be expected to enforce in the future? So, maybe this event did set a bad precedent, but I don't think it's *obviously* true that it did. I think there's a good case to be made that the majority of the Bitcoin Cash hashrate did precisely what they are economically incentivised to do, and protected the integrity of the network. Regardless, of whether they were right or wrong, I certainly don't think this was an example of a 51% attack.
@_date: 2019-05-25 06:21:27
It was orphaning two blocks, and probably only just the 1 at the time the two mining pools decided to invalidate the block that stole the segwit address funds. As we all know, Nakamoto Consensus approaches majority consensus over time. It’s only with sufficient depth that we can be certain that the ledger is the product of majority network hash.
@_date: 2019-05-26 02:02:00
Lol. You’re the one who said:


I simply inquired as to what these other available options for solving the Steam problem were, because bip70–which ensures that payees provide the correct payment amount and a reasonable fee—seemed like the obvious solution. 
I tend to think that if you’re going to FUD bip70 and argue that there were better solutions to the Steam problem available, then you should at least be able to sketch out what said solution could be.
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:20:03
BIP70 is hugely important because it ensures that users set the right fee to have their transaction confirmed in the next two or so blocks. We saw exactly what happened when transaction volume was high and BIP70 wasn't implemented: users sent payments that didn't confirm for long periods of time, during which volatility affected the value of the BTC transferred, and merchants were forced to either refund the payment  or request additional funds, both incurring new mining fees. This is precisely the situation described by [Steam when they decided to drop Bitcoin payments via Bitpay]( BIP70 would have avoided this situation.
Also, BIP70 has been out for, what, two years now? Wallets have had more than enough time to implement the protocol. You can hardly blame Bitpay if they haven't.
@_date: 2019-05-26 07:30:22
I don’t think that describes the situation at all, sorry. I stand by my description above.
@_date: 2019-05-25 22:26:48
So how do you solve the Steam problem? Bitpay went with bip70. What’s your alternative solution?

I'm sure there were other options, but I can't really think of any. What do you have in mind?
@_date: 2019-05-25 03:02:10
I’m sorry, I’m not sure I follow…
@_date: 2019-05-24 00:19:41
If you want to prevent the situation that caused Steam to drop Bitcoin then using payment protocol is hugely important. At least that's what Bitpay decided, and I'm inclined to agree with them. Refusing to understand why BIP70 became necessary and FUDing it because wallets haven't been able to implement a rather straightforward protocol in the space of 2 years is just absurd.
