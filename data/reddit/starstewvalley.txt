Hey dude, what's up! I just want to congratulate you on getting that sweet, sweet Reddit Gold. I can't believe it! Man, I wish I got Reddit Gold! How is Reddit premium going? 1 whole week without ads, man! Thats, like, 7 days! Dude, I grew up on a farm, and Reddit Gold was my only wish! I had a dream where this genie came up to me and I wished for 3 REDDIT GOLDS! It wasn't real (yet.) Aw, you're so lucky! You get 100 coins, too, right? That means 7 golds and you get enough coins for a gold! Man. I can't believe that people valued your post so much that they spent real life money on gilding your post! I wish MY post got gilded. You see, I used to have a friend called Jimmy. He, too, wished for Reddit Gold. Back in Kentucky, he once did that river rocks thing to get gold! It actually worked! Sadly, after that, he fell on his head. RIP Jimmy.  I cant BELIEVE it, man! Never in my WILDEST DREAMS would I ever expect me to see a gilded post! I'm so jealous! By the way, if you could give me Reddit Silver, that would be amazing! So close to Reddit Gold! Do you like Reddit? My favorite subreddit is r/HaveWeMet. What's yours? I bet it's this one because you got gilded on it! That's like getting 10 Victory Royales in a row! I hate ads, dude. One time, my teacher told me to AD 1 and 15, and I said "Nah dude. Screw off with your mathematician gig." and I got expelled! Because I couldn't AD 1 and 15! Man, after this, my dad put me up for a "doption" or something. GG dude.
