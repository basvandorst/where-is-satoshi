The price dropped because there is no resolution in sight for Bitcoin's transaction backlog problem.  As long as this state of affairs persists people will continue to move their money to alternatives.
And this didn't just start to happen a few hours ago.  Bitcoin has been consistently losing market cap percent for a couple months now.

Ripple just dropped like, a billion in cap in only 30 minutes, good lord.

The community is in shambles.  No matter where you go, talk of bitcoin is full of anxiety, hate, vitriol and gnashing of teeth.
if I woke up tomorrow morning and bitcoin had lost 90% of it's value, I'd first be shocked and horrified, and then I'd realize that I can join another community that works together, has dreams of an amazing future in crypto and is always improving... I'd let out a sigh of enormous relief and just be happy that the nightmare was over.

Yes, market cap is just determined by price, and price fluctuations are not 1:1 in capital inflow, more like 100:1 or 1000:1, so If the market cap goes up by a billion I would guess that the actual capital inflow to be less than 10M, maybe as low as 1M, these ratios fluctuate a lot.  
For example, just go to poloniex and look at the market depth for BTC/USDT.  Based on Bitcoin supply, you would expect that raising the price of Bitcoin by $1 would constitute a capital inflow of $16.3M.  But, if you look at the order books, you would only need $1.2M to raise the price to $2000, which is only about $5000 of capital to raise the price of Bitcoin by $1.  That's a 3000:1 ratio of market cap to actual capital inflow.
