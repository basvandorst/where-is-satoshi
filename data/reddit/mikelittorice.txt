The "centralization" shit again? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:12:07
Then better start using a paper wallet because apparently you do trust Ledger by using their wallet and software ;) 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:15:14
I think so, yes. Competition will be fierce though so fees can't be too high probably.

It was posted on btc and then here with the intent to troll, look it up in the other sub. Someone suggested to post it minus the sarcastic title just to be annoying. In this thread every response that even remotely looks like someone believes it's real got upvoted many times while people who say it is fake got downvoted.

I once dreamt that I woke up and saw the Bitcoin price dropping to zero. Waking up after that and seeing the actual price was a good start of my day :) 
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:27:54
Maybe this will reduce the "I need a dip because I want to buy more" posts that always annoy me. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:06:44
And how would one differentiate a series of unrelated single transactions from one that could have been batched? Don't talk about tech if you don't understand it please, this will confuse people and that's how we ended up with Bcash. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:30:59

@_date: 2018-01-07 21:06:12
Maybe someone with a lot at stake is trying to keep it from dropping because of all the dumping...

How do "rich get the best network"? And how does one "manipulate payment channels"? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:44:04
You clearly don't understand how any of how this works... Nobody is paying Bob to open a channel, you open a channel to Bob through the blockchain. Do your research and come back when you understand the basics because right now this discussion is useless. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:33:40
Best thing about this joke is they upvote anyone who bought it and downvote anyone who doesn't so it looks like they really accomplished something. Anyone seeing a link to the pumping of a certain coin?

Make sure when you set it up for the first time the device itself gives you a series of words, that's your seed. If the seed comes from anywhere else reset the device to factory settings and you will get the seed from the device itself. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:23:18
Maybe you should learn how to spell Lightning first. Then learn about software development, and that there needs to be constant improvement for it to make sure it can keep up with growing adoption.

You got downvoted but I think this is a valid question. Building new features on an environment that's already in use is always kind of a risk I think, but with good development protocols it's always better than doing nothing and falling behind.

Where can you look at people's faces while they type Reddit comments? I'd like to see that :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:55:55
The first spike is exactly when the price dipped in November, this was exactly when reddit, Twitter and other social media channels were flooded with Bcash messages and the mempool suddenly filled up. It really looks like the same thing is happening again... 
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:11:15
I'm just worried about the complexity standing in the way of adoption. I mean, btc has lots ways (api's, libraries, code examples, tutorials) to be used without hassle by developers and for monero this seems a bit hard. Is this true or are there relatively easy ways for devs to set something up (like an app or website) and start receiving monero?
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:40:39
"Y" is the sound they make when their TA fails and they loose a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:30:08
Correct, if you would be the one doing this you can easily predict the top and the bottom and trade accordingly and thus make a ton of profit. What worries me is that someone with bad intentions and lots of coins can keep doing this until the end and only get richer in the process...
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:45:18
Well played... Very well played... 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:39:37
Yeah, you're right. Buying bitcoin last year was batshit stupid. Missed the boat entirely or panic sold too early? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:21:57
What monopoly? Everyone who wants to can create an exchange with Lightning support?
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:10:16
That's what people would say when it was worth less than a dollar. And look at where we are now.
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:01:47
All in with what you can afford to lose?
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:36:55
Even better would have been to buy some coins a few years ago. 
@_date: 2019-07-21 22:20:58
Does anybody know how Monero works? I followed the process of a Ledger wallet implementation and this was really bad (people lost money in this process, lots of money) due to the ever changing protocol and complexity of it. Took ages and I actually stopped following it and sold what I had because of it.
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:53:16
Are you asking for more downvotes or a pat on the back?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:06:54
I think Lightning's success fully depends on good (for users preferably invisible) implementation in payment apps. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:56:20
How does that work? Where I'm from crypto counts as capital so it's taxed just the same cashed out as in crypto? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:24:54
Regular users won't have to know, but I want to :) Test version of Lightning is ready, are there known exchanges who have started implementation yet? Maybe we need to start pushing them to implement Lightning instead of Segwit (they need to implement segwit for lightning anyway so that would be a double win!) 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:49:42
Improvement is already here in the form of Segwit, it just needs adoption from exchanges, and the Lightning network is worked on as we speak. I agree the fees are way to high right now but I trust this will be fixed in the near future. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:22:53
You clearly don't know how the Lightning Network works...

@_date: 2017-12-28 15:28:01
The 1 dollar price was for a second appealing to me too, but then I remembered half of the coins that can ever be mined belong to a single company and there was a relation to Mt Gox and then I bought some Monero instead. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:13:37
If you need to ask, yes, that's more than enough for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:09:52
How do you explain the spikes? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:08:38
I have watched the mempool over the past years every now and then, but never in a graph over time before. That was a real eye opener, thanks :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:37:13
You sound like you are in the middle of a discussion, yet you are not. I'm so confused! 
@_date: 2019-07-13 13:22:04

@_date: 2017-12-27 10:10:59

@_date: 2017-12-27 19:06:02
The level of stupidity in your comment is unbelievable, do you really think Bitcoin will recover when it drops under 1000? Just buy now and trust it will go a lot higher or stay out of it.

Over 280k actually, hopefully spammers are done for a while. As long as the mempool keeps clearing up I fully trust Bitcoin to bounce back in time. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:07:28
If I set the view to 30 days I just see the same peculiar spikes? Sure it's increasing, but that is not the point.

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:24:56
I don't deny there aren't problems. But everyone who follows this subreddit for longer than a day can see the sudden change of tone. Coincidentally at the same time the fees spike and the price drops. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:37:28
Just start by reading through this subreddit and watch some video's or find articles about stuff you come across and don't understand. I learned a lot this way! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:28:27
Just wait until either the spam attack is done (and all pending transactions are handled) or a proper scaling solution is in place. Fees will drop when the mempool clears up, it should be a matter of time... 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:04:19
How about more paying customers? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:09:57
Segwit is already part of Bitcoin, the fork you are talking about seems to be a scam so I'd stay far away from it.

I see enough reasons posted here to say this is a bad decision. How much of a ux loss is one extra tap on the currency to switch between them? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:03:20
By implementing Lightning they can make money from fees and offer all their users lower fees immediately. Implementing Segwit would help to lower fees eventually but not as much as lightning and there is no direct profit for Coinbase in it so I could understand this decision. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:54:22

@_date: 2017-12-19 20:36:51
Wow, never seen it in a graph like this, those spikes don't look natural... They seem to come out of nothing, and coincidentally exactly at the same time lots of negative news about bitcoin and positive "news" about Bcash comes from everywhere... 
@_date: 2018-09-01 16:29:08
Sst, he'll turn into one of those 10k never again trolls if this goes too high so soon!
@_date: 2018-09-01 08:20:34
Much wow! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:23:35
Personally I have been following this sub for over a year and just didn't have the urge to be part of discussions until hell broke loose. I do suspect lots of accounts to be created to spread FUD about bitcoin and pretend Bcash is the holy savior though. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:03:00
So much bullshit, if you could predict this then you would be hugging your screen all day getting filthy rich. You are nothing but talk. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:23:03
Can you repeat the question? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:45:26
I don't understand what you mean? The first payments on the main net have been made and different implementations are created as we speak. What is not working? Or is my sarcasm detector malfunctioning? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:55:14
It will all depends on the scaling/fee problem, if it's solved within the next year Bitcoin will probably forever remain leader. If not, who knows what will happen... 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:19:36
It was, they were not as high as they are now but the problem was absolutely there and fees dropped a lot immediately after the attack. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 05:54:16
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:57:36
Bitcoin is the only one under a massive attack, no other coin can handle that right now just the same as no website could handle a DDOS attack 10 years ago (and most still can be taken down today). If another coin would take over it would face the same problems, and those are addressed now and will hopefully fixed soon. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 17:12:17
Yes, people sold some Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:10:20
Maybe... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:22:49
Roger Ver thinks he does... 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:20:42
I think the explanation is clear for people with their eyes open, just look at the facts and draw your own conclusions. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:59:40
Check bitcoinsvergelijken.nl, not sure which is still selling. Have good experience with bitonic and bitmymoney but the latter can't send directly to a wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:01:34
Just came across this graph 
The first spike is exactly when the price dipped in November, the mempool suddenly filled up, positive messages about Bcash suddenly appeared everywhere on social media and bitcoin was being trashed by previously inactive accounts. Looks like the same thing is happening again... 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:33:07
Bitcoin has a 10 year head start, everybody already knows it  so what will happen if people can use Bitcoin in the next year with virtually no fees on every major exchange and stores start accepting it? Most alt coins would be obsolete. But that's iffing and butting indeed. Like I said: we'll see in 2018. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:32:02
Depends, some early adopters might have millions worth of coins. Better be safe than sorry in that case! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:57:59
You created an account especially to say this? Wow, sad... 
@_date: 2019-07-22 20:17:44
Were where you in January?
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:31:50
Well, it kind of crashed so this should be a good time to buy! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:51:06
Ethereum is the only serious one I would consider, but I don't think it will be able to handle the number of transactions Bitcoin handles right now. What's your opinion about the Lightning Network? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:59:12
Spamming the mempool costs lots of money... But the high fees are also scaring away the actual users so that "helps"... 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:46:51
The link is right there in the post... 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:41:14
Gee, I wonder why your total karma is negative... 
@_date: 2018-09-01 15:49:01
I got tipped on that sub "to post on cash.memo" (don't ask me why or what I told the generous giver) so I wouldn't be surprised someone is giving away shitcoin money to stress test as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:18:32
Compare it to paying a fine with small change, would you consider this spam or regular use of a currency? 
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:57:13
I'm still calling you an idiot. And smug on top of that, feel better now?
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:55:58
Care to explain why? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:39:12
Yeah, just like email and the internet didn't get adopted because it was slow.... 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:26:17
What point are you trying to make? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:58:14
Not knowing how something new works has nothing to do with stupidity. I think lots of new users don't even know fees can be adjusted, and if they do they probably haven't got a clue how many "satoshis per byte" they should use. Wallets should help them with this. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:38:02
Just wait, it will either go through eventually or go back to your wallet within 14 days. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:07:15
The chance is exactly 50%, either it does or it doesn't. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 10:02:20
No it shows it in my native currency, Bitcoin is nobody's native currency yet so now everybody has to do math every time they use the wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:09:11
I think if exchanges and/or wallets start using Lightning and you'd buy coins via such an exchange/wallet they can open the channels for you so it won't cost you a penny. Not sure though so if someone could confirm this? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:37:32
He's talking about the subreddit, Bcashes subreddit is called but that's not confusing at all ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:43:02
Ok, which one is capable of scaling to the size of Bitcoin without problems? I think Bitcoin is all about focusing on the tech, and it has the best solution to actually solve the scaling issue. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:25:26
Mycelium is trustworthy but no segwit yet, they say they are working on it though. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:16:59
Sure, but you never know. I don't even trust one backup for my own coins... 
@_date: 2018-09-03 15:10:15
Always! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:31:09
Have you tried to contact Coinbase support? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:45:05
You probably have more success with this post in @_date: 2017-12-20 06:49:45
Yes, you agree to a certain price with an exchange and that doesn't change anymore after you payed. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:47:51
Why don't you contact their support instead of asking here? Say many people here asking about stuff they should be asking the business that can easily answer their questions... 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:30:46
No we are not, but we are definitely not cool with using a coin controlled by criminals. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:33:40
But that would mean you don't pay taxes as long as you don't sell? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:06:47
You can always keep using it, and I think it always will for large transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:51:42
Thanks, will do that! For micro payments it would be fine as you describe it, it would take a lot of load off the main chain and thus result in cheaper transactions as well in case you need to move from a cold storage wallet for example. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:08:56
Congrats on your second comment, I see lots of progress! Keep up the good work :) 
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:13:13

@_date: 2019-07-17 09:02:34
When was I wrong? I'm not saying what the price will do since nobody knows for sure.

Hindsight is always 20/20!
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:22:02
Sorry I missed the point, but that is only because Ethereum did increase the block size right? I am pro increasing the block size for Bitcoin as well for now but I also think this won't scale in the long run. 100mb block sizes seem a bit steep, do you have a source for this? 
@_date: 2018-09-29 10:05:32
This! One thousand times this! 
@_date: 2018-09-01 16:45:35
Yeah, mee too. They're basically paying people to say what they want to hear. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:37:37
Care to elaborate? 
@_date: 2018-09-29 09:52:38
And pull it inside out! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:56:45
No taxes? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:03:01
Looks more like the people here asking about this fork are part of the campaign, never seen this many questions here about a fork with no potential. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:38:42
Don't invest anything you can't afford to lose is the only good advice I can give you, and do some research on the technology behind the coins you invest in and see if you have faith in the future of the coin. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 21:03:32
It starting to get a little funny, the fuzz here about nothing. The price basically didn't move for 3 months and still everyone freaks out over a little dip...
@_date: 2018-09-29 06:30:03
Can you draw lines in different colors? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:07:51
Look at his comment history (and look at mine) and remember who is spreading FUD...

I'm curious too, educate us!

I was with you until the sure thing part, that almost got me to blow my beer out of my nose :) 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:38:18

@_date: 2017-12-24 23:04:50
So, if one bank burns down they would never be able to access their coins anymore? I think this is only part of the security measures, they are smarter than that. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:19:05
Because Bitcoin has the name, how many people do you know who know Iota? There is a reason Bcash is trying to steal the name.

@_date: 2017-12-20 23:16:52
I actually think people who use the phrase "lol" in a discussion aren't capable of an intelligent discussion and not worth the time to talk to but to answer your question: No, at this time I would recommend people to wait a few days until this thing blows over and everything goes back to normal. The mempool will clear up just like last time, transactions will still not be cheap enough to buy a coffee until an actual scaling solution is in place but I'd rather have 10 dollar transactions and a good team of developers working on a solid scaling solution than some idiot who can't control himself cloning something what you call "unusably bad" and "fix" it by changing a variable that will cause even bigger scaling problems in the long run.

He should have stated Bitcoin doesn't have ONE website to refer to. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 15:50:40
Weird... Maybe it helps to add an extra underscore here and there?

Who says he didn't sell already? 
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:11:55
If you look even closer it's just one big puppet show. The problem is that not everybody looks as close as we do, I can imagine people coming there and believing their crap. This is all really bad for Bitcoin, the sooner this coin dies the better. I just hope Roger's exit scam won't take to long. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:56:54
@_date: 2018-08-30 06:19:53
Wtf? It's not a religion, it's the protocol that makes sure this will happen. No need to hope for anything. Please educate yourself and then reevaluate your opinion based on facts instead of a gut feeling.

Maybe that's a good thing, instead of people saying "I bought Bitcoin at 20.000 and it went down so much" we'll hear "I shorted Bitcoin and it is worth so much more now" 
@_date: 2018-08-04 09:42:10
There's nothing being "pumped", the price barely moves. Or do you really think "they" have something to do with 50 dollar price changes? 
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:56:08
Exactly what I was thinking :) 
@_date: 2018-08-16 10:23:58
Yes it would, but back then they probably still believed in their "flippening" and that ship is sinking hard right now.

@_date: 2018-05-25 20:12:35
You said Google trends shows a decrease in interest and it doesn't. That's not cherry picking, that's just stating facts. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:53:33
By being a good protocol. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:24:45
It is an easy way to get your Bcash and sell them for real bitcoins if you had bitcoins before the fork. Aside from that, this should be more of a feature somewhere else in the app.

You wanted to donate a few dollars but decided 50 cents was to much fee? Even though you will never have to pay that much for a donation since nobody cares if it arrives in 10 minutes or 10 days? Sure, cool story bro. Now go back to your own sub.

It *might be* better reviewed but it's never truly secure. Backdoors can also be in open sourced code and just not yet discovered.
@_date: 2019-11-18 17:25:49
Open source also means hackers can look for bugs and use them instead of fixing them. I'm not saying one is safer than the other, but you're just making assumptions.
@_date: 2019-11-19 06:24:31


All I'm doing? I wrote one comment? 


That's an assumption right there. 


So if I open source a project full of bugs today, that immediately becomes safer than it was yesterday?
Don't get me wrong, I'm all in favor of open source but you're not making sense.
@_date: 2019-11-15 08:44:56
Nah, they don't need anyone but themselves to get angry.
@_date: 2018-10-28 16:08:44
But you get nuts with your beer for free, so that's a win.

Regular cash. Still better than Bcash.

Much wow!
@_date: 2019-11-01 06:50:25
I removed this app when they added support for Bitcoin Cash while Segwit still wasn't supported even though they had been promising to add it for months.
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:27:17
I couldn't move my own money from my savings account to my regular account today because of a technical problem at the bank. As far as I'm concerned this is moving money from my back pocket to front pocket as well as economic activity. Also, with crypto this would never happen.

If they have a license to play music by John Williams they clearly have too much money... On the other hand I wouldn't mind waiting while listening to the jurassic park theme :)

That's not what I said or implied in any way.

At least not about the past.
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:25:19
I think the "you have to be online to receive a payment" is such a non argument, small payments are all about immediately knowing something has been payed for to finalize the transaction. With any payment method you'll have to be online with at least the payment provider to be absolutely sure of that. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:41:56
Also, free to use Lightning equipment to receive payments by small merchants would help. It's ridiculously expensive to have a payment terminal for small businesses. At least where I live. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 09:01:49
So paying with lightning would be a lot cheaper, that was exactly my point. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 10:57:48
Lots of people here have the memory of a goldfish, they tend to forget everything that happened more than 2 days ago... 
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:40:06
PayPal is overly expensive in sending money, bitcoin replaces PayPal already in cost and easy of use as far as I'm concerned.

You can buy it for her and send it an address she owns. A hardware wallet is always a good idea (especially for long time holding) but it would be kind of overkill to buy an 80 dollar wallet for 50 dollars worth of coins for example.

Automated sentiment can switch really fast. 
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:05:03
If they sell it after someone sold it to them by buying something via a vendor, that means 2 transactions opposed to 1 when they'd hold everything they receive. I don't think that's really a problem for the ecosystem.

Just what I was thinking, calling people an idiot never helped anyone to learn something.

Any people here who frequently comment on r / btc? I noticed the 10 minute delay (because of low karma there, obviously) was gone for a while but it's back again. I'm wondering if others noticed this too?

The only thing I've ever been tipped with was BCH and I'm not touching that crap with a ten feet pole if my life depended on it...
@_date: 2019-08-09 19:04:09
So what you are saying is that it could either go up or down or possibly even nothing will happen?
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:07:01
Reality, upvoted.
@_date: 2019-08-26 13:16:52
I think he's talking about the Twitter handle.
@_date: 2019-08-10 07:04:58
Although I agree with you about the safety issues, it's still better to use 2fa over sms than not using it at all.
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:45:27
Same as dollars, by just not being there. 
@_date: 2019-08-23 06:41:40
What is it with BCH supporters calling everybody "idiot", "dumb" or "imbecile"? Are you trying to convince others you are right or just yourself?
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:25:19
Don't give "advise" like this, nobody knows what's going to happen. It could go up by another 2000 dollars but it could just as easily drop that amount or more.
@_date: 2019-08-23 06:57:39
Yeah and then someone painted some scary shit all over the ugly thing!
@_date: 2019-08-03 16:41:38
I hope you have better totts.

I'm from the Netherlands, how much do they charge per transaction? 
@_date: 2019-10-31 20:12:41
It's a start!
@_date: 2019-10-29 17:10:33
What source would you accept for a confirmation of something like that?
@_date: 2019-08-16 14:53:21
Or buy more drugs :)
@_date: 2018-06-06 06:18:17
It could be enough, but for a small retailer with a few employees it probably isn't.

I know destroying it is illegal where I live, not sure about defacing it...

Says the 1 year and 8 month old redditor that should know about the possibility of having multiple accounts.
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:01:30
The more people own it, the harder it is to manipulate. Look at the 24 hour percentages every price drop. You'll see Bitcoin drops the least, my guess is that is because it's already more spread over lots of different people and it's more expensive to get a large enough amount of to manipulate the price more. It's takes time, but I fully trust it will become stable one day. 
@_date: 2019-08-21 06:18:51
Most likely anything but that...
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:48:22
Why? He says he has more so he doesn't sell it all.
@_date: 2019-08-26 15:34:20
1 and 2, yes. 3 is more likely they are broke from trying to push BCH than bored.
@_date: 2018-06-07 09:12:17
They think it's overly complicated and difficult to use. And it kind of is at the moment, just as the internet was difficult to use in the early days. With time and adoption it will become easier to use. 
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:00:00
Can confirm Open node has support for Lightning.
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:09:54
I saw a post earlier today, the monero app should be available in 2 days!

Be nice, no need for name calling.

I haven't bought in a while but there are sites dedicated to comparing prices from different exchanges. A quick Google search should do it.

You should ask Roger Ver, he's still trying to make his own Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-03 15:39:35
It helps me. It's entertaining and confirms my bias against the Bitcoin Cash community as this is their spokes person and thought leader.
@_date: 2018-06-15 07:31:47
Nothing is certain in crypto.

You call spreading lies and deliberately confusing people "good marketing"?

Pluto needs dogs.
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:03:18
This has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin whatsoever?

You made me laugh out loud, thanks :)

Are you calling me old for remembering this?
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:57:41
Yeah, sorry but I'm not going to watch another 5 minutes of some dude (you?) complaining about simple jobs not getting payed enough. There's a reason for that: they're simple, anyone can do them.
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:23:19
I just poked it with a stick and it moved a little so I guess it's OK. 
@_date: 2019-08-21 05:44:40
I sold one of my old cars to a friend once for about that amount, so not entirely impossible.
@_date: 2019-08-10 14:59:36
What bad advise is this? How can you tell if he can afford to invest this kind of money?
@_date: 2019-10-01 16:50:57
10 minutes.
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:38:33
I do. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 12:42:38
Because one of them is a scam. 
@_date: 2019-08-21 10:16:22
If you feel bad about the price not shooting up (yet), you should check out the mess in the sub that shall not be named:
- The  handle on Twitter is no longer in control of bcashers 
- Roger Vergina is no longer the CEO of bitoin.con for unknown reasons 
- shortly after previous news, the bitcoin.con website set btc as default buy option instead of Bcash (sadly only for a while but still an interesting move) 
- A bitcoin.con fundraiser completed last month and the money is kind of missing
So lots of uneasy people there, grab some popcorn and enjoy the shit show! No need to bring the salt, there's enough of it!
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:00:57
Probably bullshit, just another marketing stunt like last time.
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:36:14
Just don't give it attention, just like a spoiled child it will stop wining eventually. 
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:45:02
That, and you're only allowed to withdraw a certain amount a day. With bitcoin you can easily steal 10 million dollars in one go if you want (and have the right target).
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:32:49
Did I get immune for these down swings? Because I keep reading about "huge drops" and "blood in the streets" and all I can see is a huge rise over the last months...
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:30:06
Meanwhile, in the other sub they are doing their best to explain why Bitcoin is going up and their fake version of Bitcoin is not. Conspiracy theories all over the place. I'm thinking of selling tinfoil hats there, do you think this is a good business plan?
@_date: 2019-10-31 19:21:32
300 dollars spread on one day isn't enough for you?
@_date: 2019-06-01 21:03:15
What's your brilliant strategy then?
@_date: 2019-10-01 16:49:56
Thanks for the heads up, saved me a click.

10k sounds more reasonable than 5k so let's go there first and then see from there.

Install Bluewallet on your phone and tell me it's too difficult to use again.

I'm not the one complaining...
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:34:48
I use Bluewallet, easy to use and includes support for Lightning wallets.
@_date: 2019-02-12 11:53:56
Yeah that's going to last long... 
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:52:52
You really did post in the wrong sub to ask at first (r / btc)... The comments there are always the same, it's like they're waiting in the woodwork with standard comments until someone makes the mistake to ask something about Bitcoin there instead of here.
@_date: 2019-02-03 08:18:57
The protocol is designed to be trustless, people need to trust the protocol. 
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:47:18
Theoretically you could happen to buy the dip exactly every month. Or, you could just miss it every month and buy the ATH every time. Practically both situations will happen almost exactly the same number of times as long as you keep doing it long enough. That is what we call "averaging".

TIL; I'm not human...

Remember when Coinbase finally started batching? This was a huge relief for the mempool. If I remember correctly Coinbase was even for a large part responsible for the huge fee spike back then.

I love to see this shitcoin die, I'm even a frequent visitor of their sub and looking at the voting there I'm not the only one.

Well genius, why is it so obvious? Please enlighten us!

Yes, 10.

It's not hostile, it's just being precautious.

Start to end, nothing but Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:30:20
Maybe people will engage in a discussion with you more often if you'd change your tone to something a bit friendlier instead of this "you are all stupid and I know everything" attitude.
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:59:45
All of them.
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:19:33
The one we do not speak of. It tries to steal the Bitcoin name by vicious ways and keeps failing harder and harder. One day that sub will be reclaimed by the real Bitcoin and the alt coin that rhymes with Shitcoin Crash will be nothing more than a distant memory.

In comparison to r / btc that would be a welcome decrease. 
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:23:12
It's mostly a testicle festival here I guess.
@_date: 2019-06-16 13:30:54
No they won't. They bought because they wanted to make money, when they see it going up again they'll remember why they bought in the first place.
@_date: 2019-06-01 06:00:35
Worst case scenario would be - Ledger sits in a drawer for 2 years, an access bypass vulnerability in its software is found, Ledger gets stolen and all your funds get transferred to the thief. You restore your wallet from the seed only to find its empty now.

Always verify the address after scanning though!
@_date: 2019-12-21 09:44:01
Accepting a transaction marked as replaceable and then seeing it getting replaced is not double spending. It's a software bug handling the protocol wrong. Also, don't believe anything written on that site since it's clearly only there to promote Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:49:44
I have not heard from average Joe yet, only technical Theo mentioned Bitcoin was doing its thing again.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:48:20
I'm always entertained by their "reminder: xyz" posts, it's a weak attempt to make it appear there's some activity in the sub. Reminder: Bcash is not Bitcoin, spread the word!
@_date: 2019-02-07 10:17:53
Where do you get this from? Do not believe everything said on r / btc. Interest is just low at the moment I guess, check back when the price is going up again, it will be a lot busier for sure. 
@_date: 2019-12-01 09:39:54
6500 what?
@_date: 2019-02-02 06:38:29
Some more words: Bitcoin. Has. Utility.

Nothing is hard about it if you have half a brain. 
@_date: 2019-12-27 11:27:23
Anytime is good if you buy small amounts on a regular basis instead of tons at one. Look up what Dollar Cost Average means and decide for yourself.

I stopped reading after that part :)

Not sure, but it shouldn't be hard to find. Just avoid adding "bitcoin" to the search phrase and always check the address before sending any coins.

People downvoting this (honest) question: maybe answer the question instead of downvoting? What seems obvious to you can be confusing for others so educate instead of downvoting please.

Why do you want to use a computer?
@_date: 2019-06-01 21:06:44
Dude, be reasonable. You only want to use it so you can say you can't use lightning. Well, if you're stuck in the 90s with your computer, fine: Lightning is waaay to hard (for you) to use right now.

Meanwhile, in the sub that shall not be mentioned, there's apparently a tattoo artist accepting the fake bitcoin and looking forward to doing his first tattoo for that shit. Sadly, he keeps forgetting to tell people the name of the shop or where it is exactly. Maybe someone (besides me) can ask him? I had a good discussion with him the other day so he won't do a tattoo on me :(
Update: he agreed to do a Bitcoin Cash tattoo on my ass if I pay with BCH so I think we might become friends after all. Only problem is he doesn't like my promotional talk for him here. Such a shame, I was honestly trying to do him a favor...
@_date: 2019-04-03 19:53:49
Sorry, it's like I said: nobody knows.

Why would you invest in a coin that's has nu usage but does everything to pretend it does. BCH is run by criminals,, need more info?

There are lots of trustworthy exchanges where you can just buy some, no need to mine, sell coke or suck sick to get some!

That has nothing to do with security, it's about routing only being possible through nodes with enough funds I think.

Have my upvote instead to compensate. This downvote is just ridiculous.

How do those hurt the market of the very coin you are in the subreddit of? I don't approve of those either but at least those keep up morale and trust in the technology we all should be rooting for here. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:36:33
The absurd low price predictions based on nothing annoy me te most, it's just to spread fear and make people sell so other people can buy more for less. Most of the time it's new accounts and it's all so obvious if you know what to look for button, but for new people it looks like they are some kind of experts and they know what they are talking about.... 
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:59:41
Maybe both
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:51:18
So, one person told you that or did you read about people that have been told by one person? Bitcoin has and always should be a payment method. Lightning is an extra layer to provide a means of using it on a larger scale and with small payments without fees getting out of hand.

Your comment matches his to the letter except the money symbols are different. Might be a super big coincidence but somehow I doubt it. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:53:11
Then do a story that shows both sides, winners and losers. And please highlight the fact that people who lost everything were dumb enough to put money in something they clearly did not investigate enough since the volatility has been a known fact since the inception of bitcoin.

Sure they can but why would they crash a market they have so much money in? There's a reason the sell off until now wasn't done all at once.

If you buy one bag of chips today for 1 dollar, and buy one bag of chips for 50 cents tomorrow because it's on sale. Does it really matter which of the two bags you are going to sell for two dollars next week? And yes, you can buy as many times as you like, bitcoins as well as bags of chips.

If you're buying food at stores that sell chips that are close to their expiration date you should start looking for a different store. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:03:55
If you take the definition literally then nothing is a store of value. The value of gold fluctuates, would you call gold a store of value? 
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:51:47
Because your account (like many others) is relatively new and your history contains nothing interesting, just a lot of nonsense and low price predictions. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:28:07
Looking at your comment history you know nothing, why are you pretending you do? 
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:58:20
Or do both and use half of the coins for each option so you won't feel sorry when the price starts to rise again. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:49:41

This should have a guarantee to be right at least 80% of the time or get your money back policy, it might convince people with doubts (like me) to try it. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:39:00
They have lost nothing, the value of what they have has fluctuated but nothing is gone or is it? I explicitly mentioned it is volatile, you can't deny it is secure and it does its job at storing value. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:10:45

Bullshit, it's a working currency and (although volatile for now) it has proved itself to be a secure store of value. That's what gives it value. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:06:53
Not sure if it's just noobs panicking over a few dollars or a FUD campaign but every time I come here and read some comments it seems the price went down a few thousand although it hasn't actually changed since the last time I checked. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:53:01
If you'd zoom out that line is going to the moon. Why would the selected time frame be the one to go by?

You should learn how to use punctuation, people might actually be able to read your comments.

Spreading nonsense again? Care to tell why yet? Or what your idea is based on?

Nope, I even panic bought some more near the bottom.

Someone stated btc isn't useful now, and I said it is. That's what I am talking about. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 10:06:54
I see it too, it looks more like pre-2018 movement now. Let's hope it continues! 
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:07:05
The world is bigger than just uncle Sam my friend. Every time the market has been attempted to be destroyed, it's wasn't and instead got stronger and stronger. Also, some people have indeed been losing money but people will start earning money once the price starts climbing again. Crypto will, in a few years, be for everyone since adoption keeps growing and the technology keeps improving and has proved to work as a real currency (although still volatile but that will be less and less over time) . 
@_date: 2018-07-20 20:08:40
Those are all for me, I have something extra special for intruders :) 
@_date: 2018-07-12 05:10:54

@_date: 2018-07-17 18:22:09

@_date: 2019-09-06 23:52:22
That's a lot better, maybe even post for a while. That has always helped me in the past!
@_date: 2019-09-22 10:58:57
.. saying that I love Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:19:56
The public key would be useless to the robber, it's the private key he needs. Or the seed. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 13:12:50
Would you care about to explain what you mean when you say "a close"? Bitcoin markets never close as far as I know? 
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:01:12
No it's not.
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:34:36
I have some for sale for you for half that price!
@_date: 2018-07-06 06:49:15
It works more than fine for me, and their prices are competitive so stop wining about shilling when somebody just gets entousiastic when seeing bitcoin in the wild. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 17:21:17
It's not skyrocketing until it's over 20.000 in my opinion. But the reason for the price increase could be actual people who move their shitcoin money to the real thing after some positive news and positive TA indicators. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 21:43:09
If you battle for global adoption, don't start with 3th world countries. They will follow when 1st world countries, where the big money is, start the adoption.

Great! Now go learn how to make a screenshot instead of photographing your screen.
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:36:32
Yeah, that's an option. But the better option is to remember we can replace "weed" with any other kind of party enhancer that's illegal in the progressive state you live in and my point still stands.

Bitcoin for storage, Lightning for payments. Wow, the future is now! 
@_date: 2018-07-19 19:55:13
How many of you tried the Lightning Network? I just set up a wallet and had a spin on lightningspin.com to test it. It still has some bumps (usability of the wallet mainly) but it's so cool to use! 
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:24:39
I think you should never underestimate a robber when it comes to big money
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:59:06
Then why would you not just buy bitcoin only and save yourself the trouble of trading? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 15:28:09
Ok, then buy me this one? 
@_date: 2018-07-20 00:00:52
So getting free stickers isn't as big a risk as projected here, that's my point. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:53:38
What stone have you been under? People have been successfully shorting bitcoin for months now, isn't that what you'd call beneficial? And if you'd bought the dips and sold high like lots of people did, wouldn't that have been beneficial? 
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:18:37
Probably a man with different talents :) 
@_date: 2018-07-29 05:44:24

It should be way more, there's so much garbage out there. 
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:35:16
What bugs did you encounter while using it?
@_date: 2018-07-20 10:42:52
Sometimes I like to play a game: whenever I haven't checked the price in more than half a day or so, I come to this thread first and try to guess the price. I was only off by 2 dollars today! It's a shame I can't play more often since usually I check the price at least twice every 5 minutes... 
@_date: 2018-07-15 20:31:52
He said he shouldn't have got on the bandwagon with this nonsense or something. And since that got downvoted too, he deleted the comment. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 05:34:50

@_date: 2018-07-20 00:15:52

Now go buy more!

You forgot to mention the vicious dogs you rarely feed that are released in the yard every night. 
@_date: 2019-09-18 13:09:08
I don't think so, mostly gold is given to good comments that are just stating facts that don't fit their believes. The suggestions about shills is just another defense mechanism of these aluminum hat weirdos.
@_date: 2019-09-14 07:13:01
I noticed this too, both Forbes and Coindesk seem to do this. And with them lots of others but I disabled notifications for a lot of platforms like this in the past few years so I don't know their names anymore.

Never regret what you can't change, it's a useless emotion.

No no, it's slowly degrading in the opposite direction. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 17:25:37
If I would have a large amount I'd make sure to get a decoy wallet with an acceptable amount for me to loose and for a robber to leave my house. Also, owning bitcoin does not equal to owning lots of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 17:35:31
I removed Mycelium. They have been saying for over a year that they'll support segwit soon and instead they added support for Bcash a few months ago and promoted it in their app. Looks like they either had a donation or more likely its been bought by Bcash supporters.

For unwanted ventures all the way into my bedroom I have a special surprise in my nightstand. My wallet is also near the door, but mostly because I forget to take it with me if I put it anywhere else :)

No need for name calling, this only makes you look bad and your comment worthless.

I thinks he wants the link to the site where he can get the stickers :)

Please do and leave this sub, we will be happy to take your coins from you and even happier not listening to your wining anymore.

Ah, sometimes I feel like Sheldon over here. Sarcasm just flies by every now and then :)

That's a lot of pussy eating...

Sorry, that was my keyboard choosing the wrong option. I'm usually annoyed seeing that too :)

Nobody cares enough about Bcash to list it. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:00:03
Even more amusing is the jealousy of people when they realize those comments are from people who bought years ago. 
@_date: 2019-09-03 11:36:28
We had a 600 dollar drop and an 800 dollar rise within a week. What more do you want?
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:57:53
I have downvoted you. There's a reason you need to have some positive karma, and this is not the way to get it. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 14:24:46

Done. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 19:45:03
So, I ask you an honest question and you downvoted me? Or did someone else do that? 
@_date: 2018-03-16 19:22:12
You've got a point there, although the ridiculous high prices are mostly with a wink instead of some amateurs TA selling it as the absolute truth. 
@_date: 2019-09-04 06:11:02
Adoption! :)
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:58:01
I forgot I have to watch that show, thanks for the heads up :) 
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:12:31
5 comments and zero upvotes, seems trustworthy indeed. 
@_date: 2019-09-22 09:36:07
@_date: 2018-07-06 06:45:47
Probably even sounds about right when spoken out loud ��
@_date: 2018-07-21 09:02:10
I'm not against selling, I'm against people telling other people what to do like they have some kind of superior inside knowledge, and I'm absolutely sure don't know any more than the rest of us. Nobody knows what will happen next and you tell people it's absolutely sure there's a dump coming. 
@_date: 2019-09-08 17:32:12
Why not?

How do you know my profession? Have you been following my brothers or something...?
@_date: 2018-07-20 20:52:31
Downvoted for telling it like the its the absolute truth, nobody knows what's actual growth and what's artifical.

I'm thinking magpie.

Coke and whores? That wouldn't be for me, it should be something special and not just basic life needs. 
Just kidding, I decided to sell 1 coin once it's worth about a years salary so I can take a year off work and work on a project I'm not getting around to now. The rest is for my pension I guess. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 21:07:40
Something about the price movement being obvious and lots of frustration, not sure what it was exactly. I hate how you can just remove your entire comment or ninja edit it on this site. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:27:49
I'm sure we can, just think of all the companies, equipment and software that's used right now or not even out yet. Bitcoin is huge, it won't disappear just like that. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 08:48:30
What is he gonna do with that info? Send me more free stuff? 
@_date: 2018-07-06 16:18:30
That's true, but what I meant was that the ATH was almost a year ago. It's a shame to still have regrets about this today. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 05:14:25
Lots of it! 
@_date: 2018-07-29 08:40:21
Sell for stuff, in other words: use it to buy things. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 14:53:28
Oh, well at least I'm deciding it for me so there's that 
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:02:35
Also it's a lot easier to buy stuff with bitcoin instead of dragging a lump of gold and a knife around everywhere you go. As long as there is internet, my money is on Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:07:15
See top comment, that's her. So you're not, quite simple math.
@_date: 2018-07-01 21:51:37
I am fucking serious, what's the difference: 1. You need either a bank account and a PayPal account with ridiculous password requirements and confirmation of identification. Or 2. You need a bitcoin account and a lightning channel opened (click).

If I was a robber I would skip his house, sounds more like a spoiled teenager with a rich father to me. Would be sad for his father to have a brat like that and be robbed as well...

I know, that's why I thought he was screwing with me too. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:39:12
Looking at your comment history, my guess is you sold near the bottom didn't you? 
@_date: 2019-09-06 05:49:49
He does not say it's not backed by us dollars, he's saying that even if it wasn't it wouldn't matter. Now put your tin foil hat back on and go back to the sub you came from.
@_date: 2019-09-22 10:57:55
If you'd really think for one second: it's worth 3 times now what it was worth a few moths ago. You should ask yourself who's NOT making profit.

It's not if you never reuse the same address. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 17:17:52
If it's so obvious, you'd think you'd be making lots of money off it. Yet you sound really frustrated for some reason? Do you need a hug or something?

Yeah, I sleep on a mattress made of stacks of money. Oh, and some stickers to bind everything together ofcourse!

That's like saying Ferrari printed money by making cars. Bitcoin needs energy to be created, and fiat or other bitcoin to be bought.

Some of the best new technology comes from illegal activities, there's lots of money involved so it attracts creative people with good ideas and the skills to build it. It will take some time to come into the "real" world but it will get there, I have no doubt about that. The only question is how long it will take. 
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:09:25
Then why did she post pics of this earlier and you didn't?
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:30:38
No it's not, this is the internet where anyone can lie very easily. Except for you, you got caught immediately. If I were you I'd seek help, it's not healthy nor normal to do this kind of thing.
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:55:45
Well, better start buying then.

Who downvoted this? You asked, he answered. I dislike Bitcoin Cash as much as the next guy here but please be adults about it.
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:08:14
It doesn't store anything in your media until permission is given so yes, that is how it should work. Also, pro tip: if you want to be taken seriously, stop ending sentences with "lol". 
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:43:08
You were saying it is buggy and I'm asking you a very simple question you didn't answer: what bugs did you encounter? Also, he's not telling people to put ALL of their coins in the network, only spending money.

Reading this is better than comedy :)

Hence the aluminum foil addition ;) It's just an observation and I'm really curious if I'm seeing pink elephants fly or maybe others noticed it too :) 
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:26:06
He might be right, I don't trust this sudden spike at all... 
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:06:32
Hi Bob! 
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:45:15
It should be possible to keep the screenshot in memory until permission is given? 
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:14:11
Yeah, but I don't trust the sudden spike in combination with this observation. Maybe I'm just paranoid... 
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:58:18
They cared the last time it dropped 85%, I remember feeling bad for people who bought that high. ATH was 1200 dollars back then, would you buy for that old ATH right now if you could? 
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:16:33
And it's a pure coincidence they're all down with the exact same error of course? 
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:58:57
Not to be all aluminum foil hatty or anything, but has anybody else noticed a sudden increase in super positive comments from relatively new accounts? 
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:00:33
Thanks man, much appreciated! 
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:11:47
So she stole your costume to take pics and then brought it back so you could wear it to Dragon con? Believable story! Or do you have any proof that this ís you?

This story, although well written and informative, is worthless without the result of your research... 
@_date: 2019-09-06 06:35:02
Did you even listen to the interview? Because your questions have already been answered. My argument is that you are spreading lies for whatever reason, nothing more and nothing less.

Transaction time depends on the fee you pay and how many others are willing to pay more. How much fee did you pay? 
@_date: 2018-04-07 14:36:20
That would be the internet, which exists since 1981. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 13:26:45
I think you dropped this: /s

Nice one :) 
@_date: 2018-04-14 08:13:34
@_date: 2019-05-20 09:27:15
I understand, it seems this investment is not healthy for you. Maybe you should set a price alarm for you to break even and sell once you get there.
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:55:26
Another possibility is that the next time you send coins they get hijacked because of an unfixed vulnerability. No seed can save you from that.
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:47:48
And possibly three more months and it stops working at all. It's bad practice not updating devices like this.
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:59:28
Compare it with the first time people connected their computer to the internet VS now: 
Open the computer up, put a pci card into a free slot, close the computer, boot it up, install drivers, reboot, configure irq, baudrate and more stuff I luckily forgot, install browser software, setup the connection to the isp, reboot again, hope it works now and for God's sake nobody pick up the phone while you're connected.
Plugin modem, press a button, connect your phone or laptop to the wifi, done.

He's looking at some curly fries at the Mac Donald's, hoping his bull burger is ready soon. Or something. Sounds positive though, and Bitcoin seems to be going up again so another upvote on the houser from me!
@_date: 2019-05-19 12:24:52
I've read through your recent comments and it seems you're emotional about your recent investment. My advise is to try and forget about it for a few years or sell at a loss now if it's really that much of a mental problem for you now. Don't go on here and pretend you know anything cause clearly you don't.
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:40:00
That's bad advice as far as I'm concerned. If there's a critical update fixing an access bypass vulnerability in the device you're telling him not updating is fine? I know that's not the case right now but can you guarantee it's not in a year? Or in five years?
@_date: 2018-12-31 09:29:38
Useless comment is useless. Self your brace. 
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:56:02

Him? I always though Bitcoin was female since it's pretty unpredictable and she can be a real bitch. And I'm not even bringing up the occasional red turds.
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:23:06
Ludicrously large is what Bcash is doing: scaling for the sake of scaling without thinking of the long term consequences. The main consequence being an unmanageable large blockchain, way to big to store and even more problematic: syncing those huge blocks every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:54:26
Or at least for the next hour or so.

He's asking a hypothetical question, just give an answer or don't respond at all.
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:46:20
Yes, there is a problem. But anyone with an iq over 60 can see it isn't solved by ludicrously large blocks.
