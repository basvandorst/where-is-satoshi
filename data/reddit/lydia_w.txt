Yeah...this video actually made me feel a lot of pity for her, despite my disdain for her actions.

i upvoted in my hope that this was an intentional literary reference

Hmm. So did I, on silkroad sub somewhere. Once you mentioned it, I remembered running across it and looking at the transaction on blockchain.info. I have one transaction in my browser history that may have been what I saw:

Odd! Thanks for the heads up!

i don't mean to obsessively post in this thread or anything, but...coinbase is a legitimate company--and thus doesn't deliver lawsuits via reddit messages. how in the world can you make this story plausible?
@_date: 2013-10-04 03:13:20
but that's not the case, actually. if you click on the link of the title here, the youtube user's videos are all still up and working, except for this one. and this is the same user account that's been around since the first hour the story broke, so i'm pretty sure it's him. 
the one video that i've noticed being taken down but mirrored by others was the interview with his friend, which I think had actually been hosted by his friend, and since taken down by him.

well put

 ...there's also a 30 day wait after your first purchase to reach the 2nd verification level        
@_date: 2013-10-04 01:28:18
"An error occurred. Please try again later." ...wha?
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:31:56
oh my, that's true
@_date: 2013-10-03 06:04:12
i'm open to paranoia on anything related to this topic, but i'm struggling to imagine a motive for that
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:38:39
you know this is a fake, right?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:09:10
Hmm. I agree completely. 
...Bitticoin? 
...Bitcent?  
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:56:47
woah, any guess what's with the scrambling??
@_date: 2013-10-07 15:20:19
that was the address for the $26,000 bitcoins they seized. Presumably it was some sort of working overhead for silk road. that was not the address for his hypothetical personal fortune of 600k bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:50:49
coincidentally, i was just logged into coinbase and checked that. credit card verification instant buy still requires level 2 verification, which still requires the 30 days wait
@_date: 2013-10-03 06:07:45
...super weird!
@_date: 2013-10-07 15:40:58
oh, woah, i missed that. apologies! do you have a link?
@_date: 2013-11-17 08:20:55
So..could you give any more solid information here? All I see is ambiguity plus exactly one user repeatedly saying he's seen the details. 
An example of information: *Why* exactly is coinbase hypothetically suing you?
@_date: 2013-11-17 08:24:04
could you perhaps provide a 5-10 word summary of why you say they're suing you, that doesn't involve a screen share? for instance--what does your balance atm have to do with a lawsuit?
@_date: 2013-10-04 01:32:25
the thing that makes this engagingly weird to me is that all his other youtube videos (which, hilariously, the media has been referencing obliquely in character profiles left and right. yeah, businessinsider.com, i know where your paragraphs of insight came from...) are still functioning. i wish i had some data on whether this was actually functioning before news broke. do you know?
