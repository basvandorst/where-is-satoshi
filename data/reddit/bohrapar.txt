n00b here. I started with small amounts mid November. Made decent profit. Sold everything on 18th of December with 45% profit. I bought the “dip” at midnight on the 19th at around $17,000, because I though I was the shit! 
Fast forward to the 21st evening (South Africa time). It was my first correction. My feet were shaky, palms sweaty, knees so weak I could barely stand. So, sold everything when I reached breakeven. As the price tumbled again, I decided to buy again perhaps around $16,000. Then the price tumbled even more, so I sold again. Lost more money in the process. Then as the price crossed $15k (prices are estimated since I was buying in South African Rands), I bought again. I have not seen a cent of profit since then. 
On the bright side, I don’t feel pain anymore.  I can watch BTC crash and burn, I won’t nudge. I’m just going to HODL through the storm.

so, how many tokens will be dispensed to each user? What value will be the initial value per token?

I was in India recently and I used WazirX. Couldn’t buy BTC with INR, but could do so with USDT, and could trade USDT with INR. So I guess exchanges like Zebpay and WazirX could be relevant, kind of?

I use a local exchange, Luno. I scanned their QR code from the Luno app, entered the ZAR currency value, which the app converted to the equivalent bitcoin value and sent. It was a much quicker process than using a credit card

Yes.

Can’t remember the name, it’s a small shop run by a French guy, on the first floor of Cape Quarter  mall in Greenpoint. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 07:22:12
Not sure what that is (Im a crypto noob). I just keep my btc on an exchange - Luno. Its fairly secure, easy to transact with as well

Fair enough. I guess I got sucked into my statement to support convenience. I guess I was trying to say, I personally found it surprisingly quick, compared to my experience of using credit cards.

It’s in Cape Quarter mall in Greenpoint. I wouldn’t know about Joburg. I’m yet to discover more places around Cape Town that do accept.

Thanks, I’m a crypto noob and had been hodling since the crash. I thought I might as well put it to good use now. I realized that hodling is defeating the whole point of bitcoin.

The fire is on signal hill now, visible from my apartment, but I think we’re all safe, for now.

I’m growing tired of just sitting on it. I’m not a serious investor in crypto. I tried trading it and failed miserably, and have been hodling since then. I will probably continue hodling 80% of it, but I’m keen to use it, make transactions, send money to relatives etc.

Sunglasses retainers. It was just a trial purchase. Ive just never seen a shop accepting bitcoin in Cape Town before, so got excited. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 19:35:03
Thank you. I think I’ve finally got over the losses from the crash (which weren’t really significant in monetary terms) and this is me moving on.

I have to pull out my wallet, open the flap, pull the credit card out, swipe it, choose between straight or budget, enter my pin and hit the big green button. 
With bitcoin, I opened the app, scanned the QR code, entered the amount and sent

Yes, I learnt to stop worrying and love the technology! 
@_date: 2019-01-27 18:36:40
I felt awesome!
