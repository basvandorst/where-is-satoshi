Ha! Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:38:55
The fee's vary and depend on where you are transferring from.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:02:42
The one I mentioned in the original post, Ledger Nano S, is what I recommend but there are other options as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:51:42
I always hate to hear stories like this. I feel for you!
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:52:13
If the device gets lost or stolen as long as you have your seed you can restore the funds and as long as you have a pin on the device it is protected from prying eyes. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:09:57
What exchange do you use? The fee's can vary greatly depending on the services used for the transaction. I will also add, that fee's become minimal on larger transactions. The reason your fee seemed so high is because you were at the floor of the fee levels and they couldn't go lower.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:04:44
You connect the LNS to your computer and use the Ledger Wallet app  to enter the GDAX address and click send. It is very easy. Here is the official guide: 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:15:36
Haha I wish I worked in the cryptocurrency space because those companies are making bank right now. But sadly I don't. Just a normal IT dude from the US.`
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:04:06
The stick is nothing more than the keys. The BTC in the wallet actually live on the BlockChain. It is possible that an attacker could steel your keys or seed when you are setting up the UBS stick. Then when it is offline, they could steal the funds because they already have the keys.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:50:18
Software wallets are only as secure as the device that runs the software. I agree with your ranking.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:01:43
I don't know the specifics of the Trezor, but I pretty confident that your wallet is still offline and the physical device has hardware security procedures built in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:16:57
If you mean their site, it loads for meno problem.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:24:21
Correct, my brain probably just processed a word wrong that resulted in me recording the wrong one. i.e. Fight vs Flight
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:35:35
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:03:49
Do you mean passphrase or seed words?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:40:31
By GUI do you mean on the computer GUI or on the devices hardware GUI?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:28:02
It can be. But handwriting your keys opens the door to a lot of error as the keys are random cryptic hashes.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:16:35
Which one did you buy?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:37:20
Yes, transferring cryptocurrencies anywhere incur a fee.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:51:52
Moving any cryptocurrency between wallets requires fee's.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:07:28
Yes, Coinbase says they have insurance, but insurance payouts are never guaranteed and are completely at the discretion of the insurance company. They also do not insure breaches on individual accounts, so if someone compromises your email account or Coinbase password and transfers the funds away, they are gone.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:43:18
I would do your research and determine which seller is the proper Ledger Nano S company.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:03:17
I will agree, that when you LNS is connected to a computer it is most at risk. But I don't think it is necessary to rebuild the LNS with a new seed every-time you transact with it. Maybe once a year or something like that just to be extra safe.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:59
It could possibly be either.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:26:44
Yes I agree. A passphrase is important to. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:48:23
Yes this is a good practice if you can spare the funds for the device purchases. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:57:45
When initiating the transaction, you will see the fee's broken out. This is pretty standard practice.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:10:33
Check Amazon. At one point Ledger was selling them via Amazon. That might work out better for you. Just make sure if you see it on Amazon that it is sold by the Ledger company, not a reseller.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:36:47
What questions do you have?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:40:45
No. If a 1 BTC is worth 17,000 USD it doesn't matter where that BTC lives, it is worth that much. But if you ever wanted to convert it back to USD, you would have to move it to an exchange to sell it for USD.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:01:33
Enjoy the peace of mind! Don't forget to test your seed before you transfer the bulk of the funds.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:23:12
I don't use Electrum, but I would advise checking out their website to fully understand the security standard they use and the recommended recovery processies.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:05:29
While software wallets can be pretty secure, you have to remember that they can only be as secure as the device they live on.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:46:16
It depends on how much you are planning to buy. It might be overkill if you are just getting started but that depends on your specific situation. Best of luck and welcome to the cryptocurrency space!
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:37:32
Yes, Coinbase appears to be one of the more secure platforms out there but when it comes down to it, you are still trusting a massive corporation and people you do not know with your money. It is always safer to control it yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:42:08
You can keep cryptocurrency and fiat currencies inside of GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:50:58
No, wallets are not exchanges. GDAX supports limit and stop orders but only on funds that are stored with the GDAX exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:30:48
Unfortunately, nothing is 100% safe. If someone tells you a system is 100% safe they are lying to you. I personally don't know much about Green Address so I can say if it is safe or now. But in looking at their site, they seem to be using some solid security practices for a cloud based solution.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:13:22
It is really up to you. For me personally I keep ~2,000 USD worth in GDAX at any given time. That is the amount I am OK losing if something happens. Ask yourself what is your comfort amount. If it is over 500 then I say don't worry about it. But if it is under that then it is worth it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:51:03
Different devices use different standards. The LNS uses a 24 word seed which is more secured then a 12 word. Some even use 48 word seeds.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:23:19
Yes, Trezor's are a good option as well.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:39:34
Yes you can do it like that or buy a second ledger and enter your seed to see if it recovers your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:05
They are very similar. I choose the LNS over Trezor because the day I was buying it, it was cheaper. It also looks more durable to me which isn't really important.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:19:50
Yes, I would recommend temporarily moving the bulk of your funds off, then testing a restore. Or buy a second LNS and test your seems on the second device. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:30:27
I would recommend you buy from the source, not a reseller to make sure it isn't compromised.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:18:47
USB keys don't have physical button on them which means you enter your pin or passphrase via keyboard on a computer. Someone could be monitoring your keystrokes on your computer.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:26:29
I can't say for sure because I don't know the specifics of you device and how it is configured. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:46:46
That depends on how busy the blockchain is. I have had some transactions be confirmed in a matter of minutes and some take multiple hours.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:44:04
We know very little about the insurance policy for Coinbase and GDAX. I personally am not willing to risk it. This is like saying I am not going to change lanes to avoid hitting the car in front of me, I have insurance so I will get it repaired after I crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:08:49
Hope For Paws is an excellent organization. I give to them yearly.
[ 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:02:38
I am not aware of any US based reputable hardware wallet. I am in the US though and bought the LNS and had zero issues with it being foreign.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:47:11
Can you scan the QR code? Make sure you are using a receive address from the LNS.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:17:45
I unfortunately don't have enough knowledge to be comfortable advising on this type of cold storage, but I do want to learn more about it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:26:59
Yes, transferring to a wallet is like any other coin transfer it has fee's. But if you use the right exchange, like GDAX vs Coinbase, the fees will be minimal.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:19:48
For security reasons, I don't provide specifics on how I protect my seeds. As for storying the private key, that is perfectly acceptable, but dictionary words are far easier to record and/or memorize than a random cryptic hash.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:15:02
The seed is the 24 word collection that the LNS will give you. Think of it as a readable key to the kingdom. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:09:55
The LNS uses a 24 word seed to encrypt your data. It is a collection of 24 random words that when in a specific order act as the key to your encrypted funds.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:10:08
Hopefully my post has provided you some helpful insight.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:13:55
Trezor is good, but I don't think either is better than the other. They are both pretty solid options.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:04:34
I own 2 as well. It is best.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:56:51
Fee's are related to the BTC transfer, not the service. But some services will up-charge on the default BTC fee's to support their infrastructure.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:00:47
Paper degrades overtime and can get lost or damaged.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:45:38
Yes, I believe all cryptocurrencies are like that. It is just like traditional currencies. The "value" is just a perceived value, meaning someone things it is worth that much. They don't care if they are getting the dollar bill in your wallet or the dollar bill in your safe. A dollar is a dollar and a BTC is and BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:45:52
That is just a normal software wallet. It is less secure than hardware wallets and paper wallets but slightly more secure than storing your BTC with an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:59:23
People steal and hack cellphones every day. Everything can be "hacked". Nothing is 100% secure. Breadwallet is a software wallet, it is not a hardware wallet because it has no hardware. Mobile phones are designed to be internet connected devices. Hardware wallets are designed specifically to protect keys.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:34:26
Someone could already be recording your keystrokes. You never know.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:13:56
Correct, I wanted to fully understand the process and the device before I trusted it so I "played" with it for a while. As for sending funds you can send and receive as small or as large of funds as you want as many times as you want. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:14:21
Glad to help.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:58:39
They do not because nothing actually lives on the hardware device except for keys and those keys can be backed up via the seed words. Also, Bitcoin is a decentralized and semi anonymous currency, so there is not identifiable paper trail to insure.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:38:18
Not hard at all, it is just like any other wallet. You will get a Bitcoin Address and QR code, then you just send the money to that address and it will show up after a variable amount of time.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:22:24
I agree with this. I have already started dividing my coins up into various locations.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:20:38
Glad to help. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:23:32
Yes. I some how recorded the seed wrong. I most likely misspelled a word or saw one word and wrote another one. i.e. fight vs flight
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:56:33
USB keys don't have physical buttons on them which means you enter your pin or passphrase via keyboard on a computer. Someone could be monitoring your keystrokes on your computer.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:58:02
I am glad you have decided to order one! I might also recommend learning more about cryptocurrancies, because they are not just about investing and converting back to USD. They are the future of the worlds economy and currency. Checkout one of my other posts, it has resources to learn more and fully understand cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:59:38
Yes, I most likely wrote the seed down wrong. Either misspelled something or my brain flubbed on the word. i.e. Fight vs flight
As of right now, the $5 which is probably worth much more is still lost. But I still do have that flubbed seed, so I might revisit is and try to figure out my mistake to retrieve it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:26:58
You are not at mercy of the company. They use a standard called BIP39. You can restore your wallet to any BIP39 / BIP 44 software/hardware wallet with just your seed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:39:25
You can reset the device and restore the wallets via your 24 seed words.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:01:08
I keep about $2k worth in GDX for everyday transactions and trading. Anything over that goes in the Ledger. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:29:04
I use Crypto Pro and just manually enter the approximate amount of BTC I know is my wallet. If I send or recieve from my wallet I update the appropriate BTC amount in the app. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:06:58
If it is sold by Ledger through Amazon then you are probably fine. But I wouldn't buy from a reseller on Amazon. Also, when I was originally reaching the LNS, it was more expensive on Amazon then it was buying direct.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:12:09
Most software wallets are pretty good with security, but just keep in mind that they are only as secure as the device they live on.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:43:32
I agree, it is a legitimate concern. That is why I suggest people put a exchange balance limit in place. For instance say your limit is $200. When you balance on the exchange of your choice reached that number you transfer $200 of it out to the LNS. I encourage people to pick a limit that they are comfortable with. You just have to ask yourself, and I comfortable losing $xxxx.xx if my account is hacked.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:20:19
Humm, unfortunately, the only option is to get Chrome installed. Hopefully you make enough with Bitcoin that you can buy a new laptop!
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:18:30
That is why I mention testing in the original post. Once you run a full test, you will fully understand the device and will be more confident in using it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:53:04
If Bitcoin is valued at 16,000 USD, if doesn't matter if the BTC is in a wallet or in an exchange, it is still worth 16k. BTC do not stop growing in value if they are put into a wallet. The reason I keep a small amount in the exchange is for easy buying and selling if I want to trade or make actual BTC purchases.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:31:09
Th Ledger Nano S supports both Bitcoin and Litecoin. It also supports multiple wallets on one device.
You can see all of the "Companion Apps" the LNS supports here:  (scroll down a bit)
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:06:39
You can easily restore via your seed on any other BIP39/BIP44 wallet. That is the standard they use. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:36:57
Check your downloads file for the Chrome installer. You might have to run that. A lot of times, when you click download on the site, it is only downloading a installer. Then you have to run the installer to get the app downloaded and installed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:33
It really is just personal preference and what each person is most comfortable with possibly losing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:48:03
Your statement is correct. I unfortunately can't fully explain the technology in a single comment, but the non-technical gist of is: No actual funds live on the hardware device. Bitcoin lives in the blockchain network. The hardware wallet contains the key to access your funds on the blockchain and that key is encrypted via the seed words. So, if you have the seed you have access to the key which in turn gives you access to your funds on the blockchain network.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:08:52
Feel free to private message me when you are doing it and I could help walk you through it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:21:37
Not from within the wallet. GDAX does support stop and limit sells, but only for funds stored at the exchange. I personally just use Crypto Pro on iOS to setup alerts to notify me of any major swings in price.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:46:51
Anytime bitcoin moves between 2 accounts you pay fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:11:08
I haven't heard that. But that doesn't mean it isn't true.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:34:11
I was nervous the first time I did it as well, so just start small. Once you understand the complete process from start to reset, you will feel more confident about it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:52:22
It looks like your questions got answered, but a bit of advise: I picked one up 2 weeks ago and I would recommend setting it up, sending a super small amount of bitcoin to it (I did about $3). Then reset it and rebuild it using your seed to make sure you recorded it correctly. The first time I did this, I lost my $3 because my Seed didn’t work. I am glad it was only $3 and not my full haul. The second time it worked right and now I know my recorded Seed is good to go and my funds are safe. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:16:19
Demand hasn't been a problem for me. I bought a second one on Black Friday and it was received in 4 business days.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:38:07
It is really up to you. You need to know what you limit is. Ask your self, if I lost my Coinbase balance tomorrow would I care? If the answer is yes then make the switch.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:50:10
Technically, you don't, but that is true for any wallet, exchange, or cryptocurrency service. Nothing is 100% secure.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:47:43
As I said on your other similar comment. It is subjective. I have had some transactions be confirmed in a matter of minutes and some take multiple hours.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:44:55
It is always possible to get hacked.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:25:49
I tested my recovery seed 3 times. The first it failed and I lost the $5. The second time was successful and I saw my $5. The third time was just to put my kind at ease and to double confirm. But honestly, one successful test should be enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:27:11
You can normally see the fee's before you click send, so I would just recommend playing around with it to see what is best for you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:08:28
Multiple people have asked for a specific guide in the comments, so I might try to put something together if I can find the time.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:37:19
You can't brute force the pin because it has to be entered via the devices hardware buttons and the LNS will erase the device after 3 failed pin attempts.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:08:45
That is the great thing about LNS it doesn't matter if it gets lost, stolen or damaged. As long as you have the seed and the device is protected by a pin you are covered for all of these situations. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:19:04
Most of this is discussed in greater detail in the comments on my original post, but here is my quick answers:
1. The LNS does not store any actual coins. This is true for all devices. The accounts are all stored on the blockchain. The LNS is storying the keys.
2. If you lose your LNS and it is protected by a pin, you don't need to worry. Any LNS can be restored as long as you have your 24 word seed. The pin is what protects access to the lost device, but the seed words are all you need to restore.
3. The amount of time it takes to move assets is not a LNS thing, it is how long will it take to have a transaction verified with the blockchain. I have had transactions go as quick as 30 minutes and some go as long as 8 hours. It just depends on how busy the block chain is.
I hope this helps!
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:54:35
Coinbase cryptocurrency accounts are not insured by FDIC, they are insured by a private insurance company. Only their USD wallet accounts are FDIC insured.
The fee's are so minimal, especially if you transfer via GDAX that it is worth it for the peace of mind.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:20:51
Just what is in my original post. Test before you transfer your full funds! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:07:56
For sure. It is your call. Paper wallets work perfectly fine for many people. Best of luck!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:12:32
Haha hopefully not!
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:07:24
Depending on how much you have I would recommend a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S. I started using one a few weeks ago and it has been working great.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:06:51
Not an ad at all. I don't work in the cryptocurrency space at all. I am just a normal dude who has spent a lot of time understanding cryptocurrencies and how to secure them. I just wanted to share my 2 cents on the matter. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:11:05
You are very welcome. Thank you for the praise.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:39:20
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:11:10
They do not, but the website is fully responsive. I added their website to my phones homescreen so it seems like a app.
If you are looking to monitor GDAX prices and get alerts, some others apps will monitor GDAX. I use Crypto Pro. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:02:37
Store what you can in hardware wallets for the currancies that are supported then keep the rest on paper or in a software wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:22:50
Yes and yes.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:24:46
With the recent spike in BTC activity in the world, I am not surprised that they might be a bit behind on manufacturing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:47:11
What questions do you have?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:00:11
I can't vouch for bitaddress.org. I have never used it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:44
Regarding storying your seed, only you know what is the best option. If you live in a city, then a safety deposit box is probably a good thing. But if you live on a farm, recording the seed in steel and burying it on your property might be the right approach. It is all dependent on your specific situation.
If Ledger goes out of business, you can still retrieve your funds they use the BIP39 standard. So any BIP39/44 device can restore them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:15:20
You are not wrong. I think it is completely up to the person on how far they want to take security. It also really depends on how much currency you have to store.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:46:03
I will try to put something together. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:05
The process around forks is going to be different every-time, so I can't say for sure how it will work for all forks in general.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:31:29
If you want to buy or sell, then yes you would use Coinbase or GDAX again. I also mentioned in the original post that I keep a small amount in GDAX at any given time for easy accessability with trading and transactions. But it is an amount I am OK losing if there is a security breach. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:16:38
The keyword in your comment is "they say". We also don't know how the keys are protected in the cold storage. What if that cold storage is stolen? If it is encrypted, who holds those keys? Controlling your own keys is always the best approach. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:32:59
No. If you lose your LNS, you can buy a new one and restore your wallets with your seed. The LNS also supports a pin, so if someone steals it, they can't access your device without your pin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:13
At this time, I think paper wallets are the best option for ALT Coins.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:41:36
The LNS provides the seed words to you. The device doesn't need to be plugin when being stored. It does require a computer if you want to interact with your wallet though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:26:10
Yes, nothing is 100% secure. If someone tells you something is 100% secure, they are lying to you.
