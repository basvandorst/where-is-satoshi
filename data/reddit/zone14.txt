I don't know any of the schools or techniques or theory but I did manage to 'get it' first time of trying about four years ago.  Here's a few useful things I took from some youtube videos I watched initially:
- Don't keep your mind from wandering, your mind wandering is fine, just notice it, laugh it off like "ha! minds wandering again... interesting...".  It's as if the thought is fluttering by in front of your eyes and will drift out of your periphery again in a few seconds.
- If you need to focus on something, focus on the exact sensations of your breathing you may not have paid attention to before.  I like to try to gradually notice every part of my body first, like "oh my feet are warm, there's a tingle in my left ankle" etc.  Then I try to breathe with my nose up, as if I'm breathing the air to store it in between my eyes.  I'll notice the feeling as my stomach contracts, the warmth in the back of your mouth then the tingle between the eyes.  I initially breathe softly out through my mouth but eventually you'll naturally stop focusing on it as your breathing becomes automatic again.
- Keeping my feet planted helps.
- I don't do this all the time but if I'm struggling I start by picturing myself in the space I'm in now, I picture the items around me, the colours of the walls, I picture myself sat there and what I'd look like to someone stood behind me.  After this I gradually zoom out, I picture the square mile around me, the cars moving, the people sat in their gardens or walking into the shops and again I try to work myself into that image, sat in a chair in my house.  Now my whole town, 100 miles, sometimes my mind wanders here "oh there's that city 200 miles away that my friend moved to, there he is walking down the street on lunch" and again relate the distance and ambience back to myself.  For me the imagined pictures are never hectic as life can feel, the more you zoom out, the calmer and slower everything is, that isn't a conscious decision, just how it happens for me which is strange because my immediate life and work can be lightning paced.  Eventually I can reach a calm where I like to play around with 'moving myself' to different places and spaces, even millions of miles away but sat exactly as I am now, the same calm is everywhere and even if I'm sat on the moon my state of mind is still flat.  That's probably little out there and not even meditation but it definitely helps my body reach that dull vibration and switch off.
- I don't know if this is what people are supposed to feel but when it 'works', I feel very slightly cross-eyed and there's a tingle/tickle between my eyebrows, my feet and ass feel really heavy and when it REALLY works I start swaying, it's like I'm in a basket on a really calm sea, feels like my body is just swaying/rocking forwards and backwards really gently.
- When it works and you get up and move around, the sense of perspective is so weird, it's like you can see behind you and you notice colours of objects you hadn't really thought about before, woodgrain on that bedside lamp, white paint on the doorknob to the wardrobe.  Also everything is mildly amusing and less serious, kind of like a mild high.

*Hoping someone more experienced corrects me here if I'm wrong.*
I'm a fellow newbie but getting a feel for the population and the rhythm and the PR lingo, my read is this:
It's been skyrocketing as people prepare to freeroll off the fork, some amount of fiat coming in from mainstream coverage of the absurd august growth but mostly just existing portfolios weighing more towards BTC from the alts, temporarily until November.
Lot of discussion the past few days about whether the forkedcoins will actually sell and the temptation of now heavily discounted alts has shifted the market back slightly the other way but btc still doesn't take a hit as it's still riding a wave of newcomers from the past 2 months.
Alts market could do anything short-term? I assume newbies are more reflexive meaning higher-highs and lower-lows?
There will probably also be some extra heat from mainstream coverage if it crosses $5000 next week, not sure how true this is historically, I remember reading the news in 2013 at $1000 and thought, as I assume most did - *"well it's too late now..."*
Can't see anything but a relaxed coast to $5200+ for 3 weeks and from there, who knows?
