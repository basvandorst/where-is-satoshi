Let's be mature, ok?

I used to listen to Peter Schiff and to be honest, he's not all that different from other podcasts. He's always been loud and vocal about his views. If anything, what he is saying about the USD, US's economy, his clients, all point to bullish signals for alternatives like gold and bitcoin. So I wouldn't pay too much attention to his view on bitcoin as I feel he's a bit ignorant, but I wouldn't discount other views of his.
At any rate, HODL!

I filed a formal complaint with [ I doubt it'll make any difference but I'm really desperate at this point.

You are awesome. Simply awesome!

At least they are not taking your money without giving any updates. Coinbase has my money and it's been sitting in their account for about a week now. I am stuck and they won't do anything about it. Coinbase needs to be held accountable for their actions (or lack of).

Awesome! Out of curiosity, did you put a market order in and just got lucky or was it one of shoot for the moon sorta wish type of a limit order that got filled? Man, I’d be ecstatic!
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:09:40


Not anymore. Their CS sucks. If they are so great at what they're doing, then why is it that they are continuing to take money and signing up new customers without providing any help. I understand that they're overloaded but that does not make it right to leave "about half a million people" hanging without access to their hard earned money.
For that reason, Coinbase/GDAX deserves people leaving this company for others.

6 days and counting.. can’t wait to get approved for another alternative.
