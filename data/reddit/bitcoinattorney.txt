Of course, but I take big issue with saying it's not an attorney's filed to understand bitcoins. Attorneys practice in a near infinite number of fields and will make bitcoins their business, it's just whether they do it reasonably or fearfully. I'm trying to make sure we start reasonably.

Not exactly. I have no problem with the American system of government. As I said, I love America and believe its government structure is a strong one. 
That said, I believe a lot of the people IN that government are there for the wrong reasons and are the problem. Bitcoin allows the currently boxed out citizens to once again have a voice.
More importantly, it demands we re-look at our legal structure surrounding the economy. Our old laws just don't fit into how Bitcoins work. Since Bitcoins are a reality, and gaining strength throughout the world, we have to sort of start from scratch legally.
There is, for better or for worse, going to be regulation on Bitcoin. Look at the New York hearings and you'll know that doesn't have to be the worst thing in the world if we have intelligent people in the room drafting that legislation/regulation. And either way, it's exciting.

These hacks, no matter how small, terrify the public. I know an analogy would be a bank being robbed, but at least that money is partially insured. What's the consensus on why these hacks shouldn't be much of a concern? Or what steps are being implemented to stop them?

I honestly don't understand all of that, I'm no economist. I'm not saying the USD is forever, but I think it's ridiculous to think it will fall any time soon. The regulation is coming. It's up to everyone invested in bitcoins to go into the conversation level headed and reasonable. Anarchists will be there, and they will get the headlines, but they will *only* hurt. I promise.

I hear what you're saying, but my concern is that complacency will allow the fear mongering to continue and only grow stronger, to a point where the regulation that DOES come will be so anti-innovation bitcoin will drown in it.

Well that kind of attitude won't get us anywhere :) "you and your cronies." 
I'm not a law maker. I'm a lawyer. Potentially one trying to help the bitcoin community by defending it and voicing intelligent legal opinions on future proposed legislation. Same as you can, except I have a pretty license. 
I'm not a senator. No one is in my pocket from the big banks. I'm a normal person who wants to see digital currencies succeed. Also, if you think USD is collapsing tomorrow, then that's a bad sign for this community.

I couldn't agree more on the regulation front. It's absolutely coming, and anyone refusing to negotiate on that will only hurt bitcoin. Folding your arms and covering your ears will only create *much* worse legislation. Being at the table for honest discussion and debate will pave the way for a brighter future for all involved. 
Thanks for this! Also, unfortunately, people don't even consider bitcoin a fad any longer. They consider it a passed fad. As in, it came, it did alright, it's gone. I'm talking about what your average Joe American believes. Hopefully that's incorrect, and I'm here to do what I can to make sure it is.

As an attorney, Bitcoin is a way to really reexamine a lot of awful legislation and existing loopholes in (only because it is where I reside and know the laws of) the American economy. 
As the gap between poor and rich grows each day, so does the removal of protections and addition of loopholes for those rich citizens who own a lobbyist or ten and have a hand in the pocket of many legislators, state and federal. 
It's frustrating to sit on the sideline and believe there is so much wrong with the system on a technical level and not be able to change anything, even with a law license. 
I love America, so don't take this as an attack on my nation at all. The problem is there are bad people in every profession, and Bitcoin is a real way to let the powerless once again have a voice about that.

Even if that's true, it's not happening. You have to play by their rules, and win, to actually change anything. That's still very possible with bitcoin.

"It's hard to explain quickly" is the biggest issue, unfortunately. I know it sucks, but most people want bullet point explanations.

Happy to help :)
