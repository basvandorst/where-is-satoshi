unfortunately this sub has become polluted with people like you who don't actually get it - people who don't even understand the very first thing about the technology or why it matters, but are apparently willing to gamble with their own money on a tech they don't get - then complain about daily fluctuations. Here's a word of advice - there will always be fluctuation in any stock or commodity. But it's the trend that matters. Will it be up in 10 years? 20? That's the question you should be asking yourself.
People come to this sub from off the street then act like they're entitled to share their completely ill-informed dismissive opinions amongst people who are actually ahead of the curve and understand the tech (people who have known about bitcoin and believed in it, and understood it, since you could buy one for $4).
So before you go spreading FUD, ask yourself, do I actually have even the first idea of what I'm talking about? Am I the dunning Kruger effect? Have I put the least bit of research into substantiating my viewpoint? Do I actually have the right to share an opinion on a public forum? Do I have the right to have an opinion, like so many misinformed fake news media outlets, and spread BS that you haven't actually given a moment's thought to?
BTC is not a "gamble". A gamble is when you roll a dice and bet on the outcome. BTC is an unprecedented solution to the inequities and abuse of power by governments and the financial industry. It's a disruptive technology designed to give the power back to the people and away from banks. It's as much a political statement as it is a tech startup. It's the difference between over regulated taxi industries and Uber. 
If you don't even understand this, what are you doing on a Bitcoin forum acting like you have an opinion that's worth sharing?
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:12:36
the answer to your question is this - it starts with investment. after the huge gains, everyone wants in. Eventually, everyone owns bitcoin - and once that happens, no one wants a taxable event by converting it into dollars. So there's demand for people to spend their bitcoin directly. Additionally, as the price of bitcoin keeps rising, theres a high demand for crypto assets, so businesses will readily accept bitcoin payments as the potential for growth is so much higher than inflationary fiat.
tl;dr: price goes up. people buy. people want to spend in btc to avoid tax. businesses want btc as its seen as a more valuable, stable growth based currency.
also we're forgetting the use cases of overseas travel and online spending. plus much of the developed world. also not to forget the fact it will naturally gain in value every year - making it a much more attractive way to store your money than fiat for the everyday person (once the price stabilises due to enough people being invested and enough confidence).
fiat only works because there's no alternative. and because theres no alternative, governments are able to take advantage of their monopoly to print more, or through corruption allow banks to print money. either way it costs the every man to the gain of the fat cats. BTC is a way to tip the balance back in favour of the people.
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:35:28
We're still talking about measuring btc against other currencies. But we're using the wrong word. We should talk about the ***value*** of a BTC in USD, *not* the *price* of a BTC in USD.

@_date: 2017-12-17 07:08:16
This growth isn’t based on short term profit. If it were, we would all have sold by now and be sitting on astronomical amounts of fiat currency. This growth is because we’re collectively trying to write a better future, where bitcoin is an ultra transportable store of wealth and alternative to the inequalities and inefficiencies of leaving your wealth to the hands of the powers that be. Anything is possible, remember that. I calculate btc to have a price of 660k per unit for it to reach the same market cap as the USD. Remember, people without imagination or freedom
of thought can’t possibly conceive of a better system than the one which currently operates.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:48:09
I disagree. There is a fixed supply of bitcoins, just as there is a fixed supply of gold, platinum, diamond, etc. As I understand it, only gold is the agreed upon standard as set by the free market. There’s nothing to stop me from making a knock off a Facebook, but without users, what’s the value?

American goods are always bought in American dollars. The higher the number of American dollars there are on the market, the cheaper and easier they are to acquire for a foreigner. So the US government wants to print more US dollars in order to increase the supply on the world market. A cheaper USD means its cheaper for overseas buyers to buy goods in American dollars because it's easier to get a lot of USD for less of their own currency than before.
The small problem is of course it's now much more expensive for US citizens to travel overseas or buy foreign goods. I'm guessing from a geopolitical standpoint the US wants to make sure their economy can still function without China by encouraging domestic production.

The payment you receive is in the form of increases to the value of the currency that you own. Work done to promote its cause will result in gains to this effect. Lightning Network, answering questions from the public, spreading the word to friends and family, are all roles traditionally serviced by employees of an organisation or entity. Holders of cryptocurrency perform these roles as they have a vested interest in its success.

Not really. I dare say I think you’ve drunk the fiat coolaid. Btc isn’t about the tech - it’s about taking money out of the hands of self interested, centralized big daddy’s. It’s about certainty that no one is going to start a trade war with your currency. That it means more than a signed piece of paper in your wallet. That’s why it matters. The tech is just the enabler. 
The fiat doesn’t need to be destroyed. You couldn’t destroy it fast enough to outpace those big hot printing presses of the government. But the value can sink like a lead weight. 
Third point, fair enough. Personally I think that’ll get sorted.

A part owner is someone who in part owns an entity. A holder of cryptocurrency in part owns a piece of that currency proportional to the amount that they own. Their decisions can affect how that currency grows, by when and if they choose to sell. As bitcoin has no official staff, it's up those who stand to benefit from the success of crypto who are incentivised to do the work involved, through education and marketing, as well as by volunteering time, effort and resources.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:46:55
I think you're right. But an unhealthy ecosystem is one prone to artificial interference from biased forces - it's undemocratic, monopolistic and leads to worse outcomes for the common man via unfettered fiscal/monetary policy (arguably). I see BTC as a long term replacement for the USD for foreign cash reserves - as soon as countries like China and Russia have a stable alternative to the USD they'll be able to control their own currencies with it, and simultaneously flood the market with treasury bonds sending the USD into collapse. I'd even go as far as to say that the BTC price explosion we're witnessing could be viewed more accurately as the relative hyperinflation of every other currency than BTC. But by my estimation, for BTC to reach the market cap of USD, it would need to have a price per unit of around $600,000USD in today's terms. Remembering that the global population outnumbers the US 20:1. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:30:27

I’m using gold as an agreed currency standard with fixed supply (essentially) to simply get an idea of how they compare supply side. I’m using scarcity not as an absolute but more as a limitation on supply - both Btc and gold
are fixed supply, infinitely divisible stores of wealth, with real world utility, based on trust and subject to market forces.
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:00:21
Yup. Only as dirty as the power used to generate it. Also, to compare apples for apples, how many trees are cut down, and much hydrocarbon turned into plastic, to print fiat. Not to mention the USD is an oil backed currency. BTC is backed by mathematics (and the sun, potentially).

@_date: 2019-06-04 04:40:10
Thank you, that was a very good read. 
I have a few points to make. First, you argue that the existence of alt coins predicates a multi-coin future. However, I wonder if we can compare the sphere of crypto currencies with Betamax with VHS. Ultimately only be one agreed format can exist, so as to better facilitate communication, which is what I see money as. Whatever most people use will lead to its domination as people will gravitate towards one agreed standard. 
You might however draw comparisons to the social media sphere - we have Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and the like - but still, all utilise a common login system of Facebook, which is the agreed standard. I think Bitcoin is the facebook of Crypto now - and once adoption takes place we will gravitate to one agreed standard, as that is the most efficient, liquidity notwithstanding.
On the liquidity point, I wonder, how does your modelling account for a case where a Bitcoin becomes the standard form of currency but only appreciates in value of around 5% per year, consistently? How do you see this dependable figure as changing the economic landscape? I've read that as long as we can anticipate deflation and inflation, markets can compensate, so some say it's not a big issue. 
Also, how would you respond to the idea that printing money is potentially a lazy way to stimulate the economy, and without this, government's would have to find better, more efficient, and more creative uses of our tax dollars, such as by funding education and the like? And relatedly, do you view government and bank money printing to be an open avenue to potential corruption, market manipulation and abuse of power?

Nice write up, and good to hear the negative side of the picture also getting some airtime. However I take a bit of issue with your example of the deflationary effect on borrowing, for two reasons. First, by the time BTC hypothetically became THE currency, I think its value would have stabilised to the point where its deflation would only be a product of more market entrants, I.e. the next generation wanting in -  not its relative value on the market in terms of buying power compared with other currencies. Correct me if I'm wrong. So the effect won't be anywhere near as extreme as in your example - and may even be completely negligible. Correct if  wrong.
Second, if such a scenario did occur, then surely the person who purchased the car would have other holdings of BTC, which should also gain in purchasing power massively? - so the problem should be offset, unless he borrowed his whole net worth and had no other currency other than that which he borrowed, which is a terrible idea to begin with. **As well, isn't the price of BTC relative to fiat?** \-  so the deflation of its purchasing power wouldn't make sense at that scale on the global market - it wouldn't be gaining value, everything else would just be deflating at that point. So purchasing power would stay the same.
And even if this was an issue, wouldn't it just do away with people borrowing excessively, and mean that markets really had to compete on price, resulting in natural downward pressure on the cost of housing, which is currently reliant on near limitless amounts of cash being conjured up to pay for ever increasing house prices?
Again, I'm no economist, so take it all with a grain of salt, but I don't see the deflation as being as extreme a factor as you laid out. Plus, if it were as extreme as that, yes you have to pay back 1btc that can now purchase a million dollars worth of goods and services - but every other BTC you own can as well - so unless you attempted to borrow your entire net worth and you were flat broke, my napkin economics says it shouldn't matter. Over to you, or someone else, who can correct me.
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:41:47
That's not it. It's value comes from the users. The more people that use the network the more value it has. Facebook is just a worthless collection of ones and zeros, except that three quarters of the world's population use it, and it fills an important role in people's lives. The "trust" or "belief" thing is missing the point IMO.

@_date: 2019-05-13 07:30:43
Sure, that's true now - with the current volatility it's not obviously not ideal. But that's to be expected - we've got a big old mountain to climb - or a swamp to drain - before we see the price stabilising for it to be used as a currency. But we can just let that happen naturally - if the time is right. If not, we'll have to wait. But when the time is right, nature will take its course, and the dam will break - maybe it'll be a slow leak, growing to a torrent? Maybe it will take many years. But I believe some kind of cryptocurrency is the way of the future. 
Once it settles, or gains a modest amount in value every year, we'll see those benefits coming to life.

Any number of arguments. It's exactly the same as normal currency, just without any of the problems. It's pure. It's simple. It's global. It flows like water. By every metric, it beats out controlled currencies that are at the behest of corrupt, ignorant and self serving governments that in this day and age are closer to organised gangs than they are to democratic institutions working for the people. 
If water takes the path of least resistance, so too does money. The money will flow through whatever path is fastest, easiest, and cheapest. And cryptocurrencies are the winner by all three measures. 
Furthermore, as outlined above, governments will print as much cash as they can get away with, which devalues your currency. As well, traditional currency is centralised, meaning its vulnerable to domestic politics and domestic economies. 
The whole idea of currency trading is incredibly inefficient. If I need to send money around the world, say for an online purchase of any kind, why must I pay 10% in fees and place my trust in untold numbers of middlemen to send my funds through a complex network of people skimming and robbing me? Why not send it straight to the point, in the same currency sent as received, with the same utility at either end? It's like a language that everyone can speak. It's beautiful, and it's the future.

Wait, but who is the benefactor of this newly printed money? who is increasing the demand for shares?

Well many currencies are just different words printed on paper. It's the idea that's important. Anyone can create their own currency but there can only be one agreed standard. I could make a new Facebook, a counterfeit, but without brand recognition and users it's pretty much useless.
@_date: 2019-05-29 18:55:59
I don't think personally that it's so simple that growth and technological development are inextricably linked. E.g., facebook was not necessarily reliant on 'growth' 
Also, what exactly is growth anyway? Is it just another word for inflation? Who benefits when money is released into the economy, and can good ideas only be enabled by 'growth'? 
Doesn't more jobs = higher demand for currency = higher value of currency = lower denominations of currency paid for as wages = no difference in real terms? 
Interesting topics. I'd be interested to read some articles on this if you have any links

@_date: 2019-05-29 17:24:57
Interesting. So the rich essentially borrow as much newly printed paper as possible, buy stocks, inflate the stock market, then pay back the loans at a reduced rate by taking advantage of the resultant currency devaluation? Is the mechanic that the rich get loans to pay for stocks? or is there some other method? E.g. I know big business is able to manipulate government any way they please through corporate donations etc - so is there a way for them to essentially buy money at less than face value?
@_date: 2019-05-13 06:06:04
Spoken like someone who obviously missed the boat.
@_date: 2019-05-31 01:05:24
Interesting points. Growth being everything that happened since caveman times - this includes periods of currency backed to sound money like Gold, or gold itself as currency, does it not? although the most rapid growth has been post currency decoupling from gold - but that's also coincided with the most technological advancement. Again, it's hard to separate these two. 
I think advancement is more to do with the free market. And the free market being mixed with government control leads us to a situation where free market entrepreneurs can manipulate governments into printing money for the benefit of the rich - not so much that the idea of inflation has necessarily stimulated technological progress. I tend to see a deflationary economy as disincentivising excess and giving a higher real value to currency, meaning people will make better decisions with a more real and direct idea of where their income is coming from and what it actually means in reality, without the fog surrounding inflation and the value of currency. So businesses will less try and sell useless goods and instead have to compete to provide value to consumers above and beyond the inherent value of their currency. The game may get harder, but it may also get more rewarding as a consequence. And better for the environment.
Also, on your money borrowing point - perhaps in your example the idea of borrowing money will give way to simply waiting for deflation to accumulate to the point where you can afford what it is you want? So rather than borrow from a financial institution, you just "spend" time waiting. In the event that the currency value is holding steady for long periods, then you can borrow from someone. 
I think things will actually move slowly but surely - e.g., you will be 10% richer each year owing to global population growth and economic growth, which is dependable - and that this might have repercussions on aggregate financial investments, willingness to invest in property, share market etc - which may actually make those capital assets less volatile because of it.
Also - Isn’t the idea in monopoly, that if one person wins, someone else has to lose? Isn’t the idea of inflation a way to make everyone win? But who really loses? Where is the true cost? Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be changed. So where is the energy coming from? Is it from fossil fuels? Overseas slave labour? Or are we all losing in ways we can’t yet imagine - i.e. will the cost come at a later date?

Third - yes debts are harder to service. But what about the net increase in purchasing power? Doesn't that factor as well, the positive, in addition to the negative? Maybe lending is only as high as it is because of this limitless free money banks are pouring out, which brings me to -
Fourth - you write that creditors just move money around. How do you figure Fractional Reserve Banking into this? The banks are lending money they literally don't have - which is the biggest driver of inflation in our economy today.

Right. So the currency would be seen as deflationary. Which would encourage saving, and discourage rampant consumerism - people would be much more careful about what they buy, and much more price conscious. I agree that we possibly couldn't maintain our current economic lifestyles based on free money in a Bitcoin future. But I wonder if it would be so bad, or maybe more natural. As you say, population growth would slow. Maybe our currency crisis creates some kind of false sense of abundance? 
Not sure about your last paragraph. I said two things - first, if BTC did massively deflate while you were paying off your car loan - presumably, you would have other BTC, so the difference might be offset. But then, if you could have afforded the car outright, you should've bought it. But then, cars aren't the most environmentally friendly things either, so maybe it's not so bad if less people choose to buy them. I guess we move into a dual currency economy - BTC for saving, and fiat for borrowing - that way, the deflation only benefits you as you have less to pay on your loans - but then, why would the banks lend this fiat, if they're better off just holding BTC - assuming of course they aren't just printing money due to FRB so makes no difference. 
I feel as though maybe it's all just more natural and environmentally friendly to have one sound money currency. In a sense, we live in a sound world - there's only so much space, so much water. Growth doesn't really do anything for anyone, and doesn't really have much to do with innovation. In a way - yes you can print money to account for all that you mentioned - but who does that really benefit? It doesn't benefit the needy. It only devalues what little money they have.
