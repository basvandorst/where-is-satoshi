Accumulate and sometimes sell for profits. There’s nothing bad in occasional sell.

Not really. Lot of people heard about crypto but they have no idea how and where to start. Exchanges can look scary and in the store you have a human touch. 
Users who are into crypto will use binance, bitstamp etc... It’s good place to sell if you want instant cash in your pocket.

Here’s the website 
You can buy/sell various crypto for cash online and offline in the store. They also teach people how crypto works, how to setup wallets etc..
Only thing you can buy apart from crypto is hardware wallet. No tshirts and mugs.
