Or you could write a check.

I don't think you understand how bitcoins work. The thing that makes them work is the public ledger, also known as the block chain. Without the Internet there is no block chain. And without the block chain, there are no bitcoins.

Maybe the "norm" is $200.

Speculation is not "investment".

If it floods, gold will be there. Fire, gold survives. Internet goes down, gold is still valuable. And if you have enough gold to etch with bitcoin data, you won't need the bitcoin data because you have the gold. If you die unexpectedly without telling someone your password, the gold will still be in the last place you put it for an heir to find. The bitcoins will be lost forever. Gold is perfect for storing value. Bitcoins are only beneficial for Internet transactions, not as a store of wealth.

China banning it for normal use (as a payment system) means less people using it. That's why the price went down.

Gold can survive floods, hard drive crashes and bad memory. The same can't be said of bitcoins.

No, bitcoin is better off flowing freely and being used for transactions. That's the true worth of bitcoin. If you just wanted to buy and hold you could get gold.

Gold (the actual metal) has fewer negatives for just holding than bitcoin. It can survive the elements and technology mishaps. You don't need electricity for gold. You can lose bitcoins to a computer virus or hackers unless they are "offline". In the comparison of offline storage, gold is far more survivable.

Only if you want to spend it. For buy and hold, gold does a far better job of keeping itself safe.

Where did I say certificates? I did not say certificates. Your encrypted bitcoins will die with you. Gold lasts forever.

You said "Shouldn't the value continue increasing as more people use it". My answer is fewer people are using it.
Also, value and scarcity are not the same thing. A "currency" that nobody accepts is not valuable just because it's rare. Value depends on supply and demand. 
A demand spike from China made the price go up (and this effect was multiplied by speculators and publicity). Now that demand from China is reduced, the price goes down (again, compounded by speculators trying to leave the market). 
There really won't be a "normal" price while there is so much volatility. When people stop thinking "I should own bitcoins because they always go up" and start thinking of it as just another currency used to buy and sell goods then you can start talking about a "normal" price.
