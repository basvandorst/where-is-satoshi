I've had a 22 BTC transfer stuck in an outgoing 'Pending' state on bitfloor since April 27. I've had no response from the Support email.
I'm open to get involved in any organization that can help with this process. Thanks Audenx

I tried withdrawing my BTC from bitfloor to another account and the transaction is stuck in 'pending' for 24 hours now. I was told that the bitfloor closer should only effect USD fund transfers. Is anyone else having problems? Super dodgy.

Nope: All my bitcoins are still frozen in their app. I'm raging.

I have 21btc stuck in bitfloor. Spoke to OMG about it. Super pissed. 
I believe in bitcoin which is why i bought but so far Ive only everienced 100% losses.

The btc's were wholely mine. They should be transferable regardless of weekends. I'm pretty sure this is a fundamental principle of bit coins. 
I can't think of a reason for them to stall the transfer other than to freeze all assets under their control to cover their own asses. 
I'm open to alternative theories.

Its been almost two months. No response. No new posts. Can I get an upvote for those who think they've run away with everyone's money?

Hey there. I'm involved with the 'list' now managed by OMGnohedidint.
You mentioned at some point that you had contact with several people at bitfloor directly? Have you shared those contacts with OMG?
