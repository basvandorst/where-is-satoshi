What Minmus is? 
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:10:53
Yeah, you got it right.

Bitcoin is just cash with predetermined supply. Corporation can plan years ahead because they know will not be oversupply of Bitcoin. That will stabilize the economy and anticipated growth.

Stupid question, bro. Gold was there for ages and our awesome digital magic money was invented less then in a ten years.
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:12:06
Scams! Scams are everywhere! 
@_date: 2014-05-12 09:22:58
So you only can use btc at credit card terminals if its one of their colored coins, rendering the rest of the coins worthless. Am I right? 
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:21:09
Doesn't seem like full POS, but still lots of respect for this homemade giant.
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:10:12
Looks like Mike Hearn isn' a technically-smart guy
@_date: 2014-04-06 22:07:33
This is a perfect place in case they cook good =) 
I wanna try it and if the cuisine there is pretty nice I would go there to eat more often 
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:12:31
Bitcoins? Into mainstream? Don't make me laugh
@_date: 2014-08-30 16:33:52
Well said  remotemass why stress yourself over something you kick against or reject its acceptance.
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:15:49
And also the heaviest

I like what TEDx was created for but sometimes you can meet with a shittiest bullshit ever there
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:14:14
Probably when all this dollar-oriented system will collapse and come to the end?
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:15:02
Who are you? Neil Armstrong?
@_date: 2014-09-21 19:51:10

@_date: 2014-05-04 19:58:25
fuck slow internet! pretty sure the video is really interesting
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:17:06
Sure! Why not? Your idea aobut .001 BTC is pretty good
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:26:36
How geniously this is? 
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:17:22
I'm pretty sure that correct answer is "no"
@_date: 2014-09-14 21:57:09
Lol of course they are currently unlikely to purchase or use bitcoin. I'm sure people would have said the same thing about using the internet a few years after it was invented. Take this poll in a few years and we'll see the difference.
@_date: 2014-08-25 13:14:38
Not understanding why folks can't figure out that technology has to have a starting point... this is the equivalent of 1981 for the IBM PC model 5150 running DOS 1.0... think it might get better?
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:13:56

Check out how these guys do it.  (trustless) 
@_date: 2014-09-21 20:29:00
 I think there's currently an imbalance and new easy ways to acquire Bitcoin should probably be a good thing.
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:15:14
Me too
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:14:51
Haha. Pluto is also an amazing dog name
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:13:24
Haters gonna hate. Don't worry about them
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:33:20
Scams are paying other scams for doing their "scammy" job. Shit! Bitcoin community should do something with it
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:21:55
I need to go to the local shop and buy one
@_date: 2014-04-06 21:53:32
Me too! It's become so inconvenient ! I wish the situation will change soon
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:15:46
You are an amazing guy
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:15:24
Why? Can you explain please?
@_date: 2014-05-04 19:10:58
I'm ineterested how many open ATM currently in the world?
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:31:19
I want to believe that space is not full of void. I want to believe that we just don't now how to feel another stuff
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:25:45
How could their censors allow such conference? Or they're trying to fight with dollar by all means?
@_date: 2014-05-12 09:31:34
your views are too pessimistic. Don't you think so?
@_date: 2014-04-06 22:21:18
Nice to see that you are with us! I am pretty sure you 've made right decision as Bitcoin haa the power to solve losts of problems and haven't current fiat's dissadantages, but it has its own disadvantages as it is still knew to current monetary system 
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:25:38
I also would like to add $1 for subtitles 
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:30:55
BTC-e is shady? wow kinda of surprise - what make you think so? 
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:27:42
Do not touch the blockchain! Bitcoin doesn't need it!
@_date: 2014-09-21 19:51:25
Nice! Really is good to see CNN mention bitcoin and in a good way as well. It's what we need to help bitcoin along to be honest and any good publicity is always great.
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:14:19
I'm about to stop thinking that WSJ is a good stuff to read
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:17:42
Indeed it would be a good way to solve the problem! Why not to make such subforum where newbies can ask question if they have them? 
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:14:29
Slovenian big company can be ten times smaller then american one
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:14:43

Satoshi Nakamoto would  be proud of you! Best wished btw 
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:27:13
+1. Some people on TEDx are so fucking stupid. 
But sometimes you can pick some very smart ideas from them
@_date: 2014-08-25 13:14:20
To be honest, i dont think so. He might "donate" some, but i dont hope he is greedy
