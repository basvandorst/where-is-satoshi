So... new paradigm?
Currencies default/collapse due to unsustainable debt. Yes the US debt has increased, so has the tax REVENUE which no one ever wants to talk about when they fear monger about the debt.   The US is not in danger of defaulting, otherwise demand for treasury bonds would dry up and interest rates would skyrocket as would inflation.

It's not an ATM.  It's a foreign currency exchange kiosk.  How much do they charge when you convert USD to EUR?

But increasing the blocksize now allows short term scaling so tx costs can remain cheap while second layer solutions are worked out.  Otherwise fees rise and growth slows because people stop using bitcoin due to high fees because LN doesn't work yet.  It's not like we have to go right from 15 tps to 1000 tps.  It's okay to scale as we go.  
I've seen core complain about segit2x implementation, but I've yet to see core propose an alternative more thoroughly tested, better implemented blocksize increase at their ideal date.  If the blocksize is not increased Nov 1 then when/how will it be increased?

I'm a fiat cash ATM operator and owner.  Shameless plug:  If this is a simple software upgrade this is indeed HUGE news.  I'd guess &gt;60% of private ATMs in the US are Hyosung machines.  The other major manufacturer being Genmega which I'm sure will roll out support soon if this is the case.

Not sure yet.  I've emailed my ISO(ATM processor) and will update when I know more.  I may just call Hyosung directly to inquire.
Edit: I called Hyosung tech support.  It is just a software update to enable.  I'm still waiting to hear from my processor to hear how the fees and compliance work.  Only buying btc is enabled, but ability to sell btc is planned in the future.

While I generally agree with this sentiment, Ethereum launching is a big deal.  It is definitely newsworthy here in r/bitcoin and should be allowed to be discussed.

Got the same e-mail.  Why has coinbase not sent out their own e-mail warning of the scam?

Cliffs: One bank's ATMs in downtown Athens ran out of cash until Monday.
This is a non story in my opinion.  ATMs run out of cash all the time.  This particular bank underestimated the customer demand for cash this week.  They will order more for next week.  It's really not a big deal.

I'm all for supporting him, but is this really all he's ever received?  If you check the balance over time it looks like this address was unfunded until April 4th.  Hasn't this site been around a lot longer than that?
