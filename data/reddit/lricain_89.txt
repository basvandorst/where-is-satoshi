For sure. It's funny, because I was engaging in a little conjecture last night and posited that China could hold something like 50% of the bitcoin "in circulation", so to speak, and make themselves money by cracking down on private mining operations, thus raising the price of the currency. And then I saw this. 
I'd love to have some sources, too, but good luck getting them from the Chinese government... Shame on Vice for their sloppy journalism. But don't get me started on that. Part of my reason for posting here was the hope that someone could verify or falsify.

Just came across this thread. Out of curiosity, did you go ahead? Have you gotten started?
[This]( might have an impact on your plans, perhaps making it more feasible?
"Removing a large portion of the network will also slow the number of new bitcoins mined, causing a shortage of supply that in turn will likely result in another surge in price ... The ban would also likely spike transactions times, leading to a rise in the fees paid to transfer bitcoin. "
Of course, this won't shorten the blockchain and therefore won't make bitcoin any easier to mine, but I can't help but think that ideas like ~~this~~ *yours* will become necessary for the survival of the currency if China moves forward on its plans.

Interesting. Any particular reason why you say Sweden? It looks like [India]( might be able to get in the game - if they're not already.

Ah, got it! Very cool. I remember something about this now. It is disappointing that journalists don't bother to check out this subreddit before putting out an article ;)

That's my elitism coming out. I personally feel that *true* journalism is dead, thus all "journalism" is sloppy. 
But, like I said, I was hoping that the redditors here that are more savvy in this field than me might be able to verify or falsify the claims.

Hmmm. According to the article, this is exactly how they were going to shut them down: not by an outright ban, but by doing things like this.
"In the documents, issued to the local offices of the internet-finance regulator, authorities were instructed to *force mining operations out of business using measures linked to electricity pricing, land use, tax and environmental protection*."

Yes, he edited in the explanation.
The following question might show my ignorance of how bitcoin works, no matter how many times I watch videos explaining it... but here goes: how would the difficulty adjust down? If miners leave, the blockchain's growth will slow but the chain itself doesn't shorten, right? So wouldn't we have a smaller number of miners who will still have to grind through a still ever- (albeit more slowly)-growing chain in order to verify a transaction?
I really do hope bitcoin *isn't* affected; I want to see it take over for fiat currencies (or some cryptocurrency, at least). I'm just trying to understand.
