I looked into Diaspora pretty early on, maybe time to revisit.

Just got one of those tweets from

Exciting! How/when do I get started? 
I'd suggest an email notification box under the "contact us" section so people who are interested can get updates.

I'll check it out! Thanks!

If you exhibit at San Diego or Emerald City next year, let me know and I'll come pick up something!

Helpful :)

I agree. Antonopoulos is passionate, positive, and thinks outside of himself. He genuinely wants to change the world for the better and has the ability to inspire others to the same.

I meant to write "drawed," it was funny at the time but maybe not a great title for the post.

Bro, we're not going to see a real jump in price until interest finally cracks the Ham Threshold (HT).

Just found this comment in another thread, may be the answer I was looking for.
"The training wheels are off, you are free to fall off the bike, ride off a cliff, crash into a wall, or hand your bike to a thief for "safe keeping."
I can appreciate that this is new technology and is exciting, but watching people crave stability while day trading, or using their bitcoins in ways they'd (seemingly) never use their fiat is very disconcerting.
If you want bitcoin to be a currency treat it like your currency. If you want it to stay a toy, keep treating it like a toy."

I hear you but it wasn't intended to equate Bitcoin to drones or Miley Cyrus, it's more of a reflection on the year 2013. The sensationalism, the misplaced focus, the resolving impact.

Any idea why Mycelium wants access to location and identity data?
@_date: 2014-08-01 05:05:47
It wasn't really significant in terms of sales, about $17 total. The second sale is the one I thought was most interesting, the guy was ready to pay with a card and then saw our sign and went for his Mycelium wallet instead.

They do have retail POS. In my opinion, it's a bit spendy ($49/month) for a small storefront but could work well for a larger operation or chain.
edit: I'm not sure how Coinbase or Bitpay integrate into the POS.

We use Shopify, they've been accepting bitcoin since last November.
Our gallery accepts them... if you need a calendar with bears on it:

If you think it's going up you should buy more at this price and reduce your cost basis. Right?

The economic incentive would be in the form of more users trading and more transaction fees.

What is a buttcoin? We aren't accepting those. No.

Ok, thanks everyone! I tried out Mycelium and it's just what I was looking for to tote around a few mBTC.
