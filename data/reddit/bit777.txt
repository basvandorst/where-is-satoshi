Depends on the games. If you are playing on Table games or Roulettes it is 0.01. Video Pokers and Scratch Cards have a built-in denomination in each game and it can go lower to 0.001 BTC per bet.

There is another Bulgarian site that has major traffic and started accepting Bitcoins recently. It is Grabo.bg. So in essence, Bulgarians are starting to adopt it :)

Alright, I see that we gave you a 100% deposit bonus, and I also see that you had a problem with insurance. We have already resolved that problem with the game. I don't find any requests from you asking for reimbursement though.

Bit777 customer support here. Just to clarify, in the rare occasions that a game would crash, the server still executes the game properly, so it doesn't cause an automatic loss for the player. As for the reimbursement, if you provide us with your username on the website, we can check and give an adequate answer to your claims. Thanks in advance.

Have you contacted us about your deuces wild problems? If you provide me with your username I will gladly take a look and help resolve your situation. Regarding withdrawals: all withdrawals on any gambling site require a minimum amount of blockchain confirmations for the deposits. On ours that is 6 confirmations. So yes, withdrawals are not instant. We verify the deposits of the player first before processing them.
