The Great Paradox of China? It's bad and it's no less bad just because it's intentional, if anything it's worse.

Does that include Cloud?

Now they're just fucking with us.

It's also so terribly buggy and unpolished it's basically unusable unfortunately. Gave it the benefit of doubt at the rough start but the patches are too far apart and the app remains unusable.

Still no shipping overseas? :(

Did you know that it's possible to look really stupid when you comment an article without reading it, especially when it's only a couple of sentences long? It's true, it can happen!


features, bug fixes, as well as other improvements.


are found, this release candidate will be tagged as 0.12.0.

I just assumed it was partly because most chat programs present messages as "nick: message", so if you only type ")" that sort of forms a smiley.

So to operate a LN node you host a hot wallet on a machine listening for connections from the Internet and tell everyone where it is? Sounds like a job for someone else...
(Yes, I’m actually asking, I don’t know how LN works.)

Interesting idea. Ultimately it could be a good thing as going back to CPU mining would do wonders for decentralization. Although probably not since it would only really be feasible if Bitcoin gets left behind and then maybe not able to recover. It makes sense if there’s a new PoW waiting just in case.

You still don't have to be *all* in on anything or willing to lose it *all*. No reason. Hedging and diversing to some extent is better advice.

No, you can just overweight crypto/bitcoin and still win, with lower risk.

They got goxed...

This graph would be more interesting with a line showing the USD value.

Storj will be open source, right? Can't someone just make a free fork without pre-mine when it's at 1.0?
@_date: 2017-04-06 17:39:43
It has been attempted already, ASIC resistance was the premise of Litecoin.

So what says that I will get anything back by lending?...

Speaking of P2Pool, is there any drawback to using it compared to centralized pools? If not I'm surprised it isn't used by everyone.

Use an ad blocker. It's as important if not more so than an antivirus. [uBlock]( is excellent.

There must be a better way than fighting over processing heavy number games to get Bitcoin using ASICS for that... It's ridiculous to even think about powering IOT since most devices will need to be small and battery powered. It would be a massive waste of effort and time.

There's no collaboration, hidden services has been a core feature of Tor for over a decade.
Edit: Really, just downvotes? Think I'm lying or do you just now like to hear it's not a special bitcoin feature? Here, I actually have sources.

Why did you save his job? I wouldn't want to have such a dangerous idiot around at my workplace.

How long have you been "far away"? Why don't you remote? You had your chance to make your bed, now sleep in it.
If you use it to solo-mine it won't work anymore. You're not fucked.

I think you would get a lot of funny looks. It would also be quite a lot of work for a new user just to get a dollar and there would probably be more people being very annoyed with rather than being amazed by BitCoin.
