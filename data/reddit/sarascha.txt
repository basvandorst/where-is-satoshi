Of course. Cryptocurrency is a playground for repeating financial fraud and scam that would otherwise be regulated. You guys will get your own ratings agency scandal like 2008 if people start taking ratings seriously.

Is that "store of value" meme still floating around?
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:38:51


It's not really defensible unless you're also okay with  banks/countries/rich-folks manipulating the market.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:28:10
Most crypto investors don't.
Most retail investors for that matter.

I don't know enough about Tether to say whether it was good or bad, but the timing seems really fucking strange
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:06:05


It doesn't need to be insider trading.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:48:35


They'll just manipulate the shit out of it to make a ton of money and there's nothing bitcoin can do about it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:03:55


Lol, this sub was super happy when Bitcoin hit $19k
I even remember some posts of people buying in at $19k.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:10:46
Your shit could also get stolen and the feds can't get it back.
but idk tho, maybe crypto has redeeming qualities somewhere
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:22:40
Talking about price points with a highly volatile asset is useless anyway.

That's the part I don't understand -- what actually constrains them from making new Tethers and buying bitcoins and then cashing out? An audit would answer that, but to my knowledge, there is no audit available for Tether the company. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:57:44


Oh boy, welcome to technical analysis.
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:19:02


Let's ignore it as a possible attempt at price manipulation, because he could easily could be buying a dip, because who needs regulation.
If this "expert" is attached to a major bank, they are not going to fear it. 
No major bank fears crypto. They'll use the shitload amount of cash they have and buy a stake in it and then control it, partially or completely -- and they'll control it openly or behind the scenes. Maybe even to the point of influencing developers or major services. 
And even if that stake goes up in smoke, it doesn't matter to them, because they have so much bloody money.
If you think bitcoin is making major financial players nervous because the little-blockchain-that-could is going to ruin all of their businesses and put all of them in the poor house and give international transactions back to the people, you're hopelessly naive. Don't be naive.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:40:52
Obvious discrediting shill post is obvious. Tether must be getting nervous about those (lack of) audits.


Passive income? Slow/easy job? These shouldn't be beyond your imagination.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:04:44


Don't touch anything that involves Tether. It's a sloppy, toxic shit.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:10:59
Probably using the government platform irresponsibly. That's not necessarily going to be the same as insider trading in a court of law (I don't know anything about law, much less Korean law)
A shadier side is that others in the government want to do stuff with crypto and are getting this guy out to avoid a bad reputation before they begin.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:48:21
This is exactly the correct stance to take. 
Bitcoin tech and related services are not user friendly, not the least of which because you must maintain opsec and secure practices at all times or risk becoming a target where your adversaries have near-zero risk for successfully stealing your bitcoins, and you have no regulatory recourse for recovering your investment. 
Main street investors would be better served by spending their time researching more well understood and regulated financial instruments (index funds) and then letting those investments sit for 20+ years
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:07:44
1. Join currency exchange
2. Leak insider information
3. Get fired
4. DON'T go to jail
5. ???
6. Profit!
Guys, this shady shit isn't going to stop. The penalties for being a bad actor within crypto space are not severe enough and there's too much money being made.
If manipulation, thefts, and market failures are not built into your risk profile, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:28:43
But you can't move them out if an exchange decides to halt trading or identity verification. If they make you wait, you may lose tens to hundreds off of the price you want to sell at because of the volatility.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:47:05
Don't get defensive now
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:04:29
If you don't want to lose your gains, you might as well sell now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:22:36
So just hodl forever until you die?

At least you can't get your degree stolen.
Not easily, anyway.

If you have a bunch of people good at manipulation on social media, and you just helped get Trump elected, the next logical step is to find something else to do. Cryptocurrency sounds like a good target.

The D in FUD stands for doubt, and everyone has every reason to doubt Coinbase's viability after service outages and an insider trading probe.
Services involving cryptocurrency inherit the volatility of cryptocurrency. Plus insider and technical compromise threats.
Once coinbase erodes the trust in its customers, it has nothing else to stand on. There's not a government with an independent investigation that can later come back and say it's fine.
The_Donald is also known to say "everything is fine; fake news; FUD FUD FUD".

There's a twitter thread that this post is about. There's a twitter post from Vitalik Buterin saying the same. I know you know who Vitalik Buterin is.
There's no false information because usability and user experience are mostly subjective. And of course, because this has 33% upvotes, most of disagrees, which is fine too.


Thanks, I couldn't find it initially. That certainly seems reasonable.


This is a discussion about both because both sides have had trouble. Just recently, Coinbase shut down Litecoin/Ethereum trading as well. 
This isn't limited to bitcoin. It might be a coinbase problem, but coinbase has become a major service provider which affects user experience.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:13:14
So about +900% gains at the low buyin?
Yeah, you should be extremely happy about that. Like, print the buy and sell confirmations out on paper and hang that on your wall kind of happy.

What's the user experience around getting your car fixed? You go to a reputable mechanic, he takes your car, gives you a bill, and you decide yes/no to spend your money. 
But using Bitcoin is currently like fixing the CAN bus every time you want to drive your car.

I found the dip:

I will certainly agree that bitcoin has been a much better investment than college education, partially because few people verify diplomas or even work history.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:06:05


Which means that the current culture and regulations make it really easy to become and succeed as a bad actor and get people to trust you with their bitcoins. You're right, it's silly to try to attack bitcoin and the blockchain itself (or even the computers and OS's or disks that hold wallets) when you can just set up that kind of business and get away with it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:46:48
Absolutely correct.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:43:16
Surely the regulators will step in to fix this manipu... oh wait
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:09:17
Then sell.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:11:48


Just buy all cryptocurrencies.
May as well invest in all hedge funds and company stock as well.
Just buy all houses too.
Repeat for each country on the planet.
You can't buy Mars though. Elon's already claimed that.
Edit: I'm for bitcoin, but bitcoin has big technical requirements for every day people to use. It's silly to point and laugh because someone didn't blindly buy in or didn't choose to take the steps to own bitcoin responsibly.

Can you beat most investors and hedge funds? You're probably good.
At this point, it's a competition to see how ridiculous it gets. Most people would be totally fine being up +50% with any other investment over the past *year*.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:30:53


Why would you invest and wait for someone else to tell you to sell? Don't do that.
The people buying cars/houses could have been holding for years for all we know.
The market should be robust enough to support short-term strategies.

I'm not sure how exchanges getting hacked is false information, and that affects everyone's perception of cryptocurrency. And affects the user experience.
And secondly, they don't say who is insuring them or the health of that insurance company. 
FDIC covers your fiat currency, not your crypto currency.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:52:11
I wonder how we can enforce that so that insider jobs don't happen.

Security is hard. There's a ton of companies doing things terribly. If you've seen the things I've seen, you wouldn't trust 100k to any exchange. None of them have any serious incentive to do things correctly.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:16:35


Right, I'm basing it on how often and how much companies have lost bitcoin already.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:48:40
I thought wide-spread adoption of Bitcoin was a goal?
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:31:44


It kinda is. You do realize getting more people on board with Bitcoin is better for Bitcoin, right? That means working on the user experience so people are more comfortable with transferring larger amounts of money through it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:50:15
They aren't there yet. They still have scaling issues due to high volume.
And that completely disregards many people on this subreddit who will tell you not to keep your money on exchanges due to previous breaches.

Bitcoin itself has no upcoming innovations to really change its value proposition. Lightning network is mostly a bug fix that put it on par with, more-or-less, Visa or Western Union.
The more immediate possibility is news from major investors deciding to do something new or different with it.
