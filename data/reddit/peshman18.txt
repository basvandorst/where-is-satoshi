people just dont understand the urgency needed in this world for bitcoin to go mainstream. People are suffering around the world without the means for banking but nobody wants to solve this problem. The technology is already hear but without ease of use this is going to die very soon. Where are the new ways to use bitcoin? we should have developed an easier way by now?

i was thinking the same thing. i don't think bitcoin is dead, well i hope not as this could have helped billions of non-banked individuals.

brought at all different prices from $800 to $350. Still holding from last November. Not going to sell up as I believe if we create the right tools for bitcoin then this is going to free humanity from economic slavery.

Cannot believe what Ive seen in the last 24hours. What the hell is going on? surely 24hours ago people wanted a shit ton of bitcoins and now they clearly dont want them anymore? where is the logic in what is happening? Can someone please explain the cause of this and how low will it now go people?

Yeah I hear you on the minimum wage front. Surely there's a limit to which tips can be obtained? I've worked at bars and received tips but I wouldn't bother declaring that. Taxing for the sake of taxing is criminal in my eyes so if the population believe tips are gifts rather than income then I feel it would make society a better/sharing place.

how do you break the short holdings and how high could it go if it beaks 450?

I do hope your right but until we have a secure way of storing bitcoins and using them on mobile devices we are going to struggle with people losing coins etc. We need a quick simple mobile device that can store bitcoins and use them freely. Once we have this there would be no reason for people to not use or accept bitcoins.

Your probably right, most people are ruthless but I do have a few people that really do appreciate  the help they have received. They may tip if there is an easy way to do this. If the environment changes to a tipping culture then it could pick up?

you don't see me going to my boss at the end of each day asking for 10-20% because I did a good job
Thats because you already get paid from your boss. The tips would come from users that work for other clients. Those users don't directly pay for the I.T service but if I saved their ass from a fuck up then surely they would like to thank us for that effort?
Its not about minimum wage its about creating a more giving society.

yep I'm thinking the same thing. These that have billions to waste are pumping and dumping like crazy to kill bitcoin. They want to put everyone off from investing. This is going to be interesting how it works out for them because if they win this war its going to be a major set back for world economic freedom.
