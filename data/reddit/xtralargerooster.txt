Whoa there, killer. If you think theft is okay then you have no moral ground to stand on no matter what the scenario.  Also you probably should realize that social security might keep people from starving, but it also was illegally tapped by that same government you are fond of empowering to steal from us during the bush administration.  You know what else feeds people? Food kitchens and meal services... You know how? Contributions from the middle class mostly... And guess what... You don't have to worry about them taking that money to go start a war in another country. 
The libertarian argument isnt whether social programs should exist, but more why do we believe that the government is the best way to solve it? Because historically the government isn't really so good at anything and can swing wildly every 4 years as the the last three presidencies have proven.  Give them more power than they need and the people lose control over everything.  Then your life is okay when your dude is in office and shit the rest of the time.  Solve it by working together outside of government and it remains the power of the people to determine their destiny and the government doesn't have the money to skip the asking permission step.

Go get em tiger. ��.  Yeah that's alot closer to libertarianism but there is one major difference that is important. Which is libertarians believe there are still key critical components that are best secured by government at a fundamental level.  These are key areas critical to free enterprise and public services.  The minarchismists don't completely share this ideal in quite the same fashion... For them it's more acceptance that it will likely remain the role of government, but for libertarians these are critical areas we would never want to fall out of the governments hands.
A good example of this is Libertarians are anti-private prisons no matter if they were a thousand times cheaper/more efficient, minarchismists may swing either way.

First, greatly appreciate the well written and thought out post.  I do understand your major points and your conclusions are very sound logically, however there are some gaps in a few concepts that I'd like to try to clarify if you are willing.
1. Social Security is not taxes, and taxes are not Social Security. I think this is generally clear but it is an important distinction as if we were talking about taxes I would be framing my position differently, bringing me to the next point...
2. Libertarians have no issues with taxes.  Not sure where this became popular and there are certainly our fair share of assholes running around telling everyone they are libertarian with out having ever read a goddamn thing.  Please excuse those assholes, they are everywhere.
 But quite the contrary, classic libertarianism fully supports taxes.  Libertarians want them to be fair, simple, and to support beneficial social investments.  The argument you have about Bridges and roads is actually akin to the various flavors of political anarchism... Of which libertarians are not.
3.  The focus mainly is that if we keep government contained to public interests only, we better maintain lower taxes, more liberty, and more privacy for everyone.  Roads, public services, education, military, police, hell even parks and recreation are all things that a libertarian would gladly pay taxes for, but that doesn't mean we want or need these regulations at a federal level. A libertarian generally prefers that the lowest level of government enacts these types of laws and taxes.  I mean social security is a fucking mess, do you really feel that this is the best solution to the problem?  You really shouldnt jump to the conclusion that just because a libertarian says social security is broken and we would be better off without that it means we don't believe that the problem it attempted to fix isn't real.  That's not what libertarianism is about at all.
4. Libertarians are pro government, but also pro transparency and pro efficiency.  The government is necessary, but that doesn't mean it's the correct answer to everything.  Or that everything has to be done at the federal level.  Why in the world can't we have a completely different solution to these issues that could work better and be less expensive than social security?  Libertarians don't see these issues as all or nothing, and we look to solve social issues outside of the government whenever possible. That's not always possible, so then we push for the most streamlined and least invasive solution we can attain.
Also wait what do you mean by if you can't contribute to society then you shouldn't be a part of it?  That seems really elitist.  Do you really think that poor and disparaged people shouldn't be allowed to be part of our society?

I have not a single issue in anything you wrote and appreciate your contribution to the discourse.  
It's for all of those reasons why we need more libertarian voices in the world.
Anarchism is the free for all shit fest that alot if people associate to libertarianism. The dog eat dog nonsense.
One of the most difficult concepts that non-libertarians struggle with is the idea that society and government are really two completely separate entities.  The funniest thing about alot of this conversation has been that Bitcoin is the perfect libertarian currency.  And many of the issues we all run into when discussing this with others is this idea  that somehow money not blessed off by the government is some how illegal or bad.  It's the same argument I hear when I'm told I have to have a permit and a county inspector to inspect a shed I'd want to build or the idea that somehow I must attain a license from the government to get married.
But social issues solved by government instead of society gradually destroys freedom, bloats government, and becomes an ingress for corruption and then tyranny.  Libertarians generally understand that some of this is inevitable and required, but it's the shit that isn't required or constitutional that has to fucking stop, especially when it's broken.
If you were born with 4 dice instead of 5 or 6 it might be significantly harder to throw a four of a kind. But your chances of getting lucky improve greatly if you have control over how often you get to throw the dice. Letting the government roll your dice for you at their speed doesn't really help you at all...

I don't think that is a stretch, banks have innovated new technologies into their transfer and payment solutions, just nothing this radical or that removed the need for the bank to remain in place.  But banks are desperately trying to integrate blockchain technology into their working models right now in order to ensure they will be able to compete with BTC.  
But this is where it's kinda tricky and also hilarious how poorly the banks have handled this.  Every attempt to integrate blockchain under the traditional system adds legitimacy to BTC the banks are actively trying to undermine. Black market this and worst than fiat that. All blatant lies.  Do you know what the black markets of the world use for 99% of their transactions?  Yeap, US dollars. 
So basically if that product would be created to exist as an official currency it would have to come from the federal reserve and by creating it they Federal reserve would be endorsing cryptocurrency. Of which BTC is the dominant force and is decentralized.  So why bother buying from the middleman when you could simple buy Bitcoin?

Precisely why liberty is so important and difficult to keep.

This is fair in every way... Many flavors of the anachronistic rainbow. To be honest I'm no where near scholarly enough to speak to the differences but do know enough to know that it does carry distinct variations. The anarchist movement gained popularity in the UK long before it broke American shores so Americans in general aren't as familiar with the intricacies which developed as the movement branched. I will say that my curiosity has been piqued and world love to learn more about it now though.
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:19:40
This nearly identical with the classic libertarianist values.  Give me a solid case that government is the correct solution and we will support the government collectively granted that they do not squander the money irresponsibly and remain transparent at all levels.
But the flip side of that is damn important.  The amount of money that one receives over the other is inconsequential no matter whether or not one is forced by government or volunteered by the people.  What matters is how effective the dollar is spent.
This is literally what is being asked in the source.  How in the hell does the government take in so much revenue but pay out less than a 1/3rd of a benefit to what would be payed out by a private investment with a modest portfolio performance.
Where in the world did the other 2/3rds of this go?
The argument isn't that social security should be dissolved, that's the conclusion most of the replies have jumped to.  His argument is why do we accept as a nation such a poor return on our investment when we were promised that this would support us in our elderly years?
The important thing isnt how much money is collected for charities or social welfare programs.  The important thing in this entire post is why the fuck are private institutions able to do so much more with so much less.
When he asks how is this not theft? It's not because he is supposing that the whole system is theft... He is saying that the 2/3rds we are missing in benefit has been stolen.  And honestly it probably fucking has been..  we know they broke the law when they dipped into the social security accounts to pay for the war on terror. And who knows how many ear marks and governmental inefficiencies are taking up the rest of OUR dollars.
There are alot of "libertarians" that have never read a book spouting ignorance under the banner of my party.  Don't believe these fuckers, that's not libertarian.
Keep in mind part of our fervor here is that we know that by the government claiming they would protect us in our older years it set forth several generations of Americans to rely on this system.  Feeling they would be taken care of several swaths of Americans had chose not to learn how to protect their retirements by learning how these systems worked.  They damn sure never taught it in the public schools.  Now future generations will receive far less than their fair share and risk the system collapsing because it was mismanaged and the American people are three generations behind where they may have been with understanding how their financial futures could be secured.  If the social security system does collapses it will absolutely hurt more people collectively than would have ever been hurt had this little experiment never occurred. That's the truth of this... We are stuck now protecting a system because it was sold with bigger promises than it could actually attain.
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:17:51
That's not the argument here. Don't forget that the vast majority of donations to social welfare programs not state ran are contributed by conservatives.  The truth is that all of us humans generally want to see others do better and limit suffering no matter what aisle you sit on.  The libertarian concern is not that the program shouldn't exist.  The concern is that there is no legal way to opt out should we feel we could manage our money better than the government can.  It's not really a question of whether or not we should take care of our elderly, disabled, disparaged. But whether or not the government should or would be the best way to do so. And the gross misconduct that has occurred with the management of social security should be of grave concern to everyone no matter if you believe the program should or should not exist.
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:09:31
Wait... People who want the freedom to choose what happens to the resources they earn are selfish...but people who want resources others have earned are not selfish?  And what does that make the people who would support empowering the government to steal those resources from others at risk of their life or liberty? Evil... That makes you an evil person.  Who cares what you think.
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:02:30
I actually think we have a great deal of common ground here.  Libertarianism has been mischaracterized alot as of late, by both those who claim to be libertarian and have never read a single thing as well as those who were generally apathetic to the party but are tired of dealing with the same fuckwits.
Classic libertarianism actually aligns beautifully with what you just described your own approach to be.
Social Security is not a tax, and the comments made in the source material are not claiming taxation is theft.  That is not an actual libertarian value at all no matter who claims to be a libertarian but spouts off anachronistic politics. Libertarians are generally happy to pay taxes to any governmental program that secures liberty or invests into public infrastructure, as long as the government is transparent from top to bottom and is executing it's fiduciary duties responsibly.  
I would normally not suggest this to others but I think you would find yourself to be a libertarian if you had any interest in learning more about it's actual core values.  I do fully understand how that might not be appealing right now with all the asshats who are identifying themselves with the party.  I'm not quite ready to abandon the moniker myself yet because of the hijackers, but I'd love to have more intellectuals in the party capable of speaking to what it actually is and healing some of the damage that's been done already.
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:44:48
The Federal Reserve Act gets tricky here... The US Government is prohibited from endorsing or creating a competing currency. There is jurisprudence to be forged here if the definition of currency is to be extended to include cryptocurrency which is currently recognized as a commodity.  Allowing Facebook to proceed with Libra is a direct conflict of interest with the Federal Reserve who will likely continue to misstep at the expense of the American people.  Reclassifying cryptocurrency to be considered a currency changes tax law and applies a whole different set of regulations which would have to be reworked as well.  Leaving it as a commodity prevents the federal reserve from suing the US but provides legal precedence for any corporation to continue developing and offering their own coin unless other regulations are put in place real quick.
Don't trust the people to choose the superior coin, consumers chose vhs over betamax, and they continue to choose Apple phones over Android.  They have proven they do not care about their own privacy or the quality of the tech they don't understand.  Consumers follow brand... BTC is and will need to continue to remain the dominant solution moving forward.  This congressional injunction just gives BTC more time to be adopted.
Tl;dr shits about to get a whole lot weird
@_date: 2019-07-10 08:12:40
Social Security is not a tax, and tax is not social security, you cannot opt out if you wish to work for an employer in the United States. You cannot opt out if you want to employ others in your own organization.  You cannot legally barter for goods, bartering from services will not feed your family and self. You are more likely to find a retailer who will accept Bitcoin than gold as gold is very difficult to conduct transactions with.
Libertarianism is pro government, I have no clue what you are confusing it with but please believe me when I tell you that nothing you have demonstrated you think you know about libertarianism just now is even close to what it is.  You have either ran into a bunch of assholes that believed themselves to be libertarian... Or have jumped to some seriously broke conclusions.
In fact what you describe is more akin to anarchism.  
I'm a huge supporter of NASA and was deeply troubled when their budgets were slashed.  Investments into technologies that the people own and cannot be patented by some corporation benefits us all.
Libertarians have issues with social security because it's a broken system that the government is abusing illegally and cannot seemingly be held accountable for.
Part of the problem here is the mindset you have and shared by others who are terribly dishonest with your approach to rhetoric and discourse.  " Oh he hates social security so he must want people to starve." Yes clearly you figured it out... No possible way we could ever prevent starvation with out the one and only social security program... Everyone knows it's impossible to create a separate program that doesn't have such a ridiculously shit performance record and that have been subject to serious abuse by the government.  
I mean are you really serious right now?

If you trade LTC for BTC, it is not the same as trading LTC for US Dollars and then using those dollars to buy BTC.  It may or may not be a taxable event at the moment. When in doubt it is better to declare than get hit with a felony charge for tax evasion though.  You may wish to talk with a tax professional when you file to be sure you are good. Just make sure you have a record of the time and date and the trading market value of each currency at the time you converted.  This is all tricky and no one really knows what to do until the IRS finally gives us more info.
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:37:48
I understand, no worries.  Honestly I hope you maybe take time to read some about libertarianism. It's not perfect but it certainly isn't the shitfest you made it out to be in your post.  I don't want you to convert, but maybe find some semblance of respect for others who disagree with you.   You may think libertarians don't understand how the world works but I can tell you that through my experience being homeless and the two wars I fought in paid for in part by the social security system the government illegally tapped into, the four countries and 7 states I've lived in and the dozen or so other countries I've travelled to, that no matter how different we as humans believe we are from each other, we all have essentially the same desire in life.  To live with as little physical pain as possible, to watch our kids grow up, to spend time with our families and friends sharing experiences, and to fuck our brains out.  Beyond that we are all trying to solve the stupid ape problems we have invented through society in different ways.  
But like I said, you don't have to respect me or anyone. I get it, I don't see the world as widely as you do.

Yeah no shit... Free market enterprise requires regulation and upkeep to protect... actual Libertarians recognize and support the need for government to help manage and intervene where needed, but are not keen on letting the government stick around too closely when they are not.
