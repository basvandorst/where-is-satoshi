Looks like some funds went to Bitstamp? 
Please retweet:

but the employees  'Mike and Ferdous are now in charge of the cleanup – and attempting to follow the trail of a 3700BTC transaction from MintPal' so unlikely it's a hot wallet i think

Because if noone kept coins in buy/sell orders on the exchanges, there would be no liquidity and no one could buy and sell coins.
It's a common myth that you 'shouldn't keep coins on an exchange', most coins have 5%-20% of their supply on exchanges.  If they didn't they wouldn't be traded and thus have no value.
Of course it means as a trader you have to take the risk, you just have to try to minimize it.  And apparently keep a very close eye on each exchange's background and activities and try to spot when things are going bad.
Which is one of the reasons why we need usable decentralized crypto exchanges...

Go do some work on Monero then instead of coming to DRK threads!!! ;)
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:09:38
that fact that the Monero dev took the trouble to come here and post the usual BS, along with the Trolleroettes, I think shows where they are really coming from.  If of course the 1000 'concern troll' posts in the last 3 weeks about Scamero in the DRK thread weren't enough.  When your whole coin is built on the shadow of DRK like Trollero was, now DRK is making it's Dash to takon Bitcoin, this is the only option they have to prevent The Big Dumpero ;)

it's amazing Trollero managed to get free PR by trolling the DRK/Dash rise.  If you remember after DRK started rising in Apr 14, loads of clones started popping up, Monero is one of the last standing due to the huge organized troll capability. But because DRK was closed-source, they had to use stock crypto-note anonymity which can be reversed on the bag of a fag packet whilst sitting on the toilet, but people still buy lol.  Half the Scamero community are on the DRK/Dash thread all day, and even the DEV! comes here to try to troll. LOLOLOLOL ;)
Note to trollero owners: right now is the best exit opportunity you are going to get, suggest you buy DRK before it's too late (and that's clearly what Icebreaker and friends are planning...)

Thanks for the interview! one of the most interesting on LTB for a while, not heard E.D. speak before.
@_date: 2015-03-24 15:43:26
nope, never heard of him.
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:46:14
Yes you are.  Everyone in crypto knows what a premine is. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:27:22
'basically was before the public launch'
lol - good luck with Trollero ;)
@_date: 2015-03-22 16:04:08
which were mined publically by BCT users and then likely sold on exchanges because they had 0 value at the time. unless you have any other info?
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:39:01
no you are a Trollero troll who is trying to say the DRK was premined and invoking 'symantics' - drk was public launch, so go jump off a troll bridge :)
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:28:34
such troll, there are no semantics
Premine = coins mined before publication
DRK = 0 coins mined before publication
'oh the semantics!!!'
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:15:32
wow - you don't even know what a premine is?  It means before the public launch. lol

It's relevant now to Bitcoin because of the current privacy issues in the media like the ongoing sybil attack by 5% of the Bitcoin network or the current fungibility crisis which is on-topic due to the Evolution market scam last week.  Using the Bitcoin code, DRK is example of how these issues can be solved.  Maybe Bitcoin could implement some of the features, learn from what DRK is doing, etc - So obviously it's relevant
