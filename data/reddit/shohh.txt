Anyone familiar with bitcoin, reading this; will notice the monumental flaw and impossibility in this passage:
"While governments can’t control cryptocurrencies directly, why shouldn’t we expect cryptocurrencies to face the same fate as what started happening to numbered Swiss bank accounts (whose secrecy remain legally enforced by Swiss law)? All local governments had to do was make it illegal to hide, and thus force law-abiding citizens to become criminals if they fail to disclose such accounts. We should expect similar anti-money laundering hygiene and taxation among the cryptocurrencies. The more electronic security layers inherent in a cryptocurrency’s perceived value, the more vulnerable its price is to such an eventual decree."

thanks for your input

Yo! Check back on this point AFTER segwit has been activated (one week?), it might not be as acute as it seems

thanks! finally one to see through my irony! Of course while pretending to be a wise Englishman in my comment,  I can not help to realise that the US dollar have lost 10% of value to almost every currency in the world. So why do we keep measuring the BTC to USD? it should be the other way around really

Seems like you are echoing what most people say about bitcoin these days..

holycow! I can not believe it! (except that I don't believe it)
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:32:25
haha close enough! Anyway .. USD is only interesting for US citizens I think... Not me

ok then, that it. Life is too short to mingle with dishonesty.
The human condition and money business... in this business almost everybody get corrupted... it seems inevitable

I really hope no one is able to centralise bitcoin power.. If they do it will really be the end.

He is quite misinformed, but that is not a bad thing, it means the masses still have not quite grasped the essence.
I actually have a 100 trillion dollar bill from Zimbabwe (bought it for a dollar as a souvenir). This has all the quality he describes as "real" currency but holds no value.
I can print my bitcoins or satoshi and put them in my drawer (which he seems to like) and they actually have better backing than most currency.
Currency today is all about trust. By the way USD has lost its trust and value to almost every other currency the last 6 months. Including to bitcoin.

My god this headline lacks explaining..... I have several bitcoins in copay, what is the problem with that, and why do you recommend me changing wallet?
