Do you have any recent experience with these guys?  We haven't added them to our cashback comparison tools because we read multiple reports of significantly delayed transactions.
@_date: 2014-12-16 01:16:36
is there a video available for this?

I would expect an exemption for the banks, wouldn't you?
@_date: 2014-08-31 00:38:57
damn. we need to figure out a way to get it to update faster.  it was 2% yesterday.
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:04:37
I'll do my best.  No one is paying a 15% fee to buy bitcoin.  The GC companies are paying a few extra percent during the promotional period to get more users (consider it advertising cost).  They are hoping for repeat customers.  The cashback companies get money from merchants for creating sales (affiliate marketing).  Throw in coupons and you can get well over 15% off.  Here at bitspender, we try to tie it all together for bitcoiners to get the best deals.

We just posted up our new DEALS page! We will post deals often and only include deals on items with decent reviews. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:00:54
Thanks for this Vinny.  I will figure out how to display this on our site.  When does this expire? EDIT: tonight at 11:59pm PT
@_date: 2014-12-01 17:16:14
Have you ever had any issues with CardFlip?  We haven't found great reviews, so we haven't added them to our site.
@_date: 2014-12-23 20:52:47
You're not going to believe this, but they increased the GC to $40.00. There have been many xb1 deals since BF, but this is by far the best, and it's only available if you use bitcoin. 12 months of Xbox Live Gold is $60, Assassin's Creed Unity list price is $60, and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag list price is $30.
@_date: 2014-12-18 17:27:46
How long ago was that?  Everytime I post anything about my site, someone shows up to try to promote purse, but they get thumbed down almost immediately.  Sounds more and more like when everyone was saying to stay away from mt gox.

No problem!

I added Gyft's surprise promo.  Now you can get up to 17.1% off at Amazon.  This applies to items sold by Amazon.  When you buy a $1,000 gift card, you get 5% off plus $50 extra cash back.  That comes to 10% off.  If you are purchasing less than $1,000, you can get 7% by clicking the + drop down on the amazon row (  You can then get another 4% for toys sold by amazon or 8% for kids' &amp; baby fashion/women's fashion/men's fashion/musical instruments/sport &amp; outdoor items sold by Amazon.
@_date: 2014-12-27 13:50:13

there is little reason to not allow 0 confirmation transaction on small purchases.  however, if you are selling someone a car for bitcoin, i could understand waiting 10 minutes+ to hand over the keys.

Couldn't have said it better myself.  Can someone compare WeMedia to a US entity?  How big are they?

This is something we are working on over at  (well, the bitcoin part).
@_date: 2014-09-05 00:46:30
It applies to the categories, but amazon needs to be the seller.  The categories tend to change every 3-4 months.

This is primarily a US based service. However, we are looking into expanding into other markets if there is a demand for it.  
Currently, we have only had 1 person ask about UK and 3 about Canada.

You are correct, they haven't made it easy enough.  Try this: Log into your microsoft live account that is associated with the xbox account you use here:  click Payment options, click Microsoft account, and then click redeem bitcoins.

I believe it was a $5 donation for the signature.  The book was still $30.
@_date: 2014-12-24 03:32:15
If the site doesn't accept bitcoin directly (Amazon), they accept a GC that can be purchased with bitcoin. If you're on the deals page, look for where it says "Make this deal even hotter:" and you should see a Giftcard: Gyft/eGifter - (% discount w/bitcoin) under it.  This discount ranges from 3% - 10%. Click that link to purchase a GC to use on the deal.
You do not have to use bitcoin to get most of the deals on our deals page. However, you will usually get a better price if you do. Let me know if you need any further help.

Go to  click the mrr 5% on the amazon row, you should see the categories on that page (handbags, shoes, sports &amp; outdoor, watches, and 6% at amazon local).  amazon is one of the only stores that does the specific category crap...  here are some cheap shoes for you if they're still in stock for your size ($43.73 before the discounts): New Balance Men's M770 Running Shoe.  Mine was out.  You need to make sure amazon is the seller as well.
@_date: 2014-07-15 01:31:28
We changed it a bit. I hope it's OK now. Thanks for the feedback!

That is correct.  I have personally used those services for over 5 years.

If anyone does have an issue, we will do everything we can to resolve the problem.
@_date: 2014-11-28 16:01:39
Their site says you will receive it within 72 hours.

It does sound like that but we haven't received any reports supporting it (we have quite a few users using mrr).  Many of the cb sites are unclear about that and still provide cb on purchases processed with gift cards.  Most likely, it varies from store to store, but the CB sites want to protect themselves from angry consumers.  Keep in mind that 4.7% is on specific categories.  If you do have any issues getting your discount, please let us know so we can look into it and make any necessary changes to our site.  Heck, if I can find something I need in those categories, I will run a test and let you know how it goes.

Doesn't make much of a difference if you repurchase spent bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:03:53
if it were that serious, i'd hope they'd disconnect them on their own.
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:18:29
How does "it is far better to spend bitcoin and repurchase it" lead you to "if you have to rebuy a currency after every time you spend it, just so it doesn't die". The point I'm trying to make is that it's better to use your bitcoin in place of fiat (and rebuy) than it is to hold it. Does this not create more demand for bitcon? If you are transacting in bitcoin you are most likely helping bitcoin. I'm not asking bitcoin outsiders to do any of this, we are discussing bitcoin holders.
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:01:42
I'm only responding to the constant praise of bitcoin holders. Instead we should praise bitcoin supporters that spend btc whenever possible and rebuy. Anyway, I will try to answer your questions. Why would people do this? To support the bitcoin ecosystem. The more people use bitcoin, the more people will have to notice it. Forget about supporting the price. Are you so naive to think good technologies gain acceptance on their own? Do you have any clue what we are up against? My comment was addressing readers, but you seem to be talking about the general public. They don't even know what bitcoin is yet. To a bitcoin supporter, rebuying isn't difficult. For some purchases, all it takes is 1 or 2 clicks to rebuy. This will get even easier. Wallets will have inbuilt default options to rebuy after purchase. I love how some people here conveniently forget about the environment they live in when they discuss bitcoin.  As if it is some flaw that bitcoin needs people to support it to succeed.
@_date: 2015-03-27 02:12:28
@_date: 2015-03-09 14:12:54
Everyone writes about hoarding bitcoin. Instead of spending fiat, it is far better to spend bitcoin and repurchase it with your fiat. The more ways we use bitcoin, the more useful it becomes.
