Thank god memes don't decide the future of bitcoin, and the market and utility will.
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:35:35
People deserve to be made aware. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:39:03
Only BitcoinCash, but it will likely become Bitcoin at that point...so my answer is no. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:46:11
It's true. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:19:54
Market will determine where hashpower goes.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:11:50
What? Who wouldn't want money that's rightfully theirs?
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:18:48
It's 100% fact that there is a chance of that happening. Disagreeing means you don't understand the governance model. Bitcoin is not a democracy, it is not socialist. Bitcoin is capitalist. The market will decide the best ideas and implementations and the market will decide  which implementation represents bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:49:01
Yes, but no one is dumb enough to do that.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:06:24
You deserved it. Quit trolling. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:29:25
Oh the irony. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:51:45
A fork will happen 100%. Nothing to be worried about. Make sure you have your bitcoin in a wallet where you control the private keys before July 31st and you will be good. You can go about splitting the coins later as there may be more user friendly ways to do so at that time. Otherwise you can just import your private keys into a BitcoinCash wallet such as ElectrumBCC following the fork to split them up. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:29:19
Misinformation. It will indeed exist on August 1st. Anyone who has their BTC private keys will also have BitcoinCash(BCC).
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:18:23
At least the post wouldn't have been removed there. Hope you keep your BCC btw. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:22:51
Zencash is superior and doesn't unclude the ridiculous dev rewards. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:59:12
It's just shills trying to prop up his reputation. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:10:15
If miners reneg, then it will be 1:1 on reneging with Core form the HK agreement. You got what you asked for. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:51:30
I still wouldn't consider that free. If the price of BTC decreases due to BCC then you have actually lost value. The right to all tokens of all bitcoin forks were included in the initial price you paid for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:28:45
BCC will end up replacing BTC if it gets more hash power. Be sure to hold your BCC. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:47:33
Current market value of BCC is 1/5 of BTC. So you will have to offer better than that. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:46:27
Extremely risky move. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:20:49
"Free" money isn't quite a good way to put it. I would say your "rightful" money is more accurate. It's yours because you paid for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:56:19
Hashpower will be the judge of that, not some random crazy dude. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:34:03
Generally curious why everyone on this sub seems obsessed with account age. Does it invalidate my comment? Are you saying because I have a 2 day old account that market and utility *don't* determine the outcome of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:31:05
That's an incredibly risky gamble to take.
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:57:34
I gave you a rate. You are asking me about reading? 
Go look for yourself. If you can't do better than that you are just wasting my time and money. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:19:16
We will see. There's definitely committed hashrate. Also, nChain, who has supported the implementation, claims to have 20% of the hashrate power of bitcoin. 
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:28:26
Lol it's not though is the thing. This sub blows my mind.
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:16:25
Enjoy your altcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:22:23
We will see.
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:13:11
All I listed was facts and advice on protecting oneself from asset loss.
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:11:00
So if you don't claim your "free" BCC then you lose half your value....doesn't sound "free" to me. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:08:16
BCC has a chance to end up becoming de facto Bitcoin. Despite what anyone here tells you. Might not want to blindy believe everything you are told. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:41:40
That's how bitcoin works. The market decides the best implementation. Bitcoin is not a democracy. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:41:32
The Electrum BitcoinCash wallet should be releasing this week. After the fork you can use that to sweep your key. I recommend sweeping both BTC and BCC keys and moving each to their own separate address on each chain to make sure you don't leave one or both vulnerable. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:25:32
You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
