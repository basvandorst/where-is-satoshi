That's not how it works though. He took the result of a crazy year of growth and used that as the input for his model, of course the model spat out that there could be another crazy year of growth.
You might as well use last week's winning lottery numbers to predict this week's.

I quite enjoy these bitfinex shill accounts. They don't even try to hide themselves, they bitfinex just throw bitfinex bitfinex into any sentence.
Seriously, check this guy's post history. It's a work of bitfinex art.

It's not about rights. It's about the company paying the employee to do things. In this case one of the things they're now being paid to do is not owning bitcoin in their private lives.
Let's assume that some people who invest in cryptocurrencies are gambling. Not necessarily everyone, but some. The bank has a reasonable interest in whether or not their employees may be chasing losses in speculative crypto investments. The bank trusts its employees with access to large amounts of money after all.

Bitcoin isn't a ponzi scheme, it's a bubble.
In a ponzi scheme there is a mastermind in the middle planning to defraud everyone else. He promises that if you give him money today he will give you more money tomorrow by somehow using your money to make more money from air. In fact what he does is pays back the people who joined yesterday with the new money from people who join today. As long as more people join each day and the people already in can be convinced to reinvest he can give all of them big returns on paper while the money flows in. Then one day the mastermind takes all the money and runs away. It's fraud.
In a bubble there is no central figure running it or profiting from it. It's a result of consumer mania, some people make a lot of money, other people hear about the first people and buy in hoping to do the same. In a sufficiently irrational market it becomes rational to pay a lot of money for something that you have no use for and place no value on, as long as you believe that you can sell it later for more money. Very few people actually wanted beanie babies, for example. What people wanted was dollars, but they thought if they gave some of their dollars for a worthless beanie baby then later on they could trade the beanie baby for even more dollars. Each new wave of "investors" buy out the previous wave, giving the previous wave a profit, in the hope that the next wave will buy them out. Eventually there are no more waves and the whole thing collapses.
The Bitconnect folks were running a ponzi scheme, like Bernie Madoff was. Us Bitcoin folks are doing a bubble, like the regular working people who traded beanie babies back in the day.

He shouldn't be attempting to use this kind of analysis in this context at all.

The ledger is public dude. If the IRS wanted to audit him they'd just say "great, which wallet is yours?".

Yes. It's nothing to do with communism, quite the opposite, this is the height of Randian deregulation. In a completely free system all contracts that are negotiated between free parties are valid. If the employer wants to make avoiding certain investments a condition of employment then that is their prerogative unless government regulation intervenes to deny them that freedom.
It's pretty common for this kind of employer restriction where conflicts of interest may occur. For example accountants cannot have a financial interest in companies that they audit.

No, then it's using crypto *as cash* while avoiding using crypto as a speculative asset. ie using crypto exactly as you're meant to.
Bitcoin isn't meant to have a speculative upside, it's meant to facilitate payments. People like you are why it's not working so well.

This is the exact problem that futures are designed to solve.
If you're owed 2 btc on a certain future date then you simply take out a contract to sell those 2 btc on that date for the current market price.

The weird VeChain pushing in the middle of it made me feel pretty nervous about my own holdings. I'm not sure I want an altcoin being pumped by shitty medium articles.

Bitcoin is tangible. Get your resident IT bitch to go through the code and go "yep, looks like we're good here boys". No differently than you'd get your resident science bitch to check a pile of gold bars and go "yep, looks like this isn't just gold foil on chocolate".
