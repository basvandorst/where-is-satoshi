Set up an account with coinbase, circle, or Gemini (if it's available in your state). Being a noob I would recommend doing a lot more research before you invest a large amount. Buy a little first and get accustomed to how it works. If you are set on buying a large portion definitely make sure to read up on private key security. Unless you are trading regularly on exchanges or spending the bitcoin you will want to keep majority of your holdings offline.
@_date: 2016-04-24 21:31:36
If you are selling bitcoin back to fiat there will be tax obligations, but I was referring to getting more accustomed to how to send it between different addresses and understanding how to control your money. You'll probably want to get a mobile wallet. A lot of people use purse.io when they want to spend bitcoin. I would look at spending bitcoin on goods you are going to buy rather than trading back to fiat. Further develops the ecosystem and is more efficient for you yourself. A lot of people trade bitcoin back to fiat and then spend the fiat. No need to do that when you can just spend bitcoin. It will price it whatever your local currency is regardless.

I agree to an extent, but don't see how it applies to the point of crypto. Gift cards are generally always from gift exchanged from one party to another. I guess this could potentially occur with company coins, but I just don't see how they would retain their value. It would not be any new innovation over the already existing gift card networks.

Curious what kind of scenarios people are referring to when they say this. It will be fascinating when Bitcoin is largely accepted as a safe haven asset class. At what point in time do we reach that? Obviously it is still small in the grander scheme of things, but the system continues to be resilient and I think there are many people who would say it is very unlikely that it would lose all its value. The one scenario I could think of is if Satoshi just started liquidating all his holdings.

And gift cards are one of the most inefficient forms of money in existence. I hate receiving gift cards because it limits your liquidity and how you can transfer the value.

Yes, there are numerous ways you can look at averages on charts. You can use this site and click on the dropdown that says Overlay. There will be an option for SMA. You can put in the days for the average # of days. Just make sure that to look at the daily you have the 1D option chosen from the top left. There is a drop down next to where it says GDAX BTCUSD.

The 200 day moving average is an average of the price over the previous 200 days. For example, if Monday it was 1,000, Tuesday it was 1,500, and Wednesday it was $2,000. On Thursday, the 3 day average would be $1,500. (1k+1.5k+2k)/3. So the Mayer Multiple is the current price of bitcoin, divided by the current 200 day moving average. Moving averages essentially allow you to more effectively track trends because it will smooth out the daily volatility. The 200 day moving average is extremely prevalent for traders and investors to use for long term trends.

The reality is getting in early was essentially any time before this year and technically it is still early days in the grand scheme of things. Majority of people had heard of bitcoin before this year, but very few took it seriously and many openly mocked users. The people who are fighting jealously should really be feeling shame. They should swallow their pride and reflect their emotions internally. We’re all in this together.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:38:54
I would assume that would be under the efficient market hypothesis? Only problem is that in order for that to be the case you need liquidity and a large part of the world capital still cannot access Bitcoin given institutional constraints. Obviously that is starting to gradually change. You also have the fact that the average person still has no idea how bitcoin works. Many have no idea it’s simply divisible and 1 btc is not the smallest unit. At least some part of this years rise is new users educating themselves and them realizing that bitcoin or crypto in general serves a need. In order for that all be priced in, we must assume a larger part of the world would not decide to use the system with further analysis of the system.

How did you derive that statistic? I would say it’s a learning process. Plenty of people have come in to make money and sell for huge returns, only to watch it keep sky rocketing. The game theoretical is for people to contribute to the long term success as it’s in their self interest. That’s how it acts as a store of value, whether they knows it’s defined as a store of value or not.

That’s the big mistake the general public makes when they are looking at a chart that is clearly a “bubble.” The chart needs to be of log scale to show the actual growth of the network. It would follow a geometric distribution and not linear.

Considering Trace has been recommending Bitcoin since $0.25 to the larger Austrian Economics community I have to disagree. He wrote a book called "The Great Credit Contraction" that detailed how the world would shift towards the most liquid asset. At the same it was written he believed it would be gold, but after he discovered Bitcoin he changed his thesis. The dude has been around way before many of the current core developers even were. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:09:11
No his word shouldn't be treated as canonical, but those against lightning network always use Satoshis vision and his white paper as an argument. The debate on scaling has been going on for quite some time, but obviously major consensus is currently with the core road map. And to say this level of adoption was unimaginable is a little off basis. We still have very little adoption and Satoshi was building a system which he believed in time could hopefully act as the money of the internet. We’re still far away from that end goal.

Yes, of course. See the Neo matrix meme.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:22:12
You are absolutely correct and that is the beauty of the system. It’s in the long term interest of its users for it to succeed. Bitcoin and crypto will outcompete State currencies simply for the fact that it can liberate and benefit the individual.

No, it’s not a currency. It’s a protocol. People can use it as a currency, but that is not an absolute given each individual chooses how to use bitcoin independently of other users. It’s a giffen good in the sense of metcalfes law. As the network expands and the amount of users increase, the value of the system increases exponentially. This leads to an appreciation of value from the underlying asset. As the asset grows in value, in entices other people to join and enter the network. This can be seen all throughout this year, as new users come in due to the fact that Bitcoin continues to appreciate. It becomes more valuable to users as the value increases. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:58:46
It honestly depends on what you perceive to be Bitcoins long term outlook. If bitcoin becomes the sole money of the internet, it’s only now the beginning. If it airplanes gold as the store of value, it’s still only the beginning. If it becomes the global reserve unit of account, it’s only just the beginning. Honestly, the only way it’s not just the beginning is if you perceive it to be some fad that slowly dies off, or it just collapses altogether as everyone stops believing it has value.

Liquidity has increased substantially. Also note that a sale of 8000 BTC does not mean manipulation. There are so many traders out there playing the ST game and that is good for Bitcoin long term. After we had a good rise to the 450-465 range over the last week volume has not picked up.

It is not a compelling argument for people who have been in Bitcoin for awhile, but it is compelling to a random person who has watched the broadcast and has to question the narrative they'd heard everytime Bitcoin was mentioned. You mean other people are starting to use Bitcoin other than drug dealers and criminals? Maybe there is more to it then I thought. It sucks that it really shouldn't matter, but truth is majority of people hold beliefs because of the consensus of the majority and what the establishment deems as worthy.

I'm with you that it is a bit of a paradox to currently spend it, however apps like fold (Starbucks and Target) and purse have made it more practical to do so. I do all my shopping outside of groceries via Amazon so I started using purse.io and save around 25% each time. Have made maybe 23 purchases over 6 months. I rarely go to Starbucks, but have used Fold any time I have gone. They are both great if you are going to spend money regardless because you can save money, and then reinvest that savings back into bitcoin or something else you enjoy.

It really is a lose/lose for so many people and they won't really consider alternatives until substantially forced to. People will just hold cash in order to avoid negative interest rates, but that will also cause them to lose purchasing power via the easing and debasement of national currencies. I guess it's a better alternative than having money deducted from your account while easing is taking place at the same time. The only problem is I will assume the strategic moves banks and governments will take is capital controls where you can't freely move your money (E.g. Cyprus, Greece). Of course it will be sold as it's what is best for the country. We don't want another panic and depression on our hands. Like that's the problem...people wanting to freely control their money.

Check out loanboase.com as there are currently some developments of this type of activity. Bsave.io just launched its savings account which pays roughly 3%.

Can you imagine that in a year's time your $1 would be worth $0.122 in current purchasing power? All things being equal, Bitcoin would be a better store of value unless it dropped to a price below $46.95 (given current price of $385). I'm sure that the market will be flooded with USD and will be used as a medium of exchange, but you would think some people would hold/use bitcoin as an alternative to the dollar. Certainly no one will want the bolivare. Hopefully there is spreading awareness in Venezuela of Bitcoin, especially to help conduct any type of international business.

Here is a useful [link]( to view . It is more like Amazon credit than a "gift card" per say for many sellers on purse. Essentially people providing mechanical Turk services are contractors. Just like in the business world if I provide goods/services to a company and then invoice them, I have essentially provided my goods/services on credit and the business will pay me at a future date. This is what is occurring globally with Amazon and contractors, however because of banking regulations in certain countries Amazon can not pay them cash so they essentially grant the vendors/contractors credit (It sits on Amazon's balance sheet as a liability). Essentially these contractors can't use or don't want to use the credit to purchase Amazon services so they in exchange are willing to essentially sell their credit at a large discount in exchange for bitcoin. They then can use bitcoin for purchases elsewhere or can trade on an exchange/localbitcoins to convert back to their local currency. This has created a more efficient market for money and allows vendors to get access to a more liquid medium of exchange that they prefer. As more buyers register for purse.io and use the service the discounting will decrease as there will be a more competitive market, but at this time there is still not a huge user base of buyers.

I apologize for not being more articulate in the way I phrased that because I agree with what you are saying. What I meant was the people will pull cash out of their bank accounts because banks will pass the fees on the customers who have cash in their accounts. Hence what I meant by holding cash is that they would physically have it rather than in an account with a bank. I did not mean that people will not spend money due to deflation or falling prices. I assume that is the economic fallacy you are referring to.

That's the funny thing about all these posts. It is not a problem with Bitcoin, but a problem with trying to go from one system to the next. If this guy provided services or accepted Bitcoin for goods on purse.io or openbazaar this wouldn't be a problem. All these hoops that you have to jump through are due to how the current legacy system is setup. If you are trying to exchange fiat for btc expect the same process. Once you're in the ecosystem though, there is hardly any issues. Exchanging btc for alts is pretty seamless.

What was your reason for initially making the purchase? Has anything fundamentally changed? If not, there is really no reason to worry. If you truly believe that Bitcoin is revolutionary and will change the world, then it makes sense from a to store some of your wealth in it and have a long term mindset. You can't let emotion override reason. There are a lot of people on this subreddit and bitcoin who are more interested in turning a quick buck and selling their bitcoin back into fiat. There are also a lot of people like myself who truly believe that bitcoin (or something very similar, unlikely bitcoin is surpassed though) will be the world reserve currency eventually. This in large part due to its scarcity and that in the future a much larger portion of commerce will be done electronically and via the internet through the internet of things. The day to day fluctuations are just part of getting there. If you can't afford to lose 50% of the current value you hold then it may not be best to currently own bitcoin. However, if you can hold then the upside potential is just astronomical (think 5-15 year time frame). There is also the possibility of a black swan event where many of the world's countries have currency crises (think Venezula, but more rampant among other nations.) This would greatly increase demand for alternative means of money outside of their local currency. Gold has the history, but I think gold is doomed in many ways due to the fact that bitcoin is far superior. It can be easily sent anywhere in the world and almost instantly. You are also able to secure it quite easily and is much easier to store millions in bitcoin than say millions of USD worth of gold.

It's not really stock but there would've been a publicly traded exchange find. The Winklevos twins had planned on publicly listing 100,000 bitcoins to trade on the American exchange BATS. This would've allowed people to purchase Bitcoin in their retirement accounts and such through their brokerage firm. It really doesn't change too much in the Bitcoin world, it just doesn't allow it to be publicly listed on American exchanges for trade. Some big funds (billion dollars in management) have certain constraints in that they can only purchase companies or assets that are publicly listed on certain exchanges and that do a certain amount of volume daily. They currently can't purchase Bitcoin. It would've been great had it been listed as an ETF, but it's really not bad news with a rejection. Just not good news in the fact that some large funds in the current financial system can still not purchase Bitcoin.

So you think the current probability of Bitcoin reaching gold's market cap in the future is 2.8%, which would give it a current present value of $3,600 per coin? What was the time frame used to reach that market cap? Was the supply change factored into that?

Lot of people sold and are hoping to buy in lower. The price has actually recovered quite nicely so we'll see how it turns out. Lot of people expected the price to go much lower, but to be honest majority of Bitcoin users don't care about an ETF. We've been using Bitcoin forever and it doesn't need to be listed as a tradable asset within the current financial system.

In some sense yes, however the difference is how new money is created and brought into circulation. In the current system it is done through a central bank establishing what they believe the be the best interest rate and then banks can borrow money and lend out in the market. The money supply can essentially be controlled by a central entity and they can change their policy at any moment. Bitcoin money circulation is based on math and cryptography. New money is brought into existance by the miners would currently increase the supply by 25 bitcoin approxiamately every 10 minutes. This will in effect half roughly every 4 years (1 block 12.5 bitcoins starting around early July this year, etc.). This is the current protocol for money circulation and will continue until 2140. Since bitcoin is decentralized one entity can not suddenly change the supply of the money. It can be proposed by those who operate in the system, but unless a majority of the participants agree that it should be changed it will in fact not be done.

Here is a useful [link]( to view . It is more like Amazon credit than a "gift card" per say. Essentially people providing mechanical Turk services are contractors. Just like in the business world if I provide goods/services to a company and then invoice them, I have essentially provided my goods/services on credit and the business will pay me at a future date. This is what is occurring globally with Amazon and contractors, however because of banking regulations in certain countries Amazon can not pay them cash so they essentially grant the vendors/contractors credit (It sits on Amazon's balance sheet as a liability). Essentially these contractors can't use or don't want to use the credit to purchase Amazon services so they in exchange are willing to essentially sell their credit at a large discount in exchange for bitcoin. They then can use bitcoin for purchases elsewhere or can trade on an exchange/localbitcoins to convert back to their local currency. This has created a more efficient market for money and allows vendors to get access to a more liquid medium of exchange that they prefer. As more buyers register for purse.io and use the service the discounting will decrease as there will be a more competitive market, but at this time there is still not a huge user base of buyers.

This is exactly right. We had a nice increase in price the last 1-1.5 weeks and people are throwing the word bubble around like it ran up 100's if not 1000's of percent. Bubbles generally form over a long period of time as well. If you look at a 5 year chart you can barely see the recent rise in price, however you can clearly see the run up over $1,000 and just losing around 80% of it's value as you mentioned. That was clearly a bubble.

Well technically that argument can be applied to spending money on anything. There is always a cost of capital. If you have 1 btc currently valued at $4,000 and you spend it entirely, it is essentially the same as if you have $4,000 in fiat and spend it all. They both have the same opportunity cost, with the exception of any fees that may come from purchasing btc with the fiat money. There is literally no difference as both decisions you are consuming in exchange for monetary value. The only difference is the person spending $4,000 in fiat did not want to hold btc in the first place so they valued the $4,000 more than the 1 btc. This really depends on the risk aversion levels of individuals. I fully believe in bitcoin long term and will be spending it as well as holding it. I would rather spend it on consumption rather than ever exchanging it back to fiat and holding the fiat.

What you are stating is how thing are currently, not for how they will be. You forget there are at least two parties for every transaction. If the perception long term changes of fiat, why would anyone demand it as payment? It will take time yes, but that's the end goal. This is when you will see a huge paradigm shift known as hyperbitcoinization. When literally everyone wants bitcoin and no one wants fiat. You can't spend your fiat when no one wants it.

There are numerous cases of gold market rigging and there is no transparency in the vetting of asset to paper ratios. This project is to try to disintermediate current trusted parties and actually have a distributed ledger system that tracks/verifies the asset (gold). Will be interesting to see how it develops. I find it hilarious if all the gold bugs who have been bitching left and right about gold market manipulation and bitcoin being tulips, actually had a solution presented to their problems via a bitcoin mechanism. I'm sure they would still be in denial even when solutions were presented that allowed more efficient tracking of gold assets.

That's only partially true. If you are only defining value in monetary terms, Bitcoin would have never succeeded as it has to begin with.

There's also the possibility of present value models, where you may be losing money in the short term, but it pays off long term because of other variables.

I highly recommend you read "The Soverign Individual". Power and governments have essentially become rather decentralized. In order for bitcoin to be stopped you would really need majority of all governments in the world to collude together. There will always be an incentive for nation states to defect though because it is an opportunity to benefit their nation in the long run. This was seen in the early days of the internet when China tried to squash it rather than actually innovating on top of it. They had to catch up. You can see that they have taken an opposite approach to Bitcoin and are actually somewhat at the forefront. Can certain countries ban it? Yes. Will banning it be successful long term? No.

I don't think you understand how market cap works. Volume would be $1, but market cap is determined by supply times market price. One could see with such low volume that it probably isn't worth 100 million and that's why liquidity is such an important metric in determining an underlying assets valuation. Buyers and sellers make up a market price and that market price is combined with the float to determine overall valuation.

Triple entry bookeeping is a huge deal. We’ve always need a third party for attestation of accounting records and it is both inefficient and also still revolves around trust.

Correct. All I'm stating is that people who are looking at this and thinking that 70% is a real possibility because of bitcoin are kind of fooling themselves. It could maybe add 2-4% to your margins, which is a lot. With that though the volatility gives it foreign exchange risk which has to be taken into consideration.

Well it depends on how you define money and also what to expect from a form of money that completely comes from the free market. Your use of "nobody" is definitely a generalization because money is a language that communicates value amongst users. If nobody was using it, then bitcoin and other crypto would not hold any monetary value whatsoever.

Again, you are speaking in absolutes when you say nobody is using it as a medium of exchange, which again is only one aspect of money. There are many that use it for medium of exchange, but again that is also not what drives value. Sound money must always act as a store of value in order to retain its monetary value, and its velocity of money is relatively irrelevant. For example, currently the Venezuelan Bolivar has very high velocity and people look to exchange it for goods first as a medium of exchange as opposed to another form of money that will retain its purchasing power and not be eroded. Maybe to you Bitcoin serves no purpose as money, but that does not mean that it doesn't at all, or that it isn't serving as some form of money as it evolves.

People really need to think about what money is and how each of us go about making decisions with our money.

No. There is always an opportunity cost of capital. On that same day there were numerous individuals who also purchased a pizza using US dollars. That money could've been used in exchange for Bitcoin. All throughout Bitcoin's history any time you made a purchase with US Dollars, it could have been going towards Bitcoin. There was an opportunity cost with each decision you made. Does that stop you from acquiring the things that you want? It might actually, but it will really get you to question the general tradeoffs of what is in your present valued interest. Throughout most of history we have had floating interest rates that allowed us to determine the opportunity cost of our money. This is why market pricing is so important. It sends us signals of how capital should be allocated. Growing up my parents could put money in a saving account and actually get a yield and return on their money. Now the young generation are essentially losing purchasing power any time they put it in a savings account. Governments and central banks around the world have destroyed their money system by keeping interest rates at essentially zero to where individuals have little opportunity for actual yield. Bitcoin is changing the system by getting people to really think in terms of opportunity cost again. There is a real tradeoff between savings and consumption. In time as liquidity in the system arises and usage grows, we will see a pricing system in Bitcoin where a market interest rate is determined. This will allow individuals to more freely determine how they should effectively allocate their capital and come to a better conclusion as to how they should use their money: on savings, or on consumption. We are liberating money and in return, liberating the individual.

If you actually use his logic you would come to the conclusion that you should invest. The trend is clear that more people are starting to gain trust in crytpo and Bitcoin and general and expect it to have higher value in the future. Contrast this with the dollar and other fiat currencies whose trend is showing that more people are losing faith in them as well as the governments behind them. You want to make a decision based on future expectations, not of what people necessarily believe today. That's why when people say "oh, what can you actually buy with it, I don't see it at Walmart when I walk in". It's a shortsighted mentality because its based on the premise of 100% adoption through no timely process. Just as you mentioned an asset or currency coming from the free market can't just go from 0 to 100 trust overnight. It happens gradually, and those that prepare ahead of time are rewarded. That is aligned with the risk assessment that you pointed out here as well, that it makes perfect sense for a young person at 17 to allocate some capital towards it and familiarizing oneself with how it works.

Looks like this is for a business account with Coinbase which makes some sense depending on the situation. I do not believe that this applies to individuals.

This is really the most important question as he currently has possession of a large majority of the coins. We won't really know until time continues to play out. There is always the possibility that he died sadly and in that case they are probably lost. If he is however still alive I don't see why he wouldn't circulate them at some point. He wouldn't necessarily have to spend them all, but could send them to various charities, businesses, people, etc... Just make them available to the economy. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 04:06:33
I mean it does and it doesn't matter. It doesn't stop or hinder bitcoin growth and demand, but it does allow one to change what their perception may be of upside in future potential price and how large the current market is. If you think at some point the market cap will reach that of gold's at around $7 trillion dollars you would have a different price per coin given the actually supply. At 18,000,000 coins the price would be $388,888 per coin and at 15,000,000 coins the price would be $466,666 per coin. It is just interesting to think of what the actual current market cap is and not just the price of a coin. The market cap shows you the overall total size of the market. Hard to actually determine without the supply.

Here is a useful [link]( to view . It is more like Amazon credit than a "gift card" per say for many sellers on purse. Essentially people providing mechanical Turk services are contractors. Just like in the business world if I provide goods/services to a company and then invoice them, I have essentially provided my goods/services on credit and the business will pay me at a future date. This is what is occurring globally with Amazon and contractors, however because of banking regulations in certain countries Amazon can not pay them cash so they essentially grant the vendors/contractors credit (It sits on Amazon's balance sheet as a liability). Essentially these contractors can't use or don't want to use the credit to purchase Amazon services so they in exchange are willing to essentially sell their credit at a large discount in exchange for bitcoin. They then can use bitcoin for purchases elsewhere or can trade on an exchange/localbitcoins to convert back to their local currency. This has created a more efficient market for money and allows vendors to get access to a more liquid medium of exchange that they prefer. As more buyers register for purse.io and use the service the discounting will decrease as there will be a more competitive market, but at this time there is still not a huge user base of buyers.

So infrastructure is just going to dissipate overnight? I can see this being a problem if something like this is implemented and Bitcoin and other cryptos are nowhere near ready to scale, but if they are money will flow into them and it will be used as money. Luckily an alternative has been created before we got to the last stage of all this central banking shenanigans. The world is not going to suddenly end when the world transitions to the next monetary system. It will happen slowly and then it will build up and just take off. Hopefully the crypto infrastructure is ready sooner rather than later.

Agreed. It's hard to make assumptions like if coins haven't moved since 2011 that they are lost. I'm sure a good amount of them are, but there are definitely ones out there like you mentioned that are still accessible by people that believe in Bitcoin and have plans to use them in the future. Can't really accurately determine a percentage which in itself may be a good thing. The money is really decentralized in that case and only those that own those Bitcoins really know if they are lost. I guess you could do a crowd sourced survey on individuals who could account for the number they know that they lost, but still that would be based on honesty and all it would take is a few individuals to lie. Didn't know if there were any theories out there on this topic that have some merit.

That's not how scarcity works. If I have a pizza and cut it into 4 slices or 128 slices, the size of the pizza does not change. The divisibility component has no baring to how much exists (the scarcity portion). Divisibility allows for more efficient means to allocate the scare resource.

Valuation doesn't matters. The pizza analogy was used as a metric to demonstrate divisibility and how that does not affect the overall size of the supply constraint. You have not increased the size of the pizza, just as you have not increased the 21M btc cap

The example I used was a metaphor that still applies. I had 1 pizza and then in both examples made it divisible to 1/4 a pizza and 1/128 pizza. The current supply constraint is 1 pizza. It is just numbers and doesn't just apply to physical attributes. If we can't increase the supply of 21M supply of btc then it's supply is constrained and is scarce. Adding a decimal place doesn't increase the supply it just makes it more efficiently divisible. If I have 1000 millibits and 1 btc, they are the same in value. I don't break the property of scarcity because 1000 is more than 1. They are different units of account. 1 btc is not equal to 1 mbtc. Just as $1 is not equal to 1 penny. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:43:26
Just don't worry about it. Your intuition is right like you're stating. This guy just doesn't get how there are a huge variety of exchanges that can take place. Bitcoin is peer to peer. So me and you can exchange like you said at a set price and no one knows. That would not effect market prices on exchanges because we've just transferred ownership between the two of us privately.

To be fair that's with everything we consume. There is always an opportunity cost of capital. Any time you purchase anything, it could be going to Bitcoin. I saw a cool post about how someone was going to give up smoking and start accumulating bitcoin. It's pretty awesome that there is a huge incentivize for people to start saving money rather than spending frivolously. Governments have destroyed their fiat currencies and there is literally zero interest on savings accounts.

All the arguments he uses to support gold, also applies to bitcoin which is why he loses so much credibility.

Feel free to show your charts of a time where it lost 90% of its value in a short period of time? That is not the chase. There has been swings of 50% within a two week or so period. I see what you are saying in terms of store of value on a small time frame, but I am referring to a long term store of value. Hard to really quantify given bitcoins short existence, but volatility over time has continually dropped which has been correlated with liquidity.

I’m just wondering where the implication that young people don’t understand that any differently than the past generation. Homes are the best example in regards to debt financing given they are static assets. Their value fluctuates regardless of the amount of capital you have invested so it is generally best to not have equity tied up. This is especially true given that interest rates are so low and you can borrow at prices much lower than the opportunity cost of capital if you allocate it to assets that generate a cash flow. Anyone saying debt in and of itself is bad, doesn’t really understand money and finance to begin with and I agree there is a lot of that in here. The biggest problem with the current debt system is that it isn’t based on sound money and a central party controls and sets interest rates via monetary policy. This creates a moral hazard and noise in market prices that leads to the big booms and busts we see. This is one of the big differences between how the Austrian school of economics views the business cycle as opposed to other schools like the Chicago school and the Keynesian school.

The point isn't that it's high risk. The personal finance and finance subreddits not only laughed at bitcoin for years, they outright called us all stupid.

Although I do agree there isn't much merit to this post it does bring awareness to the community that there is discussion on a hugely subscribed subreddit. When the article was first posted there was a lot of people shiting on Bitcoin, and then it just started getting flooded with thought out counterarguments and great discussion came thereafter. I'm sure some saw this posted here and went to give feedback and educate those that may not fully understand Bitcoin. I assure you that post has led to others coming to check out the Bitcoin subreddit. Lot of visibility on Futurology.

That's based on the premise it will actually be tax free or no haircut in the future. I think many Americans think there is a 0% chance of bailins of their funds like what happened in Greece and Cyprus.

Agreed. If you are dropping $15k on btc, it would be a good idea to purchase the Trezor for $99 and have the safety of controlling your own keys. I would recommend this user watch tutorials and spend a few hours researching proper storage safety. It's good that people are skeptical of leaving funds on an exchange, but I fear a lot of newbies will incorrectly do something in the process of moving the funds and actually put themselves at more risk.

I agree it would be pretty much impossible. The one situation I can think of is that the original owner died. Kind of depressing, but it's not out of the realm that an early miner died and their heirs could pitch or sell the hardware. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:43:50
Yes, Trezor imo is the best hardware wallet out there. Ledger hardware wallets are amazing too and are cheaper than the trezor, but if you have $15k in btc, a $99 spend on a trezor is probably not a big deal.

No news. We went from $28B market cap, to $44B market cap in a week and went over 100% in a month, so a pullback was somewhat evident. Lot of people taking profits. It should settle down at some point, however there has been a lot of volatility recently so that could continue. Time will tell
@_date: 2016-05-29 22:22:28
Pretty simple, people are willing to pay more to obtain it. There doesn't have to be one reason, or you don't have to know why. For all we know a central banking could be placing orders to hold bitcoin along with their basket of other currencies.

Yeah, exactly. I think the average person that puts money to retirement accounts has not considered what has happened and the situation the US is in. As Bitcoin gains more attention, I'm sure more people will put more thought to it. Regardless of what everyone's take is on it being a currency will definitely continue to work long term as a store of value given its scarcity principles.

It has nothing to do with moon kids. A house is a static asset. It's a terrible use of capital. I wouldn't say he shouldn't have sold all his btc, but allocating all that cash to purchase the home is not a good use of capital. This is also given interest rates are still ridiculously low.

Well I agree with the way you are interpreting it, but the way it is generally referenced in regards to selling in forums is in regards to selling back to fiat. The way you are interpreting it, I would personally believe it would be people referencing when are you going to spend it. Obviously holding it means neither of those, but for most who have been in this space for quite some time, the goal is to not sell it back for more fiat, it's to be able to purchase anything we want with it.

Putting lmao at the end of that question makes it seem like you think this is impossible. If that is the case you really don't fully grasp the current situation of the global system. Growth is starting to stall and numerous economic indicators are not good. Wall Street has been harping that interest rates will rise all year and we are now in October with exactly no hikes. Interest rates can not normalize again given the global debt levels that have been taken on by governments. You'd have to tax citizens at exorbitant amounts and that is unlikely to happen, so the alternative is to debase the currencies. Negative interest rates and helicopter money are the last ammo that central bankers have until the world transitions to a new monetary policy that is not controlled by central institutions. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:33:03
It is a subjective manner as it deals with risk aversion. I didn't saying owning a house was bad, it's just not a good use of capital from a finance standpoint. With a mortgage you still own the property, but their is a lien on your property from the creditors. The problem people run into is they allocate their money to consumption goods rather than actual asset that will generate cash flow or appreciate in value. Those types of people should not continually lever up. For an individual like myself though, the objective is to continually expand my net worth. In that case I am not going to allocate $75k in capital to a static asset when I can borrow the funds with only a cost of capital at roughly 4%, and can put my money to better use allocating to other assets that will generate a cash flow and whose return would exceed the alternative of being tied up in my house. The value of the house fluctuates regardless of my initial capital invested in the home.
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:58:14
You are absolutely right. Savy investors allocate capital to assets that appreciate or generate positive cash flows. A car is anything, but that. It's a depreciating asset. A new car can be nice to have, but if you want to continually build your wealth, it's best to not put a lot of your extra cash to something that will hold you back from that goal.

@_date: 2017-07-03 16:02:34
Oh I definitely agree in the short run, but in time people and entrepreneurs find solution work arounds that allow individuals freedom of choice. Bitcoin is so important because once capital is completely mobile and can't be contained, the world will have to be governed completely different. The State Powers that try to stifle its usage will be left behind as other States embrace it as an opportunity for capital investment and local innovation. It's essentially what was laid out in the Sovereign Individual in that, in time power will continue to be more decentralized and move to the individual. It is Evolutionary. The internet has allowed information to flow more efficiently and essentially at zero cost to the consumer. Not only is crypto currency in the early stages, in reality the internet is still in its infancy and it is continually evolving as well. It's only been 29 years since it was introduced.

Yeah, it's nice seeing some posts about being in the green now after being down the last 2 years. It'll be nice if the trend continues up as it'll be further evidence that regardless of the volatility in the short term the long term trend of bitcoin is up and to the right. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:31:39
I agree with what you are saying, but the State will have to adapt and mandate taxation in other ways. You cannot stop Bitcoin. I was responding that there is little incentive to outright ban it, and in states with strong property rights it would be essentially impossible anyway.

This is only a problem if people sell bitcoin back to fiat before making the purchase of goods or services. What people need to do to further develop the system is make these type of purchases via bitcoin. It serves no purpose going back to the old inefficient system. As the market of bitcoin grows and there is an appreciation of price it is important for people to use bitcoin as it was intended. It is nice that it can be its own asset class and share many properties with gold, but it is superior to gold because it can be more efficiently used as a medium of exchange anywhere in the world almost instantaneously.

@_date: 2017-07-03 17:12:10
It means that a lot of investors and entrepreneurs will be extremely pissed and innovation will move elsewhere in the world. Make no mistake, the NY Bitcoin license set a precedence to the rest of the States of what not to do. Majority of crypto innovation left and went elsewhere. If the US federal government did the same, the same reaction would happen except on a national level. Essentially for disbandment to work, majority of every nation state needs to collude in disbanding it. However it's basically the prisoners dilemma in that the country that defects from the collusion benefits as innovation and opportunity in the space would flee to that geolocation. and they'd have more of a first mover advantage. This essentially leads to everyone defecting from enforcement. Japan's move is essentially the first domino that will lead to every nation eventually embracing Bitcoin. If the state does not embrace it and tries to stifle it, they will essentially miss out in the long run. This is essentially what happened with China trying to control their internet for so long and has caused them to play catch up in the dot com space. It's the reason why they will not make Bitcoin illegal there either because in large part their people would benefit greatly from the long term success of it as they are huge first movers in the space.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:18:44

I wouldn't necessarily stop talking about it, but you have to just discuss what problems bitcoin solves and how it create value for users. Saying I am trying to get a family member into Bitcoin makes it seem like a sales pitch and why a lot of people still view it as a ponzi (e.g. getting someone to bring in money to increase its value). Its important to just display your passion for it, but at the same time not giving a shit if someone else doesn't think its useful or doesn't want to use it. If you having a general discussion there is nothing wrong with having informed rebuttals to many common objections of bitcoin (e.g. security in this case).

Correct. The only reason people should do this is if they can't use it to pay for certain things that they need or they are just trying to diversify their portfolio (in the future they won't need fiat to do so). If people are selling bitcoin to fiat and then using that fiat to purchase something they could've paid for with Bitcoin they are missing the bigger picture. Keep it in the cypto economy! There's very little reason to trade back to USD or other currencies, especially as the market grows, because you'll be able to purchase equities and other investments with bitcoin. Eventually bitcoin reaches such a market size that there is no reason to go back into fiat. The market won't just be liquid to exchange for other fiat currencies, but to purchase anything, anywhere. That will be a beautiful moment.

Price is determined by buyers and sellers on the exchanges. The books are filled with both buyers (bids) and sellers (asks) and the price that is displayed by an exchange, is the last trade that took place on the books. It operates just like a stock price.

@_date: 2016-07-17 20:56:37
Its all about security. Mt. Gox is not a valid argument because it essentially got robbed and is not an error in the protocol. If someone broke into your house and stole your gold or cash, you would not blame the gold or cash. The security was not up to standards to prevent the theft. You could make the argument that is bitcoin is much more secure than cash or gold because it is more covert in its ability to hide and move (e.g. it is simply just a number). It simply destroys gold as money. [This]( is a good example of the power of numbers and breaks down what Bitcoin is working with from a layman mathematical stand point. If you simply store your bitcoins offline (paper wallet) or use a 3rd party mobile wallet with opensource trusted security you will be fine.

The funny thing about revolutionary technology is we really have no idea how it will develop and how quickly it will change the world.

In the near future banks will have to change their business plans, and then long term banks as we know them today will most likely die out.
@_date: 2016-07-17 16:44:14
I would make mention of the reality of negative interest rates and how money all over the world is chasing yields. This for the first time has convinced a large majority of funds to purchase gold. Bitcoin is just gold 2.0 is a better form of money in every way. It is easily portable and divisible, which is not the case for gold. In order for gold to effectively work as money there must be some trusted central party that manage the gold so that it can operate effectively as a medium of exchange. Bitcoin does not have this added administrative level as it is decentralized by nature. This makes it more efficient and is a trustless system. With a global world where people from different countries are doing business bitcoin is the only real practical solution for sound money. It will take time to build out on its scalability, but once people start losing trust in the current fiat system along with the banks, tons of money will be poured into it due to its greatest feature (freedom to the individual).

I mean it’s a pretty short history, but for the most part it’s always been a good time to accumulate. The bottom looks like it is from the huge bull run we had from 2015-2017.

Why don't you just give him some of yours, that's conveniently sitting next to your computer right this moment?

Well to be fair the father obviously wasn't for taking the advice from his son. But when someone tells you of an opportunity and you find out you could've made 50 times your invested capital in a very short amount of time, you might think your son knows something that you don't. I can understand this happening. I mean he would be wise to obviously look into bitcoin himself and manage his own money, but let's be honest if this is America it's well known that most people don't know how to manage their money. Just look around.

People aren't always willing to hold on to money even if they are guaranteed the price will go up. Time is the largest factor. Sadly we as humans have a finite amount of time that we experience during our lives. Hence we rationalize when best to consume and save given both our present and future wants and needs. Does an investor in a company that is extremely confident in the future of his company never sell his shares? The answer is no. Even with the future returns he still wants to consume in the present (e.g. go on vacations, buy a house, car, pay for children, etc. etc.) Here is a video from a great documentary on the behavioral economics of although we are guaranteed an amount in the future, we may just consume in the present instead.
