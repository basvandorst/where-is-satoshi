on the SEPA, one was a forgery and the other was a phishing attack. Neither were actually initiated by the person they claimed and so both were reversed. With a SEPA apparently if a transfer goes through, its still possible to reverse it if done in a short enough time period (less than 10 days i believe).

three transactions, 2 over 25k euros and one over 100k. if i recall correctly, there is no responsibility for them to report anything under 15k

localbitcoins, mtgox and bitstamp. I gave them everything they requested and more as I knew I did nothing wrong - including bank account information.

will do, but might be a few weeks.

money laundering and they thought I might be involved in some sort of phishing operation.

depends on what you mean by high profile I suppose...

not yet fluent. I had someone there to translate for me, but mostly was not necessary.

yeah this is true. However the surprise for me was just how swift the action was taken here. There was no letter in the mail asking me to explain myself... it was just police at my door and my account frozen. If there was a process to go through to make it known to the authorities what is happening before it happens, I would have done it.. but I simply had no idea what that might be.

you dont understand, I sent the money from gox last week and they shut down my account this week. There was no possibility of paying taxes as that is done at the end of the year. This was an immediate reaction.

i have a name that would easily pass as anglo

in total around €150k euro
@_date: 2013-10-17 16:49:14
No - Someone else forged a transfer document where the money was directed to my account with someone elses details.

it actually doesnt matter, the police told me it was their legal responsibility to report it - but I use sparkasse.
