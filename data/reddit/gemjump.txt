Is that... actually an amount you can tip? New to this!

I'm in roughly the same position. The sidebar has so much information and linkage that it's wildly helpful. Go check out coinbase, they give you a couple cents worth of bitcoin to play around with and then head over to BitcoinGet.com and you can earn more uBTC!

Hey, i'm right there with you. Learn as we go, right?
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:12:27
Thank you so much, this was very helpful. I just started this whole shindig today and i'm really excited to continue learning (and with any luck, earning!)

Happy to help!

I'm still pretty new to this (couple hours) but CoinBase has an Address Manager on the Account Settings page - you can add addresses and manage all your accounts from one place!

Check out the [wiki]( and get your wallet, then start earning!

I'm new as of an hour ago, so i'm about as noobish as they come. 
So far, i'm on coinbase and trying to earn some uBTC over at BitcoinGet. 
The FAQ on the sidebar really helped me to get started as did [this post](

Thanks for all the info, very informative.

Click on your name in the upper right, the "Account Settings".
On that page, look for the "Bitcoin Addresses" label, and click on it!
