Well it is an Atlanta paper.

The first looks a lot cleaner.

I'm all online too, but if I deposit a check from my phone after business hours, I don't get access to the money till the next day.

Google the first two words.

Its like what the 90's thought the internet would be. And now you own the domain name. Thanks Dave.

I'm a little wierded out by how bad their purchasing page is. And it being just a WordPress.

Exactly. Not everything can be solved by a bitcoin wallet. The notion of giving everything in an entire grocery store a unique price is frankly ludicrous. There are thousands of items in a grocery store, and the inventory changes all the time. Not to mention this would require slapping a qr code sticker on every item in the store, which is incredibly work intensive. The proposed system wouldn't work at all with items like produce which lack barcodes.

Yeah I've seen videos using this. Its almost faster to verify a coinbase account.

Doesn't make a baby safer.

Appearances and quality do matter though, especially for a company that is so reliant on the Internet and which is comprised of people who have a lot of experience. A proper website can be made and put up quickly, as you said.  So why wasn't it? It feels like an oversight, and one that isn't really excusable when you're asking for investors to give you their money and their trust. If they don't have the wherewithal to build their company infrastructure properly, why should I believe they'll handle my money properly?

You can also just use a fake email and name and stuff to sign up for most of these.

Yeah thats kinda the point though. He's saying bitcoin isnt going to replace cards on the short term. So its focus is, you know, a short one.

It's kinda shady for them to shut down the Coinsafe portion of their site. I don't even seem to be able to log in. I didn't have very much in here, but if I did I'd be kinda worried. Keeping that portion of things up and running long enough for people to get their stuff to a new wallet should be the priority, not launching this new venture.
For people who didn't get the email, they asked us to simply reply with an address for our balance to be sent to.

The thing is, hardcore crypto/anonymity folks aren't gonna use it, but then neither are casual users, which are, I think, the target. I don't deny that its a game changer and an important first step but I don't know that atms are really going to be able to succeed in the US until we're able to implement a less clunky and more user friendly kyc solution.

Get a PO box or something.

Because Trezor would have to decide to sell its product to Overstock first.
