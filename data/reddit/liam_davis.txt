So how did the ransomware blackmailers get away with the crime?

I didn't know protect was a synonym for control

What happened in 9/11?

Guys I'm not worried about being hacked. I was just curious how the hell extortionists receive such large amounts of bitcoin without the risk of being identified. Its truly mind boggling. If I set up a myelium wallet with orbot and threatened someone "send me one bitcoin or else your secret will be shared" how do I ensurr sure my door won't be kicked in by the feds? 
P.s I would never do this,I just want to understand how this is going on.

I understand. I just don't see why I get downvoted and ignored. Why not point me in the right direction and help me increase my anonymity? I'm not doing anything illegal, I just want to be private.

I believe that people are starting to get the picture. The big banks, Russia... They are all getting ready for the future of blockchain.. Stockbrokers are going to be whining about how they could have bought in at $12,000.

I'm going through the same problem
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:01:38
Well...not necessarily. Look at econ personalities  like Jim Kramer from Mad Money. He isn't even permitted knowledge of what stocks he owns! If he were dedicated to manipulating the market, could you imagine the impact he could make? Well the federal government has, and that's why its *ambiguously* illegal

I'm going to call into his radio show and say "Peter, I bet you $500,000 that bitcoin will be worth four times more 15 years from now. 
He's gonna be like
 Peter: "I'm not a gambler, I'm trying to save people money!"
Me: Yeah, Ok Peter.

Let's go back to my analogy involving Kramer. Let's say for example Jim Kramer begins his segment of Mad Money by saying: EVERYONE SELL YOUR BITCOIN NOW, ITS A BUBBLE! This could very well be a direct attack on the USD given its correlation to crypto, as well as it could be the opposite. 
Either way, bitcoin is a platform that has the potential to influence the USD, and it is a threat. You can come up with technicality loopholes all day long, but the federal government still has significant inclination to get what they want.

No, its highly illegal
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:02:57
Illegal is utilizing that story from anonymous as a platform to influence prices
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:44:50
You got me. About every government I can think of

I understand the fundamentals of bitcoin very well. Read my previous comments more carefully, find a reference point, add more detail to your questions, and I will answer them.
