200BTC doesn’t make you a whale because that’s next to nothing compared to ACTUAL whales. The whales are influencers of the market. 200BTC might seem like a lot of money to the average person, but it’s a very small amount. That’s how severe the rich/poor divide is.
Day trading is a zero-sum game. To be profitable, you have to be better than the average trader, and you entering the market and doing well means someone else is doing worse and will leave. It makes way more sense to just hold. Especially with crypto, where it’s so volatile and unpredictable. Day trading crypto is gambling, period. There’re strategies, yeah, but there are strategies in poker, too. Heck, even slot machines sometimes have strategies.

So basically, you do exactly what everyone else is doing, but you publish your results and use fancier words? Many of our predictions come true, too. Maybe we should all be professional analysts
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:19:40
Fair enough, I guess we agree to some extent then. I’ll assume what you do is the same but with way more data per worker, leading to more comprehensive results.

So....exactly what the rest of us are doing?

Except that’s now how he became a billionaire and not how he invests. That’s what he’ll tell you, yes, but have you tried actually looking at what he chooses, analyzing why he chose it, and seeing how things work out? Warren Buffet is a terrible investor with good connections.

You didn't really lose money. You just didn't profit because you were making plans and expecting things that couldn't be guaranteed, trying to take advantage of small slots of time during which you have no actual control over anything except whether or not you click the button. Stay humble.

Wow, did you just call that person an “it”? How dare you dehumanize them?
@_date: 2018-10-26 02:52:15
Whoops, huge brain fart
edit: wait, now’s my chance. How dare you insinuate that a man is worthy of respect as opposed to a human

Okay, so day-to-day shifts actually don’t matter then? If it takes a few days to weeks to reach the consumer, but one of today’s whales (who will get smaller by percentage as adoption keeps moving forward) can only cause a few days to a week of influence, then what’s the problem?
@_date: 2019-02-15 15:31:48
I couldn’t disagree more. When people learn from their mistakes and and change their mind, they’re seen as honorable and humble. 
When people don’t learn from their mistakes yet change their mind to pretend like they did, they SHOULD be ridiculed.

I wouldn’t say they deserve it since they’ve been placed in their situations rather than intentionally choosing it. There are only so many places you can go when you have all your options stripped from you. We need those who know better to be even better and more skilled in order to fight back and communicate in the proper way without getting our emotions or impatience tangled up in anything and resetting our progress.
@_date: 2019-12-16 13:55:10
With the capability of communication we have today, we could fix that. The root of all our problems, though, is our education system. The average person digs themselves deeper and deeper because they’re completely oblivious to what’s going on and why things are the way they are. Then if you throw in their faces, they “don’t wanna hear about that kinda stuff.”

You can’t build a real conclusion from a mountain of bullshit that you heard on Reddit a few months ago. Just wait for the history books if you can’t process things yourself.
@_date: 2019-12-04 12:15:15
There is no investment perspective if the adoption goes wrong.

Are we back to GPU mining already?

Or even just when you take your pants off. There’s really no reason anything should be left in pockets when doing laundry.

Why would you spend your Bitcoin when the value is relatively low? Isn’t that the exact opposite of buy low sell high? If you need that money, it shouldn’t have been invested.
@_date: 2018-12-03 15:52:28
Would you not rather just leave your investment there? There’s plenty of potential for it to explode out of nowhere as well. At worst, you lose your investment, which shouldn’t bother you if you’re actually investing rather than gambling your savings away. At best, your small investment gets you a new car. If you’re investing larger amounts of money, then none of this applies because you’d be diversifying and probably would’ve already mostly pulled out of Bitcoin long ago.
