In that case that comment is so general that it’s barely worth saying, because the same can be said about so many things.
“What’s the point of your PhD dissertation?”
“Congrats, here is your mathematics PhD”
Sure, it’s not wrong, but it’s not really right either.

Yea, but not that general! Everybody is either happy already, or is pursuing happiness. And if either of those ceases to be true, then that's probably when they commit suicide. So if you're talking to a person who's alive, then it's a given that you and him are both either happy already, or want to be happy. Kinda like, "what's the ultimate point of John hiring attorney Joe to act on his behalf in criminal lawsuit X?" "The ultimate point is to be a good lawyer." No, buddy. That's not the answer we're looking for lol. The answer is more like, "To keep John from going to prison." See the difference? One is a "duuhhhhh" answer, and another is the right answer.

Did somebody say billion?

WRONG! Money is not the source of happiness, it only makes it a little easier to be happy if you have a lot of it, not by much though.

Regarding the SF price model... what happens when Bitcoin’s flow (production) goes to zero? The model has Bitcoin price is proportional to SF^3 , so if production goes to zero, SF ratio is infinite.
Does the model break down, or do all monetary assets pour into Bitcoin at that time?

Stock flow of Bitcoin will be zero someday.... what happens then?

You are highly intelligent.

Which Micro Center??

I definitely do not have a Master's degree in physics from an ivy league university located in Philadelphia. I have definitely never studied quantum physics, special or general relativity. I didn't understand E=mc^2 when I was in 4th grade. I never studied the double slit experiment, Mössbauer spectroscopy, quantum entanglement and Bell's inequalities. I did not graduate in the top of my class. I definitely do want to be just as intelligent as you.
And I am most certain that none of the above statements are lies.

This is exactly the kind of answer I was looking for. I specifically asked for an explanation of how Lightning Network works. I definitely did NOT ask for a source of development updates in general terms (e.g. alpha1, alpha2, beta, etc.). I was very clear in my question that I wanted a long, detailed, complicated explanation of the functioning of the Lightning Network, such as the one you have provided. I am so glad you took the time to write all of this. I definitely read the whole thing at least once. I definitely didn't just ignore the whole thing. Thank you for your consideration.

So, those 10% of payments that failed... that was just a software failure that didn’t result in any loss of funds? Like, you tried to make a payment but there was a glitch in the software or something so it simply didn’t execute the payment and your funds were left intact?
