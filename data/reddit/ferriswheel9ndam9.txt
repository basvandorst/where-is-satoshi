This is the part that frustrates me because what we have is a huge engineering challenge but there's a feeling that it's more ego based than anything else. Smart people should be working together to solve this problem not be divided on political lines. 
On the bright side, all these forkcoins are nice guinea pig for BTC. If one of them comes up with a solution and is open source, BTC team can just assimilate its advantages and continue streamrolling ahead as the premier cryptocurrency.

Better yet, call it Bitcoin Cash 2 and get it on exchanges as BCH2. The LULZ will be great.

This sounds very reasonable. I'm very curious on the power of insider knowledge especially moments before the Tether unwinds. You could theoretically make a killing by selling your BTC for real USD just as people are dumping their Tether for BTC.
I had completely forgotten about the recent ICO hearings. Does that include auditing of US companies that are involved in any cryptos or just ICOs?

Oh man, this ticking time bomb is some serious MonkaS. But exactly what would be its effects? If it turns out that Tether was just printing money, would its value drop to 0?
But out of scientific curiosity, what exactly happens when another currency crashes? When BTC goes down, everything goes down. When an altcoin dies, it's usually a drop in the ocean. Tether claims to have a market cap of ~2.2 billion (as of March 2018) but unlike other coins, this is supposed to be backed by USD and theoretical perfect liquidity. If it comes crashing down, everyone that traded BTC/altcoins for Tether are just to be at a pure loss. Will it shake faith in cryptocurrency in general?

People look down on humble beginnings but then ignore it once something is big.
Reddit was nothing more than a porn sharing site when it first came out.

I hate it when someone looks at a coin, sees that it's $3 at 1 billion coin supply and assume that the coins have $3 billion market value. 
*Edit, Yes it has $3 billion market cap but they're usually thinking that's how much it's all worth which is not true. 
We are nowhere near that level of market liquidity and if someone dumps a million dollars worth of that $3 billion dollar coin, I'm pretty sure it will drop down real fast and its true market cap revealed.
I'm sure there's a math algorithm out there somewhere to show the true market cap of an asset by market movement and the theoretical market cap.

Market cap is basically just measurement of cost per share * number of shares. You have the market cap of an individual coin as well as market cap of all coins put together. 
The issue is that this number is misleading due to low liquidity.
Say you have 10 shitCoinX. There are only 100 shitCoinX in circulation and the current price it's being traded for is $10 per coin. The market cap would appear to be 100 * $10 = $1000.
It is misleading to assume that all coins can be sold to produce a total value transfer into some other form of $1000. If the moment you sell your coin, the only buy order for 1 shitCoinX at $10 was filled, this would be the equivalent of low liquidity. The next buy order is $9.50 for 1 coin and so on and so forth. When you sell all your coins, the market drops as a whole. So the next evaluation of market cap will be 100 shitCoinX * $6.50 (only $650!) not to mention that you never got your theoretical $100 for your sell order of 10 shitCoinX. 
This is why it's important to not think of market cap as the total wealth available in an asset. 
Now, in an extremely high volume (think of it as trades per second) and low volatility (buy and sell orders are clumped up around one stable number region. Any order that diverges too far is either never met or instantly purchased and doesn't affect market), you WOULD be able to cash out all your coins because your trades get lost in the great river of wealth transfer. 
My point is that be cautious on what numbers you use to calculate the "value" part of an asset. This goes beyond cryptos, it applies to any form of tradeable asset. If you only use the current market value, it is not guaranteed to be accurate.
