Yeah, put it in an online exchange instead, where it's safe.  :-P

It was not a bad decision.  If I had them on my home wallet and my house burned down (backup drive is in the house too) I would have still lost them.  There is risk involved either way.  I figured mine would be safer in an exchange than at home.  It was the wrong decision in retrospect, but that does not make it a bad one.

Not whole, anyway.

I've been mining for a year now and saved up 0.4 BTC on Gox... I have 0.04 BTC on the home wallet.  Dang, I was hoping to build up to 1 full BTC.  Time to start over.

It's kind of hard to dox a reporter... people already know who she is.

Yes, and trillions more in the rest of the galaxy.  Do the classification schemes fall apart if we add more than 8 for our solar system?  I'm okay with hundreds of smaller outer planets.  Anything big enough to be spherical that does not orbit something bigger is a planet.

An experienced coder would... I know a lot of smart people who do dumb things.

Back in the pre-$10 days, I had a friend who had his Bitcoins on his home computer, backed up on an external drive.  His house burned down and he still lost them all.
You can't anticipate every situation.

Why aren't they planets?  I want more planets.

There was a $200,000 deposit required to place a bid.

There have already been suits started.  Bankruptcy protection will stop or delay those.

You could look into a server based fax system that will let you view pages and only print the ones you want.

Bitcoin is secure... Mt. Gox was not.  It's like cash in that regard... if someone steals your wallet, it's not a failure of the currency.

I stuck with it and finally got my May order.  I think it'll be good for the long run.  It'll help heat the house this winter too, and in 10 months, I'll have a Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:29:44
When you count the partial Bitcoin I have from GPU mining, yes.

When you point, a dog will look where you are pointing.  A cat will look at your finger.

That would be awesome, but he said he was a guy.

So Quantitative Easing is fancypants for "Inflation"?
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:21:08
That is enormously regressive.  Poor people have to pay 100% of their income on purchasing things.  Rich people don't.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:32:15
He strikes me as being a very organized person.  I suspect he has cashed in quite a few Bitcoins and is simply using restraint to avoid cashing out the ones that he knows people are looking at.

I'm sure I'm being delusional, but it suddenly feels like it's worth soooooo much more- probably because I actually have it on hand.  (see [endowment effect] ( ).

It is now.
