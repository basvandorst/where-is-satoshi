I bought mine locally by looking through Craigslist. I scored 298$ in BTC and 11$ in BCH with only 280$ in cash. Avoid anyone selling Bitcoin at a premium, except if the fee is used to pay the miner's fee. I use the Bitcoin Wallet app from Android, because the wallet doesn't take 100gb of storage, it can be backed up and it is very anonymous compare to exchanges. You can extract your private keys with softwares if you're ever planning to use your Bitcoin Android wallet on your computer. Make sure you use one address per transaction to stay the most anonymous.

The name of the app is Bitcoin wallet by Bitcoin wallet developers. I had a backup file on cloud and I put a password on it. The password worked and now the app says that it is synchronizing with the network.

I bought my Bitcoins in person with cash from someone who has an account with Coinbase. My wallet is not from an exchange and buying them from exchanges would require my ID.

I did more research online and saw that the backup will work with all my Bitcoins returned only if I made less than 100 transactions. "Because only 100 or so keys are generated in advance so the backup is only valid for 100 transactions (change addresses)." I'm lucky that I only made 10 addresses change during those 22 months. Therefore, it is necessary to do regular backup depending on the numbers of transactions you do so that you can get all of your Bitcoins back.

I finally got my full wallet synced. It took me 10.5 hours to sync a 22 month old wallet that had 2 transactions in it and 5$ in btc. 
I checked the transaction fee and I can send 0.31 mBTC with a fee of 0.04 mBTC using the economic fee fare. How much do the fees cost you guys for sending 0.31 mBTC?

I mean how much do you pay for your current wallet?

It's been 5 hours since it is syncing and it is still at 22 months. How long does the synchronization take on the app?

Never mind. I just received mine 14 hours later.
