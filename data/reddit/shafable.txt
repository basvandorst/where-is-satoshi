[Tunnelbear]( is a great VPN solution which I use (and recommend).  They are Toronto based, making them outside CISA fuckery, and they accept bitcoin if you purchase yearly access.
Plus there are adorable fluffy bears in the tunnels, which is clearly the most important component of internet security.

Has anyone paid you 100 bitcoin for your silence yet?

They get a thumbs up from me.  Ran into issues while trying to link my checking account, emailed support and received a human reply within 10 hours. (I went to bed and had a reply when I woke up)
When you try to link a bank account, they make two small deposits which you have to identify and then enter how much the deposits were for into Circle's verification page.  I received 4 deposits, totaling slightly over 2 USD, and no matter which order I entered them, I was unable to verify my bank account.
I sent them a short email explaining the situation, and they canceled the verification.  I ran through the verification again, and it worked with no issues.
**TLDR:** Circle customer support gets my personal [seal of approval!](

I have both a credit card and debit card (both MasterCard).  I tried them both, credit card wouldn't work (I tried 4 separate times), debit card worked first time.
(I have since linked my bank account directly for no fee purchases...)

It was an honest question, I have you tagged as: 100 BTC for his silence
Curious how that worked out
**EDIT**: I tagged you as that because of [this post]( you made, where you made [this comment](
You'll always be famous to me mate!

They will be more likely to do that when bitcoin donations account for more the &gt;1% of their total donations.
Seriously people, the thing that will improve adoption rates is USING your coin, not making a snarky comment that they didn't make it easy enough for you.

Very impressed with Circle's simplicity and user friendly UI.  My girlfriend has been aware of my bitcoin fascination for ages, but the thing that got HER using bitcoin was your app.

I contacted  on twitter asking how to get in on the test rollout, and they directed me send an email to coinbase_admin
No response from them yet, but fingers crossed!

I would rather have the price of a coin to have some stability, and more places to spend them
