I use coinsquare and quadrigacx
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:41:41
Haven't had any issues with coinsquare. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:52:59
It's not working - it's making me verify my ID again. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:28:21
This is so stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:05:27
I'm all in. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:23:00
Gdax would not verify me with my provincial id
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:57:32
Yes. I'm verified on coinbase and I'm having a  hell of a time being verified on gdax. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:29:44
I'd rather use dogecoin... No fees and transfers are instant. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:35:24
I'm trying to but it won't let me sign up. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:08:18
When I do it through the coinbase app it does the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:39:43
It's saying a bunch of stuff does not match 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:53:52
I decided to take the hit on the transfer fee and get all my coins off coinbase and on to quadrigacx - seems a lot better for Canadians. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:22:22
Gdax wouldn't accept any of my provincial ids
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:52:57
Sounds like it.

Gdx won't accept the same id I used for coinbase 
@_date: 2016-02-12 04:29:20
Does this work for Canadians? 
@_date: 2016-02-09 05:55:36
used this for a long time. works great.
@_date: 2016-02-12 03:42:18
