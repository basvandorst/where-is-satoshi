I'm not sure I even understand your question/point. No one aside from the US government can print US dollars. When you pay with paypal, money is withdrawn from your paypal account, or bank account. Honestly, not to be rude, but this is incredibly basic stuff, I imagine even a child would know.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:27:53
You think a crypto exchange can print American dollars?
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:43:13
Dude, you are mentally disturbed and have no idea what you're talking about. Your inability to understand how regular online transactions work today makes it impossible for you to even begin to understand what blockchain and teather is, and why tether is a big problem for exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:15:09
Holy shit you are dumb. Do you think it's sustainable for exchanges to keep paying out FIAT when the market is being pumped by Tether being printed out of thin air?
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:19:10
They're not *printing* new money, they're transferring existing money from one account to another.
Are you sure you should be involved in bitcoin investing?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:42:48
But that's pure speculation. You don't know what will go up and what won't. Every reasonable person knows that most of the alts that are around today can't survive in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:19:53
I can't believe this shit is getting upvoted. It's a horrible representation of bitcoin investing. Sell in the year 2040? So you mean it's not a currency, just a "get rich" thing you invest in and hodl? Like beanie babies or tulips? Anyone who seriously cares and tries to hype Bitcoin as a get rich scheme should be ashamed of themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:58:21
But you realize bitcoin only does well against fiat when more and more people pour money into it, hoping they're going to get rich? Do you not see anything wrong with that cycle? You're invested, worry about yourself. Be glad you own bitcoins. If you want to "help your friends out", then explain to them that it's a highly volatile and fairly risky business to get into, but if it excites them, they should invest. Simply telling people bitcoin is going to make them rich is as scammy as it gets.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:44:25
It's quite obviously going up because people are speculating and pumping it up, hence the drastic fall it's experiencing now.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:34:22
Also, the whole idea that you want to buy bitcoin now to get rich is pretty gross. Bitcoin should grow because of the features and usability/market adoption, NOT because more and more people are buying in to get rich. That's called a fucking ponzi/bubble, and anyone hyping it, like OP and the people upvoting him, are facilitating this sick behavior.
If you truly believe in Bitcoin, and you believe in the technology, then you should not have to entice people into investing by telling them it's going to make them rich. That's just an incredibly selfish and moronic way of pumping up the short-term value of your investment, and it sucks that this is all this sub is about these days.

Yeah, but the scene had nothing to do with selling or holding. If you've never seen the movie before, but heard of it, and seen this meme, you expect it to be from some heroic point where he decided to NOT SELL when a stock or something was crashing, only to be greatly rewarded for it on the bounce.
I mean, as a "meme", it really makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:34:29
Can someone explain this meme to me? I watched WoWS a few months ago, and to my dismay, the movie really had nothing to do with being a good trader or anything like that. It was just about some guy who ran a huge scam/ponzi with a bunch of other people.

$350 is pretty close to ath. Basically it seems he sold off a huge amount everytime ltc hit a new peak. Also, why announce he sold it AFTER the fact? This would be illegal in a regulated market, yet, he acts like it was noble of him, lmao.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:39:06
So you just had to preface your market analysis by saying sold at the top? Like it's supposed to mean something? And now you're trying to humblebrag that you're retired at 27. Good luck, lol, let's see how long your retirement lasts.

Literally every single time there's been a dip in Bitcoin in the past, it's recovered. How is it the worst advice ever, unless you've suddenly lost all hope in the coin?
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:29:24


Charlie Lee is one of the sneakiest con artists of all time. He actually convinced people that he was being noble by selling all his ltc at peak prices, without informing the market about it first, which would be illegal in a regulated market. Scumbag move, but because of how cryptocurrency works, Lee knew that ltc holders would support and protect his decision, and drink the kool-aid he was serving, because anything else would cause panic in the ltc market, causing the price to fall. By default, if you're the type of person who invests in a coin and then speaks positively about it online, you are a yes-man, because being a no-man would hurt your investment.

No, I don't. You're a wackjob. Kim only does whatever will make him money; legitimate or otherwise. He's not trying to erase anything, he moves from one scheme to the next. And I'm not saying Bitcoin is a scheme, but Dotcom is obviously heavily invested in it and wants to talk it up. Everything he says should be completely ignored.

Are you implying his daughter understands exactly what Bitcoin is? Or do you think it's more likely daddy has been talking about how it's going to make them rich? Math and science, lol, that has nothing to do with this discussion.

If the US wants to, it could ban crypto tomorrow and make all crypto-dealings illegal, forcing exchanges to close and making it almost impossible for Americans to purchase crypto with Fiat, and certainly, they wouldn't be able to spend it anywhere.

Language is something that comes naturally to children growing up with it. I suppose that child was tri-lingual? Which is impressive, but does not require the understanding of intricate concepts.
The child can't possibly grasp investing in bitcoin for the mear fact that they haven't lived long enough to understand what risk and consequences are. Even if she DID somehow understand the complex details of bitcoin, which I sincerely doubt, she can't understand what "investing" in it means.
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:11:04
How are they able to offer a 10% discount for BTC? I thought typical payment fees were only 2% or something?

Why do people ALWAYS have to mention that they sold at the peak? Do you think it makes you a trading genius or something? You got lucky, it doesn't mean you know more about Bitcoin than anyone else here who's been in it for a long time.
@_date: 2017-10-08 00:13:24
But bitcoin is a speculative currency. No matter how much you believe in it, no matter how much you think it's going to "moon", it's still speculation. I don't know what lessons OP thinks he's teaching his daughter, but imo, it comes off as a bit obsessive and sad.
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:01:23

He has committed fraud multiple times in multiple countries over a longer timeframe, and his MEGA empire was built on profiting off of copyrighted material. Why would anyone want someone with a history of fraud and eluding authorities as a Bitcoin spokesperson? You probably wouldn't be so fond of him either if you were one of his victims. Aside from that, you sound mildly autistic and paranoid.
@_date: 2017-10-08 00:33:47
That's ridiculous logic. I wish my dad had gotten me Apple stock when I was born. What's the valuable experience she's getting? For a 6-year-old to say she wants to invest her winnings in Bitcoin shows that her dad has already spoken way too much about it with her. I mean, Jesus, it's a currency. She's 6 years old!

The issue with LN, and Bitcoin's progress is that most disruptive technologies start off complicated, and become more user-friendly over time. Bitcoin is heading the opposite direction with LN.

@_date: 2017-06-14 19:36:35


But what is the big difference, really? The price of a cryptocurrency is related to how much people believe in the coin -- how much value is BEHIND the coin. So for instance, we're in a time right now where there is a ton of uncertainty, a ton of speculation, and that's the main driving force behind the prices. The prices aren't going up because people are actually wanting to coins to use them, they're going up because people are investing in them. For ETH to have a sustainable $30bil+ cap, there would have to be a ton of people actually USING the coin. And $30 bil isn't just a bit, it's a fuck ton. But, as of right now, hardly anyone is using it for anything that isn't a crypto-gimmick.

But don't banks give the government insight into how much you have stored? I know that if I was being paid a lot of money, let's say not through a regular job, but through various people and not taxing it, the government would notice at the end of the year (if I made enough money and didn't pay taxes). But the same can't be said if I made that money in crypto, right?

Its market cap is almost the same as Facebook's when it IPO'd with around a billion users. Facebook is the most successful internet company by far in the past decade, yet Ethereum is somehow almost as valuable, except it has zero proof that it will actually be useful in a way that generates money.
