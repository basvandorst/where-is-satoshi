Why are people still buying on the Chinese exchanges then? With definitive answer in the op this just doesn't make sense.
The volume doesn't equate to offshore accounts, you'd have to figure at least 90% of their accounts were mainland. Why the volume? 
I think we're going to see a lot of movement today and it should start in the next half hour or so but in either case why are the Chinese still buying with such uncertainty. 
Because whenever there is any doubt there is no doubt.

well said and an interesting opinion. to me  its irrational in the sense that good news comes out in droves, prices should reflect that. If news breaks today prices should go up, theoretically. If new news comes out (not news you assume to be priced in) and the market reacts negatively, this is an irrational action IMO.
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:11:56
At the end of the day the statement you initially provided is false, there was no intention to screw people who use bitcoin. 
Its just like dealing with cash or anything else really, ultimately at the end of the day responsibility comes down to the end user.
@_date: 2014-03-30 05:38:23
Absolutely rediculous. As a consumer, I know these costs are going to be passed on to me. 
As a BTC enthusiasts, I hope there will be large adoption due tP the realization of the masses that their getting screwed.

If you want to be profitable, probably not worth it. Depends on how much your spending per GH. Lots of calculators online, I like the genesisblock on that was posted earlier. You will always have to have the latest and greatest to keep up with the big boys as your hardware will quickly become outdated and you'll have to reinvest to remain profitable.
If your in it for  altruistic reasons, or as a hobby, its pretty rewarding (not monetarily / bitcoinitarily)

In regards to The information JW provided about the coverage / attention bitcoin is  is in severe contrast with what I have found about through numerous associates based in china and HK. 
I have yet to find one person that I have spoken to (mainland and HK), 20+, that has not heard of BTC. Many have describe BTC there to be Huge news and many people are "bitcoin crazy."
