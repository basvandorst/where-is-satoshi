The hashes is only data, and data isn't a form of energy. After the hashes are made the energy will continue somewhere else.  A very small amount of energy is indeed turned into light and sound. you are absolutely right about that.

The power has to go somewhere! If it is, as you say, that an Ethernet cord can't power an PC (and certainly not a mining farm) then it is physically impossible that the energy could escapes that way. End of story!

Sorry, I was thinking of fiber optic cables, which is the cables often used in high speed connections. Fiber optics can never send electricity. 
Do you honestly believe that the thin Ethernet cables can send a high current? If you tried to push, the majority of the computers energy consumption, it would instantly melt and catch fire! It is ridiculous to believe that the energy escapes in that small cord, and later (by magic) is sent trough fiber optics, or in any form of wireless connection. 
The vast majority of energy is turned into heat. End of story!

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can't be destroyed, but simply turn into something else. The energy you put into a miner will always turn into some other kind of energy.

Ridiculous! There is no electrical pulses though either a ethernet cable or a wireless network. What cables are you talking about?
