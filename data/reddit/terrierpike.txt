Lol.  The hash rate drives the difficulty level.  Yes, they're different units, just like a barrel of Oil is not a gallon of Gasoline.  However, the price of Oil drives the price of Gasoline as it is a major input.   When oil moves down (as it is this week) the price of gasoline follows.  If you plot them on the same graph you see a clear correlation between them, even though they are "different units".

I agree with you on everything but discussing salary.  I've worked in a few different corporate cultures.  One of them people were open about their salaries, the other it was a standard don't ask don't tell environment.  
Being an accountant , I have access to emoloyee payroll.  Trust me, you make more money in a private system..... A lot more. 
If everyone knows what everyone else makes, it caps salaries.  Instead of you being paid for your individual quality and contributions they can just say, "sorry, everyone knows we pay programmers $70k, we're an open culture."
If no one knows, then everyone must negotiate their rate, and those who negotiate well pull everyone else up with them.

Actually, I've never bought the same thing twice with bitcoins for a different price, mainly because I've held it for some time instead of spending them.
By contrast, I have paid a different $ amount for the same item throughout my life, only, the dollar amount seems to be rising against the goods purchased (gasoline / food / housing / college / etc).  As such, since the prices in $ are rising relative to the items received, BY YOUR LOGIC, I should be able to call this an "income reducing activity" and get to take a capital loss.

OK, let's give BTC a value of $100,000/coin, i'm fine with that.  Now let's multiply that by the .0017/person to give everyone an earth equal share.  
$100,000/BTC * .0017BTC/Person = $170/person
Well, I don't know about you, but i still don't see Bitcoin as a savior in this scenario either. $170 for every person is not a game changer when the wealth of the world is well north of $200T in total.
$100,000/BTC * 12M coins = $1,200,000,000,000 Market cap... or just about 0.5% of global wealth (this would be a high estimate).
Basically, if we take all the bitcoins at the highest value you can muster, they still aren't impactful enough to be material to global finance.

Not really.  This is not how demand curves shift to the right.  News doesn't change demand unless its news about a variable which would change behavior related to the asset.  Hearing about a website accepting bitcoins doesn't change demand for bitcoins because you still can use credit/debit/PayPal without incurring the risk of holding a volatile currency. 
To illustrate:
Neighbor :
"Hey the newspaper says they're putting a McDonald's on the corner down the street!"
Which is the more likely response:
1) Me: "Cool, I really like McDonald's, now I'm gonna eat there everyday"
2) Me: "Cool. I'll probably eat McDonald's about the same as always because there's still one like 5 minutes away, a Wendy's next door, a Chipotle down the road, and another Burger King by my workplace."
You see, news about the new McDonald's doesn't change my desire for a Big Mac at the new location because I have substitutes. News about Tigerdirect.com accepting bit coin doesn't matter to me because I can still use Paypal and get the same price, without incurring the costs and risk necessary to acquire bit coin.
To change demand it would take news like "McDonald's has bought all the beef in the world.  It's now the only place you can buy a hamburger."  In that situation, my demand for Big Macs would shift to the right, because there would be no substitute (at least, no direct cheap substitute), this shift in the curve would result in a higher equilibrium price for McDonald's.

Are you familiar with the term "Catch-22"?  Because you're illustrating it here perfectly.  You noted in your earlier post that 


That is, as the price stabilizes, more vendors will accept bitcoin as a currency.  Then, you also note above 


I agree with you to an extent.  You get more stability/liquidity through more bitcoins spread and widely adopted by many merchants.  This way individual transactions of BTC don't affect the price substantially.  
This is my problem, you haven't answered my question, you haven't said HOW.  
You realize you're saying opposite things, right?  One does not flow from the other.
You're saying that 1) as more vendors accept Bitcoin, the BTC price will stabilize.  You're also saying that the 2) BTC price won't stabilize until more vendors accept Bitcoin.
Those statements are by definition, a catch-22, you've just inverted your If/Then arguments, without giving a solution as to HOW.  This is the biggest flaw with Bitcoiners in general.
Bitcoiner - "As soon as everyone uses BTC it as currency, the price will go to the moon"
Questioner of Bitcoin - "Why would you use it as a currency instead of another currency? What's the advantage?"
Bitcoiner - "The advantage of Bitcoin is that it's going to the moon."
Questioner of Bitcoin - "If I know it's going to the moon, why wouldn't I hold it and let other currencies devalue against it?"
Bitcoiner - "Well, if you hold it, then it won't get adopted as a currency, because currencies have to be exchanged"
It... doesn't... end... it's a circular argument that goes around and around... someone get's left holding the bag in the end.

Yes, we agree on this.  You must have mild swings either way and things will likely be fine.
Where we seem to be stuck in disagreement, however, is that Bitcoin does not allow even the option for inflation through currency expansion.  As such, you, the consumer, know that prices will fall as they have no other option.   This is very different than having to guess whether or not they will fall.
Maybe this knowledge is a good thing, as you note, however, maybe it's an incredibly bad thing because you can get stuck in a deflationary sprial of never wanting to purchase anything, opportunity cost or not.  Time will tell.

FTFY.  The core CPI index excludes goods with high price volatility, such as food and energy. This measure of core inflation systematically excludes food and energy prices because, historically, they have been highly volatile and non-systemic. More specifically, food and energy prices are widely thought to be subject to large changes that often fail to persist and do not represent relative price changes. In many instances, large movements in food and energy prices arise because of supply disruptions such as drought or OPEC-led cutbacks in production. This was introduced in the early 1970s when food and especially oil prices were quite volatile, and the Fed wanted an index that was less subject to short term shocks.
tl:dr  It's not an average if you compare different baskets over time and exclude the things that actually impact consumers on a DAILY basis.s

I see what's going on here, you don't know the difference between a verb and an adjective.  You see, I was commenting on the initial statement which notes that btc is definitely a "HOLD".  This is an adjective, which means it is describing a property of a noun, in this case, it's describing your investment projection for bitcoin.  You believe it's worth holding for some period which is not the same as rating it a "buy". 
You also say you "hold" when the price is going up.  This is a verb, which represents an action.  In this case, it's you keeping possesion of the asset during rising prices.
You're using the word "hold" in two different ways, and not understanding how that difference conveys two very different meanings.

The maximum?  Are we assuming that the population is also stable? 
If not, the # of bitcoins/person is falling, resulting in a higher purchasing value per coin (deflation).  If you were working, this would mean you'd be paid less nominal BTC every year.  
For example, if you're paid 10BTC in a month, and your mortgage is 1BTC and locked for 20 years, then your mortgage is 10% of your pay in year 1.  If next year (due to deflation, a feature of BTC's design) you are paid 5BTC, your mortgage is still 1BTC (because it's fixed), your mortgage is now 20% of your pay.
Repeat this over 20 years and you've got a world where you would never take out a loan on a house, which is my original point.

There's a couple assumptions there: 1) that i'm in the USA and am a citizen, 2) that i plan on converting my coins at all anytime soon, 3) that I have the $ available to pay the IRS in the event I convert
My point is that because the law is retroactive I'm incentivized now to never spend my coins on items because it creates a $ liability, even if I don't receive any fiat for my purchase.  It will stifle adoption substantially in the US.
In fact, the only thing I might do with my coins now is give them to charities and use the value of the BTC to offset my $taxable income.

Not exactly, you will pay fees to coinbase to initially purchase bitcoins, or a premium to a seller on localbitcoins.com.  The simple time spent obtaining the coins, setting up a wallet, securing your computer, are all efforts that cost you time and money.  As such, those are fees incurred.

Take a company like GE for example, you can't buy GE on the SEHK (Hong Kong Stock Exchange), because it's not listed there.  It's listed on the NYSE, so you can only buy securities directly from the company itself (and no, their Investment Affairs office won't be open at 12pm on thanksgiving) or when the NYSE is open for trading.  
No matter the acceptance of BTC, you'll never be buying a US stock at midnight on thanksgiving.  
BTC is cool tech, but it's not really that much of a game-changer.

You can change the currency someone uses, but you can't change the nature of a profit-seeking individual.  I use Bitcoin, and I still plan on profiting during my lifetime.  
Bitcoin is inherently less egalitarian than gold/silver/barter because you actually have to be able to read and count to be able to use it.  This eliminates a huge number of illiterate people from access to the marketplace.  At least with barter systems and gold/silver, a person who can't read could still buy/trade for food.  
For example, "I have eggs and I want bread, I'll go the baker and trade him some eggs."  
If you can't read, how are you supposed to understand and utilize the bitcoin protocol?
Your new "egalitarian" system just excluded 20% of the adult population of the planet from the get-go.

You say that as the market cap grows, the value stabilizes.
Market Cap is a measure of the dollar value of outstanding shares of a company.  That is, the larger the market cap of a company, the more valuable it is.  Therefore, your statement that as the market cap grows, the value stabilizes is just ignorant of reality.  Value growth is not stability.

Because you purchase inventory for building before you build the house.  There is a time lag between the two.  If you buy materials and their value falls substantially because of deflation, you will go out of business.  
Imagine if you'd bought all the tools and supplies on January for 1000BTC.  Your plan was to build a house and you started construction in June.  By the time the house was built, the value of BTC had risen 5000% this happened btw).  That same material would now cost you 2BTC.  The house would not sale for anywhere near 1000BTC (breakeven for materials, no labor included).  In this scenario, you just got put out of business by the deflation of BTC because you have to eat the loss.  You will not continue building houses.
This is the same for almost any business.  Boeing builds planes that take years to build.  They get contracts out 10-15 years in advance.  You can't plan big projects like that with deflationary currency, it just doesn't work.
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:49:19


No, this is not how measuring gains/losses works ....  
First off, a 100 to 400 move in the market isn't a 400% gain, but rather a 300% gain.  You measure gains/losses against your purchase price.  If you bought at 100 and it's 400 now, you've experienced a 300% UNREALIZED gain.... if the price falls to 300, you've experienced a 200% UNREALIZED gain, not a loss at all.  
To calculate gains/losses is simple, the numerator is the market price minus your purchase price, the denominator is your purchase price then you multiply by 100 to get your % gain/loss OR 
Let's use your example, you bought at $100 and the market price is now $400.  
(($400MKT-$100PUR) / $100 PUR) = 3.0*100% = 300% gain
You then state the market price moves to 300. Your new gain/loss calculation is:
(($300 MKT - $100PUR) / $100 PUR) = 2.0*100 = 200% gain.
Note that the market price dipped, but your purchase price is locked.  The idea that going from a 300% gain to a 200% gain somehow equals a loss is what you are misunderstanding.  You write:


No, TO YOU, you are still up 200%, you've lost nothing but UNREALIZED gains.  You've lost no initial principal, in fact, you're still up substantially.


You're the one changing your vantage point, not me,  your vantage point shouldn't ever change (your purchase price).  The only changing variable is the market price, which can be used to calculate your gain/loss, your purchase price is locked at the time of purchase.  In your example, you seem to think you measure gains and losses with the market price as the denominator, which is backwards.    
In investing, you can have infinite gains (bitcoin is up like %10000 over the last few years), but you can only experience losses of 100% if your investment goes to $0 because everyone has a locked purchase price.  
You can lose MORE than 100% only if you're trading with uncovered margins, which based on your example, is a little beyond your capability.

You're saying that BTC has a long way to go, because people are mis/uninformed, right?
My point is that their uninformed nature is correlated, not causitive.  Just because they are uninformed, doesnt' mean BTC goes anywhere.  Their lack of information does not drive BTC to be more widely adopted.  The fact that they know about BTC and don't care at all is even more telling. 
"yeah, i know what bitcoin is."
"will you buy it?"
"it's not for me.", "it's not tangible" "it's manipulated" "people use it for fraud" (insert any excuse from the video)
You see, they've looked at BTC and already made a decision, granted, it IS misinformed, but they've decided it's not for them.  At this point, you can't argue that BTC has farther to go.  They looked at it, and said... nope... even making a bad choice.  Just like a cigarette user who is shown scientific proof they shouldn't smoke, they say... nope, i'm gonna smoke anyway.

Actually, the $ has essentially collapsed in the last 40 years, just slowly.
1974 - 
Cost of a gallon of Gas - 55 cents 
Average cost new car -$3,750.00 
Dozen eggs - $0.45 
Average Income per year - $13,900.00 
Average cost of a house - $38,500.00 
Average Cost of New House $289,500.00 
Cost of a Gallon of Gas $3.80 
Movie Ticket $10.25 
Dozen Eggs $2.88 
Loaf of Bread $1.98 
I don't know how you interpret that data, but the dollar purchases literally 1/10 of what it used to in most cases and in some, much less.  The average salary today is only about 5x what it was in 1974, so your purchasing power has fallen substantially.  If you held Silver over that same period, you went from $4/oz to $19.
1000 ounces of silver would buy you a car in 1974.  1000 ounces of silver will buy you an equivalent car in 2013.
10000 ounces of silver would buy you a nice house in 1974, it will buy you a decent house today.

This is a syllogistic statement.  You're making the argument that IF assumption "x" happens THEN conclusion "y" will result.  This is proper logic assuming you've defined your assumptions.
For example, "If I drink 20 beers, then I will get a hangover."  You see, I know from experience with beer pong and other stupid drinking games that "If I x (drink too much), then y (hangover) results".  
I have a clearly defined "x" (20 beers).   
Your assumption "x" (bitcoin achieves it's fullest potential) is very unclear, and thus, the idea that your "y" ($100000 price) conclusion will follow is also unclear due to poorly written assumptions.  
Basically, it's terrible logic, because your assumptions are not clearly defined.  If your assumptions aren't defined, your conclusion can't be relied upon.  It's a non sequitor.
What does "bitcoin reaching fullest potential" even mean?  It's as unclear as "moon".  Bitcoin could already be at its fullest potential, or it may NEVER reach it's fullest potential.  In either of those scenarios, your argument falls on it's face.

ATMs made it cheaper for banks to get you money from your account.  They didn't have to pay a teller and could be open all night long.  They provided a benefit to the customer of that bank.  But no, they didn't make dollars more valuable.
My question is simple, why would Bitcoin ATMs be any different? By contrast, bitcoin ATMs don't make it any easier to purchase bitcoin, did you read the thread last week about the ridiculous indentity measures that the Austin bitcoin ATM required?  Because the ATM doesn't know who you are, it required a driver's license and a palm scan, then wait for identity approval before it would give you bitcoin for your $$$.  This isn't a benefit for a customer, these are additional steps and invasions of privacy that would substantially impair BTC adoption by the masses.

Yes, if you already own bitcoins.  My point was that if you do not own bitcoins, it's much cheaper to just use a credit card.  Imagine you don't have bitcoins and are buying something online.  Unless they offer a huge discount for using Bitcoins, there's no additional benefit for you because you don't have to go through the process of converting your fiat to BTC, risking a move in the market, incurring coinbase fees, etc.  
Its simple, I can use a credit card or paypal right now, and not incur any fees as a buyer.  I don't have to link a bank account to a website like MtGox which may or may not give me the coins I pay for in a reasonable timeframe.  If my credit card gets stolen, I don't have to pay the bill and can contest the charges.  If my bitcoins get stolen, well, I'm shit out of luck.
I'm sorry, if you really think that bitcoin has no transaction-costs with all of these issues, then we really have a different understanding of what transaction costs are.

I agree, it's not widely adopted.  But why do bitcoin supporters equate bitcoin adoption with a price increase in BTC?
It's a currency, as such, it's already 100% adopted, every culture has a currency.  Just because more people use your currency, doesn't mean it's worth more.  More people use $s than any other currency, but it doesn't suggest increase in value over time because the $ is inflationary.... The level of adoption doesn't matter.

Historically, there were situations where there was no intermediary financial institution between the employer and employee.... let's just say it didn't always work out well for the employee.
Banks are a 3rd-party entity with one purpose, to smooth financial transactions by providing liquidity when parties don't have the cash to enter a transation.  Think... buying a house.  
I know personally, if I was having financial trouble, I'd rather go to a bank than a loan-shark or employer.  
Bitcoin doesn't really eliminate the need for banks because it doesn't provide liquidity, hell, bitcoins are LIMITED in number and can't be bought/sold on credit (at present).  You can't take a LOAN in BTC so far as I'm aware, because bitcoin is inherently deflationary, so why would anyone ever give a loan in BTC to begin with?  
BTC may (big assumption) replace $s at some point, but it will never replace banking.  Cellphones have subtstantially replaced landlines, but they haven't replaced communication.

But I can just create a new crypto currency.  Gold is an element, that is, it cannot be created.  
Also, Bitcoins by themselves are nothing, they need the blockchain to have value.
Gold, on the other hand, has specific measurable qualities that don't rely on external systems (like a block chain) to still be gold.

Yes, people adopt technology without knowing how it works because... convenience.
A cell phone is convenient because before cell phones, people had to physically travel to a pay phone/landline to call someone else who was sitting next to another landline.  As such, there were three steps to the transaction.  
Old phone paradigm:
1) Go to phone
2) Call person
3) Talk to person
Thus selling adoption of a cellphone to someone new was easy, "you're telling me I can now communicate with other people from anywhere and I can always have the phone with me?  Wow, I couldn't do that before."
New "paradigm" of cellphones:
1) Call person
2) Talk to person
You see, cell phones were adopted because they decreased the steps of the transaction.  You now didn't have to go to a phone, because you had it with you all the time.
With BTC, you're asking them to replace their monetary system, by ADDING a step. 
Current monetary usage:
1) Go to work
2) Paycheck deposited
3) Pay bill
BTC model:
1) Go to work
2) Paycheck deposited
3) Buy Bitcoin (incurring fees, price volatilty, risk)
4) Pay Bill (if the vendor accepts bitcoin, pay cash when they don't)
You see, to the average joe, the benefits of BTC, are greatly outweighed by this additional step (and risk).  Why would anyone sign up for this?

Well, first, they're gonna need electricity, an education system which increases literacy and basic math skills, oh, and you know, a product to sell to obtain Bitcoin in the first place.  
Once they have those things (probably at least a couple generations away for some cultures), then yes, maybe, they'll start utilizing bitcoin as a currency.... that's a pretty big MAYBE.
Those 4-6 Billion people currently live on about $3/day each.  So, hypothetically, if ALL of them put all their money from their work TODAY (assuming they have no expenses for food or shelter) into the Bitcoin marketplace and bought coins, that would add a whopping total of $18B to the market cap of Bitcoin, which would take it from 8B today (I'm feeling generous) up to roughly $26B total new market cap / 12M coins = $2,166/coin.

Haha Jesus.  You don't have the first clue what deflation is.  Deflation is falling prices, prices fall because of supply changes AND demand changes. A deflationary currency impacts demand, not supply, why would you want to keep demand  fixed in your model?


No, that is neither the definition of inflation or deflation.  You actually gave the definition of the money supply.  
Inflation is rising prices, deflation is falling prices.  Its really quite simple. 


It doesn't, because you don't understand simple economic terms.

More people using bitcoins doesn't increase the price, granted, it increases the fees that Coinbase makes, but the price is driven down when people use bitcoin rather than hold bitcoin.  This is the "supply" side of supply and demand. 
Every time a user spends a coin, they are selling it, increasing the supply in circulation.... as the supply in circulation increases, the market price falls.  If the merchant (you konw those pesky businesses that we can't expect to "do it for us") immediately sell their coins to coinbase (who gets another fee), thats yet another supply increase of coins a coinbase, who will lower their price to entice another buyer.

Bitcoin is a technological advancement.  You really can't think of a plausible scenario when a technology is obsoleted by a newer better technology and the result is that the previous technology is now essentially worthless?
How about 8-tracks, cassette tapes, CDs, MP3s laserdiscs, BetaMax, DVDs, rotary phones?  
Horse buggies, steam-engine trains? Wood-fired stoves? Kodak film? 
Sure, they have "collector" value to some niche folks, but generally, their market capitalization has become non-material to society.
The "plausible scenario" you don't seem to think exists happens all around us, everyday, when new solutions are created.
Bitcoin is a technology, it can easily be obsoleted.  To think otherwise, is to ignore what allowed Bitcoin's previous rise.  a 100% loss is not only plausible, but, dare I say it... probable, because of innovation.

Yep, and having a "day where we spend at retailers who accept them" isn't exactly making people sound serious about BTC.  
If you want to make BTC a serious financial instrument, you shouldn't have to cheerlead folks to use it.  Consider epicurean logic as it applies to bitcoin.
Epicurean logic ---- If bitcoin is so revolutionary, why would we need to butter-up retailers who accept it?  If bitcoin isn't revolutionary, then why use it at all when you could just use cash?  Therefore, the fact that this thread is requesting that users SPEND their coins in appreciation to motivate retailers is proof that bitcoin shouldn't be used at all.

in other words, I don't have eyes to see or ears to hear.


I know right, it's almost like Christians who can't believe that someone wouldn't follow their religion when it's so much better than other religions you can choose from.
If you really want to know, for one, bitcoin isn't a company so comparing it to a company's valuation seems kinda... i dunno.... retarded, like comparing apples to oranges.  
If you really wanted to compare it's valuation to another currency or commodity, that would make more sense.  Even then, it's used by about 2M people on earth max (I'd say that's a generous number), which represent well less than 1% of people on earth, so the idea that bitcoin has a low relative value to currencies or commodities used by everyone makes absolute sense.

I did, I noted very clearly that the graph from 1820 - 2000 includes a time period 1913-2000 when the dollar was inflationary, and as such, is a terrible example of the "success of a deflationary currency".  See below, since I guess you didn't read it the first time.


You then write:


Not an accurate statement, I really think you have inflation/deflation mixed up.  If the $ had been deflationary for the last 100 years, a house today would probably be cheaper than a house in 1913, that's how deflation works.

If you regulate it, the market will respond, and you may not like the response.

@_date: 2014-09-10 20:58:02


Try this, I write a program to create individual wallets for every Filipino citizen (there's about 100M of them).  I take 1BTC and divide it equally among each wallet so each person get's 1 satoshi.  I then send everyone access to their newly created wallets.  Assume for the purposes of this example that 1) no filipino uses bitcoin and 2) everyone excitedly goes online and accepts their newly created wallet.
I've just increased the adoption of BTC usage from me, 1 person to 100M people (this is actually a much larger increase than you required).  Please, paint me a picture why the price would suddenly increase in this scenario?  No additional wealth has been put into BTC, but the user base has been expanded.

Overstock is apparently holding 5%... that's not exactly a glowing endorsement.  
And when you consider their margins and savings on CC fees, that 5% they're saving in BTC is probably the difference between what they would've paid to Visa instead of what they pay to coinbase.  They're literally making the same amount of margin $s on the sale but saving the extra bitcoins just in case of a price move.  It's called "playing with house money," it doesn't denote some grand approval of BTC as a legitimate currency.

Actually, the idea that the borrower can "earn enough to cover it" to afford the 2% interest when they borrow with a deflationary currency is the biggest flaw in the bitcoincirclejerk.  
You would never borrow money from someone with interest if it was deflationary, as your real effective interest rate just increases over time.  It's an ARM that always goes up.
Think about it, I borrow that .5BTC from you, you've looked at my salary and see that i make .15 BTC per year (most mortgages are given out if the person can makes 25%-30% of the total value of the home annually).  
Let's say you charge 2% interest per year, so in a 30 year mortgage, that means I owe you .01BTC interest and .016BTC principal (to pay off the house in 30 years.  My total annual house payment is .0267payment/.15salary = 17.8% of my salary.
Seems great in the first year, right?  
Well, next year, I owe the same nominal payment in our mortgage agreement .0267BTC, only BTC has depreciated yet again (because it's designed this way), as such, instead of a "raise" at work, I get my cost-of-living adjustment resulting in less BTC than the year before, so now I make .14BTC/year.  My new payment this year is .0267/.14 = 19% of my salary.
Next year it gets worse, and worse every year after that.  By the 13th year, my house costs 100% of my take home salary.  Of course, I would already have moved out, because I couldn't feed my family.  
You as the banker get to foreclose on the house and try to sucker in the next buyer.  This lending lasts about 2 years before people realize that they're getting poorer every year and they just stop making payments.
Deflationary currency and long-term lending don't play nice, this is why bankers like inflationary currency.

Well.. to obtain BTC you have to pay a fee from a seller like Coinbase (about 1% usually) or go on Circle with no fees, all while risking your bank account getting shut down or identity stolen (not exactly anonymous when you have to have all your personal info verified).  Once you've waited and received BTC you have to log onto Gyft, pay them Bitcoin, wait for confirmation, and keep track of your gift card email (putting even more personal info out there for our hacker friends).  Then log onto Amazon, put the item in cart, fill out the discount code and pay.  All the while, you're incurring the price volatility of BTC which could substantially rise or fall during your holding period.  Then, you have to calculate your taxable gain/loss during this holding period up until the moment of purchase so that you're cool with the IRS.
I could simply 1-click order.  
Less price volatility risk, less steps in the process, no tax implications, and I have recourse if a seller sends a damaged product.  I get none of those things with BTC... and it takes me much less time.
Yeah, that 6% isn't looking so hot now.  Some of us value our time a little more than others.  Convenience has value.  Bitcoin is not convenient, at all.
Edit: Because as I thought about the transaction more, I realized even more risk and ridiculousness in the Bitcoin purchase process.

No, therein lies one of the greatest problems with bitcoin.  By going smaller, you have to lower the price of an item (deflate).  However, many items we buy, last longer than one day, so this would get really annoying, and even more annoying the bigger the purchase.
For example, let's assume a standard 3bedroom/2bath house in a midsized city in the US. Let's assume that the purchasing value of Bitcoin doubles (we've already seen it do much more than this) every 5 years. I open up zillow.com and find a realtor who shows me where and we go buy the following house:
2015 house price = 2000 BTC
5 years later 2020 house price = 1000 BTC
10 years later 2025 house price = 500 BTC
15 years later 2030 house price = 250 BTC
20 years later 2035 house price = 125 BTC
25 years later 2040 house price = 75 BTC
Let's assume I die, and leave my kid the house worth 75 BTC, instead of 2000 BTC if I just held. 
Why the fuck, would I ever buy a house in a deflationary bitcoin dystopia?  Answer, I wouldn't, and neither would you, it would be the worst financial mistake of your life.

I think you missed my point. I'm aware that on most exchanges you don't have direct market access. Bitcoin is supposed to be different, it's supposed to allow the user to be independent of the banking system through a decentralized network.  In contrast, this centralized trading platform with the money and organization to effectively control the price of bitcoin, makes it much less attractive as a currency.
@_date: 2014-01-16 21:27:53


No, it's the opposite of what you say.  If this year a company received 100BTC in sales revenue and the "value" of BTC goes up next year by double, then next year they could make 50BTC and have the same utility (buying power).  Their REVENUE, however, decreased by 50%, but their buying power stayed the same.  As such, their financials would look absolutely terrible year over year not because of anything they had done, but because the currency had increased in value.

How does BTC prevent asset bubbles?
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:05:19
1) The consumer takes on the risk of holding a volatile asset.
2) The consumer takes on the risk of bitcoins being stolen
3) They still have to have the item shipped to their house or other location where they could be easily traced, it's not as "anonymous" as you would think.
4) TIL you can buy something on Overstock.com and have it shipped outside the us... oh wait... nope, you cant.
The only loser here is the customer who has to incur fees to purchase bitcoins, then as they hold bitcoins watch the value decrease.  If it was working, we'd see a more positive bitcoin price trend.  But for 6 months now, price is steadily falling... that's 10% of the time that bitcoins have been in existence.

It also ignores that 60% of the treasury notes are owned by US states and municipalities.  That is, we can eliminate 60% of our national debt by simply having states and cities forgive the debt from the US gov't.  It's not really that big of a deal.
Our real problem is unfunded liabilitites relating to entitlement programs.

@_date: 2014-03-27 13:18:56


Except, you know, creating a huge realized gain just by participating in a "day to day" transaction.
For example, if I buy a shirt on Overstock for 0.05BTC, I didn't just pay .05BTC (let's call that $25 worth of BTC), I created a taxable liability for myself.  If I bought the bitcoin when it was $1, that means at the time my .05BTC cost me $0.05, because of my transaction, I now owe taxes on the gains of that .05BTC since my purchase, which works out to a 500x gain in value, as such, along with buying the shirt, I owe a nominal taxable amount of $24.95*(15% capital gains rate) or $3.75.  This is $3.75 that I have to pay out of pocket in fiat on a .05BTC purchase.  
Oh, and btw, I have to do this retroactively, so there are a lot of folks that are going get slammed.  I don't even want to think about the people who bought Teslas and shit like that.
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:04:39


Really?  So if we eliminate Coinbase, will Overstock still accept Bitcoin?
If not, then we need to be honest with ourselves and realize that Bitcoin isn't a currency, but a payment method like a credit card, and so long as we use third party intermediaries (Coinbase), then we aren't being revolutionary because we're relying on a MIDDLEMAN to make the transaction work.

Not really a concern, because well before that, the deflationary nature of bitcoin would cause power companies to stop producing power so there won't be any mining anyway.
Think of it this way.  I'm a power company and I charge someone 1BTC this year for power.  I use this 1BTC to pay my expenses in my business, which include my employees and materials.  Let's say this costs .9BTC, that leaves a .1BTC profit.
Normally, I would use this profit to invest in my company, only now, I know that next year, that .1BTC will get more valuable, so I just hoard it, removing BTC from the money supply.
In the meantime, I still need to produce electricity for my customers, but because the currency has deflated, their companies are paying them less.  Since the money supply is smaller, I can't charge as much for the same power, so this year, I can only charge .9BTC to the customers, which means I have to pay my employees less and buy less materials to secure a profit.  This keeps happening year over year.  If only there was more coins, but alas, they've been hoarded long ago.
Eventually, given enough time, I just turn off the turbines and shut my doors, because it becomes impossible to run a business for profit.
Then the lights go off around town and all the miners are shut down.  So like I said, no worries on incentivizing miners, they're ability to mine will cease to exist long before their incentive fails.
@_date: 2014-01-16 21:19:04


AGREED, and thanks for illustrating my point. The key word there is CASH.  In that case, they're not using BTC as currency, but rather, as a payment method (a cheaper version of a credit-card).  
The currency is still the $ because they move out of BTC into $ to protect themselves from swings in BTC. That's what you do with commodities, not currencies.

No, you do not understand intrinsic value.  The intrinsic value of silver is the value it possesses in its own right, as an end-in-itself.  That is, if you remove the currency/monetary value transacted in silver, it's still a physical element with specific properties used in industry (like electronics/medical devices) and as such, can never have zero value.  It has intrinsic value. 
Bitcoins, on the other hand, as you say "are made of blockchain."  If you remove Bitcoins as a currency or payment method, you claim the blockchain gives them intrinsic value.  However, the blockchain without the use of BTC as a currency is worthless.  No one will use a blockchain to record a transaction, if the transaction was recorded in another currency. 
I just bought a coffee with $, I was able to do this without ever entering a transaction on the blockchain.  Where is the intrinsic value to me of the blockchain in this transaction?  If no one transacts in bitcoins, the blockchain is not valuable because it won't record anything.
By contrast, I cannot build a more efficient heat conductor than something made of silver, because it's an elemental trait that can't be taken away.  You can take away silver as a currency, but you can't take away it's ability to have the highest thermoconductivity of any element.  That is intrinsic value, it's ok that BTC doesn't have any intrinsic value, we just need to be honest with ourselves when we talk about BTC or people won't take us seriously.
Edit: spelling and shit.
@_date: 2014-01-21 20:53:12


Just to clarify, you're saying that because I have not proven that Silver is intrinsically valuable, as such, I can't prove that Bitcoin is precluded from having intrinsic value?
I admit, I've been bested, you win, I'll admit silver has no intrinsic value.  As such, BTC must also have no intrinsic value, glad we agree on that.
Oh, just a note, I posted BTC had no intrinsic value in my original post, so I was half right, I appreciate you taking the time set me straight on my misunderstanding of Silver.
I guess now we have to focus on the bigger problem, all the BTC users who think their coins have intrinsic value and as such, are deluding themselves.

This is where you're mistaken.  If every Dow stock was going down tomorrow but you could know which one was dropping the least, that would be the one to hold.  A "hold" rating doesn't tell you anything about whether or not value of that asset will increase, it tells you whether that asset will increase in value relative other assets.
A buy rating, hold rating, and sell rating are comparing all different investments to each other in the same bucket.  A single investment, in this case Bitcoin, cannot be more than one rating for an individual.  You and I may value it differently, but individually we can't say, "well, it's a buy and a sell" ... that would be nonsense.
A "hold" rating, typically means that the expectation of value increase falls in the middle of available investments.  That is, if you already have a position, hold onto that position but there is no reason to buy it or sell it because the macrofactors are not substantial enough to merit a clear decision.  If you don't have a position, don't waste your time buying in.  If you were going to sell the investment, you should wait to do so.

As such, if you're a company who measures its sales revenue in BTC, then you will make less REVENUE next year if BTC increases in value relative to the $ or yuan or whatever.  Instead of 100BTC this year, next year you make 50BTC, because of the "value" increase through deflation.
As such, your financial statements to wall street will read like this: "Amazon's annual revenue fell by 50% this year, but everything is cool, because, you know, we use BTC now."

Yes, this is subjectivity because it's a situation that requires the use of a specific item by a specific person, as i noted earlier, intrinsic value is the "value it possesses in its own right, as an end-in-itself"  and you're attempting to use a hypothetical situation where the silver could be exchanged for any amount of water to save a person OUTSIDE of the element. You're giving a subjective example to prove that something doesnt' have intrinsic value, as such, your logic is flawed, horribly.


Ag's thermoconductivity compared to other elements is specific and measurable regardless of whether or not someone values it.  That's what intrinsic means.  It is INTRINSIC, it doesn't care what people think about the value or if they even think about it at all, it just IS it's nature.

That's actually pretty similar ot the money making system for pretty much any investment.  The only difference, is that instead of "wait a while" you typically "add value".
For example, I buy a house.  Then I add a new deck on the back and update the kitchen.  Then I sell the house for more than I invested in the house.
The difference with bitcoin, is that most people don't add any value to bitcoin.  Most bitcoins just sit on paper wallets inactive.  There's no value added.

People compare bitcoin to the internet in terms of it's revolutionariness. But I think this comparison is lacking because bitcoin is a currency.  Currency has already been adopted by 100% of society.  This has been the case for thousands of years.
100% Adoption has already occurred, BTC is attempting to improve on currency (in many ways, I think it does), but the demand for currency is not going to change, regardless of BTC.
If all people replace their currency with another currency, it doesn't change their capacity for wealth substantially. A goat farmer is still a goat farmer no matter whether they use bitcoin or $s

Let's say there is a financial collapse and the $ fails.... I guess that all of the sudden, assets owned by companies become worthless, right? Nope.  
If your wealth is in stock, it's NOT in currency, so a failure of the $ doesn't mean you lose wealth.  Companies will still be profitable no matter what currency they use.  Coca-Cola makes money all over the world in lots of different currencies, many of which have failed, yet, stock in coca-cola has paid dividends steadily since 1920.  
BTC is a payment method because it's buying power is measured by the local currency.  Owning BTC is not an investment, it's a gift card.  It might appreciate, it might not, but you're reliant on the local currency instead of something tangible, like a factory.
I personally own BTC for kicks, but I own stock for wealth-generation.  I also own land (about 300 acres), I don't really care what the $ is doing, because the land is still LAND, no matter what currency it's traded in.  
Enjoy your collapse, I hope the internet works and people accept digital currencies in a true collapse fantasy.

The more utility something has, the higher the relative intrinsic value, can we agree on that?  
If you are making a sharpening tool, hardness matters very much to the sharpening tool's utility (ability to make something sharp). If you use materials that aren't hard, you can't sharpen as effectively.  Quartz sharpeners don't work as well as diamond sharpeners no matter what the cost.  
Since it's the hardness of the diamond that helps it give more utility and thus more value, it's not hard to see that the property (hardness) has increased the value.

Yes, you are missing something, a basic understanding of economics.  If demand for btc is not impacted by an event, the price won't move.  If the demand is impacted, the price will move.  
Tiger direct is an online marketplace where you can buy something denominated in $ with bitcoins or just use a credit card for the same price. There is no impact to demand for BTC because there is no incentive for anyone who doesn't own BTC to go out and buy any just because TD accepts it now. 
Conversely, seeing a founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation and one of the pivotal voices of the currency arrested does negatively affect demand because it gives people an incentive not to hold an asset associated with illicit activity.  Hence, price drop.

That 11 months represents 20% of the entire life of BTC.. during that time it has been decreasing in value... actually the number is more than that, because the life of BTC is getting longer and the price is going lower... the 4 years of growth prior are long gone, the trend has turned, and everyone here knows it, only a few have the guts to admit it.
The trend is down, and heading further down... every new low we see the same thing "this is it, last chance to get cheap coins", then a month later, they're $50-100 cheaper.... at least, until everyone gets out.

Generally I thought the article was poorly written, but he makes some valid points that many folks here seem to dismiss without ever answering.
He writes - "The monetary system should effectively be invisible to the economy. The monetary system is like the oil in an engine, it isn't part of the engine but it enables the whole system to run smoothly. You never really think of the oil until you run out of it and when you do, the engine crashes.  A successful virtual currency must be stable if it is going to be a success."
This is one of the things I agree with in the article.  Bitcoin is a phenomenal payment method and is beginning to be used by many well-known vendors. However, as a currency, Bitcoin is still failing miserably because the vendors aren't holding Bitcoins or pricing items in terms of Bitcoin, they're just accepting it for payment like they would if you used a gift card. In the merchant's eyes, they're getting $$$, even if you pay in Bitcoin.  As such, it's not a currency at all.
Consider the "engine oil" analogy the author uses, it applies well.  If I want to buy something like a tank of gas (on the front page of r/bitcoin right now) with cash, 1) I just go to the ATM and get cash, 2) pump gas, 3) hand cashier cash, and 4) drive away.  If I want to pay for the same gas in bitcoin, I have to 1) go to the bank and get cash 2) find a seller on localbitcoins.com 3) meet seller and exchange cash for bitcoin 4)pump gas, 5) pay cashier in bitcoin, 6)drive away.  Do I get some huge discount for using Bitcoin?  If not, what's to motivate me to go through all the extra steps?  Which scenario is smoother? Which scenario is more convenient?  Which one "oils" the engine better?  Let's be honest with ourselves.
This is why the price of bitcoin doesn't really change when a new vendor like overstock.com accepts it, because they're not actually holding or using bitcoin.  It's too scary for them to hold it due to it's inelasticity and volatility.  
Until major vendors begin to pay employees in bitcoin and pricing goods in bitcoin, there's really no advantage to it as a currency.... because simply, it's not used as a currency.
In the meantime, I will acknowledge it provides great utility as a payment method.  There is value there, definitely, but so long as it's not treated as a currency by all parties of a transaction, it will never usurp our banking system.
edit: spelling and such

Tomorrow you will feel terrible, but you will feel better than the guy who spent $20 on bitcoin only to pay fees to watch the value of your investment go away with increased merchant adoption.

Get ready for downvotes.  This is the largest flaw of the current bitcoin system that most people here would rather ignore and downvote than actually address.  
Coinbase and bitpay are the greatest threat to Bitcoin's adoption as a currency because their entire goal is to keep businesses from using Bitcoin as currency in the first place.  They are actually hindering the adoption of bitcoin on a large scale because businesses (like overstock) are not choosing to use BTC in their business model at all, they're just converting back to fiat and coinbase/bitpay take their percentage.  Overstock isn't buying inventory in bitcoin, paying employees in bitcoin, they're not even holding it as currency.  
In this system, paying for something in Bitcoin is literally no different than paying with an overstock.com gift card except that tomorrow your "bitcoin prepaid card" could be worth 10% more or less depending on how many CEOs of Bitcoin based companies have been arrested on this particular day.
The overstock/tiger direct transaction has no additional value (savings) to the customer or the merchant (maybe a bit on CC fees, but this isn't revolutionary, it's just a more efficient cc payment system), the only real value is being captured by coinbase/bitpay who would never have received any cash from the transaction prior to the "acceptance" of bitcoin.  
Coinbase and Bitpay are literally parasitic, they only profit if companies DON'T use bitcoin as currency.  Yet people here treat them as if they are doing us all a great favor.
If this continues, the early adopters will get some cheap PS4s and such in the short term, but long term, no one is going to keep buying bitcoins if they could just use a debit card and avoid the hassle of waiting for coinbase, security risks, currency volatility.  Coinbase and Bitpay will make some short term profits for their shareholders, but Bitcoin will never be adopted unless people use it as currency, instead of a prepaid gift card.

No, mortgage payments, by nature, generally are not designed to change monthly.  Certain mortgages adjust for interest rates (ARMs), but the principal due each month never changes.  If you get a mortgage in BTC, you will have to pay a specific amount every month for the duration of the loan.  If next year, you're paid half the BTC you got this year, your mortgage payment doesn't change with it.
As such, no bank would ever give a mortgage as we know it in BTC, as no buyer would be able to demonstrate the ability to pay it back.  
A world without credit would be a pretty terrible world.

Well, seems legit, considering almost no one here uses BTC as currency.  
Sure, people pay for something on Overstock.com that's denominated in $ so they think they're being revolutionary.  But let's follow the transaction, from overstock, the bitcoins get sent to coinbase, who immediately reimburses overstock.com in cash.  Then coinbase sells the bitcoins back to a buyer, for cash.  What's the common theme in all of these interactions?  Oh, yeah, cash, the actual currency.
What Bitcoin is, is a a payment method, like a prepaid gift card.  You pay your $ (currency) for a product (bitcoin prepaid card), then use that prepaid card to buy things denominated in $ from a vendor who will never hold Bitcoin. 
It's not revolutionary, it's just a prepaid Visa, with a ton of volatility.

The author doesn't prove bitcoins have intrinsic value, he says that "nothing has intrinsic value".  He talks about dimishing marginal utility (a glass of water when you are stuck in the desert being worth more than a glass of water when you are sitting in a pool) and claims that because any asset has diminishing marginal utility  that there is no intrinsic value anywhere.  I agree that diminishing marginal utility exists.
However, I'd argue, that diminishing marginal utility and intrinsic value are not so causative, because of substitutes.
To a diabetic, no price is too high for insulin if you are low on sugar.  There is literally nothing else you could give the person for them to survive, there are no substitutes.  Hence, insulin has intrinsic value in this example.  To me (a non-diabetic) insulin has no intrinsic value, in any scenario.  Does this mean that because of my immediate lack of utility that the item has no intrinsic value, period?  No.
Bitcoins, by contrast, are pieces of a distributed ledger.  The ledger can be replaced by other ledgers that perform the equivalent task with little or no additional costs (think Litecoin).  That is, there are plenty of substitutes for Bitcoin, that can do what they do easily.  This gives bitcoin an extremely low (if any) intrinsic value.  As noted, the author never proved that bitcoin has intrinsic value, he just wanted to prove that nothing has intrinsic value, so he agrees with me on Bitcoin lacking it.

When a big new merchant decides to accept Visa, it can affect the stock price of Visa.  When Visa is able to demonstrate that this new vendor is creating wealth for Visa's shareholders through transactions, the stock price rises because the demand for ownership of Visa increases.  
By comparison, Bitcoin isn't really a stock, so even adoption by a vendor is not indicative of market demand for Bitcoin.  Demand for Bitcoin determines it's relative value in the marketplace since the supply of bitcoin is relatively fixed.  Just because a vendor accepts it, doesn't mean that the market demands more bitcoins than are currently available for sale.
Also, Bitcoin is different than Visa in a couple other ways.  One, it's a payment method for which there are barriers to entry for the average person when compared to just using cash at a vendor.  For example, it's easier to get $$$ from your employer than to be paid in Bitcoin.  It's also easier to get a credit card because those companies profit from your business, whereas Bitcoin is not a sentient profit-seeker like Visa, and as such, has no incentive for you to use it.
Second, Bitcoin claims to be a currency, which in the eyes of the "big" retailers you speak of, it is decidedly not.  They aren't pricing goods in Bitcoin or buying inventory in Bitcoin, they immediately convert it to $.  As such, Bitcion isn't a currency at all, but a payment method because the big retailers you speak of aren't using it as such.
Right now, when you buy Bitcoin, you're buying 1/12millionth ownership of the payment method, you are not buying currency.  If you think of it this way, the price of Bitcoin being flat while the demand for Bitcoins is also flat, seems incredibly reasonable.

It's statements like this that make me nervous.  You've made a statement as if it is a given fact, but you have not supported it with evidence.  The statement makes two assertions 1) that volatility has decreased... and 2) this decrease was attributable to wider adoption.
What proof do you have that volatility is decreased?  Over what lengh of time?  How did you measure it? What were your givens/assumptions?
Secondly, you make the assertion that this decreased volatility is attributable to wider adoption. What regression analysis did you perform on this decrease in volatility which determined that the causal variable of this decrease was the increase in "adoption"?  You haven't even defined what you mean by "adoption" much less proven a causal link.
If you haven't proven this statement, then the remainder of your argument is unsound.  You follow the unfounded statement by noting:
 


You see, you're doing what I'm talking about earlier, it's a circular argument. You haven't proven your first statement as fact, but are already inferring that the second statement results from the first.

The fact that you don't see me as a Bitcoin "user" because I don't buy crap I don't need on NewEgg doesn't make me any less of a member of the Bitcoin community.  You need people like me to keep hodling to keep the value relatively stable.  
Remember BearWhale?  He/She "USED" Bitcoin and caused a pretty substantial impact to the marketplace.  Be careful what you wish for.
A couple years ago I put some of my cash into bitcoin to USE it as a store of wealth and a potential investment vehicle for my future.  So far my USE of Bitcoin in this manner has been quite profitable.

Wow a response to every line, without a single useful response to any line.... 
first you blame the banking system instead of addressing the difficulty issue
Then you blame the author for apparently not understanding the simplicity of the creation of bitcoins instead of explaining it.
Then you illustrate that there are arbitration services out there... and fail to list any.
Then you agree that it's deflationary, but fail to address how and why this is ok, you just note that it's a fact.
Then you talk about how all the problems have been solved, without giving any examples... 
This is truly helpful for any potential future user of bitcoin.

Yes, I'm looking at  which shows a fairly static daily average transaction.  Whereas over the same time, thousands of new vendors are accepting bitcoin.  As such, we can deduce that more vendors accepting isn't making people use bitcoins more.  What does this tell us?  It tells us that Bitcoin is not a currency, because given the opportunity, people aren't using it as such.
@_date: 2014-01-16 21:16:09


Not what i said at all.  I'm talking about company owner's response to receiving less revenue annually if they use BTC as a currency.  We exist in a growth paradigm.  Our society is growing, as such, we have to produce more every year to keep up with a growing population's needs (food/shelter/etc).  If your company (let's say they make houses) is getting 1BTC for a house this year and has to spend 0.8BTC to buy the inventory for the materials for the next year's house, they still need to sell the house for 1BTC to make the profit to pay their employees and keep the company open.  Since BTC are limited, that means the cost of things in BTC continues to fall (deflate) indefinitely.  If the price of a house is 0.5BTC next year, they just won't build the house, and the company goes under.

Congrats, now that is an assumption we can work with!
Your new argument is as follows:


I actually think you might be a bit low in your estimate / hear me out.  
There are currently about 7B people on the planet, so 2.5B using bitcoin would equate to about 36% of the global economy.  The global output is currently measured at about $85T 
As such, 36% of $85T would give a Bitcoin global value of $30.4T.  Divide that by the expected number of coins (lets' say 14M to give a little time for this adoption to occur) gives an expected value of $2.1M per coin, or about 21x your original estimate.  Seems legit.
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:58:02
Think about today as an example.  Yesterday, you eaked into the store and scheduled a delivery today when 1BTC was $1k. Today the delivery truck gets here and goes to install the fridge and it doesn't fit so you send it back.  The store refunds you $777 because of the price drop today.  
You're pissed.  Really pissed.

Well, at least you conveniently ignored the rest of the response.
Good on you for not ever regretting a purchase in bitcoin because of a price move due to your unlimited ability to replenish your funds.  I hope you never make a BTC purchase that you can't simply refill your wallet with cash on hand in a bank account.  
Also, don't you realize that if you're just replenishing by using fiat to buy bitcoins that all you're doing in reality is just buying a "prepaid gift card" made of bitcoins?  You're just using bitcoin for transactions, but the value of them is still derived from your cash.  There's nothing revolutionary about using a gift card.  Not only that, but this "prepaid gift card" come loaded with financial risk.

Yes, and guess what, this is the problem, because if you bought your car Tuesday and replenished Wednesday, it cost you 20% more to do so.  That's insanely risky.  Imagine buying a house.  Could you just "replenish" BTC for a purchase like a house?  You can probably make that purchase once or twice in your life, you don't have cash to just replenish immediately for large purchases, that's why they're called "large purchases".  
It's not "the old deflation argument" it's a deflation fact.  Bitcoin deflated by over 20% in one day, we just watched it happen.
Anyone who bought something they could've waited one day and gotten 20% more value would be kicking themselves for not simply waiting.  As such, knowing this could happen, many folks will choose to wait for purchases.

I don't really think it's that high.  
More than 50% settle all of their Bitcoin  payments in cash.  Of the remainder that settle in both cash and bitcoin it's not clear what percentage of the settlement is cash vs. bitcoin.  This could mean it's actually a very tiny amount.
For example, if I'm a merchant and someone gives me $100 worth of BTC and I settle for $99 cash from Bitpay and $1 worth of Bitcoin, I'd make the list of "merchants who accept settlements in bitcion" even though I was only taking 1% of the total.

My argument doesn't pass muster?  I argue that it can't save the world from a few elites overusing resources at the expense of others and give examples why Bitcoin doesn't stop this, you haven't shown how giving the poor bitcoin will remove them from poverty.
You mention that giving the unbanked access to bitcoin will somehow save them.  I'll one-up you, let's just give everyone on earth an equal share of bitcoin... 12Million coins / 7Billion = .0017BTC per person.
Now, let's consider that bitcoin represents 1/10,000 of global wealth which is a gross overestimation.  Global wealth is estimated at $220T dollars.  1/10,000 of that is $22B.  Divide that by 12M will give you a value/BTC of $1,833 (this illustrates how favorable i'm treating bitcoin since it's $ value is roughly 1/3 of this amount).  Now multiply that by .0017BTC / person which gives you a $ wealth to every person on the planet of $3.12.   
Everyone has equal bitcoins now, is the world saved?  No, in fact, in that scenario, it actually is close to about 70% of earth's population's daily wage.  I'd also argue that within a few months, you'd have income inequity all over again, as you say:


You disprove yourself right there.  Bitcoin can't solve the problem that the study finds to be the major driver for collapse.  Bitcoin is not the savior in this scenario because you'll still have profit-seeking occuring in the marketplace.  As such, there will be winners and losers, even if everyone starts off with the same wealth.
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:13:54


No, I come out behind, even moreso as this is retroactive.  I didn't get CASH for my bitcoins, I never had the dollars to begin with, nor did I realize them in some type of sale.  I got other products/services because I used Bitcoins as the currency.
I'm being forced to pay $3.75 that I never held.
When you buy a stock and it appreciates, you sell it for cash.  You use this cash to pay taxes and then reinvest elsewhere.  CGT is no biggie here.
With Bitcoin, if you're a miner, then you owe the $ value + employee FICA tax of 6.2% of the value of the bitcoin at the time it was mined, even if you don't convert it to cash.

Actually, gold's value to resources has remained pretty consistent over the years.  A nice house in 1913 would cost you about $2000, or 100 ozs of gold.  Today, a nice house will cost you about $250,000, or 100ozs of gold. 
Gold is also held in vaults, it's not "lost" like Bitcoins that go dormant. Bitcoin is designed to become less and less available over time, meaning it's purchasing power should rise, whereas, Gold pretty much stays the same.
They are not the same assets.

Actually, economics doesn't agree with you.  You're claiming that more ATMs (an increase in supply of access) will result in an increase in the demand curve for BTC, thus resulting in a higher price.  
Let's use shoes as an example.  Let's say that on every street corner, you can buy shoes because new vendors are popping up everywhere (increasing the supply of access to shoes), does this mean that suddenly you want another pair of shoes?  Not exactly. 
Does it make the shoes more valuable now that you can get them anywhere?  Not exactly.
There is not a causal relationship between more ATMs (increased supply) resulting in increased demand for bitcoin.  That is why supply and demand curves are separate on a graph.  The point where they reach equilibrium is the price.  Increasing just the supply (more ATMs) without impacting the demand actually results in a LOWER price.

The original post that I replied to said to:


My point is simple, those sales the original poster is blathering about are denominated in $$$, not Bitcoin, because Bitcoin isn't a currency in this business model, it's a payment method, like a credit card or gift card.  
The businesses are not using the actual Bitcoins for anything, they're exchanging them immediately  for cash.  This is no different than how they remit cash from Visa/Mastercard, a buyer buys a PS4, pays with a Visa card, then Tigerdirect sends Visa a bill which they pay in cash (minus a fee).  In the overstock.com and tigerdirect models, BTC is just a payment method, the product is denominated in $, they take the market $/BTC rate, then Tigerdirect and overstock.com are remitted in $ from coinbase (minus a fee). Then tiger/overstock use $$$$ NOT BTC to buy more inventory and pay their employees.  
Tigerdirect and overstock aren't using Bitcoins as currency at all, as such, the idea of growing adoption is a lie you're telling yourself to feel better, because no one new is using BTC in this model.  When the transaction is complete, the BTC have moved from the buyer to coinbase. They're not making it to the vendors of tiger/overstock or to the employees of these companies... 
I have owned BTC for awhile, and I'm watching it turn FROM a currency  INTO just a prepaid gift card with tons of volatility thanks to Coinbase and Bitpay.

Actually, when my parents passed away, they did leave me some money, it wasn't a trust fund then, but a life insurance payout.  That money now sits in a trust for my children, I didn't need it, so I didn't use it.  If I teach them about the power of compounding, hopefully they don't have to worry about money either.  So, you're right in a sense, although I'm not a trustafundian, I'm the father of some.
My father told me almost 40 years ago, "If you don't understand compound interest, you pay it.  If you understand compound interest, it pays you."
The problem with BTC generally is that unless you are a miner, you can't earn a dividend with BTC.  You can't grow your holdings unless you buy with cash.  Of course, that means, the REAL currency is $s and BTC is simply a payment method because you'll always price the item in $s and not BTC.  BTC is just like buying a pre-paid giftcard instead of stock in a company.  
People who bought 20BTC last year, have 20BTC today that buys 1/3 of what it bought 12 months ago (the gift card lost value).  If you bought 20 shares of GE last year, today you'd have about 21 shares thanks to their dividend... and price appreciation to boot.

BTC is not designed to be stable.  It is deflationary by nature as the supply is fixed.  The more folks who want to use it the greater the demand. As such, the value per coin can only go up over time.  
There is no price stability unless it fails as a currency because companies like coinbase keep btc out of merchant hands making BTC nothing more than gift cards. .

Please explain how this would change anything?  
Sure, early adopters would benefit because they'd now get to buy stuff on Amazon with the Bitcoin they couldn't otherwise liquidate.  Amazon sends their bitcoin to Coinbase instantly, and get's cash.  Meanwhile, Coinbase pockets 1% from Amazon and another 1% when they resell at the market price. 
Oh, yeah, and there's a news report talking about it for all of 5 minutes.
But why would someone who doesn't hold Bitcoin suddenly convert their fiat when they can keep using their Amazon Prime account that is linked to their bank account?  It's not like they're suddenly being paid in BTC and will want to pay with it.  What is the reason to change your current spending habits if you are a non-bitcoiner?
Unless Amazon was offering deep discounts for products paid for in bitcoin and using those bitcoins earned to pay vendors and employees, I see nothing that would merit an increase in price of BTC.  Perhaps you can educate me as to how this would be any different than today.

You can't lend BTC, because its deflationary.  No one would take out a loan that gets more expensive pay back over time.  One reason people will buy a house with a mortgage, is that over time, the inflation of the $ devalues the remaining debt.  
By contrast, the deflationary nature of bitcoin would make the loan harder and harder to pay back.

merchants "accepting" bitcoin means very different things... 
1) accepting it as payment and using it to buy other things like labor or inventory
2) accepting is as payment and converting to the $value immediately
One of those models is a currency, one is not.  One of those models is a game changer because it unseats centralized currency replacing it with a new decentralized currency. 
The other model is just a "prepaid gift card".

The OP puts a cash value on Bitcoin, much like a cash value on a stock price.  
A lot of Bitcoin users believe bitcoin is already a currency or piece of ownership of the protocol.  As such, attributing a $ cash price is irrational, like putting a Gold price on a new car ("this car costs 15 oz of gold").  I consider each of my coins to be 1/12,000,XXX ownership of the protocol, not a $ value.  As such, it's not that I don't care what the IRS says, it's just that I don't plan to ever convert coins back to fiat, as such, there won't be realized $ gains to tax.
It's not really a libertarian thing, it's more of an ownership mindset.  As we don't own our financial system in America (because the Fed can increase/decrease the money supply without voting support), we're just not used to the idea that we are part owners of the sum total of wealth.
If this mindset changes and bitcoin is adopted, the IRS won't be able to tax bitcoin at all, because it's deflationary to begin with.  You can't tax something that's deflationary with a progressive % tax system, because every year, you'll get less nominal revenue but gov't expenses will remain constant due to fixed-bid contracts.  
That is, the gov't literally can't work if their supply of money is decreasing, they know this, and will do whatever they can to maintain the status quo.

I was actually being serious, not trolling.  I thought you were trolling.  
How can you not see that bitcoin as a store of wealth is a completely legitimate USE of the currency?
It says right in the sidebar:


With bitcoin, I can store my wealth and control it 100%.  If that's how I choose to USE bitcoin, that is completely allowed and you can't stop me from hodling, one of the nice benefits of bitcoin.  
One of the reasons people in the USA don't save a ton of $$$ is due to inflation.  The more inflation you have, the more you MUST spend money because it will buy you less in the future if you hold.  If you hold $1k in the bank, next year it will buy you about $975 worth of stuff according to recent CPI estimates.  
As such, putting my wealth in Bitcoin and storing it is a legitimate USE of the currency.
Saving... is USING.

Supply and demand.  No one wants to buy from Mt. Gox because they've suspended withdrawals for the time being.  As such, the demand for their coins has dropped substantially.  When demand falls, so does price.


Normal currencies have different prices and values all over the world, thats why the trillion $ forex market exists in the first place, to allow for arbitrage which creates the appearance of stability.


The stock price of Lehman Brothers vs. Goldman Sachs in late 2008 was a similar experience.  They were both investment banks which held investments in tons of different assets.  However, one stock price went to $0 when insolvent while Goldman kept on chugging.  When you buy bitcoins from an exchange, you will pay a premium for the security of the exchange, the more reliable the exchange, the higher the price they can charge, hence, the price difference.

A holder of stock (a shareholder) has a claim to a part of the entity's assets and earnings. In other words, a shareholder is an owner of a company. Ownership is determined by the number of shares a person owns relative to the number of outstanding shares.
Each share of Apple is a fraction of the value of the company, which makes products and such.
Each Bitcoin is stock in the Bitcoin network, it represents 1/12,000,000 of the value of the network.
Each $ is stock in the US Gov't.  It's a claim on the value created by the gov't and it's people.
Each troy ounce of Gold is stock in the market for Gold.  IT's a claim of 1/XXX ounces of gold in the world.

Bitcoin, apparently (well, kind of, if he hadn't contradicted himself in his own argument):
From the article:


Twenty-ish lines later....


Well then, which is it? Can you "confidently assert" that bitcoins have intrinsic value if you've just posed that nothing has intrinsic value about three paragraphs earlier?
My argument is that intrinsic value derives from a lack of substitutes.  Bitcoin has many substitutes, albeit imperfect substitutes like dogecoin, but substitutes.  Hence, Bitcoin has low intrinsic value, if any.  
Silver, on the other hand, is an element.  For some things, you can literally not find a substitute which can do what it does (like transfer heat) as efficiently.  This gives silver a higher intrinsic value than one of 50 crypto-currencies.

Not trolling.  I really don't get it.  
You say the advantage of Bitcoin is: 


To obtain BTC you have to convert $ to BTC by making a purchase.  That's a conversion.  You are converting $s BTC just like a stock broker will convert $ to shares of Google or whatever.
To make a purchase in BTC you have to use a BTC/USD conversion rate on Gyft (or any other BTC merchant) so you're relying on conversion rates to determine the value of BTC.  Once again, you're having to rely on conversions other people are making.  Without other people making conversions, BTC has no value.  Thus, getting away from conversions altogether will destroy the value of BTC.
You seem to think BTC is a currency, when it's actually a commodity as it's value is measured AGAINST other currencies.  People ask all the time, "what's the price of BTC?"  How many people ask you "what's the price of a dollar?" We measure the price of something in it's currency.  Since we measure the price of BTC in terms of $s, we're not using it as a currency, but rather, a pre-paid gift card.
For example, 1BTC a year ago bought you a lot more goods and services than 1BTC today because the $ has performed much better in the marketplace than BTC this year.  The price of BTC has fallen... substantially.  If you're measuring something by it's price, it is not a currency but a commodity.
As BTC relies on other currencies for it's value, it can never replace them.  This is simple logic.  Perhaps it is you who has an inaccurate understanding of BTC.

How do you invest .1BTC and turn it back into 1BTC?  I assume that by investing you mean to give the money to someone with the expectation that they earn more in the future and pay you back, right?  If there's no return on investment, then you wouldn't take the deal, right?
BTC are finite.  When you invest BTC you give your BTC to someone expecting a return based on their ability to generate profits.  In the deflationary world we're talking about, you know that profits will be decreasing every year due to deflation, you will not lend in the first place.  You'll hold, because, as you say, the employees are paid less, and the cost of electricity is less.  Because you hold your profits, you don't invest in maintaining equipment or growing your business because you know you can never generate profits as well in the future as you did today.
You say: 


That's true, we call that falling prices.  When prices fall, they still buy the same items and represent the same energy, but you don't buy them if you know they're gonna fall further.  In the future of BTC, there is no option but for prices to continue to fall.  Why would I keep making things, if I knew I would get less and less for them?
I'm a farmer, I like to grow stuff, if I work 50 hours a week, i get 50 bushels of corn, and sell those for $50 this year in the market.  If next year, I work 50 hours, get 50 bushels of corn, and sell them for $40, I'm not gonna feel that great about it, especially if I've got some relatively fixed costs, like a mortgage.  Now this mortgage is what you would call "investing"... you see, someone (the Bank) gave me a bunch of $ to buy a farm, and they are requiring me to pay it back to them.  They're not requiring me to pay them back less than they invested, because, hey, that wouldn't be an investment, right?
My 30-year mortgage that I used to acquire that farm has a fixed price, and now, due to deflation, I've got less currency to pay for it, even though, as you say, I've put in the same labor and energy and can buy the same stuff.  Next year I get $30 for my corn, but my farm mortgage is the same old nominal price, and as such, since I don't have as many $ which means it's becoming very expensive to run.  It's not too long before it becomes to expensive for me to pay for the farm due to deflation, at which point, I... stop producing and default. 
This default means that the bank's investment in my farm has failed as well, and since prices have fallen, that investment, let's say it was someone's .1BTC that they wanted to turn into 1BTC has been lost as well.  C'est La Vie.
This might be helpful:
Why is deflation bad?  Because it is a disincentive to spend your money, because whatever you buy will be cheaper in the future, as such, you hold.  you hold cash instead of investing.  You hold BTC profits instead of adding another turbine to your power company.  You hold BTC instead of paying for maintenance on the current turbines because, guess what, next year, they're just gonna produce less and less margin for you.

One of the great conundrums of bitcoin, to spend or not to spend, that is the question.
If I spend it, I won't have it anymore and the price could move up.  In this situation, I lose out and if I want to rebuy, I'll just be paying more than I would've in fiat.

Either you're right, and my car analogy is specious which means your comparison to the internet being the road for BTC is specious as well... OR, your assertion that my analogy is flawed is actually wrong and my analogy is fine.  Your choice, I'll take either.

Actually, bitcoin kinda does ban borrowing money through the invisible hand, because it's deflationary.  If you were a lender, why would you give out a loan knowing that the amount paid back to you would be worth less in the future?  If you were a borrower, why would you acquire debt, knowing it will only get harder to pay back over time, instead of being made easier to pay back through inflation?

This statement is just blatantly untrue.  Some years it deflated, other years it inflated.  Your first graph actually shows that (the little blue lines that jump up and down).

As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.*

Great point.  This actually illustrates a potential catch-22.  Your company (let's say you work for Amazon.com) won't likely pay you in bitcoin unless they accept bitcoin and have it sitting in an account to pay you with, but you as a BTC adopter won't use your bitcoin until you can be paid in it.  Companies like Bitpay and Coinbase in this example are actually preventing BTC from being used because they're keeping BTC out of the company's hand to pay to it's employees.

It has lost 60% of it's value in the last year....
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:47:49
No, no one here can explain, because inherently, there's no reason to use Bitcoins as currency if you've not held them for a long time and realized gains.  It's a classic Catch-22, Bitcoin users here that've held for a long time say that's it's a great currency, because they capture gains when they buy a product from a vendor.  Anyone potentially new to using Bitcoin has no reason to buy, because it just adds an extra step in the purchasing process that they previously didn't need to perform and for which, they receive no additional benefit than just using cash/credit/giftcard.
As a currency, Bitcoin provides no additional utility to the user and simultaneously increases risk of loss to the user as there's not much opportunity for insurance or protection from fraud, theft, etc.
One day, cryptocurrency technology will be an efficient secure method of transfer from one account to another across the globe, but honestly, even Western Union could set up their own "WUCoin" and have their own blockchain.  Home Depot could have their own "HDCoin" you could use as store credit, just like a gift card. 
Until AVERAGE people are paid salaries in Bitcoin and have a renewable source of Bitcoins without using $ to purchase them, it's just a stock.  Stocks rise/fall with increases/decreases in demand.

If it's a "hold" then why are you buying?
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:48:02
Yes, the price has risen and as such the transaction volume has decreased. 
This shows that if BTC continues to rise in price, the transactional volume will continue to decrease. 
As such, a company that knows it will always be receiving LESS BTC for it's products every year, will be unlikely to adopt it as a currency.  It may still use BTC as payment option through coinbase or bitpay, but shareholders won't vote to ever accept just BTC as currency.
This chart shows that BTC is not a currency, but a commodity.  It's literally acting like gold.

Well, pretty much any gift card I've ever had is divisible.  I have a $50 Dunkin Donuts card in my wallet right now from my boss as a "thank you" for helping out on a recent project outside the purview of my job.  Lucky for me, DD allows for divisibility and coffee doesn't cost $50 or it would be a pretty lame gift.


We were talking about purchases weren't we? I've made exactly 0 international transfers in my life as my purchases are typically local or online.  Some people need this feature to engage in their day to day activities (expats working here for example), others like me, don't.  I've never used Western Union, just like I've never shopped at Ikea, it doesn't mean that I don't think furniture is useless, I've just been able to function just fine without Ikea.


Cash is not dependent of a 3rd party to redeem it.  For example, I took my buddy to lunch the other day at work, he paid me back in cash.  I don't accept cash from my buddy for lunch, go to the federal reserve, have them approve that it's real, then head back home.  I just accept it and then use it on another item moving forward.


Actually, many of the places you can use Bitcoin are simply using Bitpay, which is actually a 3rd party service that converts the bitcoin to fiat and immediately settles the transaction (remember your whole "not dependent of a 3rd party to redeem it" argument????? hmmmm) in cash so the vendor doesn't take on risk.  Then you, because you're so awesome at replenishing, pay bitpay or coinbase fees to "replenish" your wallet.  Even you admit that fiat will already work at these places.  So basically, you take on additional fees and an extra step to complete a transaction I can complete with the cash my buddy gave me for lunch.
You're really not making a great case for bitcoin.  Please note that I didn't bring up deflation as an issue in this response.  I brought up the fact that all the "great" things about bitcoin you note aren't all that great at the moment.

If you control the supply of a currency, you can control the price.  
The Fed controls the supply of $.  When they decide to increse supply through QE, the value of $s falls, forcing people to spend. 
The 5-6 big BTC miners control the supply of BTC.  When they dump the newly minted coins on the market, supply increases, resulting in a price decline. 
Its..... Identical...

I trade currencies all the time, bitcoin is a currency.  One great way to make money on a currency trade is to hold a currency that is increasing in value relative to another.  In this case, over the last 5 months, holding $ instead of bitcoins has been a very strong play.  you can buy 3x the bitcoins today that you could 5 months ago.  Hence, my reasoning above:


would have served you a lot better, because today, you could buy 3x as much for the same fiat.

Well, the hash rate (Green Line) is trending below the actual difficulty level (Red line) which means those with operating mining hardware will gain a bit of profitability in the short-term because there is less competition for coins (likely due to the falling price and miners shutting hardware off because they weren't profitable). 
Likely, they'll tell their friends how awesome it is that they're getting more coins more easily, then their friends will buy mining hardware or turn their hardware back on and the hash rate will go up again, causing the difficulty to increase until it's not profitable anymore, then it will fall when folks shut off their old hardware... Rinse and repeat... until all coins have been mined.
This is how actual mining companies make decisions to shutter/reopen/shutter/reopen mines all over the world.  Silver companies right now are trying to decide whether to keep doors open with low silver prices or just shutter operations (which decreases the supply of silver causing a price increase) until they're profitable again.

Maybe, maybe not, the dollar's "collapse" could happen as fast or faster than bitcoin's rise over the last few years.

No, I've not been downvoting you, the "invisible hand" of the marketplace is taking care of that for us.  You aren't educating me, actually, I think it's the other way around.  You wrote:


I then wrote:


Then you wrote more recently: 


Yes, now you are correct as you recognize that inflation (rising prices) and monetary inflation (increased money supply) aren't the same thing, thanks to me correcting you earlier. 
Bitcoin, in the long term, will be a deflationary currency because mining will continue halving meaning fewer coins will be entering circulation and coins will be lost through negligence/lostkeys/confiscation/etc, never to be replaced.  
The supply of bitcoins is essentially capped, there will be fewer and fewer coins chasing goods.  When you have fewer BTC each year chasing the same goods (like you said, people have to eat), the price of that good in BTC will decrease.  This is deflation.  
A pizza used to cost 10,000BTC in 2009, now it costs about 0.05BTC 2014.  That's deflation in action.  If you had bought that pizza in 2009, you would've essentially given up millions of $ worth of purchasing power if you'd just held the coins and not participated.... you'd hate yourself for it, and you'd never make the same mistake again.  If you had it all to do over again, I'm sure you'd choose not to buy the pizza.  People who know that their BTC will buy more later, won't spend it today, unless forced to spend it due to starvation.
That's what I'm arguing, that once people realize what deflation means, you stop spending altogether, thus, destroying the economy.
Let's imagine something as mundane as a mortgage to illustrate how much a deflationary BTC usage would decimate the economy.  Let's say you want to buy a house for 1000BTC, but you only have 200BTC, so you need to get a loan from a bank for the remaining 800BTC.  You close on the deal on Jan 1, 2014 and now you owe 800BTC to the bank, payable over 30 years, with interest.  Let's call your payment a fixed 3BTC/month.  Not too bad right?
Your employer currently pays you 10BTC/month for all the amazing work you do today building iphones.  That means you pay only 30% of your take home BTC for your mortgage, not bad, right?  It's pretty easy to make a house payment.
Well, next year, BTC deflates further as it does every year, your employer will only be able to pay you 9BTC/month because the prices of labor have fallen along with the price of iphones so now there are less BTC to pay you for your work.  Your job is just as difficult, but now you get paid less.    
Just like the 10,000BTC pizza, you've become cheaper over time.  You will never get a raise, because prices are falling all around you, YOUR PRICE (labor) is also falling.  Now your monthly mortgage (which is fixed) is 33% of your take home.  So you've got less money for food/electricity/etc...
Next year, your boss pays you 8BTC/month because... deflation.  Yet your mortgage is the same, now representing 38% of your take home pay.
Next year, your boss pays you 7BTC/month because... deflation.  Yet your mortgae is the same, now representing 43% of your take home pay.
Next year, your boss pays you 6BTC/month because... deflation.  Yet your mortgage is the same, now representing 50% of your take home pay.
 
Next year, your boss pays you 5BTC/month because... deflation.  Yet your mortgage is the same, now representing 60% of your take home pay.  It's getting really hard to buy food, even though food prices are falling.  No one is buying iphones anymore, because next year they will be much cheaper anyway, so why spend BTC on them, right?
Next year, your boss pays you 4BTC/month because... deflation.  Yet your mortgae is the same, now representing 75% of your take home pay.
Next year, your boss pays you 3BTC/month because... deflation.  Yet your mortgae is the same, now representing 100% of your take home pay.
Your mortgage is getting quite expensive... do you keep working? Probably not, because you wouldn't be able to feed yourself anyway.  
Here's something else to consider entirely.  No bank would ever make that mortage with you, knowing that you'd never be able to pay it back because of a deflationary currency in the first place.  As such, you wouldn't have been able to buy a house to begin with. 
A deflationary currency is much, much worse, than an inflationary currency.  The US has had 4 periods of extreme deflation and things were, ugly.

A method of payment and a currency aren't the same thing.  By your logic, because a merchant accepts a MasterCard, that makes it a currency.  
My MasterCard isn't a currency, it's a payment method.  The transaction with a merchant is settled in fiat by a 3rd party vendor, JUST LIKE A BITPAY TRANSACTION.
Bitpay and coinbase are just 3rd party payment processors who have taken bitcoin and made it a gift card.  They are destroying bitcoin's adoption as a currency and promoting it's adoption as a payment method.  Keep in mind, they both go out of business if bitcoin is ever truly a currency.

I don't pay GEICO for fun, I pay them so that they will make me whole if something happens to the car.  


It's not GEICOs fault that a tree falls on my car, but they're accepting risk for me because I PAY them to do so.  It's also not PROFIT.  Being made whole is not a situation where I plan to profit, I just want my car fixed or replaced.
Another example, I don't always like the federal gov't, but I PAY them taxes which go to fund things like the FDIC, which guarantees that if my bank is robbed, my savings will be safe.  I'm not trying to PROFIT from a failed bank, I'm just trying to protect myself.
Bitcoin does not allow for these protections for the consumer.  As such, those who are risk-averse when it comes to investments or money (probably about 90% of people) aren't likely to utilize it as a currency until these safeguards are in place and operating effectively.

Sure, Amazon might accept Bitcoin in the future which will be awesome for those who bought in a couple years ago, but why would a non-owner of Bitcoin care? That's my point, no one seems to want to answer this, my hypothesis is that it's because there is no benefit to bitcoin unless you already hold it, which is the Catch-22 I was talking about.
Put yourself in the shoes of someone who doesn't own bitcoins, what's the benefit to you of being able to buy on Amazon when you can just use a credit card already for the same price and you don't even have to set up a wallet, risk a major market move, or get your computer hacked and lose your coins.

Imagine if someone invented the automobile in 1600 in Massachusetts.  There were no freaking roads to drive on, so anyone who saw the automobile would think it was utterly useless, except the inventor.  The inventor would talk about how amazing and transformative life will be when everyone has an automobile and can drive from place to place.  However, the locals, unable to do anything with the automobile, wouldn't buy it, and the inventor goes broke.  That's what's happening right now with Bitcoin.  It's an automobile without a road to drive on.

chicken and egg argument, right?  
how will the price stabilize if the number of hands holding doesn't increase?
Right now, the bitcoin transation works like this:
1) consumer goes to coinbase, purchases bitcoin with fiat, incurs currency risk associated with holding
2) coinbase collects a fee
3) consumer goes to merchant, pays for item in bitcoin
4) merchant instantly converts to fiat to mitigate risk
5) coinbase collects a fee
6) coinbase resells bitcoin to next consumer, who holds the risk yet again
In this model, the currency is still the $, the price is measured in $s and the merchant settles in $, bitcoin is only a payment method, like a prepaid gift card.  In this model, there is nothing revolutionary, except that the consumer is bearing the currency risk instead of the gov't which issues the currency.
The only winner in this model is coinbase, they're not actually providing any value.  They're not increasing the number of consumers because there's no incentive for the merchant to seek vendors who will settle in bitcoins or pay employees in bitcoin.

I looked at the coinometrics website, I appreciate the link, pretty neat dataset.  It was actually funny, I kept clicking on Gold and Oil to see how they compared to Bitcoin from a volatility perspective and wasn't seeing them becuase they appear at the bottom as a tiny straight line, whereas the volatility of Bitcoin is wildly swinging.  Granted this was since the inception of Bitcoin so I shrunk my data field down to the last 3 months... same thing.  I went to the lst 30 days... same thing, with even straighter lines for the gold/oil/S&amp;P.  
If anything, this proves the opposite of your statement.  Bitcoin is still so much more wildly volatile, that we can't determine an effective relationship between price movements in BTC and things like Gold/Oil/S&amp;P.  As such, it makes perfect sense why merchants won't hold it currently.

One lb of gold is $17,500 at current prices.

Paypal isn't accepting Bitcoin as a currency, they're accepting it as a payment method and immediately converting to cash through Coinbase.  
Just because you accept a payment method, doesn't mean you "associate" with the company.  For example, if I run a small business and accept "Visa/MC/Discover" on my POS but the transaction is completed by a third party bank, I'm not actually a supporter of MC/Visa/etc.  
Coinbase is the only company that benefits here.  They get more access to people dumping coins. Paypal really doesn't care whether or not bitcoin is adopted, they'll still take $s either way.

Imagining a world without the problem of volatility isn't a solution, because guess what, we live in reality where volatility is a huge issue.

I had two options, I went with the "approved" twist.  Or I could've just agreed with you and taken it one step further as an attack on bitcoin.
What I really wanted to do was the latter and call out the fact that any company which uses BitPay shouldn't be counted amonst "vendors" who "accept" bitcoin because they aren't using bitcoin as a currency, but as a payment method... like Visa.... 
That is, in their eyes (Peter Shiff's in this case), bitcoin comes in for payment, and immediately goes to the 3rd party payment processor (bitpay) for cash reimbursement.  The transaction is denominated in $s and settled in $s, bitcoin is not the currency.
Needless to say, I went the other direction.

What you're advocating is that the consumer should shoulder currency risk instead of the vendor, which is what I said they're already doing.
The problem with this, is it means bitcoin will never be a currency and will be relegated to being a risky niche "prepaid gift card" usable at limited vendors... sorry, there's nothing revolutionary about it, it's not gonna change the world if that's the box you want to keep bitcoin in.

So after bitcoin changes to a mBTC or whatever you'll be able to say, "They're really cheap.  One thousand bits are only 50 cents."
They'll say . "Wow, awesome, I'll buy 100,000 bits."
Awesome right? That is until they go out and can't figure out why a dinner and drinks at a bar costs 125,000 bits.  They'll walk away feeling like a BTC is worthless.  It'd be just as psychological but in the other direction.  Instead of being too expensive, they'll be considered worthless.  
As long as you try to compare the value of bitcoin to a $, people will just consider bitcoin a gift card, not a currency.

C'mon think! This is an extra step that requires the user to also accept unnecessary risk.  Why would anyone do this when they could just use cash.  Bitcoin's value will only truly go up if faith in the $ falls. Merely using it as a payment method will have no bearing on the price of bitcoin.

They're not "voluntarily transparent" at all, they get an external audit every year and are non-taxable, those are pretty hefty benefits to being "transparent".  They're not being voluntary, they receive millions of dollars tax free to be "transparent" .
They're also definitely not "regulation apolitical".  They write "standards" for things like UL110 "sustainability of Mobile Phones" where they make sure that in the US mobile phones have to be built to certain specs to get "their" logo on it, which of course, raises prices for users.  It's extremely political and there has been numeous instances of corruption where testers abroad (especially China) have been bribed.

You act like coinbase and bitcoin are somehow "white knights" that are just going to get everybody using BTC and then walk away. Their business model isn't some kind of benevolent support network, they ONLY make a % if the business does not keep bitcoins and wants cash. That is, they ONLY make money if the company doesn't use BTC as a currency.  They are a profit-seeking company who has an incentive to keep business from using BTC to pay their vendors and employees.
You mention that this is required to help the economy "stand alone".  Newsflash, Coinbase and Bitpay aren't interested in a "stand alone" bitcoin economy, because it makes them irrelevant.  
This is the reason Jamie Dimon hates bitcoin, because it makes him irrelevant.  Coinbase and Bitpay, are by definition, leeching a % of every BTC transaction that occurs on these companies who are "accepting" Bitcoins.

Also, your assertion that protections will be built in the future are suspect as well.

You're paying a 3rd party vendor (coinbase/bitpay) to transfer bitcoins (gift card) to you to spend.  Then, after you've bought whatever you wanted to buy, you get to do it all over again.
Why wouldn't I just use cash or a credit/debit card?

The argument is that Bitcoins are not used by the business accepting them, so there isn't really an "adoption" because the BTC ends up back in the hands of Coinbase.  The buyer from overstock didn't get a discount, overstock saved a few pennies on CC fees, and Coinbase got to take their 2%.

I'm not new to BTC, I've owned them for about 2 years now, and have continually bought until last summer, when I thought we had moved into bubble territory (I was right, it's been flat since last October).  In the last 10 months, the price has fallen, that's 20% of bitcoin's existence where it's been in the negative.  
The most common question I get from people not affiliated with Bitcoin is "where can I buy them?"  In pretty much every scenario including yours, the answer relies on them giving a ton of personal data to an online source or risking a creepy cash transaction in a parking lot.  The problem with bitcoins isn't the protocol, it's that the average Joe can't obtain them without incurring substantial risk.  Until we, the bitcoin community, acknowledge this, we will be stuck in the kind of stagnation we're experiencing, where nothing really happens, because we've saturated the neck-beard market.

The second graph doesn't have any sources anyway, it's just a line that shows Real GDP going up from 1820 to 2000, it doesn't have anything to do with deflation or inflation, that's what "real GDP" means, it means adjusted for deflation/inflation.  Real GDP can go up just due to population increases which would have a higher r-squared than inflation/deflation.  More people working results in more output, it doesn't mean that the type of currency had anything do do with it.  Also, in that example, 50% (1913-2000) of the time used for "evidence" is when the $ was decidedly inflationary.  I don't see how it supports your assertion, if anything, it proves the opposite.

I agree the CPI was higher in 1800 than 1900, we are disagreeing fundamentally on where the deflation came from.  I'm arguing it's not caused by the currency, you're arguing that the currency was deflationary.  The currency supply increased over that time, production of goods just increased at a faster rate, causing deflation.  It wasn't the currency that was deflationary, it was the economy. 
Likely, I think things like the industrial revolution, railroads, and increased population that made production increase and prices fall.  Inventions like the cotton gin allowed for much greater production of usable cotton, causing the price of cotton relative to gold to fall.  It wasn't gold that deflated in supply, it was the cost of producing cotton relative to it which changed. As such, the CPI would decrease, but not because of the currency.
Bitcoin, however, is designed to become more rare over time (21Million coins max minus any lost/destroyed coins coupled with a growing population), this means that any technological innovation outside of the currency (like new technology making electric car batteries more efficient and "affordable") will result in even greater annual deflationary shifts.

Let's say they have 10BTC in their wallet.  Let's say they bet 1BTC that BTC reaches $10k and it only goes to $9k.  They didn't lose $9k, they lost today's price of BTC ($625) or so. Now consider what the value of their wallet is, they still have 9BTC.
The value of their BTC wallet is now $90,000

Horizontal bitcoin spending appears to me like you've added an extra step in the purchasing process that you wouldn't have to take normally.
Normal purchase:
1) your employer pays you local currency and deposits into your bank account
2) you swipe a debit card to buy an item from a merchant
Horizontal Bitcoin purchase:
1) your employer pays you local currency and deposits into your bank account
2) you go to an exchange, buy bitcoins with your local currency, paying the fees to convert
3) buy the item from the merchant in bitcoins
I don't really see what's revolutionary about this.  In fact, you've added risk to the transaction and incurred fees.  If you're not offered a discount from the merchant, you're actually paying more for the item to take on this risk, it's irrational.
Also, if the merchant is utilizing Bitpay and Coinbase to instantly process bitcoin transactions and receive local currency, then the only people who profit from horizontal spending... are bitpay and coinbase.  The merchant is still ultimately only accepting cash, which means their employees aren't being paid in bitcoin either.  
In this scenario, bitcoin isn't a currency, but a pre-paid credit card with lower fees than a normal credit-card and a higher risk of loss.

Income is money that an individual or business RECEIVES in exchange for providing a good or service or through investing capital.
Using currency is not an "income related activity" if your intent is not to profit from the activity.  For example, giving currency (exchanging it) to a homeless guy is not an "income producing activity" because I have no expectation I will ever see a profit from the exchange.  
I noted I bought bitcoin to use as a currency.  Using currency is not "indeed an income related activity" unless I use the BTC as capital to invest in something else from which I expect to receive a profit.  If I'm using it to buy goods that I have no intention of profiting from, then I'm not using them as income producers.  For example, if I buy dinner, my intent is to eliminate hunger, not create additional assets for myself through profit.

That's a non-sequitor.  Ultimately, you appear to be arguing:
1) More people will use bitcoin because more companies are accepting, which makes it more viable. 
2) Because it's more viable, more companies will accept it.
3) Additional acceptance by companies (more outlets) will result in more people using Bitcion.
Do you see the circular fault in your logic?  One does not follow the other.  You're arguing that more people will choose to use something more because more people choose to use something.
This is the primary issue with Bitcoin that fervent supporters seem to miss.  This is the reason that when Overstock.com decides to accept Bitcoin, there is no discernable effect on the price of bitcoin, because acceptance of a payment method doesn't increase the DEMAND for the currency.  
If you're already a user of Bitcoin, it's awesome for you find out Overstock.com accepts it because now you can spend your bitcoin there.  Everyone on this subreddit goes nuts for new acceptance because it's proof of "wider adoption" and thus "to the moon".
However, if you're not already an owner/user of bitcoin, then Overstock.com accepting it provides you no additional utility.  If there's no additional utility for you as a non-user, your demand for Bitcoins hasn't changed, as such, you don't run out and buy Bitcoins.  If there isn't a new user made through overstock's acceptance, then "wider adoption" isn't' occurring.

The fed has two major levers they can pull to control the economy.  
The first lever is the Fed Funds Rate.  This is the rate payed between banks to borrow money from the Fed to then loan to other institutions, investors, homebuyers, etc.  This rate is currently "listed" as .25% but the fact that QE is even occuring means the "real" fed rate is actually negative.  How can they say they charge a interest when they're putting money which didin't previously exist on the monthly auction block?  
The second lever, as you note, is QE, that is, the Fed increasing it's balance sheet by increasing the money supply to cause more dollars to chase fewer services.  The idea of course, by making the $ less valuable, the  economy is stimulated into spending because why would you hold a currency which is being debased?  The goal, is to increase the velocity of money, which is the ultimate indicator of a healthy economy.
By chance, an article came out yesterday which discusses this specific issue about how the fed rate is actually negative due to quantitative easing:
The scariest part of all of this, is that even with all of this QE (cheap money) for people to borrow, the velocity of money has never been lower, which is counter-intuitive to pretty much any monetary policy theory.  
This post itself, blaming people for "hoarding" is the response of scared investors, they know that money velocity has dropped from 17+ in 2008 to less than 5 now.  That means, people are holding dollars, afraid to spend them but believe that holding them and suffering inflation is BETTER than the alternative of putting the money to work in the economy. The fed is intentionally trying to make $s worth LESS to force people into spending, only, it's not working.... at all.  
What I'm talking about is that the fed knows it's not working, and will have to shift policy.  Since they only have two levers, and they're both pulled already, the only thing they can really do is raise the fed funds rate in hopes that makes people think things are back to normal, of course, this will probably spell the end of our current petrol-dollar system.  It will be a hail-mary, with the only other option to be global military action to stimulate economic growth... neither option is good.

Why would a merchant who instantly converts Bitcoin into $$$ pressure suppliers to accept a currency they don't hold? or employees to accept payment for employment in a currency they don't hold?
I agree that Bitcoin is a payment method, but we're kidding ourselves if we think it's getting any closer to becoming a currency just because Coinbase signs up another merchant.  
To take it a step further, Coinbase and Bitpay are probably actually hoping that Bitcoin doesn't ever get fully adopted as a currency, because it would obsolete them.

Actually, that's my point, Coinbase is trying to remove the volatility instead of allowing the free-market to do so. In doing so, they're making BTC a non-currency, because one of the features of currency is that it's a medium of exchange.  That is, you as a seller, choose to accept that item as payment for the item you're selling.  Coinbase, in their infinite wisdom, is removing the risk of that choice from the seller, and as such, the seller isn't really "accepting" BTC, because they're being paid in $ by coinbase.  The $ is still the currency, whilst the BTC is just a prepaid visa.

I'm arguing that Bitcoin is also inflationary in the short-term.  In the last year the supply of BTC has gone from 11.6M to 13.2M today.  That's a 13.8% growth in the supply (inflation) of bitcoin.
By contrast, the $ supply over that same time has gone from $3.6T to just over $4T today, or an 11% increase.  
As such, Bitcoin is actually inflating at a greater rate than the $.  This actually makes the decrease in the BTC/$ exchange rate over time.

That's just not true... debt becomes worthless as a currency becomes worthless... the dollar has been steadily decreasing in purchasing power, yet fixed mortgage payments stay the same.
To illustrate, I'll give you my personal example, I bought a house 20 years ago for $67000.  At the time, that was a lot of money.  My monthly mortgage is fixed at $325.  Since that time, I've increased my take home pay roughly 300% and the dollar has devalued substantially.  At the time I bought the house, gas was $0.95/gallon, milk and eggs were under $1 each.  Today, everything else is more expensive... EXCEPT my mortgage payment (MY ONLY DEBT).  Thanks to the dollar "crashing" and my debt being fixed through my mortgage, my house gets easier to pay back each year.
Thereby, you can see how DEBT becomes worthless as the dollar becomes worthless.

The 10000BTC pizza was more expensive.  
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:53:40


I just don't see it in a practical example.  Let's say you make 1200BTC/year salary this year.  You buy a house for 5000BTC taking out a loan for the whole shebang.  You have to pay 20BTC/Month fixed for 30 years to cover the mortgage or 20% of your monthly take home.  This gives the bank a return of 20% over 30 years, or under 1% annualized interest.
Bitcoin is deflationary, that is, next year, your salary won't be 1200BTC, because it will have deflated, let's say it's only 10% deflation (keep in mind, last year's price run would mean a deflation rate of like 6000% so 10% would be a nicely "stable" bitcoin annualized deflation).  So now your boss pays you 1080BTC because that's all they can afford due to deflation, yet your mortgage is still 20BTC/month, which is now 22% of your monthly take home.
The following year, let's say it deflates another 10%.  Now you're getting paid 972BTC, yet now your mortgage 25% of your take home.  Even though your BTC will buy you more groceries and fuel because it's deflating, your boss can't afford to keep paying you the same.  Your house, however, is getting more expensive every time BTC deflates.
By year 10, it's all of your take home, and you foreclose.  Since the bank can do math, there's no way they make the loan in the first place, knowing you won't be able to pay it back.
So even with an annualized rate &lt;1%, the loan doesn't get made.

1 Bitcoin will be worth 1 Bitcoin at the end of this decade.  If you're going to call it a currency, then measuring it's buying power in terms of another currency you use to price things is doing it a disservice.  You're making it into a volatile gift card, instead of a currency.

Statistically speaking, probably not.  He likely retired at 45 like most Greeks.  He's likely been retired with full pension for over 30 years or 40% of his time on earth which is hardly "all his life".

Sure, if you did that it would have worked out.  You chose one peak and one valley on a 6-year curve and turned a profit.  Nice job, hindsight is 20/20.  But for your example to work, you would've needed a lender to loan it to you at $1000 and then a buyer at $220.  No such lender existed then, which is my original point.  You're also ignoring that the  "currency" in that transaction is the $, not BTC.  BTC is the commodity in that example, not a currency.
I'm asserting that no lenders of BTC will exist... because of the nature of BTC being deflationary.  Are there any lenders of BTC?  I can get a loan in pretty much any currency, EXCEPT, bitcoin.  This is because although BTC claims to be a currecny, it is not, it's simply a commodity... and a deflationary commodity at that.
@_date: 2015-04-14 12:54:56
Cant tell if serious question, but I'll answer it anyway in case anyone else out there is interested.
You would never make a loan with a deflationary currency because the individual you loan the money to could never pay you back once the currency deflated.  Deflationary currencies are just that... deflationary, that is, the wages you make to pay back the loan will continue to purchase less and less, meaning your ability to pay back the BTC you borrowed also decreases.
BTC is arguably the most deflationary currency we've ever seen.  
To illustrate, imagine if you'd loaned someone 10,000 BTC in early 2010.  That was about $20 worth of BTC then.  Not a big loan, right?  Surely they can pay you back $20? After all, they make like $50,000 annually?  Since then, BTC has deflated by 10s of thousands of percentage points.  The individual you loaned that money to, now owes you about $2.5M worth of BTC.  Their BTC amount owed to you hasn't changed, but their ABILITY to pay you back in equivalent purchasing power has decreased due to the deflation of bitcoin.  You as the lender, just lost out, big time.  You would never make another loan.
As a potential lender, you never make a loan with a currency you expected to deflated.   Without loans, our economy would stagnate and suffer, this is why the federal reserve works to keep an INFLATION rate of about 2% annually.  Inflationary currencies promote lending (no one wants to hold the hot potato so you loan it out).  Deflationary currencies are the opposite, you HODL them.

No, when I say BTC is deflationary, i'm saying that it is actively deflating against other currencies.  The price curve over the last 6 years shows that pretty clearly, albeit with short-term peaks and valleys.  Run the curve on a 200+ day moving average and you've got a steady uptrend in BTC value vs. other currencies.  


You'll need to clarify this statement.  It seems to be saying that no matter what, it's dangerous for lenders.  I fail to see how this disagrees with what I said orginally, "No one would make a loan in bitcoin"
You know... because... risk.


That's correct.  But one difference in bitcoin is that it's decentralized, so that when a deflationary cycle starts with bitcoin, there is no entity to help soften the blow or turn things around.   That type of volatility will be it's downfall.  You can reset the $'s value by attaching it to other assets, we've done this a number of times in US history during volatile economic periods.  Bitcoin does not allow for this mechanic, it's literally "deflation incarnate"... by design.

Simple, US October job numbers were announced at 271k, which look great, causing confidence in the $, resulting in a short-term fall in Precious Metals prices.

No... production is halted when it is unprofitable, causing the gold supply to decrease in the short-term, creating a shortage.  The shortage results in a price increase.  
The difference between gold and BTC is that we have gold reserves, so  the market can handle short term price shocks.  However, BTC has transactions that need immediate verification, now.  If miners stop solving the blockchain calculations, people's transactions don't get confirmed and the currency becomes unreliable.

I like your example, I think you forgot part of the steps required though:
Example (US): 1) Have decided to buy a $20 book on Amazon. 2) Exchange $20 for BTC at Coinbase at whatever rate and WAIT 1-3 WEEKS FOR YOUR BTC TO ARRIVE IN YOUR WALLET. 3) Immediately buy a $20 Gyft card (denominated in BTC) paying directly from Coinbase. 4) Use the Gyft card to pay for the goods at Amazon. A little circuitous still, but in all it takes 3 minutes/WEEKS, not much more than it would take you to fill in your credit card info at Amazon in the first place.

This is one of the biggest problems that a deflationary currency will face.  It could very well destroy Bitcoin.  right now, it's hyper-deflationary, which means you'd be an idiot to spend it.   So you will hoard it, because you have economic incentives to do so.  
Inflationary currencies force people to transact out of their currencies into goods to avoid losing purchasing power, which increases economic output.  
Bitcoin is doing the opposite.  ALl you have to do to verify this would be to look at the top 100 wallets, they know this, and their last transaction dates prove it.

Hell, I'm in my 30s, I'm a libertarian, but I wouldn't say I'm a "long-time libertarian" because that doesn't make it any more relevant or give me any more knowledge than a newer libertarian.

The answer is simple.  Te Fed has a hugely inflated balance sheet with a ton of liabilities they do not intend to pay back (and couldn't even if that was not their intention).  Theyre fine with another currency taking over and all they'll need is about 10% of it to control it.

^ This, is the type of info i'm looking for.  Thank you for the well thought reply.  Knowing that the difficulty doesn't correct for market changes until blocks are solved is extremely important.  In that situation (20 years from now) it would be quite possible for a major miner to have a problem (think Tsunami) which knocks them out of processing.  This results in significant wait times for confirmation, and potentially could result in total economic shutdown as no one can process transactions.  Although this is different than my initial concern,  I think this is a risk that can only be mitigated through diversification of miners, unfortunately, I don't see that trend currently.

I wish you the best of luck in your venture.  To play devil's advocate.  You're recommending taking your BTC and putting your faith in everyone in the rest of the world and hoping that one doesn't go do something stupid that debases your currency's value.  
For example, right now anyone with 12,000 BTC can move the market with a single trade.  That one person sees a price of $600 BTC, sells, causing the market to dip, then buys back at $550, pocketing the $60K in cash or reinvesting in BTC, and still holds their BTC.  Oh, and they can do this, forever, because the supply is finite.

I've traded on cex.io.  Here are my thoughts:
It really depends on your goals, if you're a short term investor, maybe it's worth your time.  If you're looking for something long-term, forget it.  Also, it's basically adding risk to an already volatile instrument.
The trading floor runs on a BTC/GHS exchange rate.  That is, you pay BTC for GHS at a posted market rate and then are rewarded with a piece of the mining that is occurring at some mining farm.  You can trade in the extreme short-term hoping that the GHS value increases.  
The thing is, as the difficulty rises, the value of GHS goes down, so eventually, the "stock" that you bought, GHS, has no where to go but zero, as such you won't have any buyers, at which point, the "owner" of the site will have a ton of coins (formerly yours) while you are stuck getting smaller and smaller mining payouts.
My prediction on cex.io is that it's no longer in operation by mid next year.

You guys that are butt-hurt because the fair market capitalization estimated is $1300/BTC need to remember that that's TODAY'S fair market capitalization.  A lot can change when the market changes.  Keep in mind, they're assumption is that the $ will be gaining strength as the FED TAPERS, which hasn't happened.  In the event the fed doesn't taper, the dollar will continue to inflate, making BTC more and more attractive as a potential store of value.

Great points, and I especially agree with your views on the cause of the rampant value gains being stopped by exchanges that can't handle volume.  I noted orginally that I think the lack of infrastructure was teh cause.  I think it must mature before a market capitalization of $50B can be reached.  I still think the potential of BTC is phenomenal.

Good point, education is another investment without much counterparty risk.  Basically, no one can take from you that which you know how to do.  A trained accountant or carpenter cannot have their skills taken from them.  They may lose their jobs due to changes in the economy, but the knowledge they have remains with them and can be applied in other markets.

Control the supply?  No, they can't control the supply, it's algorithmic.  New coins will be minted regardless of how many coins a gov't owns. 
They could buy a bunch of bitcoins at the prevailing market price and attempt to exert influence the relative price of bitcoin against other currencies, however, the act of purchasing the coins themselves will increase the value of bitcoin and decrease the value of the currency they use (their own).  Everytime they buy a new coin, they raise the price of BTC, and devalue their own currency, as such, giving more power to holders of BTC and decreasing the value of their currency.  Not really a risk IMO

Question, if you take 2-3 words from a sentence, do you get the full context?
When I wrote "Bitcoin production" I was speaking of the entry of new bitcoins into the market via the process of "mining".
Yes, I know there is not actual production, but that word seems to work fine in an explanation.  What word would you use?  "Discovery" "Realization", maybe you could provide a description of what IS a good descriptor, rather than simply arguing that it is not.  I'm open to suggestions.

For a small daily consumables and non-durables this might work, for any larger purchase, I'm not so sure.  This still doesn't stop you from deciding, "Well, that flat-screen TV is 1BTC today, I'll just hold off for a month and buy it for .8BTC.
The problem gets much worse as the good becomes more durable.  Imagine the anxiety over buying a car.  If you buy a honda civic today for 20BTC and drive it for a couple years, imagine how pissed you will be at yourself when you see a BTC exchange rate of $10,000/1BTC and know you could've waited.   
Needless to say, you won't make the same mistake twice... you'll hoard... that is, until the economy provides you the incentive to do otherwise.

Yes, this, they need to be sufficient to compensate the labor.  And pay the investors a return for the infrastructure they own.  With a capped monetary supply and increasing electricity costs due to finite resources, the only response will be to raise fees.  
If people are willing to leave Credit cards because of 3% transactions fees to buy BTC, it's reasonable to theorize that people will be willing to leave BTC for transaction fees that they consider onerous to some other currency.

Deflation doesnt really relate to cars.  Cars typically get more expensive every year.  You're talking about depreciation regarding cars, not deflation.  Cars don't store value well.
Electronics is a better example.  But still, it's not really deflation, it's just competition and innovation. 
Bitcoin deflation is different.  Limited coins coupled with greater adoption rates equals rising price.  You'd be an idiot to spend your coins if you believe the story if bitcoins.  Of course, if you don't spend them, they won't get adopted and lose value.  The invisible hand will help bitcoin find a price eventually.  
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:49:36


Haha, great argument, way to ignore the definition of counterparty risk. Counterparty risk is the risk to each party of a contract that the counterparty will not live up to its contractual obligations.  Where is the counter-party risk of any asset held as a store of value?  Of course in a scenario without any parties to an agreement it has no counterparty risk.  By that defnition, stuffing money in a mattress also has no counterparty risk, because there is no counter party.  My point was that this isn't an argument for the use of bitcoin as a store of value.

Eh, all I said was that inflation promotes spending.  Bad spending and good spending are relative and subjective.  
Deflation will result in less purchases, but not necessarily in exchange for quality.  Think about mortgages.  Why would a lender give you BTC for a house, knowing that it will be worth less BTC when they go to sell it and the buyer won't be able yo pay you back. In this case, deflation has resulted in one less purchase (cause no one bought the house) but also, there has been no increased quality of life either.

If your goal is to pay off your mortgage, why don't you just take out a HELOC and use the funds to purchase BTC.  If it goes up in value, you pay off your house and the HELOC, if it loses value, you pay back the HELOC.  In either scenario, you're still getting tax free growth on your 401k an not giving up your matching contributions.  Also, the interest on the HELOC is tax deductible.

Same thing happened to me earlier this week.  Sent a buddy a .001BTC for his newly downloaded wallet to show him how easy it worked, only to see the .0005 fee rollup to me.

Next month, that fee could be greater than the cup of coffee, which would seriously hinder the ability of BTC to be widely accepted.

In second grade I was in a school-wide spelling bee and got knocked out in 3rd because i "incorrectly" spelled the word THEATER... i said, "THEATRE", which is a completely accepted spelling, and actually was written on the wall of the room we were in.  There were about 200 people in the room.  I protested, they told me to quit whining.  A couple of the parents in the room shouted that it was correct.  The next day, I had my parents call the school and they basically said they would give me credit for the word, but that I still finished 3rd.

Intrinsic value is derived over time and demonstrated through trade.  There is no time in history where gold had zero value to people engaged in trade.  In 2009, BTC had little to no value to people engaged in trade.  BTC has to prove itself as store of wealth overtime.  BTC is much more risky than gold right now due to it's relative immaturity.
I own gold, and BTC.  I want them both to succeed as vehicles of wealth preservation and transference.

Not a shortage of $$ a shortage of BTC.  As such, the orders coming in to coinbase cannot be filled quickly enough because the price is too volatile.  They can't buy a BTC for $450 but have already agreed to tons of orders at that price (since yesterday's buyers were at that price).  As such, they've made agreements to purchase BTC for people at a price that current BTC holders are not willing to accept.  Gap-up.  Start of a(maybe the) crash.

Honestly, I wasn't trying to be shitty to you.
I don't know your backstory, and frankly, after reading that, I'm sorry about your circumstances, I was just saying, if you need to make ends meet, you've got some assets to sell (computer, gun, etc) that you could use for food and rent instead of investing in BTC.  You're complaining about losing BTC while on foodstamps, it just rubs me the wrong way.  I'm glad you  have a place to live, many don't.  
It's just tough for me, I've actually been in a situation similar to yours years ago.
However, now I'll be standing in line at a grocery or something and some dude is paying with foodstamps while talking on their cell-phone and pulling cigarettes from their pockets.  As a taxpayer, I know that I'm directly paying for them to game the system, and frankly, I'm sick of it.  If you can buy cigarettes and cellphones, you don't need foodstamps.  If you can afford to trade BTC on a computer and own guns (which aren't cheap, I've got a few), then you don't need my help to eat.
Life is tough, pick yourself up.  Do it yourself and you don't have to answer to anyone.  Own your life.
Edit: I just read your comment history for the last 20 days and have less sympathy for you.  Paying for cloud mining and day trading on foodstamps... I retract my apology.

I'm also an auditor... when I'm reviewing transactions I don't think, "wow, I bet this business/person is peaceful, I want to shut them down..." The owners of businesses PAY us to look into the books because people, given the opportunity, motivation, or rationalization, will fucking steal from you.
The same works with reviewing individual accounts for wrongdoing... I don't go LOOKING for things to be wrong, I actually hope that I don't find anything because it creates a bunch more work, but I'm obligated ethically to report these issues when they arise. 
I don't try to ruin anyone's life, if they've broken the laws, they've done it to themselves.

Lol, in the long term (2 weeks) yes, it will reach equilibrium as the difficulty drops.
In the short term (i.e. buying groceries today), it's quite possible that confirmation times are significantly increased, resulting in significant annoyance to users.  
The last few days have shown us that the infrastructure cannot currently withstand the global interest, resulting in lag times to purchase/sell BTC.  It's resulted in lost faith in the currency.

Maybe in a few years, but right now, it won't work.  Doesn't work in a deflationary currency.  If they give you rewards quarterly or annually, they stand to go out of business because the purchasing power of that 3% could very easily be 350% by the time they send it to you in redemption.

The market for migrant workers or immigrants to send wages back home  alone is enough to keep western union afloat and that's a company with a $50B market cap.  
Bitcoin can do what WU does TODAY without paying a single employee.  Think about that for a second, an algorithm and crowdsourcing can perform the same service of a huge company without a board of directors and investors to back it.  Therein lies the utility of Bitcoin, the simple efficiency of it. 
The infrastructure is already in place, bitcoin's price must simply stabilize at a level to reflect its utility.  $50b market cap could just be the beginning.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:18:02
So, you're saying that if you want to get confirmed in a reasonable timeframe, you just pay more in transaction fees.  That's not really that efficient, because that means the price of something like a coffee is more dependent on the wait times, than the actual value of the commodity.

Thanks for the great reply. I think that waiting an hour for payment confirmation for the purchase of a car is absolutely reasonable.  However, that's not a mainstream purchase.  That's a 5-10 purchase.  A house is another great example.  Or having auto-drafts for rent, etc, are all great. 
You ask me to shift my perspective away from micropayments, but those payments are how it becomes mainstream.  That's where the real potential exists.

I agree with your points on inflation resulting in commerce that might not have value to you, but those chotchkies/knick-knacks represent someone's effort and if no one buys them, that person doesn't eat.
You note that a currency increasing in value makes businesses provide only products that provide people value.  My point is that business won't expend capital to provide any services, if doing so results in lost capital due to deflation. 
I think we could both agree that food is a valuable item to produce.  Consider the following example:  
Farmer - "If I buy a tractor now with 10BTC and plow fields, I will have lots of crops to sell to people."  
So Farmer Joe goes and buys a tractor for 10BTC.  Farmer Joe then grows his crops.  
Fast forward to the harvest when the farmer goes to market.  
Farmer - "Wait, are you telling me that my crops only net me .5BTC this year?  I grew twice as much as last year and last year i made 1BTC"
Broker - "Well, as you know, the value of BTC went up this year 400%, so your crops are worth 1/4 what they were last year"
Farmer - "This is stupid, I want to get out of the farm business, do you want to buy my tractor."  
Broker - "I'll offer you 2.5BTC"
You see, a deflationary currency cannot work, because there no motivation to keep doing more work for less return.  The farmer would've done much better just holding his 10BTC from the get-go.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:39:54
Actually, no one would go into debt in a deflationary world.  think about it.
We all talk about the guy who purchased pizzas for 10k BTC.   What if someone had given a loan to that guy for the pizzas and said, "I'll give you 10k BTC, you have to pay me back over the next 10 years with interest."  
That loan would destroy the individual because the debt burden would increase every month the payments were due.  Hence, no one in their right mind would ever take a loan in BTC either because they become more scarce over time with adoption.  Banks wouldn't give out BTC as debt either, because they'd forego a potentially cheaper loan next time.
Cmon man, deflationary spirals are simple to understand.

Satoshi Nakamoto is the name of the man. But what is his number?

S is the 19th letter of the alphabet.
N is the 14th letter of the alphabet
19+14 = 33 (Freemason's top degree)
33 * 21 (million BTC to be mined) = 693

Great comment, I agree with your assessment.  I only compared to oil because that's a commodity that's well known.  One major difference that keeps the price of oil relatively stable compared to BTC is that companies and countries manage reserves to meet market demand even if production has fallen due to falling prices.  BTC, as far as I know, does not have this infrastructure, and I don't see the provision for it to exist.  Without this insurance, I don't see a true, mainstream adoption.  
Although, I'd love for my BTC to be worth $100k+ as well.  That's why I'd like to be able to explain to folks who have money to enter the market how the risks are going to be mitigated.

Although, now that i think about it, the same problem arises, just further down the road. Transaction fees grow to a point that they outweigh the value of a transaction.  Right now, you can buy a Subway sandwich for like .02BTC.  If the transaction fees ever rose to .01BTC (which is possible given an increase in electricity costs in an increasingly populated world), you won't buy the sandwhich, cause you'd essentially be paying a tax of 50%.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:43:55
nope... you've got it backwards
They shut off the BTC tap because they purchase BTC on exchanges AFTER they get an agreed price from a buyer.  However, now the volatility is too high.  The price in $$ is rising faster than they can agree to a buyer with.  As such, they're stuck holding agreements they can't pay for.  People with open orders through coinbase are basically holding options to buy at a lower price.  Coinbase knows this is going to hurt them financially, because they'll have to cover they shorts, so they are cancelling orders.

You send them bitcoin, they give you GHS, for which the value must go to zero as difficulty rises, whilst the bitcoin you've given them will appreciate.  In the meantime, they get to buy more computing power and you get pieces of mined bitcoin (like .000001 per day per GHS) to keep you interested and telling friends about your awesome cloud mining setup, except that you don't actually own anything except depreciating hashing power which THEY tell you the value of.  
Then, when the difficulty rises further to where a GHS is essentially worthless (sometime next March or so), you sell the hashing power back to them for a price THEY set (next to nothing), and they've got your BTC AND a ton of computer equipment.  You're left with nothing.
All you really need to do to see it's a scam is to look at the 6 month chart of GHS/BTC value.  It's completely inverse to the difficulty rate, that is, people who bought GHS from them a few months ago have lost 50-80% of their value while the owners of cex.io have laughed all the way to the bank.  
It's a ponzi scheme, and not even a clever one.

It could be some type of bias... however, a single dollar used to represent a large amount of purchasing power 1/20th an ounce of gold (about $60 today... 70 years ago, that same coffee would've been $0.10 or less, no one psychologically "needed" it to be $4 so they'd feel like they got more value.  
IMHO, it's OK if 1BTC is worth a hell of a lot and you're only spending .000001 or less on daily expenses.  
Spending power is more important that how we label it.

Actually, I think there is plenty of counter-party risk.  If you buy a product online and pay with BTC, what's to stop the website from not sending the product to you?   Can you charge-back and get your BTC back? No.  Can you call the police and tell them your unrecognized currency was stolen from you?
As far as physical damage, I don't know how many stories I've read of people losing a hard-drive, password, etc that causes the total-loss of BTC to the user.  Granted, those BTC exist somewhere, but if they are inaccessible, what's the difference?
No taxes?  If bitcoin becomes more widely accepted, taxes will be an inevitability, especially if you want to have recourse in the event of wrongdoing.  Why would the police help you track a hacker if you've not been paying into their coffers with sales tax, etc?
No maintenance or security costs?  Are computers free? Are cell phones free? Is a cold-storage hard drive free?
Also, liquidity is definitely not on par with gold/silver.  I can drive to any jewelry store or pawn shop and exchange my gold/silver for spot price, now.  It takes 5 minutes.  I've yet to have a BTC transaction confirm in the time it would take me to exchange gold/silver for cash.

Nice, as a CPA, I agree with the methodology you propose.  
As a practictioner, I will say that the EOY adjustments would be a nightmare as they could significantly affect the EPS of a company.  The volatile nature of the currency means that most companies will not hold their BTC for long periods (long in BTC seems like 2 weeks),  until it stabilizes to where a company isn't risking themselves by holding such a deflationary asset.  
You wouldn't want to have to go to shareholders and say, "we had a great year, we made a ton of money by investing in BTC.  However, at the end of year, we had to mark them to market value, resulting in a translation gain that caused our annual tax bill to skyrocket, which is why we are showing no cash on our balance sheet, because the US will only accept $$ as payment of a tax bill.  As such, we can't pay you dividends, unless you'd like them in BTC"

Eventually, if there are only 10 large miners or so, then it's possible for one to leave, resulting in transaction times skyrocketing.

Yeah, but he'd be in a coffin with gold, which is decidedly more awesome than a coffin without gold

Wait.  What's Reddit?

I agree we will see hardware efficiency increase, however they are not free.
You need to be able to purchase those new ASICs with profits.  Profits, which are becoming smaller and smaller.
A lot of folks have them on order right now, and by the time they get them, they will potentially not have enough processing power to be profitable.  
I'm just saying it's a risk, and not one I've heard a solution to that results in transaction fees being able to stay low enough that people don't just hop to another currency when it becomes onerous.

That was a pretty "mightier than thou" type post.  Thanks for that.

Bitcoin, for the love of all that is holy, is not without counterparty risk.  You are reliant on merchants to continue accepting bitcoins, consumers to continue to use them, governments to allow it's use, and the internet infrastructure to allow you to perform transactions.  All of those activities are outside of your control as a person who is storing value, thus, they represent counterparty risks to you.

This may be the kind of thing I love the most about BTC.  We can watch live when incredible sums of money are consolidated and transferred.  We can know from where and to where they go.  
This knowledge is valuable, extremely valuable.  That was probably a payment to consolidate a new venture, or purchase an existing asset.  Smart people will be able to figure out what it was for, and invest accordingly.

This is the true moral hazard of a deflationary currency.  If BTC value is always rising against items in the marketplace (like a PC) then you'd be an idiot to ever spend your BTC. However, if the velocity of BTC drops because people hold it, it will not stabilize as a store of value.

No, but you can borrow on their value, and spend that.

2 weeks? 
Meanwhile, in the real world, people might want to be able to buy things without waiting for hours.

Until 21M people do this.

Dollar = inflationary, as such, you are rewarded for spending it now, because it will be worth less later.  This incentive to spend drives commerce.
Bition = deflationary, as such, you are punished for spending it now, because it will be worth more later.  This incentive to hold it, stifles commerce.
Comparing the adoption of Bitcoin to the adoption of the Dollar is not genuine because they are two different asset classes.

It's in a hyper deflationary phase moving towards stability.  It's truly awesome to think about different scenarios.  Everyone talks about how they wish they had bought three years ago.  I don't hear too many people talk about how they wish they'd taken out a loan for a house in BTC three years ago.  The deflationary nature of the currency means consumer credit is a thing if the past if it gets adoption.

If the market cap worked out to 1% of all global wealth (estimated at $240T), that would mean $2.4T market cap for BTC / 21million max coins = $114k/coin?  I'm doing that math in my head, so it's probably off by a decimal place or something  Of course, in the short term, there are fewer coins and global wealth will likely grow over the next 140 years while remaining coins are mined, both of which would drastically effect the price.
