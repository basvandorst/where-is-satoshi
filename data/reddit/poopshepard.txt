Thank you.  I've honestly never heard of inflation described as a positive in that way.

Why not!  Congratulations, man!

There's been no gain or loss on your investment, so no.
My limited knowledge is you mark the date and price you bought it, and then compare that to when you sell.
You pay either long or short term capital gains on it, or if you lose you can claim capitol loss.

That exchange has the worst reliability.
Their website is extremely verbose and complicated to navigate as well. 
Garbage service.  There's too many other better choices.

It's been a garbage experience.
Did you know they use cloud flare? I do,  because I see that fucking error screen. Every. Time. I. Go there. 
Not to mention their account signup process.
Pick an email. Got it.  Ok, now pick a fucking username.  A username?! Why do I need an email and a fucking user name?!!  Makes no fucking sense.
Click this link to verify and activate account.  Ok, click link: 404.  Click link: Cloud flare error.
Stupid fucking website. Not getting a cent of my money.  Seriously.
They need serious UI help.  It's fucking stupid and awful.

He said the IRS was useless, not taxes.  You're doing a wonderful job shitting all over this discussion.
