Well, then use a web wallet to backup the broken ledger wallet using your 24 word seed  and transfer your funds to the new ledger.
The 24 word seed can be used to generate the private key and can be used on many wallets, not just ledger FYI ✌��

I’m not 100 percent sure, but I think it only pertains to individual transactions over 20k. So if you transferred a sum from cb to a  wallet or if you sold through coinbase/gdax.

Think of it more like a store of value somewhat unfettered by local/national financial manipulation and truly on a global scale. It makes a savings account obsolete. Takes out the "middleman." As far as using it for day to day transactions in a country that does not have the infrastructure and/or wealth distribution to accommodate such a use case, paper money will probably continue to be used for the foreseeable future, at least as long as the state that issues it remains "credible."

Because people are willing to pay more than that. Simple. That’s how markets work ��
Reasons for this could be: speculation, hedging, and yes, for a small albeit growing group of people, commerce. 
In places with high inflation rates, using it as a store of value, like a savings account, is especially useful for obvious reasons.
The real “value” is in the security and that is what makes bitcoin head over heals ahead of anything else. This is because of the size of its network, which is a truly decentralized web that spans the globe and thus makes it virtually impermeable to attacks. As more and more people realize this and as more and nation states begin to turn to crypto to move money across boarders and subvert “sanctions” the increasing scarcity of the asset will reflect demand. Right ?��

Yes; but, aside from not receiving the coins, your account will be banned from using coinbase in the future. Not the end of the world, but could be inconvenient depending on where you live.
