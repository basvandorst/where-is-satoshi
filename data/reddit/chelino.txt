Welcome to the addiction.  
It starts out with a podcast or two... maybe a youtube channel.  Then it gets more sinister, you start downloading bitcoin ticker widgets on your phone, you check the exchanges 10s of times a day, you begin talking to your grandma about investing in bitcoin... and then, then, you realize, this stuff is far cooler than you could have ever imagined.

It's down to 1,340k to btc now.  If I had sold 10btc at lunch time ( and bought back right now (dinner time) then I would have netted 600k profit.  I'll let it slide this time but next time our exchange shows this much of a difference from the rest of the world, I think I'll sell and buy back.
As an aside, I didn't realize there were so many of us bitcoiners in SK.  Maybe we should start our own sub.

7000cny is nothing.  8888 will have a real psychological punch.

South Korea checking in (3:30am local time, I wake up freakishly early).
We're at 1,240,000krw per btc on Korbit
We've already passed the 1k mark here hours ago.  China too from the looks of it (&gt;7000cny).
The real psychological number to watch out for is 1btc=8888cny, or 8080cny.  As I recall, 8's are considered lucky.  8 sounds like 'ba' similar to 'fa' which means fortune.  When btc hits 1,280usd to btc we can expect fortunefortunefortunefortune.

Fellow Korbiter here, first I'm hearing of Yapizon.
I'll ask my local buddy if he's heard of it, he always tells me what the K-forums are saying but I've never heard him mention Yapi.
