No, I did not deposit any bitcoins to Coinfloor.
I just made one deposit of GBP 1000 via UK bank transfer (from my own bank account) in January after they decreased their minimum GBP deposit.  I used that GBP 1000 to place orders.
I have been using the same ISP since 2017 to login, I do not hide my IP. The bitcoin address for withdrawal is to my own wallet. 
Where is my risk to them?

Got the email on April 2nd  below:


















Sent a reply to their ticketed support asking why my account was closed on the day I placed 2 buy orders and an attempt to withdraw 0.3 BTC. Never received any response from them and they have now marked it solved after sending the email below on April 3rd to me:














My trading pattern has not changed since opening the account back in 2017. The only thing I can think of was they were not happy with the 2 buy orders I made on April 2nd because that was the only time I had to opportunity to make two BTC/GBP **9% arbitrage** trades. Image if I had GBP 10K or 100K what they was do with my account.
