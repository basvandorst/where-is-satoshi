I copy and paste this link everytime I see a shitpost on twitter/fb/forums discussing ponzi/bubble/scam. Every person that doubts bitcoin thinks they are the first to predict its demise.

Also to OP please define what you mean technically by "bitcoins true value" and "in the near future".  I'll then tell you if bitcoin is in a bubble.

Honest question from someone trying to learn.  Are reddit subs the “Wall Street Journal” of cryptocurrencies?  I mean can a post here sway the price of bitcoin or other cryptos? 
 The only reason I ask is because billions of dollars are on the line and someone named bojangles can sway that? This is not meant as a negative. Just asking.

To sum this up. Did anybody truly think those that are in power and have extreme wealth would let some globalized decentralized currency make a bunch of message board posters become irrationally rich?

Honest question from a noob. 
This meme got me thinking that if amazon really wanted to, they could purchase a large amount of bitcoin. I'm talking x% of the entire currency and then announce the next day that they were going to accept bitcoin and moon the price?  It really wouldn't be insider trading because bitcoin isn't regulated under the same terms as amazon stock.  Is this possible or legal?

Philosophical Question. When does Hodling become indifference?
