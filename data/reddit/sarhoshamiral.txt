Ideally yes but in reality given the greediness of financial companies, I expect seller to be charged a transaction fee and buyer to be charged a conversion fee. So it won't be a non issue, also you have to think about uneducated people, older generation where it would be much harder for them to constantly think about different currencies where one shop sells in BTC, another in LTC, another in USD etc. I don't want to constantly use my phone to convert between currencies to see what I am actually paying.

Really? I really don't want to imagine the hassle of dealing with different currencies for each task. It would cause a lot of unnecessary complexity to daily tasks and mostly cause lower income in low/medium income families due to that misknowledge, complexity and fees associated with that complexity.

It is a free currency market today, no one is really forcing people to trade in USD. 
But even if there wasn't a official currency, the government will always have a preferred currency they deal with it and expect taxes to be paid in that currency (or to be converted to that currency) so that process is more streamlined and cheaper. Thus over time there is a good chance, that currency will be the preferred one going back to a single currency model.

I could easily see it being different from location to location, there is no need to hold cash at the branch if there are few cash withdrawals in a normal week.

It would be very naive to think that Bitcoin is safer than credit cards regarding fraud. Once the transaction is done in Bitcoin there is no way to get your money back, in credit cards if your card is stolen in majority of the cases you are not liable for any of the purchases. 
So I would say credit cards are definetely a safer choice from fraud point of view.

The default option should be automatic, I don't know if there is an option to change it to ask everytime but I disagree with asking first as default. Note that most users are not computer savy enough to know if they should remove it or not, so it is best to remove it automatically since we are talking about malware here. If you asked the user, I am pretty sure most would have said no or cancel to quickly dismiss the message box.

I thought signing up with Coinbase also required SSN though at some point for verification. That's the simplest way to get bitcoin for most people right now.

It was badly implemented in Vista but not in Windows 7. Unless the software you are running was badly implemented there were few legitimate cases that required admin escalation.

You can set Windows to ask for a password as well. But a lot of people complained when asking a password was made the default setting so I think in Windows 8, the default was just a notification. 
Trutfully most people will blindly enter their password anyway so it won't matter if admin escalation asks for password or just a simple button click.

How would have Bitcoin be different there? You must have given your card number at some point which means they asked for prepayment, in bitcoin case they would probably ask for the amount at that point so you would still be out 500.
The problem is that card number was handed out before anything was actually due.

You make it sound like it is not in a company's best interest to fix things quickly for their product. With the same logic one can say closed source is better because a company would have dedicated people to fix the issue as quickly as possible or even detect them at development time since any problems would impact their income. There is no guarentee that someone will fix the bug in an open sourced product. 
In reality though critical issues in either cases do get resolved quickly since they impact many machines world wide. The real problem usually lies with distributing the fix around, especially to personal machines where people do not apply updates on schedule.
