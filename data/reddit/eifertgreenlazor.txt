I mean why aren't alien hunters storming Scientology headquarters?  Xenu's artifacts and his aliens are there.

Awesome job.  Paid $1 for a bag of cool ranch doritos.  Although spending $50 for a bag seems too much.

Is it really a time paradox? Who is Satoshi and where are the Bitcoins he mined?

Thanks for letting me know.  Time to sell.

If you invested $1900 into gold 100 years ago you would have about $150000.
If you invested $1900 into $BTC 100 years ago you would have about $0.

The real question is how do we know this guy didn't use social engineering to hack someones accounts.  Then this hacked person decided to store passwords and account information in emails to themselves.    He then found they used the same 3 words in their password and 3 random ones and stored it on a linked email leading to a large goldmine.

For those who invested around 19k a tax deduction could have been better . . .
