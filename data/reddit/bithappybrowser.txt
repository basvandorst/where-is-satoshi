They are doing it because they know like a lot of us that segshit is of no benefit to the scaling issue. You need bigger blocks and NO segshit, which is why we have Bitcoin Cash that works like Bitcoin is supposed to.

thank you for your deep alternative analysis of what I am saying. As you cannot argue intelligently against what I am saying you resort to animal behaviour, which is why you cannot discern the truth.

For all newbies : Bitcoin is a deflationary currency. It is built in to its code so it will always go up over time. The best thing you can do is buy as much as possible and not listen to the shit advice given here by most "Don't invest more than you can afford to loose" - this is the worst advice you could ever take on.

My opinion has nothing to do with speculation. It is a FACT. You find that difficult to understand, but that doesn't change it. If you really understood what Bitcoin was, you would also know this to be a fact.
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:34:59
Still missing the point. Bitcoin is digital CASH.
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:46:34
Roger is 100% right. The best thing for Bitcoin is low fees and larger blocks. What he has done in the past is irrelevant to that.

An understanding of Bitcoin.

Cash does mean instant payment at zero cost to everyone else on the planet, but not to you.

The Indian cash crisis demonstrates to the Indian people the cancer of central banksters and government. By using Bitcoin they can eradicate the financial disease that is stealing from them every day.

Http://BitHappy.co.uk enables anyone to buy and sell goods and services with Bitcoin. It turns an Android device into a Bitcoin Point of Sale system and can turn any business into a self service store just like Amazon Go.

All we needed was a block size increase and we would have low transactions fees. fast confirmation times and no need for Bitcoin Cash. AXA have destroyed the whole point of Bitcoin and until there is a more competent development team and no censorship Bitcoin will be held back. Bitcoin is meant to be Electronic Cash first. The store of value was only created because of its use as a money.

He is 100% right, which is why you only attack him only on a personal level. Everything he says about the fees and blocksize is correct. He is truthful about Core Devs being happy with high fees and Bitcoin is designed to be used as cash.

A transaction is valid when it's broadcast over the network. 
It's just not 100% irreversible yet.
So Bitcoin works just great with 0 confirmations as a payment system in most cases and this will be the norm in the future. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 17:54:57
no, BitHappy is not a bitcoin wallet and stores no private keys
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:22:45
The point of Bitcoin is to eradicate the parasites of banksters and government, as it is outside of their control. By buying Bitcoin you become a warrior for light.
@_date: 2016-07-13 07:54:23
Already done working and feasable. Checkout BitHappy the Bitcoin Browser where you can make micropayments for anything.
