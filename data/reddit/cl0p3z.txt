Assuming there are no delays (you pre-order now and you get the machine on September 2014 as promised) the money that you will get with this won't even pay the bills:
This is a net loss.

No! Seems most people have no idea how GPG works. 
Anybody can fake the creation, name and email address of a key and upload it to any keyserver. They can also sign any key with it.
And this means nothing.

Yes they did, but the current system considers that (debt) legal:

If MtGox is bailed out and gets new management it can start with confidence renewed.
People are not afraid of the MtGox name, but about the incompetence of the current CEO.

And this (government, force) is only worth as much as you believe than in a collapse situation it will work. If a collapse situation happens, maybe the government step ups to backup the dollar with force, or maybe not. And believing on that is a matter of faith. So....
Gold is a real thing: you can touch it. The only real thing on dollars is the paper that are made of (which is worth zero)

Mining bitcoins is not longer profitable, and mining altcoins (litecoin for example) is not going to be profitable for much time.
I would suggest you to forget about mining and start thinking about starting a business around bitcoin.
For example, you say that is difficult to send/receive money from/to Dominican republic. You can think about possible ways of using bitcoins to make that easier and cheaper, so you can just sell this service to people.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:38:39
Its fake! the signature don't matchs the key of satoshi 
The private key that match the message is [this one]( but this key is by no means the key of satoshi. Is just the key of some guy that is right now laughing at you. The creation date can be faked very easily. You guys are being trolled in ways I couldn't believe possible.

Of course you should encrypt your wallet with a strong key and cypher, that way even if someone steals it, he can't do anything with it.

The metadata of the PDF says the creation date was "Thu 20 Feb 2014 10:13:43 CET" (that is GMT+1) and the software used was "Mac OS X 10.9.1 Quartz PDFContext".

I think that the lack of a reputation system is a big error.
A reputation system is essential for buyers that care about a good product and service. Without it, they won't be able to find the right seller, or they will fear that they are going to get a bad deal.
For example: When I buy something at ebay, I know I'm covered from scam if I use paypal to complete the transaction. But If I can chose between several sellers, I always choose the one that has most positive votes. The reason is that the buyer not only cares about getting what he pays for, but he also cares about getting it quickly and about getting a good product. He is also interesting in reading reviews about the thing or service he is going to buy.

This is a fallacy. Of course it is clear that the prediction is less accurate with longer time intervals, but people don't care about that.  A miner is only interested in a short time interval (&lt;1year), that is where the prediction is more accurate.
Also, TGB not longer predicts the difficulty increase in months steps, but in 2-weeks steps (just like the bitcoin network).
I doubt you can make better predictions.
