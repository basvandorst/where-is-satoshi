Article from January. No relation to Bitcoin.

Every single shitcoin has 100 million, if not a billion marketcap. Of course everything is overvalued by 100x, *still*.

unkillable and proven to never die? gold.
some new tech thing? not gold. im not saying bitcoin sucks or anything, but that gold comparison is pathetic.

well an index at least gets there. listen to tone for instance. he thinks you guys could go down to 1k ��.
that would be yet another 80% destruction.

They're scammers.

Why is it then so frowned upon, if I just have faith and thats it?
With full confidence, I dont hold any Bitcoin right now. Why would I? Im kust losing my money short-term. That doesnt mean I think itll never come back or that I think its terrible.
But its overall sentiment here, that you have to own Bitcoin to believe in the tech, which just isnt true.
I wont be buying any for at least 3 months, because the bear market needs to play itself out.
Truth is, pardon me, you re the minority. People are not in it for the tech, they re religious fantatics almosz, praying the price goes up, because really, thats all Bitcoin is good for. Speculation.

Day trading and trading are two entirely different things. It's not hard to spot, when stuff is going down, by simple RSI methods. Swing trading. I'm buying in, when it dumps again. Then I will buy. When all of you have lost hopes, that's when I buy in. 


So I should buy, knowing I will lose? No. I won't. 


Did you miss the response? With whom are you writing and with what do you agree? We don't agree with anything. Now is a terrible time to enter still, because the bear market will continue. I'm shorting Bitcoin, if I *was* to actually do anything with it. 
HODL is a stupid, put your head into the sand and scream lalala, while ignoring everything that's happening. Adhering to HODL will never yield you anything, if you do not eventually take your profit out of it. 


It isn't. It will take many more months. With a bear market, people gradually lose money on their shitcoins, leading to a higher Bitcoin dominance, because nothing else in Crypto matters, but Bitcoin. 
I'm buying in, when Bitcoin is low, and has a 60% or higher dominance. That's when the market will look more juicy. And a juicy market deserves my money, not a foul market, where 60% of the people, like right now, is invested into scams, because they think their shitcoins do anything. I will buy in, when dominance is peak-point. The higher the dominance, the jucier the market. 


How far is that away? 5 years? 10? It's not now and it's not even close to be useful for anything, besides speculation and making yourself some money, if you know how to trade. It doesn't do anything, I can't buy anything with it. I have time and I can see the infrastructure expand, without having to play the "I support store X, because it allows me to buy in Bitcoin". 
The only real use Bitcoin had, besides speculation, was when people actually used it for the Blackmarket to buy drugs. But people use Monero for that now, so that's also gone. 
I'm happy you entered at a good price, like 2300€. But do not spread the propaganda and make other people buy Bitcoin, when they will just lose money with it and may not be able to handle it. You know, some people actually bought at 20k. Som actually bought at 14k. Hell, some people actually bought at 10k. What's with all of these people? 
Shilling is bad. Always. Do that kind of shit IRL and people might in fact kill you, because you made them poor. I'd be careful. Nobody needs to know you own Bitcoin. That was the original purpose of it anyways. But all of that is gone too. 
*Spread it* is the overall mantra now. Why spread it? 
Why not focus on making the god damn thing better instead? Expand the infrastrucutre, if you're liking the tech so much. Spreading your shitty grad propaganda doesn't help anyone.

Or you re a trader, not willing to sink in the beat market.

About the tech? So why exactly do we even need the price to go up?
Check the sub and its threads. Price is everything.
Sometimes I wonder, do people even know Bitcoin functions exactly the same, whether its 10 or 10000 bucks?
But ye, we here for tech yo. Thats why nobody here cares who buys Bitcoin, so long as they buy Bitcoin. :)
All it is good for, for at least 5 more years,  is make smart people rich, which is fine by me.
The people buying the next ATH? Oh boy, they wont like Bitcoin at all.
