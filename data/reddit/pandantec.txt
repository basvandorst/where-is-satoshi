I am completely at a loss for why you wouldn't just buy and mine litecoins if you are so worked up by the concept of capitalism. 
@_date: 2013-07-10 13:21:48
No, I got the point, I just didn't explain mine very well.
I am not a lover of friedcat either, but just because I don't love him doesn't mean he is going to give up his percent of the Hashrate. 
My point was that he must have put some thought into it himself, the profitable maximum... And I think he came up with a different number. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 14:43:51
No I think that the efficiency will start to level off pretty soon here. KNC's hardware will be way more efficient than friedcat's hardware, and KNC starts at $2000 sure it is a lot but they will get cheaper when it is less profitable. 
Personally I think eventually all mining will be done in cold countries, as it would be okay to mine at a loss if you would be spending money on heat anyway. 
If there is profit in mining, then there is profit in mining hardware, and if there is profit in mining hardware, more manufacturers will get on board, more competition, lower prices. 
As I understand it, there isn't all that much further to go for ASIC technology to catch up to other chip technology... KNC working at 28NM? And I think other kind of chips can get down to 18 for the most advanced?

While I like your method for coming up with these numbers, I feel there are a lot of unknowns in there as well. 
Personally I would let friedcat do all the work. He has proven himself knowledgable. He has discussed getting 1 PH/s online by the end of the year. He has followed through on everything else, so why not this?
Now on top of that we know friedcat is smart enough to stick to his stated goal of only having 20-25% of the Hashrate. 
So we have a total Hashrate of 4 PH/s by the end of the year? I don't really think so, he will sell a lot of his hardware to keep from getting more than 25%. (Probably about halfish maybe?)
My estimate is your 1.2 for a minimum and 2 for a max.

What are the actual risks of accepting 0 confirmation payments?
It seems like needing more than a single confirmation is just drastically overkill for anything less than a several thousand dollars.

Because it's all about the percentage of the hashrate. If you want to earn a bitcoin a day you need to have 1/3600th of the network hashrate.  You already know about halving day, it's not coming as a surprise.  It is easy to reinvest more money as the hashrate goes up, to always maintain that 1/3600th. 
If I invest $7000 in a Jupiter only to have your $2000 worth of gpu's earn the same amount, you have undermined my investment by changing the rules. 
By changing the rules you will make the millions that BFL, KNC, Friedcat, Avalon, anyone else has spent on R&amp;D be worthless. 
If such a heavy handed approach can wipe out the investments in the above mentioned companies, why would anyone be interested in investing in any bitcoin business, if a rule change can wipe out their investments. 
Changing rules = devaluation
Edit: and I also really can't see how scrypt could in any way avoid centralization, long term. The only way to have the level of decentralization you are looking for is to make mining not profitable. Profits = centralization.

Somebody should do some crowd funding to get satoshi to spend one satoshi from the genesis block, in which case all the bitcoins raised would go to the same address. 
If he didn't send anything by a certain date, everyone would get their coins back.

Thank you apple, for breaking your spell over me with your own idiocy.

You all are forgetting that friedcat doesn't just mine, he sells hardware at drastically higher than break even profits. Mining is only about half of dividends. 
Friedcat is not stupid, he will continue to pay out huge dividends. 
Also he did once say he doesn't think mining revenue will go down with halving, he figures fees will make up for it by then. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 12:21:02
Seems like people are just looking for a problem that isn't there. 
Capitalism. Capital. Mining equipment = capital. 
Pan for gold. Buy yourself a sluice. Sluice for gold for a while, invest in dredger. Dredge till you have enough for a drywash station...
Of course unlike bitcoins gold depends a lot more on where you live, but still, anybody can start at the bottom and work their way up. 
I think of mining like turning electricity into bitcoins. I would rather just pay a little more on my power bill (and not even, in the winter) than go through the whole exchange process. I don't see asics changing that. 
Yeah asics might be expensive, but so are gpu's.
What did all the gpu miners do with their profits till now? What does capitalism reward? Reinvestment. 
Oh yeah and also, isn't KNC planning on making a scrypt fpga miner? Won't the technology evolve no matter what, always leaving behind those who refuse to reinvest?

I believe satoshi was still around at the time. The foundation didn't really have as much of an official structure. It is April 2011. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 14:51:45
On the other hand though:
If you were to make all the investments that hardware companies have put into their R&amp;D worthless, well then I just can't really see a future in bitcoins... Or any other crypto currency for that matter. 
If you want scrypt, buy litecoins, but you can't take miner's share of the Hashrate without a fight or devaluing the currency.

Last year I heard about bitcoins, liked the idea so I bought $100 worth. Paid for a year VPN and forgot about the change for a few months. Read about ASICMINER and invested in that, forgot about it for a few months. 
Recently sold it all for a Jupiter from KNC. 
That, to me, is priceless. 
@_date: 2013-07-06 09:55:25
But once you get it done, it is done. 
@_date: 2013-07-06 09:50:11
I suspect they will buy a few million dollars worth slowly, then try to sell them all at a time when it is difficult to get money into an exchange so that people have a hard time buying all the cheap bitcoins while people currently owning bitcoins panic sell to these people causing the hysteria.
Easy way to get cheaper bitcoins. I would have to wonder if the damage caused by it isn't permanent though. 
@_date: 2013-07-06 03:06:07
If there is an incentive to invest then you will have centralization. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 01:12:23
Quite the dystopian future when government start seizing asics.

In order for bitcoin to be successful it has to encourage investment. 
Discouraging investment based on a misunderstanding of the basics of economics would be a huge mistake. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 20:35:00
Uhmm... Why not just fill the machine with your own money, knowing that you could just smash the thing open and get the money back anyway?
@_date: 2013-07-06 17:42:50
I don't think the legacy banking system in our country, with its ogilopoly, would allow it any other way.

Here is Gavin Andresen in 2011 talking about how 'big iron' would be required for mining eventually. 38 min in.
 
He also spoke of mining as mimicking natural resource mining, like gold, which has specialized equipment.  
@_date: 2013-07-05 19:52:03
It will affect the price of bitcoin because all those hardware developers have spent so many millions on r&amp;d, based on the current pow. Change it and those companies lose it all.  
That hurts bitcoin because it would make other potential investors lose confidence in bitcoin. 
You can't change the rules in the middle of the game. Well, you can, but you aren't going to get the benefit you are looking for out of it. 
Also it seems like such a leftist thing to do.  I always thought bitcoins were such a bastion of the free market, this argument is the most anti free market talk I have heard since friecoins.

But what makes it so easy for a single entity to have so much influence?
Just because at this current moment in time it is easier to buy a gpu than an ASIC? And since asic manufacturers can mine, you think they wont sell them? Seems like a short term problem to me. 
Capitalism is the perfect lens to view it through. If mining is going to be profitable, smart investors will invest in doing more of it. Even if mining was restricted to CPUs, if it created a profit, you will just get data centres full of CPUs. 
What you are proposing is to punish people who have invested in bitcoin mining, because it is too profitable. They have spent their resources too wisely and you want to redistribute the wealth. 
Any major change will permanently hurt all crypto currencies because people buy under a set of rules. Change those rules and you will lose confidence. 
Edit: got a little off topic there, as far as decentralization goes, if mining is profitable, you will always get little guys in there trying to make a buck on their own. Always. Economies of scale or whatever. The bottom line is anybody can invest in mining equipment and if there is profit to be made, they will, and it will be decentralized, because the Internet and bitcoins are everywhere. 
@_date: 2013-07-06 11:40:26
Kind of off topic slightly. 
In the last week bitcoins on caVirtEx have been up to around 6% less than the mtgox price. This, even though the Canadian dollar is worth 5% less than usd. That's 11%, subtract exchange fee of 1.5%, and you have a good deal. 
Sometimes the arbitrage goes the other way, but I find bitcoin rewards the patient. 
Edit: I should elaborate this was after the mtgox price came down to the other exchange prices. Came to about 4.5% less than bitinstant at one point. 
@_date: 2013-07-06 10:48:43
No, scrypt will be exactly the same as sha. If there is a profit then smarter investors will buy more specialized equipment, will become more efficient, and will get larger. And the less smart investors will not continuously invest in new equipment, then complain about the centralization caused by scrypt...
What exactly is it about gpu's that makes you think they wouldn't be more efficient in a data centre full of them?
@_date: 2013-07-07 10:24:28
From Gavin Andresen in 2011:
You don't have a server in your home town or Satoshi's home town where this is all being stored? No, it's completely distributed at the moment. That will begin to change as we scale up. I don't want to oversell BitCoin. As we scale up there will be bumps along the way. I'm confident of it. Why? For example, as the volume of transactions come up--right now, I can run BitCoin on my personal computer and communicate over my DSL line; and I get every single transaction that's happening everywhere in the world. As we scale up, that won't be possible any more. If there are millions of bitcoin transactions happening every second, that will be a great problem for BitCoin to have--means it is very popular, very trusted--but obviously I won't be able to run it on my own personal computer. It will take dedicated fleets of computers with high-speed network interfaces, and that kind of big iron to actually do all that transaction processing. I'm confident that will happen and that will evolve. But right now all the people trying to generate bitcoins on their own computers and who like the fact that they can be a self-contained unit, I think they may not be so happy if BitCoin gets really big and they can no longer do that.

You would have to create your own fork, and call it communist coin. See how it turns out.
