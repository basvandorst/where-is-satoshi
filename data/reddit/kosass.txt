Uh , 
 
Although u can find it more if u check at his profile discussing about it during the earlier days at bitcointalk

I would think a change of algo would save the day no? This is a worse case scenario

? You must be a very optimistic person in ur everyday life? 
What FUD?  Its sad if u think that way and i hope you wont be in a situation in ur life that could be the worst case scenario since it will be odd if that happens

‘Unless some massive breakthrough ‘. I’m asking for the worse case scenario .  And sha 3 has already been made with that case in mind . But would btc be going for sha-3 or a differ route

Ikr , just quoting satoshi himself , but i really wanna know whats going to be the likeliest solution

Thank you for this

So basically an advantage in the mining has a higher chance of happening right now than sha-256 being compromised? 
How would that work in theory though ?  So basically  would that mean it would also be easier  for the person to do a 34/51 attack as well? 
And i really dont get ur last statement . So basically it would ruin decentralization for btc to migrate into another algo?

ill accept anything , but what does reddit gold do?
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:22:21
Anyone can copy facebook,reddit, or a structural design, but would anyone actually use it or says its better that the originaL?I would agree out of the 1072 exist, some would definitely fail, especially the one who just in it for the money. The intrisinc value is math, you could say the same for fiat currency , anyone can just copy the US dollar would it be the same?

you just said its a cool tech, does tech has no intrinsic value? yeah i do own bitcoin, i also own gold, and some other stuff whats wrong with owning something that from my perspective has value in it? You could also state that ,Do you own more "Programming skills" that someone who owns no computer? Or you could also say ,Do you own more "math" that someone who doesnt have a math textbook?

how is it a speculative mania? if you understand the basis of crypto, it is backed by math. algorithm,etc. I would rather invest something that is easy to be used yet hard to be taken away from. Gold , Silver is just some piece of metal, that people think its shiny and give value to it. People give value to math, is it wrong to do so?

Are you perhaps an employee of JP Morgan?  or some bankers or idk?its pretty funny ,that everything you post is about you hating crypto,bitcoin ; bubble bla ,bla ,bla. Cant you just chill and see whats gonna happen next? U might be right, bitcoin would be worthless, but i know for sure blockchain tech would definitely stay.
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:42:06
I can say the same for anything really.
Bitcoin is a technology , a medium for exchange, would u rather exchange gold for rice? or some digital code for rice? The idea for bitcoin is to replace fiat, which in case if lets say the Koreans went to war, would their fiat would worth anything? but bitcoin would still be worth something unless its Post-world war 3 where possibly internet cant longer be access.
