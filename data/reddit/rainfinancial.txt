As u/swimfan229 mentioned, the keyword here is licensed. Rain is the first cryptocurrency exchange in the Middle East to earn a regulatory license and start operations. This is a key distinction, as regulation allows us to have stable banking, payment processing, and partner exchange relationships. All of which lead to better pricing and more liquidity for the Middle East.   
If anyone is interested, you can read the full CRA (Crypto-Asset) regulation that the Central Bank of Bahrain issued and the current license Rain has here: [

Thank you, we appreciate the support. As you mentioned, there is quite a debate on this topic currently. 
Rain earned its Sharia compliance certificate from a regulated Sharia compliance bureau in Bahrain. This required many Sharia compliance audits and them pouring through every aspect of our business. We will be working with other countries Sharia decision makers in the future to continue the education of cryptocurrency in the region. 
You can read more about this on our blog post announcing our Sharia compliance: [

From Bahrain, Rain is permitted to serve the entire Middle East (outside of sanctioned countries). This includes the GCC countries (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, UAE). We offer customers the ability to fund their account via bank transfer or purchase instantly with a locally issued debit/credit card.   
It is also Rain's mission to expand on its current regulatory reach and we have started conversations with many of the region's regulators.

This is correct and why we chose Bahrain as our headquarters.
