Would also add that these "nodes" have no economic dependency, they are just running blindly in AWS. Pretty useless. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 11:03:09
Yes, I agree! It is a problem that needs to be solved in my opinion and shouldn't be accepted.
Independent economic nodes that collectively have an influence on the network is exactly what is required to solve the problem of centralized economic nodes.
So to genuinely contribute to decentralization, the best thing you can do is use bitcoin / start a business that uses bitcoin and manage the node yourself. Encourage others to do this too!
It is not about the volume of transactions, this could be one or two a day. It is that if you are not able to run the node, you will suffer economically, and so shout about it! If there are 50,000 of you in this situation, miners will know they have to care about your interests and not just the interests of a few centralized wallets and services.
The problem with 50,000 volunteer relay-only nodes (not used for transactions) is that they aren't part of the economy, so don't account for any value. 50,000 * 0 is 0.

Absolutely , just yesterday my post was almost the top post, got to number 2 then just as it was about to hit he top, like clockwork, around 9AM EST it got 15 down-votes in a minute, shooting it to 10th place. This happens every time I post something related to our wallet.
@_date: 2015-06-06 06:21:58
I would, yes
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:21:14
I think you see them as soon as the article is posted as you are in the same time zone as the person doing it. The pattern I see is that I post outside his timezone and by the time he wakes up my post has usually managed to get near the top, so the torrent of downvotes is blindingly obvious. I even get texts from people asking what happened!
@_date: 2015-06-09 01:57:46
Distributed databases and cryptography are awesome and would be a great fit for banks to create private settlement systems. In fact there are probably some already out there. But what has this got to do with Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-06-03 14:12:57
Great stuff from BitGo
@_date: 2014-12-06 23:02:39
Do you mean "Web delivery of Cryptography and Javascript is not a great combination"?
If you download a desktop application such as a chrome app, which uses Javascript as it's language, it is no different to any other software. When you download it you can check that it matches the open source and then use it with some confidence.
With web delivery, every time you go to the site you could be served up different code, it's just that Javascript happens to be the most popular language for executing in a web browser. The same would apply even if the sites somehow served up c++ binaries.
@_date: 2014-08-21 02:25:10
if the transaction is being ignored by the miners, it is likely fee related..sometimes it can take 40 minutes for anyone to solve for a block though
@_date: 2014-08-24 00:05:32
We don't store any passwords. Only data that has been encrypted using your password on the client. Your password is never transmitted to our servers.
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:10:54
Because custody means custody in traditional banking. A 2 of 3 multi-sig wallet where by the wallet provider has access to only one key might still mean custody or it might not. It would be good to have advice on this. similarly with storage, banks encrypt customer details with their own keys, but if you allow the customer to derive their own keys, who is storing the data?
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:35:02
It's a cute idea

@_date: 2014-12-07 08:12:48
We do something very similar with Ninki Wallet,  you can hand off HDp2sh nodes to your contacts via PGP and generate addresses on behalf of each other, so that there is no need to exchange and address every time you want to transact.
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:04:33
Hi, Ninki Wallet just launched, 
It's free
We don't allow web access but we have a Chrome App which functions exactly like a website would.
We are 2 or 3 multi-sig where you hold 2 of the keys so we can't move any coin without your intervention.
2fa is mandatory. 
We have an Android app on the way, but not until early 2015.
Anyway, please check us out and keep us in mind for the future.
@_date: 2014-08-25 11:37:07
Yes, seems so. Looking back in the block history, it seems to be a regular occurrence. I learn something everyday.

The android app can be signed and as is only downloaded once, I believe with apple you are trusting them to an extent with regards to app integrity, but it is only delivered the one time via download from iTunes, so mitigates the risk of being manipulated on the fly.

All addresses are generated in the browser using 3 master public keys, one provided by us and two stored in your encrypted packet that only you know the password to. The addresses are generated and passed to us to monitor the account balance. So we never have to know any of your public keys.
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:17:27
Yes, it is a mess, I was gobsmacked at how badly they approached this. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised. There is no way I'm going to stop. this is the first of many to come, as you said there are plenty of safe havens around the world for all kinds of businesses, especially in banking (normally only available to the rich)

@_date: 2014-07-19 15:26:10


the banks have complete control over those funds in both situations.
a 2 of 3 multisig where the user has 2 keys gives them complete control
@_date: 2014-07-18 11:36:50
We need clarification on whether storing an encrypted private key to which you do not know the encryption key is classed as storage of vc, securing vc. Also wrt multi sig, how does this work with the definition of custody of vc. For example holding 1 of 3 on a multi sig vs holding 1 of 2. What is custody?
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:01:26
Yes, I need to find out if this would hold up in court..again lawyers cost money!
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:16:23
Thanks for the feedback, I am a big fan of what you guys are doing at Hive. I'll read through those links today. I am totally open to collaboration / idea exchange etc. was talking to the guy from GreenAddress about this earlier. Ultimately I see the wallet and making Bitcoin simple to use as the gateway to much more exciting products, with the wallet itself the first layer of this, so interoperability between wallets would benefit everyone I think. Cheers
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:34:54
I'm no expert, but I felt like it was too easy for people to build up their reputation with small loans and then go for a big one and disappear. Of course it is very hard to then get your Bitcoin back (there is an arbitration process I believe). If they use fake id's and build up a reputation, there is not a lot you can do. With fiat p2p I guess everyone has to have a bank account and so there is more of a feeling that if you try to scam people you will be tracked down.
I think there is a big future for p2p lending with Bitcoin but I'm not sure it can follow the same model as the fiat ones currently do.

It is true that this will hurt adoption, I will probably run a website "demo" version of the site to showcase the features, but anyone running it from the desktop will have to download the app. 
It is a tough one, however my nightmare is ending up with a million users all using insecure browsers, no 2-factor and crappy passwords...I would rather have 50,000 users on apps, with 2fa enabled
@_date: 2014-09-05 04:41:30
Is that a joke?
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:29:06
After analyzing the risks we determined it just isn't good practice in terms of security. Software should be delivered as a one time install, plus updates when required and should be ideally signed by the software publisher.
There is nothing to stop a website sending you malicious code when you visit the site, or someone hacking that site and sending malicious code to the browser on every other request.
Chrome Apps hugely reduce these risks and many other associated with browser based code execution.
@_date: 2014-08-30 21:40:11
Yes, perhaps "no future" is a bit excessive.

Similar to Ninki Wallet and BitGo...
Actually are these for receive addresses only? How do you verify the hand-off of the extended keys has not been man in the middled?
Also, just as importantly, how are the extended public keys stored? are they stored encrypted by the user or by Coinbase?

Is SMS true 2FA? Something you know, something you own.
@_date: 2014-12-04 12:44:27
Possibly they are referring to their chrome apps, they are desktop as they don't require web delivery, so the code that is being delivered isn't massively insecure
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:14:16
But why should they be exempt? Crypto-currency is a very different beast than managing a centralized ledger or portfolio of assets.
@_date: 2014-06-10 13:12:39
Great question and one I really need feedback on...
The attack vector looks like this:
When "friending" someone on the site you pass them 3 public keys representing a multi-sig bip32 node in your public key space. These 3 keys are encrypted with the public RSA key of your friend and stored in our database ready for your friend to accept them and transfer them to his own encrypted packet.
But how do we know that a hacker (or us) haven't intercepted the process, encrypted a rouge set of keys( that will generate addresses we own) with your friend's public RSA key, and he has downloaded them into his packet. The first time he generates an address it will be the hackers address and not yours.
So what we do is: you, in the browser, do a sha256 hash of your friend's RSA public key concatenated with the 3 genuine master keys. 
So the hacker would have to generate 3 public keys that when hashed with your friends RSA public key, gave the same results as the genuine set - he does not know the genuine set.
The verification code is generated by picking 4 characters from this sha256 hash, the logic of which is determined by the last 2 characters. So the hacker also has no idea which code will be selected.
Your friend generates the code from his RSA key concatenated with the 3 keys he received, 256hashes and uses the logic to generate a valid verification code which he passes to you offline to use as verification.
You then verify this against what you originally sent.
We could use the entire 256 hash but I wanted to make it easy to exchange the code by phone or face to face.
If you can see holes in this please let me know as it is the key thing that makes the whole "address-less" bitcoin system possible.
@_date: 2014-12-07 03:33:12
Coinbase last I checked had full insurance for their online wallet (3% of its funds), Circle appears to have full insurance, but would need to investigate to find out if this applies to online and offline funds or not.
No-one is insured against user error, however- this is only insurance against an internal employee theft or hack of their servers

I agree with most of your points, but blockchain.info came up with the basic idea of encrypting on the client and indeed the whole concept of a trustless service, they were the first and should be respected, however they shouldn't rest on their laurels and I am happy the community has made them realize this.

It is crucial to abstract away the details of Bitcoin. Addresses, HD wallets, multisig, change addresses, transaction hashes. These are all things that you don't think about at all with other payment methods.

In the background when you Add each other as contacts there is an exchange of PGP keys. This Ninki phrase is the fingerprint of your PGP public key. The reason you have to validate is to confirm that the keys haven't been tampered with during the exchange.

We see this service and probably more to follow as the base-line on top of which to build more exciting products that could be revenue generating once mainstream adoption happens, but at this stage, I don't think any completely on-chain wallet can generate revenue, let alone profit.

A third party who can act as an authorized countersignatory but does not have control of the funds as they only have 1 of 3 keys- and 2 are required to spend. So they can provide similar (and better) wallet functionality than Circle/Coinbase without taking custody of your coins.

They key point is, he does not know the genuine keys because he doesn't have your friends private RSA key to peek at what you have sent. He can only encrypt his own set. The only question is if the 6 digit method is strong enough or if we should use the full sha256 
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:55:37
can you elaborate on this? I can't find it in the document.
@_date: 2014-08-24 00:08:34

Only the addresses on the node you allocate to the person, which you would have to give to them the normal way in any case, only every time you wanted to transact (assuming you don't reuse addresses)
@_date: 2014-07-06 12:41:12
Yes, once we get into beta testing in mainnet. The current wallet should scale to your phone browser.
@_date: 2014-06-09 22:17:48
A better solution to this would be an online multisig wallet with the wallet provider delaying broadcast for 10 minutes with the opportunity for you to cancel the transaction if you realize the address is wrong. This is something we will implement in the final version of Ninki Wallet- currently in alpha testing 
Any feedback much appreciated

That is correct, of course your username can be a pseudonym, all addresses are multi-sig BIP32 and we have copies of the master public keys on the server which we use to verify addresses and validate transactions before we countersign. 
This means we can validate that the address on the transaction belongs to the contact you think it does, and hasn't been replaced by malware etc. 
It also means that we can be sure which keys have signed off on a transaction, and also provides a way for the user to prove they are the owner of the private keys to us, should we need to reset two factor authentication or other such requests.

Ninki Wallet is experimenting with a wallet open pgp network to try and solve this problem. It also prevents a man in the middle attack during the address exchange, which could easily happen if people are constantly emailing or IMing addresses to each other.
Details are on the site below, but basically it is a multi-signature deterministic wallet which allows you to designate nodes to your contacts, allowing them to seamlessly generate addresses for another party.
The wallet itself is in alpha testing on the Bitcoin testnet

cool, i'll give it a go!
@_date: 2014-07-19 17:21:22
Understood. One last thing, can safety deposit boxes be seized under the legal theory of abandoned property? How does that happen if the bank does not have custody?
@_date: 2014-12-12 04:42:41
Ninki Wallet will launch iPhone  and Android apps in January, after the news yesterday we will do a windows phone version too...
@_date: 2014-08-15 11:11:41
I have an alpha version that uses chain.com, will get it on GitHub tomorrow and send you the link
@_date: 2014-08-23 15:22:56
Thanks for the feedback. We plan to develop a native tablet/phone app which will solve these issues. Unfortunately browser/javascript on mobile devices is still quite slow.
@_date: 2014-08-15 08:04:37
check out  (currently Beta)
We have most of those features plus many more
@_date: 2014-06-09 13:03:43
It is a a multi-sig wallet like BitGo, but I believe this is the first that lets you send to each other without dealing with addresses via Bip32 nodes. Libraries we use bitcoinjs on the client and raw crypto on the server using BouncyCastle libs
Sure, all accounts will be deleted as this is just a testnet version. If you drop me a message with your username I'll delete it after you are done. Cheers!

The RSA keys are for encrypted communication between users on the site to allow exchange of public keys for address generation and invoices for payments. I looked into using ECDSA but although it can be used for encryption the consensus seemed to be that is was geared towards signing and best practice was a set of signing keys and a set of encryption keys. RSA seemed a good choice for user to user encrypted communication
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:33:09
good point, I have updated to include feedback on the exact reasons and I agree the bar shouldn't disappear, i will add this to the bug list. I think the "123" being weaker is because some hackers generate words + 123 as it is such a common thing for people to do that "normal123" would be used as a password more than "normal", i.e. 123 could be though of less than a single character in terms of an attack
@_date: 2014-08-15 08:00:21
Thanks for the plug!
We have actually just gone live on mainNet so please check it out.
there is a new demo video which showcases the invoice features of the wallet network too.

Thank you! Let me know your username if you didn't already and I'll send you some coin to test with.

We just launched Ninki Wallet, a HD multisig wallet which allows you to build a payments network using PGP. Our next goal is to release mobile apps and over the next few months build enough trust within the community to get accepted onto Bitcoin.org "choose your wallet" section and become one of the main wallet players.
Cheers, and nice post.
@_date: 2014-12-07 08:08:07
Check out Ninki wallet, this is similar to what we do. You can build your own network and hand off HDp2sh nodes to your contacts via PGP and an out of band verification. Then you never need to exchange Bitcoin addresses again, and 0 address resuse.

@_date: 2014-06-10 21:11:28
Please have a look at Ninki Wallet (BIP32 / 2 of 3 multisig)   it is an alpha test on testnet. We don't have coin join but we have system where we allocate a node in your bip32 address space to each of your "contacts" on our network. 
Would really appreciate any feedback on features we should add etc. If you add ninki as a contact after you sign up I'll send you some test coin
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:59:01
The hot wallet is insured..around 3% of the funds normally. If their cold wallet gets hacked, there is no recourse AFAIK
@_date: 2014-09-02 06:07:34
This is not decentralized , the contacts are stored on a server, although all private keys are encrypted on the client by you and communication between you and your contacts is done using PGP, so the server can't see your private keys, invoice details or messages.
@_date: 2014-08-24 00:55:11
Your password should be at least 10 characters long and have a combination of symbols, letters and numbers, with no sequences eg. 123
Something like this:
there are lost of password managers out there, that will enable you to have a single master password and generate a strong password for every site you visit. All you need to remember is the single master password.
LastPass with a Yubikey is a good bet.
Also, always enable two factor authentication.
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:01:15
Thanks, very good point.
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:36:45
I'm guessing they contract janitors etc.
@_date: 2014-08-05 01:08:57
How is the transaction sent to the device for signing? Via the USB cable?
@_date: 2014-08-16 00:48:47
Thanks for the feedback. Ninki means "popular" in Japanese and we are based in Tokyo, which is why we chose the name...
@_date: 2014-07-06 10:40:51
Thanks! Hope to test on main-net in around a month. The client side Javascript related to the wallet creation/passwords/address creation/signing etc. will be open source on GitHub and minified in the browser
@_date: 2014-09-12 22:12:27
This is the correct answer 
@_date: 2014-07-15 13:51:24
Any idea why? 
@_date: 2014-12-12 08:18:57
@_date: 2014-09-02 10:29:10
I have it scheduled to go in for Beta3, I already proto-typed it and like the bitcoinaverage.com API
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:29:27
Thanks, I found a big problem with the site which is now fixed. One of the main javascript files wasn't being downloaded correctly, so your account was created but there was a problem creating your encrypted packet.
Sorry, you will need to create  a new account, I really hope it works for you this time. Thanks very much for spending the time to test in any event, you have helped me identify a major problem :)
@_date: 2014-12-06 13:38:50
yep, exactly the same clothes, bag and sign...
@_date: 2014-08-30 14:29:00
I don't believe so, as I understand it you are basically trusting Apple to verify (I don't think they go into that much detail either), as an iPhone user, you are basically trusting Apple and the service, perhaps someone with more experience deploying to iTunes can confirm this?

We just launched this week. Ninki Wallet is a HD multisig wallet which runs as a chrome app, giving you a web UI but in a sandboxed environment and a signed delivery system.
It is a 2 of 3 multisig wallet with genuine 2fa required to countersign your transaction using the service.
@_date: 2014-07-06 04:28:26
Check out Ninki wallet, we solve this issue using a multi signature bip32 wallet network which allows us to validate the addresses are correct on the server side before we counter sign the transactions
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:23:10
yes, its a really technical but important question, and something the proposal doesn't touch upon. In my opinion we should be exempt as it is no different (we are even better i think) from  someone downloading or compiling bitcoin qt on their device and using a single key. A reasonable reg would be to comply with some kind of security audit, which I would totally welcome, and if passed you were able to operate as a Bitcoin software service provider. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 14:31:02
Interesting, how did this come about do you think?
@_date: 2014-08-25 13:40:55
Good point! But what is the miner doing in this scenario, avoiding pulling the transactions from the memory pool and saving some milliseconds? Are they gaining any advantage by not including any transactions?
@_date: 2014-06-11 04:07:40
Cool, thanks- the site currently runs on a regression testnet ( ie private testnet ) I wouldn't dream of going live on mainnet until I have had the security model verified, so really appreciate your advice. I will study the course you recommend.
@_date: 2014-08-23 14:42:58
Good point, will increase
@_date: 2014-09-27 15:36:20
Great service ... Well thought out and well executed
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:39:20
It isn't popular in Japan yet and the general population don't really know what it is. There is, however, a thriving Bitcoin community here in Tokyo and a surprising amount of connections to Bitcoin (quite a few Bitcoin business owners and ex-owners live here ;). Saying that there is only two ATMs for a country with a population of over 100m so there is a lot of work to do.
@_date: 2014-08-16 06:13:55
I had a look, but I don't have a backup unfortunately, yes, I think you were one of the first to signup so I didn't have email functionality available then...
@_date: 2014-12-06 13:37:06
apples and oranges, its supposed to be more of a high level sketch about trusting your private keys to someone...
@_date: 2014-06-09 13:31:40
The bar is telling you if your password is strong as you type. I will add more information to this. You should use a password with lower and upper case characters, symbols and no sequences like 123 etc. it should also be at least 10 characters
@_date: 2014-12-06 13:46:17
that's cool, by the way blockchain.info terms of service are here:
@_date: 2014-06-10 10:08:36
here is my verification code: 218e78
In the Network tab select the user ninki and enter this code in the Validation section
This will prove that the public/private RSA keys we used to encrypt our exchange of BIP32 master keys was not subject to a man in the middle attack.
The site will give you a validation code to give to me also.
@_date: 2014-08-25 02:45:32
One thing we are looking at is a way to add a contact via QR code (similar to the way Line does it) and hand off the phrase and the user name in the qr code at the same time. I still need to analyse this properly though.
@_date: 2014-08-30 21:53:28
I think he is referring to the fact that the chrome app won't run unless the signature matches the content. If I create a normal open source project, and have a checksum and sign the binary with my key, it requires the person downloading the binary to verify these things, if they don't bother they could launch a modified version of the binary left there by a hacker.
@_date: 2014-08-23 14:36:56
Will fix
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:22:58
Yes, I will look at doing this. PGP messaging app would be quite easy to build in, and could be very popular given the state of internet privacy these days.

It doesn't make sense, there are a whole new set of variables involved with crypto-currency, especially in terms of custody, storage and security that didn't exist previously. Slapping existing regs is ineffective (assuming they are trying to protect the consumer of these services) and need to be reworked from the ground up. I would expect they would end up being similar but with a lot of crypto specific caveats. Not just copy and paste
@_date: 2014-12-06 12:54:48

I asked one of their investors at the beginning of this year, he reckoned lots of exciting stuff on the way, I asked for some idea of when, and he kind of dodged it. They never seem to even do incremental updates, maybe a case of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:42:41
If you do a Crtl-F5 on the site and sign up for a new account again, it should work now. Sorry for all the problems and I hope it works for you next this time, it was a deployment problem :(
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:07:24
True. Though the US can be very aggressive in prosecutions, especially finance in NY has international clout. 
We are based in Japan so don't have the onshore problem. I sincerely hope all the VC moneyed start-ups on the west coast are booking flights to NY as we speak.

my bad, typo.
Can safety deposit boxes be seized under the legal theory of abandoned property? How does that happen if the bank does not have custody?
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:13:45
Yes, this is a decision when you design a wallet, does your balance reflect the outputs you own or the outputs you are able to spend at the given time. Once you have lots of outputs attached to your wallet this doesn't matter so much as it is likely that there will always be enough unspent outputs to spend in quick succession. 
In Ninki Wallet we are looking at implementing change fragmentation based on the normal transaction value for the user ( optional setting of course)
@_date: 2015-05-25 05:45:37
It isn't about breaking the law, I can be completely law abiding and have my funds frozen by a bank/service due to no wrong doing of my own, but because the services themselves have broken the law, deliberately or otherwise.
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:21:58
very interesting, will read the FinCEN docs before I submit my comments to Mr. Lawsky
@_date: 2014-07-15 14:22:05
Wait, I can't send to a multisig address from their wallet? That's interesting, so migrating to a competing multisig wallet would require moving from blockchain to qt (or some other) then out to the multisig wallet

@_date: 2014-06-10 23:12:25
Thought I would run it by you one more time, hopefully this is a clearer explanation. I have removed the 6 digit code step for now.
**The problem**
Two users Alice and Bob.
alice and bob each have a packet of data AES encrypted with a password only they know.
	AliceAESPacket
	BobAESPacket
The AESPackets contain an RSA key pair which they will use for encrypted communication with each other. The AESPackets also contains 3 Bitcoin BIP32 root public keys.
They will use these root keys to generate 3 derived bitcoin public keys whcih they will exchange with each other.
Their RSA public keys are available on a server.
**The exchange**
1. Alice decrypts her AES encrypted packet with her password, gets the root keys and derives 3 public Bitcoin keys for Bob
	BitcoinKeyForBob1 = Bip32Hot.Derive(node);
	BitcoinKeyForBob2 = Bip32Cold.Derive(node);
	BitcoinKeyForBob3 = Bip32Us.Derive(node);
2. She downloads Bob's RSA public key from the server and encrypts the 3 Bitcoin public keys using Bob's RSA public key.
	RSAEncryptedPacketForBob = BobRSAPublic.Encrypt(BitcoinKeyForBob1 + BitcoinKeyForBob2 + BitcoinKeyForBob3)
3. Alice creates a verification hash for what she has done.
	VerifyHashAlice = SHA256(BobRSAPublicKey + BitcoinKeyForBob1 + BitcoinKeyForBob2 + BitcoinKeyForBob3)
4. Alice posts the encrypted packet to the server and Bob is notified that it is available
5. Bob downloads the RSAEncryptedPacketForBob and decrypts with BobRSAPrivateKey
6. Bob then AES encrypts BitcoinKeyForBob1, BitcoinKeyForBob2 and BitcoinKeyForBob3 using his private password and stores in BobAESPacket
7. Bob creates a verification hash for what he has received
	VerifyHashBob = SHA256(BobRSAPublicKey + BitcoinKeyForBob1 + BitcoinKeyForBob2 + BitcoinKeyForBob3)
8. The RSAEncryptedPacketForBob is deleted from the server.
9. Out of band Bob and Alice compare hashes: 
	if(VerifyHashAlice == VerifyHashBob) {
		ExchangeWasValid
	} else {
		ExchangeWasInvalid
	}
10. Generating an address
	Bob decrypts his BobAESPacket using his password and derives an address for Alice using BitcoinKeyForBob1 + BitcoinKeyForBob2 + BitcoinKeyForBob3

I did fund 2 loans, one paid back early, the other one made one payment and is now almost 2 months late on the 2nd payment, I'm not expecting to get anything back. In my opinion their model is flawed.
@_date: 2014-06-09 13:41:45
what probably happened is you typed a normal word and then "123" or some sequence, the normal word was a "Normal" strength password, but the "123" made it weak, which is why the bar disappeared. I will make the feedback more informative- have added it to the list of bugs! thanks.
Regarding the social aspect, you can only be sent coins by contacts you have accepted. But you make a good point, that people could send you coins and you could have lost the password and not backed up the passphrases.
We will implement some features where by we won't allow anyone to send to you unless your account has been active for xxx ( a setting you control). We can also set limits on the amount you are allowed to receive from contacts etc. also controllable by you.
We also have  invoicing features which aren't switched on yet, which would allow you to only be sent money in response to invoice requests sent by you to them
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:20:24
Good call, it is on the list and will be in the next release.

@_date: 2014-07-19 14:13:19
I realize they did a copy and paste, but if they want effective regulation, it needs to be specific to crypto-currency. For example, if JP Morgan started mining Bitcoin, they would only be allowed to use up to 20% of the total hash rate or they would lose their banking license. These regs just say, hey! do what you want!
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:46:51
Try NinkiWallet, we take it a step further.
See the video demo here:
@_date: 2014-09-21 01:20:15
Correct, and all these public keys are required to generate the address, which is a hash of all the public keys concatenated with the integers n and m. The non-hashed version of this (the redeem script) is required to redeem the funds. A dummy transaction is created with this redeem script as the only input, this is what is signed and the resulting signature is appended to the redeem script on the actual transaction that will be broadcast.
Simple right?
@_date: 2014-07-14 11:27:49
Try the pin more than a few times unsuccessfully and your account gets locked. You unlock it via a validation code which is emailed to you. So basically not so safe, if your email is compromised you could end up in trouble. In any case their main product is their vault product. The initial set up is just on-boarding.
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:17:38
thanks for your advice. I will get to work on my comments tomorrow, (ideally i would have spent the day programming!)
I think every Bitcoin company/start-up/project should contribute to the process in a productive and non-confrontational manner, guess I was getting a bit down after working so hard on something then reading the regs.
@_date: 2014-09-07 22:29:14
I see, thanks for the clarification. It looks really good, I had bought an NFC kit with a view to do some experiments with Ninki Wallet and NFC, perhaps we can collaborate?
Would these devices have enough power to perform the elliptical curve math involved in BIP32 derivations I wonder?

@_date: 2015-05-25 04:57:21
The problem with the Case / 3rd key model, is that it is not censorship resistant. Both companies could be compelled to refuse to sign transactions en masse due to a shared client violating laws or regulations.
@_date: 2014-07-19 12:53:43
Yes, its a weird approach. they are essentially trying to regulate a software industry in the same way they regulate banks. Software industries live and breath innovation. Banking regulations are catch-all regulations designed to allow them to levy massive fines on hugely profitable oligopolies (basically taxation).  
@_date: 2014-07-06 12:49:25
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-08-30 21:36:05
The proposed method just removes problems unique to server based delivery of code to the web browser.  All software, open source or otherwise has the problem you mention, and in this instance depends on people verifying the signature and checking against the open source code.

How does the  "the funds automatically forwarded to a single 'hidden' address" work? Surely if it is on the public blockchain ledger, each customer can just follow the trail to the hidden address and see the total balance?

Yes, we cancelled the web version as our analysis determined the web is not a secure enough platform for delivering software. The fundamental problem is the javascript being sent down to the client can be changed at any point. 
Chrome apps provide a signed delivery system and so a sandboxed environment so you can have the usability of a web UI in a secure environment.

* Minor release in terms of features
- New accounts now use 128 bit  seeds for the EC keys instead of 256 bit
- Improved setting up Chrome App from mobile device
- Improved memory management
- Fixed display bug when sending invoices
- Code refactoring
- Identity codes no longer encoded
Edit: clarity on EC keys
@_date: 2015-05-08 11:18:38
Sorry, I should have been more specific, the keys refer to the seed for the Bitcoin keys, not the encryption keys.
The reason for reducing the size is that it means 2 * 12 word phrases to write down as opposed to 2 * 24 word seeds.
@_date: 2015-05-22 14:18:51
Thanks for pointing us out.
We do indeed do this (within Ninki) the key part is that the two contacts have to perform an out of band validation that the xpub key exchange was not compromised.
There is no reason why this couldn't be developed into a BIP, the main thing wallets would have to agree on is the method of key exchange.
I believe this will become a standard in the future and will remove Bitcoin addresses from the UI for a lot of cases. It also provides an extra level of security as you don't need to send addresses to each other (people often do this via unencrypted email and chat)
See my blog post here:
@_date: 2015-05-22 14:50:18
We implement this almost exactly as you describe in Ninki Wallet.
The key thing is the integrity of the xpub exchange, if someone can compromise the exchange they could replace the xpub with one of their own. We solve this by using an out of band validation which is done seamlessly via QR code scans on the ios and android apps and more laboriously on our Chrome App version.
@_date: 2014-07-06 12:47:06
No, it is not possible, they would be on different nodes eg. m/0/1000 and m/0/1001 and so would not know any information about nodes other than below them.

It's closed source. Who knows what it does...
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:13:51
obviously should be more like 1% but you get my point
@_date: 2014-06-10 05:23:44
Exactly right, the master keys are exchanged using RSA encryption then an out of band validation code can be used to verify there was no man in the middle attack. After that (a total of 5 clicks between the two parties) you can send funds back and forth with no need to exchange addresses, every transaction is done with a new address.

I actually make his point in the video when the moderator asks me about the Case model. I think Gem is a great idea however, multi-sig as a service with HSM modules at the backend with an easy API.
Also, the definition of Wallet will only be a temporary one I think, eventually signing and key management will be abstracted further to hardware and services. Of course if you want to do anything useful with Bitcoin before this is realized, then you have to build it yourself. Companies that have been building wallets over the last year or two will now attempt to move into revenue generating services (also discussed in the video)
@_date: 2015-08-28 10:29:56
Hi Gary,
So the site works by wallet "fans" sending bitcoin to various addresses. This is basically makes the wallet the preferred wallet, with the idea being wallets compete with each other for space. I was testing it out a while ago and sent a small amount of coin to the Ninki address which is why it keeps coming up at the top of the list.
I am not a big fan of the whole idea or the site in general. I've actually just submitted a pull request to be removed for now as I don't think it educates new-comers enough before the wallet selection process.
@_date: 2015-08-28 10:38:18
@_date: 2015-07-24 03:11:40
I think low fees can remain given it costs 100x plus to send money through the current banking system.
Instant transactions should clearly be removed, as while a couple of hours could be said to be "instant" compared to the multiple days the current banking system takes for international transfers, instant in this context implies seconds- which is clearly not true.
If there are any references to "secured by math" I would suggest they be removed also.
@_date: 2015-07-24 03:39:50
perhaps the word transactions should be removed so maybe: "low fees and fast confirmations"
@_date: 2015-07-24 04:10:49
I get feedback that there are  online retailers that wait for confirmations. In fact, I was trialing VPN services earlier this year and the two that accepted bitcoin, one waited for 1 confirmation, the other waited for 6.
@_date: 2015-07-12 07:38:31
I believe this is in the works
@_date: 2015-07-24 07:00:16
No, I haven't had any reports of this.
@_date: 2015-07-24 04:08:17
I get emails from people asking why their online purchases aren't instant and they have to wait for confirmations.
@_date: 2015-07-04 22:56:10
A better title might be: "what can we learn from"
@_date: 2015-07-24 03:52:51
It raises false expectations as when you come to buy something online, or some bitcoins in person you have to wait for 1-6 blocks, people are like "what? i thought this was supposed to be instant"
@_date: 2015-07-11 15:00:38
This is just a testnet prototype. Wouldn't go live with these features until a lot of mainnet hashing power is on full-rbf.
Correct, if it runs out of change will pull in an output. Also supports RBF-FSS, but this isn't really suitable for anything but a one time push as it ends up tying up too many outputs.
@_date: 2015-07-24 04:05:21
I think low and fast is fair, the main concern is lulling people into a false sense of security resulting in users becoming victims of double spends because they thought they didn't have to wait for confirmations
@_date: 2015-04-02 11:11:03
I would imagine their research will lead them full circle in this exact sense. Lets run a settlement system between 6 major banks on our private block-chain on our private network and each party can contribute to secure it via mining.
Erm, ok, why don't we just have a private network, share a database and have a legal agreement.
@_date: 2015-09-10 06:33:55
So good I read it twice. This is a really clear way to look at the problem and very well written. This will have me thinking for the next few days!
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:22:23
Hi, I actually agree with most of your feedback! Our plan for the next 3 months is to hugely improve the UX and onboarding process. Part of the problem is that Ninki was originally designed to create an account in the chrome app first, then pair your phone. I think this works quite well as you are at a desktop device, so passwords, keys and 2fa are not such a problem.
We released the mobile apps and realized that people want to sign up from the app directly. However the setup doesn't transfer well to mobile, this is something we are working to fix as a priority.
The other area we are going to fix is expaining what everything is with clear instructions on what to do with everything on the site.
Ninki, if anything, is a bit too secure for its own good at the moment :0
To answer your question about contacts and invoices, to add a contact you need to enter their user name in the chrome app and then exchange "validation phrases" via email or chat, or if you are both in person with the apps you can add with a QR code scan.
You are then able to send bitcoins without ever seeing addreses and create invoices for each other.
The irony is, once you have Ninki setup and working I think it is a great experience, but we have a hell of a lot of work to do in terms of setup.
We have targeted a June release for the improvements I have outlined, I hope you will check us out then...
@_date: 2015-03-19 16:21:36
Try Ninki Wallet for Android and iOS 
It also runs on the desktop as a chrome app.
@_date: 2015-03-18 09:36:51
The master public key is required in conjunction with the two private key backups to recover the funds. 
The P2SH scripts are derived from the master public key in the email and the master public keys corresponding to the two private keys that were backed up. 
All the P2SH scripts containing your funds can then be derived and signed with the 2 private keys to recover the funds into an another wallet.
The validation phrase can be exchanged with other users on Ninki. This allows users to build their own network and dispense with Bitcoin addresse exchange altogether. See my blog post on air-gapped address exchange.
By SPV I assume you mean SPV + single key wallet. this is a great model and I love and use Breadwallet, for example. The benefits are simplicity, a single phrase to write down and no dependence on a central server.
The downsides are , if someone finds your phrase, they have all the info they need to get all your funds. If someone grabs your phone they can spend all the funds with no account/velocity limits. 
An SPV wallet is a node in the network but doesn't have its own copy of the blockchain so relies on connecting to other nodes over the clear for its information. It also relies on the correct port being open, for example, on a wifi network, where it could also be subject to an MIM attack.
Using a service like Ninki allows for bigger things in the future, with a network of Bitcoin users who can engage in more advanced transactions with each other, this is what we are building towards, with the first application of this being a wallet counter-signing service.
Edit: It is on our list to explain all these things with ? icons in the phone apps and chrome apps. It is a major weakness at the moment, I realize.
@_date: 2015-03-08 15:37:15

Thanks for the report. I'm looking into it and will hopefully have a patch soon.
@_date: 2015-03-17 10:43:00
Thanks for the feedback!
We will probably add an advanced feature that allows a user to use their own PGP key at some point, then we could effectively integrate with PGP based identity services.
@_date: 2015-03-18 15:10:48
I wrote a blog post related to this :
@_date: 2015-03-21 13:14:43
It just does a basic check to make sure it has a good length , mix of letters, numbers and characters and no cycles like 123 or 789 etc.
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:23:27
To summarize:
- The account was created using the chrome app and two factor auth was setup as standard and keys were written down
- The phone was paired via the chrome app using 2fa to pair
- Google Authenticator was lost/removed from phone at some point (not entirely sure)
- The phone was then unpaired from Ninki due to incorrect PIN 3 times or manual unpair (I can't tell which)
- The chrome app couldn't be accessed due to lost 2fa
- The user was pointed to the recovery tool
I replayed the process with a new testing account and couldn't find any bugs.
Also, we have 2fa backup codes available in the Chrome App, so you can print these out and in the event you reset/lose your phone and Google Authenticator, the account can be recovered.
@_date: 2015-03-08 10:37:04
Edit: We have had reports that the PIN screen is not activating correctly on some devices. Clicking unpair and then cancel fixes the problem (Galaxy S5, Nexus 5)
A fix has been published for this and is now available on play
Edit2: Working on a patch for issue reported on note 3 and sony xperia Z, will hopefully have an update soon
Edit 3: New version in Play store with reported bugs fixed!
New in this release:
- Sign up from the app
- Performance improvements
- Display your online key in the app
Feature Highlights
- Complete control of your funds.
- 2 of 3 Multi-Signature accounts

It would be a good feature, I've always run under the assumption that if a user recovers their funds then they are effectively terminating the account. But his would be a really good sanity check to have in place. I need to think about the overhead of scanning for the outputs being spent, will do some research.

We use a centralized node, so yes, if that node is down you won't be able to broadcast. There is no 100% solution to his from mobile really, but you could use an SPV wallet like breadwallet which functions as a node on the Bitcoin network. This will have no dependence on a central server.
You don't have to enter 2fa every time on Ninki from your mobile. We use a device token that allows the bypass of two factor authentication. If you have GA on the same device as your wallet , it isn't two factor authentication anyway.
You will need to enter 2 factor authentication on the desktop chrome app to raise your account limits, send over your account limits, move your 2fa to another device, pair another phone app.
@_date: 2015-03-24 22:34:24
Hi, it looks like the phone was unpaired either due to entering the incorrect PIN too many times or clicking "unpair device" and then "ok"
Plus a lost 2 factor authenticator
Have pointed him to the recovery tool.
@_date: 2015-03-18 15:07:02
They are just the default limits when creating an account fron the phone.
The limits are controlled and configurable by you when you download the chrome app and setup 2fa (if you didn't already)
It means you can limit the amount that can be spent from your phone and in the chrome app limit the amount that can be spent without requiring two factor authentication.
Once you have the chrome app you are able to remotely invalidate the device, should you lose it. And should anyone steal your phone and guess your PIN number (within 3 attempts) they would be restricted to what they could take by the transfer limits you have set.
@_date: 2015-03-18 09:42:34

@_date: 2015-03-21 10:31:12
Google Authenticator (GA) and other time based OTP apps are supposed to  be cheap like-for-like emulators of hardware token devices such as Safeword Cards, Yubi keys, Gemalto cards
The idea is when you are accessing a website or piece of software on your desktop, instead of having a separate hardware device for every site you visit, you use GA on your phone.
With Genuine 2fa even if someone jumps on my PC at home they need to "know" my password and "have" my hardware token generator (GA). If they only know my password they can't authorize.
Unfortunately what has happened as mobile sites and apps gained in popularity is that people end up with GA on the same device as the app they are logging into which defeats many of the original points of 2fa.
In this case you might as well just have a device token, as it is similar to the functionality provided by features  such as "don't ask me for 2fa on this device (for x amount of time)"  which is currently available on Google, Cloudflare etc.
In these cases a cookie token is left on the device, which says to the server, "no need to ask for the 2factor code", the server checks to make sure it hasn't expired and then authorizes.
In GA you can see the explanation of this if you click settings and "how it works", note the icons are desktop and phone.
You also shouldn't be able to reveal or access the 2fa secret after the initial setup, moving GA to a new device should require a re-pairing with a new secret.

The validation phrase allows you to add contacts to your network and then send funds to them with a simple tap and click. You can either scan each others QR codes in the network-&gt;add contact area, or you can 'add contact' from the chrome app and afterwards validate each other using your validation phrases.
I wrote a post here about this and the dangers of address exchange and how using Ninki together with the validation phrases can solve this.

Ninki is a side project at the moment with just two of us working part time. I do all the coding and u/ninkidan works on strategy and funds the various costs involved.
We are based in Tokyo, Japan and have registered a company here (Green Densho Godo Kaisha) in case the project develops into something bigger.
Ideally I would quit my day job and work on this full time, so hopefully if there is a lot of demand this will become a reality.

The addresses can all be verified by the signing oracle, with the countersigning key dependent on a 2fa code at the point of broadcast ( not  just establishing a session)
Equally, malware on a rooted phone can replace addresses before the transactions are signed, and if no oracle to verify, the transaction will be broadcast.

I am still researching that particular one, the app itself runs in Nitro/v8 which handles memory management  so memory clearance should be handled as soon as data moves out of scope. And setting it to null etc. actually doesn't make any difference in terms of memory allocations i.e. You are always at the mercy of the garbage collector. 
I am still researching this to make sure I am correct on this though.

The initial exchange uses PGP and an out of band validation, which can be done with a QR code scan using the phone apps or a phrase exchange using the Chrome App. This is a one time thing and any attacker would have to compromise our server AND man in the middle the exchange simultaneously to compromise it.
Edit: So to clarify it isn't the same problem as before as potentially hundreds of insecure exchanges are replaced with a single very secure exchange and out of band verification.

Thanks for the review, really appreciate it, incidentally if you are interested in doing a more comprehensive review please drop me a message.
1. The backups are order dependent, correct.
2. I'll take a look at bip45- looks like it wasn't finalized when we implemented this. (Started design in feb 2014 so there are probably a few standards we have missed)
3. Base58 encoding there is probably no need for this.
4. That part is me deriving an address for a friend using a xpub triple that they sent to me. So I think it is doing what you expect.
5. Clearing of the data, I'll have a look at this.
6. There is only a single source, I am considering allowing key creation on separate devices as a future feature, (another option could be to source additional entropy from the server although at the same time I don't like to complicate this area of the code)
Edit: spelling extra info

It will do one day! At the moment lots of wallets have different standards and so normally have their own recovery tool. 
If Ninki disappeared you would go to github, run the tool, enter your backup seeds, it will scan he blockchain for your funds, then sign them over to any address you specify. But you would need to use the specific Ninki tool at the moment.

the general to do list is:

- translations, as you mentioned, there is some work to be done on this, but we will come up with a string table that can be used to provide translations. What language(s) can you do?
- we have a ton of other features to roll out over the next year, but i don't like announcing them until they are ready as i hate vaporware!

Ah, because you are exchanging encrypted packets 
1. You encrypt a node on your HD chain with his PGP public key
2. He accepts this and saves it and at the same time encrypts a node on his HD chain with your PGP public key and stores it on the server
3. You accept this and save it.
Then you need to validate the PGP fingerprints out of band using the validation phrases

It is not an SPV wallet, blockchain data comes from a full node which runs on our server. I am not a professional cryptographer and if I was I doubt I'd be building Bitcoin wallets :)
Obviously I haven't written any crypto myself for this project and use only proven libraries, researching and following the implementation guidelines. I also took a course in cryptography prior to developing the wallet.
I would love to have the wallet audited by a cryptographer, we are currently funding a project on Mike Hearn's lighthouse platform that is to be used for security bounties for Ninki, this is one thing we will try and do when we have the funds.

Thanks a lot, I really appreciate it!

Ninki Wallet for desktop, android and soon iOS :)
@_date: 2015-03-08 11:18:22
iOS is all ready, just waiting for Apple :|
Good point with the QR code, I'll look at doing that.

By accepting his request you will pull down the data required to generate addresses for him in the future. This will be encrypted on the client and stored on our server. This has to happen on both ends so it is a 3 step process (5 including validation at both ends)
The phone apps make this easier as it can be done in 2 steps with a mutual we code scan.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:09:34
Hi, the apps will be released later this month, I am in the process of finalizing them and getting them into the app stores
@_date: 2015-02-08 14:54:08
Long term the idea is to build software services on top of the basic wallet ( which will always be free) such as invoicing for small businesses , escrow services etc. and eventually charge for them in the same way github is free to use but if you want private repositories you pay x/ month and there are special business and corporate deals etc.
Right now and probably for the next year we are focusing on getting the basics done well. But yeah, the business model will be software as a service. With free and paid tiers. This seems a long way off though and also depends on the direction Bitcoin goes in in terms of userbase etc.

The network is part of the wallet, you can build your own payment network using PGP to exchange nodes in the HD Wallet key space. This allows you to make payments to anyone on your network without having to exchange addresses. (with zero address reuse)
@_date: 2015-02-09 10:25:40
It is similar to GreenAddress in that it is HD and multisig, our networking feature is really what sets us apart.
We are looking at the various hardware solutions and may integrate later this year.
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:18:05
Cool, thanks
- The user can recover funds anytime as we are 2 of 3 multisig , there is a tool to do this on github 
- I am looking into SPV (the attack you mentioned would only allow manipulation of change amounts which are throttled by Bitcoin core anyway , but yes it is a potential attack )
- We have a testnet environment at testnet.ninkip2p.com and our client is open source so can be built to point to the testnet env
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:51:38
yes, have added it to the list, thanks 
@_date: 2015-02-20 13:38:15
Our Github is here:
@_date: 2015-02-22 05:47:37
Yes, I think this is something we will have to implement eventually, I will add it to the list.
@_date: 2015-02-20 12:39:23
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:51:55
yeah, its just an informational website, you download the actual wallet from the chrome store
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:48:56
Will do this for next release, I realize we need to get instructions / explanations on everything. Thanks for all the feedback, sometimes it's difficult to see the wood for the trees when developing.

Well, you can now add friends via QR code scanning directly , so if you are in-person it is pretty seamless. If you have used Threema it is similar to that. 
You can also add using the mobile app in the same way you do on the chrome app, which is somewhat easier as you have the app right there as opposed to logging in.
For a later version of the mobile app I am planning to implement a vContact type exchange via the mobile apps too which will make things easier to remotely add people via the apps.
You can, of course, use Ninki like any other wallet and just send addresses manually to each other whenever you want to send , although this has less security than using the network.
@_date: 2015-03-01 12:16:57
Thanks. If you have an android phone you can download it here and pair with the Chrome App. Your transfer/velocity limits will apply to your phone.
iPhone version is pending approval from Apple
@_date: 2015-03-22 01:36:49
If it isn't loading it means some kind of incompatibility , what device model are you running it on?
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:33:24
I suppose step 3 could happen automatically on the client, let me give it some thought
@_date: 2015-02-20 12:09:49
It is a 2 of 3 multisig whereby the user holds 2 keys and Ninki hold one key. The user holds one key offline in order to recover the funds in the event our service is offline or we are forced to shut it down. 
The user holds the other key online on their device (encrypted) . 
We hold our key on the server and sign off on every transaction after validating the transaction in terms of preset amount and velocity limits (configurable by the user) and validating that the addresses on the transaction are valid and have not been replaced by malware on the users device.
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:11:44
No it doesn't but it is something we could probably implement assuming we can actually access the fingerprint data (I would assume as a hash) 
Edit: Actually no need for this as could store the pin encrypted using apples hardware and authorize retrieval using touch id...don't see any reason we can't add this, seems pretty straightforward
One attack vector with Touch ID is falling asleep next to your phone at a party and someone robbing you , or a member of your family clearing you out while you are sleeping.
Ninki has account transfer limits that can be preset so perhaps this won't be such a big deal.
@_date: 2015-02-08 14:25:32
will add, thanks for all this, valuable feedback...
@_date: 2015-03-04 01:10:50
Thanks! We do plan to introduce messaging although I'm not sure we will go full blown chat app, we already have invoices which are end to end encrypted so the ability to send messages will be quite an easy thing to implement.
I haven't decided quite how to approach it yet, maybe they will be more like notes (like a private encrypted post) with some interesting possibilities such as IOUs etc. or comments on payments etc.
Could go full on chat-app with inline Bitcoin sending etc. but I suspect building a fully functional chat client is a lot more work than it first appears.
@_date: 2015-03-04 09:30:21
Interesting, I'll look into it, thanks for the advice and the tip!
@_date: 2015-02-20 21:57:19
It is 2 of 3  HD multisig wallet so there are no import functions , you can see/write down/backup your hot key seed and restore it to a Ninki instance at a later date. And you write down your cold key seed when the account it created.
Exporting / importing private keys is not a practice I would encourage anyway as it makes sense to send all your funds to a new address and pay a small miners fee for the added security rather than risk a mistake exposing your keys.
@_date: 2015-02-08 12:31:29
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:27:43
I am waiting for Apple to approve it , any day now- so only in the Android store at he moment :|
@_date: 2015-02-20 11:39:52
When you "friend" someone on Ninki (either by adding them from the chrome app, or doing an in-person QR code scan on your phones) what actually takes place is an exchange of nodes on your HD chain. For example, I might hand off my xpublic key from node m/0/1001 to you and you might hand off your xpublic keys from node m/0/1006 to me.
Now the big question is how do we do this exchange without being subject to a MIM attack. In order to do this we use PGP to facilitate the exchange, with an out of band validation of the PGP fingerprint. This is done using a "Validation phrase" when using the Chrome App, and instantly and seamlessly  using the QR code scanners when on the mobile apps.
What this means is that when I want to send you funds, I use the xpublic keys you gave to me to derive a new address for you. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 14:16:39
thanks for the feedback also! 1 slice

There is an open source tool to recover your funds in the case of a disaster. As the wallet is multi-signature, you will need your 2 private seeds for the keys that you hold, and the master public key for the key that we hold. Using these three items you can sweep the address space and recover your funds into an address of your choice.
The tool is here:

Ah, I think Ninki Dan has confused things here, he was offering to demo how you would friend someone on Ninki, i.e. another person you know or a business you deal with.
So if you imagine Ninki Dan is someone you know or do business with regularly , they would now be on your network and you can send funds to them without needing to ask them for an address. If you send Ninki Dan your validation code he will be able to do the same to you.
