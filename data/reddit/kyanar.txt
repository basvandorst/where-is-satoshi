Brisbane Airport uses the services of [Travelbybit]( to accept payments, as do most retailers in Fortitude Valley (Brisbane’s nightlife district). Pretty much the only places that won’t take it are McDonald’s, 7-11 and Domino’s.

Because they’re legally required to is why. It’s absolutely necessary, dumb though it may seem.

No, the founder who’s currently in jail gets any profit.

Actually you won’t get “and then some”. Anything left over after giving you the money your BTC was worth when MtGox collapsed and any other creditors they owed money to will be given to the guy who founded the company (you know, the one in jail?) because that’s how Japanese bankruptcy law works.

No he wont. He’s acting in accordance with the law. The law in this case sucks, but that’s irrelevant.

No, it wouldn’t have. Certificates require the private keys of the CA to create, and their web facing servers do not have those keys. Even if you faked the CA’s website to point to servers under your control, you still couldn’t create a fake certificate as even if you made a fake CA, the client operating system wouldn’t have your public key preloaded so would reject it.
The only viable attack where HSTS and/or SSL pinning is not in use is to convince a CA with poor practices to issue you a cert - many Symantec CAs used to do this until the great untrusting.
