Wishing I had more money to buy with : /

IMO I would suggest doing increments of 5 btc at a time. Send 5 to GDAX, Sell 5, wire 5, once your wire comes in do the next batch. Better to have a hiccup on 10% of what you were going to do and deal with that versus dealing with a $500k issue 
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:51:41
First off, don’t worry too much. You’re not going to jail or anything extreme (I’ve been in your position before where I forgot to state some gains from stock transactions from a few years prior and I didn’t go to jail lol). I’d suggest you go to a CPA versus HR to do an amendment and they will calculate all that for you. It’s better for you to be proactive then have the irs come knocking. But don’t worry, pay your interest and move on

At this clip they won’t be able to open trading. They need to either scrape the bch exchange idea and let everyone just move their bch elsewhere to sell or risk having bch crash.  Armstrong’s a coward and will write up some post about how they won’t open the exchange until the new year or some shit.

Google it, the most they allocate combined on digital assets is $700mil. I doubt they are going to go balls deep to short. I’m sure they will short but why destroy your whole fund on 1 position? After all it’s a crypto hedge fund. Defeats the purpose of a fund that damages all of their holdings with 1 bet.

Now this answer I can respect because you are absolutely correct (terminology wise you’re wrong Majority of hedge funds are classified as institutional because they control investments on behalf of others). But whales doing this exact scenario I can see.

Correct me if I’m wrong but institutional investors are not allowed to buy bitcoin right now and the only way for them to enter the btc market is with the futures market. Therefore this hoopla about these investors selling off etc makes no sense...

Ask your aunt the following:
1. “Where” on her computer is the bitcoin
2. If she does not know- then consider them gone
3. When she got the bitcoin, how did she get them? I know you said from a friend, but how did her friend give it to her? 
4. Her friend could have sent it to a wallet (place online where the bitcoins are stores or a physical device that is storing the bitcoin). 
If none of this makes sense and she really has over $200k in bitcoin, it would do you good to start researching about bitcoin and the steps taken to purchase it.  This way you’re familiar with the terms and can start deciphering and figuring out where the bitcoin can be.
Bitcoin is more complex then a bank account so it’s not as easy for us to tell you exactly where it can be or to call this number.
Once you find it, send a small test batch to Coinbase (open an account first obviously) if the small test batch arrives then your aunt has a nice little pay day :) from there she sells or holds or a mixture of both. If you ask any of us we’d tell you to hold :) 
I hope you find it and I hope she throws down a couple coins your way for helping!

Are you naive to think institutional money would gamble with being able to run a marketing campaign to spread fud in hopes of making their bets win? Institutional money invest with an edge and not being able to control or trade the actual asset is far from an acceptable edge.

We all run with different crowds so ymmv.  Many of the people I run across on a daily basis or have run across in the past few months (kids teachers, coaches, barber, bank tellers, car salesman, random people at holiday parties) btc always comes up and everyone has an opinion but I always ask if they are invested and only one person has said they have and that person loved the prospects of the future.  The others were concerned about this or that or not knowing how to or really wanted to get into it for a quick gain... but that’s just my experience 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:11:37
My cpa (I’m in Cali) told me to just report cost basis even if the exchange doesn’t give me anything.  He said if there are no exact figures because i don’t remember then to use average of that day, week, month and that should show good faith effort on my part

Google paper wallet, you can print out a cool paper wallet with qr code and simple instructions guiding them on how to use/sell it. I’m on mobile so I can’t get the link but it’s one of the first results when you google it.  I’m doing the same for my nieces and nephews.

There’s a difference between being aware of btc and actually participating. From my experience most of the people I know, know about btc but very few have actually purchased it... 
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:08:35
Another thing to note that I saw on here was that transferring to a hard wallet is not considered a taxable event. I was worried because I always move everything to the Ledger and that would suck if I had to pay tax to store it!

Imo we are just days away from Xmas. I’ve been day trading stocks for several years and around this time volume dries up because lots of people are on vacation or have other things to do.  No buyers- prices take a hit. One interesting thing is that people will gather with family/friends for the holiday and there should be a bit of buying by newcomers.  Those who wish they got in cheaper- well wish granted, go buy.  It’s easy to say you’ll buy when price drops, it’s another thing to actually do it :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:24:14
Welcome! Look at the daily chart of btc on tradingview.com (it’s free). If you look at every point where a new high was made, price goes back down to a support area and then might consolidate for a bit before creeping back up. Apply same principle on hourly chart. A slight correction is healthy and needed for this to continue up. We don’t know the future but we know the past. Let the past guide the way when you get antsy :)

For sure. I’ve been audited once (not for bitcoin) and it’s a lot of fun... what I gleaned from that experience is that once you’re in audit the irs wants to get something so they don’t look like an ass and they will figuratively flip all your shit upside down to find something.  At the end of mine they had to give me an additional deduction that we missed lol

Altcoins- other crypto currencies like ripple, dash- those alt coins are not traded at GDAX/coinbase so you need to do those trades at a different exchange.  Like Bittrex and Binance.

Coinbase won’t open this up until there’s more liquidity. That Sell Wall needs to shrink or they won’t open because it’s going to crash. Look at that shit! 5000 against maybe a total of 1000.  Best thing to do is cancel your order until it opens and then slam it. Once it opens and blood is on the floor they will need to either halt trading again and look like ass holes or let the market do what it wants.  Fuck coin base.

One thing I will point out is that institutional investors are not allowed to trade actual bitcoin. So a retail investor could do this, but not institutional traders.  As part of their charter they cannot make trades in unregulated markets (btc) thus the creation of the futures market as a entry into btc.  Even the etfs that might come online are not holding actual btc.  So it’s a moot point and that’s why this fear of shorting my institutional market was all fud to start with.  But no one wants to go down to basics and get that institutional investors were never in bitcoin at our exchanges (GDAX, Gemini etc). Whales on the other hand could do this so you still have a point.  Also worth noting is you’re maxed at 5 contracts (5 bitcoins) per investor... so unless you have a lot of rich buddies you can’t coordinate and “attack”.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:16:46
I just bought some right now just to test and transaction went through with no problem.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:57:20
Use this format so you can day dream with all sorts of numbers: future price / purchased price. Multiple that number by the $ about you bought.
Example: future price is $100,000 and purchase price was $20,000 (100,000/20,000= 5) multiple 5 by how much you put in ($50). $50x5 = $250.
Your $50 is worth $250 when price hits $100k
Ignore the punks who say this is 1st grade math or whatever. Depending on your line of work maybe you never need to use math and forgot how to do this. Forgetting is human and shouldn’t be mocked

I agree 100% with what you wrote. I’m in the same mind set as you, let it be. I went in with two exit options, sell at x price or it all goes to zero.  So let whichever happen.  Obviously I want to reach the “moon” but if it goes to zero then it has been one hell of a fun ride.  I don’t think it will, but anytime it starts getting doom and gloom around here I’m at peace. I personally think we will stop the bleeding at $8000, looking at the daily chart it looks like $8000 needs to be tested and a nice base there for us to get going again.  Anyhow, nice post :)
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:59:54
For BTC GDAX is reliable (sure they have outages etc but which exchange doesn’t?) and their customer service is nonexistent.  7btc is a lot to trade with. I’m not your dad so I’m not going to lecture you on the negatives of setting forth in what you’re doing.  Just make sure you’re not only looking through rose colored lens and you realize that it’s entirely possible to lose a shit ton on 1 bad trade. Good luck 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:45:21
Same, fuck coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:39:32
You only need the record if you get audited. They won’t ask you to send transaction receipts/statements. Since we are reporting 2017 just go over all transactions in 2017 and see how many btc you used and calculate what the cost basis was when you purchased those versus when you “sold”. Make sure you take into account the tix fee cause that’s all deductible. Like your $5 coffee might end up being a profit of $3 but since it cost $3 tix fee it’s a wash technically.  Don’t stress too much about 2017. IRS wants to go after those who dodged, not spend audit $ on those who actually reported. My cpa said that them going after coinbase is a shot across the bow to get crypto investors to start reporting for 2017 and he doubts they will go after 2009, 2010, 2011 etc tax years. So for 2018 just keep better record.  I’m using blockfolio to enter my cost basis and anytime I buy another altcoin I enter it there and figure out on excel my profit so that at the end of the year I can print that and give to the cpa.  Hope that helps. But once again just give it a good faith effort and you should be fine.

Coinbase is the largest, so there you go. Also, the difference in your example in switching euro to usd is that there is no profit... so why would you pay tax when it’s basically even?  Now if you trade forex and do eur/usd you do pay taxes.  So btc/usd, you rightfully have to pay taxes as well.  I’m going to be hodling until we hit a certain price I have in mind and maybe at that point I won’t need to convert to usd... if I do then I’d gladly pay Uncle Sam his 15%. Also, moving your btc to a hard wallet doesn’t constitute a tax payment, it’s only when you sell for fiat that the govt wants their share.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:44:21
Are you trying to daytrade btc or other alt coins?  If you’re doing just btc then GDAX is fine.  Not sure why you’d keep 7 coins at an exchange but just know that it’s risky regardless which exchange it’s at to have that much exposed.  As far as w/d you will have daily limits, I was able to get Coinbase/GDAX to increase my w/d limit with ease.  Good luck

I’m sure with the records handed over to the irs they can differentiate a withdrawal to a bank versus another wallet/exchange address.  If not you can prove it in an audit (not fun but at least you can back it up)
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:00:36
You realize profits by converting your btc to cash. The profit you make will be taxed like property (USA) if it’s short term then you’d pay % based on what bracket you’re in. If you held for longer then 365 days then it’s long term cap. Gains which is like 15-20% I believe.  Unless you know how to swing trade/day trade I don’t think short term investing in btc will be lucrative... it’s all speculation on the short term so it’s really heads or tails at that point. Long term on the other hand... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:47:21
IMHO I think btc will be the entry way into other altcoins that can transact faster. Not saying go buy altcoins but btc will be the gold standard and alts will be the “paper money”.  Everything I invest in btc I go in kissing it good bye. It’s easier to put in the money and let it ride versus stressing about “what if this is a bubble?” I have a sell price in mind and if it hits it great, if not then oh well.  I’m hoping at that price I won’t be selling it but rather spending it on mortgage payments, tuition, etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:37:26
I use the Ledger s Nano (hard wallet- as in it’s a physical devise that “holds” my coin). If you buy one make sure you buy direct and not from eBay (Amazon is fine if you buy from a retailer that’s authorized). To transfer you will be sending the bitcoin to the address of your wallet. If you’re new to all this make sure you send a small test batch to make sure you got everything correct and are comfortable with it.  Last thing you want to do is fuck it and send it to nowhere and it’s lost forever.
The other route is a paper wallet- if you are prone to losing paper or fear it will get misplaced then don’t go this route.
Good luck on the ride up :) make sure you don’t let days like today freak you out! Just hang tight and you’ll get to the top!

I’d say use the 10btc to put towards a down payment on a income property.  Calculate about 50% for mortgage and expenses related to up keep and vacancy etc.  the other 50% save up to use towards down payment on your Tesla and have the rental property pay your Tesla.  Long term you get what you want plus you now have income long after a car dies off.  But yes, sell 1 btc and treat your self for a job well done :). I like the idea of putting $100k in dividend earning equities (make sure you reinvest the dividend).  Maybe even play around with buying another investment income or two? Lastly, already pick price points where you’ll sell another x btc and hodl the rest for x time frame.  You’re in a great spot bud!

Crypto isn’t property so you can’t do a 1031 exchange (which is what you’re talking about).  For sure talk to a cpa so you don’t have to take a internet strangers advice etc.
