That client was around 40. Most of my customers are over 30. Less then 10% under 30. The one who was thinking of buying some is in his late 60's.

Thanks. lol 
Im not stressed or upset or even discouraged. Just was a reality check on how much of a fringe it still is. I spent $4 on the stickers and spent 3 min. putting them on my van. Other then that I have done nothing else. Im not thinking of giving up as I put them on considering it would just be like a bonus if someone did pay with it.

I was a silver bug before bitcoin and am amazed at those I know that are into PM's,but won't touch bitcoin. We would talk about all the sheeple that know nothing of PM's, then when I get into bitcoin they act the same towards bitcoin as the sheeple to PM's.

I just got a new van and need to buy some stickers for it. Might as well do it now.

Right on. Once you have it in hand the bug begins to grow. Especially when you get a Perth coin.

The Denver technological Center (DTC) is located in south Denver. It should  be skewed more in my favor. I happen to be a terrible ambassador for bitcoin though, as I can't explain it very well.

Will do. Thanks

Your right although What really surprised me wasn't that no one wanted to pay with bitcoin, but I haven't met anyone that owned bitcoin. At the gas station or restaurants or grocery store, driving down the road...
