What is your point? That there is more fragmentation on ethereum? Or that more repos are better?

Got into btc ~1850ish. Finally decided to read up about it after hearing about it  through some co workers (tech related). Loved the idea and bought in.

Hey get to work OP github.com/bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:38:23
Clearly no idea what he was talking about. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:51:22

He’s clearly just trying to downplay the technology because he doesn’t understand. Greed or complacency has him at a point where he doesn’t want to see change. 
We need to figure out a way to better communicate to people like him the magic of transacting with bitcoin and why it makes sense today. He’s not allowing the possibility cross his mind. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:36:06
No. You can not predict this.

I like it. Portfolio feature is simple and it has a lot of coins. Nice looking widget and also watch widget. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:25:05
Yeah I think that was my sisters grandmas moms too. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:35:45
I thought it was pretty awesome they didn’t tie any angle of hacker or drug dealers into the equation. A great wholesome look at what it is with a comedic twist. It’s a win. Those reruns will run forever. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:27:04
Thanks! Amazing reads. Need to check out antbleed. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:02:18
Well yes because no or low fees on transactions VS. Higher fees on coinbase. Kicker is you need to have fiat USD or EUR in the account (coinbase or other). Transfers take 4 days. If you are a user of coinbase you can instant transfer with credit/debit

My bet is China wakes with major FOMO and wants in before the fork to get both coins. Pushes it higher. No idea of course but HODL.

I’m pretty sure something extremely catastrophic would have to happen to dip 75%

GDAX is an exchange by coinbase. If you have a coinbase account you have a GDAX account. Use GDAX to buy and sell. GDAX.com

So basically until 5am EST to buy tons. Seems like China could wake up to charge in.

To clarify I only suggested smaller buy ins in order to ease OPs worry about entering the market. OP don’t take my advice as “bulletproof”. There is no right or wrong answer do what you are comfortable with. Research.

They more than anyone love moving big money. If they start seeing how easy and secure it is to move why wouldn’t they fall in love with BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:31:33
Just cost average by putting 250 in a week until you’re comfortable. That way you’ll get the dips. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:54:12
Hey man I really like this team but if they lose I ain’t on that team. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:23:20
Do you care if you lose the 1000$?
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:50:14
HODL 
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:52:17
Hey if he can unlock them pull 3 mil out and leave the other 44m In there. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:27:07
Well then I would think harder about what you need that 1k for. Otherwise? If it’s not a big deal then invest. Bitcoin is fun and can be volatile so just HODL and don’t sell when and if it does dip and you will be in for the long haul. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:46:00
I guess I take that back. It is impressive to be a major contributor to a financial crisis for millions of people and just  get to pay a couple billion and wipe your slate clean. I mean they would never do anything like that again right? 
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:19:17
Nothing about chase bank is impressive.
