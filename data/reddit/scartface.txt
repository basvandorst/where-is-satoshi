Thanks for the reply! So I assume that we still need to backup custom scripts that cannot be derived in a deterministic way.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:55:17
No, but by changing the nonce they are getting a completely different block hash, and they are looking for a block hash smaller than a certain target (also known as difficulty).
However, the nonce field is not the only field miners use to change the block hash.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:57:48
Since I got downvoted I just want to clarify that I think MAST seems like a great feature. I was just thinking about how redeem scripts are managed right now and if loss of redeem scripts will be a problem in the future.
I decided to ask the question in a new post: 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:16:09
That's a pretty good solution! Do you know if there is any existing system or service that handles this?
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:44:31
Yes, the SPV client only needs to download the block header which contains the merkle root. And using the merkle root, the SPV client can verify that a certain transaction was included in that block.
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:47:46
Almost, the nonce is included in the block header (and thus changing its hash).
    SHA256(blockheader) &lt; difficulty
    SHA256(blockheader) == 000000000000000000297ae30ca8b102fab65ed864ec292f2c25f36117e97e47
`000000000000000000297ae30ca8b102fab65ed864ec292f2c25f36117e97e47` is just a hex-formatted number and needs to be lower than 2,603,077,300,218.59 (in your example) to be a valid solution to the proof-of-work algorithm.
And since the nonce is inside the block header, changing it will return a completely different hash. That makes it impossible to calculate the nonce value and the only solution is to randomly try different values until you find a hash (number) lower than the target.
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:52:02
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:11:43
No, unfortunately they are not. I started this project one year ago, before SegWit was activated. However, Bitcore (which I'm using as node and bitcoin library) announced that they would add support for SegWit. But that never happened.
I'm thinking about adding SegWit support myself, but I'm not sure if it's worth the work for this particular app. P2SH-wrapped SegWit addresses would probably be easier though.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:57:17
I see, thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:06:23
Exactly, but now a days miners also change other things to get a new block hash because the nonce field is not big enough to get enough tries.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:18:09
Why all the downvotes? It was just a joke about Bitcoin Cash "catching" people failing to understand blockchain technology.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:16:31
That's a pretty good solution! Do you know if there is any existing system or service that handles this?
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:20:40
If you're a developer you could query and work with the blockchain directly instead of using 3rd-party APIs. That's what I'm using my full node for :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:50:31
I'm using the CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode using P2SH addresses, so there's no way of unlocking the coins before the specified date. So be responsible :)
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:29:00
That would be ideal, but it wouldn't be able to derive other participants' public keys in a multisig address. Losing the redeem script would mean having to collect them again, as well as collecting the right public keys and assembling them in the exact same order and configuration.
I believe that a good script management/storage system of some kind will be very important in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:05:45
Yes it is.
If you use the same mnemonic seed in another wallet, e.g. Breadwallet, it wouldn't be able to detect the locked funds (UTXOs). And also vice versa - BitHodl wouldn't be able to find unlocked funds transferred by the other wallet. But you could still use the same seed in both wallets without them interfering with each other.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:02:12
No, sorry :/ But it's made with React Native so shouldn't be too hard to make it work on Android too. But it's not planned at the moment.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:11:53


Although Alice doesn't need to know Bob's and Carol's scripts, she would still have to know their merkle hashes in order to provide a valid merkle path. So she would still know that there are more ways to spend the output.
And if Alice somehow lost the merkle path (or her own redeem script), she wouldn't be able to spend the output. I wonder how many funds might be lost in the future due to losing the actual redeem scripts?
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:37:54
Haha nah, he's the person ready to catch you if you fail. Or is that bcash? ��

Yes, it's actually more or less done. I'm currently setting up Travis, writing unit tests and other things to wrap it up.
You can actually find it on github already:
So hopefully I can release it on the App Store soon. Interested in giving it a try before?
I'm very eager to move on to more important and interesting projects and I have a lot of ideas that I want to explore!

The nonce field is used by miners to change the hash when mining. It's basically just a random number.
1. Yes, pretty much
2. No, it was there before SegWit and used by e.g. SPV clients to verify that a certain transaction is in a block
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:19:58
Or just use [BitHodl]( - it's almost finished ;)
@_date: 2018-09-08 23:46:26
Thank you :)
Exactly how channels will be opened and closed is something I’m still working on.
But the principle is going to be similar to how Apple is doing with SMS and iMessages; If the person you're sending to has a lightning channel open, the transaction will be sent over the Lightning Network, otherwise it will fall back to a standard bitcoin transaction.
And if the other person has a channel open but you don't, then the app will ask you if you want to open a channel with that person. But if you're trying to send a regular bitcoin transaction and doesn't have enough funds in your wallet, the app will then ask you if it can close one or more channels to fund that transaction.
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:49:22

Hmm idk, but I will see myself out... ��
Edit: Since I'm getting downvoted, let me clarify:
* It's a free app that's open-source
* There's no ICO or any other way for me to make money on this app at this moment
* I did disclaim that I was the developer of the app
So no, it's not a shill ��
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:18:44
Cool! But why does "Hodl Crypto" and "Mine Bitcoin" look like signatures?

But these apps seems to be exactly what I've been looking for. Thanks again ��
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:57:54
Great overview, thanks! One thing I’m missing though is how they connect to the blockchain - via a third-party API or SPV?

I'm working on a bitcoin wallet that does exactly that, check it out:
@_date: 2017-02-04 12:35:15
I'm currently working on a wallet called [BitHodl]( which sole purpose is to lock your bitcoins for a certain time period.
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:00:54
Yes, it will. To lock some coins, a transaction to a P2SH (pay to script hash) have to be made. The script locks the coins until a certain date, and they can be spendable after that date.
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:30:43
I will definitely look into that, thanks!
@_date: 2017-01-11 14:43:20
That's also a pretty smart solution.
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:52:15
It's for people who want to ensure that they will hold their coins for a certain time without giving in to pressure when the prise increases or drops quickly.
The wallet will also show some charts on how the value has changed in EUR or USD.
And whether or not people want something like this - that's why I'm posting here to try to find out :)
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:21:51
I think your tweet is great, and totally agree with your reasoning. I just think that the title might be a slightly too optimistic interpretation of their reply. They didn't really say that they were thinking about accepting bitcoin.
But let's hope they will, though :)
@_date: 2017-01-11 15:50:55
Yes, that's correct.
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:21:56
I had trouble buying and only got responses that the request timed out or "Not found". All of the sudden the app had placed three orders instead of one. Hopefully it will be a good thing...
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:21:50
I’m working on a bitcoin wallet that will make it a lot easier to hodl (hold) your bitcoins for a certain time period. It will actually make it impossible not to hodl! It uses pay-to-script hashes to lock the coins to a specified date.
I’m posting here for feedback and to see if there is any potential interest in this wallet?
Thank you,
@_date: 2017-01-11 13:51:45
One solution would be to force the user to print a QR code and then scan it with the app before it's possible to proceed. Or something similar.
@_date: 2017-01-11 14:50:02
I'm very happy to hear that!
Adding the same functionality to bitaddress.org would be cool! Then they could use BitHodl to load the private key and spend their unlocked btc. It would be a nice solution for people who don't want to store their private key on their phone/computer.
Thank you, I love bitcoin and want to contribute in a creative way :)
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:53:12
Thanks, I will consider it :)
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:09:24
Haha yeah, but I think it's good as a start - it's fun, relevant, and "gets people going". And if the app gets popular, maybe a rename/rebrand is possible to convey another image.

I really like your idea about the self-contained device. Kind of like a Nano Ledger S with a screen that tells you how long time there's left until it's are spendable.
Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2017-01-11 13:01:36
The app will tell the user to keep a backup (the recovery phrase) in case they need to restore the wallet. So if the phone get lost, breaks, etc. they will not loose their funds.
And the same applies to e.g. a laptop. It can get dropped, stolen, reset too. A desktop would be more secure in that sense. But they're more vulnerable to viruses than an iPhone.
Besides, everyone I know doesn't even own a computer, and only has a phone.
However, if things works out I might do it for both platforms :)
@_date: 2016-11-10 13:11:30

I'm using ["Swedish rounding"]( i.e. 0.5 or above gets rounded up, and below 0.5 gets rounded down to a whole bitcoin. I will see how I can clarify that on the website.

Yes, that would be very cool! But also more technically challenging, as it would require me to either save the state of each block in time, or traverse the blockchain in real-time.
But who knows, if I have the time in the future I might give it a try.
@_date: 2016-11-10 18:31:30

I've done the same mistake.
I use [Coinbase]( now instead. The [fees are 1.49%]( for both selling and buying.
It's very easy to do a SEPA transfer and then you can buy and sell bitcoins instantly.

Thanks a lot!
The HTML is just HTML without any CSS framework (such as bootstrap). And then I'm using JavaScript to load the data from the server and render the graphs. I wanted to try out [Vue]( so I'm using it to display the numbers on the page. I'm also using some jQuery for some events and making ajax requests.
The data is just static files which I generate every time a new block is created. To generate the data, I've modified the Bitcoin Core and have a Node.js process fetching and saving the data.
The actual images/blockchains are rendered with HTML5 canvases.
I'm also using [browserify]( so I could use some npm packages.
You can check out the full source code from my GitHub:
  
Thanks again!
@_date: 2016-11-11 23:11:39
I liked the challenge of digging into the Bitcoin Core source code :) I also tried reading the LevelDB file myself but wasn't very successful...
May I ask what you're trying to do?
@_date: 2016-11-10 12:58:54
This is a website I created just for fun to visualize the distribution of the unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) in the blockchain.
Each pixel in the images represents one block. So the first pixel (counted left to right from the top) is the genesis/first block. If you hover over that pixel in the first image (orange), you'll see that it has a block height of 1, and 1 unspent transaction output in it. If you hover over the same pixel in the other image (blue), you will see that it has a combined value of 50 BTC.
So by looking at these two images, you can see how the UTXOs ("coins") are distributed over the whole blockchain. You can also see where most of the value is stored with the blue image.
Naturally, a lot of the "coins" and its value are concentrated at the end of the blockchain. But it's also possible to see that there's a lot of unspent coins in the blocks of early 2013. The same applies to the blocks in mid 2015.
Let me know if you have any questions :)
@_date: 2016-11-11 09:19:28
I've modified the Bitcoin Core a bit to fit my needs. It requires you to run a full node and consumes over 100GB in disk space.
You can see my changes here: 
Then I'm extracting the data with this script every time there's a new block:
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:23:57
AltaVista didn't have a whole ecosystem around it, and it was quite easy for the world to transition from AltaVista to Google.
But with bitcoin I think it's different. Bitcoin has a pretty large ecosystem with miners, wallets, exchanges, hardware, services, etc.
One way would be if many of the existing bitcoin services started supporting the new coin too (like some did with ETH).
@_date: 2016-11-25 01:05:11
Then I don't really see the problem. AltaVista was a company that "lost" to Google. But bitcoin is not a company, and if all bitcoin vendors can easily retool for another crypto currency that is better in some way, why would we fight to keep bitcoin just for the sake of it?
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:15:08
I'm interested in one too if you're going to make more of them :)
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:12:50

Each pixel represents a block, where each column is 300 blocks. The orange visualizes the number of unspent transaction outputs per block, and the blue visualizes the amount of unspent BTC per block.
How I made it:
1. Precalculated all block heights to snapshot the UTXO stats at (every 1008 blocks)
2. Downloaded the whole blockchain using the Bitcoin Core client
3. Wrote a script that invalidates all blocks to X using the Bitcoin Core’s RPC
4. Saved a snapshot of the UTXO set using the same method as for utxo-stats.com (see source code below)
5. Saved price with each snapshot (from a csv file downloaded from coindesk.com)
6. Repeated step 3 - 5 by invalidating the next 1008 blocks
7. Copied the source code for utxo-stats.com modified it to load these snapshots one by one
8. Recorded the screen using QuickTime
9. Imported the movie into iMovie and sped it up
Source code for utxo-stats.com:  
Modified version of the Bitcoin Core client:

Hopefully it's just like you're saying that they have been idle to wait and see how SegWit turned out.
It's a great and well-documented library so it would be sad to see it deteriorate. But by looking at the segwit branch, it looks like it might still be alive :)

That's funny, I'm actually working on a bitcoin wallet that will allow you to pay to people's Venmo with bitcoin, without having Venmo yourself ��

Hi, I'm the developer of the BitHodl app. I understand the concern and recommend to read and run the source code yourself.
It's made with React Native so you might get it to run on Android with some tweaks, but I've never tried that myself.
You could also just copy the lock and unlock functions from the app into a nodejs script and create lock addresses manually. Have a look at these files:
It's using the [Bitcore Library]( It's not a library I would recommend to use anymore, but it's what I used when I created the app.
Happy to answer any questions if you have any :)
