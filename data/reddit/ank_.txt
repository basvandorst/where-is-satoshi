Alright looks like this is the top for now.

I actually agree with this. If we have decided to go down this road then lets set a deadline. If Coinbase/miners can't comply with that, then they can't be in Bitcoin anymore. Current incentive structure is completely screwed.

So I have a question. Lets say LN is implemented and most transactions are on other chains. As I understand, that doesn't mean no one can use core blockchain, only that they don't need to. So whats then stopping these same scum of miners to spam the blockchain and increase their fees again ? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:16:08
If it was not Roger, It would be someone else spamming the network to pump of their shit. Issue is that we need to withstand these attacks. And I know that increasing blocksize won't solve anything as these attacks would still continue. Maybe we need a better short term fix. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:48:45
Alright that makes sense. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:23:22
Alright None of other Coins have this issue .. why are they dumping ?  BTrash which touts all the penny fees and 10 min transaction time is down 60% from top ? Its simple correction in whole crypto space. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:25:28
I am not talking about LN. As I understand LN works on core blockchain for settlement. You would still have an option to transact on core blockchain. Whats stopping a miner to spam core blockchain like they are doing now to increase their profits.

18 months is a timeframe I keep hearing. Problem is that no one is putting a date on it. And with a change this big a very slow rollout has to be expected. Segwit is Exhibit A. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:31:43
You are correct. Any node which doesn't support Blocksize will have to drop out. I think a better example would be to take lowest computing option like Raspberry Pi and see how much memory can they support. I am pretty sure its more than 1 MB.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:04:50
Ultimate solution has to be layered approach. People are delusional if they think that all their coffee and micro transactions can be done on one single blockchain. As I see, the current fight is horizontal scaling vs Vertical scaling. Think of a web server which is under heavy load. You can always increase the size of memory and processor count and it works. Problem is it only works till you reach the limit where it is no longer viable to increase that anymore. Then you need to increase server count. Currently a company like google has 1000's of parallel low end horizontal servers serving all search requests. That is how scaling works. Problem is that right now our server is not able to serve the load and we are not ready with a solution which can be deployed on multiple servers. So we need to increase server spec till we are ready with proper solution. 
Also another excellent example from Andreas :

I actually completely agree with you. I will even confess that current Core Devs are 100 times better than me and know better. My problem is that they are not even acknowledging that fees are an issue right now. From twitter, I seem to be getting opposite signals. This is an open source project , but its like none of other projects which we have seen till now. No other project has 300Bn market cap( Well not right now). No other project is deployed globally at this scale. Maybe Tor comes close but it doesn't have any similarity in architecture.

I know what it means. I was actually frustrated by every idiot that in my vicinity trying to invest in BTC without even studying it. These kinds of events are necessary for proper education. Plus some dark humor doesn't hurt anyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:56:01
Markets are irrational. All shitcoins and ICO's are pumping. Lets settle at 2$ :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:50:41
I know Segwit doubles the size if all parties comply. But the problem here is that we took a mis-step when our scaling solution had a dependency on all parties involved. Now we are in a situation where we are dependent on 2-3 companies, which are fighting for their own survival, which have their own scaling issues. Right now Coinbase doesn't really care about Bitcoin. It has its own investors and future plans to worry about. They are thinking in terms of a platform which can support multiple coins and onboard 200-300K users per day. I would be the happiest man right now if a company like Square would come today and say they support bitcoin with Segwit. Or even better if Coinbase would say they don't support Bitcoin anymore. Problem is that Coinbase is basically a parasite on Bitcoin right now. They are feeding off us and killing us too.

Pro's who actually want to sell don't list themselves on order books. They come in at last second, when there is demand and dump their stake. Most of these walls of Orders are generally there just to instill fear or confidence. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 08:24:31
Here's how I see it. Lets consider a simple concept of Supply and Demand. 
There will be two kind of buyers. 
1) People who were early adopters. Folks who bought when price was less than 100 $ and holding since. Selling by such folks will create a downward pressure for sure. But it also creates a positive hype in the market and more money flows through the bitcoin economy. 
2) People who are not early adopters will have to buy new bitcoins. Thus balancing the selling pressure.
The way I see, there is no way that we have more than 100-500k early adopters. If we go for mass adoption, then we are talking about a scale of atleast 100M+ users. So In short, there might be some selling pressure now, but it shouldn't be a major problem in future. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 17:32:37
Yup agreed on average price and highest price. My whole point is that 2M  USD per block is not a joke. So we won't see any crazy bids. It will all be in the range of -50 to +50 on average of 600. More than the price,I am actually interested in finding out who were the bidders and how much they bid. Hoping the Feds show their incompetence again . Ya but this is a brilliant case study in game theory.

Axis bank is a pretty big bank in India .. but I am guessing this is nothing more than an intern managing their twitter account. Businesses in India are generally very slow in catching up with new trends.

This goes for any investment. You have lost the game if you have emotional attachment with your investment. The moment you become greedy and put up money, the loss of which may cause emotional stress makes you a gambler. 
     If you invest any money, be prepared for it to go to zero or have clearly defined rules for exit no matter what the outlook is. I love Bitcoin, the technology and the community. But my only investment till now is 200$ and I am happy to lose it all. I never bought more bitcoins when the price was rising or dropping as that according to be would be gambling .. Just my 2 satoshis :)

I am not a whale .. but lets say if I were and wanted to buy at lower prices. First I would have accounts in all exchanges. Even with low volume these days, average daily volume per exchange is still 10k plus. I will not put a huge order in one exchange for 20k . Instead I would create a wall of something like 50-100 coins at price slightly lower than market and would wait for someone to take the bait. As soon as I bought 50 coins, my bot would again bid for 50 coins at slighly lower price. 
But realistically I will wait for the FUD filled days, and buy stakes when people are dumping them. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:09:48
Actually it would be a good idea to make a curated web resource for each country. Stuff like what exchanges are available, how reliable are they, how to do international wire transfer if required, whats the central bank stance, what stuff can it be spent on and what are possible risks etc. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:36:40
Here is my prediction .. It will be a  non event like everything else in last 6 months. Winning bids will be in range of 550 - 600.

A later question actually clearly reveals his psychology. He is asked about his thoughts on the falling Indian Rupee wrt USD. He says, as a central banker its not the level of USDINR that concerns me but the volatility of the move. Put that in context of Bitcoin and we know why they are cautious about it.

Bollywood basically refers to Hindi Films shot from "Bo"mbay production houses. Likewise every major region has their own movie industry in their language. so Bollywood represents 1 of 8-9 major movie industries coming out of India.
