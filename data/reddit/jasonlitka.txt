...and I'm still shocked that someone managed to setup a working site on EC2 without knowing something as basic as the meaning of "Ephemeral"...  It's not exactly a user-friendly service.

Then you typed something incorrectly.

How about this one?  Brand new, just launched a couple days ago, has a focus on PCI-compliance, MIGHT be more secure, MIGHT be a bigger target...
@_date: 2011-07-31 22:34:29
Then you don't know how to use it.  I've no issues with EC2, never lost data, and never had unexpected downtime.

You have to do the same thing when setting up a PayPal account.  The only difference there is that now PayPal allows you to back an account with a CC.  They didn't always have that option.

I'm not one of those people that believes we're in a gold bubble and that it's about to pop, dropping prices to 25-50% of their current, but I do believe that the recent 60-90 day plateau in pricing is the end of the rapid growth the past decade has seen.
I think we're going to see 3-5 year bond-level growth over the next 10 years, and considering the remote possibility of a crash in pricing (there have been a TON of people buying gold over the past 6 months, at some point they're going to sell, and the price will drop), plus the capital gains issues on selling bullion, and the bonds are safer and a better bet.  Gold is supposed to stabilize a portfolio, not drive it at high risk, and I don't believe it serves that purpose at this point (which is why I've been selling off my gold and silver).

Reddit is extremely dependent on EBS volumes which don't have the best track record for reliability.  If you design your architecture with the assumptions that EC2 instances and/or EBS volumes will fail on a regular basis then you won't have an issue.
Anyway, comparing Reddit with this idiot is a mistake.  They may not have the greatest uptime, but they don't lose data.

I think it is.  The article is aimed at people who are new.  Those people want a simple chart that tells them what is best out of the box, not which card is more overclockable, that changing the work size makes a given card more efficient, or that downloading a custom kernel will get you an extra 2%.

Yeah, that's what I was getting at though.  The words "ephemeral", "not persistent", etc. are all over the docs.  If the dev had given them even a brief glance rather than just logging into the AWS console and clicking start instance this wouldn't have happened.
If you head over to the AWS forums it's packed with people that did the same thing (well, 2 or 3 threads per day).  They put some business-critical data on the instance store, then either stopped and restarted the instance, or experienced a failure of the underlying hardware, and then start screaming about how AWS should have protected them or should go to the ends of the earth to help them get their data back.  Even the ones using EBS volumes have losses occasionally because most don't bother to back them up or use even use S3 snapshots.
Personally, for my AWS deployments, I use RAID 10 across 4+ EBS volumes (number as needed for required IOPS) with hourly snaps to S3, daily full backups to an S3 bucket with S3QL, and weekly full backups to the office.  I've had some recent concerns about uptime (no failures recently, feeling "due") and have been considering taking that a step further and migrating all my single-instance storage nodes to dual nodes in two AZs using drbd and a floating elastic IP.

Just sell off your BTC for USD, then either buy the GLD ETF, or go buy some physical gold from APMEX (there are alternatives, I just recommend them since they're who I use for buying and selling, mostly selling these days).
With the ETF you don't have to worry about shipping fees, premiums over spot, possible theft, and the taxes due on sale are limited to the normal capital gains rate of 15%, but there are significant expense ratios (GLD is 0.4%) that eat into your investment over time.
Physical gold on the other hand has to be kept somewhere.  If you don't have an extremely safe place to keep it, you may lose it or have it stolen.  Physical gold is also considered a "collectible" by the IRS and gains are taxed at 28%, meaning, you're going to give up a lot more when you sell than if you just held the ETF.

Nice test.  Makes all the cards directly comparable as opposed to the random settings you get looking at the normal hardware wiki page.
Not a fan of the power chart though, the seriously OC'd CPU skews things a bit...

You can now, you couldn't a decade ago.
Bank verification &amp; fund transfers are done via ACH.  This method typically takes 2 business days if initiated during business hours, 3 if done outside.

This guy is an idiot.  It says all over the AWS site that the instance store is ephemeral and doesn't survive if the instance is terminated or stopped (if it's EBS-based).
It's not a matter of AWS being uncooperative, I've not had any complaints with their service or with their support.  No, it's someone inexperienced with cloud computing (who runs on a single instance, anyway?) who made a mistake and is now trying to shift the blame.
EDIT: By "runs on a single instance", I meant, "keeps data, including backups, on a single instance."
@_date: 2011-08-01 16:30:21
There were backups, they were just kept with the original on the ephemeral drive.

The best way to do that would be to take the $1000 you would have spent, get it in $20s, follow the tutorial below to roll them into a cigar, and then light that puppy up.  You'll recover about the same amount out of the ash as you would out of BTC in 10 years.
EDIT: Because computing will advance so far in 10 years that SHA-256 and ECDSA will be vulnerable.

Note: This is not an endorsement of the plan.  I personally think this is a lousy time to buy gold.

Pricing stinks and no 4x6 option...
