Kevin's real words: Trump never misses an opportunity to show his idiocy.  I'd like to educate him so at Rb very least he will shut up.

I'm 85% BTC 7%ETH 4%LTC 4% small ones like neo icx and xrp.   On two major exchanges.
The crap coin was a large investment I made 18 months ago.
@_date: 2019-07-01 03:41:38
 No.  They delisted the coin.   I can put them in cold storage but there is nowhere to trade them.  Lesson is don't buy a crap coin (xcp).
The PROBLEM is they didn't email their xcp holders that they were delisting.  If they gave me a couple weeks notice I would have hopped in the sight and sold them.   All they do is post articles and they expect you to just constantly monitor the site every week for the rest of your life.  I basically was always staying on top of it and simply missed it for a week and poof! It's gone.
Now, this is a micro example of what could happen with crypto period.  Yes I know I know BTC is decentralized and on and on and on.  And it will keep getting bigger and bigger.  Well Govt wants the $ and there is a good chance they will find a way to shut down BTC and be in charge of some new digital government coin.  
I sure wouldn't put 10k down if someone asked me if BTC would be worth 100k in the year 2030.  Watch out for Government..we could get one of these emails one day for all crypto assets BTC included.

@_date: 2019-06-21 15:16:49
9850 is a dump?
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:46:28
25? Hopefully by December.  That's 2yrs late.  Whoa lotsa $ lost.  (s&amp;p) 
Lesson: don't buy that dip until it's crashed.
@_date: 2019-06-13 17:59:46
Ice cream, Bitcoin, Lotto. Hopefully it gains respectably over lotto soon. One down one to go.

The halving in 2016 really had no effect..the uptrend after was for much different macro factors... so we are just looking at 2013... an entirely different time and market.  The halving is yet another point nobody is sure of.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:29:25
That's insane.  Everyone thought we were gonna go down!

The top will happen in June.

Dump? I see 9850..

Best reply!
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:54:22
They grew up in the .01% and now they are .0000001% but they will be satisfied with nothing less than the .0000000000000000000000000000001%
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:05:23
13,500 is a great sale
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:52:38
Do you think bitcoin would be 10k if they weren't ever  involved?
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:27:24
Reminds me when it went back to 18k and we were on our way to 30k..
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:28:54

I don't think any analysis prior to 2017 should count.

When we are in a bull market he gives a high prediction and then he gradually lowers it and at some point he will go mute.  Wash rinse repeat.

Sold, it was actually 30 on the 100 Gain 
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:06:47
That's the amount I'm invested in..around 16k. 
It's almost all I have. I'm 37. I know, I'm an idiot, but not a lot of people were saying that a few months ago. It's a bitch, but I made the decision. Who knows what the future is...All I know is the pain isn't THAT bad because it was MY decision.  I wasn't robbed and the only way I've made anything was by taking huge risks.  Part of me is proud that I can say that and know it will pay off one day..in business, in athletics, relationships, life...in a tremendous amount of ways.  And that is freeing.  More will come of the crypto markets than just financial gain..
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:25:08
Sell half.  You just wanna get all out. You can hold off..If it's not back by July 1 sell the other half.
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:02:26
Millennials won't save crypto because they don't have $ and we can't wait 5 more years for them to save a little dough to invest.  We need people in their 40's and 50's and we need them soon.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:09:23
Yes, If I base my investing on Clif High I probably need professional help..
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:56:55
I put 14k in, then another 20k, And so on.  I ended up putting 100k in and turning it into 200k, in 2017.
I took 200k and put it all in, in January.  So 100k is house money.  My intention was to always risk 100k. But It started out by wanting to only risk 14k. I had to also pay 40k in taxes from my 100k short term gain in 2017.   So I am in deep water. That part kills me.
The point is, besides it being my own damn fault, it slowly spiraled out of control.  I should have only risked 25k of my own hard earned $.  Lesson learned.  I've been in the traditional markets for 20yrs mostly the s and p 500 fund, besides a year of day trading.
Who knows what the 2nd half of 2018 will bring us!  I think crypto can still be huge.  If we bear market for 6 months it's fine.
@_date: 2018-02-19 00:05:28
The key point to get by is 11,500, add a good news story After that and BOOM! bull ride

Was this video recorded today (March 4th)? How does someone change a volume candle? Is this verified? Never heard of anything like it before.
@_date: 2018-03-31 11:16:20
I'm diversified but 1/2 of it is in BTC @ 16k and I still think BTC will make it to 18k this yr
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:52:30
Anything to do with that phrase, even the beloved bitcoin..makes me want to vomit.
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:58:45

Ok always important to check back on these posts!! We are now at 10,400 on 2/23.  What is his call? 13,880 on 2/28? 
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:31:15
Well yeah usdt been on our minds for 4 months now
@_date: 2018-03-05 03:05:18
Yeah but he might be asking what happens to bitcoin and crypto markets when the audit results come back and the tether bomb explodes? 
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:52:38
All easy in retrospect.  I have 300k saved. I started by putting 14k in. I took more Chances and eventually put 100k in.  I turned 100k into 200k. That's not bad.
This year I put 200k in at highs in January.  It was somewhat gradual.  The part that screwed me up was the 40k tax bill. 
Nobody ever throws it all in.  It happens gradually and you use some control. I've been safely invested in traditional markets for close to 20 years.  
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:16:54
Not yet!
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:15:12
Pretty sure if you sold your bitcoin for another coin you got some taxes too..
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:43:49
It's a little ridiculous with all the good news present, as well as the FUD cleared up, for the market to be where it's at.  It's really hard for me to say what's going on.  I know futures and whales/manipulation  have a part in all this, but it seems off to me.
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:28:08
Long term cap gains tax is 15% so yes always tax in US.  Closer to 30% under a year tho..or if you're a BOSS trader, even higher

Oh my gosh I almost feel like I'm in 2018 with these wallets

Yup down well into six figures it's a bitch pretty simple

Diversified, but diversified in crypto isn't really diversified

Only unfortunate part is he is UNHAPPY..
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:56:40
He was hesitant, but very positive on it.  Not as Much as our Hero Giancarlo, but still on board.
Of course he was cautious, but he seemed more positive on Bitcoin than the other currencies, and now he appears to be pulling back.  A delay is expected for rest of year, but they do need to start moving forward.
