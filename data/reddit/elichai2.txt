Bitcoin is dying :( all because of ghash.io. the community need to ban ghash.io and stop accepting their blocks, until they get under 30%.

ammm this is a bit diffrent.
I added an option to try replacing more than 1 letter.
And i added an option to remove the last letter if it's too long.
and to try generate another letter if it's too short
@_date: 2014-11-25 17:04:07
I added the repeating letter option.
I'll think about the other ones.
@_date: 2014-11-25 15:16:26
Fixed :)

When you think Bitcoin core developers will have to do a hard fork? (and then all the awesome stuff will be added :) )
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:09:02
I would love to help you. It's really easy. open an Issue on my Git with the error and the OS and i'll try to help.

I blame FBI in conspiracy of trying to kill Bitcoin:
Tx that trying to make us fear:
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:29:19

@_date: 2014-11-25 15:44:56

@_date: 2014-10-07 09:56:38
what are you trying to say with that link?

You can see what i changed, i added to keyconv '-d' option to decrypt the encrypted key.
And i merged some other changes that other people made, like adding Litecoin address's option. 
And fixed a bug that the program crashed because of a NullPointerException sometimes.
And fix's the problem in Mac OS with detecting how much Threads the CPU has.

Hi, I just added `swapping two consecutive letters` check, and I wanted to know if trying to replace every char any then try swapping will be a good feature or nobody will want something like that?

they can just implement my code...
the license allows them to use it if their project is open source too.
@_date: 2015-01-11 12:10:21
you can just use my tool next time, don't publish your private key online.

So why don't you just signal Segwit? You can add it to your bitcoin.conf and signal it without UASF
@_date: 2017-04-11 18:22:09
What's wrong with that? 
@_date: 2017-04-11 19:00:52
Just add to the end of bitcoin.conf something like "uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP148;WaitForConsensus" and that's it. (of course after you did port forwarding so you'll be considered a full node)

It's a great site.
If you want you can vouch for me:

You can't contact Reddit about it?
