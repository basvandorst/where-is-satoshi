It is a bit out of date. The weibo (tweet) was posted last Friday, in response to the FUD news that night.
Today's rumor has not been commented by PBoC yet.

Thanks for the site.
Now we can monitor it more precisely.

Hey, I am from China.
The truth is the government has never banned Bitcoin. It just banned financial institution from doing relevant business but that is a tricky order because in the announcement the gov. never defined what "financial instituion" or "relevent business" is. And it is not hard for a Chinese to see the gov. meant to keep the vagueness which will spare some space for any movement in the future.
Yesterday's rumor is very likely to be a conspiracy of some evil whale. Now there has been more than one bountis offered in the Chinese bitcoin community on search for the source and have them pay the price.

How hard?

screencapture and blockchain transaction page please. Or you are claming something very risky

6th? How did you get that rank?
@_date: 2014-02-08 15:04:23
+0.2 USD

Well, I guess it's because many people admire him and care a lot about his view

No, I got my real BTC back just 5 minute ago, here is the [proof](
Feel so grateful to [Josh](

I don't know what to say. True or not, somebody may get hurt.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:18:27
I never considered this a bullish signal. As a man who still has assets trapped in MtGox, I am just keeping my eyes on any information concerning this tragedy and sharing anything that might help.

an esssy worth reading for anyone who wants to learn about Bitcoin from the very basis.
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:47:08
Looking forward to it!

What I am interested is how much has been lost from the hot wallet
@_date: 2014-02-01 17:05:16
If you mean the QT client, you may copy the client folder and the blockchaim data (google the directory) to your new computer. And I highly recommend you encrypt your wallet with a strong password if you haven't, before you transfer it.

Congrats! More and more customers will come because of this.

You may consider this as a process of decentralization of centralized exchanges. From the history it clearly has helped enhance the satbability the bitcoin price. But the effect will decrease when there are hundreds or thousands of them and there exist many other factors e.g. regulation or the technical advancment,  that have impacts on the price.

I had the same problem once. Don't understand why they hadn't fixed the English tranlsation yet.
But you are right, they have a good support team.
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:15:12
hard to say at the moment. MtGox keeps fucking everybody and we don't know when it will come to the end.
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:10:17
Most big exchanges offers API. Check their websites.

This looks like a dangerous link when it informed me I need a Flash Player which I have had. And I extract the so called Installflash.exe it appeared to be something different.
@_date: 2014-03-09 08:44:38
Jealous of you!
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:48:44
Really? From my understanding, it is the founder of PayPal who is behind isntead of PayPal the company.
@_date: 2014-03-15 16:11:40
As a Chinese, I would say these are really good works.
@_date: 2014-02-18 02:13:50
Have you tried checking it on blockchain.info?
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:11:05
the WTF button is equal to a "help" buttom
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:20:39
Thank you for the information, though I feel least surprized to know that.
edit: grammar
@_date: 2014-03-22 06:18:54
Some bad hackers mush hate to see this.
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:42:36
I have to say the description of China is a bit imprecise. There are still dozens of seeds growing underneath the surface.
@_date: 2015-02-26 03:09:38
just another over-rated event
