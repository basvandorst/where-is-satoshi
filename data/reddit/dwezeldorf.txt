Well like I said, I don't have any money to invest in bitcoins or I probably would, and don't have a good enough computer to mine, so what could I do to get in on it? I don't really have any talents, the only thing I have a shitload of is free time.

Shit, I almost feel like killing myself. I missed my train, man, my chance.

I'm not creative. clever, or have the resources enough to create a new niche for myself. Shit, if I was then I wouldn't be living with my girlfriends family right now.

Same, it makes me a little sick to my stomach when i think about how much money I've lost out on, especially considering how much I'm in a hard place right now.

I'm sitting at my computer watching the bitcoin ticker in a cold sweat and you know how many I have? 0. Not a single coin, because back when I found out about them at about a dollar per, I figured it was going to stay that way and forgot about them until today. Back then I had ~1k a month in disposable income and today I'm jobless and almost homeless and I'm just thinking, "If ONLY I bought just 100 of them. Even 50. Even 10. This will forever go down in my memory as the stupidest thing I have ever done and it sucks.

I have a feeling that once some governments try to crack down on the road (which if I know the USA, they will), the bitcoin market is gonna crash back down until there's another market created that sells illegal and/or hard-to-obtain goods.
