The US government has other pressing problems. With Fort Meade, Maryland now globally declared a legitimate target for a thermonuclear strike, they may want to negotiate with the Russians, the Chinese, and everybody else who has a vested interest in pressing the notorious launch sequence button. I hope that nobody agrees to negotiate over this. Just do it. What a relief it will be when I wake up and Google Maps tells me that all that is left from Fort Meade, Maryland is just a thermonuclear crater.

This is going to go right until it goes wrong. He may get visitors telling him to hand over the key to his wallet. After that, they will put him on a gag order not to disclose this. Then, he will no longer take bitcoin.

No. What happened is that someone like the NSA can read all your email, all your data on a windows computer, and start fishing for your wallet keys, and automatically steal all your money. They can also easily impersonate exchanges and online wallet servers. All of that is entirely automated. I do not know which secret service is now feasting on your money, because that depends on the country where you are.

Ha. It is already corrupted. With the NSA reading all your email, fishing for your keys, fishing for your admin passwords, impersonating exchange and wallet sites, look at the greatest theft in the history of mankind right in front of you!

He is probably under gag order about this. I do not believe for a second that Ross Ulbricht will ever disclose anything about what exactly happened, because that will make things very bad.

There must be ways around that too, I guess. Wasn't that guy a public defender? If they promise him a few tens of thousands out of the loot, everything becomes possible, of course.

The problem is not the cost of insurance/arbitration. On the contrary, the service often makes sense. The problem is the lack of competition in that realm. Why should the credit card companies monopolize this field? With bitcoin we can now open up the market for this kind of services.

Yes, true, but there is another problem. This person knows who you are. He knows where to find you. He knows your net worth. He also knows where it is stored. The most interesting business consists in transactioning your balances away simply by transactioning you away. You are effectively creating a bounty on your own head by trusting this person.

Concerning the NSA, someone, somewhere will carry out the long overdue thermonuclear strike on Fort Meade, Maryland. I am betting on the Chinese, but it could be the Russians or even another military entity. You see, the NSA are targetting and attacking the entire world population. They are the most legitimate target ever in history for thermonuclear eradication. We just need to get someone to finally press that button and get it over with.

With the secret services reading all your email and fishing for private keys, fishing for admin passwords, and impersonating bitcoin exchanges and online wallet sites, there is indeed a serious security issue:
ALL YOUR BITCOIN ARE BELONG TO US!

The NSA will keep reading all the email, keep getting hold of all your keys and admin passwords, keep impersonating exchanges and online wallets, and become the richest bunch of guys on the planet.

The banks have a monopoly on another game that is much more important to them. They know exactly what your net worth is, which is effectively a bounty on your head. They know exactly where you are. In order to transaction your balances away, they have a hidden business that consists in transactioning you away.

All the small bits add up, don't they? Let's write another automated regular expression matcher for private wallet keys and admin passwords.

Nobody needs quantum resistant cryptography. With the -- for the Chinese -- very insulting NSA shenanigans behind the Great Chinese Firewall, what we need now is that the Chinese finally carry out a long overdue thermonuclear strike on Fort Meade, Maryland. That will be the end of FOXACID, QUANTUM and all other NSA bullshit. I wonder what the Chinese are waiting for? Press that button right now, will you!

Will [ ] prevent NSA contractors from transactioning away your money? No.
