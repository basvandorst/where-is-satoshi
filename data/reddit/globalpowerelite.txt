It’s all about control and leverage. Whatever system they put in place to back this world currency will benefit them.

Like Breton Woods, they will create a new model for exchanges and interest, that will consolidate their power. And whatever collapse occurs, they will not pay or lose money, they will ensure that the taxpayers will pay for their risky financial derivatives.
