I don't honestly know a lot about that, but in order to do that you have to be stage 2 verified, which it won't complete in the US (except for one or two states i believe)

How did they know the check was real? Just because it says its from the government doesn't mean it was.
That is why they hold checks until they clear, to make sure it was a legitimate check.
That being said, it's unbelievable to me that in this day and age they couldn't come up with a better system then what they currently use. There is no reason that banks couldn't have a system where when A gets a check from B they can instantly verify it.
@_date: 2014-11-29 08:45:04
You're missing the point - it has absolutley nothing to do with the number of transactions. They were displaying transactions as valid that were not valid. The point of a bitcoin client is to NOT do that.
It is not up to the API consumer to handle checking at that layer. Yes, requiring confirmations would mitigate it, but that is not the point. There is a reason bitpay and coinbase accept 0 confirmation transactions - because it can be done safely with little to no risk - and comes with a tremendous benefit to the consumer.

It is not security through obscurity - masternodes are open source, darksend is being open sourced in a week and a half.
@_date: 2014-08-06 07:35:14
There actually is a good explanation for this!
With DO - wayyyy back in their early days, they had no problem with people mining cryptocurrency. After a while however, they found something out, most of the time, its done with stolen credit cards or paypal accounts. Why? Because as they point out - mining bitcoin on a cloud VPS is not profitable. You would be significantly better just putting the money on a number on a roulette table. As a result, they're hesitant to have people mining.
However that being said, as for the X resources for Y time - I have a digital ocean droplet that has near 100% CPU 24/7. It's been that way for 6 months. DO is pretty good about giving you what you pay for (Because they use zen for virtualization, which gives each VM full use of its allotted resources, and doesn't share them with neighbors)
Other VPS companies often will terminate your account if you have 100% CPU usage for any significant period of time. They typically are using the openvz architecture, because it allows the company to significantly oversell their servers. As a result, anyone using too much of the resources harms their neighbors. However these servers are typically much cheaper and as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.
@_date: 2014-09-06 20:52:36
Well to be fair one of the very cool things about bitcoin is if you do in fact have 100m in bitcoin (though you said made, not have, I doubt you would leave it all in bitcoin) you can sign a message from the address(es) the coins are associated with to prove it.
But you've given enough gold away that true or not, you're getting people to be introspective and have deep thoughts, something we are not called to do this very often in life, so even if you are 100% full of shit, the end result is positive.
@_date: 2014-11-29 00:58:57
So it looks like this is actually a big deal - unfortunately I don't think the OP did a very good job of explaining the issue - which led more readers to not dig in and find the issue for themselves.
If you look at the parent transactions, you will reach this one: 
Which contains the transaction that will be rejected, but blockchain will validate the children of, just without ever getting confirmations.
So while yes, waiting for confirmations is one solution - most of the time that just is entirely unnecessary and a big pain.
This isn't a true double spend because it isn't the bitcoin network at fault, it's blockchain.info's faulty validation.
@_date: 2014-11-29 08:48:36
Blockchain was displaying transactions as valid that were not - that was the fundamental problem.
The accepting 0-confirmation transactions is an entirely different issue (one I don't disagree with you entirely on). That being said, bitpay and coinbase both are fine with 0 confirmation transactions, so making it sound like only idiots are doing it is off-base.
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:27:20
You miss the point. Are they instant in theory or in practice? Because if they were instant in practice why did it take an hour and a half for bitstamp to confirm my transaction from bitfinex early today?
While they are instant and safe 99% of the time in theory - that's not how it work in the real world.

@_date: 2014-11-29 00:55:23
That isn't the problem in this case. The problem is blockchain.info is saying  a transaction that shouldn't be valid, is in fact valid. If you go to the previous transactions in the chain, you can find the transaction that is not valid - which blockchain is saying is valid.

How is there any fail at all? The fact that one of the merchants takes bitcoin (which I would pay them with, if I had it enough at the time of purchase) doesn't have anything to do with the sentiment of my "bitching."

I didn't necessarily articulate the privacy issue quite like I wanted to, but my post was already too long so I decided against expanding on it.
Everything you said is correct. I don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy from my bank when I use my bank issued credit card to make a purchase.
My issue is that there isn't an alternative. I willingly give them access *only so much as willingly means I have absolutely no other choice* on the matter if I want to have a credit card, which is required to shop at most online stores.
In terms of privacy, I more was trying to highlight that bitcoin makes it a non-issue.

During development. So copy coins couldn't take an unfinished protocol and implement it, then blame darkcoin if there were any flaws.
Instead it will be open sourced once it is ready, at which point is looking to be in the next couple weeks.




Source? 


Evan is willing to consider anything, but after even a tiny bit of research it is very clear why it was decided to avoid this.


Compared to the majority of other coins, that is just false. But the biggest difference, is with other coins it is clear that the spamming comes from the top and is encouraged by the developer. Evan is the exact opposite of that.

Anyone who thinks any altcoin - unless it had something truly revolutionary to the point I can't describe it - will usurp bitcoin anytime soon is delusional.
But at the same time, anyone who thinks that no altcoin stands a chance of sharing the marketspace is equally delusional.
Unfortunately, creating new coins is so easy it became a target for scam artists and a horrible stigma became attached to altcoins, because most of the time they were in fact a scammy shitcoins.
But if a coin has developers who are doing innovative things - not just making fancy graphics, there is a potential for multiple useful cryptocurrencies to co-exist.
@_date: 2014-08-06 07:46:43


Trust me, they aren't thinking of you at all! Back in the day (say a year or so ago) they used to be very okay with cryptocurrency mining. I say this because I used them heavily to mine a couple altcoins. (Paid them at least $1,000 - so a pretty significant amount of servers).
However their policy changed some time since then because they found that most people mining on their hardware ended up being fraudulent, paying with either stolen credit cards or paypal accounts. This is why they make the point about money - because it is so unprofitable, it only makes sense to do if you aren't actually paying.
I think it's also the reason for the exposition. They don't want to be seen as anti-bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:12:34
Well, if it was properly planned, and you got the 3 biggest mining pools to support it and set a date a month in advance, I don't see it really being an issue. The average user wouldn't even be affected.
@_date: 2014-09-07 15:25:38


It really is not that complicated to see.
Company sells products. They pay 3% of all sales to credit card companies for processing.
Do you think companies just eat that cost? It depends on the store and the specific products in question, but on average, you pay between 1-2% more for everything as a result.


Yes you can... 


This actually is a very interesting point, and I will give you credit where it is due. You probably are correct on this one. But I don't think credit cards need to go away either. Simply pointing out the fees, and the 1% return you get is money you already paid to the retailers who then paid the credit card company in fees.

Except the "centralization" isn't that.
A centralized solution would be one where a single authority controlled the network.
That is not the case, masternodes are distributed across hundreds of people without ANY central authority of point of failure with the only requirement to run a masternode be having a vested interest in the success of the currency by holding 1000 DRK in your wallet.
Moreover, it's not fundamental to the currency - you don't have to use them if you don't want to, it simply is a benefit for those who do want to.

Unfortunately it no longer exists on blockchain.info and I didn't save the raw data after I was done examining it.
The transaction was not valid - which is why the original never confirmed, however blockchain.info was reporting it as valid, albeit with 0 confirmations.
I do remember the first op_code was OP_FALSE yet it paid to a 0 of 2 multisig - so I believe anyone could have spent the tx, except for the OP_FALSE, so the tx never made it to the network, nor would the tx ever be included in a block.
So that is how they were able to "spend" from a tx that technically was invalid, because blockchain.info was reporting it as valid.

After reading this thread I am honestly considering selling all of my bitcoins. If the community is truly this dense, bitcoin has no chance of a future.
Your idea is dead on - use terms _anyone_ will understand, the accuracy is much less important. Then, once they are interested, then you can start talking about what it really does. That is pretty basic marketing - and it works, because it gets past a HUGE barrier: people stop listening the second they don't understand something. If you start your explanation with the word decentralized - if the person hasn't heard that term commonly used, their brain will stop paying attention right there.

GeoIP data is just about worthless. My IP address is about a thousand miles off right now.

You can make all the conspiracy theories you want about the fed reserve, etc, but why would they purposefully use a non-government ip address which is mapped to washington dc and more specifically with the geoip right on the white house?

Empathy is all it takes to solve most of the world's problem, but a seemingly majority of humans lack any sizeable amount of empathy to make that happen.
The innovators of the world - they are successful because they can empathize with their customer, seeing what they need even when they don't know what they themselves need. (Henry Ford: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”)

The idea that banks will just completely go out of business anytime soon is very misguided, sometimes it is important to read between the lines in this subreddit.
From the beginning of the industry until today, consumers have not had much of a choice. You cannot get by without a bank - whether it be for loans, credit cards, checking account, etc.
But the thing that drives most people into the bank is the checking account -&gt; debit card -&gt; credit card. And this is the aspect of banking that bitcoin can critically interrupt.
There still will be a large demand for credit though, as long as we live in a society rooted in capitalism, I can't see that ever NOT being the case.
But if people don't need a checking account or credit card to pay for things anymore, banks will actually have to compete to stay in business, and the predatory practices currently in use by many banks won't work -  because there will be another bank who won't do it.
@_date: 2014-09-06 20:39:12
The best part of the whole thing, is after my credit card was declined I paid with bitcoin instead.
I didn't originally pay with bitcoin because I didn't have enough in my wallet and I wasn't going to break out cold storage just to pay with bitcoin.
So how did that transaction look? Bitcoin purchased on coinbase, immediatley sent to BitPay, which then was (most likely) settled as cash to the merchant.
And while that is not ideal - it's inefficient for a whole host of reasons - **it still was faster than dealing with wells fargo,** the whole process taking under 30 seconds.

There are two, distinct namecheap transactions. The first transaction, occurred a week ago and is the one I referenced in the post itself. This was one of the transactions that was listed when I was verifying my recent transactions. This was made by credit card for a whole host of reasons that I've already explained. This charge went through no problem.
Then, yesterday there was a second namecheap transaction, this was the one discussed in my comment. I tried to pay with credit card, and had it declined. It is at this point in which I have to purchase bitcoin (because I don't have enough in my wallet to cover the purchase price) and then make the payment to namecheap with bitcoin.
So to your last line, I have no idea what you think I did or didn't do, but where you say "you didn't" what really happened was I did just that. I did do that when I payed namecheap.
And my "bragging" was merely about the fact that with bitcoin, even the hoops I had to jump through in this case was quicker than having to deal with my bank. How that is even remotely a fail just does not make even a bit of sense.

A single card itself, yes, can be created and shipped, including wages for those doing that, for well below $15.
However that doesn't take into account the infrastructure required to be able to do so, so until they sell n cards, it is still a loss.
However given they have raised $20 million, I can't imagine those costs are of too much concern, rather it is a price high enough that the users they get will only be those who actually plan on using it.

This sounds like a good idea - especially for seeing if anyone can break your system - however there is a flaw.
With spreads as large as they currently are, setting up multiple accounts and transferring money from one to the other would be very easy to do.
Given someone already has 100 XBT I'm curious if that has already been exploited.

No, it's a security flaw. The transaction was an invalid transaction - it will not be accepted by miners and never will be included in a block.
It is not up to programmers of individual applications to ensure that every transaction from the coinbase tx where it was mined to the point at which it was spent is valid - that is almost the entire point of wallet software, whether it be the bitcoin-qt client or blockchain.info.
Thus it was a bug in the software, not up to a developer utilizing the blockchain api.

Fine yes, if you include everything released, from linux core to a shitty library I wrote three years ago that I explicitly didn't spend any time thinking about security vulnerabilities because of it's use case, then yes.
But if we are reasonable and only include maintained projects that are intended for production use, security issues absolutely are the exception.
And for the context of this discussion, the projects I just excluded are completely irrelevant. The projects being referenced all are in the intended for production use category.

How do you purpose we trace someone to an IP they used five years ago? Sure, if it was used today you MAY be able to convince someone in the ISP to leak information, but from 5 years ago? Those records surely do not exist anymore.

- the only part that's not Bitcoin code is closed source. And it's basically just a flawed version of CoinJoin. CoinJoin was created for Bitcoin and works just fine, no need to create a new coin for that.
- lies, promises, and more lies. They keep saying they will open source it, but it never happens.
- Another lie: They got scared by the ring-signatures innovation that the cryptonote coins are using to achieve a higher level of privacy than CoinJoin (according to Gregory Maxwell, creator of CoinJoin) so they said they were going to add that to Darkcoin. Guess what, that never happened because *insert excuse here* (the truth is the creator of Darkcoin is not a cryptographer).
- at some point someone posted in bitcointalk.org a method to deanonymize Darkcoin using that masternodes mess. Raw CoinJoin is much better as expected, because it was created by an actual cryptographer. They have probably now "fixed" that as many coins do, but it's always a temporary solution. Instead of solid cryptographic design, they just love to play whack-a-mole with the vulnerabilities.
Literally all of those are 100% false. There are a few tiny kernels of truth you're grasping at, but none of it is true.
It was not insta-mined - there was a short period with higher mining rewards than desired, but by doing even the tiniest bit of blockchain analysis you will see this just is not an issue.
Masternodes are 100% open source and have been since the beginning. Everything is open source except darksend which has been kept closed source for a very good reason. Sept 29 is when it will be open sourced. It's not "it never happens..."
Name one single lie. You cannot.
Evan said he would look into ring signatures. Because he is interested in building the best crypto possible by being innovative, not sticking with the current solution just because it's there. However he concluded that they suck - they are not practical and should not be implemented in darkcoin.
If someone posted a method for deanonymization please share it with us! That is a serious issue! But as someone whose followed darkcoin since february, I've not seen this method or heard of it outside of FUDsters like yourself. So please, share it.

Read the paper itself again it explains this quite well.


That is 100% false. Decentralization =/= partial centralization =/= centralization.
Also at this moment there are less than 7300 full bitcoin nodes running. Are there only 7300 people who use bitcoin? Because if not bitcoin is running in a partially centralized manner as well.

Exactly, that was my point, there are a million ways he could have prevented his actual IP from being leaked. But as I said in a different reply, even if it had, 5 years later no ISP is going to have any information on it still. It potentially could give us a city, but my IP is mapped to a city 300 miles away from where I am now, so at best we would have a country.

It won't matter.
These companies that become popular won't be a necessary part of the equation. If you want to use a company fine, but at the most fundamental level, with bitcoin, I won't have to. I can just use the wallet I use now.
@_date: 2014-11-29 08:59:33
Unfortunately the tx no longer is on the website, but the OP_FALSE I was referring to was in the output script of the original transaction, not the input scripts like with the transaction you list. (blockchain.info correctly displays output scripts -  the previous tx to the one you linked, where blockchain was displaying OP_FALSE in the input)
So while a 0 of 2 multisig would have been a valid transaction, prepending it with OP_FALSE would, I believe, invalidate the transaction
@_date: 2014-09-10 20:51:55
Yes. While coinbase could easily track the coins, they have absolutely no idea if the intermediate wallet is you, or if you paid someone and they decided to gamble it.
Moreover they don't care. When they can readily know the address you're sending coins to is an illegal gambling site, they potentially could be held liable - so they simply want people to add a hop between themselves and any "trouble" to avoid that kind of liability.

I have on many of your other posts in this thread - you have not replied to a single one of them.
You have not made a single valid criticism of darkcoin in this thread - I concede there absolutely are some you could make, but all you are doing here is spreading absolute lies. Go respond to my other posts where I refute everything you say if you wish to keep the discussion going.
@_date: 2014-09-07 15:32:19
You're first half is 100% spot on.: Bitcoin will not solve the problem of greed.
But that is not an argument against bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-07 02:10:56
It is a little bit about bitcoin. It is about the larger ecosystem which bitcoin is part of, so while not directly being about bitcoin, it is not unrelated to bitcoin.

In my comment above, I forgot to include it, but that was an additional payment to namecheap, which I did pay with bitcoin.
I want a payment method on file that can be charged at time of renewal, so I keep a credit card attached to my account for that reason.
If I don't have enough bitcoins in my wallet at the time of purchase I'll usually just pay with my credit card instead of breaking out cold storage or buying more just to pay with.

Okay fine, but that has literally nothing to do with this thread. In a alternate world where I had done that we still would be here.
But moreover, two posts ago you said I was "bragging" for that same process that now you're saying I am "fail" because I didn't do it for a different transaction.
As for why? Because it was an automatic renewal. I had no part in part in it, and last time I checked bitcoin doesn't offer that.
I don't get you. We're both bitcoin supporters, yet you're attacking me for supporting the same goal as you for what reason? Whatever it is it's people like you who make this ecosystem toxic and only weaken the community.
I just ignored you so if you respond don't expect me to respond back.

No that would most likely not have worked. Past tense because blockchain has already fixed the issue.

Not only bullish "most revolutionary projects in recent time".
I love digital ocean and honestly even though this post is negative their attitude does kinda make me like them more...
But I don't like how quick they are to terminate accounts - I get they need to in order to not be taken advantage of, etc. However they easily could have sent you an email asking for a response within 48 hours or you'd be locked. But from my understanding they've been pretty under-staffed from the beginning, not so much by design, rather they grew too quickly and couldn't hire qualified people fast enough.

I understand the concern about the name, I just take issue with this.
@_date: 2014-09-07 01:58:53
I've had that happen to me once as well, and the bank did catch it before any damage was done.
And sure, that is great, but it only is great because the current financial state of the country relies on the technology that it does.
Every time you use your credit card you have to trust ever hop between the terminal you're swiping your card at, through the company, and to the payment processor. Target, Home Depot, Schnukks, just three examples of major retailers proving that even billion dollar companies are vulnerable. And online it's no different.
However with bitcoin, the only person you have to trust is yourself. When you make a payment, you sign the transaction and send it off. Your private information is not - by the very nature of the platform - leaked to any intermediary along the way.
There is a whole set of potential issues surrounding bitcoin putting that much responsibility on the user - but that is another conversation completely.
@_date: 2014-11-29 10:37:03
Yep, the idea is if you know what percent of the network the transaction has been propagated to, you can derive a confidence level of whether or not a double spend is viable.
This doesn't protect from instances where the attacker would send the transaction directly to a miner and not broadcast it over the network - but the resources involved make it very difficult and expensive to do, so the only transactions where it is a reasonable concern are high value transactions, which absolutely should be waiting for multiple confirmations before confirmation anyway.

Nobody solving these cares about the money. They may use it as a justification for spending hours upon hours of time solving them, but in the end they do it for the love of puzzles.

I'm on my phone so I don't have the link with me, but it's on github. Do you know what a branch is? Make sure you're looking at the right branch, I'm pretty sure the main github page is for the "production" version, whereas masternodes are still in release candidate stage.
