How about setting up a quick predication market using Hanson's market maker (scoring rule) to distribute your initial 10 BTC? That would provide waaaay more liquidity than just spreading 10 BTC. If someone has infrastructure to set up something, contact me.

Haha yes, it is kind of neat how liability also contains Haftung and Pflicht at once ;)

You got my feels. I wouldn't consider arbitrage on low liquidity markets like bitcoin riskless, but any user of any open source tool shit have their shit together enough to understand what's happening. 
Did you use your tool yourself?

Don't forget to add at least $150 for health insurance. And if you want to be on the safe side of life, add another few Euro for a Haftpflichtversicherung. Also about 15 Euro for the GEZ to finance public media.

I think there is a point when the gold nuggets are gone and you need to start to work for the fine gold dust ... ;)

That is exactly why. Be careful, they changed the model of billing: they now bill for each flat, regardless whether you are on your own or in a WG. They don't really care who in a WG they made pay the bills. So first ask your friends/flat mates whether they already are registered - the GEZ happily will let you pay double...those ugly stupid fuckers.

Unfortunately, bitcoin are still seen as something odd and approached with a lot of skepticism on - I'm not going to dig out some threads, but recent attempts at pointing starcraft players and fans to bitcoin ended with quite some ridicule. So it's even more awesome to see some figures like Scarlett and TB embracing it. 
I'd be up for organizing a satellite based tournament system with low buy-ins and several rounds to the top - it would be no problem handling the coins in offline wallets and be pretty safe using dedicated hardware to manage this aspect, but unfortunately running tournaments in this game is watched over, regulated and requires permission by the producer of the game, Blizzard Entertainment. I have no desire to dabble in this international minefield of law and whatever else one needs.

Just because some web apps run doesn't mean apple is keeping bitcoin out of the app space, which is just utter bullshit.
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:30:44
As far as I know they also regulate tournaments with prize items, not just prize money. Like hardware. Certainly bitcoin, if not accepted as a currency, can be seen as an valuable item. It's part of their licence and service conditions somewhere. Unfortunately, they got it covered.

Well, not exactly sure how it is done in his country, but for example in Germany, any tax adviser is liable for what they advise. So if you file a wrong tax statement after consulting with them and doing as they suggested, it is really hard to criminally convict you for it (because you obviously tried to do it correctly, so you're acting in good faith and no fraudulent intent) and any additional damages, fees, or punitive payments that are result of the malpractice can be obtained from the tax adviser, who is liable and will lose any lawsuit about it.
On the other hand, a "real" tax adviser in Germany needs to pass, like a lawyer, quite a number of exams and stuff. Might be different in other countries.

Also, there are guys who downloaded entire Project Gutenberg, Wikipedia and Wikiquotes, splitted it into sencenes, created variants by removing blanks, adding/removing capitalization, l33t and probing all the associated addresses by generating they keys. You can easily get up to a few thousand brainwallets per second with some lame script. Just saying, better stay with high entropy random passwords.
Congrats to your new life, don't forget to consult a professional tax adviser (who in the end will be liable if he gave wrong advice).

That is indeed quite awesome!

Donations are, besides tournament prize money and team salary (if any) still a major source of income for players. Admittedly, Scarlett (  ) is high profile enough to have a decent salary, but this is a very nice example of how to do it.

She'd usually get more than 5k, and recently performed pretty damn well. I think bitcoin is just the icing in this case.

I am so fucking glad google wallet cooperated with me and refunded my order with them.
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:40:20
Negative, they lose money.

I just found out that the German word actually has its own article in the English wikipedia: 
So maybe my advice about trusting a tax adviser is too much in some countries, but probably still better to see one than cashing in all the bitcoins, spending it all and being subjected to a 20% tax afterwards :)
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:40:01
well, you are expected to make
E = 0.495*x - 0.505*x = -0.01*x
so a 1% loss in the long run for the 49.5% game.

I don't think it would matter, since the S&amp;P500 represents the biggest businesses and their revenue shares, it should still be possible to live off it, even if the dollar looses a lot of value compared to bitcoin - you got a nominal amount of shares once you bought in.

You hippie only want peace because you own Yacoin and other altcoins instead of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:32:42
My two cents: 
Cash out some of it that gives a solid start to solid, normal, ETF fund based, but diversified investing. Like $30k or whatever. Leave at least the same amount in Bitcoin, do whatever you want with the rest, like pay of current debt that increases your running costs. 
That way you're safe for a bust in Bitcoins, but also prepaired for a huge bitcoin increase.
This might not provide the biggest payout, but it certainly mitigates the risk.
