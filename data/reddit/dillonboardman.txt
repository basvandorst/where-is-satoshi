But keep in mind the value of Dogecoin.
One Doge = One Doge

I wouldn't worry too much about it. Rumor has it that Dogecoin is going to the moon!

I've been trying the Bitcoin faucets for awhile to learn a bit more about Bitcoin. Honestly, they're not worth it if you're looking to obtain a worthwhile, spendable amount. Some people that sell their code and other products get a pretty good chunk of Bitcoin! 
My recommendation would be to pick up some programming, create an open-source application, and then have a donation address on the site where you have your program. I'm *most likely* am going to be doing this soon once I'm a better Python developer. 
Best of luck to you!

Awesome! I hope I get to use one. I could see this being really useful for people new to Bitcoin to deposit their spare coins in return for Bitcoins.

I don't think that Bitcoin will be taken over by Litecoin or other similar currencies because Bitcoin has the most solid adoption among businesses. It has taken a long time for people to even begin adopting Bitcoin, and I don't think that they would be switching to a new crypto-currency.

If you're trying to find a miner for an old android phone, it wouldn't be worth it. You (most likely) wouldn't be able to mine any Bitcoins. You would be better off just selling the phone for Bitcoins. Cheers!

I'm 16 and I'd gladly use Bitcoin, the only drawback for me is that it is a bit difficult to obtain (I've been hitting up some faucets for the past couple months). Personally, I think it's an absolutely phenomenal idea and it's a shame that more businesses don't accept it! When I manage to wrangle up some bitcoins, you better believe that I'll be using it.

This is awesome! This is one of the few things that Bitcoin has been missing. It needed an Amazon-like place were people can purchase a mass variety of things. Maybe now Bitcoin will start to catch the eye of the general public. This is the future, people!

It'll be interesting to see why percent of campaign money is from Bitcoins, especially between parties, although I sense that libertarians will be contributing more than any other party.

I would find it extremely interesting if a popular bank started integrating Bitcoins. I wonder how popular the option to use Bitcoin would be for Chase bank customers.

I'm also curious. I'm constantly looking at business windows to see a 'We Accept Bitcoin' sign, but my quest has yet to bear fruit. You might want to try looking on Twitter and seeing where other people have gone in your area.
