I personally made a couple of purchases this last month in btc. One for 125 usd and one for 230, sure,. Coukd have more usd now, but i needed those things, and between paying it with a cc or btc i chose btc. If a service i use offers btc payment i use it and then purchase that amount of usd in btc instead of paying my cc the next month. Again, i might loose some money, but it's not about the money, its about sending a message.

A transaction which I made over a week ago wit a 30 sat/byte fee got cleared through the night. Wasn't on a hurry to get it processed that's why the low fee.

So you're saying that if I google Bitcoin a lot then the price will go up?

You don't need to close a channel before you can spend it on the same channel. You need to close it if you want to use those coins elsewhere. But you won't have a channel open with a friend. You will have a channel opened with a hub and that hub will have channels with other hubs which will have channels with people. So if there is a route of open channels between you and a friend he will send you btc and you will have those btc in your contract. Now say you want to spend those coins at starbucks, and they also have an open channel with a hub which is directly or indirectly connected with yours, then you could send them your coins without hitting the blockchain.

I think that you should offer whoever rents your apartment to pay with Bitcoin. That way not only are you hodling, you are also spreading the word

It's not wrong what you say about it being cheaper to all be in the same hub, but it won't be possible for all of us to do so because that technically means that this one entity should have 50% of all circulating bitcoin. There probable wont be thousands upon thousands of hubs, but there will be a fair amount. And the blockchain is still the foundation of it all. Unless your coins appear in the blockchain you wont be able to move them around. You will still hit it every now and then but with bigger transactions than purchasing a latte. And this doesnt mean you loose your coins to a contract since you can always close it and get your coins back on a classic blockchainy address.

That is only true if the price of goods stays the same in btc and explode in usd, if stuff is proced the same in uad but 1btc is worth 100x then the value of bitcoin is going up

It's not the same. If you own a house, the keys are not the "proof" that you own them. With Bitcoin, it kind of is.

That's awesome, hope you keep working on it

Love this quote: "Two years ago, a Silk Road competitor better known as Evolution suddenly vanished out of thin air, making off with millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin – all owned by the users, of course."
Bitcoin is owned by the owner of the private key and no one else.
