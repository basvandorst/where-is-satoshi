I believe the best thing we can do to promote Bitcoin right now is to simply advertise it in areas where it usually isn't being advertised. Ads might seem like the cheap way out, but If we really want Bitcoin to become more mainstream and known we should be putting out some ads. That said I'm honestly not sure if Bitcoin is really ready for mainstream distribution yet, only time will tell. I've had a couple of people ask me about Bitcoin at the supermarket though due to this sticker, so it does work. :) 
As you can see I'm not exactly a great GFX artist but I tried my best. I'm actually going to replace the white with a transparent version (I think the white has too much contrast with the red car) I made them in Paint.NET because I don't have photoshop. I have provided some downloadlinks to the Paint.NET '.pdn' files if you also want to use this for stickers or anything else. 
Here's the version without EFF:

Post here and we got our proof. Then we can actually take you seriously. 
Then we can talk biz'.

Yup, and after that they're selling it to Facebook.

For anyone else wondering, I just found out after googling.
HFT = High Frequency Trading

Why not? Sorry if this is a stupid question, still playing with things and trying to learn.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:47:50
Oh yea, I guess I just never thought about it that way. Guess I'm going to keep the money on Bitstamp for now and keep trading, then set aside some Bitcoins and send them to my wallet. :) Thanks!

This is the group buy: 
And this is a list of miner developers with pricing: 
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:48:58
I'm assuming none of these get you any decent amount of Bitcoins...
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:30:49
$60? It's still at $120 for me...
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:51:29
I use Bitstamp.
However as far as I can tell the DDOS on MtGox is also affecting the other exchanges substantially. :(
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:54:38
There's no delay on mtgox as far as I know at the moment though? I was thinking I could buy on Bitstamp, quickly send them over to Mtgox and sell them there for +10%.
Guess if it was that easy everyone would be doing it...
Anyways thanks for the input, I appreciate all the help I can get from here. The subreddit has been real hostile the past couple of days.

Well yes, it can happen. I bought at $90 like 2 weeks ago, then panic sold at $75 because the price was falling. I did stuff like this several times because I was too cautious. Guess what, the price went to $160 last week. If I had just held onto it I would have been fine and made a profit.
If you're willing to invest into Bitcoin you need to be willing to lose your entire investment in a split second. Imagine if Mt.Gox closed down, a gigantic shitstorm would unfold. You just need to develop brass balls for this market.

I know you probably don't want to give up your strategies here but could you perhaps point me in the right direction? I know a little bit of Python, just checked out the Bitstamp API page and don't know what to make of it really. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:13:17
Hey, thank you for your post!
I've been seeing these posts about wallets here ever since I started trading on Bitstamp just yesterday. I have a few questions about them. What exactly are they used for? Right now I just have my Bitcoins sitting in my Bitstamp account, should I be transfering them to my Bitcoin-qt wallet? Is it safer that way? I'm guessing you have to put them into the wallet if you want to buy something using Bitcoins? 
Sorry if this is a stupid question. It's just that I'm seeing a lot of posts about people encrypting their wallets, backing them up on cloud storage and so on. Just wondering if I am doing something wrong here. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:57:17
Yea I really need to learn to be more patient. I started just yesterday and I really have only put in $50 for now just to test it out. I'll get better at it I'm sure. :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:08:26
I had a feeling I should buy when it spiked to 90, but decided to wait a little. Suddenly it was back to 100 and I decided to wait for it to drop to 95 but then it kept climbing pretty nicely. I then bought at 110, which is not looking too good right now. But I have faith in BTC. :)
Regardless of wether I sell or buy, I feel like I always hate myself afterwards. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 14:08:19
Just buy and hold. Do not EVER panic sell or sell at a loss at all. That's what I've learned in the past 3 weeks. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:02:58
Nice explanation. Posting here so I can remember this when I'm back from work. Thank you. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:01:19
Btw. I meant a figurative beer in form of bitcoins, whatever the price may be ;) - Also you should probably set a time frame because when the price happens to drop to 30USD in 2 months from now then that no longer counts as a free beer. Sorry :P 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:49:36
Yea I did purchase a Bitcoin at Bitstamp, however on Bitinstant they only wanted the Mtgox account number and a dollar amount. I don't get this because I had to give no information on my Bitstamp account or anything. So confused...
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:12:17
I made 2 deposits using SEPA. Both arrived the day after. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 14:52:23
Not even close. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 13:49:09
I also saw that group buy but decided to go with ASIC chips instead. I got 20 for 1.72BTC, assembly will cost me ~100€ at a developer and it will do 5.6GH once it arrives in late July.

What do you use to see the real time data? I use this

Could someone explain to me why this little program is using so many resources? I mean jeez, it's sucking up 700MB of RAM right now...
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:57:18
Beware, Mtgox engine lag nearing 2 minutes. Shits gonna go down soon. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:36:47
Dude I've been seeing your posts here for a while now, it just breached 85 and it's still going up. If it does go down to 30 like you said earlier I WILL buy you a beer! :)
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:29:40
I invested at $93 yesterday, hoping for it to go up to around $100 during the night so I could sell again. 
Woke up just now, $50. Fuck. Me.

Really depends on where you live, here in Germany a KWH can cost like 0.35$
