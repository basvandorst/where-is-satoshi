I think bitcoin will always have some value, but I think 19k will never be seen again. I bet in ten years bitcoin is worth under 1k.

The whole transactions per second vs miners is still murky for me. Yes, you could have 100x miners and transactions per second would be the same, but the mathematical proofs required to complete the blockchain are so complex and require so much processing power it’s not viable on a large scale. At least that’s is my understand.

 a fiat. It’s backed by nothing and has no intrinsic value. Yeah, a government didn’t issue it but it’s still a fiat. 
 it does. The number of transactions being processed right now is a joke. If it actually was used to do business, like visa or Amex or discover, it would break the system. 
 is up with my font. Its big, deal with it. 
 bitcoin is so ridiculously open to market tampering. One person can move the market any way they want if they have enough money to start.

 a fiat currency this is backed by nothing and will go to zero. Its incredibly inefficient. If bitcoin were used for 30% of transactions world wide, it would consume more power than the entire earth generates right now.
