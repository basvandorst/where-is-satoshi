They’ve always produced iPhone displays. This isn’t news.

Good god, this is true art

What do you mean?

Well said.

Great post!

“I missed the dip!” Why do people claim this?
The honest answer is you didn’t plan for the dip. Otherwise you’d already have had an order in the books, in case the price drops.

There are high-trade exchanges, where the minimum is 75K per trade. See Gemini Trading.

No, because I’m not an experienced trader. My guess would be as good as yours, but it would still be 100% a guess. Not advice to give others on investing ;)

Would be cool if he came by this thread and told us his bitcoin story :)

You can’t make this stuff up!

It’s Canadian dollars.
You have to put “20000 CAD to USD” in Google. Not CND.

For million dollar buy/sell orders, an OTC exchange is best. Genesis Trading is a good one. (minimum order is $25K)
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:17:37
Doesn't seem to be much more? $76 vs 69 euros... even with conversion, that doesn't seem like a big difference.

You're not funny.

I ended up using both Genesis Trading and itBit, so I can shed some light on both.
Genesis Trading was by far the better option. They were very prompt, you wire the money to them, they send the BTC directly to your wallet, there's no holding, limits, or delays. Very happy with Genesis.
itBit I would definitely not recommend. They allow you to deposit as much USD as you want, but have a $15,000 withdrawal limit per day (both for fiat and for crypto). So your BTC is basically stuck in limbo with them, and you have to withdraw a little bit of it each day. Not ideal for large transactions.

Yeah, I thought about that, but this is pretty much a throwaway Reddit account...
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:42:14
Ah, good to hear that it worked for you. My concern was if there was any limit to the deposit amount per day on itBit, or if they would reject a 300K deposit, but it seems like there isn't?

When you say "non-sms 2FA" is that for a Mac / Windows wallet or...?

Do we know if Breadwallet is safer than Jaxx? They both use the same type of security, it seems (secret phrases).
