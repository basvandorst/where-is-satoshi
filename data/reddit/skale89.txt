Did you had any trouble with the IRS-equivalent in your country? Did you need to justify the origin of the gains?

Is there any way to measure how much a transaction will weight?

It hit new low and new high at the same time. Seems this universe.

TRX is an acronym for transaction

When a customer pays you, do you accept the unconfirmed trx as a valid payment? (because if the client sets the fee too low you may not get the payment at all)

These big price fluctuations (almost 33% drop in a couple of days) makes BTC more a Share and less a Currency. 
What can happen by the end of the week? It can drop down to 2500? Can it recover and rise up to 4500 again? Will it stay around 3600? No one knows, and that's not a very useful Currency

Deflation is never good for an economy. It lowers the amount people is willing to spend (why would I spend a bitcoin now if tomorrow it'll worth more)

It's a problem definitely.
I made 3 transactions with high fees (241 and 540 Sat/B) and after 4 days they are still unconfirmed. It will make people not trust the platform.

I wish I could, but Litecoin is not as widely accepted as Bitcoin

Better spend them now before it plunges again
