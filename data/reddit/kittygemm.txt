When will it be implemented?

Let's here some numbers, people? Otherwise it is just empty rhetoric.

Why the fall to 8k?  Why not stay the same or go up?

Thanks for all the replies.  Especially the people that circled back after I asked for clarification.
I think have have wrapped my head around it now.  Thanks to the answers here.
In a nutshell:
1. The odds of even duplicating a public/private key are astronomically low
2. Even if you did "re-use" a generated key pair -- statistically unlikely -- you would never know it anyway (it would take much longer to check for balances, or transfer away anything, than to generate a key pair initially)
(Re:  for some reason I was thinking that simply generating a public/private key pair somehow spoiled it.)
On some level I knew the answer, but had to flesh it out which now I have done thanks to the responses.  I think. :P

Well I don't mean to crack a specific key.  I rather mean simply generating trillions and trillions of public/private key pairs, to thusly "invalidate" a significant number of Bitcoin addresses.
If 0.0001% can be invalidated (which is an arbitrary figure I pulled out of thin air) the public sentiment will be "Bitcoin is comprimised" and the value will plummet.

You don't need to guess one.  You just need to generate trillions upon trillions of public/private pairs.
Would you want to store much $$$ in a crypto if you knew 0.0001% of the public/private keys have already been generated, and you could be using a duplicate, thus theoretically be vulnerable?
(I am not trying to argue with you.  I am just trying to wrap my head around this. :))

Here is the thing.  If a supercomputer can "map out" a significant portion of keys (I arbitrarily picked 0.0001%), it could be done just to wreak havoc on Bitcoin, and not necessarily to steal $$$.
And I just picked the 0.0001% figure.  If someone does the math, maybe it is .1% or even higher!  In which case, heck, the world will completely lose faith in Bitcoin if this is true and become public knowledge.  Even if no funds are stolen!
(What if a government wanted to collapse the overall value of Bitcoin, secretly?  Id they can invalidate a good %, that would do the trick.)
