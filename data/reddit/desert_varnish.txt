Yup, that's how nodes work. You download the blockchain and pass it along to others. There's no real central authority (aside from bootstrapping nodes and stuff) so it's all peer-to-peer.
Note that, to set this up, you would have either connected your node directly to the internet (i.e. no NAT or firewall) or forwarded port 8333 on your router to your node.
Unfortunately I could certain groups targeting IP addresses with open port 8333, in hope of hacking in and stealing coins or whatever. Probably not a huge deal, but if you're paranoid you can try doing port scans of your IP address from elsewhere on the internet, and see if anything else is open. (Just make sure you're actually scanning yourself and not some random other person...)

The same principle can apply to both, but for cryptocurrency (or any other high-stakes situation where you're deriving keys) the password needs to be a lot longer. Things like BIP39 use 12 or 24 randomly-chosen dictionary words, which is *about* as difficult to guess as AES-128 or AES-256.

Yeah, but that's not necessarily a problem, as long as your seed is long enough.
[Relevant XKCD.](
Edit: minor changes
Edit2: A four-word passphrase IS NOT enough for deriving keys (see below). This is just an example that random dictionary words have a better difficulty-to-memorize:difficulty-to-break ratio than random characters. For a strong passphrase you need 12 words or more.

This is like a company messily splitting into two separate companies, each claiming to be the original. If you own stock in the parent company you'll own stock in both resulting companies, but the total value might go down in the process.
Except this is Bitcoin, so the value might somehow go *up* instead. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
