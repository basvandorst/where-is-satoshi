I'm from India and here the "central banks" really can't be trusted that much. That's why so many people here have gold, and cash only. 
They don't keep much money in banks. So one day I was reading that bitcoin is kinda like gold. I researched more into it and from what I understand it shouldn't really devalue over time because it's like gold it's limited in supply.

Yeah 0.5 of a bitcoin was a lot for me! It's pretty much all I saved up, and I sold a gold necklace that I was given as a gift :/ . 
Not too many people know about bitcoin well at least none of my friends do. Maybe the older kids know about. But definitely no adults I speak to know about it. 
But I can see how it could do well here. Especially because banking is not too good here: sometimes the government or banks won't let you withdraw money, sometimes shop keeper say the cash you give them is fake, sometimes the bank give you fake cash (I mean how would you know?), once if you remember overnight ₹1000 become illegal a lot of my family members had cash stored in that type of note. 
But when I think about, bitcoin kinda fixes all of this, you have complete control over your money, no one can stop you using it, and you can't make fake bitcoins.

Hey, could you please explain how I would go about making a "clean" seed with the Trezor, and would I still be able to use Electrum if I create a clean seed. The way I have originally gone about it was toI first plugged in Trezor and selected setup hardware wallet from there electrum made the seed. Hence why I feel it could be the weird electrum non-compliant seed. 
And yup I am 100% using a passphrase too :). My understanding though is even if I forget this and the PIN. I'll still be able to recover my wallet using the seed. Is this correct? I'm not too sure of this because, in the Trezor  [documentation]( it says: "The flip side to this extreme level of security is that if you forget your passphrase your bitcoins are lost. Really lost!"
If anyone else would be able to clarify this too that would be great!

Ahh okay so, you use the standard Trezor wallet, and if you ever had issues with MyTrezor, you would just use the seed on a complaint wallet and recover your wallet. Seems like a good idea. I am just holding my bitcoins so the myTrezor web wallet does meet all my needs.
