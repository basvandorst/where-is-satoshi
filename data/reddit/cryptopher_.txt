Sounding more positive with each update. There has been a big rally with certain coins recently. Those tokens will be fixed in value at the time of issue, so further rallies will result in missed opportunities.
Will be great to see BTC-e (in whatever form) back in action again. Here's hoping still! :-)

If they do come back online then I really hope that they wipe the order books. I would hate for my sell orders to kick in before I get a chance to make an active decision.
Also, I wonder if BCH can be used to compensate any deficit left with the affected users.

Bloody hell, I was sat in fiat just a few days before it went offline, then I went all in across a few coins. 
After holding off on withdrawing just a couple of days before the disruption, I now find myself with some relief that I wasn't sat in fiat.
Here's hoping for success for all affected.

Man that sucks :(
I have to say, having all my coins tied up on BTC-e I too feel like walking away from crypto, but whenever I watch from afar I feel like a helpless cryptopleb, a scarred veteran who rants of stories to the kids who bleed faucets dry of satoshis.
I really hope that you, like many others, get your coins back.

Looking forward to this date - I just hope that the coin prices don't tank in the meantime!

I find myself nodding in agreement with everything you say. Part of the feeling (price is too high) is how somebody new might feel, but then the bitterness of a significant price change is how someone who has lost coins/has coins in limbo would feel.
Gotta keep the hope - if anyone can pull this, it's gotta be BTC-e :-)

What about BCH? Won't the exchange have BCH that it can distribute to users?

Had just over $35,000 tied in coins on the exchange at the time, was going to cash out $6500 at the weekend just gone but ended up holding off.
Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Fortunately my initial investment was $1500 about four years ago, so had I acted at the weekend I would not have been feeling quite as gutted as I am now.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:53:56
You and me both. 
I really hope that there will be a way to recover them. I don't mind providing documentation if asked for, I just want to get my coins back like everybody else.

Sorry to hear :-(
I have my holdings in BTC-e too, about $35,000 worth.
I joined BTC-e during the 2013 bubble for a number of reasons:
a) It was easy to use in an environment that is traditionally tricky for noobs to get an understanding
b) It had a chat (trollbox) which was very appealing
c) It offered a nice range of alts, many of which it is a flagship exchange
Unfortunate to be caught with funds in the exchange at the time that it was downed. While BTC-e has a sketchy history, much of which appears to be washing out in various reports now, it has been an absolute stalwart where others have simply failed - probably because it was a front.
I hope that the users, many of which I'm sure will be just those who chose the exchange for the same reasons as myself, won't lose their funds - although I'm mentally preparing myself for that outcome.

Their PAMM service ( is returning 404 now whereas until a few hours ago it was loading just fine.
It has been far too long since last communication, even by BTC-e's standards.
This exchange has been a stalwart within the crypto exchange community. Even if this is genuine downtime the way in which things have been handled, especially at a time of uncertainty within the Bitcoin community, it is very damaging to their operation.

Which must be why they have auctioned off seized Bitcoins in the past, to "discourage use and ownership of bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:42:05
Nobody can say for sure just yet, but the information so far is very concerning :-(

Assuming my current inability to access the coin I was trading on my account then $35265 invested into 2.4 BTC, 7100 PPC and 6770 NMC. Not having a great week...

It's a tricky one. The criminal allegations is obviously not great, but then again it's not like major banks are not associated with crimes not too dissimilar from this.
The fact that BTC-e is down at all makes me sad, given that it has proven itself to be very reliable and a generally enjoyable place to be around e.g. chatting with regulars in trollbox. There are many folk who will have been caught out by this - I just hope that there is some means for holdings to be recovered for those BTC-e users affected by this.

Translation from Google Translate:
More detailed information about what happened to the BTC-e service.
On July 25, 11:00 the FBI staff came to the data center where our server equipment was located and seized all equipment, the servers contained databases and purses of our service.
Almost for 6 days we could not get from our hosting provider the sane information, what happened to our servers because of this information we publish only now.
July 28, the domain was confiscated.
To date, part of the service facility was arrested by the FBI
The next update will include information on what options are available to restore the service, and also the procedure for obtaining funds, in the event that the service is not started. In the current situation, if the service is not started before the end of August, then from September 1 we will start the process of refund.
In the next 1-2 weeks, we will evaluate and publish information about how much money fell into the hands of the FBI and what amount of funds is available for return.
For all those who buried us, I will remind you that the service has always worked on trust and we are ready to answer for it.
The funds will be returned to everyone!
Arrest of the Russian Vinnyk Alexandra:
Officially declare - Alexander was never the head or employee of our service.
Sincerely btc-e
P.S. In the subject write questions as far as possible we will answer them.

Ouch, that sucks man.
I was going to move the profits from my latest long (~5 BTC) into my private wallet around that time but couldn't get into it - was waiting on a 2FA disable request to approve. Of course, hindsight tells me that I should have created a fresh wallet and acted. More fool me.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:59:55
Like you I am in a similar position with funds on the exchange.
Unfortunately, as with the risk from the start, the funds are not in our control.
Who knows who has access to them now, but whoever does I would be surprised if we would be compensated for our losses :-(
