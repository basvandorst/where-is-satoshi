Every human being that still uses that shit service deserves what happens or WILL happen to them. Does no one remember what happened six months ago? 
@_date: 2012-01-06 00:21:08
The correct term for what happened to you is, "You got goxed."

This joker is live on 
He's like the VP of emails or something. Mark won't answer any questions.

You or I would think that, if we were trying to build a normal profitable and reliable business. Thats what makes me worried, with their bestbuy attitude - high prices, fuck service.
It's shit like this mtgox.

Mtgox account claims.

Hopefully enough to cover the accounts he seems to be short.

What do you expect when you put your money in trust of guys who used to trade Magic the Gathering cards...
If the 2 previous DDOS attacks doesn't scare people, then the shitton of "I got HACKED" posts should have. 
**DONT USE MTGOX UNTIL THEY GET SERIOUS ABOUT SECURITY**

If you dont mind, and after typing this I'm sure you'll say no, but what was your balance (vaguely even?)
Also would you mind posting your applicaton time? I was 6/21 around 17:00 GMT
@_date: 2011-06-17 18:10:37
The only thing I can think of is stop using their overpriced shitty unsecure service, but then again no other exchange has as much volatilty. Lets say everyone moved to tradehill, perhaps they would become a better day trading platform.
Lets say you have a lot of coinage. I moved alot of coins from mtcocks (normal pool) when they started getting hacked and ddos'ed and saw the price rise $1 USD literally 2 seconds after I initiated the transfer. TL;DR - Manipulate the market
Start your own exchange. If only, amirite.
Just wait untill they get fully compromised and they go away. This isn't a comic book convention, there are hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake, in which they aren't investing dogdick into the site, so wheres the 1.3% going? Into their pockets so they can run when the site melts down.
@_date: 2011-06-20 02:39:42
And you believe this...

The salt was added after the fact on md5'ed passwords because they didn't have any idea what the fuck they were doing.

Cool story, bro

Some call it paranioa, I call it realism. I'm thinking all of his darkpool buddies are getting accepted, because he needs to raise the capital to pay us back.
I don't think he has the money/btc to pay us.
@_date: 2011-06-24 02:29:45
I just looked up gmt time lol, its 2:28. Yours got denied. Seems like a batch deny.
@_date: 2011-06-22 16:07:18
This is so fucking ridiculous. Even if we get "recovery" of our acounts, we still most likely wont be able to access our money or btc.
This piece of trash is lucky he's not living in the US.
@_date: 2011-06-21 00:10:40
It's funny how no one questions the guy who single handedly almost fucked over tens of thousands of people for millions of dollars.
He's been covering his ass.
An Auditor? Fucking liar - blames someone else for his pathetic mistake.
Ohh this Kevin knew about the attack cause he placed an order 12 FUCKING MINUTES after the massive sell went through? Myself and IMHO thousands were trying to do the same thing if you were watching it live like I was, but the site went into sqlfuck mode. He got lucky, that is if you believe his "logs." Maybe someone can audit that.
IMMA GET THE FBI ON YOU - Fucking asshat lives and is incorporated in Japan. FBI gives fuckall about your fucking problems and would laugh you out of town if you stuck to the auditor routine.
Mark is a cancer. Bitcon will never be stable with him operating an exchange. Blame everyone and accept no responsibilty.
@_date: 2011-06-24 03:21:55
Sweet new troll account. Mine's cooler.
@_date: 2011-06-16 16:11:56


This post seems pretty close to a possible compromise of mtgox.
You won't hear about a real attack until its too late. No one with this information is going to go about willy-nilly saying "Do this and steal bitcoins." I'm not talking about xss or csfr. Real white hats trying to pen-test mtgox are few and far between, those are the only people who would contact mtgox about a vunerability.


That in itself is a HUGE red flag.

Jesus I've been trying to post this for an hour and it keeps getting deleted. Thank you for posting this. Here's his other post with comments - 
[Here's where he posted it in another thread](
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:21:12
Alot of others have too, I just decided to be the mouthiest and rudest to try to get across to more people.
I've been around a while, and yes, its a throwaway account. No one was listening to anyone about a possible compromise. One of the first signs of an oncoming attack is a DDOS to cover the attacker's tracks. That coupled with the fact that no one at mtgox was doing or saying anything about it was another red flag. You can see they were running scared, simply by the was that some passwords weren't salted, and I'm sure ALL of them weren't last week The were adding the salt after the fact, seeing as the salt is listed in the db.
I'm not a i-told-you-so guy, I just want to make sure after tonight there won't be a "business as usual" attitude by current/former mtgox users.

Redditor [imperi]( and I recieved our denials with a 5-10 minute window.

Sorry for your loss, but alas another one to put on the pile. 
People, stop using mtgox. Seriously. You could be next. Do not keep your cash there, transfer your money, buy coins, then immediately transfer them to your wallet. Want to sell? Transfer your coins out of your wallet, sell them, and move your cash to dwolla. Hit these motherfuckers where it hurts until they figure out what the fuck their problem is.
You're all trusting a bunch of guys who used to trade Magic the Gathering cards with MILLIONS of dollars, and they make hundreds of thousands in commission, with a site that looks like it was coded by a 12 yeard old with laughable security measures.
Maybe we should be petitioning MTCOCKS to replace lost users bitcoins out of the **RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF FEES THEY CHARGE**.

As far as we know, no, but we'll never know unless they publish a certification from a reputable 3rd party source in this regard.
I know they're running django as a platform with a anti csrf token plugin. No idea about sql injection.
My advice to anyone trading is the same advice I gave for mtgox - from a US standpoint - get your money to dwolla, immediately transfer money to the exchange when you want to purchase btc. Buy the btc and immediately transfer those btc to your wallet. Want to sell? Transfer the btc to tradehill, sell, and immediately transfer your cash back to dwolla. It mitigates your risk considerably, but there will always be a chance that you will lose them to a fucked up dipshit exchange. Do not let any "exchange" hold your money or btc, for longer than it takes to complete a transaction, ever. 
Sadly, the days of daytrading on volume are over. No one can be trusted.
It seems I'll be creating another account, "tradehell" lol.
