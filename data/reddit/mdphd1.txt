I purchased both, Ledge and Trezor. the ledger install did not go through..Trezor was a breeze...just another data point.

You have to consider, not everyone is as smart as you.

What is crypto...you are overbought if not all BTC

Bitcoin is risky, but if you are willing to take the risk aim to invest an amount that will be life changing, if your bet is correct. It would be unfortunate if you are right, but have a very low amount invested in BTC to make a meaningful difference. I dont buy the story that 0.1 BTC is going to be enough, maybe 1 BTC, more like 10 BTC and above.

Sorry, did not work for me, and support is kind of iffy. Might be good for those with IT experience.

CB is greedy, but the fees at Kraken and Gemini are even higher.

Not your keys, not your coins

Bank wires are transferred on the same day..or you could transfer and keep some money in your acct.

use CoinbasePro, cheaper and better than Coinbase. Once the acct is opened, buy a Trezor and move the money there. Let Coinbase keep track of your transactions.

The video is garbage. How much to hold, depends on your finances, risk tolerance, age etc.
BTC is a bet, you can win the bet, but still lose if you hold too little. I would suggest a minimum of 10 BTC for those living in western countries and a 10 year time horizon. 1 BTC with a 30-40 year time horizon.
