Balaji Srinivasan, General Partner at storied venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz said “Crash or no crash, we should expect a significant increase in the level of institutional adoption this year.

The best part was the [GAW forum reaction]( I can't tell you how much I wish I was not banned from it. If anyone has credentials, please reply to that thread :)
