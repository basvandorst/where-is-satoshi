I guess we would do whatever is legal.  If we are trading with the wholesaler using Bitcoins (or any other bartering mechanism) does government even have legal grounds to do anything about it?  I simply don't even know.
@_date: 2013-03-16 20:53:33
yeah ...I'm trying to wrap my head around the latter too.  It would fall under bartering I think. no?
@_date: 2013-03-16 18:01:11
Yes.  Maybe the wholesalers need some sort of incentive. Maybe the push needs to come from the retailers.  We need to start asking them to accept bc payment.
@_date: 2013-03-21 08:53:46
Yes you could do that, but with a decentralized currency, people might be paid in BTC (or whatever).  I think I read on this sub the other day that there is already a company in Europe that is experimenting with this.
It becomes a nightmare for government to collect the correct income tax when salaries are unknown and anonymous.  Greece is having a similar problem right now because so many people trade in cash.
@_date: 2013-03-19 21:55:08
Are you suggesting we break the law?  How could you ever sell your company if your books were not absolutely transparent and above board?
@_date: 2013-03-16 17:24:49
It's interesting, and certainly solves the cashflow issue, to an extent, but I still believe this thing will only truly explode once the wholesalers come on board.
It presents some very interesting and controversial tax implications for a business like ours.  I don't even know how to wrap my head around it.
Our actual book of accounts would not reflect any Bitcoin activity.  The implications would be insane.

At the moment, the simplest way to do it is to use bitpay.  Great idea, except it's quite a bit more expensive to us than the credit card charges.  Which is understandable, as VISA and MC work off such huge volume..but , right now, we would have to lose money by selling in BTC. 
If we take the coins directly...well, that gets very complicated very quickly.  Most countries outside the US use VAT. We have to "buy" the BTC from the customer in a sense(excl VAT), but when we want to sell them we have to add VAT back on.  Which means nobody will buy them.
The wholesalers are not using BTC yet either, so we HAVE to sell the coins and convert to cash before we can buy more stock.  Cash flow is already the biggest nightmare we struggle with.  BTC would make that worse.
Edit: The charge-back advantage you mention is more of a benefit to companies that have shit customer service.  Our only charge-backs come from fraud issues with stolen cards.  We've stamped that out now and have virtually no charge-backs.  Personally, the charge-back thing is a non issue when considering BTC.

If a decentralized currency ever took off, governments would have to re-invent the way they do taxes.
Maybe ALL tax would end up becoming sales tax.  A can of coke would be 5 dollars.
@_date: 2013-03-16 22:06:48
Okay, it might be the same where I live, I'll have to look into it.
If it is, it's incredibly easy to hide/fudge and mislead with a completely anonymous bartering system.
Say I ship in 1000 blankets from India. I can pay the wholesaler a small fee in actual currency, and the rest in bc.  Government would not be able to find out about the bc payment.  I will only get taxed a small amount on the very small foreign exchange portion.
Not saying I would do this....just trying to understand how industry will operate in the future.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:28:32
Number 3 is the biggest one.
BTC has real value. In fact, I would argue that it has greater intrinsic value than gold because, among other things, you can spend it easily.
Every shop that starts trading in BTC raises it's intrinsic value.  Can you imagine how the price would sky-rocket if Amazon came on board?
Conversely, it's value is completely obliterated if government banned any online shop from trading in it.
@_date: 2013-03-19 11:54:03
What's the benefit of something being decentralized if it can be regulated?
@_date: 2013-04-02 09:07:43
It just makes me doubt the credibility of any one of these talking heads.
All confidence...no intelligence.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:36:01
I take the implosion of the dollar and other currencies very seriously.
@_date: 2013-03-16 19:33:11
Do you do that on a website? if so...can you link us? I want to see how you integrate it into your shopfront.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:05:39
Are you converting straight to currency before it reaches you, or do you actually have a Bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2013-03-16 17:45:20
BitPay is certainly interesting.  I will have to look at their charges and run some models to see if it makes sense for our business.
The no charge-back issue is quite nice but, to be honest, we've only had about $1500 worth of charge-backs over the past year.
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:05:26
All governments would be threatened by it...ESPECIALLY China.
Think of a a company that trades only in BTC.  There is no sales tax, no income tax for their employees, import and export tax can easily be subverted.  It changes everything, and I cannot imagine any government, that is currently functioning, being okay with that.
@_date: 2013-09-07 21:30:29
...but it's so easy to get around import duties like that.  With btc being anonymous, you can get them to invoice you for 1 coin but you pay them 10.  Customs only see a currency conversion for 1 coin.
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:50:41
This is where it gets tricky though.
When the retailer needs to pay other companies in BTC, they are doing so before it get converted into dollars. It's completely off the books.
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:45:43
You may be right, but I'm not a martyr.  Someone else can do the jail time for tax evasion.
I still believe in bitCoin, and believe it could be huge one day, but I'm going to be using it very carefully and transparently in my business.
@_date: 2013-03-23 10:10:33
As a retailer who would like to trade in BTC, we need to find out how we are going to make this viable for us first.  It's not as easy as you think because the wholesalers are not on board yet. So there are BTC/currency conversions which make things cumbersome or expensive  or both.
There's also the issue of VAT in European countries.  That gets very interesting and complicated....and might even mean that it will never really work at all in countries that use VAT.
Edit: Also the legal grey area of whether or not you are breaking some tax evasion law.  End users, such as yourself are not doing anything illegal, but the retailers might be doing jail time if they are not careful.
@_date: 2013-04-17 11:10:42
Good to know, but it's easy enough for any business to accept bitcoins directly too.
@_date: 2013-04-17 14:34:20
The amount of tax you charge must be difficult to work out.
If you list something for 1BTC and do not list a dollar amount, then who's to say how much sales tax should be charged for it.
(I'm not American, I use VAT, but I'm assuming sales tax is a percentage of the sale..right?)
Edit: I just looked at your site and see that you do not list Dollars at all.  So you work out tax at the current Currency rate.  Is that at the time of purchase? or when you sell the BTC?
@_date: 2013-06-20 09:26:23
Sorry.  It's a hell of thing to put your business,your livelihood and the lives of your staff at risk like that.  Someone more successful and more powerful than me can take these banks to court over this kind of behavior.  Hopefully they can make a difference.
@_date: 2013-03-16 17:20:45
Thanks, I'll look into it.
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:18:15
Wow, I see it the other way around.  I don't think there is enough of an understanding from customers as to how much more expensive and complex trading in BTC is for the companies.
I'm trying to figure out how to do it for my company at the moment, but it's not looking good so far.
@_date: 2013-03-21 12:02:25
How are you guys buying bitcoin in SA at the moment.
mtGox does not accept Rands....as far as I know.
@_date: 2013-07-27 19:28:02
Yeah, self education via podcasts, and the internet in general, is the way to go.  You've just got to be careful not to spend too much time in any one place.  Subscribe to for a month and then replace it with and see how it changes your opinion of what's going on.  
I'm so hyper aware of how easy I'm am to influence, that I'm no longer easy to influence.  If that makes sense.
@_date: 2013-09-07 21:01:27
How are you going to show your import invoice to customs?
How will customs work out the duties?
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:38:17
Yes but theadvenger makes a good point.  You would have to have a different tax for agricultural land.  The land is integrally tied into the business of the farm. It would be different from residential tax.  The land is an asset of the business. It would be unfair to tax that asset if you could not tax the assets of any other business.
@_date: 2013-07-27 14:34:13
I don't know, I'm not American.  
It sounds like Fox is corrupt as hell though. If I lived in the US I would not take RT or Fox very seriously.
We do get CNN though.  It's boring as hell and seems to just be fluff.
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:45:18
For now, that might be the case, but if this becomes a true world wide currency it needs to be more stable than the dollar.
@_date: 2013-07-27 12:52:19
It's astounding how few people have worked this out.
RT is backed by Putin's regime, and it's entire objective is to undermine the west.  If RT started criticizing the totalitarian(anti-libertarian) elements within Russia, they would be shut down immediately.
@_date: 2013-07-25 07:04:37
With Paypals experience they could probably start up something like bitpay and be very competitive.
@_date: 2013-04-05 07:19:04
So you are accepting coins directly then.  How do you manage your cashflow?  Do you convert the coins into cash, or have you found suppliers that are accepting BTC?
@_date: 2013-03-19 21:01:44
haha...it might sound that way, but it freaks me out to be honest.  The complexity of what it's going to do to my company if we start trading in btc is just overwhelming.
@_date: 2013-09-07 21:44:30
Natanael_L was saying that the invoice that customs sees is in dollars.  A conversion at time of trade.
@_date: 2013-06-20 07:21:16
Someone is going to have to tackle this in court and set a precedent.  If not, then vendors like myself are simply not going to trade in BTC I'm afraid.  It's just too much risk for my business.  I know this probably pisses a lot of people off but (on top of my own interests), I have a lot of staff members who rely on me for their income. I can't be playing around with peoples lives simply because I have an interest in BTC.  I'm out for now.
@_date: 2013-03-17 07:27:39
Interesting, but that's more expensive than our cc charges...which are 1.98%
@_date: 2013-10-11 11:41:16
As a vendor, I wish more wholesalers around the world accepted btc.
Once the wholesalers are onboard, the vendors will follow.
@_date: 2013-03-19 21:17:31
It's going to require adoption from the complete supply chain.  Manufacturer, Distributor, Re-seller. 
Right now, everyone is putting the pressure on the re-seller, but they need to start placing pressure on the wholesaler.
@_date: 2013-07-27 16:08:21
Yeah, but all of this is old news.  Noam Chomsky has been talking about this stuff for decades.
The point is that RT is every bit as bad as all of all of them.  The unbridled(almost childlike) nationalism of RT just makes their attempt at "manufacturing opinions" more transparent and obvious than FOX/CNN...but they're all, ultimately, just as bad.
I have more experience with the UNBELIEVABLE corruption and bullshit that happens in Russia than I do with America(never been to the US).... So I find RT a bit more laughable than you guys do.
