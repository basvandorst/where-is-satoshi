I understand that the times change, and sometimes the sanest geopolitical scientists can do nothing about human stupidity. And trump's election will be a HUGE chapter in polisci in 5 years, he's not just a new president. ANYWAY. That being said. Ancient political theory and bitcoin/crypto is still the opposite of compatible in my opinion. Like, not at all applicable.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:47:46
never said it was. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:04:34
Yeah that's very much a "duh" comment but still have no clue how it applies. Kings fall, trees die, Game of Thrones had kings = bitcoin won't be the remaining cryptoasset?
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:47:09
I too remember history with dragons and ice zombies, not to mention that just because a poly-sci professor is a fan of GOT and can warp it to fit a perspective doesn't make it a viable source of information about the world at large.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:18:47
trump is president bro, your articles are 6 years old
edit: from one of your articles lol "On the other hand, I’m just not sure how much the world of Westeros translates into modern world politics."
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:48:56
Lol, cause game of thrones is an accurate prediction of the "natural" way of things amirite
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:17:36
y'all forget that forest was one rich motherfucker worth bajillions
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:14:20
lol. 60 days ago and that was an ATH
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:04:42
it's a flawed system and we were all screwed from the get-go, whether there was crypto or not. If anything, it might be a saving grace cause it will be a backbone for a new way of doing things rather than having the economy collapse with nothing else to offer as an alternative except for the barter system.
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:07:21
I'm not saying bitcoin is the saving grace for the problems in America, but I also don't see how having the economy backed by debt is in any way safe/sane in the long run.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:25:43
piss off butthurt excoiner
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:28:57
Ah well, I can't answer that cause I'm not that smart, but I'd love to hear an honest / intelligent response to this.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:07:51
the world runs on the promise that you'll keep working to pay your debts. it's our raison d' etre, as sad as that is, to keep the status quo for the sake of the status quo
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:08:54
lol get the fuck out of here. your ignorance is stifling
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:16:19
we assign value to everything.
and money isn't real bro, we make it real.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:19:50
with popularity / growing user base / legitimacy it too will come with regulations, it's inevitable.
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:04:56
how are they good if they're pieces of shit
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:08:00
"1. normal ponzi got central company, the central company can run away with your money anytime
- bitcoin dont have central, all peer to peer, no central company that can run away
2. normal ponzi promises you return such as 10% return per month
- bitcoin never promises you any return
3. normal ponzi product is unlimited
- bitcoin is limited
4. normal ponzi product is not useful
- bitcoin is very useful for you to transfer money from one country to another
5. normal ponzi will collapse once no newcomers join the party
- bitcoin will not collapse even if no newcomers join, the oldtimers can still use them just that the price wont go up anymore"
you automatically lose any credit when you think everyone that's in bitcoin is here to profit. the goal is different, and you just don't get it.
have a good day ignoramus
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:29:02
are you gonna buy a house, or a car? start a business? that's all debt. and you're gonna work to pay it off.
95% of people are too scared to consider what would happen if they stopped paying their bills, so they work. that fear of falling behind is, in my opinion, many people's reason for doing what they do. same thing for countries.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:05:38
I'm not arguing whether it's good or bad, just saying that to be in debt, or to accumulate it is almost like a new natural state for our world.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:42:46
read the news and the lines between it, be smart
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:54:00
this man smarts

shouldn't have bought a house you couldn't afford bruh. the american dream ain't cheap in the eyes of the rest of the world
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:21:12
yeah, the internet/email/browsing was pretty hard to use by normies 20 years ago too btw. give it time dude jeez
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:53:13
mm mm mm nonono
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:20:09
which ones? explain why, please.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:39:24
sure pal
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:00:56
every single government in the world runs on debt. it's the global economy. IOUOMEOU

geia s re 8hrio
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:14:53
bro if you're uninformed and can't grasp the fact that the news cycle is scaring off new investors with shitposts as a reaction to the government/banking system's backlash against crypto then wtf are you doing here
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:35:29
that's what we all get for letting it run amok for so long. we have the power yet seldom use it.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:59:33
holy shit. he put that much in at the ATH? that's tragic. and stupid. but tragic.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:16:39
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:57:56
get off your "anti-troll" high horse bub
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:58:56
if you're a fucking soothsayer sure. the safest bet is to just hodl
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:59:54
lol gtfo
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:22:23
that's sorta what all the altcoins are? Bitcoin is almost a reserve for cryptocurrencies in a way.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:52:54
the fact you call it a ponzi scheme makes it blatantly obvious you have no idea what bitcoin is
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:08:53
lol dream on bro
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:56:02
so your money is up your asshole?

wow are you serious? people actually did that? lololol WOW
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:39:10
yeah, exactly. he was worth more even when he stopped running.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:20:50
Actually they could just charge transaction fees for every reimbursed payment. But yeah I'm pretty sure some things will always stay the same. There were banks and loans before fiat, there'll be banks and loans in the potential crypto-future too.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:38:07
time will tell bub. at least I'm staying positive, and by putting money into it that's literally my bet, my gamble, that it does stick around.
and in 5 years we'll have a waaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy better infrastructure for crypto, governments / companies will have some shit together, and the market will be more stable. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:43:21
that is bleak as all hell my dude, thanks for taking the time to enlighten me. I'm gonna take a few hours and re-evaluate everything.
thankfully I DO know an asian language lol.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:29:25
dunno it looks to me as if the economy is purely backed by the fact that it is owed money. there is absolutely nothing to keep it going except for the paranoia it breeds in people. If everyone stopped paying their debts the economy collapsed. And so society is constantly engineered to keep people afraid and complacent to keep working the jobs the hate to pay off the debts they owe because they were told they needed a house and a 2 cars and three tvs to feel happy.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:15:59
lol can't wait to see your face in the next five years when the butthurt really sets in.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:21:42
if ANYTHING, ETH will be the "silver" to bitcoin's "gold"
aside from the fact that it's centralised, and therefore null as a concept, the ICO scams are pretty offputting imo
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:59:41
check the links smartboy
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:50:32
-60% of an ATH which was speculative at best and not reflective of actual market worth*
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:54:25
we live in the age of technology and instant information, yet here you are not being able to do research and make a side-by-side comparison
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:11:19
lol I ain't mad, I spent what I could afford and got in early.
I'm just sad people like you spread cancer and damage the community and diminish the reputation through your ignorance on the tech.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:44:29
I'm sure exchanges might start to take on financing roles, or new entities that are "crypto" rich will begin financing etc. It's not that big of a stretch for the imagination, almost like your local loan company that isn't a bank.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:40:36
centralised, kid
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:53:06
how is it not decentralised
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:33:23
it was still too young to be adopted by the mainstream. in my eyes this is a growing pain.
tbh if you're using credit to essentially gamble then those people, and their money, is what added to the volatility. this whole thing is like a cruise ship that's being built as it sails. sure it's fine when crazy people buy the best wood and materials for a few months to help because they fell for Ahab's rhetoric, but when their weak belief system causes them to snap and jump ship, it's actually a boon to the vessel.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:12:19
we've all got different moons and different reasons to hodl. was never in this to profit, or waste my time daytrading.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:10:26
that's a flawed thought process you have then. they are not the same. the goal is to become the same, but at this point it's still maturing
