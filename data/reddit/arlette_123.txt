Okay, thank you. Ultimatley wouldn't I have to link my bank account sooner or later? Im just afraid Im going to try and buy with my card and my bank will make a big deal out of it.
Thank you.

can mobile wallets and desktop wallets be linked or a wallet on mobile is completely separate? are mobile wallets only for small amounts of bitcoin? Thank you.

the only thing is i reached my limit for my card and could buy more if i added my bank account. I dont know what else to do.

@_date: 2017-12-20 09:42:51
Okay so basically as long as i am under that i should use  a hardware wallet? I assume the same applies for Gemini?
Thank you.

Which are you thinking, ethereum or litecoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:09:48
Would it be a good idea to transfer my ETH and LTC to binance and conintue to buy ETH and LTC from Coinbase? I like how binance has a whole bunch of other currencies that you can keep all in one spot. 
thank you

What other wallet do you use other than your phone? Would cold storage be considered Trezor? Something i have to order? Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:59:45
I feel this way too, but it makes me nervous seeing so many people saying to put it in a wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:14:16
ok thank you
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:30:00
Thank you.

I am also using coinbase and would like to use my actual bank account instead of a card. Would you recommend using card or linking my account directly even though it will take a bit longer.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:11:30
weird, i type binance in my google search and it goes right to the site.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:50:27
thats a good idea thank you
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:27:34
Would you recommend a desktop wallet like the above mentions, electrum? They can get hacked no? I have a mac.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:34:16
i posted asking because a trans fee to go to my wallet was 17 dollars lol I'm a newbie and was asking is it was normal for it to be that high
