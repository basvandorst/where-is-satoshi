I will kneel on a towel at 6 in the morning, face the moon and chant "Sastochi Akbar".
When I walk out of the bank after closing my accounts "SASTOCHI AKBAR!"
I will not touch USD as it is dirty and unclean.
If i convert all currency to bitcoin Sastochi will reward me with 42 Altcoins.
I will post further comments such as this on bitcoincirclejerk or something similar :p
