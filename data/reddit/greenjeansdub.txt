Until we see them drop to a reasonable % this should be everybody's main/only concern.

Volume is up..this seems legit. Possibly all the positive news.. and some new holiday growth. I dont think this recent growth spurt has anything to do with China. Thoughts.?

I think all these points are great.. but just a thought. (Devils advocate)
First of all let me state I own and condone/support what this process is.
Coincidence that coins on the open market are getting third party grading (anacs) and selling for a premium?  Government feels robbed. Mike gets a c-n-d. 
Simple. And wrong, but the gov. Does not like to be beat at thier own game.
This was my first thought as a holder, investor, coin collector, and spender.

Why not just "mint" denominations of bc in coin form and "sell them".
Ask Mike.
Its a shame.
