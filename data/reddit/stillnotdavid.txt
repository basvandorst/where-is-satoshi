now hopefully everyone on this sub goes to gemini so maybe coinbase's network can be less congested next time

realism is not appreciated here

thats literally the bitcoin app for noobs, are you sure you're even a noob yet, noob?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:26:17
everyone is mad that their bitcoin dropped 7% after BCH's release on coinbase, apparently
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:16
you guys spam HODL until its time to actually hodl like seriously why does it matter if you're holding anyways 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:17:22
you're also forgetting that BTC increased like 800000% in the last few years too

This sub has always been this
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:52:08
so the site could crash when they announce it instead of when it launches? then you people would be crying that they crashed their own servers before BCH went live and no one can buy or sell it in time

i like gdax

It's a whole two weeks of rising.

It absolutely cannot shoot straight up to 10k, but whether or not it will crash from now until the fork is a mystery. If you sell now you may miss out on quite a lot if it hits 8.5k at the fork, for example.

same here, i sold at 6.4k because i expected it to drop 400-500 as its been doing, but it ended up soaring
