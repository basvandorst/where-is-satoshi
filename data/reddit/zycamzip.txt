When is the next split scheduled to happen?

Buy as much as you can afford, weekly or bi-weekly. When you can afford it, move either to your own wallet or btcpop. Coinbase does some shady shit with your coins when they hold it. There were 2 splits already, and coinbase users lost out on them.

Bitcoin is dead, long live Bitcoin!

It will likely play choppy while people buy/sell on peaks, like it did at 3k. So you can buy when it dips again.

The only thing Coinbase has been good for, was transferring money from my bank account to bitcoin. I don't even leave my money in a their wallet.

much prefer transparent png files, but meh. Guess I will have to do it manually.

You don't have to use Coinbase, there are alternatives. You have to make up your own mind about when to move it out. All I can say, is buy weekly or bi-weekly, whatever you can afford. Then move to your own wallet, btcpop, or any other site you trust.

Back when bitcoin was $1500, i tried to do that with my 401k. Sadly, its locked in.

Personally, right now, I am leaving mine on btcpop. But really it depends on what you want to do. 
 
There are hardware wallets, paper wallets, and online wallets. There was a time where I was burning up hard drives, and am personally not a fan of them. Others have theirs on secure usb drives, all I can think of with these, is too much damage, or someone mugging you (and recognizing what they look like) and losing them. Even paper wallets are dangerous, but likely the safest of them all, for portability.
 
Then there are the online wallets. None of them are government backed, so you are at the mercy of the websites. Some have left with the money. Coinbase... really shouldn't be trusted, considering they haven't given the btcc. But then, none of the companies who didn't give you the btcc should be trusted... btcpop has my money sitting in an interest bearing account, and I got my btcc. This is the ONLY online wallet I trust at this time. They also exchange most other crypto currencies.
But please remember, whatever you do... this is my personal opinions based on what I have read and seen.

And THAT is why I never got a Trezor. Lose the Trezor, and you're fucked. Damage the Trezor and you're fucked. Forget or lose the pin and pass phrase... you're fucked. Something happens to you, and your family is fucked.
At one point I was burning up hard drives monthly, lost some important data. No wallet for me at home.
Online wallet for me, password saved in a pw manager (40 some odd numbers and characters). Obviously not coinbase tho, lol.

kek!

So which wallets are not Segwit2x, just so I don't lose my investment. Luckily I was able to move my coin to a site which supported the last split, otherwise would not have any cash as well.

Supposedly, coinbase is going to give you the btcc around January 1st. But you can transfer the rest off now, before the next hard fork. Then they will give it still, if the actually do anyways. Its a wait and see moment now with coinbase.

I haven't used a check in years. I moved (in the US), and suddenly need checks. My landlord wants a check, my drycleaner wants a check, even the gas (petrol) station charges a fee for a debit card. I think its been around 8vyears since I needed to use a check.
Guess what the bank said... no free checks. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:05:32
coinbase still hasn't given away the bitcoin cash to their users. I would recommend btcpop.co. You can't transfer money to/from your bank, but you can exchange for all other crypto currencies. Additional I instantly received the btcc. Right now, I am earning 3% back on my balance. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:51:30
Dammit, when is the hardfork happening? I just pulled from another wallet to deposit in coinbase. Back to btcpop i guess. Got my btcash immediately on that split with btcpop.

Already moved my money out of Coinbase in anticipation.
But the reason it finally hit $5k, is someone fucked up on their automated algorithm, and forgot to sell.

At some point, banks are going to adopt bitcoin by buying as much as possible, and selling little of it. When they control the majority, its going to skyrocket.

You're trying to use US law on an international currency, which the US government doesn't recognize?

I was thinking if he linked the code, doing the same thing.

I used to play at the upstairs bar in Fitzgeralds. Get a 151 and coke while playing, comped. When they switched over, wanted $7. Nope. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:03:26
Last year, I needed $400. Pulled out, left like $7 in it. Bitcoin was trading at the time at around $400-$600. Now? Now, I am trying to put a little bit in, and there is a freaking hold, because where I live takes a while to get the money in. So $400 1 year ago, would be $1500+ now. If I could yank out my 401k and put it in, or better yet, invest like 25% of it in, I would. Last thing I want to do not, is pull money out. But Bully for you!

Apparently Red Dragon Casino also has one. Its off of W Sahara near LV Blvd.
