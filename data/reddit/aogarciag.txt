Man, the dip will bring BTC to 10K.

0.2%

Have you tried to get psychological advice? You should go on and be confident that if you made that amount of money once then you can make it once again. 2018 seems like the year for Crypto and specially altcoins. You can do it and exit at the right time

That's the most logical decision. Good luck bro!

People are crying for just a 20% fall from 7,500 usd. We all knew a correction was coming. But the market is always stupid and people buy the pump lol.

We must understand that we’re not the big players in this. One day it will be all over and we must be prepared to detect when to exit.
Now not but this is a lesson for the future

I also think that the dip will be huge. It’s not possible for the segwit2x futures to trade at 2,000 and still btc at 7,000+. 
This growth is not natural and historically huge dips come during the weekends. Don’t get me wrong, btc will still go higher and higher at the long run but this week was insane.

Your algorithm uses TA indicators?
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:03:31
It will go down as people will start liquidating their positions for their daily expenses.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:22:34
I agree, TA fails most of the time. It has almost no predictive power

No way. This dip is daytraders fun, it's like a poker game that tests your resistance whenever they show you a big red dildo

Waiting for a bigger dump before buying

Nothing but not taking profits has cost more than 30k
