That's your specific situation. Not everyone lives where you do. You don't have to tell me how cheap (or not cheap) it is. I can see their price listed on their site. 
It isn't just about cost either. It's about convenience.

I've been wanting to try this for a while. I'd go as far as giving it a full week at first to start out. 
All of the naysayers in this thread need to think about what people are eating now. Hasn't the food industry already re-invented what food is? Is it even food anymore? How is this any worse? At least it is attempting to get a low cost, complete nutrition out there.

One could argue that what your family is eating isn't as nutritious as Soylent which may justify the cost.

That's a matter of opinion and you're certainly entitled to it. You're also suggesting that people buy computers based on hardware alone. Not on OS or applications supported by that OS. Hell, if what you were arguing were true, we wouldn't have an issue with Apple right now. It doesn't run an app that we want so we have to use a different OS. They're basically the same hardware underneath right? So what's the difference? The OS and the apps that they run.

I doubt that's a real worry in this specific situation. I don't think the government would have a hard time keeping this method under control.

@_date: 2013-07-19 06:15:00
The reliability of their site has absolutely nothing to do with their trustworthiness. Yes, they're going through growing pains right now but damn.. Give them a break.

@_date: 2013-11-05 18:12:20
As much as I love Bitcoin I don't think it could beat the speed of Square in this instance. Most people have credit/debit cards. Most people do not have Bitcoin in their possession ready to spend/send. It would take much longer to verify a bank account and wait for coins to arrive at Coinbase (arguably the easiest way to buy coins) than to send an email and enter in your card details.
It's unlikely that someone would start with neither but if that were the case I guess getting on localbitcoins and trading cash for BTC would be faster than going in to set up a bank account. 
Edit: If someone were to start with *both* then I agree that Bitcoin would win. Confirmations take much less than a full 24hrs to finish.

I do feel like I've lost nothing because I have more than I started out with. I'm not sure how else to measure it besides that. Anything I make with the miner (however small) is even more than I started out with.

Chances are you'll *never* make a profit by mining. At this point it takes a considerable investment up front for there to be any chance of profit which it doesn't sound like you have. 
It doesn't use much bandwidth but it helps to have a very low latency connection. 
Technically you only need a working computer to mine. Everyone here will tell you not to mine and they have good reasons to. For example, if you're CPU or GPU mining it will take a *very* long time to make even the smallest amount of BTC. Even then you'll pay more for electricity powering your computer than you'd make in BTC. 
Mining and BTC aren't a get rich quick scheme.
@_date: 2013-11-15 10:21:40
If people are worried about up time they should just configure their mining software for failover. It isn't hard. The effort it takes to configure multiple pools in bfgminer is worth it.

I switched to Keepass recently (open source, keep your database anywhere you want) and it's been great. I keep it synced/backed up on Google Drive. It has some built in password generators for 128/256 bit passwords and you can make new profiles that have options to include upper, lower, digits, and special characters AND set a specific number of characters. If you're using lastpass you can actually export your passwords and import them into Keepass.

You don't necessarily need to use the Qt wallet. If you have the HDD space (11-12 GBs now I think) then it's nice to run a full node (ie: you have a full copy of the blockchain) but you don't have to. There are "lite" wallets like Electrum or Multibit that use servers to host a full copy of the blockchain so you don't have to. You still control all of your own private keys so there's no extra risk when compared to the Qt wallet. 
What meant by "Don't trust anybody. Be your own bank !!!" was that you shouldn't place your coins in an online wallet or exchange (coinbase, mtgox, bitstamp, ect.) because these sites have been getting "hacked" (or the owner runs off with the coins) and there's nothing you can do about it. When choosing a wallet really all you need to consider in terms of security is "am I the only one with access to my private keys?"

Here's the blockchain link:
In case anyone was searching this with the same problem, here's now I fixed it. One of two things could have been causing it. There could have been a bug in the wallet that I'm using (Electrum 1.9 at the time of the post and 1.9.4 at the time of this comment). OR it could have been Avast (which I only recently installed) blocking certain ports on my computer causing issues. SO.. Check your wallet to make sure it's up to date and make sure you don't have any anti-virus or firewalls blocking ports you need.

I don't really know what you're talking about here. A block is just a record of transactions. It doesn't really *do* anything. 


They can encrypt my whole computer if they like. I have my seed saved offline. I'll re-image, re-install, and restore my wallet. This also wouldn't affect paper wallets or people who store their coins on a computer that stays offline. 


That's what's great about the open source aspect of it. It's been open for everyone to see for years now. Even if there were some enormous vulnerability that has been overlooked, it could be fixed. It would probably damage peoples trust in it, sure, but it could be fixed.

They should build something that would allow the transactions to go through immediately and end up in the merchants wallet. They could set a percentage to take then "forward" the coins to the destination address as specified by the merchant.

I was referring to the fact that when a miner finds a block they are rewarded with 25 Bitcoins. When they are all found (21 million of them) no one will be getting rewards for finding blocks since they will have all been found.

This will be the case for me technically. 
I bought a 5GH machine with profits I made from appreciation of the bitcoins I bought last year. I hope to make enough to keep buying more and more power. Might take a while once these start shipping though. 
If I make 0 Bitcoins I still wouldn't have lost anything.
EDIT: Also I don't pay for power.

Storing coins locally doesn't necessarily mean cold storage. It just means that **only you** have the private key to spend those coins.
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:12:18
Okay that makes sense to me. Thanks for the explanation. 
I just don't think the fees will be enough to keep some (maybe most) people mining. I guess it's just a question of if the fees they bring in will be more than the cost of running the machines.

I didn't say government payed for it. They *facilitate* it though. Do you really believe we could have the road system we have today without any kind of organizing body? If it weren't the law to pay taxes we'd have a bunch of people refusing to pay but still using the roads anyway.

I welcome some devil's advocate questions/remarks. 
Most of these arguments can be answered by just saying "for now" as said in the comments.
On the issue of power.. I'd be willing to bet that Bitcoin miners use less power altogether than banks use to run their computers, Visa/Mastercard/Discover use to run their servers, and less than Paypal uses to run theirs. It's distributed anyway. If it becomes too much for any one miner then he stops mining, the difficulty adjusts and we move on.

Individuals will be short sighted and say "this governing body doesn't deserve my hard earned money even if it does support infrastructure. I only use the road once a week! Why should I have to pay?"
A governing body is *tasked* with upkeep like this. It's their responsibility. One of the reasons they exist.

I don't understand what you mean here. You should only store your coins locally. Any amount of coins you have in online wallets you should be ready to lose. Storing coins locally doesn't hamper your ability to use said coins so I'm not sure what you mean.

From the moment I heard about Bitcoin I thought farmers markets would be the perfect place for it.

If I understand it correctly, it only requires analysis of the blockchain to accomplish what's being debated. Miners don't have a say.

@_date: 2013-11-23 00:14:01
You shouldn't keep your coins in a web wallet. Not having them on a web wallet increases security and doesn't hamper your ability to spend/use the coins. (I say it this way because I'm afraid new Bitcoin users have this mentality). 
I encourage you to check out Electrum (or Multibit). All you need to do is save the 12 word seed (you'l know what I mean when you use one if you don't already) and you're safe from losing your coins because of deletion or if your computer craps out. Keep this seed safe because it allows you to re-create all of your public/private keys in the event of device failure (it's a backup). These wallets also allow you to encrypt your wallet so every time you spend coins you need to input your password. As long as you keep the 12 word seed safe, no one will be able to steal your coins. 
@_date: 2013-07-16 13:32:43

This is exactly what I had in mind while reading the thread! I'd pay $20-$30 for that.

If he "fell" for the scam why didn't he just send all of his BTC? Or is it more likely that he was testing it by sending a very low amount? Fucking troll.
