Why? Nobody owns the name 'bitcoin' do they?


This would mean unanimity of agreement of developers though wouldn't it? Also wouldn't this just mean developers have 100% control of the network? In fact isn't even worse than that. wouldn't a single malicious developer be able to stop/control all progress by constant objecting to all software?


But things are always changed and fixed in software. Was bitcoin's original release not 'working code' since it has had to be upgraded over time?


But, doesn't the network itself pay them through the block reward? That isn't really 'you' paying them. That is the network/economy paying them. Yes, you can pay them for specific individual transactions, but this fee can't be used to dictate to the miners anything else other than where you want the transaction to go and how much is being sent.


Do you have a source for that?


But your description of 'rough consensus and working code' allows a single/small group of developers to block/filter anything that gets into the protocol.

Weird how much this got downvoted. Should we not ask these kinds of questions in this community?

So you can't answer a single question? Fair enough. 
I thought these would be pretty straight forward questions to be honest. I am really surprised I haven't got an answer to a single question from anybody yet.

I know what a node does. I'd appreciate it if you could answer a question or two.

I really would appreciate a direct answer to a direct question.
I understand what a node does. How can you know that a node isn't just a sybil attack on the network? How do we know if a node isn't just run by a 'bad guy'?
