How is Coinbase working together with other exchanges? Do you guys discuss security, suspicious users/accounts?
@_date: 2016-04-14 12:15:10
Was thinking the same thing.
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:23:30
So.... wtf am I reading? Western Union is on board the Bitcointrain now? This must be fake 
@_date: 2015-12-02 15:48:36
For B&amp;C,
Nowadays transactions made on exchanges (buy &amp; sell) are not transparent. The user has to trust that the information on trading volume for example, given by the exchange is correct.  
Since both of you work for two major exchanges, do you see any opportunities here to make this more transparent?

Now Ebay is replaced with a decentralized platform Open Bazaar, it's time for a decentralized AirBnB.
Thanks in advance.

Thanks for sharing. I found this address on the website you just shared. 
How is it possible to generate/use a public key like this?

I'm a bit jealous, we don't have Shift card in Europe yet. Would be great if you could show us a video. I agree with you Shift is awesome!
@_date: 2015-12-20 10:18:34
Sounds great. So no worries as long as you have a wallet backup. 
No matter what time it was created if I understand it right.
Thanks again.
@_date: 2015-12-11 21:27:00
Thnx! I'll check this out.

Decentralize the mainstream apps. Some of them are already been taking care of.
* Ebay = Openbazaar
* Facebook = Synereo
* WhatsApp = Signal messenger
* Uber = You can choose this one
* AirBnB = You can choose this one as well

He can marry a Swiss girl, that might work.
@_date: 2015-12-20 08:59:54
Interesting, learned something new. Thanks.
Does this mean that.... If you keep your wallet.dat file as a backup. 
You need to create a new backup file of your wallet.dat after every transaction because a new address is generated?
Or is the new address already in the previous wallet backup file?
Hopefully I explained my question well enough.

There are no signs on the AirBaltic website that you can pay with Bitcoin. But when you checkout you have the option to choose Bitcoin. I purchased my ticket by paying with BTC.  
They use Bitpay and do charge a fee for paying with BTC (5,99 euro).
@_date: 2014-07-20 20:03:10
Well..... just found out that you can buy cheap European plane tickets with Bitcoin here... 
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:31:39
Does that mean the more XCP people buy the less BTC becomes available because it gets burned? 
@_date: 2014-12-22 04:51:58
That's not the only thing what brings the price down. Hackers still got roughly 850K in Bitcoin from Mt. Gox. 
That's around 6.2% of all Bitcoins available right now.
They control the market and they're dumping their coins bit by bit every day.
It's not only inflation.
@_date: 2014-11-04 10:37:25
Thank you sir! I'll tip it on wisely.
@_date: 2014-12-20 12:23:19
Only "in some regions" So.... probably in the US only. Just like Microsoft. :-) 
@_date: 2014-07-22 07:21:53
Just like Kraken.com free SEPA deposits!
@_date: 2014-11-04 06:46:03
Let the tipping begin. Just opened a account. :-)
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:29:07
This is what I'm thinking as well. Hackers stole 850K in Bitcoins and dumping them bit by bit each day at several exchanges. For them it's free money anyway. I wonder how long it takes to cash all their coins. Hopefully they wont buy back in again.
@_date: 2014-10-26 15:50:10
Yeah.... I've got a question, it's been on my mind for a while. Why are 67.5% of all Bitcoins available at this moment, being held by 13890 wallet addresses? 
Maybe it's my lack of knowledge or am I reading it wrong. Could somebody please explain? Thanks in advance.
According to this link: 
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:02:05
Well and this makes the whole system more unreliable than the current financial system that we're using. 
Why don't exchanges/services work with the blockchain? Just put every trade in the blockchain, that would be the only transparent way to prove yourself as an exchange.
@_date: 2014-11-04 05:26:28
This looks great! The AirBitz video shows that it's using Bluetooth to make a transaction. Does that mean that Apple Pay is also using Bluetooth to make a transaction?
I'm afraid (because my lack of tech knowledge) to use any other software/wallets except from bitcoin.org 
AirBitz is not listed there.
@_date: 2014-11-13 02:11:11
Hi Mick,
What is your opinion about Apple Pay? And does Coinbase has any plans to create something similar? NFC payments?
Thank you for doing this AMA!
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:29:59
Can it be done in combination with a sidechain what everyone is talking about? A sidechain for exchanges and services?
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:38:40
Let's get those bits rolling!
@_date: 2014-08-11 08:24:17
You definitely got a point here, we could learn from this. There is a new payment system introduced in Holland and it's called MyOrder. This system has some nice features that could be used in Bitcoin wallets and applications.  
@_date: 2014-11-04 05:06:42
Thanks for your reply.
But it looks like you need a NFC tag or token to use this...
My smartphone supports NFC, why is it not possible to transfer Bitcoins from my android wallet without scanning QR codes?
I would make things lot more easier. :-)
 
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:03:06
Nope, not at all. Just some arbitrage bots doing their job.
@_date: 2015-01-18 11:05:17
At what date will the Winklevoss ETF be launched?
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:46:16
Bitcoin already has a central bank, it's controlled by a group of hackers who stole lots of coins from Gox. Last year they decided the price had to go down.

This is absolutely ridicules no insurance against theft? They are holding 1% of all the Bitcoins right?
It shows that they have no trust in their own ETF.

Thanks a lot! 300 bits @_date: 2016-01-07 12:17:51
No. Sorry, maybe I did not make myself clear (language problem). What I meant to say was the only thing Netflix needs to do is create a Coinbase/Bitpay account. And CB/BP could inform Netflix as soon as a payment has been received. The same message when payment has been made by creditcard/pp or whatever.
So Netflix doesn't need to change anything at all.
@_date: 2016-01-29 00:31:18
She's doing absolutely fantastic. There are so many smart people involved in cryptocurrencies but they all fail to make the things they do too difficult to understand for the majority. And that's one of the reasons why people don't want to get involved with Bitcoin. I see the Daily Decrypt as a translator between the developers and the rest of the world. It's my favorite show on YT and I learn something new every time I watch. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 11:27:53
I think Coinbase could make this possible in a heartbeat. All what Netflix needs to do is send a monthly payment request to a Coinbase user account. 
The user gets a popup on his/her smartphone and approves the payment. 
It's a win-win situation for both companies. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:07:20
What if Netflix is seeing BTC as an investment and hold it for at least two years. So when the time comes and Netflix is converting BTC to USD there's extra profit in their books (or loss).
@_date: 2016-06-29 22:59:23
No, it's just an airline company based in Europe. Sorry forgot to mention that.

One of the reasons to get out of the fiat system is because there's no transparency. No idea or influence on what banks and governments are doing. 
With Bitcoin (or any other crypto currency) it's not much different at this point. 
No one knows what is happening on exchanges, if the volumes or trades that are reported are real. Off chain transactions etc...
Why is the Bitcoin community accepting this? This is a major issue imo. Instead what I do notice is that community can talk ages about "the blocksize" while Bitcoin is still in the early adopters phase. The technology works. Logistics (gateway fiat to bitcoin) NOT.
The way exchanges work is even more dodgy than the current banking system without any insurance. 
I'm wondering if it's just me and what's your view on this.
thnx in advance.

There's a big chance that the bankruptcy court will deny civil rehabilitation and give you, as a shareholder, the remaining 160K BTC. 
Do you have any intentions to return the 160K BTC to the owners/creditors? 
@_date: 2015-11-30 12:51:06
Am I getting this right? 
So if your coins are on a exchange and that exchange will choose a certain direction which is not going to be mainstream in the future you're ......?
But if you keep your coins in your personal wallet you still can choose after a year or so which stream you want to follow? 
@_date: 2015-11-02 07:38:31
This is absolutely one of the best documentaries I've seen about Bitcoin. I think it deserves more credits.
We should share this on social media and get more people involved.

Nope, my XCP balance is 0 and trade history does not make any sence.
@_date: 2015-02-03 05:50:28
Google Wallet and Playstore etc. is my guess.
And a new worldwide Google service to convert your fiat easily to Bitcoin.
And for the future new Android phones will have a Google Bitcoin wallet. This to compete with Apple Pay.

Griff, what are the minimum requirements to enroll for this study? 
@_date: 2015-02-26 23:16:18
Thanks you for doing this AMA!
Is this the first trustworthy and transparent exchange? Can users follow all trades in the blockchain and verify your liquidity?
Or is it just as dodgy like any other exchange where we have to assume everything is true what they report and cannot we verified?
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:18:41
How about all other altcoins on Bter.com? Are they compromised as well?
