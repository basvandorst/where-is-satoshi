how did you verify the pre-paid debit? or was this card issued through your bank account?

Just wait till 10k.

At 20k yes, 3k no.

I’m sure a good read. Most big tech manufactures dictate retailers every move. Especially Best Buy. Apple probably has the most leverage though.

Not the point. To eat 50% tax, (140k) on money earned and hope for a 450% return to break even is not intelligent. 
Why not take out a personal loan for 60k, 10 yr term at like 8% interest. If things with btc don’t work out liquidate a portion of your 401k. If btc just gains 150% you pay off the loan, keep your btc and 401k. 
I’ll hang around though...

So he bought 140k and his “investment” now sits at about 60k. He needs his 18.5 btc to gain 450% to break even... yikes

Honestly I find it hard to believe someone smart enough to save 280k through a retirement fund, (401k) would be dumb enough to pay the 50% tax to take the money early / before retirement age, 65years. Personally I took out a 10k line of credit last year and purchased btc and other alt coins. Sold all btc in Sept/Oct at a good return and payed loan off. Lost most of that return on the alt-coins, but still have them in a wallet. I’m on the sidelines now, not holding any btc. I hope everyone buys lambos in a couple years... I enjoy spectating. 
Best of luck!!
