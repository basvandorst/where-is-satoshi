Sure, he had your 2FA details but wouldn't he still need a password to login? Or did he just used a saved session on your phones browser?
Either way, nice save.

SSE is Shanghai's equivalent of the Dow Jones, for example. Their stock market index.
The 3000 support refers to an effect that occurs in traders' behavior when indices or prices rise above or drop below nice round numbers.

Could you provide more details on that 30 -&gt; 2 drop? I've seen it on graphs but I wasn't on the btc scene at the time and can't find much to read about why that happened. Was it a security breach at an exchange, etc, or just a landslide popping of a price bubble?
@_date: 2012-02-12 12:47:46
It's called stable market...?

Sneakernet... as in no internet. So the black chain would essentially be passed person to person 
@_date: 2012-08-15 13:03:30
Thanks for the great insight! Why are you so sure though that another bubble burst wont happen?

You don't understand the difference between  injection attacks and information leaks, they're two very different things and shouldn't be related.
@_date: 2012-02-24 04:42:32
Seriously though... what happens here?
@_date: 2012-03-22 20:01:52
Because being anonymous is a corner stone of what makes bitcoin great.

Awesome. I would always forget and put an order for the exact amount needed. This will help dumbasses like me everywhere!
@_date: 2012-08-15 13:02:56
Dude. You rock. Thanks so much for all the info
@_date: 2012-08-29 23:05:08
Man, same thing happened to me... lost $200 to a shitty password. I'll look later and see if the address was the same. Let me know if you file a police report and how that goes. 
@_date: 2012-05-27 17:52:50
This is actually a really cool idea...!
@_date: 2012-03-22 22:02:40
True, but it makes it much more difficult to do so.
@_date: 2012-08-17 16:40:55
YEAH, BUBBLES BABY!
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:01:21
You will definitely love it more than PHP, I know I have!
@_date: 2013-10-19 03:33:52
So happy there are still competitors coming out in this space! Have too much money tired up on Mt Cocks so I'm excited to try you guys out.

What fundamental basis do you have for valuing it at over $70? There is no reason to believe that bitcoin will achieve the same liquidity and adoption in global big business as the currencies against which you compare it enjoy today. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:48:23
You got hacked, dude.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:08:56
Dude you need to take an economics class because that is most certainly not true.

Go to [ and hit "WTF?" in the top right corner. It gives you a similar graph which you can mouse over and read about.

Had this happen to me as well, earlier this year. Wasn't going to do it, but I was wondering what would have happened if I had transferred all of my cash out of the account that's tied to my coinbase acct. Seems like I could have gotten off with the extra money if I'd wanted, which doesn't make any sense for a financially based company! They got their money back in the end though.
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:00:55
Supply and demand doesn't seem to apply here though... The demand is artificial, the coins just sit and appreciate.
Like many things, bitcoin will become the metric it is measured against. And that metric is the USD exchange rate for many. It just keeps rising.
