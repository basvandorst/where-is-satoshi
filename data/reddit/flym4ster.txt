I read about some interesting papers written by Andreas lately which could be a source for some chapters... but are O'Reilly books free/open source?
My vision is more about an creative commons licensed crowd-funded and crowd-sourced book which is kept up to date by the community and can be created (PDF) and printed by everyone out there.

I think can learn much from when it comes to marketing and how to attract non-techy users. One very very important aspect of dogecoin is that you can easily posses or/and tip "huge" amounts of coin without spending much fiat money. People like to have lots of something even if its worth nothing.
**Instant action proposal:** 
If we as a community (or at least the bitcoin tipping bot) would switch to mBTC by default we could copy this effect!

Yes I have considered it (and used phonegape in the past) but using phonegap for apps which are as media centric as StreetArt Explorer is not a good idea - its simply does not perform well, especially on Android devices :/. However we plan to implement a mobile web view which can be used as backup if you are on a plattform we don't support natively yet.

One could think about splitting each chapter into two parts. One part is written in an "easy" (means non tech-savvy) way, the other one is more tech/math/hardcore and much longer. It could structured in a way that reading only the easy versions of each chapter because they are attuned and if you want some more information here and there you simply read the long version.
Fortunately many cryptographic aspects (public private key crypto and hashes for example) can be explained without showing formulas so writing an "easy" version does not mean skipping important parts.

Do you know if Mike is part of the community/reddit at all?

That would be great! Maybe you could start with providing a little bit of structure? How does your index look like?

How so? This App is meant for mapping artworks and not for tracking people.
