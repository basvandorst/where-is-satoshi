for whom?
for some (selfishly for profit) companies the current status quo is desirable, not just reasonable. for other entities and most individuals, the csq is totally unreasonable.  there isn't consensus on "for whom" this whole exercise is being run, leading to most current conflicts I see.  IMO, too many people cannot judge appropriately (discern, understand) bad behavior any longer and shut down speech from those acting badly within community norms.

This is literally the tragedy of the commons, playing out.
I got involved with Bitcoin when the price was still under usd 5. Been involved with digital commons in professional capacity and irrational interest for a few decades now. Never invested in BTC, but put in a lot of time and energy over the years.
Bitcoin is a commons, and there is deep disagreement about who that commons is "for". Making this intentional choice to spur the fee market now, by maintaining an artificial 1mb limit, makes a very clear assertion: the Bitcoin ecosystem is for miners, and for central organizations.
This position is antithetical to the original stated vision of the technology. I won't go so far to assert the commons is being mis-managed, but it's being managed so that users are the after thought, and the central organizations are squarely in control.
 Again.

it might aw well be worthless when the system you work within is engineered to take it from you without your consent.  the whole structure of modern society is about wealth preservation, and enabling the use of human labor by others.
Once the mass of humans wake up to the reality of why exactly modern society works like it does, it will crash down quickly, and the fiat system really will be worthless.  as small as 10% participation in an action by society to stop working within the current economic system would crash the house of cards the debt house is built upon

the real target for pool % should be 23%.
collusion of two operators is a possibility, so any two with a 25%+ share could cooperate to make a 51% attack.
if no pool were &gt; 23% it would require 3 to collude, not two.
unlikely that pool operators would collude?  yes.  but a 51% attack would destroy bitcoin.

well, that's how the system works.  I'm not sure what you don't understand.
"miners should have the ability" - no one is telling miners what to do, they are participating in a collective system that builds upon consistency.  what other nodes accept determine if they are paid - both the block reward and the transaction fees for transactions they mine. their payment drives their motivations, not power from an authority structure

This article completely misses the point.
There is no framework in western law that applies the concepts of property to information except "intellectual property" laws, including copyright, trademark and patents, and in some cases, trade secret law.
None of these apply to the idea of "owning" private keys.  Weirdly trade secrets are closest, but really only apply to businesses in very specific contexts.  I've studies intellectual property law, run a business in open content distribution and I'm quite familiar with that area.  Bitcoin continues to have a legal issue that remains unaddressed: in the legal framework everybody else uses for law, there is no definition by which a person can claim property rights to private keys.
I've asked attorneys, discussed on forums, it's still an unresolved issue.
It's further complicated by the fact that value imparted by the keys is not current value, it's future potential value enabled by the functioning of the blockchain.  the private keys people hold really only become valuable when you can use them to sign future transactions.  The coins themselves are yet another issue, they don't really exist in any tangible form, just as an aggregate (algorithmically defined) set of previous transactions that assert a single number on an address defined by the keys.  On top of all teh legal questions, there are technical complexities that make drafting any new set of laws to fix the property question quite difficult.

I'm not puzzled at all.  Please spread this word. 
Economists make money by conducting a social science explaining how current resource distribution systems work.  Pretty much since the beginning of human civilization, those resource systems have been centralized.  Math-based, decentralized currencies, like Bitcoin, are a new system - different from the system that economists make money describing to people.  I can't stress this enough, and almost no one sees it: **decentralized resource distribution will change the whole fabric of human society** -- it will be the largest social change we've had since agriculture.  This is not about Bitcoin, it's about how humans distribute resources, and the power and control some people can gain through centralization.  Decentralization prevents this.
It's no mystery to me: economists are negative on Bitcoin because it doesn't fit into the model they use to make money themselves.  They are simply being protectionist.

I expect the timing of blocks has a relation to the propagation time for consistency across the nodes in the network.  At some small enough time for blocks, the system would start trading off consistency: meaning there would be separate subsets of the network confirming sub chains in relative race conditions with other subsets of node sin the network.  Imagine (in an extreme) for example having 1 second blocks - large subsets of the network would move ahead with subchains, and then eventually have to drop them as other subsets transmitted longer chains to the rest.
My question, and one that could be answered from models based on current data: how low can we get the timing of new blocks before losing confirmed blocks from subsets of the network become an issue?  Is 1 minute still long enough for (most of, all of?) the network to become consistent (generally) before a new block is calculated?  At some point in decreasing block length the time will be too short and a high enough fraction of calculating nodes will run along quickly and confirm later-rejected blocks.

I'm pretty wary.  
No offense to you personally, but economists (IMO) have a very particular way of understanding the world, and their professional value comes from explaining that way of thinking to the rest of the world.  Bitcoin undercuts existing economics, entirely.  I fully expect you'll disagree with that - most of the brainwashing of economists is that their way of thinking encompasses everything, that all behaviors of people and all movement and exchange of resources fit "within" economics.  Frankly, after nearly 5 decades of science and reesarch under my belt, my respect for people who call themselves economists is incredible low, near scam artists and snake oil salesmen.
Please prove me wrong. ...not to me personally, here online, I'm not asking you do engage with me or refute me - but what I present is the principle component of my opinion about a wide swath of professionals, and everyone is very different.  Hopefully you can be too.

do not confuse high price deriving from high and growing utility from a high price derived from lack of liquidity and poor community cohesion. both can lead to higher price, but with far different long-term outcome for the tools.  there are far more useful metrics to look at than just price to understand if the technology and ecosystem for Bitcoin are healthy.  right now it clearly is not healthy on many aspects, and "Core" is following a path so far (and now still) that will not fix the issues or heal the community.

now?  yes, people proposing for-profit workarounds while keeping the block size artificially small are still blocking on-chain scaling same as they have been for two+ years. the censors in this sub. the core trolls. you (based on comments in this thread) 
segwit will never work because it is far too complex, and the overhead is too high, and blocks using it are not backwards compatible - meaning all future clients handling those blocks need segwit, AND (worst) the only reason to implement segwit is this insane for-profit mentality that other services off chain need to be brought in.  segwit does not bring "scalability", it's a complex broken workaround while the ridiculously obvious solution (larger blocks) is (still) being intentionally ignored.

wealth protection is the primary reason for governments now.  agreed.
the post refers to the fiction of intellectual property.  I'm using "fiction" in a very broad sense.  it's quite real in most people's lives, but like all property, it's really a legal fiction.
the laws vary in different jurisdictions, but basically all modern countries buy into the IP story.  In the US, for copyright it's title 17 and others.  see, for example  for patents, it's title 35, for trademark, mostly title 15.  Some also have constitutional basis.
my point is the fictions of IP have long and strong basis in law. there is no parallel laws to support ownership claims in bitcoin.  none.  that's a problem.

if I don't have control over the access to my identity information, it's really not useful to identify me.
so your question is backwards: I **have to** control access to secret data in order for the whole concept of identification work.  thus, then entities who need to identify me have to provide a reasonable reason to need those secrets.
Why does MtGox or anyone exchanging money really need to know who people are beyond the account credentials?  exchanging money or aggregating is *not* a crime, nor would it make any sense for it to be, unless what's going on is a lot more like owning people than freedom.
If you argue that we need to control people's ability to get money, for fear they will do bad things, you slide quickly into a totalitarian regime, and into precrime.

that would only work if all the exchange points in the system enforce the blocks.
if not, "tainted" coins get back into the hands of others by private exchange, and then those enforcing the blocks refuse them, so they get passed on to other unsuspecting victims on a bitcoin black market.

I have an uncle who manages a mutual fund.  He told me something interesting and relevant here.  Most investment managers make their money by selling financial products, and they stand to lose their whole business if/once bitcoin succeeds.

yes, their primary concern is their own income.
their income will drop to near zero when bitcoin folds if a single successful hijack of the block chain occurs.  if they can think long term, and about the stability and resilience of the whole bitcoin ecosystem, then the leading pool operators would voluntarily set limits on the % that any of them could control individually.

fuck everything about this
increasingly obvious to me is the intentional incapacity of the existing financial systems to allow powerful human action quickly - hoops, regulations, banker's hours, know your customer, federal approval and surveillance for any amount of meaningful money, all of this to protect
the status quo.
if you've ever been in a situation where you need to get to 10 or 20K of your own money RIGHT NOW, you understand exactly how frakked the current system is.  it's essentially impossible.
And bitcoin gets around all of this.  And so, there are now licensing requirements (permission from the people with guns) to move and transfer money??!?  if it weren't real I'd think it were a joke, a sad, cynical farce.
Bitcoin is now a growing threat to existing entrenched interests and financial systems.

It's a disaster for the market.  That's like walking into a bank with 50 $20 bills, and having the bank run them htrough a machine and tell me I can only deposit 45 of them, the other 5 are "marked" and cannot be deposited.  
Frankly, that would dramatically reduce the value of the dollar as a currency.  It's trade value would be suspect.
If by some rule or justification those coins are not good enough to be accepted on an exchange, then why would I accept them as a merchant?  Now I have the overhead of checking various blacklists and refusing some transactions if somewhere a source was blacklisted?  
The clients don't have the functionality to even deal with this.  Account balances are mixed across accounts when making payments.  Then users would have to know which accounts came from tainted sources and preferentially make payments to non-blacklist checking users from tainted accounts they got...  total  if blocking happens any time after the very first transaction.
BUT we don't know who the first transaction goes to... the group that steals coins, then holds tainted coins will simply be transferred to themselves.
The whole concept is a complete disaster.

Law enforcement works *for the people* (at least it's supposed to), and if there are real threats to society, make them public and understood, not secret and shared only within certain gun-toting, aggressive and prone-to-abuse people.

It's ethical iff the maxim of the action could be framed as a universal law.   Read Kant.
A simpler test is this.  Swap positions with those who you expect you may have wronged.  Would you willing swap?  If so, it's ethical.
Give up the money, be the owner of a computer in your bot-network, give the money and the network to the owner.  Once you can frame the situation so that both parties are *indifferent* to their position, it's ethical.  This is a simple framing and breaks down at times, but easy to understand compared to maxims and Kant and universal laws.

Most simply: Vast inequity essentially doesn't work as well as situations where individuals have closer connections to each other. Living with orders of magnitude diifferences in wealth and power means people cannot interact, communicate effectively, their worlds are too different.
Social dynamics are more stable, and more predictable when wealth and power of all individuals are within some range, and there are not outliers with vast control over many others.  Often individuals ammassing vast wealth is not a problem, though sometimes it is, their influence causes vast amounts of harm to others.
We don't have tests for people before they can accumulate vast wealth.  If anti-social behaviors can lead to vast wealth accumulation, we end up with very powerful unchecked individuals without a clear wway to prevent them from harming those less powerful.

completely agree.  pool operator collusion or coercion is a primary threat to Bitcoin.  
pool operators could mitigate this by voluntarily agreeing to never exceed 16% of mining resources.  Why 16%?  because then it would take the collusion of more than 3 of them to fork the block chain.
I've advocated this now since I first understood how BitCoin works.

those details about the building, etc. probably all just a story too.  If they had them, a far easier and more effective strategy would be a redacted corner of the form with some unique element of his SSN, or the preparers' signature, for example.
the real motivation of this scam is probably two-fold: it puts the taxes back into the news, and it also presents the possibility that the taxes are out there, and the remote possibility someone will illegally break their trust and expose the taxes in the interest of notoriety or simply public good.

I didn't assert the government was less powerful than the rich.  
In civilized countries, the formation of government comes 
with strict controls on what the state cannot do, carving our what people generally call rights.
Prohibitions on individuals' actions rest within laws, and in great inequity, laws and courts flex to the powerful.

 wha?
Any unique item fits this description.  There's a "known, verifiable, guaranteed, fixed supply" of me.  of Earths.  of the pet cat Beta.  In fact any set of unique items does too.  I have a "known, verifiable, guaranteed, fixed supply" of parents (2), and I'll never have any more.
I think what you meant is that **Bitcoin acts like a commodity (each one is equivalent) and there is a mathematically defined, socially enforced set of rules (enshrined in open source code) that will artificially set a "known, verifiable, guaranteed, fixed supply".**
 
This makes it a great possible candidate as a currency.  Given that the utility value of holding onto Bitcoins is very low (negligible), and once people use them for trade, their trade value will rise nearly without bound, their value as a currency will be very high.  We already have primed the pump on trade, in a few places, meaning that their value will very likely go up.  Not certain though for many reasons.
The real risk factors in Bitcoin are rarely discussed here but quite real.

Blocking the initial transactions from a stolen account makes sense.  No problem there.
Blocking downstream transactions that derive from other transactions connected to account stolen in the past will reduce the trading value of Bitcoin, and thus it's utility as a currency.
If the second case, blocking downstream transactions becomes commonplace, then the system of currency will be adversely affected.

the chart and thread come from counting addresses, but it is obvious that addresses are just the 50 from solved blocks, and the results of previous transactions - addresses are not people, typically a person will have far more than 1 address, there are at least 3 addresses in almost all **transactions**, 2 of them being new (the receiver address and the change going back to the originator).

These issues stem from one of the major failings of *all* open source projects:  People with project management skills, like myself, are not treated well by open source developers, or encouraged to participate on open source dev teams.  
In companies people with these skill are on the product team, typically called "Product Managers" and in healthy companies they exercise a degree of control over how the product and the UI works - meaning they tell the dev team "we need it to work like this" and incorporates a well-designed UI by UI professionals, graphics from the the graphics team, and the business goals from product and marketing.  It's not simple *at all* building a great software product.   However, the last thing open source developers need (or want) are nontechnical people telling them how to do what they are passionate about doing, for free, for the community.  That would simply kill their motivation to contribute.

true that. 
but at that point, with a "dishonest &gt;50% pool operator (dgt50ppo)" then people are playing the odds regarding if a transaction happens or not at all.  As long at dgt50ppo maintains a longer chain, he can continue to prevent blocks solved from others being in the longest block chain.  This is a meltdown of the system.
I think the community needs to take the dgt50ppo issue *extremely seriously*, and as I've written in other parts of this thread and on the forums, the community needs to maintain a 16% max on any pool.
One operator won't become dishonest alone, but 2 might collude, or more than one might be hacked or co-opted.

point 5 is wrong, complete knowledge is possible without maintaining redeemed transactions, plus all you really need are headers from old blocks, until such time as you are trying to redeem an old transaction.  clients do not yet implement these prunings.

a better understanding comes from "relative utility" and "trade value"
utility: how useful something is (hammers are useful for hammering nails, so I keep a hammer around)
relative utility: how useful are different things to me?  Is a hammer more useful than a drill?
trade: getting rid of one thing for another
trade value: what is the utility of the things I can get for this thing I have?
money is then understood to be resources for which the trade value is higher than the relative utility.  It is more useful to me to have dollars because I can trade them for other things than it is to have the slips of cloth (which really are not all that useful to do things with).

True, but if you run &gt; 50% of the hashing power, all new blocks not solved in your pool belong to other pools, or to individuals.  
If the other pools stop payouts, they stop hashing and more hash power spirals to you.

The "age of the Internet" solves the connection problem, but not the understanding gaps in large groups.

This is especially true in a techno-enabled collective where the issues at hand are INCREDIBLY complex.   Ideally, you really do want true, authentic representation by people who are "statesmen", not political - so that your interests and needs are met by the way situations become organized.

33% is still not enough.  compromise 2, or have 2 pool operators collude, and you have 66% of the hash crunching power again.
At 16%, 3 operator colluding would still only get you 48%, so it would take 4 or more to be co-opted, wrench hacked, or whatever before you got &gt; 50%.
The community has to call on pool operators to all collectively agree not to go &gt; 16%.

I agree.
Yes, in one way, the trust of the other person is not the same.
More though, trust of the existing financial system comes from promises by a government.  With bitcoin i see it more as 'understanding' when it comes to the system backing the coins, derived from the transparency and the algorithms.  The information deficit that leads to needing trust is different.

thorn?  no, BCC is going to take over.
there are only asics and network effects for 1 chain to prosper.
and here, there's only one way the value flows, and it follows *use*: more use, more value, period.  that's how it works with currency.  "Bitcoin Cash" (BCC) is solving a problem to increase the use of Bitcoin, and that is where all the smart money flows, toward increased value.  BCC may be low initially, but will overtake the "old" rules chain in a few weeks, and then all the corporate rats will jump ship, and BCC will be the only bitcoin left in about 3 months.
Let's come back and see what happens in a few months.
personally, a few days after fork, I'm taking about 40% of all my post-fork old-chain coins and buying BCC.  then over the remaining days if BCC continues to rise, I'll liquidate the rest of the old chain coins for BCC until they are at parity.  once they hit equal value, then the old chain will die quickly.

@_date: 2015-02-11 17:01:56


sort of, but not completely (difference is not the primary connotation)- most important it means: not actually, **deficient or lesser** in some way.  In common parlance it means something close without actually being the real essence of the thing.
the confusion that has happened is a lot of what is on the Internet is also defined as being "virtual" - virtual reality, virtual worlds, - essentially simulations.
BUT when it comes to money, the way dollars are used now, primarily in databases, te 'virtual' part no longer applies.
you continue with the personal attacks and it continues to weaken your position.  comic that I pointed it out and you're repeating it.  I'm completely open to changing my mind, but not because of attacks on me personally, you actually have to win the argument on it's merits.

blacklisting coins is a terrible idea, it undermines the whole system, turning coins away from being a commodity, into individualized entities with a history.
a blacklist only works if everyone uses it, otherwise some poor schmuck gets blacklisted coins for a valid transaction and then is left holding the bag when no one else will take his bitcoins.

I'm going to vote against infinity.
The primary factor that will define the stable price of bitcoin is the stability of fiat currency markets.  If those markets become extremely unstable, te price may be very high indeed for a full bitcoin, 10,000-100,000x current value is not beyond the realm of possibility in that case, however unlikely it is.
In a much more realistic scenario, there will be steadily increasing adoption of the payment method by merchants and services primarily in Internet services and digital media, and in the donation space These increases will show network effects and show increasing rates of growth as adoption continues.  Use in System D, and other black market areas will show linear growth.
The biggest risk factor is a technical fault with the system (cryptographic weakness, a botched software release allowing people's coins to be stolen, massive government effort to block or co-opt the mining operations.)  Short of that, I see an extremely strong chance the value will continue to increase.
I predict:
$35USD/BTC in Apr 2013
$50USD/BTC in Dec 2013
$100USD/BTC in May 2014
$250USD/BTC in Aug 2014

* "Bitcoin accepted here" signs
* People at conferences and events
* Paper wallets
* Whole companies dedicated to Bitcoin
* Mining rigs
"Virtual" implies something is not "real" or close to being something without actually being it.   This definition when applied to Bitcoin is harmful to the payment system, and it's exactly what the use means in context of the US Federal government discussion.
There's also a more recent version of the word, meaning it's something that exists on the Internet, and in most cases the two definitions overlap.  Bitcoin is actually an exception to the first definition, and increasingly not just on the Internet, either.

In my opinion, and the opinion I've shared with many others Bitcoin is incredibly robust, and will be nearly impossible to stop without severe disruptions to the Internet and norms of communications we all accept as given in modern society.  I've found no credible story or scenario that will crash the Bitcoin markets.
That said, markets with no supports fall.  Price could go to ~zero very quickly in the case of catastrophic failure.  This is true of **all** markets, not just Bitcoin
No buyers, lots of sellers, price goes down.  In major stock markets they've implemented controls to stop movements when prices vary too much.  No such controls that I know of on major (the one major) XBC market.
What would catastrophic failure look like?
A few scenarios may happen.  These would be incredibly rare, but in the interest of full disclosure, all are a possibility:
* altering the blockchain.  If someone finds a hole in the mathematics of the hash calculations and can insert verifiable yet false histories into the block chain, and distribute them to other clients, it would enable creation of value in existing Bitcoins.  This would undermine the whole system.
* an unresolvable error in the Bitcoin client software (resolvable errors would be bad, and reduce confidence, but not crash the market) - if someone can find a way to defeat the running client someone has and do any number of confidence-destroying acts: steal someone's Bitcoins, force them to initiate a transaction to spend their coins.  How to imagine a problem in the software like this that is not quickly resolvable is difficult, a team of experts is writing the code to prevent exactly all these issues.
* core flaws in the algorithms underlying the Bitcoin system.  If we discover a hole in the method used to track transactions, hash new blocks, or validate transactions, and these flaws lead to ways attackers can undermine the system, this would crash the market quickly.
* Concerted legal action by established military forces to find and prevent people from running Bitcoin clients.  If people start getting kidnappend and shot in the name of 'national security' in major first-world countries - and that behavior becomes accepted norm for running Bitcoin, the market will crash.
* Systemic traffic inspection and blocking on a significant enough fraction of the internet to prevent the clients from talking with each other (most likely of several "instant non-liquidity" scenarios)- this will crash the markets.
* coordinated and successful cracking attacks on the top/most of the XBC markets/exchanges.  This will have a major effect but will be recoverable as there are now several and growing exchanges.
Do I think any of these will happen?  No.  All are extremely unlikely, to "arguably impossible".  There are many other things, each with far higher probability that may happen and reduce trust in Bitcoin, but none of them will lead to a market collapse.  Additionally, these other types of problems, while far higher probability than total market collapse are **also** highly unlikely.

Market forces are the driver of value changes.  It's easier to discuss the price at which bitcoin will stabilize, because that correlates to market size, and teh relative adoption and utility of bitcoin vs alternatives.
Taking a wide variety of factors into account, my prediction is price will be stable in the 35,000-55,000 USD/Bitcoin range.  Unless the dollar significantly devalues, we're unlikely to see $100K+ values for bitcoins on a predictable horizon.  Another prediction is we'll see stability in about 5-7 years from now, but this is a highly uncertain prediction -- could be 2, could 20 years.

this is a concern I've brought up many times before, as the only "ownership" laws around information are copyright, trademark, and patents - and clearly trademarks and patents do not protect a person's bitcoins.  it's vague and unclear that copyright would provide much if any ownership type provisions for a person - so in my analysis, no there are are not any US laws that give a person property rights (or similar ownership rights) over their bitcoins.

What is the legal basis for "owning" bitcoins?  Talking personal use, or business use, not regarding the title above in your case about "seizure" and government action.
We have 4 basic legal regimes around information: patents, trademarks, copyright, and trade secrets.  With bitcoin, and individuals or businesses using them, patents and trademarks are out.  It would be an unreasonable stretch to consider someone has a copyright on their private keys, preventing others from using them and defining "owning" that way.  Weirdly, the closest seems to be trade secret, which gives rights to companies who go to reasonable efforts to keep something private - BUT I expect that body of law does not apply to the secret keys of bitcoin either.
So...  on what basis can we say that someone "owns" a bitcoin?  Is there a legal basis for it?
If someone makes a copy of their private key, does it constitute a theft?
I don't think our models, statues or caselaw around physical property or common law history around physical property apply.  Do they?
Do we need new laws that make the secret keys of bitcoin something someone can own, so they can pursue legal remedy for someone who takes them?  Others have suggested we have laws in place that practically ensure the same, preventing computer breakins and hacking.
(NB I've asked this question many times and have yet to get a robust answer.  Really appreciate any insights you have)
