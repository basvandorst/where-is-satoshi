Belgium just the same of shit artikels. It was even on the news! Bicoin.com is a sort of bitcoin bank they said ...

Thats correct but all the exchanges have growing pains and hopefully learn from this and get extra support people

never had trouble with them, just can't handle all of the extra people getting in. Just be patient and you will get your coins. Also i say a post of them where they announced searching for 28 new support people.

True but convincing them of buying 100 euro a month or investing 5k at once is a big difference
