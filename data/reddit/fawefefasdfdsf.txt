you are absolutely wrong about that. anyone who holds a bitcoin could be considered an operator.

why would people who have no faith in bitcoin provide cash liquidity to exchanges who offer these services, especially after what happened at gox?
OP is pretty dumb honestly. if bitcoin "went to zero" shorts would have no way to collect their money because any broker holding bitcoins (even those for shorting) would be bankrupt along with BTC. talk about a lose-lose situation
I can't believe people still feel smug about this. Bitcoiners truly cannot think even a step ahead.

I think you are giving too much credit to volatility. volatility is a reason to avoid trading something. 
also, there is no correlation between liquidity and "moon" as you like to call it. just because a lot of people are arguing about the price of something does not mean the price will go up.
most of bitcoins runs have been because of a corner in the market. why would anyone in their right mind want to trade that? bitcoin will always be illiquid. bitcoin was designed to be illiquid (scarce and "useful").

you'll never get your check because you are clearly not smart enough to be a schemer
ponzi/pyramid schemes are pretty much interchangeable in common language. don't be that guy who has to split every hair. I know you feel -really- smart every time you crtl-v that wikipedia article but in reality you are dumb as shit.
keep holding ;)

how do you know everybody was shorting at 400? why would you even think people were shorting at 400? look at where the volume is; 450 was your entry point if you're a trader (which you are -clearly- not)

oh! my mistake! you just recently made a lot of posts about trading so I assumed you were. that's good for you though. trading is really hard.
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:41:06


wrong. only one thing will draw in traders: liquidity. there is a reason nobody but small timers trade penny stocks, and its the same reason why only small timers trade bitcoin.

you are never going to find out
don't you get it yet?

you must not understand how a broker works
I would NEVER short something without a broker as a middleman.
there is not a single bitcoin broker I trust with my money.

even if someone believed bitcoin was "going to zero" that does not make it a good short. there are a lot of other factors, like the ones I outlined in my post. simply, I don't trust bitcoin, and I don't trust the brokers handling any and all bitcoin trades. there is no reason for me to -ever- set foot in the BTC marketplace on either end, because I honestly believe you have more than a chance to lose everything regardless of your position (Mt. Gox).
