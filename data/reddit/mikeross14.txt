I AM HODLING
I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time.  Still wrong.  w/e.  GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY.  It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.
so i've had some whiskey
actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky

Check Income tax Act 
When you buy using such website you don't intend to sell it later
If you buy above this limit and later sell then you have to pay tax on entire sale proceeds (profit = sales proceeds not sales - purchases ) 
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:59:46
When will Miners make money then?? Why would anyone close network? 
@_date: 2019-01-15 05:27:02
Yes but according to Indian law it's illegal to buy anything above 150$ with cash and taxed at 30%

The Bitcoin mempool is the pool of unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions on the Bitcoin network. Once a Bitcoin transaction happens on Bitcoin’s blockchain, it is not immediately added; instead, it goes into this pool of in-motion transactions.
Each running full node on the Bitcoin network is connected to this mempool, especially the miners. The miners, working at their respective nodes, collate a bunch of transactions from this mempool, and then they try to solve an energy-intensive math problem.
The collection of these transactions is called a “block”, and whichever miner first solves the math problem gets to add this block to Bitcoin’s blockchain. This is the first confirmation of that block.
Bitcoin’s block time is 10 minutes, but we all experience extreme delays from time to time in getting our transactions confirmed.
This happens because miners are not picking out our transactions from the mempool
