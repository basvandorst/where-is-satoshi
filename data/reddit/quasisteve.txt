Well, where does it lead?
It didn't - and perhaps still doesn't - use split key generation, which is why I wouldn't recommend the service regardless.  
tl;dr on that: without a split key generation, or with your key part generated on the server itself, the vanity address is vulnerable as the site's operator does / might know the private key, allowing them to spend the funds.  
So if it's phishing for anything, it's more like spamming people.. in order to take their funds later if the user decides to use that service.
What I find slightly curious is that the e-mail shows it's "via bitcoinembassy.ca". Weird.

Keep in mind, this is not *exactly* .  Can't know *exactly* as it depends on how much faster/slower miners mine than the 1-block-per-10-minutes goal interval.

All of the pools in the recommended pools list are good, independent, non-affiliated (with manufacturers/major services) pools.
There's not all that many left to choose from anyway.  organofcorti maintains a partial pools list: 
It's only partial because of the requirement that pool operators submit their pool details and keep them current; which is a reasonable stance, as otherwise you have to continually trawl for changes yourself and that's an unnecessary timesink.
I'll throw in a good word for BTC Dig - but they're a very, very small pool.. so don't expect anything like stable payouts.  Of course, if more people used it, that would change, so.. :)
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:15:21
Can always formally suggest it.  You'd have to put a cap on it at some point, you'd also have to allow empty blocks in the case of there being no transactions to include, you'd need some manner of rule of how far off the tip of the chain a miner can effectively invalidate another miner's block(s), etc. but most of these are technical hurdles that can be overcome.

As much as bandwidth is an issue, isn't memory use an even bigger issue?  People's bandwidth can easily be throttled, scaled up, etc.  Many of the dedicated hardware nodes are fully expected to become problematic once memory requirements start to exceed the 2GB that they tend to have - and swapping it all out to storage is less than ideal.
Perhaps a parallel post with bounty for reducing memory use would be of interest?

Everybody had a fit, Ghash.io took a "not our fault we're so damn popular" stance, eventually BitFury left them, and them being the majority of their hash rate (after a few smaller ones already left, too), they practically collapsed.  I could probably graph the demise of Ghash.io - but I'm preparing a wienerschnitzel.  Maybe later :)

No, 'most common' is mode - but you can have multiple modes.  Median is simply the middle element.  This, too, has a conflict (i.e. if there *is no middle element* but that is generally resolved using the arithmetic mean of the two elements that straddle the middle.
Wikipedia is unusually informative on the subject of 'averages', by the way.  Easy to go down the rabbit hole once you hit those pages :)

Yep.  Unfortunately there's still plenty of pools that have the default 750KB set - while some other pools are higher, but to apparent caps like 900KB or 950KB. ( Then there's pools with apparent lower still caps.  We shall not speak of them. )

I don't, but that's going to be a problem regardless of the storage medium for anything where ideally you'd make frequent backups.  Now if all the backup really has to entail is a single master key (whatever implementation) that everything else is then derived from - I'm all in favor of less perishable methods.  But that's generally not something that can be done on-device..certainly not on these small portable ones.

I'm sorry you got scammed, but: tl;dr: sold Bitcoin via paypal
Everything else is moot.  There's a reason people warn against this, no matter what intermediary service you use; e-bay, craigslist, localbitcoins, this guy who knows a guy, etc.
While it might feel good to call the intermediary a scammer, keep in mind that there's very little that such a service can do against users who scam other users.  You said it yourself: his feedback was good, his trade volume was good, what part of any of this should have alerted localbitcoins to him potentially scamming somebody in the future?
Now if you're saying that you want localbitcoins to be legally holding its users indemnified - good luck with that.  Crowdfunding sites - such as kickstarter - deal with much larger numbers and even take a commission on the funds that flow through them.. and to my knowledge so far kickstarter's argument that they're just providing the website and any disputes between sellers/buyers is between them (all the while grinning while counting the commission money) has been holding up.
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:58:15
Well, yeah. Bbut as you know, the extranonce, timestamp, etc. is all just small information that's either specced in the header, or making use of existing header space.  Making those adjustments in-hardware (be that a controller or right on the ASIC) is more of a performance saving step because the hashing chips go through the existing nonce space in no time at all, and not one that's done out of necessity because older implementations got broken at some point :)  A BFL Single or Block Erupter will still happily hash away at current blocks, and unless something else changes beside the total block transactions size, will continue to do so.

But just to point out: that is exactly what this post is about, is it not?
Alan Reiner, for example, could just as easily have accepted gratitude and thanks simply by reading such messages from their pseudonymous entity or even in complete anonymity; as can pointbiz.  He could not have accepted $2.5k in funding, at least not through the platform of choice, but that's a choice he made.
And what is it about knowing the name Alan Reiner, his face, or even his credentials that makes you trust Armory more than if you did not know these details?  Who's to say that one day he won't go rogue and slip something into the Armory client?  
Should that day come - which I highly doubt - then those who merely trust a cute face are going to be the ones hit hard, while those who dig into the code will know something's up.  
And yes, of course not everyone is tech savvy enough to verify the code.  I'm not tech savvy enough to fix bugs in LibreOffice that have been vexing me for ages and driving me back to MS Office.  But I could certainly pay somebody to fix those bugs for me, just as large hodlers can pay somebody to investigate the code.  They could then additionally choose to share these findings with other hodlers, easing multiple people's concerns based on immutable facts, rather than gut feelings :)

Right, that ( 'return unclaimed Bitcoin transaction' ) would be a non-typical Bitcoin transaction.  I'm not technically versed enough to determine if that can even be done with just script ops with the code in place at the time of the video.  BIP65 seems like it may have a related mechanism, though: 
It is, however, a feature on many online platforms where you're not 'really' sending Bitcoin from A to B, but rather the intent to send Bitcoin from A to B, and the service keeps that intent in mind until the recipient actually collects it (or, more properly, wants to spend it).  In such a scenario, if the recipient fails to collect it, the service basically forgets about your transaction from A to B and you will have the sent coins 'returned'.
It can also be done with N-of-M (e.g. 2-of-3) signatures, but that would require a trusted third a party to agree with you to return the coin.

So, you already have answers to those side questions.
As for a site that has a longer listing of blocks:
*  - 10 blocks, height/age/miner/transactions/size
*  - 14(1) blocks, height/miner/age + transactions/total BTC
*  - 15 blocks, height/time/transactions/total BTC/block reward
*  - 20 blocks, height/hash/time/transactions/total BTC/size
*  - 20 blocks, height/hash/transactions/size/total BTC
*  - 40 blocks, height/hash/time/transactions/size/fees
*  - 50 blocks, height/miner/age/size
*  - 100 blocks, height/age/hash/transactions/total BTC/fees/pool
*  - 100 blocks, height/time/transactions/fee/size/days destroyed
*  - 100 blocks, height/age/difficulty/transactions/total BTC/fees
*  - by-date blocks, height/time/miner/hash
*  - by-date blocks, height/time/transactions/miner/size
*  - by-date blocks, height/time/transactions/total BTC
*  - by-date blocks, height/time/transactions/miner/size
1) screen resolution and zoom-dependent.  14 is as many as I got.  Visually pretty, not very parse-friendly.  
\* Those with 'by-date' show the blocks for a given date, instead of 'the last N'.
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:49:41
Just because it's fresh in my memory: 
* top (out of last 10,000 blocks) mining addresses + pool associations (though they  haven't updated their detection code in ages it looks like)
* 'richest' addresses
* blocks with largest days destroyed
* 100 busiest addresses by sum
* 100 busiest addresses by # of transactions
But if you're looking for specific things, it's probably easiest to build it yourself :)

Just to add to fid77's post - if you want to find this type of information via blockchain.info:
1. Find the block of interest, say [Block 
2. In the block there should be a transaction without any inputs.  Blockchain.info lists that one at the top.  Go to that transaction.  In this case, [c643f011ab9a8a54052a305770ef927f65f7102e3fa230ac7b4f1a77c8710dcc](
3. In that transaction there should be a CoinBase part, and in there is a scriptSig.  Blockchain.info lists this separately.  There's a a long hex string in there.  In this case, "03db8205062f503253482f044f0880550870004a22510331ad092f426974467572792f ".
4. That hex string can be turned into a regular string (simple hex to binary).  In this case, as also shown in Blockchain.info, it is "ۂ/P2SH/O�UpJ"Q1�	/BitFury/"
Some things to keep in mind:   The scriptSig can be set by any miner to whatever they want.  AntPool lets people pay to have a string included there, BTC China have recently also started including custom strings.  Generally it *is* used by pools to set some identifying information - if not for the general public, then at least for internal use.  But it does also mean that I could start mining and set the scriptSig to include "BitTheCoin Pool" and everybody would be wondering when you started a pool - or I could set it to "/BitFury/" and make it seem as though BitFury suddenly has extra hash rate.

There's a list of other explorers in the replies.  However, if you want to analyze specific data, you would probably be better off using either a web API (I can recommend BlockTrail's API - it's open and fast), or use the RPC / whatever interface your local software offers, rather than trying to scrape HTML.
Any particular thing you're trying to analyze?  I recently did an analysis on these pieces of information on a thread about empty blocks, to see which miners push empty blocks the most, how that correlates with time since the last block, etc.
Example: 
Gives 200 results in a single request, including the hash, timestamp, number of transactions, size of the block, the miner/pool and some other bits.

Let's simplify this a little at first as 12 gets to really, really big numbers.
Let's say you've got a grid of 2x2 words instead, and there's 2 words you're looking for.
a b
c d
a) is basically asking how many non-repeat permutations of 2 ordered elements are in this list.  The answer: a b, a c, a d, b c,
b d, c d.  So 6.  That's not a whole lot, but watch as things go higher: Try again for 3 words out of a 3x3 grid: 84.  4 words out of a 4x4 grid: 1,820.  By the time you get to 12:12x12: 103,619,293,824,707,388 or 1.036\*10^17.  See also: non-repeating permutation.
b) This is a little bit better.  This is a non-repeating combination.  For the 2x2 example, you now get: a b, a c, a d, b c, b d, c d, b a, c a, c b, d a, d b, d c.  So 12.  Go 3:3x3: 504.  4:4x4: 11,880.  By the time you get to 12:12x12: 49,633,807,532,904,958,383,820,800 or 4.963\*10^25
You didn't ask about the scenario where words may be repeated  (a a, b b, c c, d d / a a a, a a b, a b a, b a a, b a b, b b a, a b b, b b b, etc.).  If that were the case, the first one expands to 2.593\*10^17, and the last one expands to 7.949\*10^25
c) Now things are getting a bit more theoretical.  Because one of your words is missing, for the given set an attacker cannot find your exact combination.  So instead it has to pull additionally from another set - say a dictionary list.  At that point you'd have to specify the size of the dictionary to figure out some exact numbers.  Suffice it to say that the numbers get a good chunk larger still.
d) I didn't answer yet whether the above is even 'good enough'.  You'd have to define what is considered 'good enough'.  A human being couldn't go through those permutations/combinations particularly fast.  A computer can do things a lot faster, but still with a limit.  I have no idea how fast a computer can do a dictionary attack nowadays - not to mention that in your real world scenario of an HD wallet, there's additional overhead that slow things down considerably - but let's say it could do 1,000,000,000 attempts per second, then even approach a) would take about 103,619,293 seconds or a bit over 3 years to complete all possible options.  But keep in mind that if you're extremely unlucky, it'll hit yours right off the bat ;)  approach b) is closer to 1.6 billion years.
e) I would say grab a flat dictionary file, generate some random numbers between 1 and however many entries there are, and pluck those straight from the file.  There's probably scripts and utilities and so on that do this - random google result: 
P.S. The above may be completely wrong.  Stop asking math questions before coffee :)

For posterity:  
tl;dr: You buy hash power from a vendor.  You point said hash power at proxy.  Proxy forwards to actual pool - but occasionally makes the pool pay out to the proxy's address (fee for this 'service').  The actual pool pays out full shares.  Proxy underreports the shares back to the you cq the vendor.  You then claim to the vendor that you're not getting the hash power promised, and demand a refund on the difference.  Payouts at actual pool - proxy service fee + refunds = profit for you (when in general renting mining power = loss).  Proxy fee - service upkeep = profit for proxy. Loss all around for vendor and related services.
And yes, it's fraud.  I don't know what educational purposes were intended other than making people aware that it's possible somebody's already doing this.
Having local miner statistics is important in dispute cases as pool-side statistics cannot be trusted (variance alone suggests this is a bad idea anyway).  Yes, that reduces things to 'he said, she said' at best.  Beats getting scammed outright though.
Better still is to allow only known pools in hash rental interfaces.  While this limits choice (there's not that much choice anyway), it also limits exposure to this type of fraud or having to deal with customers using technically inept pool operators.

While I agree with what you're saying, doesn't everybody pulling their weight in terms of Bitcoin's technology have a conflict of interest one way or the other?  
And if everybody has a conflict of interest one way or the other, then aren't all opinions equal once more?
If you can point to specific people whose opinions are entirely free of conflict - and are actually knowledgeable enough on the subject to have an informed opinion (i.e. certainly not me) - that'd be great.
( I know you're not saying that others' opinions are to be dismissed just because of their potential conflict of interest - but that is how conflict of interest issues are typically resolved. )

"Still too expensive" is the bit that's going to hold many people back.  For the record, the hardware in question is $168 (excluding shipping).  Similarly, RaspNode was $100 in the kickstarter (excluding shipping and USB storage), Bitseed v2 is $169, ChainBot HD-v1 Light is $179 and ChainBot HD-v1 is a whopping $299.
These are not the price points at which mass adoption of nodes is going to happen except for those who have a deep interest or are 'geeky' enough.
On top of that, or in combination with it, an incentive to run a full node other than "validate your own transactions so you don't have to trust others" would be good, as most people these days - sad to say - are happy to trust others with everything.  They're happy to trust Apple with all of their payment details because they don't want to have to enter it separately for each and every app or service.  They're happy to trust Google with their e-mail because local mail clients are a beast, slower, not as good at filtering, and their own ISP's mail server every once in a while gets blocked by some silly blacklist while gmail would never end up on one.  
Bitnodes do have a financial incentive program -  - but it would be good to see more or other forms.  A device that can double as a wallet and/or miner (one of the few places a 21 Inc chip might make some sort of sense), for example, immediately makes the node do something more for the user that more directly impacts them.

The 'active' status is explained in BIP1.  Basically it's the status of a BIP - limited to Informational and Process BIPs - that may never be 'finalized' (but at any given point may be considered 'accepted').  BIP1 is the only one that is in this status not because it's particularly special, but because no others have been proposed yet that fit the description :)
A particular feature's use in the wild doesn't really determine its status.  That's up to the BIP editors to declare.  I do notice that there's a fair bit of disagreement between the list, pages, and what's in the repo - if nobody else will, I'll go through them later and see about updating the wiki.
As for which BIPs are most important - that probably depends on what you're working on.  If you're working on a wallet, then your interests are going to be different from that of a miner.

The tl;dr and also clarification that isn't quite given in that thread, for the curious:
RBF = "oh crap I forgot to add a fee, let me resubmit it with a fee" or "dangit, blocks are getting full, and I really need my payment to go through - I know, I'll just increase the fee!"
So here's the privacy issue with that, let's go with the 'forgot a fee' scenario for simplicity:  
Say you have 1.0 BTC.  You send 0.8 BTC from A to B and 0.2 BTC from A to C.  Only you and the actual recipient of the payment at this point know which is the payment, and which is the change address (short of correlation measures - out of scope for this thread).  Maybe you paid 0.8 BTC for something, maybe you paid 0.2 BTC for something.  
At this point, you realize you forgot the fee, so you re-issue the transaction, and add an 0.01 BTC fee, and are left with these transactions: 0.80 BTC to B, 0.19 BTC to C
Presuming the recipient doesn't want to eat fee costs, it's a good assumption that you paid 0.8 BTC to B, who is the recipient, and C is your change address, because that's the only one that changed from your previous transaction.  Now A and C are linked.
That thread is pretty recent, so expect further responses from people there, especially with regard to mitigation.
Edit: slight further clarification.
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:29:27
I don't think that would be a requirement, per se.  After all, blocks already get orphaned from time to time and nodes have to accept that any transactions that were part of that block may not be in the block that ended up getting accepted.
It's more the simpler things, really.
E.g. a 100-transactions block replaces a 0-transactions block.. no-brainer.  But does a 1-transaction block replace a 0-transactions block?  Does a 101-transactions block replace a 100-transaction block?  Thus capping it - i.e. if there's N transactions in or M size on or P fees in the block, then it's not eligible for getting replaced.
'No transactions to include' can also mean 'No transaction with reasonable fees'.  I don't think think we should punish miners who don't want to include transactions with zero fees.. at least not in this manner.  That's a different discussion, but is something that would have to be dealt with in this proposal as well.
'How far off the top' - e.g. in this case, there were 2 empty blocks. Is the first empty block still eligible for getting replaced, even though technically it was already built-upon?  In this case it's built-upon with another empty block, but what if the block that builds upon it is a 'good' block?
I don't think it's a bad idea - and probably one that's been had before (I haven't googled) - but would definitely need fleshing out.

They weren't much of an 'enemy', tbh.  Victim of their own popularity, perhaps.  I'd just rather see all pools with a roughly equal slice of the pie.  Pools that only have a very small percentage of the network tend to falter; BTC Guild being the latest to throw in the towel citing this as one of the reasons (certainly not the only reason).

If the people are running a specific app, then I suspect that app requires access to the user's location.  At that point, whether the app communicates that location to a central server, or the central server communicates with the apps and only requests a "are you in area X? Yes or No", you've already got all you need to determine whether a specific user should get that rain or not.

Yep, I know, but afaik it should already be accurate; you already have the "/BitFury/" string as scriptSig detection approach.  It's just.. not working, for some reason.  That or the .json in the repo isn't active on the site.  Of course it can't hurt to add the new address, but still.. the scriptSig should work.

Under the assumption that every miner has a 'fair' chance at seeing block announcements (they can't mine a block without knowing the last one anyway), then every miner can also see that the block is empty (or otherwise satisfies criteria for being replaced), and attempt to build their own bigger version of that block - rather than the next block.  If they choose otherwise and instead attempt to mine the next block, that's fine, but then they take the risk that your block ends up invalidating their work.  Alternatively, maybe they do mine the next block, and you have been wasting your time trying to build a bigger block as *their* new block locked in that empty block (potentially.. see some mutterings on this elsewhere in this thread)

What's slightly surprising is that...  
Of the 5 Chinese pools that have recently stated that they would support 8MB blocks (3 of which signifying as much in their coinbase), 2 have yet to increase their cap (F2Pool was already at 1MB).  
The stress test likely had less to do with BTC China's decision to up their cap than the tangential discussion pointing out that pools were left at default settings in the first place.

It's something agreed upon.  It's basically a defined value in the code.  That value can be changed, but unless there's consensus on that change in the Bitcoin network, then any block that would deviate from that predetermined schedule would be rejected.
Yes, those coins would be lost.  Yes, in theory, that makes each slice of Bitcoin become worth more.  Yes, some psychopath who thinks that killing people who hold a lot of Bitcoin increasing the value of the Bitcoin they themselves hold is an avenue they wish to pursue over, I dunno, being a psychopath who only threatens with death and just taking all that shiny Bitcoin, could very well be borne out of this nature.

Just to add to this - very often for merchants there's already an entry, so you can skip all of the steps of adding the point, specifying the business type, and so forth and so on, and merely add or modify the payment options.

Geeze that's a lot of questions that should probably have their own post - if they hadn't been asked before anyway ;)
tl;dr on the subject line: It has been mused about by several developers before.  Quite seriously when ASICs first appeared, and sporadically here and there whenever there's a perceived threat.  Though if you think the block size debate is a popcorn-y one, any direct and serious proposal to change the PoW algorithm would be one where you'll want the lazy chairs with cup holders as well.

Here you go:  
Both of the peaks were at or around 50%.
After the first public concern some people left, but - just as with today's pool - some people stuck around or even came back finding that they preferred stable payouts over potentially higher but less predictable payouts.
After the second public concern, more miners left - including BitFury - and now it's one of the smaller pools.

In short, no.
The ASIC machines only hash the header, which itself contains information on the previous block, a merkle root hash of the included transactions, etc.  So the header doesn't actually grow along with the number and size of included transactions, and ASICs will carry on merrily mining.

You're making an attempt at a "if you've got nothing to hide", but phrasing it in a way to incite people to demand the identity of the person behind the site.
But you still haven't given a compelling argument as to why this would be needed.
If those large HODLERS are uneasy about not knowing who is behind the site, then why were they using the service?  
If those large HODLERS are truly concerned about security, then why don't they (pay someone to) audit the code?  
If they are uneasy about the identity because they put more faith into the person details than they put into the work, then I'm afraid they need to get in the bag with TMZ, Dish Nation and Newsweek.

Just keep in mind that the IP addresses reported at blockchain.info - and arguably any other site - are not necessarily that of the miner.  The IP address is not part of the block, but rather information that the service running a node collects as the IP address that they received the information from.
Unless you have a direct connection to the miner's node, you're really just going to report the IP address of a peer of the miner, or a peer of the peer of the miner, etc.
Blockchain.info does try to have a lot of connections, so over time you can look at reported IP addresses and try to gain confidence in which IP address is the most direct route to the miner.  But it's not 100% guaranteed.

One of the arguments made against larger block size by some miners is the longer time to propagate, etc.  An alternating setup would be biased in favor of those who prefer larger blocks.  It would also be rather annoying to add as code :)

I can't - as I said, to *them* it might appear to be rational.  I'm not convinced it *is* mathematically/economically rational.  AntPool has more 'empty' blocks, but their little scatterplot thing doesn't have such a clear delineation.  Thankfully, it's still very much the minority of blocks that are empty and none of the large pools seem to be mining empty blocks exclusively.

Now.. they could certainly send you Bitcoin back, and I wouldn't fault them for choosing whichever works out best for them (BTC originally paid or equivalent fiat amount), but they're probably not set up for that.  They could look into some of the mechanisms that enable refunding more easily, regardless.

'most bitcoin mining today' is done using ASICs, the majority of which are completely inaccessible in terms of configuration via the internet, and the remainder of which have reasonable strong security practices (but operators that tend to throw caution to the wind will find their precious miners mining away happily.. just not to the address they had specified originally).
Botnets did exist, as did malware, but a good chunk of that was already rather pointless.  10,000 CPUs that together mine a few satoshi = a few ten thousand satoshi.  It's not exactly making a dent.  Admittedly, it doesn't have to - any satoshi gained at somebody else's cost is almost pure profit, but meh.
Doge and other altcoins that can still be reasonably well-mined with GPUs and CPUs - even the mobile variants - are more lucrative targets.

I have to say though that the only one where this becomes immediately apparent is F2Pool.  While I suspect the others do this as well, as far as I can tell they also tend to immediately accumulate transactions for inclusion in blocks sent to further miners or new mining rounds (however that is set up in their controllers).  F2Pool seems to have a bit of a delay and/or threshold (the 100KB).

Unfortunately, efforts like Coinmap or just any physical presence merchant directory require ongoing maintenance.

Just to point out - without designer release and licensing information, most 'clip art' sites will happily just grab anything off the interwebs and say "here, have this for free!"
Unfortunately, this is so pervasive on the clip art-offering side that it's often dang near impossible to find an original designer unless they happen to step forward, and then further offer proof.

Sure, I can think of many.  For example, while it's entirely possible for people to verify the code - and I'll get back to that in another comment further down - there's people who don't do so in detail and instead trust that the site is working as designed and perhaps at best check it against the GitHub repository.  Somebody who wanted to subtly adjust the code would have to do so in two places; something that's not as easily done as it is in a single place.
Unless, that is, if you have leverage - and that is something that the person's identity can provide.
I'm not saying that is their reason - they could very well just not care about getting personal messages about how grand their site is, or how it could be made better, and the other usual nagging that you'd more frequently see in discussions about e.g. BitcoinTalk.
More importantly, I don't really care what their reason is, because the code stands on its own.  I can review it, I can make sure it's not using a crappy random number generator, I can make sure it's seeded appropriately, I can make sure it's doing all that it needs to do - nothing more, and nothing less.  Whether you coded it, Gavin coded it, or some random other person coded it, doesn't really matter when you can do all the above.

Well sure - but you get those at a centralized pool just as well - and there's a few of those still floating around with smaller share than P2Pool.
@_date: 2015-06-13 12:27:13
Without having looked at the code too closely, that seems to be a lower bound?  I.e. "assemble transactions until we hit this size, and then and only then compile the header for hashing".
A pool wouldn't be creating a zero-transaction (well, coinbase-only) block if it were strictly holding to such a lower bound.
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:54:05
Perhaps clients - including Bitcoin Core - should have an additional option when 'receiving' a transaction?  
(o) Accept  
( ) Ignore  
( ) Reject
Where accepting it makes it spendable through that client.  Ignoring it makes it not spendable, but at a later time you can always un-ignore it (this would require some sort of ignore list, of course).  Reject makes it not spendable and doesn't put it on that ignore list (effectively making it 'lost' until such a time as the user 'rebuilds' their wallet(s) from scratch)
This would have to come with some text explaining why on earth you'd want to ignore/reject money sent to you, of course ;)

We could try to fudge some math on that :)
Right now we're at block 361,890.  The next halving is in 58,110 blocks.  58,110 blocks * 10 minutes = 34,866,000 seconds.  34,866,000 seconds from now is roughly July 29th, 2016.  So that about checks out with what the clock says.  
You're guessing 'a month or two' sooner - let's go with 2 - or about May 29th 2016.  That's 29,635,200 seconds.  29,635,200 / 34,866,000 ~= 85%.  So the network's hash rate would have to grow, steadily, at around ~~15%~~ 17.65%
I think that's being a bit on the optimistic side in the current climate, but future history may yet prove you right :)

Unfortunately that's just a blockchain.info message.  You could include one in a transaction, or - slightly easier - pay for it to be included in the coinbase at e.g. AntPool or BTC China.  Then it'll live on the blockchain forever (and without particular encoding-to-addresses shenanigans)
@_date: 2015-06-21 16:26:25
Right, 'grow steadily' :)  That's why just making it grow by 1,000% in a single period, followed by no growth at all, isn't going to do much to move the 'when' of the next halving.

Soylent Paper is people!
tbh, even the smallest places in the U.S. seem to take credit cards.  I saw more signs saying they didn't take cash than I did signs that said they didn't take cards.  That, almost by definition, requires the merchant to have a piece of technology - which the end-user could then make use of to perform a transaction anyway.. as long as they carry with them a list of return addresses that they have the private key to, somewhere, if they don't trust the merchant (and they shouldn't.)  The only exception is all the toll booths.  EZ-Pass sure was nice to have while I drove the rental.
Anyway.. yeah, people could print paper wallets and people could accept those.. that puts a lot of trust in the person, though.  With things like the Casascius coin you and the merchant would reasonably know that a trusted third party (Casascius) generated the coin, that the correct private key is held within the physical object itself unavailable to the you unless you made it evident that the object has been tampered with, and that the face value is that which is 'contained' within the address.  That 'trust' is practically impossible for self-printed paper wallets.  That's where multiple-party keys may come in useful.

Seriously though.. they're required to pull that crap by the law.  Yes, it wouldn't be an issue with Bitcoin.. until you tried selling that for Euros.
Today there was a news item for the cops investigating a find of X amount of cash (think several hundred thousand Euros) in somebody's home (Dieudonné, google it, not really a factor for this paragraph).  On the one hand.. so what, if somebody wants to keep their money in cash, at their home, let them do it.

I think there's a difference between 'basic price information' and troll posts.
If I posted "Current price: $M, UP|DOWN from: $N (24h)" - that's one thing and while I think mild attacks would still be fine (isn't a price ticker now, is it?) I agree that they don't deserve vitriol or praise, whichever may be the case.  
( Note that either generally gets downvoted;  )
But I would hope you understand that most of these posts (down OR up) are not even remotely about 'basic price information discussion' and more about trolling|spam.  If not, I fear you would suggest that the "lost 5oo bitcoin!" posts are a valid starting point for discussion on wallet safety, and the "free o,o5 bitcoin for everyone" posts are highly informative services notifications that are worthy of upvotes.

Isn't it just HTML tables?  Select the text in the table (just start in the top left corner, end in the bottom right), copy to clipboard, and paste into your spreadsheet.  Excel (as well as Calc etc.) will know what to do and paste each table cell into the appropriate spreadsheet shell.
Edit: Oh, and if you're feeling adventurous - they can also use an online resource with tables as a semi-live data source directly.  I hate that, though.. it's slow, terribly error-prone, and updates depending on the alignment of planets or something.
Edit 2: Having just tried  - in LibreOffice calc, if you paste directly, you'll get some odd formatting.  Use 'Paste special', choose 'unformatted text', then it will parse it as CSV-type data instead (complete with CSV data import dialog), and will be fine.

yes - collisions can happen.  They're just extremely unlikely when addresses are properly generated (and not using a single-seeded brainwallet with you and 999 other people all using the passphrase 'password').  
no - shorter addresses are not less secure, you'll still need the private key that hashes to that address in order to spend from that address.  
maybe - ghash could indeed dedicate a lot of computation time to try and generate a collision, but it's far more profitable to just mine instead.

It's legit in Japan and the EU.  The idea was/is for the trademark to be used protectively - i.e. to stop anybody from exploiting the Bitcoin name for negative purposes.
Without knowing your intent I'd say pre-registering domain names that, I can only assume, include the word 'bitcoin' may well be covered by that ideal.
Then again, this is Tibanne, of MtGox fame, and after MtGox went under they were (or still are?) looking to sell the trademarks.
Note that I'm not a lawyer, but iirc you'd have little legal standing behind the trademark anyway, as the name has fallen into common use.  If your domain names are important to you, tell your registrar that you disagree/etc.  Make sure to ask your lawyer if things escalate from there.

To add to beejiu's reply: Currently 25 Bitcoins.  A small piece of code determines how high the reward is based on what block number it is.  In the future, that will reduce to 12.5 Bitcoins, and then later still it will be 6.25 Bitcoins, and it keeps on halving like that until it's halved so much that you're not adding any more, especially as the code itself simply can't divide any further.
Similar code also makes sure that somebody who does that work to 'update the ledger' can't just write in "I'll take 1,000 Bitcoins, please", because everybody else checking their calculations will be "Uhhh, no? Nice try, though." and reject their work entirely.  Note that the same applies if they'd said "I'll take 1 Bitcoin" (though there's no good reason to do so, of course).

People sure are suicide-happy on reddit - that prevention thing gets posted when people get a papercut.  It seems to hover around the triple point of posts being serious, trolling, or meant as humor.
On-topic.... which of these two 'lose' scenarios describes you best?
A. You bought in 'high' - let's say back around when it was $600 again - and by now it's at $420.. so you had an actual loss.  Specifically, you had a loss of $180 per Bitcoin.  At a $500,000 loss, that means $500,000 / $180 = 2,775 Bitcoins initially purchased.  2,775BTC * $600USD/BTC = 1,666,666.  Seems to me if you can throw 1.6 million at something, you're probably not going to be all that depressed in the first place, and need a reality check: you're most likely way better off than the vast majority of people - not just in Bitcoin, not just on Reddit, but on the world.
B. You bought in low, then it went high, and now it's low again.  Hell, maybe you bought in when it was $100/BTC, in which case, you didn't 'lose' anything, and you're still way, way up... but you cry yourself to sleep at night anyway knowing that it was even MORE up not too long ago, and kicking yourself for not selling at that time, and need to get hit by a cluebat.
C. You spent all your life's savings, your kid's college fun, the second mortgage and all the money you loaned from family, friends and loansharks.  You're also an idiot.  But hey, even idiots shouldn't have to off themselves over terrible choices, so work something out.  Don't be above servitude if it rights the wrongs.

The main problem is that using steganographic techniques you can only store a relatively small amount of information AND the application viewing the image needs to know to extract that information, and do something useful with it.  I.e. if you used it, pirinted it out on some cards, and handed those out.. there's no reason to even think there would be more information in there.  You would have to point it out - at which point, you're once again just adding plain information that can be cropped out, and could just as well have placed the QR code.
Steganographic techniques are usually more used for secretly embedding information, either as a means of communication, or for copyright identification purposes (e.g. claiming a work somebody 'stole' (copyright infringed) is yours, somebody else says 'prove it', you feed the image into a steganography program, give it the correct key, and out pops "this image by amnesiac-eightyfour". )

That depends on whether they're referring to the Bitcoin Currency Blockchain (for lack of a better term, this descriptive one will do), or just 'a blockchain'.
The former can't be separated.  You can certainly build on it - sidechains and all that - but in terms of how it's secured, who secures it, etc. you're pretty much at the whim of the players in Bitcoin Currency.
But blockchain technology itself is certainly something you can 'separate' from Bitcoin.  Litecoin et al have already done as much; they made changes to some components of how the blockchain gets secured, but the fundamental workings of a blockchain are still the same.
I like to believe that it is blockchain technology in general that they're referring to when talking about the potential of 'the blockchain'.  But they could be talking out their ass just as well :)

Yeah, double-spending is actually not that huge of a deal for the malicious actor - basically, there's worse things that can be done... including making it so that thousands of people could double spend (as one of those worse things is essentially making previous transactions null and void, so say you spent 1BTC last week, and the malicious actor has been building on a chain that doesn't include that transaction, and tomorrow they dump their chain onto the network... you magically have your 1BTC back.  As do I.  And John. And Marie. And Pjotr. And Chang.  And and and.
To address a tangential issue you mention - i.e. 'just block the bad actors' - that would also set bad precedent.  You mentioned exchanges, though, which already have some level of requirements on that front.  It would be inefficient, though, as they would simply approach things 'a penny at a time' and build up their heist that way.

Just because they'll happily accept N%, doesn't mean they wouldn't even more happily accept &lt;N% IF that is a feasible option to them.
E.g. say there's a company that stocks your vending machines for you, and they take 2%.  You're happy to pay the 2% because stocking those things is a pain in the ass and you've got better things to do while minding your establishment, and more fun things to do in what should be your spare time.  
Then along comes a competitor that offers the same level of service, but only takes 1.5%.  The damage to you is in setting up a new contract, but other than that, it's hands-off again, and you get to keep an additional 0.5%.  
Compare that again to saying that they could go for 0%... but then they'd have to stock the machines themselves.  Yeah, no.

You need to keep in mind the total system energy use.  Multiply that by the hours in a year to get your yearly kW*h figure, multiply that by your $/kWh to get expense.
So let's take one of the latest Core i7 figures on that list, it's for the 3770k model.  Here's a review of a system that uses it and has some figures for the CPU under load:    
160Watt is their claim for their test system, non-overclocked.
Let's say your energy cost is $0.10/kWH.  160Watt = 0.16kW.  0.16 * 8765.81h/y ~= 1400kWh.  1400 * $0.10 ~= $140/year.
Presuming the listing in the wiki is also for non-overclocked, then a claim for hash rate there is 5.2Mhash/s.  Calculating into the future is difficult as we don't know what the difficulty is going to go - go up, go down, etc.  So instead of speculating, you could check what has happened in the past year.  takes a prior date range, a given hash rate, and returns the total number of Bitcoin you would have gotten under ideal circumstances.
If you plug in June 1st, 2014 through June 1st, 2015, and 5.2Mh/s, you'll see nothing happening - the output remains 0 BTC.  This is not a bug, but rather a rounding issue.  The total amount of Bitcoin you would have made is so low that the site has it rounded down to 0 BTC.  We can get the exact number, though*: 0.00003252701996608492 BTC.  Now, Bitcoin itself currently doesn't deal in anything smaller than 0.00000001 BTC (1 satoshi), so we must truncate that figure to: 0.00003252 or 3,252 satoshi.  At this time, that would be worth about 0.007284 USD.
Suffice to say that for CPUs, you can practically ignore how much they would return and look only at the energy cost.
I hope this helps :)  In the future, also try \* Involves modifying the javascript to remove the rounding function, then re-entering the values.

That depends on whose blockchain you're referring to, and which parts of it are public.  In the case of Bitcoin: No.  You'll have to jump through some hoops to get (relative) anonymity vs pseudonymity.  You can try googling for something like 'tumbler privacy' for some studies into how even when using tumblers - at least at the time - they could identify some users with N% probability.
There are other coins that have anonymity at the core of their design, with varying degrees of success.  They still use a public block chain, but the data within that chain is vastly different from Bitcoin's public ledger.

You'd have to trust the person you're buying the private key from to not know it in any which way shape or form.
Instead, use a split key generation method.  This is similar to split key vanity addresses, with the only difference being that you don't really need to bother with the 'vanity' aspect (though you still could, for a premium, say).  Google around for how that works.
I don't know what premium would apply to minted coins - especially since the service in question would still be involved.. could just as well use a tumbler.
Whether that, in turn, would constitute a laundering service depends on who you talk to.
If the service does use split key, then it would not be appropriate for meat space, due to timing constraints.

The address was generated by concatenating the required leading character '1', then a constructed string 'BitcoinEaterAddressDontSend', and a CRC that is valid for it, 'f59kuE'.
If you actually wanted to generate that address, you'd have to wait a few.. eons.  Look up vanitygen and give it a try :)
Note that it's not *impossible* that somebody would have the private key, or generate a valid private key for it, just *extremely unlikely*.  Where 'extremely' is being mild.

I think he needs to work on his spelling, grammar, and check his emotion at the door when writing papers ;)
That said, there's a few good points being made about the technical side of Bitcoin (transactions don't have timestamps, leaving it purely to the block chain to determine which transactions are valid, which - in part - opens up a double-spend scenario that could otherwise be rejected by the network).  
The rest, however, is largely speculative - and the author does admit to that.  One big example is the reward halving coming up in ~2 years.  The speculation being that many miners will stop, as 12.5 BTC would make it no longer profitable for them.  When this happens, there's a good chance that there will be miners (or pools) that can easily attain 51% of the network hash rate, and effectively 'control' Bitcoin.  Their own counter-point is that, in fiat, reward halving has occurred several times, and that did not seem to have deterred mining at all.  
Of course these two are not entirely comparable - those in it for the long haul may well be more affected by the reward halving than any fiat halving, if they simply expect the fiat exchange to go back up anyway.
Either way, have a read, it's not exactly "ZOMG Bitcoin's gonna die!", while it's also not the most well-researched piece, but it won't hurt your brain too much.
@_date: 2014-09-04 11:50:02
The page needs explanation on how it's being calculated and displayed; i.e. as it is, it's actually showing a theoretical amount of Bitcoin mined since the page was last refreshed - rather than there '1 BTC being mined' at t=1 and '2 BTC being mined' at t=2.
I realize they're going for aesthetics more than technical accuracy, but it probably couldn't hurt to include an actual count (i.e. monitor for actual mined blocks occurring \* current reward) as well.

Similarly - assume you're running an RPi and forgot (or didn't bother to) set up an NTP sync and daylight savings throws things off by an hour.. should the block be invalid?

To be honest, isn't that what the author desires? Essentially he's trolling people, as he presents Bitcoin as 'a con' - when what he's actually writing about is overly optimistic people and actually fraudulent people trying to get people to buy into Bitcoin based on false promises and/or claims that aren't necessarily true now or may very well be proven to be false in the future.
On the other hand, he does applaud the technology. Thing is, Bitcoin is the technology.. what people do with it may well be worthy of the label 'con', but conflating the two doesn't do his already overt bias any favors.

Bitcoin address shorteners of this format are a 'bad' idea - if for no other reason than that the site could be compromised and 'shortened addresses' redirected to different ones.  So when you tell your buddy to just look up btcaddr.es/MyAddress and it redirects to an address that is *not* yours, your buddy wouldn't even know until it's too late.  It also doesn't help that there are a plurality of such sites - some specific to Bitcoin, but any generic URL shortener would do the same job - so telling somebody that they should just look up btcaddress slash myname can result in being redirected to another such service, where 'myname' ends up pointing elsewhere.
blockchain.info does offer its own labeling option, which requires you to sign the label using the private key that belongs to the address.    This makes it more fool-proof at least at blockchain.info, except that labels are not (afaik) unique - so you would still be required to tell the other party exactly which address was intended.
Another option that was popular at one time is FirstBits.  Essentially the address in the blockchain (THE blockchain, not the blockchain.info site) are all assumed to be unique.  A substring, such as the first N letters of an address, however is not unique.  But in the blockchain, only one of the addresses that match 'came first' in terms of funds send to it.  This does not yield nice legible short labels, but at least relies entirely on the blockchain and can be used at any site.  Of course all of the really short ones, and the ones that were of legible interest, are already taken, either simply by being first, or by having been created specifically for the purpose of 'being first' using a vanity generator.
Possibly the simplest solution to this problem (insofar as it being a problem) is to drop a receiving address in your social media profile and tell people, to whom you cannot convey the address verbatim, that they can find the address in your facebook/twitter/whatever profile.

Right, short-term, as I mentioned.

They don't have to get 6 in a row on the public network.  They only have to be able to form the longest chain - which, by definition, they can if they have the exceed the network's hash rate.  They can simply solve blocks, not announce the solutions to the network, and when they have a whole bunch of them, dump it onto the network at that point, and have the leading chain by a healthy margin.

\*loses, dammit.  loses.  And it should well lose its shit, because there's little to no information about why the apps were actually removed (the final one that sparked the whole shit-losing event just had as a reason 'unresolved problems' or somesuch.  Combine that with Apple's "thou shalt not publish thy rejection details" stance, Apple's history as bucking against the trend but slowly becoming the trend, etc. and you've got a perfect (shit)storm.


Weird.  I seem to recall reading about these things all the time.  Usually, though, the issue tends to be one of "well the dumbass *did* get involved with drug money" or, as in the latest 3 cases, "in their state they should have registered as money transmitters - they didn't - their own fault".
Now.. are those money transmitter laws just?  Well that's another matter entirely.  E.g. the Florida one - between $300 and $20k in a 12-month period?  Suppose I forget I've got €250 in my wallet when I fly to the U.S. and, rather than bothering with the regular exchange at the airport that takes a decent chunk, I get some random person who's flying to Europe to buy it from me for the $340 it's currently, roughly, worth?  It's win/win for us both - except now I'm committing a third degree felony.. and so are they. lol?  
Bitcoin, and other 'virtual currencies', just make this more succinct because a lot more people may have to deal with this.  The question of course is whether Bitcoin should indeed be seen as something that falls under money transmitting laws the same as the native and foreign currencies do, and how those same rules would apply to tangible goods that would act as an intermediary in illicit activities.
But, as it stands, those laws are there and if you don't adhere to them.. yeah, you get special interest from The Man.  Crickets warranted.
As soon as Apple says "We're not going to allow any type of wallet app - be that Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin or otherwise", the shitstorm would equally die down because the rules would be clear.

Long enough, or intricate enough, that it defeats the point of a 'brain' wallet password for most people.

'correct horse battery staple' - already in common attacks as a phrase  
'correct horse battery stapling gun' - dictionary attacks.  
'c0rrect h0rse battery stapl1ng gun' - common substitution attacks.  
'c0rrect, h0rse! battery. stapl1ng. gun!' - a bit more like it, but down the road, do I remember if I ended that with a ! or a .?  If my first attempt fails, do I try 'C0rrect' because I think maybe I capitalized the first letter?
Now if, instead, I used a simple phrase, generated a hash out of that, and then used *that* as the phrase - now an attacker has to know what hash function I used *and* what simple password, because dictionary attacks etc. aren't going to work to find the input, while for me it's much easier to remember just the simple phrase + hash function used.

Sure, it wouldn't let you try to do identity theft or make payments with the stolen data - but neither would the 'stolen' credit card data if the CC companies would just issue new cards to anybody who shopped at Target (and other companies affected) and disable the old cards upon activation of the new card or after 14 days (whichever comes first, and 14 days is being generous.), instead of this crap where Target tries to contact customers, gives them a year of fraud protection, etc. etc.  That's just a back-asswards way of handling it, yet the average consumer is loving it ("free stuff?

Sure, it's useless to the people in those countries, but that's no different from banknotes and coins in terms of them being 'dollars'.  They quickly become nothing more than tokens of exchange.  In the middle of Ohio one of them might be exchangeable for a loaf of bread, while in New York you might need to throw of them at it.  I say 'them' because it can hardly be called a Dollar anymore.
You bring up gold and silver, which is funny - how much of either do you have stashed away for the inevitable apocalypse?  Most people don't have any.  Yet they would be a much better-suited option than dollars which, again, are relatively easy to counterfeit.  Heck, people are doing so now, and it's costing society.
Basically, sure, if all the world suddenly were without electricity, Bitcoin is pretty useless.  But so is every other modern currency.  I think that would be a rather more noteworthy problem than any problems with Bitcoin :)

Are 'we', though?  And, food for thought, isn't stingy tipping better?
Playing devil's advocate here... when you tip WhateverAltCoin, you're essentially tipping... well, not a whole lot.  When you tip Bitcoin, even if it's just 0.01 Bitcoin, that's a decent $6 right there.  While I don't mind tipping $6 and regularly tip more than that after a good meal, I don't see myself throwing $6 around left right and center just for the sake of tipping.  On the other hand, I could tip satoshis.  There is a satoshi tip bot, after all.  But then what am I doing, other than throwing around near-worthless tips while hypothetically bloating the block chain?
Isn't it better to tip when you truly believe somebody deserves a tip, and then make that tip count, rather than the plethora of "lulz, here, have a SteveCoin tip!"?
( Note also that *some* of these altcoins have a strong charity mindset and for at least one of them, several *pages* of results were tips in the form of giveaways and charity donations.  Can these truly be considered tips? )

Overall: No, because the difficulty adjusts based on the network's hash rate*
However: If you manage to get very fast hardware *before* the network responds to that, and preferably *just after* the difficulty was last adjusted, you would get faster confirmations.  But only until the next difficulty adjustment.
\* technically, based on how long it took for miners to mine 2016 blocks.

You reveal the public key when you spend from an address, not the private key.  While this does reduce security, and there are other good reasons not to re-use an address, it does not mean that as soon as you spend from an address anybody else can do so, too.

I actually never looked at whether there's a skew toward address lengths, but considering you have to start out with a private key to hash, the length of the target hash doesn't really matter too much.  I'd imagine the comparison would be very very very slightly faster, but that comparison check is dwarfed by the key generation and hashing code, and it would seem silly to compare only to the shorter addresses when there's an (assumed) equal chance of colliding with a longer one :)

Is it *their* hardware, or did they rent the hardware from the company in question?
If the former - big deal, unethical, probably a breach of contract (depends on the contract closed) and quite possibly illegal.
If the latter - not so much, depending on whether or not the effect of said mining causes a breach of contract.  E.g. if you rent out a bunch of machines and you pretty much only offer disk, network I/O, RAM and some CPU cores, but don't specify how much of those CPU cores except that they'll be plenty to handle being e.g. a web server that sees the odd CPU spike, and the system in question defers CPU to the client's VM/processes when needed, then there isn't really any impact on the client's stuff at all.
I'd still say it's probably not *wise*, regardless.  But 'big deal'-wise, it really depends on the exact situation, contracts, etc.

Oh yeah, like I said - the technical aspect of the discussion was pretty good. (I say 'was', but I haven't listened to the part after the commercial break yet).
I'm just not a fan of the "This amount of time is worth this amount of money (IF I were actually billing for it and somebody were paying for it)".  That's the same line of thinking that yields things like "the economy could get a $50B boost if people lived 5 minutes closer to work" - because obviously people would work 10 minutes longer each day making money, rather than sleeping 5 minute longer or taking 5 minutes longer on a healthy breakfast or spending 5 minutes more with the kids, etc.  So in terms of 'setting up merged mining costs me more in time than it yields', I'm skeptical - it's a trade-off that's usually made with other things, not with billable hours. E.g. I could watch a movie OR I could set up merged mining.  One yields entertainment (hopefully), the other yields some altcoin (again, hopefully).  Which would I rather have?  That's what it usually comes down to - not a monetary amount - otherwise we'd all be trying to work 20-hour days with 1-hour powernaps 4 times a day ;)

They need only trust themselves (and their prowess at being able to network computers together).  If anything, using Bitcoin internally would be much less efficient than what they've got.

I think you'll find that most companies in fact don't give projected dates unless they are, in fact, already 100% certain that they can deliver.  If they aren't 100% certain, but they want to give a projected date anyway, it'll be "expected ...", or - especially in financial statements - something a bit more vague like "tba Q3 ..."
While I agree that it's probably healthier to not hold companies too strictly to release dates if they should mention them - let alone be legally accountable - weeks/months passing by without a good reason for the delay without much chance of even getting your money back, should certainly be grounds for investigation.

you would first have to define exactly what '1 calc' is.  Addition/subtraction only?
After that, all you have to determine is how many calculations are in a single attempt to solve a block.  That will be your best case scenario: getting a solve at the very first attempt.  It's unlikely, but not impossible.
Note that IF the total time ends up being greater than, say, 20 minutes - they could very well solve the block, but they wouldn't have mined it.. as a computer will almost certainly have beaten them to it.

No, Bitcoin is primarily an algorithm and protocol specification - along with the name for 1 unit of 'mined' units.  That specification does see updates once in a while, by community developers, but those updates are rare for the very reason that they have to be tested thoroughly to see what impact it has.  Most of these updates don't really change the underlying Bitcoin specifications, but rather build upon it.
For the end-user you're thinking more of Bitcoin *clients*.  Those do see updates pretty frequently, but more in term of features like more efficient mining on given hardware platforms, or in terms of managing Bitcoin wallets, prettier UI, etc.  If and when an update to the main Bitcoin 'way of doing things' is made, Bitcoin client developers can choose to either adhere to it, or ignore it.
Take for example the decision made a while back to limit 'dust' (transactions that would only send tiny fractions of a bitcoin to the point where they really just cluttered things up rather than contributing).  This was not a decision on the Bitcoin specification level, nor was it anything that was added to the protocol.  Rather, the developers of the main popular Bitcoin clients added a bit of code in their clients ([generally from the base code]( that limited such 'dust' transactions.  Of course some of those clients let you override that setting, and other clients still never added that limit to begin with.
Another example would be [BIP32]( which has not found widespread adoption yet.

If it's just a server farm on its own - similar to computational farms like that of Amaon's, or the massive renderfarms used for today's visual effects-ridden movies - then...those don't really face a public internet.
Of course if you DDoS the node that talks to the internet to submit results/etc., that you can DDoS.  And if you do that effectively enough, it doesn't matter if they mine faster than anybody else, as they can't get their results out before that 'anybody else' does.
The farm itself will happily continue crunching numbers, though.

That's correct - you can only use it to mine coins that use the same hashing functions as Bitcoin.  Even if another coin does SHA256, if it does it singly, or triple, it's still no good.
If it's currently just wasting space, I'd check if the guy who wants to build a bitcoin mining hardware museum (I forget the name, I'm sure Google can help) has one already.
The only alternative that makes any sense that I can think of is to strip it apart for parts.  There's still a fairly decent heatsink on there, the case itself is nice and small that could be used for a project, etc.  On the board might be some chips and parts that you could salvage if board (the microcontroller, say - but you can get those for a few bucks as it is, the power jack would have been good if you still had a working power supply), but otherwise that's pretty much the least worthy thing in there.

1. Yes and yes.  Most random number generators will, eventually, cover all possibilities that are within the reach of that random number generator.  I.e. if I asked you to pick a random number between 1 and 10 inclusive a million times, odds are you'll hit numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 eventually.  You won't have hit number 4.31278 or 7.31278, etc. though.  This crosses over to question 2.  As far as bias goes, as long as it's just a bias (let's say you pick numbers 5-10 twice as often as numbers 1-4) you'll still, eventually, cover the entire spread.  Not having any bias is key to a good RNG, though, and there's plenty of tools that allow you to check bias of output up to a certain confidence pretty well.  Analysis of the actual function and the platform it runs on should be able to tell you more exactly whether there's bias.
2. No, no minimum.  Who would enforce this anyway? (answer: the users, presuming they find out that the generator used is crap; see e.g. the Android RNG issue fixed quite a while ago).  I'd imagine that the reference software uses pretty a good RNG.
3. As a result of 2: yes.  I could make a wallet that has a 'float random { return 1.0; }' function and it would be crap.  By definition, that means that one that returns either a 0 or a 1 is already better, albeit still crap.
4. A private key on its own is very secure, pretty much the theoretical.  A sequence of private keys generated by the same software (or potentially even on the same device) may have decreasing security if the RNG is crap.  See again the Android RNG issue fixed quite a while ago.
5. Google should be able to tell you that.  Of course I can always generate the same address twice if I give it the same input twice (say you use a wallet generator that takes a pass phrase, and ONLY a passphrase... and then you use the same pass phrase twice. derp?)  But that would be a pretty crap generator.  Even in the Android RNG issue I don't think there was an address generated twice.
Counter-questions: why are you mixing up pseudo and quasi, wallet and address, and how does all this apply to doge?

The reason why I think it will remain an issue is because with only 2, 3, even 5 'major' players - there's always a very real danger of collusion.  Think of computer memory makers, harddisk manufacturers, TV manufacturers and many others that get fined either in the EU or the US because they made secret agreements over price, territory, etc. with none of the general public being any the wiser until it's too late.  So say you've got 5 major parties, each holding about 15% of the market with the remainder going to minor parties/p2pool types and solo miners.  Only 3 of them have to have a coffee together at a trade show and make some underhanded deals for them to be able to actually try and sneak a few things to make it worth their while.  We, on the other hand, would still be saying "it's all good, nobody has anywhere near 51%".

Now to answer the questions at this branch...  


Not that I know of, but that's the sort of service I was referring to.


It's due to the way transactions are confirmed.  'miners' are essentially asked to roll a dice and get a number below, say, 2.  Sometimes you'll get 1/2 on the first roll, other times - if you're very unlucky - you might need a hundred rolls.  


Yes and no - I'd say read this thread:

And you propose that they would halt the sales of bitcoin miners... how, exactly?
And said halting of miner sales would affect confidence how, exactly?  Considering it would simply maintain the status quo (at least until hardware failures veeeeeeeeeery slooooooooowly reduce the total hash rate of the network).
Besides, who says Satoshi Nakamoto made bitcoin for purposes of currency in the first place?  Maybe he/she/they simply realized that an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol in the form of a currency was the most sure-fire way of kindling an environment in which the idea would thrive - and have any success of that currency itself simply be a nice bonus.
@_date: 2014-02-01 15:43:37
It wouldn't necessarily lead to double spending, it just opens the opportunity to do so with a 100% success rate.  You can do it with less than 51%, but the success rate goes down as well.
If people can double-spend (i.e. pay somebody, have them be convinced they got paid, but then pay somebody else with the exact same bitcoins (as it were) and null and void the earlier payment), you can't be sure that any payment from them is ever going to be on the up-and-up.
That doesn't mean that they *will* double-spend, but you'd have to put your trust in them.. and it's best not to have to trust.
If enough people don't trust it, and start thinking 'omg omg the money sent here could be null and void moments later', then loss of faith of occurs.
Loss of faith always means a drop in price; see e.g. Nintendo stock.  Whether that would be a 'catastrophic' drop is something that depends on how many people keep faith (e.g. trust the party not to perform double spends).

"So if Bitcoin is not a currency, will we still need money transmitter licenses to exchange them in the USA?" - 
Anybody knowledgeable enough to figure out what the deal is there?  Are they simply going to treat it as 'money' when considering exchanges and properties when considering taxes.. or is there some other license that one would have to adhere to?
I have heard this ruling be compared to gold (in which case it depends on the state/etc., and usually is a very specific license required for precious metals/gemstones in order to combat people selling stolen goods) and compared to stock (in which case that's a whole world of regulations).

@_date: 2014-02-21 00:35:00
The best resource is the blockchain itself.
'accounts' is difficult to even guesstimate, since there really is no good indication of how many addresses there are per agent.
Even if you take address == agent, then there's no good indication of how many are 'active'.  You'd have to define 'active' first; many people define it as those addresses for which the private key is known to at least 1 person, others may define it as 'having seen a transaction to it / out of it in the past N months'.  The latter can be determined, the former cannot.
Transactions globally is easy - the blockchain is the global ledger.  The transactions/day can easily be found, at least as a 'past 24 hours' number:  .  I'm sure there's a nice graphed version somewhere.

1. The requesting party would generate a private key, store it safely, and provide the service with the public key.  These keys are temporary.
2. The service would then generate a private key of their own, and combine their public key with the requesting party's public key.
3. The result is a new public key which, when hashed as usual, provides an address.
4. The service would then fund that address.
5. Then the service sends their private key to the requesting party.
6. The requesting party would then combine the supplied private key with their private key, yielding a new private key.
It is only that last private key that allows you to spend from the funded address.  Thus the service need never be trusted.
Of course, as jcoinner points out, if it's to be an address to be mined straight into anyway, they might as well accept an address - any address - from the requesting party.  Certainly simpler :)

The metric on blockchain.info is the average transaction confirmation time, rather than block confirmation time (unless they changed that, coinciding with v0.9.0 release).  v0.9.0 changed several things regarding transactions, including the minimum fee.  Assume some clients always sent a 'too low' fee, causing transactions to take a long time to even get included in a block - that would inflate the transaction confirmation time.  But with the lower fees, those clients' 'too low' fee is suddenly perfectly valid, the transaction gets included in a block sooner, and thus the transaction confirmation time goes down.
That, at least, is the leading theory until blockchain.info responds ;)

Basically here's the rub with brain wallets - the pass phrase you use is used to generate one or more private keys (depending on exact implementation).  Those private keys have associated public keys.  Those public keys have associated addresses.  
All of these steps are one way.  I.e. you can go:  phrase &gt; private key &gt; public key &gt; address  
But you can't go: address &gt; public key &gt; private key &gt; phrase.  
If you could, at any one of these points, there would be trouble.
So let's say all an attacker has is an address which has a lot of Bitcoin in it and looks like a juicy target. The only way they can attack that is by attacking the private key - the item at the top - and then calculate the public key and address from that.  
( If Bitcoin were spent from that address, they could skip the last step, and compare against the then-known public key. )  
For most things, this is going to be infeasible, as the addresses tend to be generated in clients using sufficiently random numbers that the only way to perform the attack is using brute force.  You can read elsewhere just how pointless that is :)  
But when you're using a brain wallet, you're putting something new at the top - a pass phrase.  Suddenly, rather than a lengthy string of random characters to attack with brute force, they can try a dictionary attack against the pass phrase - a much simpler proposition.  They would still have to calculate down to the public key / address, but the search space has been reduced significantly enough that it becomes feasible, especially if the pass phrase is a simple one.  
Thus why, in my reply, I noted that you would have to make the pass phrase sufficiently lengthy or intricate that most attacks would fail.  But the longer / more intricate you make it, the more likely it is that you won't remember it correctly.  Oops.  
So another approach is to keep the pass phrase simple, and make it intricate using a hashing function.  This only gives you 1 more thing to remember - the hashing function used - while making it much, much more difficult for an attacker to approach it.
Let's say you've got a simple passphrase:  
*this is my passphrase there are many others like it but this one is mine*
Now, this is already on the lengthy side, and somebody using dictionary attacks is probably going to go for the low-hanging fruit (people using only 4 words, say) first.  But now let's hash that using a hashing function:  
Now the thing at the top is still a 'passphrase' - but one that is not vulnerable to straight dictionary attacks.  You could just as well have used "this is my passphrase", for which the hash is "5357ce178733552b1176d4306ec2b15df823bc57a9679a96f6dab3cd1c7ca8c3".
The attacker would have to consider the possibility that you hashed your pass phrase, and figure out which hashing function you used.  In this case, that's SHA-256, but keep in mind that from the public key / address alone, they can't know that.  You could use SHA1, Keccak, Groestl, etc.  
So it's something that they would have to anticipate out of the blue - unless a *lot* of people start SHA-256'ing their pass phrases before actually using the result as a pass phrase, because them it becomes expected.
To note on that - let's say a lot of people do start doing that, and you say "well then I'll just switch to a combination of SHA-256 and Scrypt, problem solved!"  But now you've got two additional things to remember, and you've only moved the milepost.  
So while what I suggest certainly increases the security of a brain wallet type setup, the very concept means that it will always be less secure than a completely randomly generated set of keys / seed (if generating multiple keys), and storing that key securely somewhere, somehow, completely disconnected from the Bitcoin network in every which way.

Check a mining calculator.  If it says it's majorly profitable for you tomorrow - not 'in 6 months', but tomorrow - then that should be a no-brainer.
Otherwise, you'd have to consider whether the exchange rate goes up or down.  If it's only barely profitable and the exchange rate goes down, that 'barely profitable' becomes 'not profitable'.  Conversely, if it's not really profitable now, but for some reason the exchange rate goes way up, it could become profitable again.  Of course 'in time' the difficulty also goes up, etc. etc.
It's a risk you'd take, and should only take if essentially losing that $7.5k is something you think you'd laugh about over a beer.

I can understand that they would be pissed, but that is one of the risks you take when you use the non-native currency.  I'm not just talking about Bitcoin here.
Let's say I bought that fridge from you 6 months ago, paying with my credit card.  I pay you $1200 - but I'm from Europe, so I'm actually incurring a hit of $1200 * 0.7651 = €918.  But it catches fire and is a total loss. Given the option of a replacement model or my money back, I opt for the money back option.  Today, the exchange rate is 0.7350.  So, do I now only get €882 back?  That's €36 I'm out.  Disappeared into thin air.  Should I force you to pay me back $1249 instead under the threat of going to the BBB with a complaint?
Whatever your thoughts are on this matter, should apply equally to Bitcoin.
( And yes, I understand that my beef would probably actually be with my credit card company - but a similar concept applies to the Bitpay case, as they are the ones setting the rate at purchase, at Bitpay does have refund procedures available as well, in both Bitcoin or Local Currency amounts matching that at payment. )

That's some impassioned writing style their lawyers (geeze, I sure hope their lawyers actually wrote that) have there.
Interesting approach, too - citing previous cases in which a projected release date was given, ended up being late (4 months), and plaintiffs' complaint dismissed because the projected release date is essentially immaterial to the law.
They then call upon these cases in defending themselves for repeatedly making projected release date statements that continually kept getting pushed back further and further, by saying that because of those statements, customers were actually better informed than those in the cited cases.
Sadly, the court might just go along with that - even though this sets things up for any pre-order model where you just keep pushing release dates back and back and back, all the while claiming there's no refund option available because you WILL deliver at some point, until, eventually, the whole thing of course collapses.

Agreed.. this is probably the most controversial part, for two reasons:
1. It is pseudonymous, which is close enough to being anonymous that it *is* used for a lot of nefarious things - be that organized crime payments, somebody's fiver bag, or ransomware payments.
2. It is pseudonymous, which is far enough from being anonymous that casual payments, given an interested enough actor, can be led back to individuals - while a lot of people think that Bitcoin is actually *anonymous* and are thus inclined to be casual about it, effectively aiding such an actor.

I don't know how you figure 'up until block 72499', given that block 72498 already defies your observation.
72499 - and many others like it, such as 72504 - does not contain any transactions *other than* the coinbase transaction, however.  What does the specification say about that situation? :)
@_date: 2014-08-27 16:40:34
You'll have to specify which part you're interested in.
Obviously [Protocol Specification]( which goes over most everything, but not in detail with regard to must/must not/may/may not on inputs, edge cases, etc. which is what you'd really want for a formal specification.  It also doesn't cover e.g. mining pools (stratum and the data they deal with - something that's plaguing the use of the new AsicMiner Tubes with some pools, as they reject its straight output).
Then there's [Bitcoin Protocol Specification by Krzysztof Okupski]( work, which definitely goes further.
There's also the [step-by-step overview of making a transaction by Ken Shirriff]( but that should serve more as a "oh that's what the specification meant to say?" thing.
Then there's [Formalising The Bitcoin Protocol by W.J.B. Beukema]( which sets out an mCRL2 definition for the network/transactions part of Bitcoin.
But if you're asking whether there's any progress toward getting an IETF RFC or even something along the lines of an ISO standard - I'd say "I don't think so".  As it is, things are still fairly in flux - just look at all the work that went into 0.9.2(.1), and that's just 3 months ago.  While they could start up a formal specification, odds are they'd have to write up addenda and/or obsolete it not long after.

You're silly because...
1. "while Doge community sleeps!" is patently false, as is made obvious by that article.
2. Guess why there's a trademark for 'Dove' as a chocolate, and a trademark for 'Dove' as a beauty supplies brand.  Hint: it has to do with them being in completely different markets.
3. "give up their own trademark" - the Dogecoin community actually has no trademark.  The entire use of the Doge name stemming from a Doge meme itself is a form of usurping that, while generally shrugged off due to its nature in use, endows scant few legal protections.  If anything, the original photographer of the dog that inspired the Doge meme would have legal standing as the entire meme is effectively derivative artwork.  Ultra-Pro apparently has squared away any issues on that front, according to  .
4. Stemming from point 1: there's plenty of time and opportunity for  filing complaints, such as the narrowing of the trademark application's area of use, or file for full dismissal and denial.

Unfortunately, most of these are not actually miners.  I'd be surprised if they're even proper flash storage (and not claiming to be 16GB, but quietly rolling over ever 2GB).
@_date: 2014-06-28 17:00:57
A common issue is this:
P2Pool more or less has a separate block chain in order to deduce shares each miner contributes to the mining process.
The time between these blocks is very low - I think somebody said it was 10 seconds.
Bitfury miners (I don't know if it's inherent to the chip, or only to the hardware built around the chips) can't be told to quit working on a particular unit of work and instead start a new one.
So say that it's being told to work on job 1, and it's expected to take a few minutes.  But then job 2 comes in 10 seconds later.  The miner is still going to be working on job 1 for a few minutes.  When it's done, it claims to the network "look! I finished job 1", and the network goes "well isn't that adorable - but you're too late and we have to consider this a stale share."
However, that shouldn't actually be a problem with P2Pool, as long as everybody has pretty much the same stale share percentage (lower network latency may affect that) the payout is still going to be distributed according to hashing power.
So, my guess is that they're actually seeing something more specific to the mining product they have, and hopefully they can fix it either on the host side, or with firmware updates, or in collaboration with the P2Pool developers.  
Edit: Such as: 
Otherwise, it'll have to be another poll on which pool(s) to switch to.

I know, I know, broccoli and cauliflower are perhaps not everybody's favorites, but you just bought some with Bitcoin because the fruit&amp;veggies place decided to accept Bitcoin (even if it's just to get their name in the local gazette), and you're already done eating the rosettes as a healthy alternative snack food, so you're left with those the stalks.  They don't seem very appetizing - and they're not.  But did you know you can make a great soup with them?  No, this doesn't even involve cheese.
Here's what you need:  
A bit of butter - toss that into a pot (not a frying pan - a pot!), and let melt until hot (but don't burn it!).  
A small onion - diced.  A clove of garlic - minced.  Throw those in there, let fry on medium heat until translucent.
In them mean time, take your left-over broccoli and/or cauliflower stalks - wash them, cut off the dried out ends (usually the bottom), and dice.  Take a potato, dice.  Grab some chicken stock - the good kind, with chunks of chicken - and pour that into the pot, strained through the lid, once the onion and garlic is ready, bring to a boil.  
Once boiling, toss the potato and leftover broccoli and cauliflower in there, reduce to near-boiling.  Leave for a good 8-10 minutes at least until the broccoli and cauliflower bits are well-cooked.
Now get out your hand-held blender, and blend it all up.  Add some (sour) cream to the mix until it has a nice rich taste, but you don't want to overpower the broccoli/cauliflower.  Season (pepper, salt) to taste, and stir that in, along with the pieces of chicken from the chicken stock (now you know why we didn't add those before - blended chicken? ew!).
Bring to a boil again - this will help thicken the soup later on - and once boiling, take off heat, and serve.
Beware, this soup is a thick soup, and can remain hot for quite a long time.  So while you wait for it to cool down, or are eating it, think carefully on whether you want to down vote this positive and useful comment.

A lot of people interested in Bitcoin really don't care too much about knowing whether or not it went up a tenth of a point in the last 5 minutes, and if there's a major price swing it will end up as a submission anyway.  To them it would just be unnecessary clutter on an otherwise fairly clean subreddit.
Those who *do* care about having a ticker tend to be the ones who want to have such information at all times, and will install a browser extension or an external application so that they needn't even be on in order to see it.

Well I suppose people full of hot air are contributing to global warming.
But really, 'Bitcoin' isn't a centralized thing that would be hit by a single blackout.  Even if the whole world would lose electricity entirely - and by that I mean that you couldn't even power your miner and any required internet infrastructure through e.g. isolated solar - Bitcoin would continue to exist and function on the same level as any other currency; since no modern currency can really 'work' as a means of exchange without electricity at this point.  You could argue that you could still use dollars as a barter exchange medium, but I think it's pretty ill-suited to the purpose given the ease with which it is counterfeited and without the automated checks in place to remove such counterfeit money from circulation.
Oh, and again not upworthy enough.  You needed to write something like "Mother Nature has it in for Bitcoin and here's why".

Interesting how Amazon's complaints are far better worded.  In fact, in Walmart's referencing the NY State definition of a gift card, there's nothing that would preclude the inherent value of that card to swing well beyond inflation/deflation and that of market trends.  I.e. a company could issue a card with 10 BusinessBucks for $10, and 2 years later decide that 10 BusinessBucks are only worth $5.
Amazon's complaint -  - makes a far more stringent definition that would specifically relate to ties to fiat amounts.
Admittedly, Walmart's complaint looks more like some internal legal department back-and-forth than a formal filed complaint.

Given that the odds that you'd find something like that in America is greater than that you'd find something like that local, you'd have to keep in mind the shipping costs.
I would recommend looking up a local sign maker - they really don't care what you want to put on them, as long as you can give them files they can use.  You can find some material at  or you can google around for "bitcoin svg" and/or "bitcoin ai" (adobe illustrator).. any respectable sign maker should know what to do with those.  The QR code you can just provide as a regular bitmap (as it's just squares anyway) - they should have the tools to turn that into vector themselves, if needed.
Good luck!

Of course they skim money, that's part of the contract ;)
How can they be sure they don't skim extra on top of that?  They can't.  Although they could technically query some exchanges / price indices and see if what the payment processor is returning 'seems' okay, there's always a chance that they skim an extra 0.01% and fall well within the margins of error.  You'd need a very large number of sample points to derive that they are skimming extra off the top.
Ultimately, they just have to trust payment processor to not screw them over - and payment processors know that *if* somebody did get wise to any extra skimming, they could be facing severe legal complaints (not to mention that most merchants would be likely to drop them).
@_date: 2014-02-19 02:28:51
Not sure if you need opinions, per se.  Just do the math - enter the stats into any bitcoin mining calculator.  For example, using [mining.thegenesisblock.com](  
* Enter the hash rate
* Enter your contract's price as the cost of hardware
* Zero out everything about power use, cost of power, shipping, etc. as these do not apply
* Play with the conversion rate.  Difficulty tends to be pretty well-calculated.
Silver plan: 30GH, $999, even if the exchange rate were $1,000/BTC, you'd be looking at a loss of about $620 after a year.  After that you'd have to renew your contract.  
Gold plan: 140GH, $3999: $2260 loss.  
Platinum plan: 350GH, $8,999: $4650 loss.
Of course, you could be very optimistic.  Maybe it'll bump up to $2,000/BTC.  Still more than $200 loss on the Platinum plan.
Okay, but maybe the difficulty will magically stall and stay at the current level.  There you go, now you stand to make some profit even at the current exchange rate.  $3700 after a year.  On the Platinum plan, that is.  $1080 on gold and $89 on silver.
Oh, and that's not mentioning that right now they're using a wildly lower exchange rate ($407.72/BTC vs bitcoinaverage's $627.1/BTC) *and* a bitcointalk thread mentioned that they take 10%.

Ahhh, well.. once upon a time I had a wonderful spreadsheet that allowed you to check at current values as well as several projections, and pop out exactly what sort of rigs were worth the bother.  It died and thanks to the ever-changing landscape of mining rigs, actual delivery times, etc. I never bothered to re-create it.
However, you can still somewhat get the same using a number of online mining calculators.  Most of the work would be in figuring out what a rig is going to cost you, how fast it's going to be, how much energy it uses up (and how much energy that costs), and when it will be delivered (and at what cost).  Plus, in your case, your rack costs.
If you have those numbers, you can just drop them into such a calculator, mess with things like the difficulty and exchange rates, and easily see how good, or bad, the risk you take can play out.  The 'mess with things' bit is where it's a gamble, though.
Suffice to say though that unless you've got several thousand to throw at it, it doesn't make sense from a monetary viewpoint.

If this is a thought experiment... well I guess I'll go along with it.
Considering the buyer can never be sure that the private key was not compromised in any way (you certainly wouldn't be able to show it to any prospective buyer without covering up that key) and at least has 100% certainty that the artist, handler, etc. have had access to that key, then upon buying the piece the buyer would have to immediately transfer the Bitcoin to a different address; that's assuming one of the aforementioned parties doesn't do so before them.  Once the amount has been transferred, the address being in the 'art'work becomes merely a curiosity, as it no longer contains the amount that the work is purported to be worth.

Also, see ButterflySammy's comment, which is actually echo'd in e.g. the DogeCoin community.. present the price, and people will start focusing on that price (for better or, inevitably, for worse).

See the 'see also'?
Let me clarify... they are capable of forming an alternative blockchain that is longer than the 'normal' block chain.
While they can't affect that normal block chain, *their* blockchain being longer means that it ends up getting selected as the 'normal' block chain.
So let's say you make a transaction and that gets included in block 100.  They start their chain at block 95, and they never include your transaction.  Come block, say, 120, they decide to let 'their' block chain loose on the network.  The nodes notice that it is longer, and adopt it in favor of the shorter block chain.  Your transaction just disappeared.
Now, if this happens people could quickly (try to) put things to a stop, release new clients with a checkpoint that effectively dictates that the shorter block chain is the valid one and reject the other one, etc.  But by then it's already too late for certain types of transactions.  Checkpoints are usually only added when they're very well-established.  E.g. the latest in the reference client is at block 279,000, from January 6th 2014.

No.  I'm concerned that you may not even have read the article.
They're talking about when a computer re-uses the same key (in their scenario, to decrypt messages), then using specially crafted input, and literally listening to the noise made by the machine, they can figure out what the key is.
The problem in mining is that you actually don't know what the key is and have to generate metric umpteenumpteensingtons of them before you get one that is valid.  Once done, that's that.  You can't re-use that in any way.  Listening on this process is... well maybe it makes for a great track if slowed down, but certainly wouldn't aid in mining in any way.

Correctly constructed payment requests include the amount (and, often, a comment so later on you know wtf the payment was for)


Well you don't *have to*.  Most businesses prefer to do so because of the slight chance that it ends up getting orphaned or there's a '51%' attack, etc. etc.  If it were in their best interest to just take the money and eat the loss (you did say 'a cup of coffee', so that's not exactly that much... most Starbucks lose dozens of cups of coffee a day because a customer reneges on their verbal contract and will state they actually ordered Y when really they ordered X (and the security footage would prove as much, but who wants to mess with that AND get an irate customer?)), they would wait at best for the transaction to be broadcast.


Oh, man.  First you have to get out your wallet, then you have to read out or listen for the amount (and if it's a busy store or the person telling you how much it is has a heavy accent (like, say, Irish)), then you find out that the amount is $2.49 but screw it you don't have $2.49 exactly, you don't even have $2 and 2 quarters, but you have a $10, will that do?  Oh wait, there was a $5 behind the $10s (how did that happen!?), let's give them that instead, then they're hitting it up in their machine and the change is $2.51 but dangit they *just* tossed all the pennies in the penny jar, would you accept $2.50?  Screw that, you want your $0.01, so now they have to go to the back and get that roll of pennies out and...  
Okay, that might have gotten a bit contrived toward the end, but you get the idea.  Most of these 'cons' apply to cash transactions as well.  There's better cons to be pointed to :)
The other bit, though, is entirely true.  Thinking merchants would deal directly in Bitcoin is almost as much a pipedream as thinking they would deal directly in Euros (if we're talking U.S. merchants) or in Dollars (if we're talking Euro-aligned European merchants).  Perhaps even more so, as the exchange rate isn't nearly as volatile.

On to the topic at hand, yadda yadda yadda "we told you so" yadda yadda we must destroy pools for the safety of the network.  People mining, unless they have a powerful farm to begin with, be damned.  Oh, and we're only assuming that when people who pay for hosted mining can't verify they're actually being paid out what they should be having paid out (which I call into question, but let's roll with it), that they would be happier with, well, nothing? I guess?  Not sure what the alternative is, there.
It would be a fine patch from a technological viewpoint, a horrible patch from a psychological viewpoint, and an ultimately flawed patch from an ecosystem viewpoint.  If there is to be a hard fork, it might as well actually fix the causes, rather than treating the symptoms.

Of course you don't really have to inquire.  If you know for a fact* that they take Bitcoin, feel free to add the business to OpenStreetMap or, if they're already on there, add the payment:bitcoin = yes tag.

The computations are needed to verify that every entry in the ledger is valid.  If the computations weren't done, then I could put an entry in the ledger that gives me $1,000,000 (or equivalent in Bitcoin) and run off.
And yes, that's it.  That's all there is to it.  It won't help find aliens, cure cancer, find flight MH370, make drug companies richer than they already are, or create magical unicorns.
There are other uses being considered for the blockchain - and some already exist - but the computation itself is always just to verify the integrity of the blockchain.

When shipping items, the declared value is typically required in a major fiat currency.  Our shipping slips allow for EUR and USD, for example.
Assume, for whatever reason, they allowed one to put BTC on there.  Nothing would really change.  If it's over a certain threshold, it's more likely to get inspected, and if it gets inspected they'll rate the contents according to existing systems, and applies tariffs as usual.
Now, if you were a shipper asking this question with regard to the value declared vs the actual value, keeping in mind the volatility could cause under-declaration of value.. that would be a good question :)

That's a shame.  To remove them from Coinmap, you'd have to go to its openstreetmap node (click on it in Coinmap, hit the little asterisk beside their name), then in the node's tag list remove the "payment:bitcoin" tag.  Should update automatically in Coinmap (might take a bit for the change to be made public).
Edit: And just to add.. yeah, this is why I mentioned to double-check.  Wouldn't be the first place to have a tech-savvy employee that gets them going on it, then either results aren't as good as hoped or the employee moves on, and there goes the BTC support :)  It would help if their websites were more informative.  EVR also doesn't have this information on their website.  The only reason to even know about it is because their name is frequently mentioned in articles about Bitcoin in the NYC region.

Given a complicated enough transmutation scheme, a work of Shakespeare can be turned into a child pornography JPEG.  So the question is.. while that sort of material *can* be stored in the blockchain (probably required to be across multiple blocks) does the blockchain thus contain child pornography, or does it only contain data which, when combined in a particular way, results in child pornography?
The same applies to that first illegal prime - it is not in itself the DeCSS code.. you have to actually interpret the number via another program to get that DeCSS code, and the second one - which requires a specific architecture to run.
Even if something illegal were to appear in the blockchain 'as is' - let's say it's defamation in plaintext - I think the courts would appreciate the impossibility of culling this information from every single copy by way of e.g. hiding the data for a blacklist of blocks (while still including it for the sake of the technical underpinnings).  If nothing else, it might be easier to trace to the source (who should then be dealt with) than a random anonymous posting on the internet.

Communicating with you seems to do that all on its own :)
I'll just give it one more shot, though.
You're only thinking of Bitcoin-the-currency.  That's fine, most people here do because they were hoping to make a quick buck while others are hoping to watch it all come crashing down on them and get a good ol' "I told you so!".
That currency however is based on several technological premises (Bitcoin-the-technology) which are building blocks for other things. Primarily the trustless decentralized public ledger aspect was a problem that wasn't satisfyingly solved in the past.  Bitcoin solves that - or at least is the best stab at it so far and is a great leap from what came before.  With that in place, and the building blocks in hand, things like a multi-signature address were made possible.
An example I gave in another thread was that the IOC (International Olympic Comittee), a sports arbitration committee, and an athlete could have signatures to a 2-of-3 address.  The public ledger would record that the athlete had won a medal.  If the IOC suspects drug use, and the arbitration committee agrees, their signatures alone would be sufficient to revoke the medal.  The athlete on their own can't 'sell' that medal.  If the athlete wants to donate it, and the arbitration committee agrees with it even if the IOC says 'no', there's nothing the IOC can do.  The public ledger would also irrevocably show that revoking, donation, etc.  
Now, is that a practical example?  No.  Who would want some tag on a bitcoin address rather than a shiny plated medal they could show off in photos?  But it is the type of thing that can be done in similar situations - contracts, deeds, etc.  
There's really quite a bit of information out there on the ramifications of Bitcoin-the-technology.  But if you're only focused on Bitcoin-the-currency, then you're right, there's very little it solves there at this time and (imho) introduces quite a few new problems.  But the currency is not all there is to Bitcoin :)

The current exchange rate is all that matters if one goes by fiat, whereas the BTC amount is all that matters if one goes by BTC.
In your neighboring comment, you point out that if they had delivered early, the guy might have generated 'only 8 BTC', but due to the $1000USD/BTC exchange rate, that would still be a $3,800 potential profit.  Except, of course, that's still a 35 - 8 = 27BTC loss, and holding the 35BTC would have given a $30,800 potential profit at that time.
Note that I say potential (aka paper) profit, because unless he'd actually go to an exchange, it would not have been realized profit.  The 27BTC loss, on the other hand, would be a realized loss no matter which way one looks at it.
( Of course, if the $4200 figure is also just potential,and he actually bought the 35BTC back when it was $1/BTC... )

tl;dr: Bitcoin has a high transaction cost because it doesn't, but buying Bitcoin and selling Bitcoin induces slippage.  Which I'm just going to say is part of the transaction cost.  Because reasons.   Even if you already hold Bitcoin.  And even if the recipient never sells the Bitcoin.  Reasons.
something something cyber thieves.
Next up: Bitcoin has a high transaction cost because all those computers performing the calculations necessary to confirm a transaction had an initial cost, use up energy, use bandwidth, etc. which all also add up to a cost.  Which is not factored directly into the actual transaction.  But which I'm going to say is part of the transaction cost anyway.  Because reasons.
Crap, forgot to make some parts bold.

There's any number of ways you can bring it out - having red/green enabled actually doesn't do much in the way of obfuscating it.  I can certainly see it even by just looking at the image as is.
( Just for kicks:  )
However, the choice of blue is important, because the human eye is much more susceptible to changes in the color green.  
(   )
In addition, many cheap displays don't even do full 8 bit per channel, opting instead to do a bastardized 16 bit format; 5:6:5 .  On such displays, a sufficiently dark blue color may not even show at all, getting dropped to black (most displays now use spatial or temporal dithering, though).  It also matters in terms of storage.. JPEGs, for example, also lose much more detail in blue and red than in green due to the color space transform which emphasizes greeens - meaning that your 'hidden text' is more likely to accidentally disappear.

It gets detected as a mining device by programs like cgminer (which can already use e.g. a GPU to perform mining).  cgminer instructs the USB device to start mining, sends it data, and receives data back from the USB device.  So you can stop it at any time simply by telling cgminer to quit.

It's pretty much the same as with KickStarter - they're just the site hosting the projects' crowdfunding campaign and do little vetting of the projects, and do not get involved in disputes should things go south.  They still take their % of the pledged amounts, of course.
In this case, it's a flexible funding campaign, too.  So if you pledge $100, that $100 is theirs - whether they make their goal amount or not.  You're quite literally just giving them $100 and telling them to go out, have fun, and not spend it all in one place.
Now.. technically, they should of course use the money for the project.  If they don't, you do have legal recourse.  But that's on you.  YOU would have to contact a lawyer and start a case.  They+you would then have to decide whether or not you've got enough people to make it a class action (because small claims is going to be nightmarish enough), to at least hit them where it hurts (don't expect to get (all) your money back - the lawyers will take a good chunk of however much you can squeeze out in the first place).
Plus, this is slated for the end of the year.  That's several difficulty adjustments away, with SpondooliesTech SP30s coming online along with a bunch of BE200-based machines, and BitFury got a nice injection of a few million so I would not be surprised at all if they put out a new chip design as well (yeah, there's already a Rev2 - but that was a rather minor incremental change.  I'd expect a node process change, at least).
That said... they at least put a fair bit of attention into their project's outline and the smallest of their miners that they're planning is only $50.  If you can stand to lose $50 (say you go on a diet for 2-4 weeks, depending on current eating habits... or just not go out for a fancy dinner with the SO for 1 night), then it's not exactly the end of the world.. and who knows, they just might deliver.

I'm not a lawyer, but I'd figure out how industry giants handle this.  I.e. use of Coca-Cola is prohibited pretty much everywhere, and while I seem to recall a trademark dispute between Ford and another 'Ford' (a garage? not sure) that ended up siding with that other 'Ford', you'd still need permission from Ford if you wanted to print their stuff onto merchandise.  They could call the merchandise 'Ford', but sticking the actual trademarked imagery, slogans, whatever on there would be a no-no.
Similarly, I'm curious how the people who filed for a 'bitcoin' trademark for barware are envisioning its use.  If they design a new shot glass and call it "The Bitcoin"... well, that's lame, but possibly okay.  If they just take a regular shot glass and slap a (trademarked, presumably) Bitcoin logo on there... well that's just merchandise, innit.
Looks like they're just going for the word 'BITCOIN', though.  I don't know how much trademark protection the actual trademark owners would get for that.
Again, I'm not a lawyer.

On the other hand, he does applaud the technology.  Thing is, Bitcoin *is* the technology.. what people do with it may well be worthy of the label 'con', but conflating the two doesn't do his already overt bias any favors.

in terms of apps' widgets.. A feature that you'd think they'd have, but apparently don't: balance (in BTC/USD) for a custom address, preferably with labeling option.
There's plenty that will tell you the current exchange rate.  There's some that will let you see the current balance in your wallet - with some demanding that you create a new wallet specifically for that app, because they also use it for actually making payments - but I have yet to find one that shows the current balance for a given address.  Instead I've got bookmarks on a screen that can be tapped and take me to blockchain.info .  I can easily sketch something up, but the code bit is beyond me (I should get into Android programming).

Great idea!
So when will this be?  I'd like to get my code and spreadsheets in order with date range checks to modify the display value of an underlying fractional value lest there's stuff in my ledger about how I got paid 1 Bitcoin (actually 0.001 Bitcoin) and sent 0.5 Bitcoin (actually 0.5 Bitcoin) in return - 'cos that would give me some headaches.  Also, would we be sticking to 1 Bitcoin = 0.001 Bitcoin, or are we going to move it around again if the value drops to the double digits / increases to the triple digits?  Actually, are there plans for a central repository for this type of information?  There is for regular currencies, and even for things like dates (calendar changes are fun), but as governments aren't done classifying Bitcoin as a currency when it benefits them and as something else when it benefits them yet, the Bitcoin ecosphere might have to set that up.

I actually don't mind people asking questions that have been answered time and again - what I mind is that apparently that information is not readily available to them to the point where asking the question all over again was, to them, the most practical way to get an answer.
Note that I also don't mind when other people then tell them to use the search field.

A. Sure, you first.

If your baker doesn't accept Bitcoin, find one that does.  Only if it's truly impossible or impractical, convert your Bitcoin back to fiat.)
B. What should we learn?  Tip less (per tip) and tip often?  While they're both cryptocurrency things, the communities are fairly different - so let them behave differently.

One felt that the company should be able to give those to a user in case they tragically lost it, the other felt it important that nobody but the user should have access to them - and if they lose access, well, it's on them for not keeping them safe.
There's something to be said for either approach, and it's good that users have a choice as to which approach they're more comfortable with using.

And no.  
Reason 1: the common usage for 'wallet' has become to refer to 1 or more addresses ('accounts') as a collection.  A bank account is just a single one.  
Reason 2: if you tell them it's an account, a lot of people are going to wonder how they 'log into' their account, as that's the common usage of 'account' on the interwebs.
I guess I'd have to wonder exactly how you explain it that they get turned off by it - especially when in your phrasing the 'it' seems to refer to 'hav(ing) to buy Bitcoin'... which would be unrelated to any term(s) chosen for wallets.

Bitcoin is a technology, and Bitcoin is a currency built onto that technology.  It doesn't 'use' anything.
Its users do, and mBTC and uBTC have been used here and there.  mBTC is actually fairly common ever since the USD/BTC rate hovered around 1000.
That said, there's plenty of users who would rather use what they label the 'bit', which is 1/1,000,000th of a BTC.  And then there's the smallest unit (currently) called a Satoshi, which is 1/100,000,000th of a BTC.
Either way you don't have to worry about there being 20 Bitshillings per BTC and 12 Satopennies per shilling or any such nonsense.

QR codes can easily fit inside 250x250, just resize them to that size. The bigger problem (though I didn't have any issue scanning that QR code - are you sure you used yours to begin with?  usually if some cell gets messed up the QR CRC will deal with it) is that the YouTube comment thread view actually uses pictures that are 48x48. 250 does not divide to 48 nicely.  Try resizing your QR code (without borders and without using a filter - if you see blurry edges, you're doing it wrong) to 240x240, then add a 5px border all around to make it 250x250, and see how that looks when resized to comment thread size by YT; hopefully it'll be a little sharper (since now every 5x5 pixels in your source image is simply 1 pixel in the thread image), and scan more easily.

More specifically, he suggests that public keys that are closer to rendezvous points are relatively weak (in that he claims he can essentially brute-force a private key out of it fairly quickly) and those further away are relatively strong.  The danger would lie in being able to find many more rendezvous points.  Though I think that eventually it would become a memory/database problem and wouldn't scale nicely since you'd have to check against every rendezvous point and compare to every target public key.  Still, it's intriguing.

That may be a short-term solution, but in the long term it just means that you're still concentrating a lot of hashing power at the hands of just a few; throwing money at them to invest in even more hashing power is providing the cement.  
While I've always held that this is likely to be the ultimate fate for Bitcoin mining anyway, a more appropriate alternative would be something like P2Pool.

Unless you wanted to mine for fun, that is :)
Note that almost no miner has positive ROI right now.  Just a few days ago I commented about CoinTerra's TerraMiner IV Batch 1 resolution (tl;dr: due to underperformance and late shipping they send 1 extra for free).
At the time (based on performance / power use figures cited and bitcoinaverage.com's index):  


With the new rate (drop after the whole MtGox, Russia, Apple thing), best is $700, worst is not even breaking even.  And this is for a miner that is vastly more powerful, and also many times more expensive.  
( These figures are snapshots with fairly linear assumptions about the future, rather than integration over actual known numbers and band projections.  Mining with these takes a large sum of money to be invested up front, and taking a bit of a gamble. )
But, if you just wanted to mine for fun, then the relatively cheap USB solutions are definitely a better option than using your GPU or CPU for the task.
If you did want to mine for money with a more modest setup, look at altcoins, especially altcoins that you could then try selling for Bitcoins.
Or, as GM4N1986 says.. just buy Bitcoin.  With the aforementioned drop, it hasn't been this cheap to buy some in quite a while.  It may drop further, it might go back up.  More gamble! :)

There are two readily apparent rather elegant solutions to this, with vastly different outcomes.
A. It remains profitable to increase global hashing power by throwing more hashing power into the system through being able to manufacture at a cost below the rewards through continuing advances in hashing speed and efficiency.  Unfortunately this race to the top will mean only the very wealthy can afford to do this, and even they will likely want to rent out the equipment rather than send it on over, to cut costs.  This consolidation of equipment into the hands of a small minority can lead to numerous issues, especially if some of those hands are ill-willed.
B. As the difficulty increases and miners see less and less returns, a portion will find themselves spending more on running the miner than they will get back.  These will go offline, thus reducing the global hashing rate, which in turn leads to a lower difficulty at which point they may or may not bring them back online.  Given the large number of individual miners at this time, I don't think you'd even notice this as an actual 'yo-yo effect', but more of a gradual deceleration of difficulty increase and eventual relative difficulty stability.

No, although this does depend on your definition of "affect".
Basically the entire point of a QR code is to be visible.  If you put it into a random image in a way that it doesn't affect the image in an appreciable manner, then by definition you're making it next to invisible, and thus impossible to scan.  Be that by making it very faint (scanning apps refuse to scan it), or through steganography (no actual QR code to scan unless it's run through a program that extracts it).
There's some tricks you can do, like interleaving a QR code's pixels with the image's pixels, which has a minimal impact on the image.  However, you can't scan it directly - it has to be scaled down on a computer, using a low quality scaling technique (e.g. 'take a pixel every 4th row and 4th column of pixels').  
Your best bet would indeed be to 'hide' it somewhere in the image where you can get away with it.  If you've got a sunset at a beach, you probably won't have any place to 'hide' it, unless you managed to catch some "no swimming" sign and decide to stick it on there.  In urban photography, you can probably drop it anywhere.  In photography of people's bodies, you might be able to drop it onto their skin as a fake tattoo.  All of these are still fairly marginal though, as they often require the QR code to be so tiny that at normal zoom levels, it would still be impossible to scan.
If you absolutely must include a QR code for whatever reason, you might as well be up front about it - drop it in the margin of the image, along with some plaintext, your name, copyright, etc. and don't worry about people cropping it out; determined people will remove it anyway.  Just make sure you upload a good resolution (not the highest) to some reputable image websites so that people who do care about finding the original can do so through e.g. Google's image search.

I'd think Satoshi would be impressed with the numerous altcoins, several of which have improvements on his/her/their work - though probably not so much with the ones that are actually centralized or that have been pre-mined considerably before public release.
If anything, the people originally behind Dogecoin would be ideologically pissed, since it was supposed to be a just-for-fun altcoin that everybody could still mine on a regular PC.  Instead, it's quickly becoming rather commercialized and going well into the realm of e.g. Litecoin.  Of course they probably hold a few Dogecoin themselves, so they wouldn't be all *that* pissed :)

I know.  The 15kFY address is the one I generated a button for (no idea whose it is - just picked one at random off the front page).  When clicking that button, it contacts the blockchain.info API, which generates a new (temporary) address - in this case the 15t1Tg one - and presents that as the donation address.  When people donate to that address, blockchain.info will do two things: 1. forward the donation to the actual address (15kFY), and 2. optionally notify the owner via a callback function (not implemented in the donate button thing, I think).
You'll notice that if you refresh and click it, again and again, it generates a different donation address every time.
Whether that's desirable or not for your purposes is something I can't evaluate - but at least you can (mostly) ignore the people suggesting it's malware / hacks :)

Think of it like this.. you know how BitTorrent is a decentralized protocol?  Yet if you wanted to find a place to get torrents, you'd probably name 2 or 3 big indexing sites, and without those (TEN MORE WILL POP UP!), you're kind of stuffed.
Same thing here.  The technology is decentralized, but people's natural tendency is to centralize things anyway.
Similarly, it's not impossible for a single person with an Antminer U2 or whatever to find a block - it's just extremely unlikely.  So you get a million people with Antminer U2's, and the odds that ONE of them finds a block goes up.  
But that doesn't help the 999,999 others.  So they pool together, so that ultimately everybody gets 1/1,000,000th of the reward.  
But then they realize that all this network sending back and forth and calculating shares and whatnot is really a pain in the ass and a large waste of power and effort - so instead they all decide to send their Antminers to a single location.  
The leap from there to an entrepreneurial person saying "why don't I just *buy* 1,000,000 Antminers and sell hashing power to people piece-wise, get the investment amount back immediately, get a small percentage of the rewards to cover operating expenses and a bit of profit, while the 'miners' don't have to bother with sourcing them, pooling them / sending them in, etc. - it's win/win for all!" is... not much of a leap at all.
That doesn't mean that lone person with a single Antminer U2 can't still find a block, so technologically speaking it remains decentralized - but practically speaking, not so much.

As for your actual question - the usual, trojans/hackery/bug, maybe fat-fingered it, even?  Have you checked if the other address is an existing address on the blockchain? (since most perps don't bother generating a new address for each victim since that would require communicating the private key for it to said perp somehow, and nobody's blacklisting 'known to belong to perp'-addresses anyway).

Just to note - the vanity addresses were not hacked.  A service that generated vanity addresses for users using an inherently secure method but executed badly (though the users did have the choice of overriding, many didn't) was hacked.  May seem like a subtle difference, but it's actually quite a big difference.  There's nothing about vanity addresses that make them inherently insecure.
That said - vanity addresses are also not what OP would be looking for, as a vanity can still map to millions of addresses.  FirstBits would be closer to what the OP's looking for, but that's still often a random string of letters and numbers (unless specifically sought out early on).
I don't know if, within the Bitcoin ecosystem, the addresses are really an issue though.  Wallets will let you specify a label, websites and certainly mobile apps offer QR codes for easy transfer, between computers there's always just copy/paste.  The only time it could marginally rear its head is in colloquial conversation - in which case, *any* URL shortening service that lets you set a custom short URL would work.

It should go through eventually.  If 'eventually' takes too long, you might have to deliberately try to 'double spend' them, with a fee attached, and get miners to accept that spend (which normally they try not to do) instead of the existing one.  Something like that - bit tricky :)

Okay, then yes it's a big deal.  Keep in mind that even if the miner does defer to other processes on the client's machine, something is still being borrowed: lifetime of components in the machine.

Correct. Nothing. Due diligence is advised.  Alternatively, don't use Bitcoin (at this time) if you want to make anonymous transactions - Bitcoin, from the onset, was always only pseudonymous and transactions are in the open.  There are altcoins that fare much better at any anonymity aspect.

For miners not in it for the long haul, Ghash.io's favorable terms mean that staying with them gets them more BTC right now - and with the still upward trend at exchanges, means they can get more USD for it.  Sure, it might collapse - then again, it might not - even if it does, they could bank on dumping before that happens (thus helping make it happen).

Bad title - you're asking about private key and bitcoin address :)
The answer is 'yes', though I haven't looked into the math of exactly how many keys can theoretically map to a single address.  I do know that the way the addresses are derived, there's actually great variability in the likelihood of you getting a key that maps to a given one - which thus affects the likelihood of getting 2 or more keys mapping to it.
The numbers involved are so mind-bafflingly huge, though, that it's highly unlikely that you'd get a key that maps to an address that would be actively in use.

tl;dr important bit:
We present an mCRL2 model of the Bitcoin protocol based on the current protocol description.  With this model of the real Bitcoin protocol, the Bitcoin network can be simulated and verified.  The former can be useful for analysing certain network situations, such as double-spending attacks.  THe latter can be useful to determine the robustness of the protocol, i.e. if Bitcoin is able to detect and handles protocol deviations correctly.
Based on our findings, we also briefly discuss the Bitcoin protocol and the implications it has for Bitcoin as a currency.  Using scenario-based verification, we were able to verify that the Bitcoin protocol satisfies our requirements under various circumstances.

Note that an important thing to keep in mind is that he doesn't know if a given public key X is close to one of the 'rendezvous points' he alludes to.  He only knows that if it takes N steps to get from a given public key X to that point, then it takes N steps to work back from that to get the private key.  That N could be rather small (such as those specifically generated by a piece of code he posted to demonstrate it can be reversed), or it could be enormous.  afaict, It's essentially brute forcing, but with slight guidance.  Kind of like saying brute-forcing a 16-character password is hard, but not as hard as when it's a password anywhere between 1 and 16 characters, since you can now skip 1-15.

You might also consider using vanitygen to create a list of prefixed addresses + the keys, e.g. "1pynr..." or "1card1..." - takes a while to generate them, but adds a little flair to the payment addresses you'd be using.

I think the only 'layer on top of Bitcoin' thing that I've seen that might work is where work done on another project can be included as a 'tag' on a transaction and let miners treat them different from those without such a tag.  For example, allowing them to have a zero transaction fee where otherwise the miner might only accept those with a fee above a certain amount.  Of course this would have to be entirely voluntary and it jiggles the doorknob for more sinister uses.

In theory, yes.  The problem with it is that there first needs to be a way to uniquely identify a particular digital good in the first place.  Say that it's a small string in the header of the file that says "original owner: [btc address]".  That's fine.  But what's going to stop me from changing that to "original owner: lolpiracyftw"?  The only way to do that is to have it be encrypted, and the very ability to use that digital good (e.g. to read the book / listen to the music / etc.) be dependent on the decryption of that data.  I.e. DRM.  (Un)fortunately, DRM where the valid users still gets access to the data is practically always circumvented, sometimes by default (analog loophole), sometimes because the DRM scheme is actually broken.

Interestingly enough, that's exactly the sort of thing that Bitcoin could be used for, especially with a multiple-signature requirement.  It would prevent the sale of such a 'bitmedal' unless the IOC also agrees to it (which they probably wouldn't), it would prevent the IOC from revoking it (unless a third party arbiter agreed to doing so), and would irrevocably lay down who won what.  It's a great example of use of Bitcoin-the-technology (as opposed to just Bitcoin-the-cryptocurrency)

As far as I can tell from the guy's explanation, these are points on the curve where, for example, the X coordinate varies relatively little as you go along the curve.  He then suggests that if he takes a public key and starts subtracting (or adding, can't really know) continuously (counting the number of times to do so) until he ends up at one of these points, he can then take that number of times to figure out what the private key would be.
His main purpose is not necessarily to 'crack' public keys, but to see how many of these weak 'areas' in the curve there are, whether or not there is a concentration of public keys in these same areas, and thus derive whether or not it becomes attractive to attempt brute force attacking of public keys for addresses that hold a balance to see if you can get to any of these points rather quickly (and in dedicated hardware, that would be much faster than with the given python/c++ code) and as a result empty out such an address.
It's still way over my head, though - I'm certainly not a cryptographer and may be way off :)

Well that's actually easy enough.  Just say: It's not the official price.  
The only problem with the way you're going about this is that you're just eliciting the follow-up question: What *is* the official price?
And then you're going to be stuck diving way too deep into how there is no official price, that exchange rates vary by platform, day, hour, supply, demand, bids and sells, alignment of planets, and the exact angle of your pinkie toe when you got up this morning.  And who wants to get into that, really?
So just let the 'new users' accept that price as 'the' price, and find out for themselves the ugly details; they'll get to learn more, too.

Once you enter that level of paranoia - for all you know they record the entire screen ;) - you might as well set yourself up with a boot CD/DVD/USB that essentially has a clean environment.

Given how many potential addresses there are, I don't think you quite understand what the odds in that 'lotto' would be.
Unless you're proposing that it only pays out to some list of addresses known to exist - in which case you'd either have to trust some separate list, or anybody wishing to partake in said 'lotto' would have to first make a transaction to it to have it recorded in the blockchain.
In either case, what's to stop somebody from amassing as many addresses as they can in order to claim as much of the lotto payouts as possible?  While it's easy enough for my computer to generate umpteenthousands of addresses every day, somebody with a whole network of computers, or even a botnet, can easily generate multitudes more.
Note that this is considering only your lotto idea.  If the actual mining algorithm were changed, expect everybody and their dog to move to Scrypt-based coins as those still have efficient hardware mining solutions, and things will simply concentrate again from there.
Also note that this is in some form of reality where any such change would even gain enough of a following to warrant a fork that starts with the then-current blockchain, and progresses from there; otherwise you might as well just launch a new coin... in which case, there's already plenty to choose from.

For the curious, the spec changes effectively mean the following in terms of calculations (with a lot of assumptions about the exchange rate remaining as relatively stable as it has been, of course):
 +  for more realistic returns
Previously for the given 2000GH/s and 1650W, you'd stand to make $13,200 by September.
With the revised numbers of 1900W-2100W and 1630GH/s to 1720GH/s..  
best case scenario: $8,950 by August
worst case scenario: $7,520 by August.
By sending a second box, that should roughly make up for the numbers.
( Of course you did need to have a big lump of cash to throw at it in the first place. )
Edit: Oops - this offer is for the Dec batch.  I think the numbers still work out similarly, though genesisblock's calculator won't let you choose a time in the past. *eyeroll*

You'd think that sort of information would be easy to find.  Maybe it is - but the site isn't being obvious about it, and Google's not helping much either.
As far as I can tell it's a 'hot wallet' - so yes, that would be online.  They do open source their code, so in theory you could set up your own.
However, no, it's not 'just a wallet' - it includes mobile API instructions (all standardized stuff) so that you can, for example, scan a QR code without needing a native app at all.  Note that I think the camera thing only works on iOS 6 and up?  So it wouldn't be a full solution to all iPhone users.
Of course 'unbannable' is a wash.  Apple could certainly put sites they don't like on a block list for the default browser (and guess what - Apple doesn't really like alternative browsers), or scan for the word bitcoin + those APIs to selectively block a page, etc.  I mean, if they really, really wanted to.
For all we know, they'll let Bitcoin apps back in next week - after all, Apple is nothing if not fickle on their app store decisions.

Just in case you haven't already read through this:  
If you read the part there about having a CSV of addresses on your server, and assuming you know a bit of PHP or other scripting language, you can then read addresses from the CSV list and put them into, e.g.:  
You'd have to customize it a bit to add payment amount, etc. or google around for a more appropriate widget - you'll at least want one that handles bitcoin payment URIs (when clicked they launch the user's wallet/payment application with the appropriate amount filled in) and QR codes (for those that use mobile devices to make their bitcoin payments).

I'm going to disagree with here;
While it's an oft-repeated suggestion that the idea was 'one cpu, one vote', everybody was well aware of the fact that even that would merely lead to people with 1,000 CPUs under their control getting 1,000 votes, and anybody capable of controlling a botnet getting potentially millions of votes.

Input events are already part of Android's entropy pool sources (not sure if wallets still use that, given the screw-up from a while ago).
There's many, many more sources that an entropy pool could tap into - unfortunately they're not all readily accessible, or not always opportune to do so, and the permissions model means that if you wanted to cover them all, the app would look very scary (even if it can be easily proven that it only takes the data for an entry pool).

An update has been posted at 
Sounds like it was mostly a problem in their internal 'send between users' feature (probably similar to MtGox's in that it would be instant and wouldn't require any fees), and unless I'm reading it wrong.. the bug was that if you send 2 transfers for X amount, out of an account that did not have 2X but only at least 1X, at the same time.. both transfers would succeed *before* the system would end up updating the balance of that account to -1X (alert, alert!).

I'm slightly disappointed by Peter doing the time=money thing.  At one point he mentions that if it takes him an hour to set up merged mining, and he bills $100/hour, then if he doesn't make back that $100 within a year, he's not going to bother.  
One could just as easily argue that if he got 1 hour less sleep, he'd offset that hour 'wasted' and get the benefit of merged mining.  
Or not use P2Pool (thus not needing the full node).  etc.
The technical discussion is pretty good, though.

Crowdfunding platforms prove you wrong.

I might be annoyed, and maybe I'll even demand a refund depending on exactly what transpired.
If, on the other hand, they fail to do so because they're spending their funds on personal affairs, or withholding the product for unspecified reasons - you're right I do expect them to be put in a cage.  Even if it's just the temporary cage of a court session to get at the facts.

Try reading this:  
However, it only actually deals with pools on a technological level, and with centralized mining on a psychological level.  If psychology worked the way it 'should', then we wouldn't be in this position in the first place ;)
As cipher_gnome points out, there's no way to check the identity of a miner - which means that for any PoW-based coin (and PoS is not a magical solution either), you're always going to gravitate towards pools and centralization.
A long time ago I started work on a different proof, one that essentially requires the ownership of a particular device with an unmutable unique ID.  Unfortunately after a few meetings we concluded that it would ultimately run into the same problems (except with people selling their devices) and worse, it would have to be combined with existing schemes as otherwise - once profitable enough - manufacturers would simply decap, toss it under a microscope, and deduce exactly how it works and make their own valid 'copies'.
That latter part can be overcome, the former not so much.

I think you'll notice that most of the algorithmic trading can be put into two bins: short term trades (in which case.. sure, I can probably fairly accurately predict what USD/BTC is going to do in the next 5 minutes, too), and long term trades on stable stock; don't know if you've noticed, but USD/BTC is anything but.
If you believe otherwise, by all means, we'll see what happens to the predictions made by the site in question, and you can add your own if you'd like.  For the record, the site predictions at about midnight UTC:  
Midnight April 5th: $442.5 (1.277% error)  
Midnight April 10th: $508.5 (2.582% error)  
Midnight April 25th: $546.6 (8.065% error)

Please, save your antics and false dichotomy.
You're right, people should be aware of the fees they pay for third party actors.  But when 'you were told bitcoins were free to use without fees', the person who told you either clearly misrepresented things or was just bad at communicating.  If you weren't literally told but instead read about it yourself, then I'm afraid you may have misread or misinterpreted it yourself.  
Every discussion about any 'free' aspect of Bitcoin is about the transactions themselves, and the first thing that pops up with that is that even that is not necessarily free (since not attaching a fee means it may take a while for your transaction to get included and verified).  
As soon as you step outside of that - e.g. a hosted wallet, a payment processor, an exchange, etc.  there's likely to be fees - same as with everything else in life where somebody provides a service-of-convenience.
Still, I hope that burger was tasty :)

Why would they load devices with satoshis?  This isn't about them giving away free Bitcoin (even if satoshis).  Similarly, the electricity cost isn't theirs to be worried about.
You might ask why consumers would want a device that has a chip in it that - as far as they're concerned - is mining Bitcoin that they won't see any returns on.. but if it's in embedded devices, they might as well never know about it unless a regulatory body steps in and demands that this be advertised on the box; and even then, who reads all the text on boxes? (see also: people complaining about 'unrippable' CDs, even though the case mentions copy-protection stuff on there).  Heck, they might even put it in big capital letters on the box as a feature to get people curious and excited, throwing in discounts on services or whatever if the user runs it with the chip enabled.
There's nothing particularly impossibly ridiculous about it from a company/consumer standpoint.  It's the third parties they'd have to convince to integrate the chip - and I can tell you right now that there's plenty of interest; guy I know who's inquired as to the SFARDS dev kit signed up for 21's stuff a few months ago... and this is quite possibly more interesting than SFARDS's chip (which is a more high power chip).

There's always going to be an 'unfair' element, even if it's maybe not quite as distorted as the current (and future) Bitcoin scenario.. and if that exists, then there will always be people making enough profit to expand further, making more profit, expanding further, making more profit, etc. and making payouts to the 1.6Ghz pentium miners dwindle regardless of how many actual 'people' are in a pool.

1. Passwords weren't compromised.  A database was compromised, which included hashed and salted passwords.  Yes, it's still bad, especially if you had a ridiculously weak password and due to the number of hashes available.  
2. If people had other accounts with the same password, they should be whacked over the head with a cluebat.

No, not really:  
"This year, a 30-second spot is an eye-popping $4 million while a 60-second spot goes for a jaw-dropping $8 million."
Keep in mind that, despite the popularity of SuperBowl ads in general (and the really popular ones are extremely expensive to produce in the first place), after a few days you already lose the eyeballs and even discussion; remember when Coke dared put America the Beautiful as sung in different languages on TV?  That was perfect - loved by many, hated by some, heated debates followed... for about a week.  After that, most people stopped caring and even the haters went back to drinking Coke products (if they ever stopped at all).  So that's $4M down the drain never to benefit from again.
So what would you hope to achieve with that?  Make people aware of Bitcoin?  Great - and then what?  Are we really in a position right now to bring Bitcoin to the masses?  Keep in mind that the vast majority of people won't even quite understand why they can't actually use it everywhere, and why there's a waiting period at many places where they can use it directly (instead of through a payment processor).
Honestly, a Bitcoin SuperBowl ad sounds great - but I don't think it's a good idea at this time.  But that's my opinion, and it's a moot opinion since the funds couldn't pay for it anyway.
So instead he's spending it on Forum software - well, a portion of it anyway.  Yes, it's way more than I would spend on it*, but then again let's be honest... if it were a simple task, it would have been done already.  SMF is clearly not fitting the bill, and clearly nor do phpBB, UBB and others.  That's the whole point of developing a new one, to develop something that does work for their needs, and hopefully the needs of others (wooo open source).
*If* somebody disagrees and believes that better forum software can be made for cheaper, or that it already exists, they're certainly welcome to try.
Remember bitcointa.lk ?  "the Bitcointalk community with a proper forum software".  It hasn't seen a post in quite a while, and this despite the fact that that site tended to mirror posts made at bitcointalk.org in the first place; it had the content, it had the presentation, and yet it failed.  Are we really to blame the dominance of bitcointalk.org as a URL trumping the supposed superiority of bitcointa.lk itself?
If so, see who's behind bitcoin.me, throw them some money to get the DNS records for bitcointalk.com, set up the supposedly superior site, and off you go.
\* Just a side note about the amount, as you've already commented on this bit: yes, it was worth far less when the funds came in than it is worth now.  [citation needed] will apply to the following, but perhaps the contract with the developers is that they would be paid a fixed amount in Bitcoin.  The discussion over how much that is worth in fiat now (millions or pennies) is completely moot in that case, other than for our initial gut reaction; had it been pennies, we would be laughing at how they're spending many weeks of work on forum software for a pittance.

Wouldn't that just provide incentive for miners to include as few transactions as possible, if the subsidy for a block remains as well?  Given that you'd be racing against others who may include fewer transactions in order to get the block faster (on average).

Any miner who includes fewer transactions has a potential edge of a small sliver of time in which they can be hashing while the competition goes through the effort of including transactions.
You could - and they most likely have - automate this such that as soon as they become aware of a new block, they immediately start hashing on the next one, with potentially zero transactions included.
Over time they can always start including transactions as the time that the machines spend hashing is effectively downtime for the job submission parts of the controller(s) anyway.  Then the next time a job gets submitted (either because it has to or they just force one) they can just send that on over.
They're not the only miner that does this either.. just look for a list of all blocks with just a coinbase transaction.
@_date: 2014-05-24 14:55:39
Yes, and no.
What they can do is change the code in the reference / defacto-standard Bitcoin client.
But whether the majority of the Bitcoin network decides to accept those changes is another matter.  Odds are they will, but if not, or some group keeps to the old code base, there will effectively be a fork.

Yet both suck at making predictions about the future on an inherently 'unpredictable' item.  By 'unpredictable' I don't mean that it couldn't predict whether it goes up or down, or can't give a ballpark, just that the margins of error are going to be pretty big (even if smaller than that for humans) and it still wouldn't account for, say, the next hack of a major exchange happening, or the U.S. suddenly reversing its stance entirely and subjecting businesses to the same rules as they would if they were dealing with foreign currencies.

Again when Slashdot covered it (influx of people new to it).  But after that?  It was just MtGox or Gox and it was a Bitcoin exchange.  Only with the recent troubles has the "Magic: The Gathering" thing popped back up en-masse.  Is that fair game?  Sure, of course it is.  But let's not forget that for a very long time, nobody cared about the origin - there certainly wasn't any concerted effort to get MtGox to change their name to something that could have been a bit more respectable.

Try googling "bitcoin mining calculator".  There you can enter the cost of the machine, the power it uses, your electricity cost, its hash rate, and expected changes in difficulty that would all affect the returns.

Keep in mind that by most interpretations of their plan, this would only be a physical decentralization of hashing power - i.e. a whole bunch of people having a widget with which they can mine (whether they like it or not).
In terms of who the mining work is done for, however, it would be a part-centralization.  Unless you can specify your own node or pool to mine against, somebody will effectively have control over that hashing power and with it can promise the oft-cited 25% to the user... but a year down the road they could just as well change that to 20%, 10%, or - why not - 0%.

tl;dr: microtransactions without the fees.  Instead of a flat fee, let people pay only for what they watch.  There's a problem with the numbers suggested, though:


At Netflix's current $7.99/month, that would be approximately 32 movies or 1 movie per day.  Way more than than the typical viewer would watch (unless they're binge-watching).  The suggested prices don't make sense unless they can make up for it in volume.
Given that Netflix has ~30M viewers and there's only ~130M taxpayers - many of which share a household in which the Netflix account would easily be shared (the $7.99 plan allows streaming to more than 1 screen simultaneously as it is, nevermind non-simultaneous) - that doesn't leave all that much more volume to go after.
While Bitcoin transactions may be attractive for various reasons, the suggested prices would not likely be it.. nor the lack of automatic, subscription, billing.

Because you can look at the source code and see what it does, run statistical tests on random data generated by built-in functions (and find the source code for those), and see how it incorporates the user-driven entropy (mouse coordinates) into the generation process.
Of course it is possible that the built-in functions aren't quite proper random, and your own mouse movements may have a consistent bias, etc. etc.  but it would be quite a feat to determine anything from those that would lead you to be able to use it to your advantage (by e.g. predicting the next key generated)

I think David Francois is suggesting they could be more sly about it, by only targeting specific customers.. e.g. those with high trade volumes, for example ..and mucking with their specific information.
He seems a bit trollish though.  I have no idea why he called  'jelly' (how old is David?) for them having an app in the App Store while blockchain.info does not.  blockchain.info has always worked fine for me in several mobile browsers, and doesn't need an app.  Though I know many iDevice users want apps anyway because reasons, and blockchain.info could certainly make one.. it's not like bitcoin-central is the only wallet app in the app store now (be that with apps invoking the safari browser, or via careful misleading of the reviewers at Apple, etc.).
That said.. the cloudflare thing is mostly annoying - I end up at landing pages where it says it's 'checking browser', when really it's just throwing in some javascript with a basic calculation that needs solving, sent back to the server, then fetch a cookie, and use that for access.  Took all of 2 minutes to get that working on a bot, so I'm not sure why it's there.. certainly seems like a poor defense level.
On the other hand, if bitcoin-central prides themselves on not using third party protection measures, it seems like they would welcome a real life test to see how their servers hold up.  Not that I'm suggesting anything.  I'm sure they have improved things since last time they were targeted.

Let's say you set a very low difficulty for the tx PoW and say you solving a block with 10 transactions takes, on average, 1 second longer than the person who includes zero transactions - then on average, the person who includes zero transactions, all other things kept equal, still miners more blocks.  The fees for those transactions would have to be juicy enough to include to offset the risk in not getting the subsidy reward... which is pretty much the status quo anyway.
Without making any fundamental changes, one could just as easily have miners collude and agree to only include high-fee transactions.

Well, in terms of the goal of OSM, the idea is that if they accept a particular form of payment ('cash' is given as an example), then that should be added.  So from an OSM-centric view, if McDonald's were to decide such, all of their locations should get it added.
But yes, in terms of showing where Bitcoin is accepted.. well, if you know McDonald's does, you don't really need to know their specific location on coinmap.. just punch up mcdonald's on *any* map/nav.  Adding all McDonald's locations would otherwise clutter the map with thousands of pins (14,000 in June, 2012) when it might be more interesting to know what 'small' stores accept it in a given location.
If this does happen, I'm sure Coinmap could start adding filters so that these results get hidden, as well as allowing you to filter by category, etc.

Of course there's a protocol - or at least code - that says what you can and can't do.  It also effectively says you can't just claim a million Bitcoin for a block, for example.  The point isn't that there's no rules - but that those rules are formed and enforced by consensus.  A lot of the debate isn't just about whether the block size should be increased - and if so, to what size (including unlimited size) - but about the best way to do this before pushing it out as an update that consensus can then potentially be formed around.

The bit that comes closest is that "Bitcoin will be in a state of constant loss" part.  But loss of what?  Units?  Sure.  Value?  Debatable.  Fungibility as a result of the loss?  Just increase the accuracy - though this should go hand-in-hand with value anyway.
Not shooting down the idea - but wondering if it's a solution looking for a problem.

Yeah, this should have gotten way more upvotes.
On the one hand, BitFury is one of the few hardware manufacturers with known capital injections and pretty solid delivery (of chips - can't vouch for all the assemblers that stick them into miners), a known performance track level, and their own rather sizable farm.
On the other hand, why wasn't the first injection enough?  *Can* they compete with AsicMiner on $/J/hashrate or are they having trouble materializing their new fabric?

Yep, absolutely!  Do *not* re-use addresses!  Most wallet software will already handle this for you (e.g. if you have 1BTC and pay X 0.5BTC, then it sends the other 0.5BTC to Y, where Y is an address it generated itself and will have the private key for).  For many real-world uses, this can be a pain, but that's where BIP32 or something similar is supposed to come in.

That wouldn't really be up to 21 Inc. - although they could certainly make that part of the licensing agreement for the chip.
It could very well be that a licensor puts it in big bold letters on the packaging, putting it forth as a marketing gimmick.  "Earn X Store Credit with the XBit Technology!* (XBit may be disabled if the customer does not wish to earn X Store Credit)"
Finding those parties that will license it is the roadblock.. the consumer? Not so much.

tl;dr: You can include messages in a Bitcoin transaction - "Payment for X", "Hello world", spam and less desirable manifestos.
There's a pretty simple technical solution client-side: ignore messages in transactions below a certain threshold, unless from a known address that you actually need to know about.

It's a double-edged sword that sees abuse - i.e. people critical of a company having their posts deleted.
But I also see plenty of threads that make me think the OP should have started the thread out as self-moderated in order to deal with people who don't read, trolls, people who only post memes, people who only use the thread to attack other people and so forth and so on.
The alternative of "report All The Things™" to moderators and then having those moderators put in the time to review, check, make judgment calls, etc. doesn't always work out well.
I think a more appropriate compromise would be to have preferences as to whether you want to see (self-)moderated posts or not - can make that a global default + per-thread setting.  That way if somebody wants to see criticism and take trolls alike for granted, they can always set it so (or not disable it if displayed by default).

No, doesn't matter.

I suspect there's very little demand for Bitcoin-specific talent.  Unless you want to work on the protocol/specification - which right now is largely a community effort so it's not a primary target of incorporation into a business plan - a lot of businesses that start up around Bitcoin are really just looking for general IT workers, developers, sales people, etc.  Add to that the fact that most startups tend to be a group of friends/acquaintances that start small and really aren't looking to expand beyond their immediately sustainable growth, and there you go.
If you're a software developer, then there's plenty of Bitcoin(-related) wishlist items that you could fill.. not sure if you can monetize on it, but then again you could just ask for donations in Bitcoin :)

Like minds tend to band together.  That's not necessarily due to the publication, but just one writer checking out the other writers and feeling they think alike.  You see this all the time in political publishing, but even more so in sports publishing.  Even if the publication stays largely 'neutral', the writers will use third party outlets to express their opinions (which 'are not the opinion of my employer', is a common disclaimer) in unison.
You can still see the same with another person who writes for CCN who calls coinfire's account of events so far "bullshit" and making a leap of logic.  They couldn't publish that on CCN because I'd imagine whatever editorial process is adhered to would wipe it off the table - but they can still write it on twitter, facebook, reddit, whatever other forum.
And yes, this banding together of like minds eventually catches up to the publication, and they have to step in.  CCN has done so in the case of this particular writer - hopefully the others will clue in and adjust their tone / or decry CCN's move and in a grand gesture distance themselves from CCN and find a new site to anchor their like-mindedness to.

The chain of events is... weird, at best.
At first they were possibly going to be de-listed because of lack of HSTS support (which may be out of their hands, provided they want to stick to certain third party services that help protect domains).
If they only said that they weren't going to be implementing HSTS any time soon, the concern would really be more about *that*, than about the de-listing as a consequence.
But now it appears to have turned into a case of preferring not to be listed even if they do add HSTS support.  To which I'd say - well tough luck, if bitcoin.org wants to list them (again), they can't exactly prevent that.
Assuming you're the same ywecur as on github, I agree with your position (even if potentially for different reasons).

That is unfortunate, but not entirely unexpected.
As it is, (Bictoin) mining software is practically divided between those who use cgminer, and those who use bfgminer, with some overlap.  While there is other software, it's nowhere near as popular.  Just recently I gave ScalaMiner (a JAVA implementation) a shot - couldn't get it to work, but that might have been me - and found that its discussion thread at BitcoinTalk was just a few posts from the author and zero feedback from the public.. that's got to be disheartening as well.
On the other hand, the author of MacMiner has a point, and even if mining software may always still find users, there's probably not much need for having a dozen different pieces of software when instead you can rely on one or two, and build an application around those - which MacMiner did as well.
MultiMiner - which runs on Macs as well - uses bfgminer as its backend, for example.  'DualMinter' uses cgminer as its backend.  Both present user-friendly GUIs.

tl;dr: The usual "Bitcoin micropayments are going to enable P2P media distribution that can compensate artists" pipedream.
Pipedream because nobody in the big leagues of media wants *micro*payments.  They're not exactly jumping up and down in joy at the prices being offered by Pandora, Spotify, Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime subscriptions.
Lower transaction fees in Bitcoin will allow a larger profit vs, say, PayPal, Credit Cards and Apple Pay sounds great, until the pipedream part reveals that the larger profit is measured in *cents*;


Add to this that this appears to be a per-consumption charge, and costs are actually much higher compared to a subscription platform such as the aforementioned.
His tip to the media industry is a good one, but unfortunately it's not one that's going to be picked up any time soon.  That's not even the content producers' fault, or even the content distributors' fault, but rather the fault of the plethora of rights management companies around the world.  That's something that's already hindering adoption of services in e.g. Europe - as these services have to negotiate with half a dozen rights management companies in each and every country.  Having an API that simplifies licensing of the content itself does nothing for that.  The babysteps the EU councils are taking to harmonize the markets will do much more; at the expense of local economies and opening the floodgates even further to U.S. companies to take over the entire European market.

If you effectively control a part of how the transactions are signed, you can hold power over it.  This type is subtle (but can be automatically caught - several people have written utilities to do so.. some for good, others for 'evil'), but it still requires you to use something that is out of the norm.

There's really no 'the bitcoin wallet'.  There is just 'wallet software' (be that a program on your computer or some website).  Think of said wallet software as a front-end to things related to bitcoin private keys and bitcoin addresses for the most part.
So you could have a wallet that just keeps a record of your addresses and private key(s), their balances, and a list of addresses you regularly send transactions to.  
You could have a wallet that automatically generates return addresses to prevent address re-use and hides those addresses from you so you don't have to worry about it.  
You could have a wallet that generates addresses and private keys for you based on particular mechanisms, be that from a simple master key or a hierarchical deterministic method.  
The wallet software could even include things like automating payments, allow signing of messages, etc.
Essentially - and this might make some people cringe - think of wallet software as Outlook.  You can see your accounts, you can see your list of contacts, you get a list of your e-mails, you can send an e-mail from one account to somebody else, it keeps your account login info on file, etc.  All of that is largely front-end to the underlying pop/smtp/imap/exchange protocol stuff that you generally don't want to be bothered with.

Not sure where you got that information - it's wrong.


Edit: Oh, I see where you got confused.  You're talking about the *private key* encoded in Wallet Import Format.

There's probably some blockchain parser that you could leverage to get what you're looking for more specifically, but just using google to go 'site:blockchain.info 0.00000001' will get you a bunch of transactions that were just a single satoshi.  You'd have to narrow it down manually to find ones that only had a single receiver (if you feel that sending 10 people 1 satoshi counts as a '10 satoshi' transaction).

Reddit's layout and ranking mechanism may be more attuned to your likings for how to read over the material, filter things out in your mind, etc.  But then that's less to do with bitcointalk and the aforementioned per se, but with how forum software is structured.

Definitions don't have to be rigid in order for a subject to be classified as satisfying the terms of the definition or not.  In the case of Web 2.0 and, so far, Bitcoin 2.0 however, even that classification when trying to see if a given subject can be termed to fall under 'Bitcoin 2.0' is one of "no.  wait, yes.  well, maybe... hang on" until a marketing person steps in and says "of course it's Bitcoin 2.0, in fact I'd label it Bitcoin 3.0 if I could get away with it!".  Oh, wait: 
If you can't make that determination for a given labeling, then the labeling itself becomes meaningless.  I think that's the part you're inclined to disagree with, and I'll happily agree to disagree :)
As for lazy marketing: pretty much that.
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:03:38
To which I will counter:  So back when I had a comment form on my personal homepage, i was doing Web 2.0 before Web 2.0 was called "Web 2.0"?
Or was that really just Web 1.5, because it was written straight out to the static content file, rather than included server-side?  Or actually, did it only become 2.0 once we started using xmlhttprequest and server-side inclusion of user-submitted content was Web 1.7?
Just because people attending conferences like to huddle together and speak of technologies in the same sentence as "Web 2.0", doesn't mean that it is well-defined.
Any which way you look at Web 2.0 'definitions', they're all completely hazy and speak of certain characteristics that may or may not elevate a website from being 'Web 1.0' to 'Web 2.0'.  The major use of "Web 2.0" has been, and still is, in marketing.
The same applies to Bitcoin (and block chain technology).
Otherwise, as per version of the definition, spam dust is clearly Bitcoin 2.0.  It's not Bitcoin itself, but it does rely on the (Bitcoin) block chain as an avenue for propagating messages; in their case, spam.  FirstBits was probably Bitcoin 2.0 as well by that definition.
Per your definition, NameCoin could possibly fall under 'Bitcoin 2.0'.

That's generally not how miners work, but there are some miners around there that are effectively designed with renting out hash rate in mind so that one's customers can then specify the mining pool they want to use.  Even though this may not be down to the individual ASIC chip, at least if you have a single controller hooked up to, say, 8 boards, you can still divide those 8 boards up any which way you'd like.
That said, it's a bit of a gimmick - it's much less of a PITA to stick with a single pool per controller.

@_date: 2015-01-10 03:02:55
Your example is a bit contrived, and I'll have to give counter-examples for your suggestion.
To get the first one out of the way - you have one address in which you changed a 1 (one) to an I (uppercase letter i).  Those are not allowed in addresses to begin with, but more importantly: even if you had changed it to one that does look similar, is valid, and to which you have the private key, you would have spent a fair bit of time generating it.  
( TheHelpfulGuy also touched on this. )
The second bit relates to the fact that you're encoding the addresses as colors as some sort of check.  That's fine, but you already noticed that color blind people will have issues.  But you really don't need to be color blind.  How many people are going to see the difference between e.g. bdff00 and d4ff00 colors, especially if they do not have an exact reference? (if they have an exact reference, odds are they would have an exact address to begin with).  
As an example, try this address: 12VrBiLJ7iuRWzMcB3ha4TU2rvzM2yiGj4  
There's still 4 swatches, but how many people can clearly see the difference between the left and right half?
Given that most would not easily see the difference, that opens it up to targeting by merely generating addresses that look 'close enough'.  
Compare, for example, your 18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcCIjnzKWEg5VZ to 1HN66o8m9U3RJhTXUG8geDzRDzKq8aoU9y .  Sure, swatch  is decidedly more orange.. and swatch 1 is more pinkish than purple but keep in mind I only found this one by entering some random addresses off of the latest block's transactions.  A targeted attack could easily generate thousands of addresses which, when using your scheme, will look close enough - or even be exact matches.
I do think it's a semi-novel approach, but as with so many of these approaches, they should be combined with other approaches, or else it can instill a false sense of security.

There was/is a site that basically mirrored bitcointalk.org and presented a more modern interface - bitcointa.lk .  It went nowhere fast.
Personally I don't really care for more modern forum interfaces.  It's a crapton of whitespace and reduction of elements for the sake of catering to people who prefer browsing things on a tablet or on a phone.  And that's fine - if those were the only devices it's presented on.  Instead, the same design is then extended to desktop users because the mobile/tablet users want a homogeneous experience across all devices; whitespace overload included.
I'm not saying there isn't room for improvement, or that a sleeker look wouldn't be nice, but a lot of forums are just taking it too far.

Not saying they shouldn't switch to bcrypt - given that it's fairly trivial and there's certainly benefits on the slow-an-attacker-down front (at the cost of but-it-hasn't-seen-quite-as-much-scrutiny), but it's not exactly like 7500 rounds of sha256 is easybreasy.

phishing implies that somebody tricked you into giving them the details needed to create a transaction for coin identified to be in your wallet, or perhaps even tricked you into making that transaction yourself.
'Re-phishing' would thus entail much the same.  Not very likely to happen as you (presumably) don't know who you're targeting - only an address.
You can always try asking nicely - but if the 9 BTC were transferred with ill intent, then that's not likely either.
The last option would be to try brute forcing, but unless the address sent to was some weakly generated brain wallet type thing - you're not going to get very far with that either.  
In the off chance that this is the case, you can always post the address / transaction ID(s).
tl;dr: sorry, that ~9 BTC is in all likelihood gone.

People will never learn in their greed-driven eagerness to get powerful hardware before anybody else.
It truly doesn't matter if it's BFL, HashFast, CoinTerra, AMT, or any of these other companies that suddenly find themselves with performance, delivery, or 'actually having a product to sell in the first place' problems.
People will always accept pre-orders as being a normal way to do business, will always accept "two more weeks" no matter who the vendor is, and even when the shit has truly hit the fan, will give the company respite again and again and again as long as the company keeps them appeased with "soon", until the point has reached that everybody realizes things are screwed up, and will grasp at straws to get compensated, even if that means accepting chips (good luck getting those onto a board) or the hashing power paid for (but due to difficulty increases, will never see even the worst returns you had envisioned), because if you keep waiting or try for a lawsuit, those people will be left empty-handed.
While people are quick to chant "don't accept pre-orders" and similar, and telling companies that "the time for pre-orders is gone", companies know damn well there's always people willing to take that risk, in order potentially to be that one miner who gets shiny new hardware a few weeks before anybody else, and reap all the benefits - and they know that when things go awry, there's very, very little risk to them personally.

Good question - each private key has an associated public key.  The public key can either be compressed, or non-compressed.  The difference between the two is that in the compressed form, the Y coordinate is not stored explicitly, but can instead be derived from the X coordinate and a sign bit.  This saves some storage on the blockchain, but also results in different addresses (which are derived from a hash of the public key).
So by pointing out that they are all derived from compressed public keys, anybody who wants to take a stab at it, can effectively halve the workload as they don't have to test for non-compressed outputs.
( For the curious - yes, this means that any valid private key thus has two addresses. )

The hope of out-propagating goes down with this change in place.  Don't get me wrong, I think relying on zero confirmations is problematic at best, but depending on the state of the network it can be made a calculated risk.
Granted, with this change in place (and if ubiquitous on the network), it's still a calculated risk.. just that the calculation becomes "we can no longer accept zero confirmation transactions" or "well maybe waiting 3 minutes is enough? 5 minutes? apply headache directly to the forehead"
My point was more that by running XT, you get *all* of the changes - you don't get to pick and choose - and making it seem like only block size is affected (and xtnodes.com is guilty of this as well, stating only "supporting bigger blocks") is a tad disingenuous.

We haven't passed any fork point yet - so for now it's the same blockchain, and thus the difficulty is the same regardless of which of the two pieces of node software is feeding the miners.

I have one other suggestion: If you're currently mining at AntPool, F2Pool, BTC China or BWPool, consider mining at a solo pool, kano's ckpool, btcdig, eligius, slush or any other small mining pool, or even p2pool.  Arguments about subsidized electricity etc. don't even come into play when somebody's just pointing their self-hosted hardware at a large pool for sake of payout stability at the expense of centralization of mining power.

The theory is that one of the forks would die a quick death, making it a non-issue except in that short transitional period.  Note that before that there's already been additional transitional periods where voting approaches a threshold, and the result of voting takes hold, so nobody should be surprised by the forking event itself.
In the exceedingly unlikely case that both forks are viable and thus hold viable chains that are supported by sufficient users, services, miners, etc. then any coin that existed before the fork would indeed exist on both forks.  What the effect of that would be is unknown; i.e. it could become worth less on both forks, or code could be introduced that requires coins to be moved (any 'bagholder' not paying attention would get burnt) in order to make it valid on one fork and one fork only.

1b. Additionally, a node being first to relay the transaction to you may not be the first node to have seen it, even if you could connect to all the nodes, as in practice the first node to see the transaction may have more latency to you than e.g. the second node.  
1c. Basically it relies on odds.
2a. Your public key is not submitted in the clear until you make a payment - until then, a hash (RIPE-MD160) is what is provided; at least in typical transactions.  
2b. Knowing the public key isn't that terrible - a lot of cryptographic messaging systems rely on a public key being available.  
2c. That said, yes, they could correlate (see 1a,b,c) an IP address to a Bitcoin address.  There's reasons why you shouldn't (most of which subject to 1a,b,c), but having done this before to see if some mining pools could be identified that way, some correlation gives pretty high confidence.
3a. Yes, people can always use anonymizing services.  Be that on their network connectivity (Tor, basic proxy, VPN, etc.) or on how the transaction is performed.  
3b. I have no idea if any changes were made to the networking code in terms of what information leaks through.  I do somewhat remember that this wasn't a simple or particularly cheap vector, though I wouldn't rely on that if complete anonymity is a concern.

Sort of.
If they want to support XT's block size increase parts, they have to 'vote' as much by setting the block version to a number that includes specific bits set: 0x20000007
The XT code checks if those bits are set, and if so, counts that as a vote in favor.  If those bits aren't set - e.g. block version == 3 - then that's not a vote in favor.
So miners cannot say they'll support XT and at the same time support Core within the same block.  But they could vary the number of blocks in which they cast such a vote vs the number in which they don't.  Not sure why they would, but alright.
Right now though, most miners are not even using that block version mechanism.  Their statements in favor of a larger block size are either public statements (twitter, mailing list, etc.) and/or through their coinbase scriptSig.. be that through BIP100's /BVsizeinbytes/ proposal or by dropping '8M' somewhere.  These should also only be interpreted as public statements, as BIP100 has not been implemented, nor has any other code that takes these signature statements into account.

Two groups of developers ultimately couldn't reach an agreement on a change in code.  One group will continue working on Bitcoin as it was yesterday, and the other is working on a Bitcoin as it could be - a code forking event that technically took place a while ago already but now includes the change in question.  
If enough people/services/miners start using it then the two more or less become incompatible with each other; a block chain forking event - but that would be a good bit further into the future, if at all.  
If you'd like to learn more, I highly recommend searching - though try using Google instead of the built-in search :)

see: 
1.  Some of them are ("BIP100"), some more may be ("/BVsizeinbytes/"), and several others are not ("8M/" etc.)  
2. In theory, yes - January 11th, 2016, same as BIP101  
3. In theory, yes - the proposal suggests a mechanism similar to that used in BIP34, which was the block version approach.
4. Starts off at 1MB, miners can then vote using /BVsizeinbytes/ up to 32MB.  Another hard fork could then be approached to lift the 32MB limit.  
5. a: Maybe, b: probably.  Explained further in the follow-up paragraphs.
Right now, there's no code in the wild that actually implements any of BIP100.  The answer to question 3, for example, is that it would probably use the block version for a vote - however, no block version or version bitset is suggested in the proposal.  In essence, the proposal is incomplete in terms of fostering an implementation.  See:  .  Basically, it's a work in progress, and Jeff hopes to have something closer to a proposal that can be formalized and implemented soon.
Because of this, the answer to question 5(a) is that, right now, it's not likely that BIP100 is voted into effect because there's technically no voting mechanism at this time.  Miners who are signing their coinbase scriptSig with 'BIP100' are at best lending support to some form of BIP100.  
The question to 5(b) being 8MB is based on those miners who are using the '/BVsizeinbytes/' signature in their coinbase scriptSig, as suggested in the BIP100 proposal.  the 'sizeinbytes' has been '8000000' for most blocks (maybe all, haven't checked in a while).

1. there is no new fork  (edit for clarification: There's a software fork, not a blockchain fork, mining against either of the node software in question will perform work on the exact same blockchain)  
2. I have not yet seen a pool use alternate software (or at least aren't transparent about it), so your best bet would be to run the node software yourself, and point your miner at your own node.  Google 'solo mining' for information and instructions.

I guess finding an answer depends on what sort of technical reason you're looking for.  There's certainly no *technical* reason it can't be unlimited.  Make it so, see what happens; but there's plenty *conjecture* as to why that would be bad.. be it bandwidth or pools colluding in some way or people no longer running nodes because who the heck wants to fully validate a 1GB block that's got nothing but dust transactions in it, etc.  But something being arguably bad is not a technical reason not to do it.

That's part of the specification for voting the size, not for putting BIP100 into effect (though it may very well serve that dual purpose, that's not specified).  You'll notice further that "Votes are evaluated by dropping bottom 20% and top 20%, and then the most common floor (minimum) is chosen" (the remainder of that point) is something that still hasn't been cleared up.
There's a reason Jeff's still working on the details :)
@_date: 2015-08-27 17:56:19
The closest to 'detail' in the proposal as of v0.8.1 is page 6, point 7:


However, this does not specify in what way it is similar, and in what way it is dissimilar, and if in fact very similar in terms of e.g. using the block version to cast a vote, does not specify what that block version should be.
So no, it does not have a voting mechanism *specified*.

Unfortunately there's no way to verify that pools wouldn't be colluding or - if attempting to put a limit on hash rate in place - splitting themselves up into smaller entities.
As for the biggest single-location mine: nope, no idea - there's just no solid numbers.
If I had to continue with the assumption that it's probably BitFury at this point, then... the past month they've had about 15% of the network.  The network's been around 380Ph/s in that period, so 57Ph/s total.  Assume an even split between their two main locations (Iceland and Georgia) that would give 28.5Ph/s per mine.  Approximately with a huge margin and a hefty dose of salt.

blockchain.info is - once again - having technical difficulties (to put it mildly).  People are upset because of the 'once again' factor.  Given that your transaction may or may not be caught up in that, which in turn means it may or may not ever get confirmed, odds are you'll be one of those people soon enough.
On the up side, if the transaction gets dropped, you can always try resubmitting it or just making a new transaction - either with bc.i when they've got things fixed, or with a different service / local wallet software.

1. Against an address? No.  They have seized funds, of course, but that's against the person and the person has to produce those funds.  Just as they would identify X amount of cash in safe Y (if they know about it), they can identify X amount of Bitcoin spendable from Y.
2. They could, but hopefully somebody would clue the courts in about how that wouldn't work; they can require the Core developers to change Bitcoin Core - put in some code that makes certain transactions unspendable by any clients built from that code -  but that doesn't mean other people in the network are also going to incorporate those changes.
3. If court-ordered, and they've lost all their appeals or are required to act upon the order even while appeals are working their ways through courts, they have two options... A. defy the order out of principle and say hello to further legal procedures that only end in tears. B. comply and let the facts of point 2 run their course.
I'd say look at some court cases regarding copyright infringement, especially those that deal with sites centered around bittorrent.  Courts can, and have, demanded sites block certain content (leading to inevitable shutdown because who really goes there for their linux distros, no visitors - no ad income, etc.) or shut down entirely.. and the sites will generally comply; but it does nothing to actually stop the copyright infringement.

1. Extra security.  If one is broken, there's still the other.
2. Because Base58Check is an encoding.  If it was just the Base58Check of the public key, then the public key would be easily revealed by reversing the Base58Check encoding.  See discussions about address re-use on the potential pitfalls of knowing the public key.
3. Base58 because it removes the ambiguous characters, Base58Check because it provides some level of protectio against making typos through the checksum.

There was some sort of specification in BIP100, using "/BVxxxxxxx/" where xxxxxxx(x) sets the size in bytes.  ~~The twitter in question seems to have missed this~~ *obviously not, as that's how KnC's putting in theirs*, as that's how F2Pool used to vote.  Then others started doing their own thing with /8M/ or just throwing '8M' in there at random.   Antpool is also inconsistent - not all of their nodes are adding the 8M, for example.
Edit:   


“/BV8000000/” to vote for 8M.

Another interpretation is to use block version to vote BIP100 into effect, and /BVsizeinbytes/ to vote on the size.

Right (although there's some use cases where I can see ⅓ being more appropriate than just writing 1/3) - but just because you *can* combine glyphs, should you?
Moreover, in the case of a Bitcoin symbol, is it appropriate?
Both are not well-supported by fonts/renderers - one because it's not implemented, and the other because updating fonts to support this is a lot of work.
But for those fonts that do already support it, but yield an unsatisfactory result, or don't support it but do support the required glyph and may have found use where a given depiction is already expected, should we want to address designers to adjust their existing fonts (to A. fix non-combination issues and/or B. make B⃦   specifically render nicely) just for 'us'...
...or might we just as well pursue an entry in the unicode tables with appropriate description and example depictions, and work with designers to fit that symbol into their typeface's style from the get-go?
If just pursuing the path of least friction, Ƀ is a better option (Android apparently not displaying it notwithstanding).

How so?  Whether they'd be voting 1.9x on 10 blocks requiring 1.9x as difficult a hash, or whether they'd be voting 1x (or invalid) on 9 blocks and 10x on 1 block requiring 10x as difficult a hash for that block, there's a cost in having to find more difficult block(s) either way?


Not sure I'm following that one\*


Gotcha.  \* Still not entirely clear on how a miner would adjust the target outside of the 2016 retargeting interval though.
Within the interval, though, I guess it could already be problematic?  For simplicity say all the miners vote for 2x.  This requires 2x the difficulty.  That would make the interval between blocks 2x as long as well, and thus make the retargeting period 2x as long.  That would then be interpreted as the network hash rate having halved, and the next retarget would half the difficulty.  That would at least influence the target, but not outside of the retargeting interval.  Is that what you were alluding to, though?
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:38:12
Sorites paradox: at what point does a codebase with adjustments become an altcoin?  
Is a codebase that makes those adjustments active based on consensus by definition precluded from being labeled an altcoin?
Example: Somebody forks the Bitcoin code, and in addition to the regular SHA256d hashing for mining, it also implements hash algorithm Z.  For every block, it favors solutions based on Z - displacing SHA256d blocks if Z came in after that block, but before the next block.  Should consensus (based on typical N of last M blocks) be reached that Z is preferred, the code is set up to start rejecting SHA256d blocks.  
Is that then the new Bitcoin, or is it an altcoin from the moment its code is proposed?

Because miners can artificially inflate the block size with junk transactions, or deflate it by simply not including transactions.  Making the code co-dependent on the mempool would help fight the latter, but wouldn't do much against the former.  It would also make the assumption that the node(s) in question are honest; one could spin up a thousand well-connected nodes that all report that there have been very few transactions, for example.
@_date: 2015-08-03 16:58:56
Yes, but they're asking about a single device.  A lot of the people mining at solo pools are actually mining using multiple devices.  There was even a short time over on BitcoinTalk where a few regulars would pitch in together to rent hashrate off of a cloud mining type site, and point that to a solopool.
Short of taking miners' words for it, there's no way for a pool to ascertain if mining is being done with a single, or multiple devices, for the vast majority of apparent hash rates.
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:02:24
In a truncated mean you truncate and then take the mean.
That fits the truncation part "dropping bottom 20% and top 20%", but does not fit "the most common floor (minimum)".
Anything that fits the "most common floor (minimum)" definition, in turn, would not need truncation off the top.
It could very well be that Jeff meant a truncated mean; but that's not what is written :)

On the one hand I agree - as a lot of resources regarding XT focus entirely on the block size issue without explaining the fork that it would create or any of the other changes that are in the software that take effect immediately.
On the other, people should always check what they're getting into with any product.  Certainly around here, a lot of the discussion about XT has actually been focused on the fork, rather than the technical (lack of) merits of the changes within.
Ultimately, XT's thresholds are such that when one threshold  (last 750 out of 1000 blocks in favor) is likely to be reached within a foreseeable future, press coverage should serve as the final heads-up to those who might otherwise have been living under a rock.
In the mean time, try and educate people.. without being partial.  I'm not in favor of the exact mechanics of BIP101, but mud-slinging doesn't help :)

If you're a user of Bitcoin-XT, then you've already explicitly given your acceptance to any and all parameters that Bitcoin-XT uses.  If you're a user of Bitcoin-XT, you're part of what would be driving the fork forward in the first place.  No 'virus' here, let alone lawsuits.

The fixes it proposes however necessitate a split.  Can you really speak of the intent to fix while ignoring the split?  To me it seems that if any change requires a split, then the split is part of the intent.
The intent of a code fork that uses hash algorithm Z might be 'to fix the centralization problem caused by the ASIC-friendly SHA256d algorithm' - so if I had to go by what you've said here, you would classify this as being Bitcoin.  Is that correct?
As for "doom people" - I'm not sure I understand that part.  Whether Bitcoin-XT is labeled "Bitcoin with fixes", "forkcoin", "altcoin" or "The greatest scourge in the cryptocurrency landscape right now" doesn't preclude in any way the possibility of (compiling and) running its codebase.  I feel like this may have referred to (perceived or otherwise) censorship, but that's a completely different thread.

as long as their node and/or API isn't doing anything funky, that looks like it'd be correct.  I haven't seen any up to block 369552, but maybe after 0.11A goes 'official' some miner will try using it.

In defense of that, though, the Italian Lira would still be denoted as ₤ and the French Franc as ₣ in publications that'd feel like using a symbol (rather than just DM, F and L).  So even if Bitcoin gets replaced some time down the road, that doesn't preclude the legitimacy of such a symbol :)

Without knowing the details - I can't.  If your *transaction* has been included in a *block*, and that block was e.g.  (as of this time at height-2), then it should indeed have a few confirmations.
If, instead, you're looking at just your transaction (edit: which it seems you are), then maybe it hasn't been included in a block (yet), and so would read zero confirmations at any service.
Edit: as for the numbers, hover over the question mark; that gives a rundown

You are mistaking BIP100 for BIP101 (XT).  In BIP100, the version number doesn't change.  BIP100 hasn't been formalized, but you can see that they're voting for BIP100 in the coinbase scriptSig:  
  
Look for the line "/BIP100/Mined by guiyang828" in the decoded bit.
Before, starting at block 361095, they used "/BV8000000/" (as suggested in BIP100) as well:  
@_date: 2015-08-11 01:06:22
Smoothly? No.  Quickly?  Depends.  Software-side: Absolutely, presuming the algorithm itself is vetted for use in Bitcoin. Every place in the code where a SHA256 hash needs to be calculated is basically a call to a function.  Add a new hashing algorithm, search&amp;replace with the new call.  Hardware-side: Well unfortunately that's primarily ASICs nowadays - can't exactly reprogram those.  Working under the assumption that somehow this 'crack' would affect the mining process as well (e.g. you could reliably 'pick' an input to get a given output), then all that hardware suddenly becomes pretty pointless as everybody with an Arduino can start mining at apparent breakneck speed with no difficulty adjustment being able to properly compensate.  So that, too, would likely need changing, and with it would likely come a whole new era of CPU mining, FPGA/GPU mining, and - if profitable enough to bother with it again - ASICs.
As brokedown alludes to, though, if SHA256 is broken... there's going to be a lot more problems on the interwebs that would make issues with Bitcoin be a fair bit down the "oh sh-!" list.
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:55:26
Note that this is literally the coinbase scriptSig including "BIP100".  The BIP100 proposal also suggests a method for voting on the actual block size via the example "/BVsizeinbytes/".  This is the only proposal to do so.  Pools that sign their coinbase scriptSig could thus also be seen as being in favor of BIP100, although the link is weaker than a specific "BIP100" mention.
Pools that use "/BVsizeinbytes/" include KnCMiner and 21 Inc.
Between them and the aforementioned pools, based on the past week of blocks, this constitutes ~59.4% of the hashing power.
Do keep in mind that these are merely public expressions, and not actual votes.  BIP100 has not yet been formalized and no specific BIP100 voting mechanism described, let alone implemented.  This is something that Jeff Garzik is working on and will have ready soon™

I don't think any of the 8MB ones should be.  You're thinking of the BIP101 blocks that are indicated as voting for BIP101 via the block version number.  And for those, there's no indication in the blockchain itself to show that it was from no-XT.  At best you could try to correlate an IP address to the block and then probe at that IP address for peculiarities that would separate no-XT from XT (everything else should spoof XT).
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:11:03
It's not that it's impossible - it's just improbable.
There's nothing stopping the Bitcoin Core (pretty much the reference code) developers from putting in particular transactions that cannot be spent further.  They could even put in code that polls for a list of transactions that shouldn't be spent further from a centralized location, or even put in consensus rules.
There's equally nothing stopping people from then using an alternative codebase that does not include such changes.
I have no idea bout feathercoin, but I do know that the vericoin devs solved one case of a lot of stolen coin by deciding to perform a hard fork at a point before the fraudulent transactions, thus making it as if those never happened (to those on the new fork, of course).
Something like that seems unlikely to be performed for Bitcoin - but never say "never" :)
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:52:46
Nope, but it could be done if either fork felt like it had an advantage.  Retailers could also look at the age of an input and decide that pre-fork coins are only worth half as much or whatever other cockamanie idea that pops into people's heads in the unlikely scenario of two viable chains :)
@_date: 2015-08-14 23:15:21
But if crackers are made explicitly aware that there's a wallet that is at least conceivably a target for cracking, they might try to focus their effort.  That doesn't tell one much about crackers evolving their tools in general use.
Perhaps it'd really have to be two separate things.  As it is, there's a lot of variables that crackers may or may not take into account, some of which are a bit annoying to even take into account.
I think I'll at least keep my small-scale test initially secret and not take anybody else's money directly.. don't want to manage people's funds for something like this unless I could devote proper rigour to it.

1. Correct, Jeff is working on it:  
2. True for any proposal where somebody votes.  You'd need to make sure that the 'somebody' can vote anonymously first and make it provably impossible for anybody to deduce that the 'somebody' voted as instructed (e.g. pay of 100 people to "vote for X", after voting, if there are 99 votes for X you can't determine who didn't vote for X.  But if there are 0 votes for X, you can determine that none of them followed your bribe.)
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:24:33
For context:  (v0.8.1)
I didn't suggest that the 8MB votes should be interpreted as BIP100.  I think the only ones that can even remotely be interpreted as such are those signed "BIP100" (because I'm not sure how else one would interpret that), and those signed "/BVsizeinbytes/" as that's straight out of the proposal.  The ones with "8M/" or "X supports 8M" etc. aren't adhering to any proposal I know of.
The road to adoption in BIP100 is only alluded to as being "accomplished in a manner similar to BIP 34".  Even presuming that he just meant the mechanism used in BIP34 straight out, note that there isn't any proposal for what version or bits set would be required.
I think it may be a matter of interpretation, though.  Have they 'adopted' BIP100?  Technically, no, as there's nothing to adopt at this time (unless I missed something and there's a codebase around that actually implements things and has well-defined data).  At the same time, are they stating their intent that they would prefer BIP100 over X?  I would say 'yes'.
At the moment I feel that the "BIP100" scriptSigs are more an explicit expression of "we don't want BIP101" than anything.
@_date: 2015-08-20 19:05:50
That is correct - as long as both forks of the chain are viable, there would essentially be two economies and/or a whole lot of special-case handling.  Which, to me, is one of the reasons why I doubt both chains would be viable for very long, but for a different point of view, see:

What makes you certain you can run an exe in 50 years?  While a binary (Casascius' old utility supports it, if you absolutely must have a Windows executable) is convenient, if you're really trying to think long term you should keep a copy of the BIP itself and some easily-understood source code around.  There are also browser-based BIP38 implementations online where you can download the page and it'll happily run without any internet connection.

Right, like I said, you'd have to do some digging for arguments back and forth over whether or not this is actually a concern for miners or whether they're just doing things wrong in the first place.
Here's their statement in English which isn't too much more informing, but the thread comes with a good bit of discussion: 
8MB I think initially came out of the analysis by Gavin Andresen that started off with the 20MB but was later cut down:   
So while not entirely arbitrary, there's some reasoning behind it - as well as schedules going further into the future.
@_date: 2015-08-12 00:13:04
Just to expand a bit on my earlier reply: while bigger block sizes - and 8MB in particular - are probably supported by the mentioned pools in their entirety, in terms of voting with blocks, it's a smaller percentage.  Antpool doesn't include the '8M' mention in all their nodes, for example.  F2Pool's last scriptSig 'vote' was in block 363659.  Their next block doesn't have it, and their New Horizons/Pluto bit got all mangled.
Out of 8390 blocks since the first block (that I checked, block 361095 by F2Pool) that included a block size vote.. 2305, or just over 27%, had a vote for 8MB\*  
Out of the last 1000 blocks (counting back from 369484), there were 296 or about 30%.
\* Based on unique mentions of "/BV(.*)/" - all captures were '8000000' - '/8M', '8M/' and ' 8M' (because who needs consistency? ).  I could find no apparent mentions of other block sizes (e.g. 1M, 500K, 10M, 20M, 1000000, etc.)
As mentioned elsewhere, though, these 'votes' aren't much good without software actually doing something with it - and even then, the semi-recent block version snafu shows that actions really do speak louder than words.
@_date: 2015-08-06 15:13:52
I mean that the "ePay Weekly Mass Payout" note is not for the transaction from 08/05 that includes your address, but for the transaction below it from 08/02.  It is unrelated.
@_date: 2015-08-04 22:39:46
almost anything can be changed directly, except for the block version (too low or too high = rejected), the previous block hash, the target.  Which, in the header, means there's only the timestamp and the nonce that can be adjusted directly.  The merkle root can be adjusted by changing the content of the block, but cannot be changed arbitrarily or it wouldn't be valid for the contents:
extranonce things aren't technically 'fields', they're just defacto standard ways of adjusting the coinbase scriptSig.  Adjusting that effectively adjusts the header.  
timestamp:  


Note that the timestamp difference can also easily be caused by nodes that don't sync time particularly well.  The times a block are received at a node do tend to be more stable than the timestamps claimed on the blocks, e.g.  
[368409]( -- 17:50:52 vs 17:43:53  
[368410]( -- 17:47:40 vs 17:49:33
transactions: yes - and yes: plenty of blocks that don't include any transaction (other than the coinbase one)

No problem :)  I vaguely recall there is (was?) one block size limit that's not the hard-coded 1MB but rather a limit of the value type used... but that again would be something that could be adjusted.  Wish I could find it, was somewhere in a discussion about it being changed to 1MB in the first place.  Could probably just check the code though :)

See: 
BIP101 is what's implemented in XT (but should not be construed as being XT unless that's what their node is actually running - it could be the 'only big blocks' build or even spoofing)
BIP100 written literally as "BIP100" is technically invalid.  It's an endorsement of BIP100 without making any statement as to intended size.
BIP100 is a /BVsizeinbytes/ style vote as proposed in BIP100.  Note that while at the moment all of these are 8MB, it *is* an arbitrary number
8MB is a pool sticking "8M/", "8MB/" or even just "8M" somewhere in their coinbase scriptSig.  This doesn't adhere to any standard - just gives the pools more space for other things (internal data, scriptSig message services like AntPool and BTC China's, etc.)
@_date: 2015-07-06 11:14:20
They could already be checking the validity in the mean time, just as they're building work with transactions included while starting out with a coinbase-only block.  But if their miners find the block *before* this check has been completed, they're not going to wait for that to announce the block having been mined or they'll just risk having an orphaned block again.

If you found his answer unprofessional, there's betters ways to convey that than to give lip.  Then again, earlier he stated "There is no answer to your question, because I do not live in your false dichotomy." (that part of the discussion is missing).

Edit 2:  
At 2:37:03 you asked Luke-jr how XT is an altcoin, and he gives you a reasonably solid answer (anything not following the same consensus rules and as long as there isn't more than one viable chain)  
At 2:44:35 you asked s7r, and he also gives you a reasonably solid answer (anything not following the same consensus rules)  
You later ask some semi-related questions of midnightmagic which he doesn't want to answer because you keep hammering on getting numbers.. e.g. number of nodes, number in hash rate.  At one point Luke-jr's "nobody significant wants to continue using it" is turned into 100% by you, and then later you say "You guys are not serious, can't hold any discussion. Just vague points.  Even Luke-jr can't define what altcoin is." and "This is just joke".  Even though earlier he told you how he defines an altcoin.
At that point, I can well-imagine people's frustration.  Do I think you should have gotten banned?  No.  I think they could have made their point a bit more clearly, and midnightmagic might have explained what false dichotomy he felt you were presenting.  On the other hand, given the conversation up to the last screenshot, I don't think you would have accepted those further explanations any more than you did the answers you had already gotten, and would probably have gotten the boot anyway.

Won't make you rich - might not even break even at a regular pool - but you can always try playing the lottery at a solo pool.  If that's not your kind of thing, then again: what b44rt said :)

Short of third party initiatives (like bitnodes' incentive program) - they don't.  Some people run them for fun, some people run them because they feel it's necessary to keep things decentralized, some people run them because they center their services around them.  There's no inherent monetary reward for running one.

Apparently you can't use webfonts (e.g. through  in a subreddit's styling, or that would have had my preference over an image.  You *can* set any font, and if the user has the font installed, it should display as intended, though - but that would require users to install said font.
I do think that any suggestion should have a graceful fallback that doesn't necessarily rely on the CSS to work at all.  So e.g. [BTC]() (if that can be detected) might work.  Perhaps some inspiration can be had from the spoiler alert CSS implementations?

The idea is fine - but almost nobody's going to be on board with that.  Try convincing somebody currently using e.g. Antpool to instead use BitMinter or something (Slush is currently gaining popularity though, so there is that.. even if it is at the cost of the operator having to run a zero-fee pool for a bit).
So now imagine trying to get people to join even smaller pools and having them keep those pools small, instead of chasing the lower variance associated with larger pools.
As for single largest mining farm... define a 'farm'.
I'd imagine BitFury's in Georgia is pretty impressive, but that's not their only location.. so are we counting their whole thing or just per location?
There's also no telling how much of Antpool is Bitmain's own mine and how much of it is public users.

Miners do it because the protocol requires it.  If they only did it once, anybody trying to verify (using double SHA256) would declare that miner's result as incorrect.
As for why the protocol requires it, there's speculation that it's to help guard against Birthday paradox attacks:   
( Googling 'bitcoin why double sha256' yields many articles, by the way. )
As an aside, just to get a bit technical, miners don't actually have to complete two full rounds of SHA256.  They can skip a few steps at the end that don't affect the output in a way that matters for fast mining purposes (host controller always double-checks output for validity anyway, so rather than waste time on the ASIC all the time, 'waste' a little bit of time on the controller far less frequently)

No.  Sorry, it's that simple - Bitcoin mining ASICs do one thing and one thing only, and that's hashing for mining.  It cannot be used for speeding up vanity address generation, it cannot be used to try and attack SHA256-based passwords, it cannot be used as a generic SHA256 hasher.
You *could* do it with an old FPGA miner, however.  But then you might as well look into OpenCL and such and use a GPU unless the FPGA solution has distinct advantages :)

Transactions can be pretty much anything as long as they're a valid script.  P2PKH - the kind you see as Bitcoin addresses starting with a 1 - and P2SH - starting with a 3, are two of the most popular general use scripts, while a transaction with only OP_RETURN (and optional arbitrary other data) is a popular script to try and store metadata on the block chain, for example.

Yes-and-no.  Just because something is not in unicode doesn't really stop people from using it in running text *if* they can easily add it in running text.  That's where a part of the problem lies (see also one of my other comments on this chicken&amp;egg issue).
Perhaps more should be done to 1. Clean up the .TTF we have (optional but might as well while at it), 2. tell the world that it's free to use, 3. make sure it's hosted somewhere where people can easily  it in their CSS, 4. show examples of how easy it could be to include, e.g. a piece of javascript that automatically replaces any mention of "BTC" leading or trailing a number - as even inclusion into the unicode tables doesn't mean fonts are updated overnight.

Each proposal can have their own voting mechanism.  BIP34 had one using the block version.  That same mechanism was used in BIP66, and BIP101 uses a similar approach in that it also levies the block version.  I'm not sure if that counts as 'uniform', but at least it's there :)  
BIP100 would likely use the same sort of mechanism, but as it hasn't been formalized, it can't be said for certain.

I think 21, Inc. was the latest to join the group voting via /BVsizeinbytes/ for 8MB.
One thing to keep in mind is that this isn't very organized.  Antpool, for example, have stated they're in favor of 8MB.  However, a good chunk of the nodes they mine against are not signing their coinbase scriptSig as such.
Similarly, F2Pool used to sign their scriptSig with the /BVsizeinbytes/, but whether intentional or through a snafu (their New Horizons distance from Pluto thing broke erliear as well), no longer does so.  However they've given no indication they no longer support 8MB blocks.

BIP100 is currently not being taken into account other than that there are some sites that tally these indications; they're technically not votes, as BIP100 does not have a voting mechanism specified.
BIP101 votes are counted by clients that implement BIP101, e.g. Bitcoin XT or Bitcoin Core with the 'only big blocks' patch.  The votes to activate BIP101 are cast via the block version.  The BIP101 code triggers when 750 of the last 1000 blocks have the specified block version.  For details, I'd recommend you read the BIP101 specification.

Of which miners?
The network at large?  The block chain itself is your friend.  You can estimate - from block intervals and the difficulty of each block - what the network hash rate should have been.  Just google 'bitcoin historic hashrate' and you should get several sites that'll graph it up for you.  Edit: See hablamanos2's link for an example.
Of pools?   for current and semi-historic stats.  Blockchain.info goes a bit further back.  organofcorti.blogspot.com goes back a long way along with analyses.
Of specific miners?  Probably can't be done for the majority, as the majority go through pools with current and/or historic hashing stats not public or at least not archived in any way, and deriving from pool payouts is not an easy task as many of these transactions are fairly opaque.
@_date: 2015-08-27 23:41:13
Perhaps good to note in the summary is that they switched from "/BVsizeinbytes/" (specifically, 800000) to "/BIP100/" in their coinbase scriptSig.  As the "/BVsizeinbytes/" was only proposed in BIP100, one could infer that they were backing BIP100 already.

Difficulty as we know it may not even apply to an alternative PoW.. but presume it did.. then no, it wouldn't necessarily need to be reset; depends on how the PoW change would be implemented.  A scalar could be applied during a time of PoW algorithm overlap.  Messy though.

Can they really be called victims when it's their own doing?
It's also not a $50k loss, it's $50k they didn't get - which would have to be offset against how many blocks they would have expected to mine if they had been on the right chain and been fully verifying as per their own agreement.
Regardless, they don't 'continue mounting' except for any operator living under a rock.
Any 'victims' here would be users who sent transactions that ended up getting included in one of those wrong fork blocks and acted upon just a few blocks' confirmation.

Not that strange, but certainly neat that they managed to have a CRC that not only is a word, but that could be argued to make sense within the rest of the address.
Google 'eater address' or 'burn address', there's a few utilities that will let you generate things like the well-known "1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE".
Somebody must have written a bit of code that not only takes the first part and adds the CRC code, but additionally permutates the case of the first part - and perhaps tries various dictionary words for a second part (the 'bringing') - and lists all results where the CRC is additionally a word in the dictionary file.
Similarly (something from a test I did a while back just trying random words with each word's first letter capitalized) that's how you might get "1NarcissistSnowshedHarmerAteGoTerm" or "1MangoDismayedBroadswordChopRanBat"
As pgrigor points out, though, generating addresses this way means you do not have a matching private key.  It's also exceedingly unlikely that somebody would *find* a matching private key.

Hi,  Not-Jeff here!
Click on each block, then click the coinbase transaction (first-listed), then scroll down to read the decoded coinbase scriptSig.  You'll see a pattern: the blocks signed as "Mined by AntPool usa" and "Mined by AntPool bj" are the ones that don't have the 8M-style vote.  Either intentional, or just an oversight, but it's really down to the node rather than miner choice :)

~~Can't say I've tried this, but~~ give this a shot... find a fork of the brainwallet site / visit the archive copy (can do the next bits offline if tinfoil hat applied): 
Convert from Base58 (not Base58Check) to Hex.
~~Now I *think* Bitcoin Core imports Hex private keys, but in case it doesn't,~~ switch on over to the Generator tab: 
Select "Secret Exponent" near the top, and then paste the hex private key into the Secret Exponent field.  You should then find a WIF private key in the Private Key field.  You will want to double-check that the address reported is correct.  If it is not, try the Point Conversion field from Uncompressed to Compressed.  If it still doesn't match, then all of this probably doesn't work as expected at all and somebody will have to post a better solution :D
Edit: Just confirmed that this procedure works.  Will check if Bitcoin Core imports hex keys next.  
Edit 2: Nope, it doesn't.  Even if it did, the command line has no option for specifying whether the associated public key should be compressed or non-compressed.

Yeah - question is if that's really a bad thing (fewer miners), or only in light of that making it easier for the network to be attacked... which is more likely to trigger a PoW change than a supply change, imho.  But that's for another thread :)

There may or may not have been DoS concerns - the commit that introduced the 1MB limit was not explained and apparently those who asked Satoshi about it were asked not to start pointing to it.  This was shortly after a large influx of new users, though, so DoS concerns (either from new users, or just exposure to more ne'er-do-wells) is a reasonable assumption.
One small but important correction to your first paragraph: the block size doesn't really matter too much for miners in terms of their hashing power.  Hashes are only calculated for the header anyway - so whether you're using a CPU, GPU, FPGA or ASIC, they all work only off of a very small amount of data that can represent just a handful of bytes or all the storage capacity in the world.  
Miners do care, on the other hand, about the block size in terms of their network bandwidth.  A Chinese pool in particular has mentioned that their current internet bandwidth was not sufficient to handle 20MB, but they'd be sort of okay with 8MB.  You can do some searching around for the details of how truthful this is, including a fair bit of analysis and recently some statements with regard to bandwidth rollout in China accelerating making it a non-issue even if they couldn't just pay out of their own pocket for a more decent pipeline out of a rural hydropower location to a proper hub.

The point he's trying to make is this... let's say you have address X.  You don't know who owns address X, it's not published anywhere except on the blockchain, there's no service-related tags a  la bc.i, etc.
However, address X then ends up being an input, along with address A, in a transaction.  And you do know who is associated with address A: Alice.
The simplest explanation for that scenario is then that Alice is also associated with address X.
Now let's say address X is later also used for a transaction to address B, and address B is a well-known address from Bob.  Now you could implicate that Alice made that transaction to Bob.
Whether or not that's something you'd care about is a different discussion :)
The less-simple explanations could also still apply, though.  Maybe address X is actually Carol's, and Alice gave away whatever funds were spendable from address A by giving Carol the private key directly, rather than sending as a transaction.  'Carol' in this case could be a trusted online service, for example (though her name would be Fay - oh, cryptonames..).  Or maybe address X is Eve's, who had dropped a piece of malware on Alice's computer and thus got access.  Etc.

BitcoinTalk and the bitcoin wiki both implement the Bitcoin symbol using a web font, replacing the letter B with the actual symbol, and the letters T and C blanked out.  In this use, [BTC] and {BTC} respectively are replaced with the symbol when available, or just the text 'BTC' when not / when copy/pasting as plaintext.  E.g. [BTC]25 becomes **B**25.  Examples of its use as such should be readily available at those two sites.
Examples in the wild are a bit more problematic; it's a chicken &amp; egg problem.. perhaps not even so much in terms of lack of a unicode symbol, but also in lack of presence on a keyboard, readily-ingrained alt+numbersequence (euro not on keyboard? 128), HTML entities (&amp;amp;euro;), etc. - though most of those would follow from having a unicode symbol in the first place.

Yes.  And they can't do what you're proposing (submitting a block to the network without the required nonce) because they need the full details of the block, which - certainly more often than not on modern hardware - will change as the nonce range is often exhausted long before a solution is found.

accept-language should only be used as a language hint, though.
Say you've got a French national newspaper that also publishes in english for its foreign visitors.  It looks at the header, sees the browser accept fr, and serves the French version.  Which, as a Frenchman, is great.. you would probably want the French version.
Now you come across a non-French site that has crappy translations into French.  It sees you accept en and fr, and it supports both, so it tries to do a little IP geolocation, puts you in Paris, and decides that fr it is.  Now you're being served a crappy translated site.
Which isn't a problem, as long as you can 1. switch the language and 2. that switch sticks (one of the few good uses for cookies).
The alternative is that you'd have to disable the 'fr' option in accept-language, but then that national newspaper might start offering up the English version of their site.
( There's extensions that let you set accept-language specifically, and others that let you set any header, to custom values per-site; but that's backwards. )

Saving a few seconds.
Basically, they don't need transactions to start mining.  So they get only the very least amount of information they need, fire it off to their mining farm to start mining.  In the mean time, they can start collecting transactions.  If, before they get to submit new work with these transactions, the farm mines the block - hurray.  If not, well then they'll just continue with a block *with* transactions - doesn't hurt them at that point.
Their competitor might think that's dodgy, so they always collect transactions before submitting anything to their farm.  Say this takes 10 seconds (thin air number, don't quote).
Presuming all other circumstances equal (e.g. hash rate, connectivity, etc.), guess who will win more blocks in the long run?
The answer is "what the point of that" is :)

Your question may be stemming from a bit of confusion and consequently may require a bit of clarification.
Are you asking about:  
A. different algorithms (ECDSA vs EdDSA)  
B. different curves (secp256k1 vs secp256r1)  
C. different private keys (really_long_hex_here vs really_long_but_different_hex_here)?
For C - which I feel is probably what you meant to ask - we know that the private key space is much, much larger than the (base58-encoding of the) RIPEMD160 hash of the sha256 hash of a public key, so there's bound to be an address that has more than 1 matching private key.  Good luck finding an example, though.
Edit: This stackexchange discussion has a bit more detail:

1. it's an estimation based on the block intervals - better estimators should exist somewhere that use pools' actual statistics to give a better view, but I think some pools stopped making that stuff public, so no idea if that can still be done to any degree of certainty.
2. the drop is for the 20th.. today is the 20th.. that doesn't help the above estimation any as variance could well mean that the estimator for the later part of the day would decide there's +200PH
3. regardless, these swings aren't out of the norm - switch to the 3 month view and check out May 23rd.  Switch to ALL and you'll see that as time goes on, the estimator's error becomes an increasingly large factor in absolute values.
So basically, it's unlikely that 100Ph/s actually did drop - though can't be sure without many more samples :)

That's one of the differences between Bitcoin and cash, though - Bitcoin can be traced relatively well.  Given a few tumbles and such things do get murky (unless one gets down to the nitty-gritty, but then semantics of whether Satoshi X is still the same Satoshi X start coming into play), but for ones that are straight from a miner or at least with verifiable steps inbetween, it's clearer than with cash taken from a bank and exchanged between anonymous hands.
That said, yes, some will find that this is a threat in some way to fungibility, similar to earlier proposed businesses like CoinValidation, and some people's ideas that 'Chinese Bitcoin' should be marked as such and let the market decide on whether or not they want to accept those.

Take whatever your input is, calculate a SHA256 hash of it; the result is your private key in raw hex.  Import that into any other wallet solution.
E.g. if you start with the archived version of the site:
Enter the string "hello world, this is my password", it'll tell you that the 'secret exponent' is "34ceb68e3f5a391198c450e1017a69866d0a9df6c3b9b32bf67783004ec9c5eb"
Now try  , enter the same string, and get as a result ... "34ceb68e3f5a391198c450e1017a69866d0a9df6c3b9b32bf67783004ec9c5eb" :)

Short: No.
Longer: The world's fastest super computers combined cannot compete with even a moderately sized Bitcoin mining pool using dedicated ASICs.  It certainly can outpace a single miner, but would be nowhere near as efficient.  Supercomputers are used for all sorts of simulations, usually ones that not only need to be fast but also need to deal with lots of data, like climate, macro economics and, yes, figuring out how things go boom without making them actually go boom.
If they wanted to mine all remaining coins, it would be much more economic for 'the Fed' to invest in development of dedicated Bitcoin mining ASICs on one hand, and/or using their broad overreach on the internet to block competing miners' traffic on the other hand.
On the third han.. should something like that occur - from either government or industry - there's plenty of developers who would seriously consider changing how mining works.

It's a bit of a cop-out, though.  It's taking the term 'technical'... technical.
It's a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine to say that it's technically not impossible for somebody to randomly generate a private key that matches your address, for example.  And it's true, that could happen - theoretically, at least, because the odds are so extremely against it that one might as well say that it's impossible at least in colloquial use.
The same applies to block sizes.. a 1GB block is technically possible, but practically speaking this would not be accepted.  Much of the discussion is thus to drive toward a solution that they further conjecture *is* acceptable.  Be that going down to 500KB, up to 2MB, 8MB, 20MB, do some gradual increase immediately or afterward, or let it be defined by prior block parameters so that it automatically adjusts up/down and if so, what parameters, etc. etc.
Much of the *debate*, on the other hand, has been mostly between hard-liners who either want no change until the aforementioned discussion comes to a conclusion (while acknowledging it might never do so), or want a very specific change as some sort of "it might not be exactly what we want, but at least it's not *your* proposal, so I'll take it" solution.
Stances like that always lead to conflict - which is unfortunate, as much of the earlier discussion was a lot more technical discussion with people doing proper analyses, trying to create models, etc., while lately it's been more about accusations of impropriety and ad-hominem attacks.
Anyway, /rant :)

are you suggesting that Payza summarily strikes KYC regulations from law, or is there something incorrect in their KYC process itself?
@_date: 2015-07-26 14:45:10
I'm not saying anybody should.  I'm saying it's an example where the assumption doesn't hold.  CoinJoin type transactions are another such assumption, and are arguably even more convoluted unless you have already established an existing relationship with somebody (or preferably multiple somebodies) with some level of automation in performing these joint transactions for the sole purpose of obfuscation.  Services, such as JoinMarket, make this easier - but it's still far from being a commonly accepted practice.
@_date: 2015-07-25 23:52:49
It's fairly reasonable reliance.  While I may not be fully grokking what you're saying, one can certainly make transactions that require more than one private key (multisig) or that don't involve addresses at all and require some other piece of information in order to further spend the bitcoin.

My main issue with the image is that it involves concepts that most people are ill-equipped to grasp.  How much is 'most of the natural resources in our star system'?  What is a dyson sphere?  Absolute zero?  *Expending* energy?  The list goes on and on.
For people who (somewhat) understand what it's about - it's a decent picture, and clearly popular.
Me, I've always been more fond of the single grain of sand hidden somewhere on the world's beaches analogy.  Neither are perfect, but anybody who's been near a beach can understand the difficulty of finding a particular grain of sand just in a bucket of sand, let alone the entire beach, let alone the world's beaches; and then hit them with the fact that they'd still stand a better chance of finding that grain of sand than they would finding the private key for a random given address.

One could argue that the address for a blank string brain wallet is sufficiently obvious and 'known enough' that it may just as well be part of public documentation somewhere and can thus be considered public in its own right.  The same might apply for e.g. "hello world" and "correct battery staple horse". But you're right that things do get increasingly arbitrary.
It's an interesting philosophical question, and one that some people feel should not be sought an answer for.  Here's comment on this topic, I find it insightful anyway: 
Perhaps it's best if people realize that they should be using strong brain wallets (if one is so inclined as to use a brain wallet in the first place), and while the question above remains unanswered should not be surprised if some people will happily take advantage of them if they use weak brain wallets.
( Quite a while ago I proposed that those who do want to use a brain wallet should add a simple extra step: hash their brain wallet.  This means remembering N words, and 1 hashing function - it relies on the attacker not knowing that you used a hashing function or that even if they do, they don't know which one, but that's still a lot stronger than using only dictionary words, which is the low hanging fruit attackers would go for. )

Is it ridiculous?  You yourself have identified a market, and while (again, see second paragraph) existing wallets would do well to cater to it - maybe it would be of interest to yourself to do so but you hadn't considered it.

The problem with that would be revealing the wallets - which might make an attacker actually put in funds to tempt others into doing the same...and then taking it all (see also comments further up).

Yes, but that, too, is a choice.

I haven't done the math exactly, but under this proposal, a 9.999MB initial vote (compared against the 1MB 'base block size limit') would also require the block's hash to be 9.999 times lower than the network target - meaning, optimistically, that any miner trying to vote as such would lose 9 out of 10 blocks.  So while they may adopt that strategy, it would come at a cost.
At least until the next 'base block size limit' is actually determined.  Let's say that miner's goal is to have 5MB blocks.  Presuming that 5MB is reached and everybody else is also voting 5MB, there's no hashing cost to anybody.  Presuming instead 3MB is reached, then this miner will still have to vote &gt;= 5MB, with associated hashing cost, if they want to try and make that happen.  Presuming finally that 7MB is reached, this miner can vote 5MB at no hashing cost.
One comment from mmeijeri in the repo points out:  


If I'm reading the proposal correctly, that wouldn't fly, as the miner cannot know in advance which block would be eligible for being 10% higher.  Thus if they wish to vote for 10% higher, they would always need to find blocks that have a hash that's (at least) 10% lower than the target, as any block where there's a vote for 10% higher but the hash is not 10% lower would yield a 0% change vote.
I do see what you're saying with the second paragraph, though.  Presuming a 1MB base, and they wanted 2MB, rather than voting 2MB twice (and thus requiring two blocks that are twice as difficult to find), they could vote 1MB/invalid and 3MB, requiring only a single block that is 3 times as hard.
Probably over-simplified, though?
It's an interesting approach for adding a cost to miners.  Because of the zero-cost for smaller block sizes, this does tend to favor smaller block votes.  Not sure if that's ideal either.

Sarcasm works better when it's not surrounding something that happens quite frequently :)  
There's pros/cons to any approach, and there's certainly nothing stopping people from setting up their service to use (verified) donation addresses as some sort of proof of payment to the service - but not everyone will agree that it is inherently better than burn addresses / provably unspendable funds, etc.
@_date: 2015-07-27 10:32:31
Given the giant chunk of 'unknown' at bitcoinity, I'd certainly trust bc.i over them.  There's always other sites for other pool attribution charts as well, e.g.

bitcoind is a background daemon version typically associated with the Bitcoin Core 'wallet'.
bitcoin-qt is the graphical user interface version of the same.
bitcoinj is a code library - which may get used by other wallets.  
bitcoinxt is another wallet that now includes some changes from Bitcoin Core.
bitcoinj and bitcoinxt share authors.

The point of most eater / trashcan / burn addresses is usually to prove that a certain amount of coin can never be spent again.  Some services use this as a type of payment, without enriching themselves, suggesting that in fact it enriches every use of Bitcoin (as the total number of spendable bitcoin goes down, the value of a unit of bitcoin goes up).  e.g. BitAlias uses 1BitALiasRegistryXXXXXXXXXXXYP9R77 as part of its internal workings.
Note that these coins aren't technically destroyed, it's just unfathomable that anybody has or could even find a private key that matches such an address.  There are other ways to 'destroy' coins that are truly provably unspendable.
@_date: 2015-07-20 22:42:02
Not *exactly* the same - their node(s) may not be connected to the same nodes and may get transactions in different order, or they may be configured differently to even ignore some transactions or drop them faster from their own mempool.
Bitcoin Core 0.11.0 increased the minimum transaction relay fee, so compared to the previous version, it may reject more transactions, thus never entering its mempool, for example.
@_date: 2015-07-28 13:23:18
I could have sworn bc.i had a timestamp of when the block announcement hit their node in their API output, but that appears to be missing for the vast majority of blocks now; wonder if they purged their db and only had the blockchain to rebuild from.  It does have that information for more recent blocks, back to block 366,754 (2015-07-24)
Blocktrail.com's API also has this information, but looks like theirs goes back to block 310,737 (2014-07-14), which is still rather recent.
In the end, though, unless you just want to see if a particular miner screws with the timestamp more often than others, or are just interested in other ephemeral statistics, it doesn't matter too much.  The halving, difficulty adjustments, etc. are based on block index, and not the timestamp.  The timestamp itself can further only 'lie' so much (  ), so even for our human curiosity of trying to guess as to when a next difficulty adjustment or reward halving occurs, there's very little impact given the large number of blocks involved for either of those.

The fiat comparison isn't quite apt, as they can (and do) always print more to make up for lost tender.
As for donating to charity - absolutely that would work.  Of course, that charity can then be hacked, extorted, etc. to give up the donated coin.  It also associates whatever service (purely as an example; BitAlias) with whatever charity (say, Red Cross) which can get political.

If I had a penny for every post that follows that format - be it for BFL, KnC, AMT, BA ... - I'd have, like, a lot of pennies.
Genuine question.. is it cathartic?  
Considering these companies are unlikely to ever respond to these types of posts, and have either already gone through the legal process (and conveniently gone bankrupt or got away with minor issues) or have no fear of any actual legal action (threats remaining hollow), posts like that seem to serve no particular purpose.  
The best I can argue is that it keeps others aware of potential issues with the company.  Even so there's plenty who have no issue getting into bed with them, usually due to bitcoin signs in the eyes.  BFL is still around and people mine at EclipseMC.  KnC is still around and people went all drooly over "Bitcoin XBT" (way to usurp terms) not so long ago.  Black Arrow is still chugging along even if it's just selling hardware wallets now and potential Scrypt stuff in the future.  Only AMT is actually gone - sort of.

There might be one - but I'm with Gregory on this one.. I'm not even going to specifically look.  The examples I mentioned I've just come across randomly several times, instilling in me the notion that they'd be public ...but just what degree of 'public'? :)
I do know that there *are* people who have such databases and will monitor for transactions that they can then pilfer.. either for their perceived good, or for evil, and those only exist because the concept of brain wallets is inherently less secure on a technical level than one that is based on an unfathomably large random number.
@_date: 2015-07-29 00:15:12
It somewhat depends.
The iDeal system itself is token-based, so the merchant should not be getting your bank account number.  However, this token or some identifier is undoubtedly stored, and the banks would know all the details, so it's pseudonymous at best.
However, if you trade more than €50 worth of Bitcoin, you're required to verify your bank account.  In that case, there's a more direct association with your real life persona via e-mail and (mobile) phone number.  See:  
I'm not too sure about the Dutch market - I think Bitonic is the  solution there.  I have traded via localbitcoins while in Amsterdam a few times, but rarely do so now.  In theory, that can be practically anonymous (tinfoil hat about security cameras and such aside).
Note that you can always send your purchased Bitcoin to a new address and nobody would really know if you just happened to make a purchase, or whether you control that address.  You can further obfuscate things by partnering with somebody else to make a transaction, but I'm sure all that is explained in any anonymity guides :)

Technically speaking, it could be 0-infinity hours.  It's also technically not quite random.
Realistically speaking, at least for blocks since January 1st, 2015, the block intervals look like this:    
Same thing on a log scale: 
So you can see that out of the 29300-odd blocks (didn't include that info in those graphs - oh well), very few even exceeded 1 hour.  Perhaps more easily visualized in larger bins and as a percentage of the blocks:

Except that it is, potentially, not fixed.  We're assuming that the pools got their act together (later a smaller pool already mined a v2 block again).  If those pools decided to misbehave (on purpose), the same situation could apply once more.

re: your comment here:  
because some miners - in particular in China - are on pretty crappy internet and they fear that large blocks will cause their mined blocks to be orphaned more often due to a variety of mechanisms.  However, they themselves got together (well, 5 of the large ones there) and agreed that 8MB would be okay.. at least in the foreseeable future. ..but not 20MB.
Note also that they specifically didn't want to get behind Bitcoin-XT because besides the block size bits, there's some other changes in there that they're less keen on, and regardless they'd prefer to stay on the rules of what is pretty much the reference client..currently Bitcoin Core.

I'm not sure which miners are selling direct in a verifiable way.  Blocktrail did announce their Mint service about 3 weeks ago which caters to what you're asking about, but they're still an intermediary:  
  
So basically, they're: coinbase -&gt; miner -&gt; Mint -&gt; buyer.
You're thinking of: coinbase -&gt; miner -&gt; buyer.
However, ideally for truly fresh coins, a service could be additionally set up to work together with solo miners / solo mining services to have payout to not just their addresses, but that of a buyer.  Then you would have:  
coinbase -&gt; miner -&gt; themselves + buyer (+ solo mining pool fee)  
That's the only way to have no transaction history associated with them; be a miner (or convince one to pay out direct to you in the coinbase transction).
The buyer would have to purchase with an unknown delivery time, though.. short of some fancy schemes, considering otherwise there's always at least one hop between the coinbase and the buyer.

And if that is, in fact, the appropriate approach - why not have a bot that posts this and other frequently-answered-but-rarely-searched-questions at said interval, giving said newbies a convenient place at or near the top of the list to find it?  Better yet, perhaps it could be put into the sidebar, in something called the FAQ, perhaps.

Oh I don't know, how about pretty much every major company out there because it's the law?


You don't talk to email clients - you talk to mail servers, and that hasn't changed in its core in years.  If anything, writing a new chat app is hell because everybody and their dog decided to go with their own protocol or at least variations on standards like XMPP and IRC and there you *do* need to talk to clients or a centralized server where you're at its whim; which includes not being allowed to communicate with it at all.


That's not even e-mail.  I thought we were building an e-mail client, not a productivity suite.  Let your e-mail client throw the calendar invite at the system and it'll pop up whatever program is designed to deal with those.  None configured?  Point the user to a program that can handle them, or indeed handle it yourself; but that's separate from e-mail issues.
So we finally get to the heart of the matter and that is using the block chain as a form of proof of identity.  Which, it doesn't work that way, but sure you could certainly tie it in with a secure messaging app (also already exists) for the usual account verification bits (which is the only example in the article).  Or companies could stop trying to do account verification, given that you can get a throwaway e-mail address just about everywhere.

To me it seems more like a symbiotic relationship - the issue would have to impact services quite a bit for them to decide to jump ship to a fork against the will of miners, while the fix would have to be quite detrimental to miners in order for them to go against the services.  I.e. let's say the PoW were modified, but it's modified not to address an issue that is severe, but as part of a typo fix - there's no incentive whatsoever for either miners or services to go along with that; if anything it would just invite a fork of the reference code with the typo fixed and everything else left intact.

3D printing cases is relatively expensive in materials, time, QA, etc.
In terms of Bitcoin enthusiasts, I'd say: who needs a case at all?  
But if you did want to go for a case, look at either existing cases that your device of choice / design could fit into and could optionally be customized, or look at injection molding.
It's things like these - a case, a (touch)screen, always-included storage (SD card or HDD) - that push the price of these hardware nodes up higher than strictly necessary.  $100 gets a person the latest Roku 3 - it's difficult to sell a piece of hardware that 'merely' acts as a Bitcoin node when put next to a streaming video box with built-in networking and wifi, external storage solutions, a remote, slick software, and so forth and so on.

that integer vs float seems to be the theme in this thread ;)
now..why isn't yours matching up... expanding a few equations here for clarity... 
Your fractional year for the first block seems to match - just to get some more significant numbers: 2009.0075629439
That number is based on:  
A: 2009/01/01 00:00:00 = 1230764400  
B: 2009/01/03 18:15:05 = 1231002905  
C: 2010/01/01 00:00:00 = 1262300400  
(B-A) / (C-A) = 0.0075629439
Each full era = 210,000 * 10 * 60s = 126,000,000  
D: B + 126000000 = 1357002905 = 2013/01/01 02:15:05  
E: 2013/01/01 00:00:00 = 1356994800  
F: 2014/01/01 00:00:00 = 1388530800  
(D-E)/(F-E) = 0.0002570079
Could you check what interim values you're seeing?  Might give some clues as to where the difference pops up - and which one's right/wrong.  Note that in actuality I'm using a spreadsheet's time difference function in days, but the values match up.
The next 3 values I've got are:

The work isn't actually split.  All the miners generally receive the same work (header + optional further data), but miners themselves can vary a few things, like the nonce value, time and in most modern protocols the  extranonce, etc.
The people using the pool hash away at the header(+data) and if the hash they find is below a certain threshold (the set pool difficulty), they send that in as a solution to the pool which checks if the submission is valid and, if so, adds a 'share' for the given difficulty.
Only when somebody finds a hash that is below the network difficulty does a block get found.
Depending on the pool, they may always pay out based on shares (PPS) or they may pay out based on the last bunch of shares when a block is found, or proportional to the number of shares out of the total number of shares that had been submitted, etc.
If you need to go even further down, look at e.g. the [stratum protocol]( [at wiki]( [getBlockTemplate]( and the older  [getwork](

misleading title.  It's a tweet *by* Jeff Garzik, addressed *to* Peter Todd.   This is Peter's tweet (bot in 3, 2, 1):  
@_date: 2015-09-25 23:24:53
Bitmain claim between 0.181J/Gh and 0.263J/Gh on their 28nm (depends on hash rate)  
Innosilicon/LK Group claim anywhere between 0.14J/Gh and 0.28J/Gh for their 14nm 
Spondoolies-Tech claim 0.14J/Gh on their 28nm  
21, Inc. claim 0.16J/Gh on their (probably) 22nm chip  
KnC claim 0.07J/Gh on their 16nm  
Not listing some likely scam ones, but they tend to echo KnC's claims.
Given how well Bitmain and SP have managed to squeeze the efficiency down on their chips at 28nm, I wouldn't put it past BitFury to get even better efficiency at 16, given how long their 55nm originals remained competitive.
Not being able to buy their equipment has been the status quo for a while now, and is largely the route of all the remaining manufacturers (unless you can spring the money and power requirements for the SP50 anyway) except for Bitmain and potentially 21, Inc. (if a dev kit catches your fancy).
So Bitfury would be taking over (at least in terms of theoretically being able to maximize profits) but it would largely be taking over from other fairly closed-off outfits anyway.
As it is, until they start populating their 100Ph/s mine, they're a bit behind the major Chinese pools (largely Bitmain hardware, though at places where electricity is nigh-on free you can still spot the odd Avalon, A1-based custom miners and I'd imagine a few ASICMiners are still happily hashing away until dying and landing on a de-assembly heap);

I guess you'd have to define 'substantive' first.  One of China's more interesting video series on the Bitcoin ecosystem - mostly interviews - comes from a young woman.
But it's clear that most people involved with Bitcoin in any way (developers, service providers, users, etc.) are men - and it's not entirely surprising that the book being discussed features zero women (supposedly, I haven't read it) in a non-primary role.
That's really not that much different from a lot of other 'niche' tech/nerd areas.  That's not something that's easily solved either.  If it were, there would be dozens of areas that could benefit from the solution much more than the Bitcoin ecosystem.

@_date: 2015-09-04 19:34:50
Looks great!  Here's some nitpicking:
1) One example that did stick out at me, example 18.  In it, the cited text uses the **B** (for lack of the proper symbol) as an example for what to look for at a cash register.   I don't know how this plays out, semantically, as being the *use* of the symbol in running text.  Substitute the symbol with, for example, the double circle logo of mastercard/maestro; is the symbol here really used as part of running text?  Perhaps put differently, in the example given, the use of the symbol directly could easily be substituted with "See figure X", with the referenced figure showing the symbol.  In most of the cases where I think of it being used as being 'in running text', such a substitution would not be possible without breaking the text.  This does also apply, to an extent, to the xe.com example I provided earlier :)
2) Another minor nag: bitcoinwiki is spelled two different ways (three if I count it being capitalized at the beginning of a sentence).  I've never given this much thought myself, referencing it as just the Bitcoin wiki.  On the site itself, it appears to be written "Bitcoin Wiki" in both the front page header and the site's footer.
3) Total aside: Namecoin's symbol (Page 8) actually doesn't render correctly in Chrome Windows' PDF reader - displaying instead a missing symbol placeholder (rectangle with X in it).
4) When citing examples via screenshots, are you allowed to modify them aesthetically to separate them from the textual content of the proposal?  If so, that might be good.  Perhaps all that would be needed is a leading vertical bar.
5) Page 5, "It is not restricted to English, but is used in numerous languages." - not sure a 'but' is correct there.
6) Page 5, "Drawing the glyph".  Should some of the variants mentioned, such as the version from the Bitcoin Wiki's Symbol page by Pander, be included here - perhaps along with another example - of how the symbol may fit in with other fonts?  The one referenced now seems to fit in with Helvetica-style fonts, the one on the Wiki page has more of a Times New Roman type feel, leaving (though one can never have too many fonts) a freehand style font, e.g. as a simple extension of Short Hand's 'B';   .  This also in reference to form question 4b.
7) Page 5, "( Although there are factions encouraging the use of alternative characters. )".  Should this just be removed / move to page 7, "Potential issues"?
8) Page 6, formatting: "Range: Currency Symbols", ensure entire paragraph is on page 7? ( The citations split the paragraph. )  This as a more general hint; after adding all content, review each page for paragraph / sentence splits and consider nudging lines to the next page if the visual flow is interrupted.
9) Page 8, "The Bitcoin sign".  Only now noticed - there's mixed references to "Bitcoin sign" and "Bitcoin symbol".
10) Page 8 / 9, the "Conclusion" seems to mention the occurrence in running text twice; "It occurs in running text." and "The Bitcoin sign is used extensively in running text in [...]".
11) Regarding question 5b: again, should we touch up the font before submission?  There's a few deficiencies in the vector that would be nice to fix.  Specifically:   
( I'm not a typographer, but willing to grab a font editor and at least take a stab at it. )

At the cost of several nickels / more dollars (and in the case of phone/tablet: battery life; the chip in this product is unsuitable for either of those devices)
I love the blockchain as much as the next person, but I'm not sure there's an advantage to its technology for the end-user compared to (part-)centralized payment systems.  Take Apple's approach with regard to subscription services, for example.  All an iPhone user has to do is okay the subscription costs and off they go.  There's no technical reason this can't similarly be done with a paywall with the user sending $n to Apple every so often, and when a site needs to know if a user is okayed to watch the page, ask Apple to pledge to send payment whenever the site decides to bill Apple.
Even if we take such (part-)centralized services out of the equation, it would be many times more convenient for a user to pre-load the tokens for use for such services and know exactly how things are going than that they want to read a site only to find that their mobile device has run out of those tokens and they'll have to wait for their device to regenerate those tokens over time.  Offering the option of 'topping up' as it were just brings things back to pre-loading.  This is not reducing friction.

Only if the content has a secret component.
In the case of audio, video, text, etc. there's no protection that is flawless.  Netflix's 4K stream encryption was cracked a while ago, for example, and they try pretty hard.  The biggest problem for all this type of content, however, is that in the end you may not need to crack it if you don't need a  bit-wise exact copy; the content has to be heard/seen by humans at some point, and that means it can always be captured - even if it  means pointing a camera at a screen or taking a photo of every ebook page and running the result through OCR.
You can watermark the content such that it can lead to the source of the leak - but the source of the leak may have willingly and wantingly distributed it, or had their own systems hacked.
Secret components are the only thing that can stem the tide of such actions - and software is one of the few systems in which that 'works'; be it that some processing is done on remote servers (so cracking the local client's code doesn't help much) and would require a lot of work to duplicate in a local environment, or that being online is a large part of the utility of the software in the first place (e.g. multiplayer gaming with no freely available server software).
There's probably more appropriate subreddits on the topic of copyright protection if you wanted to dig further - or just search :)
@_date: 2015-09-02 21:27:20

I'm pretty sure it was a sort of bullet list suggesting what a miner should accept, what it should do with it, what it should spit back out, etc.  I'm 99.9% sure one of the items mentioned was that it should be able to partition the underlying hardware so that a single miner could be rented by multiple parties; but adding search terms along the lines of 'rent' aren't helping any.

I think that revolves a bit around the line:


I.e. whether $ with a single line referred specifically to the dollar of Barbados, with two lines referred specifically to the dollar of Guyana and with a single line, but interrupted, to the dollar of The Bahamas (symbols as depicted on bank notes).
In most of these countries, use cases, etc. I would imagine that people don't really care too much which glyph is used, as they're all  'dollar' glyphs.
In the case presented here, there's very much a distinction between the Thai Baht, and the Bitcoin symbol; it's not a Thai Baht and Bitcoin Baht, or a Bitcoin and Thai Bitcoin.
There may be some argument with regard to consistency, since some people *have* started using the Thai Baht as a symbol for Bitcoin, along with Ƀ, even if it appears to be a minority.  However, I would posit that many of these cases are the direct result of the lack of a Bitcoin symbol in unicode and lack of awareness of how to insert the Bitcoin symbol in lieu thereof, rather than true adoption as a symbol for Bitcoin.
This is part of why I mentioned in another comment (other thread) that we should probably be doing more to make webmasters - or at least those who post things via whatever CMS of choice - aware of their options in including the Bitcoin symbol and, if they won't use it, accept feedback on the reasons why.  Maybe they really do think another symbol is simply better, or maybe they have technical reasons and that would be something that could be addressed.

Would it be safe to presume that the second point's concept could just as well be used for an "invalid if placed in a block whose total byte size is smaller than X" - or even a size range?
In terms of influence; presume a miner disagrees with whatever size condition is set in the transaction - they can just choose not to include that transaction and keep block sizes at whatever size they prefer.  So the incentive to include a transaction anyway is likely the fee - which in turn means that those with deep pockets have greater influence over block sizes than those without?
Additionally, this opens up attacks by those with the really deep pockets, as they could opt to include a fee high enough to make a miner accept their transaction requiring the block size to be below, say, 500 bytes and keep the majority of other transactions out of blocks.  
In the opposite situation (minimum block size), miners can game things themselves by including their own filler transactions.
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:14:54
I'm part of the demographic it's aimed at.  I'm interested.  I also, however, have absolutely no idea whatsoever what that Bitcoin mining chip is doing on there that would enable things that are actually a superior solution to a myriad of other options.
Somewhere else somebody mentioned an example of a Bitcoin mining chip in a weather station so that the weather station can not only feed the user its statistics, but also statistics from say a weather service, paying that service in tokens that somehow relate to Bitcoin (with the understanding that as devices ages (network difficulty goes up), the user may have to settle for less frequent updates from that service).
I'm not sure how that's superior to, say, having your weather station feed to that service (so the service gets your weather station's data) and in exchange you'd get N updates per t time from that service as well.  This wouldn't suffer from tokens' worth over time or how often those tokens would be replenished, etc.
It's also something that is already being done - e.g. flightradar24.  Have a box that can collect the ADS-B signals?  Throw flightradar24 its data and you get premium features in return.  No need for a blockchain, no need for Bitcoin.  It *could* be done with Bitcoin, a blockchain, and a mining chip.. but it wouldn't be a superior solution.

Regardless of how pointless it was, I hope you do condemn DDoS actions in general and in this case - as presented - specifically.
While I personally wouldn't mine against a BIP101 pool, I believe that Slush offering the option is a positive example of how this sort of thing could be distributed across individual pool members per their own desires, rather than switching a pool over in its entirety to any specific proposal.  
( I will note that using a port does make it easier to target than offering users the choice from a mining portal or even as part of existing hacky methods using username/password. )
Such an attack, especially given the apparent message, shouldn't be seen as an attack against BIP101, but as an attack against a pool that offers choice at all, and moreover an attack against those who wished to make use of that choice.

In what way does the Bitcoin mining chip start making sense at that point?  The service-interaction bits and pieces don't particularly need a mining chip, only tokens - be they a handful of satoshis or something else.  If satoshis: there's far more efficient ways of getting those.
I can use my imagination to see it work..I'm not seeing how it would be more efficient than other solutions.
Last I saw things play out "in coming years" for companies with "you just don't get it" type plans, it tended to involve bankruptcies.

Except that we don't even know if this device generates Bitcoin for the owner of the device.  Their FAQ is vague on this by merely saying it's not like a traditional pool; so it's their own pool? Can that be reconfigured to a pool of your own choice?  If not - you'd still have a centralized service.  Similarly, are you actually getting Bitcoin, or are 21, Inc. getting Bitcoin, and you're getting tokens for use in their marketplace/etc. instead?  That would prevent any issues with having these devices try to make dusty transactions but would also mean you're definitely not generating your own Bitcoin.
I'm sure there'll be answers scattered around twitter, their blog, tumblr-for-adults, etc. eventually.  Right now, the mining chip doesn't seem to make sense for much of anything, while their underlying ecosystem could be interesting.

I'm not - there's a parallel discussion about whether there should be a year display at all.  Right now I'm trying to make a better graph to (potentially) replace the one that was deleted; I suspect that one was plotting supply over time, rather than supply over block height.  However, explaining (a little bit) how supply over time can vary, within the same graph, would still be good.  Let me check your years and see if they agree with what I've got as the 'ideal' (based on 10 minute block intervals).
Edit: Had to adjust it to give fractional year output, but mine matches yours.  I wonder if the original author maybe included the first adjustment (to 25BTC) and then worked from there.  But yeah, in light of the above, doesn't matter so much - might get removed or at least modified quite a bit.

Right, and that's sensible enough - but then why go for a case?  I'm not sure a custom case holds additional value over existing RPi(2) cases.  Of course if you're actually going for a different board, then I get it :)
Regardless, I wish you good luck - it definitely would be nice if there were less expensive options than what is available now.

 - another site similar to bitaddress.org that you can download and check out offline.  
Go to the Generator section, then the Private Key tab.  Enter the private key, and check if the resulting address matches the one on your paper wallet.
There are other sites/utilities (Casascius' address utility, for example) that perform much the same thing.

As an aside: if clicking a node could keep the info in the text box so it can then be easily copied/searched, that's be great :)  Right now I pan the node over near that box so I can move the cursor there without accidentally hovering over another node and clearing the box's contents :)

I'm the kind of person this thing is targeted to, and the mining component just doesn't make sense to me.  Your comment, in part, illustrates why.
The argument is that you need a mining component in order to easily get a very small amount of Bitcoin because: A. you can't just buy a few satoshi, B. you can't just buy bitcoin at all wherever you are, C. they're trying to avoid KYC/AML and regulations in other countries (passing some regulations burden on to the end consumer instead), etc. etc.
Which is grand.  So why not mine with the underlying rpi2?  
If the argument against that is that it would be much too slow, yield way too few satoshi, etc. then congratulations: you've described pretty much every ASIC up to late 2014 as well.  One would have to make the argument that 21's chips have a longer term life to them.  
Even if they do (network hash rate tops out / difficulty tops out because things somehow hit a technological wall), anyone who would get started with this kit in November would have to come to the realization that 8 months later a minuscule amount of bitcoin it generates becomes (a minuscule amount)/2.
If the idea is that this is fine and they only need to give their plans along with people who go along with it a bit of a jumpstart the first few years and after that it doesn't matter anymore as their network has enough people with a handful of satoshi to start interacting, new players' instances can receive them from said enough people, and the miner aspect becomes effectively moot other than for building transaction blocks with their network not being too worried about whether it takes 10 minutes, an hour or a day, well alright.
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:16:42
Well obviously the drone would communicate with the remote control unit which houses the actual ASIC.  Also keeps the pilot's hands nice and warm.
@_date: 2015-09-22 00:36:52
That hinges a bit on exactly how things go from mining to the end consumer getting tokens/satoshis.
If it's a P2Pool type setup where there's (more or less) a direct payout of the block reward to a bunch of addresses, then they're not sending money (well, sort of).  If it's closer to a regular pool with payouts (I know their FAQ says it's not like regular pools but doesn't detail), then they are sending them money (depending on which government agency you're talking to anyway), just not acting as an exchange.  I have no idea what FinCEN's view of pools (and P2Pool nodes) is :)
As for more efficient: simply a transaction will do (but does bring things back around to effectively becoming an exchange).  The inefficiency I was referring to is with regard to the hardware (from production to transportation to maintenance) and consumption (8W minimum,  more than a Roku) just to get those few satoshis.

@_date: 2015-09-13 22:25:34
Not checking the math - but basically: yes, the first 8 characters are in and of itself sufficient for unique results most of the time.  
I do say most of the time because e.g. "1Bitcoin" will yield many addresses - vanity and 'burn' alike - so if a service only returns 1 in that case, it's either working on the principle of FirstBits (first matching address found in the block chain), or it is fundamentally flawed :)
goochain.net will return multiple results
So you certainly shouldn't *rely* on this by telling people they should just send payment to the address that pops up when they enter "1xxxxxxx".

@_date: 2015-09-21 21:05:04
Transfer of ownership for digital goods can be interpreted in two ways - a record of who holds the license for that particular digital good, or DRM.
The record bit you could do, e.g. have a specific unique version of that file, hash it, use that as a tag on the block chain, 'transfer' it to another person by way of some transaction involving that person's own identifier (an address, say).  Such services already exist, so this wouldn't really add anything new other than maybe (maybe) making it easier to administrate out of your own office.
DRM, on the other hand, would require software running on the client device(s) and a whole mess of other things which, in the end, get defeated by the analog hole anyway no matter how technologically amazing its interaction with the blockchain may be.

I'm pretty sure he has - there's a reference in the proposal to  which argues some similar points.
I won't go into that Melissa Volkmann post too much, but I will point out that 1. going out of one's way to make handwriting the **B** symbol more difficult than it need be (two of the tips can be combined with the ascender just fine), makes that argument look rather weak, and 2. the argument in favor of a Bitcoin symbol in the Unicode tables would nullify the vast majority of her arguments against the use of the symbol (and in favor of Ƀ) *now*.  'We' can either complain that adoption is too hard, too slow, etc. and settle for something that's 'meh, okay', or we can bite the bullet, make serious attempts at having it included in the Unicode tables, and provide help in including the symbol in publications in the interim.
@_date: 2015-09-01 01:25:25
That is in the 'emoji' section though.  There's articles on the web about the cluster... that led to its inclusion in unicode and, more importantly, its expansion to the ridiculous since then.  Suffice to say that the vast majority of genericized clip art with a host of modifiers (similar to how skin color ended up being dealt with) will eventually be a part of the unicode tables in that section.

tl;dr: 
1. Pools.  Concentrated hash rates lead to nn% attack viability in both single entity as well as collusion form.  
2. ASIC hardware manufacturers.  Fewer in general, and fewer that will sell to the public.  
3. Nodes.  Diminishing counts of full nodes.
Not mentioned, but 2 and 1 go hand-in-hand, and 3 is in part a result of 1 and 2 as well.
@_date: 2015-09-21 22:41:21


Here's the thing, though.. why wouldn't you run out?  
Let's say the device generates 100 tokens per day.  Here I am, and for all the services I'm making it interact with, I need 150 tokens per day.  
Do I run it for 3 days, and only use it on the last two days?
I do see the value in turnkey solutions - that's why I think hardware node efforts are a good thing even if (at least right now) all of the options are much more expensive than just rolling your own; as that takes time and effort in research and fidgeting with the hardware - and I can see their software end having a lot going for it.
The mining chip, though... I'm just not seeing it - especially with the all-but-admittance that you'd be better off not actually using it...except that maybe you must if you want to partake in their ecosystem at all.
Yeah, we'll see what happens.  I think I put in another comment that we probably haven't quite seen the proper sales pitch for their idea yet.

Not entirely sure what you're trying to say with that.
My concern for web developers / authors / etc. is mostly for the period in which the Bitcoin symbol is not available via Unicode and supported fonts; be that something that takes months, years, or may not ever happen.  Having the symbol available via Unicode simply makes this an easier effort, especially across other platforms, applications, languages, etc.
@_date: 2015-09-05 11:08:46
That's basically a result of the font/symbol as it is available in BTC.ttf.  You can see the same effect in many of the citations.  I didn't point it out in one of my comments regarding that font, but that should also be on a list of things to fix.  Font designers should definitely integrate it with the same weight as other glyphs in the set.
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:41:07

Putting sarcastic replies aside, I'm curious about the question you're actually trying to ask.
Let's assume that it's a bug that basically affects all clients.  That could mean an issue in the protocol, an issue in an algorithm, etc.  Most of these will be addressed in Bitcoin Core, and the issue and fix will be discussed on the [development list]( in [the code repository]( on [IRC]( on the [BitcoinTalk Forum]( and you'd be very likely to read about it on this subreddit as well.
There you go, the bug is fixed.
Now here comes one of the problems - what if the bug is something that, once fixed, will affect the blockchain?  In that case, more than half the mining network will have to agree to that fix.  Depending on the exact issue there are further steps of mitigation that can be implemented, but this is it in a nutshell.
And now for the question you might actually be asking: what happens to any transactions that occur while the bug exists and is being exploited?  Depending on the exact resolution of the bug, those transactions may be considered as never having happened.
Now, whether that is a problem or not... is a completely different question.
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:15:55
It's in pools' best interest to attack each other (to an extent).  Doesn't  make it *appropriate*, though. ( And in this case, it's entirely questionable whether or not this is being done by a different pool. )
@_date: 2015-04-25 20:44:24
1. 2. Low hash rate miners are best used as lottery devices in a solo pool (or just mining solo locally, but that means keeping your own copy of the block chain).  Note that 'occasionally' becomes a matter of 'on average you may win once in ever umpteenthousand years'; thus lottery.  
3. Search for 'paper wallet' (doesn't literally have to be paper) or 'cold storage' - that's still the best, imho, way to store the required information for larger amounts that you would access infrequently.  If it's coins you want to keep liquid, coinbase and other online services work okay, just don't complain if some security issue (at their end *or* your end) causes the coins to go poof.

Maybe - maybe not.  I actually feel like the 'serifs' to the left of the ascender are as much part of the symbol as the "lines not visible in the middle" part.  It's not that much more effort to make it so; I've been putting it in writing as follows for some time now: 
Yes, it's more effort than writing a B and then just running a vertical line through that - but as mentioned in the proposal, that would be the Thai Baht.  At the same time, it's really not that much more effort once you're used to it.  When the € sign was first introduced, getting the hang of writing that out properly took a little while as well.  And that's just for those of us who are used to the Latin alphabet; there's lots of others that have far more intricate glyphs.
I do agree that font designers may well have a different take on it and run the vertical line(s) through for the font they're working on, and that's probably fine as long as it remains reasonably distinct :)
@_date: 2015-09-08 12:08:02
What the what am I reading?


Except it doesn't look like the Thai Baht - that's kind of the point.


Where is that discussion?  I don't remember seeing any.  Though if they wanted to start one: if you don't know which one to pick, go with the flat version; it's the design mantra du jour to make things as flat as possible.  But the more intricate version has its place, as do whatever variant people come up with.  The **B** in a yellow/gold circle is not a trademarked logo, so do whatever - including just tilting it backward instead of forward as the author seems to have done.  It does, however, make it recognizable as that's what people are used to.  So an alternative symbol in a blue square?  Go for it - just don't expect people to immediately recognize it.


It's a symbol, used in a logo.


Which the first thing linked to is seeking to change via the Unicode proposal.




LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B WITH STROKE    
Why would community members be trying to get it into Unicode if it's already in Unicode?
The remainder of the article is a bit chaotic but echoes the "do whatever".  "Do whatever" doesn't preclude seeking inclusion of the symbol in the Unicode standard or using common sense when making graphics, though :)

At the low end of the chip's specs: 50Gh/s * 0.16W/Gh/s = 8W.  8W / 5V = 1.6A, well outside of USB specs.  You'd require a powered hub or have it split across two (USB 3) ports.
It's also not really a stick-friendly chip.  As much as I'd love to see it happen... highly unlikely :)
@_date: 2015-04-04 20:38:28
Looks like that would mean there's probably errors much further up in that table.
I certainly don't know about this particular area of the satoshi client, so perhaps somebody can enlighten what happens when the block halving reaches round 11+?  I.e. right now the reward is 25BTC or 2,500,000,000 satoshi.
At round 11, the reward would be 4882812.5 satoshi.  What happens to the actual reward here?  trunc/foor/ceil/some manner of rounding?  Some sources suggest that it would get truncated (floor) - but some confirmation on the behavior would be appreciated.  I can then update the table as appropriate.

1.1 The way Bitcoin's proof of work puzzle is set up, it's intended to take - on average - 10 minutes to solve it.  
1.2 Many sites choose to wait for several such puzzles to be solved before the puzzle that contained your transaction is counted as valid.
2.1 There are no current plans to modify the time it takes to solve the puzzle.  
2.2 Merchants may opt to require fewer puzzles to be solved, or even to only react to your transaction being broadcast after a few minor checks to gain confidence that it will be included in a valid puzzle solve.  This incurs a risk for the merchant, however, as that confidence cannot be 100%

You may want to read the FAQ, hit Google, etc.  Just to answer your specific questions very briefly:  
1. You can only 'make' Bitcoins by mining.  You can *earn* Bitcoins doing whatever - as long as you can find somebody willing to pay you in Bitcoin for your trouble.  
2. You could get paid Bitcoins for commissions in art by anybody who has Bitcoins to spend - doesn't have to be a miner.  
3. Possibly, but you'd be more likely to just find general people looking for X and willing to pay in Bitcoin to get said X in general request sections at e.g. BitcoinTalk.  
4. There is no 'really cheap way' because if there were, everybody would be doing it.  25 BTC is not 'cheap'.  
5. There's tons of sites that will tell you the current value of 1 Bitcoin, multiply by 25 to get your answer; try bitcoinaverage.com
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:04:20
I wonder how, though.  Most people wanting to do digital goods and services business can just fire up a website and opt for whatever e-commerce package that comes with, some of which support Bitcoin.  Even if it doesn't support Bitcoin, you can get set up with that pretty quickly as it is - and if you don't want to part ways with fees, then there's guides on how to accept Bitcoin without an intermediary.
Add to that 21's own statements that you probably won't profit off of the Bitcoin mined with this device but that you'd profit off of the sales of the digital goods/services (in which case, why the mining if it's actually going to lead to a net loss by default).  
Top that off with not accepting Bitcoin payments themselves just yet (granted, not a digital product) and I think we have yet to hear the full sales pitch of why you'd want this, what you can do with it, and how it would benefit businesses over [insert alternative].

Technically speaking it's impossible to get *all* burn addresses, as there could be burn addresses that are actually randomly generated.  Thiereus' suggestion should at least help you trim down the possibilities - along with just running a dictionary against all known used addresses.  Do note that for some hits, you might hit vanity addresses, rather than true 'burn' addresses.
You can at least add the 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSend ones.  Handy transaction:  
@_date: 2015-09-01 01:27:52
I think that depends on context.
If you're showing transactions, then yes - you might as well show **B**amount instead of "BTC amount" or "amount BTC".
But if you're showing, say, an exchange rate and you've already settled on using 'USD' as one of the symbols, then you should instead use XBT (though personally I think BTC is fine, the financial world seems to largely have settled on XBT), rather than **B**.
@_date: 2015-09-21 21:23:05




I agree that there's many questions that go unanswered in this.  As it is, their FAQ that deals with this doesn't make sense;






The first part actually makes more sense, so let me get to the last part first: Most pools don't pay out 'randomly timed block reward(s)'.  Solo pools do, but those are the exception, not the norm.
The first part suggests that there's no payout frequency / threshold concept.  The same can be said of several PPS pools, though.  Moreover, it could be said of P2Pool nodes (though hash rate gets iffy there) and P2Pool hybrids.
At the same time, it does imply that you'd be mining against whatever they've got set up, rather than your own choice of pool, which - if not modifiable - does put you at their mercy.
It's a bit moot when you consider their answer to whether or not you'd profit off of the mining in the first place, though.  70% of zilch is still zilch.  If they took 70% of your loss (after electricity, say), that would be more entertaining ;)
@_date: 2015-09-05 22:39:52
Day-old post is day-old, but exactly how did this happen?
The interface is not all that ambiguous - i.e. the addresses you want to send to are one list, and the miner fee is an addressless completely separate form element, all of them labeled appropriately:  
Upon review, you further get asked if you're sure you want to send X amount to A addresses:  
  
( Note: the high fee warning kicks in at 1BTC, so it does exist - yours just wasn't high enough to warrant a warning; perhaps they should lower this. )
Furthermore, if you click on the advanced view, you get an even clearer overview of your transaction:  
For your sake, I hope BitFury helps you out.  But I also hope people reading your story understand that there's only so much technology can do to help.  E.g. if the level were lowered to 0.25BTC, you'd still have people sending 0.24BTC in the miners' fee and then complaining that *that* is allowed, even though they entered that themselves on a pretty comprehensible form and okayed it in the transaction confirmation dialog.

imho, GekkoScience's little miner at $25+shipping, is the best entry level device bought new at this time; but I readily admit I'm biased :)
Another option though would be to get pre-owned hardware.  I think the SP20 is starting to be a bit iffy, but Bitmain's Antminer S3 and now S5 (since introduction of S5+ and pending S7) can sometimes be acquired for not entirely absurd prices.

Yep - Avalon of today isn't the Avalon of yesteryear... or, well, of early 2013, and hasn't been for a very long time now.  Their international sales website is a bit of a mess, though - pricing for the items is incorrect, etc.  Best to inform directly if you'd happen to be interested in buying any.  Their Avalon 4.1 miner was actually fairly popular for a while there (after Spondoolies-Tech basically stopped producing).  They're supposed to have a new chip in the works as well, but I haven't heard anything on that in a while now.

Unrelated to Hashcash, Bitcoin, etc.  SHA-256 is just one variant of the SHA-2 hash function.  In this case, it's a change in the hashing method for their certificate - away from SHA1, which in terms of security has been fairly iffy for a while now.

It is - leave it running for a good while and you start seeing some fun patterns.  Miners paying out are pretty obvious, for example (single transaction node with a bunch of out nodes).  Payment networks showing clusters all connected together.  1mtgoxNrDZ... transacting with itself back and forth (in/out nodes surrounded by transaction nodes).  OP_RETURN clouds (bunch of single transaction nodes with no connections), etc.

Yeah, I consider that kind of parallel to BitcoinCharts.  All the others give a (weighted) index.  For BitcoinCharts, that machine grabs the average of each USD trade, and then averages all those together completely unweighted.  In fact, that tends to end up with a higher value than the (weighted) indices.  If I get bored later I'll see if that machine does log things and drop a graph somewhere.
Edit: Though I'll add XBX to the machine, at least :)

The last halving also occurred at a time when CPU/GPU mining was still a thing.  Miners these days have to take into account electricity prices when acquiring hardware.  5,000 machines chugging away making a wee bit of profit with a 25BTC reward will not be doing so with a 12.5BTC reward.  You can plan for that eventuality, or you can just build out while the reward is still 25BTC and then call it quits, selling the gear for chums and scrap.

* your customers *must* be new to Bitcoin, or they'd know this.. and not complain about sub-$1 differences on a $50 item.
* you don't price your items in Bitcoin, which causes this conversion mess to be required in the first place.
* you don't give a discount for use of Bitcoin that overcomes this exchange rate difference such that it benefits the customer, giving them no reason to complain complain.  Sure, you might complain about being 'under paid', but hopefully you pay less for Bitcoin transactions than you do for whatever other payment options you offer.  The difference in rates is well below 5%.

If you're asking if 4 words could be used as the input to a generator, then the answer is yes.  As can 1 word, or even 1 character.  A major problem is that when there's only 4 words, it gets a heck of a lot easier to brute force things than when there's 12.  Not that 12 is ideal by any stretch of the imagination.

Just have a look at miners from ~9 months ago.  Practically all of those targeted hashing power over efficiency, many with claims about overclock capabilities.
Note that it doesn't really make sense to run these even for a single user, though - even students in dorms/apartments probably don't want to live with the noise these produce if you want to keep them cool, and it's sure to raise eyebrows.
@_date: 2015-03-12 21:06:44
Not so much.  I just don't believe that their proposed intermediary trade-off between pooled mining (little variance, very small payouts) on one hand, and solo mining (huge variance - as in all or nothing, large payouts) on the other hand is one that would be picked up by miners.  Electricity costs is very much a very low variance factor.  Most of those mining at pools getting whatever pittance they're getting are offsetting that against electricity bills.  Playing a middle ground sort of lottery may work for some, but that same group could probably just as well try solo mining.  It also does very little to *combat* large scale miners - they will always have the upper hand without radical changes.  Let's say that a large scale miner actually had zero advantage from their hashing power because some mechanism makes it so that every single hashing machine stands an equal chance of winning.  That still means that the large scale miner has many more equal chances of winning than somebody with a single hashing machine.  Add to that the economies of scale in power, cooling, etc. and I see nothing in the proposal that would 'decentralize Bitcoin mining', and moreover I see more reason to think it would further centralize it.
As I said in another comment, though, it's still a novel solution and an excellent paper - and it's entirely possible I missed something in the finer details.
I think the biggest challenge would be getting these changes to be adopted in the first place, though, which might make it moot (for now) from a practical standpoint in terms of Bitcoin.  Altcoins, take note :)

Or take a look at multiple:  
BitcoinAverage:   
BitcoinCharts:   
BitPay:   
Coin Cadence:   
Coinbase:   
Coindesk BPI:   
They all tend to agree with each other quite closely.  I can make a chart of the past several months or so (depending on whether the machine that's been tracking them also logged them).
Edit: Done - ended up being just over a year of data that was recoverable.
They all tend to agree fairly closely with each other.  PYMNTS is really the odd one out.  Its data had to be specifically filtered to remove strange outliers and even a few negative values.  'Bitcoincharts*' is consistently high; it is a naive arithmetic mean of all USD sells (so not Bitcoincharts.com's own weighted index)
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:01:48
I honestly don't know.  Technologically, there isn't much of a down side.  It's a small bit of code that you'd change.  You'd still want to try and match it to the total supply, just get rid of the large relative changes.
Economically, I suspect that a smoother transition would be easier to game.  But I'm way out of my league on that.
There seem to be existing discussions on 'why' the halving was chosen - but I can't say I've read any answer that's specifically more likely to be the truth than that it was semi-arbitrarily chosen.
Looks like there's at least one altcoin (XSS) that does a gradual, non-linear, decline.  Of course, as with most altcoins, it appears to be dead in the water so there's nothing that can really be said about the impact of that reward reduction scheme.

centralization of mining pools is a problem insofar as cynical views go - i.e. the pool operator deciding what transactions get included in a block, the pool operator deciding whether or not to pay out at all, the pool operator deciding to skim a little more off the top than they claim, etc.
There are other constructs that can prevent some of these things.  The paper actually mentions a few of them.  One of their arguments against those, and e.g. P2Pool, is that they haven't attracted critical mass.  Which.... is kind of what their own proposal would be facing as well with the additional argument that it would require extensive changes, so that argument is a bit like throwing bricks in a glass house.
Their solution is more novel, though.  It's a perfectly good read - I just disagree with OP's title for the most part, and a good chunk of the premise in the paper that effectively lead to that choice of title.

Okay, just as an example : I'm looking at allUSD (I'm guessing that's some sort of (weighted) average of trades) with a bid/ask - similar to e.g. BitcoinCharts.  
BitcoinCharts also offers a single index:   
Further, they offer that as a publicly accessible API: 
On your site - and I'll readily admit I haven't poked around at it much yet - there doesn't appear to be a single index (which isn't terrible, the average between bid/ask or the most recent 'bought at' / 'sold at' works pretty well), the values that are there don't appear as text (all drawn on a canvas), and the data seems to be pulled in as a JSON object...but it's actually a BLOB.
Of course, if you're still pulling data from cotrUSD, I could have the machine just grab that directly :)
Nice charts, though!

PNG was 'totally unusable' for the masses until browser support took off, and even then PNG with nice alpha was not finding much adoption until webmasters got tired of waiting and used filters in IE to get the alpha going (until IE added support proper).
You have to start somewhere, and while it'll be good to wait and see what e.g. compression.ru's suite of tools make of the performance (encoding/decoding speed, size, etc.), what's there now is good enough to get people started with writing libraries, adding support to software, etc.

For the curious, changetip does offer an address you can send funds to that will then be stored in your changetip account.  I can't recommend this for larger amounts, but here you go:
When logged in, click on "View my money" on the left.  That should take you to  .  On that page, there's a field "Deposit Bitcoin directly to ChangeTip".  Next to that is a button labeled "WALLET".  Click on that and you should get an address complete with QR code.  Copy/paste that address to whatever service is requesting it for payments.
I'd recommend getting a different (offline) wallet instead, though.

That doesn't necessarily follow - it would only be broken if the hash could have been arbitrarily chosen or the solution brute forced.  If instead it were a natural anomaly, there's no breakage implied.
There's a decent stackexchange discussion about pretty much the same question, except it would have to be compounded (as a hash of the message must now match a hash of itself): 
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:36:02
Alternatively: This would kill mining pools and further concentrate Bitcoin mining at large scale operators.
Edit: In fact, having fully read through the paper now, that is exactly what would happen *unless* the proof of work algorithm were also changed.  This is only mentioned near the end of the paper in Addendum A/Integration Issues.
So while it would on one level decentralize because people, purportedly, wouldn't trust pools anymore - and pools wouldn't trust clients - each individual miner currently at a pool would very likely call it quits if they couldn't use pools to begin with; selling or scrapping their gear, both of which favor the large scale operators.

The difficulty is adjusted based on the time it took to 'mine' 2016 blocks.  If it takes less time than intended (2 weeks), the difficulty is increased.  If it takes more time than intended, the difficulty is decreased.  A decreased difficulty thus means that the overall network hashing power for the last 2016 blocks was lower than it was for the preceding 2016 blocks.

While I agree that the GPLv3 choice is dubious in terms of getting adoption, clean room implementations can always be made; at least there's no patent claims from the authors (odds are some existing patent portfolio body would raise a finger though).

So far so good, but then these next conclusions without citing why they would be the case:




Why not?


Following from the first one, supposedly, but that's still unanswered at this point.


I guess that's supposed to follow from the second point?  Because regulations don't mean anything if you can be anonymous or...whatever logic they're using?
Of course they then propose to effectively introduce more MtGox's.  Or, well, payment processors that internally, and perhaps with each other, make agreements on which account has what funds, making transfers instant - but completely publicly untransparent; you have to trust the off-chain ledgers, and thus trust them not to game those ledgers.
Additionally, what makes 1MB ideal?  Maybe, for their arguments' sake, 256kB would be even better, and they should aim to have the block size reduced?

The main difference between having a wallet-wallet and a bitcoin wallet is that one is on your person and easily verified, the other is not - unless the robber honestly believes that you memorized your private keys by heart.
Now, you also mention the Trezor - so assume the robber knows what a Trezor is, and forces you to access the device.  That's a better point - in which case I'd recommend that the Trezor people do what Truecrypt et al have done - plausible deniability.  Have N passwords, one that's the actual one, and one or more that just lead to bitcoin wallets with just pennies or whatever on there.  Of course multisig would still be better, but the above should be enough in any case of an on-the-spot robbery.  ( Note that this is also something that is recommended with fiat.. i.e. when traveling abroad, keep some cash in your wallet handy to give would-be robbers (and if you need to carry any other cash, keep that elsewhere) )

I'm glad the design is being revamped.
As I mentioned in an older comment regarding bitcointalk's looks, 'outdated' isn't really an issue and many of the modern semi-forums really, really cater to the smartphone/tablet people and then extend that to desktops; letstalkbitcoin's forum is an example of that:  
I wish I could say that only applied to things like design/layout, but it's true for usability as well.  After the first iPhone, right click and middle click went away.  Some devices might try something with tap-and-hold, but in general that gets ignored when designing for touch devices.  Which means that you end up with things like this: when you intend to right-click  (or middle-click for much the same behavior in most desktop browsers) on 'quote' to open a quote+reply to somebody in a new tab, you just get the thread again.  
Same with the markdown rules - open those in a new tab so you can have them ready while writing your reply?  Sorry, you'll just have to open the new tab, and then click on that link.  
Why?  Because those links aren't really *links* - they're just intended as tap-responsive bits for javascript invocation.
It's all good and well to have something that looks sleeker, more modern, that fits in with design for mobile devices ('flat' being the design du jour - I'm surprised you still have rounded corners, for that matter) - and yes, it's a lot easier to use on those devices than bitcointalk is - but in some cases the philosophy of working back from mobile devices it hurts functionality needlessly.
That said: a forum that doesn't go down and doesn't strip functionality for no good reason is better than one that does.  I don't know if letstalkbitcoin is the right alternative at this time (next to reddit/stackexchange), but at least it's an option.

Say you're flipping a theoretical coin once every 5 minutes or so, but you're only noting down the time when it's heads.  On average, you should be noting down the time every 10 minutes and get 6 recordings every hour.
But let's say that at some point you get 12 recordings in the hour.  Does that mean you just started flipping the coin every 2.5 minutes instead, or does it mean that you just happened upon a streak of the coin landing heads up?
In Bitcoin, the latter is a far more likely scenario.  That said, presume that streak continues for a long time - then it being a 'lucky' streak doesn't matter to Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment either.  It will still *interpret it as a hash rate increase*, and increase the difficulty as a result.

well, the "didn't read" part of TL/DR is quite obvious ;)  
This isn't about any issue with SHA256d or any proposal to switch from that.  It's about making specific hardware implementations of a miner more efficient overall, by way of a method that in some cases is actually less efficient.

There's no way to know how many 'entities' are in 'unknown', though.  Also note that some of the known ones may be spoofed.

Right - what I'm saying is that 1. you can't definitively tell from the block interval and 2. it actually doesn't matter too much as the algorithms can't either, and for all intents and purposes the network hash rate may be interpreted as having increased.  That said, as more blocks are added, confidence in that interpretation does go up.  Might be a deploy of new hardware.  I know BitFury is overdue, AM is supposed to be getting their new chip out the door but I don't know how rapidly they could actually deploy that.  Leaves a bunch of darks with their own tech, and farms that could just be hooking up existing tech.  Seems an odd time to do so, but what the hey.

Seems a lot of people forget about the compressed vs non-compressed public keys :)
I don't know what further overlap you're thinking of, though.  So I might have forgotten something as well.  Could you elaborate?  I'm fairly certain that a private key maps to two addresses.
If you're thinking the other way around - i.e. how many private keys map to a certain address - then I gotcha :)
Edit: I just realized that op basically asked both questions - so you probably did mean the latter :)

That might be a quick question, but there's no quick answer.  Have you searched this subreddit, related subreddits, financial services' outlooks, and done your own research?
My guess is 'no' or you wouldn't ask this question (regardless of which answer you'd find).  Getting a personal suggestion here is ill-advised for both parties, though.  Somebody tells you that it's an amazing time to buy in, things go south, that person feels bad / you will find them and you will kill them with your very particular set of skills.  Somebody tells you not to bother, the thing goes to the moon, and you kick something, but it turns out to be the corner of a table, and boy does that hurt.

Yeah, me too.  I've watched 50 movies so far (this year), and all but one were shit.  Okay, they weren't shit, but they weren't good.  
Okay, it's not that they weren't good, I mean I did watch them and all.  In fact, I was pretty entertained by World War Z, Despicable Me 2, Iron Man 3, Olympus Has Fallen, ST: Into Darkness, even Man of Steel - or I would have just skipped the movie some way in.  But what I meant was, they weren't great.  
Well, I mean, some of them were great.. but they weren't $10 great!  Maybe that's not entirely true either.. Now You See Me I would probably have paid $10 for.  But I've already seen it now.. why would I buy it?  
Oh right, because I'm doing the right thing and buying only if it delivers.  Well I'll wait for it to appear in the $3 bargain bin and buy it.  That still counts, right?
See, Hollywood?  If it weren't for piracy, I wouldn't have watched 50 movies and you wouldn't have had $3!  And since I mentioned all those movie titles, I'm spreading the word, giving you free advertising, and people are now far more likely to also buy those movies.  At $3 in the bargain bin.  Or not at all since they, too, download them and will already have seen them so why bother?
Wait... I think I may be doing this wrong.
( disclaimer: I'm neither against nor for piracy - I just find that the "try before you buy" tends to end up as "try before.. wait, why buy?" when actually encountered in practice. )

I'm not pro-regulation of Bitcoin, but then Bitcoin in and of itself cannot be regulated (though if they tried really, really hard, they could block transactions).  I wouldn't say I'm pro-government in general either, but there's certainly benefits to having one vs not having one (although individualism has its perks).
What's being regulated is the bit where people exchange a currency (say, U.S. Dollars) for Bitcoin, or a Bitcoin to a currency - and even then the issue isn't with that exchange itself, but lack of registering as a currency exchange.
If Bitcoin is really to flourish, it will eventually have to become a non-story that you couldn't exchange it for Dollars, Euros, Yen, or Gold nuggets, because you the person having the good or service you desire will accept Bitcoin, and they pay their suppliers in Bitcoin, who pay their staff with Bitcoin who buy Chicken nuggets with Bitcoin.  Regulating that activity is what would really need to be opposed.  While the exchange issue could be deemed a slippery slope, it's not the slope that would lead to actual Bitcoin regulation.
As for your final statement.. I don't see why a government would have to 'voluntarily enable' a competing currency at all.  For example, the U.S. government certainly isn't 'enabling' (or disabling) stores in the southern states accepting Mexican Peso, and the stores are welcome to not accept it at all.
Unless you're suggesting that the government declare Bitcoin legal tender, but that's about as likely as declaring the Peso legal tender.. actually, probably less likely.

Right now, attackers can purchase somewhat commodity hardware that does one thing: Find a string that, when hashed, results in a value Z below value Y.  That's a far, far stretch from finding a string that hashes to the exact value of Y.
The number of rounds might slow things down a bit for a dictionary/rainbow table attack, but nowhere near as much as the user changing their password from "password" to, say, "svt7mKD_hBGb-JsCPBOvixScqGfmhThS".

There's no *the* 'Bitcoin.exe' - there are many applications that can mine Bitcoin.  What exasperation is referring to is the fact that it's impossible to confirm that your 'Bitcoin.exe' is the result of 'Bitcoin.sourcecode' without compiling 'Bitcoin.sourcecode' yourself is not an issue limited to Bitcoin.  The thing is, unless you *are* willing to compile it yourself, or put trust in a certain chain (e.g. a group of people who *do* compile it themselves, and they all concur that the resulting executable should have a certain hash value (MD5 is still the standard there there) and you check the hash value of your 'Bitcoin.exe' against what they have published), you're just going to have to trust the wisdom of the masses to post an alarming message to reddit if there's something untoward going on :)

@_date: 2013-11-05 17:57:31

4. Print the result.  
5. There is no 5.  Unless you followed step 1.5 and are really, really, really paranoid, in which case.. torch that machine.. and your printer.

Not sure about best - since they sell for a premium - but the Casascius coins do look very nice.  A cheaper option is the credit card-sized Bitbills.
Of course, you can always use a paper wallet; paper being a bit of a misnomer, you can make it any design you want and print it on paper, engrave it in wood, chisel it out of a marble slab, or whatever you like.
( Note that these are almost inherently different from the above two in that paper wallets are generally fully available to the holder.. whereas the above products have safety seals that keep critical information secret even from the holder and the products themselves are considered 'worthless' once that seal has been breached and the secret is assumed to be no longer that. )

Your best bet is to hop onto localbitcoins.com , and browse the sellers.  Unfortunately I don't think there's a way to actually search for a seller that accepts cc, so you may be stuck clicking around a fair bit.  You can also try contacting one directly - but keep in mind that you may get no response, or just a "are you kidding me?" :)
( Note that if you find somebody who is actually *local* local, you may just as well do a cash transaction - the above is only if the seller is rather far away from you. )

Well, thankfully nobody is even seriously considering putting it into the protocol.  Would be an easily-defeated place to do so anyway.
There's plenty of people wishing grave bodily harm unto the people behind CV, though.  And there's mining pool operators who will happily 'punish' certain addresses (re-used ones) in order to thwart the proposed punishing of certain addresses (the redlisted ones).

Yep.  Keep in mind that a lot of the 'money' that is in Bitcoin right now appeared out of market factors to begin with.
I.e. if I paid $10 for a Bitcoin a long time ago, it's now at $1010 (it's not, but that's a different discussion), meaning I have a $1000 profit.. but then it 'crashes' down to $210 tomorrow, I don't suddenly have an $800 loss.  I still have a $200 profit.. IF I actually cash it out.
Those who are only just now buying in, on the other hand, should it crash.. I'm sure they'd be a bit miffed :)
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:29:26
Well, it's a bit of a trade-off.  If I have as a password 'provocativenesslargeheartednoncompetitiveenviablypraynewsweekly', then a dictionary attack is going to hit that a lot more quickly than it would if I used a 63-character password consisting of random letters.  But the above is a lot easier for me to remember than 'fmvsydypinmlrfbajktqgpfiwxvpezqzwepvkijqukcppilcyobtgrqeiislcse'.
Of course, if you use a password manager of any kind, that issue becomes moot, and you might as well go for something full-blown with case changes, digits and special characters.

Since imgur destroys album description formatting:  
Hidden in plain Sight - A Paper Wallet concept  
A concept for (Bitcoin) paper wallets - hiding the private key in plain sight using Visual Cryptography (to wikipedia you go!)
One criticism of paper wallets that I have read is that the private key is required to remain obscured to prevent a third party from pilfering the address.  This can be from a glance, or from an ill-advised posting of a photo or video that shows the private key to a (semi-)public website, etc.
One often-suggested solution is to use an encrypted paper wallet.  This way the user not only needs the paper wallet, but also a simple password.  Unfortunately, this means a password must be held separately - unless printed in fine print on the paper wallet - and the appropriate decryption method/utility documented.
These concept images explore another approach, using a combination of apparently noisy images to reveal a common structure (one form of Visual Cryptography), but which on their own are nigh-impossible to casually video or photograph with sufficient detail to reconstruct the combination.
In both concepts, the 'paper wallet' would be (partially) printed on a transparent sheet (overhead projector transparencies, for example), and folded to overlap the two noisy images.  Further details follow in each image.
Down sides:  
1. If the original address part is lost, all is lost, even if the private key part is intact.  
2. Significantly more effort to construct.  
3. Alignment needs to be fairly precise.  Depending on physical print size, half a millimeter off can be more than enough to not see the correct pattern; this is also easily the basis for the reason why casual video-/photography are unlikely to yield usable data.
Alignment examples:  
[Hidden in plain Sight - offsets](  
Demonstration of the constructive and destructive effects of (mis)alignment in VIsual Cryptography as applied to QR codes.
Physical examples:
[Hidden in plain Sight - physical examples](  
Photos of physical examples of the concepts presented in   
Note that while it works, it's far from ideal, and would require further experimentation if this were an avenue one wanted to explore.  
The following changes are what I would try first:  
1. Use a laser printer. While I used an inkjet (inkjet overhead sheets), a laserjet would create more solid noise. The ink is slightly transparent which makes there be far less contrast than desired.  
2. Print the base on (photo) paper. This obviates the need for further paper backing (and saves on overhead sheet use).  
3. Use a larger noise grain. While the fine noise is key to this concept, it was frustrating to align as is. A happy medium between ease of alignment and casual photo/video-resistance may be found.
Note that I created this after making a little hidden message for a friend and only later realized what this was formally called, and upon searching found a previously existing thread that unfortunately went nowhere fast:  
[It has a link to a better example and to a more in-depth explanation of the technique in a paper.
Edit: as a side-note: no, the private key and address do not match, this is by design for the example, lest people send Bitcoin to the address (why, people? why?) and then realize somebody else yoinks them out again.
Edit 2: Reddit also ate some formatting - darn markup - fixed.
Edit 3: Alignment examples added, photos of physical examples to follow.
Edit 4: Added physical test of the example images.

Well, again, if the blockchain shows the transactions and they're all confirmed, and they're not going to some addresses that they have control over either directly or indirectly (planted malware on your machine), etc. etc. ... then there's not really much of any way that it actually *can* be a scam.

Why not?  Why have people collectively decided that a first edition of a Superman comic has value well beyond the paper and ink, and even beyond its original value (even after accounting for inflation, etc.)?
It's not really a collective thing, to be honest.  I, for one, don't think a first edition superman comic is worth all that much.  However, somebody else does - and I can sell to somebody else, which in turn means that it at least has the potential for it to be worth whatever they're willing to pay for it, to me.  So while I'm not so much part of the decision, I'm still part of what helps attribute value to it.

For the dollar, it depends.  If you're just using it as a unit, then 1 = dollar, anything else = dollars.  If you're using it as an adjective, however, it's dollar again - e.g. "a 20 dollar shirt".

Private sellers sometimes allow it - but in general, no.  The reason is that it's too easy to commit fraud; you pay for the Bitcoin, Bitcoin is sent to you, then you reverse the charge on your card; seller is out their payment AND their Bitcoin (since there's no way for them to get it back).

Just to give a ridiculous analogy that at least doesn't involve cars.. actually, let me make that involve cars somehow.
Say you, Natasha, claim to have handed Boris a wad of cash in Russia.  Boris may agree, but I'm not going to take your word for it - neither is 123felix, or anybody else.  If we did, then everybody would start claiming payments left, right and center and suddenly there's umpteentrillion bitcoin floating around out of nowhere.  You can imagine why that's bad.
So instead, we skeptical people go and hit YouTube, and we watch a ton of crazy dashcam videos (told you there'd be a car) until we find the one video (okay, there might be 2, but the odds are unfathomably against that happening) that has a few seconds in which we can see you taking the cash from an ATM (and we'll just have to trust the ATM doesn't spit out counterfeit bills, for the sake of argument here), and then handing it to Boris.
Now, what's in it for us to watch all those videos, besides a few hours of shaking our heads or laughing way harder than we should have? (because let's face it, dashcam videos are quality entertainment)  If you say "Nothing." then I, for one, wouldn't be particularly inclined to do that, nor would very many other people.  But if you said "well, I'll pay you 850RUB", I might be more interested.
The thing is, though, that at this time you don't really have to pay me.  Just watching those videos and finding those few seconds means I get 79,550RUB (about $2.5kUSD) as a reward to spend as I see fit.. and more likely than not, I'll just spend that on fattening up my own wallet.
And therein lies the point I made earlier.. right now there's basically a reward included by default, 25BTC for every block (a block is a grouping of transactions - the wiki will explain that better).  So even if somebody doesn't include a fee, you've got a fair bit of an incentive to try to verify the block anyway.  However, that reward halve in a while, then halve again, etc. so at some point people won't really have an incentive to do this verifying unless they have fun doing so, being altruistic, etc. *or* you include the aforementioned fee.
Now let's say that reward is gone, and you don't want to pay me either.  Then unless you can find somebody who finds dashcam videos the best thing ever and will watch them all day long for their own entertainment or being altruistic, you can jump up and down and claim you paid Boris all you want, but everybody else is going to say "No, you haven't paid him until *we* say you did." and conversely "No, Boris, you do not actually have that money until *we* say you do."
So you including that fee is not just an incentive for others to watch all those videos, but also a way for you to make sure that your transaction is verified, and not stuck in Limbo.  The higher the fee, the more people that will be willing to throw their resources at it.
That's the ridiculous analogy, with plenty of flaws, but I hope you get the idea.  Again, though, the wiki does a fair job of explaining it, going into technical details, etc.
If you would rather watch videos (not dashcam ones, I promise), check out this recent coindesk article that lists a bunch of them:

This tends to vary by language, and you're basically too late with this question :)  
Languages that have no noun-genders (or none to speak of, e.g. Dutch which mostly dropped them and only has gender vs nongender has gone for the gendered version but nobody worries what gender that would be) already have it settled.  
Those that do have already adopted one (Germans appear to have gone with 'der Bitcoin', m.).  
Those that haven't yet you could probably just check what they use for their own currency as well as e.g. Dollar and Euro.  Of course if they don't agree on a single gender for all currencies, you might still be able to dictate that it is either masculine or feminine.. good luck with that ;)

They could - I'm just saying it would be unwise exactly for the reasons you already pointed out.
That's not to say they can't directly accept Bitcoin themselves - setting up an address to receive Bitcoin is easy enough.  But at some point they have to pay others, and they may not be accepting Bitcoin.
It would be different if they could do *all* of their finances in Bitcoin.  But as long as there are major creditors anywhere in their business dealings, fiat is what should drive the decision.

so the title and the body are two separate things, I guess...
1. Sure there might be, and if enough people feel they're on to something with their alternative chain / coin system, then eventually there will be people who think they've been 'cheated' out of that one.  I don't see the issue, though?
2. Sure there's some 'distrust' toward early adopters.  Basically there's two distinct sets.. those who are just jealous of pretty much all of them, and those who think 'Satoshi' is holding on to umpteenthousands of Bitcoin and will simply 'cash out' one day.  Still not seeing an issue here :)
3. define "the wrong set of hands"?

5. If there's an alternative chain/coin that becomes so popular that it reduces the value of Bitcoin.. well, yeah.  Not very likely to happen short of something rather dramatic, but there you go.

There's probably very few ways to be anonymous.  There's also probably guides on this - have you tried Google?
Off the top of my head...
You probably can't use most of the sites where you can buy bitcoin, as most of them at least require you to send them the money electronically (which means an account, which means you), and many even require you to send in ID (which means you).
Your best bet is probably something like localcoins - i.e. buying it, in person, from somebody near you who wants to sell.  Of course the anonymity in this case is based on them not recognizing you, you not being exposed by somebody who knows you, and depending on level of paranoia.. security cameras in the area.
Next up is having your coins mixed, but even that requires a certain level of trust in the mixing service being used.  After all, they can 'mix' all the want, but eventually they need to send it to an address and you need to be told what that address is.  At least it would make it more difficult to track your transactions.
Which brings us to the transactions themselves.  They can all be tracked, but since nobody knows that 'you the person' is behind the addresses, that's just fine.  But your IP address could be recorded and if enough transactions enter the network with your IP address, people could certainly put one and one together - well, assume the addresses are closely associated with the IP anyway - whether that defines 'you the person' is another matter.  All the same, make sure you send it through peers or an online wallet (but again, make sure this can't be tied to 'you the person').
Of course, never make a transaction for goods or services that need to be delivered to you, since that also means you give up your anonymity.
Which means that for those things you're better off going the localcoins route yourself, and sell the coins for e.g. dollars, then pay for the goods/services with that.
Similarly, don't post your address(es) anywhere.  Don't post them here (username may be revealing, reddit has IP logs, etc.) for people to send satoshis to.  Don't put it on your webpage (your registrar may not shield WHOIS and themselves know who you are anyway) for people to make donations.
In short.. being anonymous with Bitcoin is surprisingly hard depending on your paranoia level.  I've probably missed a few gotchas, too :)

It has become more profitable - however, that doesn't mean that it has become profitable.  You're still not going to see positive ROI with CPU, GPU, entry level or even mid-level ASIC miners.  
If you've got the money to spare, one of the upper level ASIC miners will be profitable - but that still assumes that you'll actually have it delivered rather soon.  
Mess around with sites like  , plug in some numbers, then play with the month in which you'd start mining, and you'll quickly see any positive numbers dwindling.  
Those who took the chance a few months ago to get a miner even knowing that it wouldn't be profitable at that time but hoping the rate would go up, are laughing all the way to the piggybank now - but that's the gamble they took :)

Okay. $12,000.  Free shipping.  I have no idea where you're from, so let's just say that your electricity is free - I know it isn't, but let's roll with that anyway.  You also already have the cables to hook it up, you decide not to join a pool (because with 500 Ghash/s, why would you) so we won't worry about pool fees.. and hit the calculations.  
  
In a year, you would still be $1550 in the red.  Congratulations?  
( Note also that the figure doesn't really improve much at that point, the curve is against you ever getting that investment back. )
Yes - the calculations at that site are a bit simplified (I'd say in favor of mining since 1. BTC vs USD is relatively high right now, 2. It's overly optimistic - linear - on the difficulty increase. and 3. It assumes delivery in October pretty much means early October rather than late October.)  However, I haven't seen anybody claim that they actually do come out ahead... unless they ordered their miner very early on for very cheap.

In terms of hardware companies, I guess you'd have to ask whether their investment (in getting the hardware put together) is greater than what they rake in through pre-orders, 'IPO's, and sales to people who believe they _can_ come ahead.  I suspect the answer there is "what's that? I can't hear you over the sound of the $100 bills I'm swimming in."  
( Then there's the conspiracy theories about these companies using the hardware to mine with, themselves, while it's reasonably profitable to do so - then start shipping the things to customers once it's still a wee bit profitable, or sometimes not even that.  It certainly makes business sense, unless you make the hardware but don't believe in the value of Bitcoin and would rather take the dollars/euros/yuan/rubles..  well, rubles...)
Now, they're not all labcoin type stories.. obviously BFL *is* finally delivering some hardware, and people who ordered the hardware way back when may even have gotten a positive ROI (though many have determined that they will not and are requesting refunds through cc processors/paypal - if they were smart enough to use those rather than paying via a Bitcoin transfer as you correctly contemplated).  That was at least true a few weeks ago, I have no idea how true that is right now.  At least if you ordered right now (the above site claims delivery is 2 months later) you're sol.
Note that it's pretty much anybody's guess as to what happens when all this hashing power does end up bottoming out.  It could be that a significant portion of the miners drop off, which would decrease difficulty, and thus make it profitable to run these machines again.  Or maybe they'll hit up Namecoin instead (they should be doing merged mining anyway, right? right.), or it's found that pooled mining - while delivering generally lower payouts - is still a net positive for a short while (since 'generally lower payouts' is still better than the thing chugging away and not hitting a block for months if you're unlucky - of course you could also get lucky and find a bunch in a day and then you'd curse being in the pool), or try to sell 'shares' of their mining rig to other people, making sure they come out ahead from these sales.  That's what I would do, if I had a scammy bone in my body.  Somehow, some way, an equilibrium will be found that leaves mining profitable enough for some that the bigger picture of mining will essentially be that mining still happens, probably through a few big players - e.g. the large mining pools and maybe the odd rich person with free electricity who would be happy to expedite your transaction if you included a handsome fee.
As far as significant headway goes - whoa nelly... just because a single miner is probably not a good thing to buy into right now in terms of profitability doesn't mean they're not making headway, simply because there's so many of them; okay, 'so few of them' - but they bring a lot of total hashing power to the table. That network hashing power graph isn't going through the roof (well, it was until they made the vertical axis autoscale anyway) because there's no headway being made from these machines :)  Ironically, they themselves are a large chunk of the reason they're probably not going to turn a profit off mining alone.
For what it's worth, I mined briefly with a GPU and then an FPGA, never got in on ASICs - those who did early on probably turned a pretty profit, and it's tempting to chase them even when facing the facts.  
I think I'd sooner re-task the FPGA to do some vanity address generation, though (also not much of a profit, or use)... or maybe blink some LEDs.  Oohhh shiny.

bad link?
@_date: 2013-06-29 10:28:02
It's too early for walls of text, man :)  But I read it anyway, and am sure I'm misinterpreting.
Issue 1: What you're asking the unofficial carriers to do is, technically, illegal.  While everybody asks a friend once in a while to pick something up for them, you're trying to build a business around it and especially not report on the income from it.  Whether that should be illegal or not (I think 'not' on the former) is another discussion.
Issue 2: The buyer just paid 15BTC for a 10BTC item.  That's one heck of a mark-up.  I'm guessing these are just numbers you're playing with, but I would sure hope they'd be a bit more realistic.  Note that this is just the actual amounts paid - the 1BTC as an incentive to release funds is fine (could be higher, percentage of item cost, whatever).
Issue 3.1: You'd have to assume all packages are anonymous - like ordering from a 'novelty body massager' webstore and getting a vanilla box sent by 'AGME', otherwise the courier would still have info they shouldn't have.  
Issue 3.2: Even if they don't know about the package, they still have to pick it up somewhere, and deliver it somewhere.  The storage facility would be an essential part of such a plan to anonymize (as best as possible) to origin.  
Issue 3.3: And, similarly, you'd really need storage facilities as the destination as well, otherwise the courier would be aware of the destination address as well.  If this is a rural residence, it's probably a safe bet that this is the buyer.
Issue 4: You're assuming people are honest.  That's okay, I like making that assumption as well.  But if the buyer is not satisfied...  
Issue 4.1: what actually happens to the item?  
Issue 4.2: How does everybody get to be out of their Bitcoin?  I'm assuming it would be left in escrow, but would the keys just get destroyed, or does the escrow service pocket it, or does it get sent to a good cause, or?  
Issue 4.3: Assume the seller does send a brick, the buyer is obviously unhappy, but now the buyer is still out 16BTC?  
Issue 4.4: Why are the carriers, or anything along the chain excluding endpoints, out the BTC at all?  Assuming the carrier didn't damage the item or pocket it or whatever, and the buyer is just unhappy, how is that the carrier's fault?  Yet the carriers are still out 13/12/10BTC?
Issue 5: I'm assuming there's only a Carrier C because there's 3 carriers involved somehow and there could be fewer/more.  Assume there's 20 Carriers required - again, you're probably just playing with the numbers, but how would the spreading of carrier payment work in that case? ( Carrier A in the current case already gets 2BTC whereas Carriers B and C get 1BTC.  Not clear why. )
Perhaps it could be simplified when assuming that storage facilities are a necessity in the first place.  This would take care of actual origin/destination being revealed physically (buyer/seller diligence being key - FedEx'ing a package to the storage facility obviously means at least FedEx has a piece of information again. )
Similarly, no actual origin or destination information need be on the package.  It can be a plain brown box with only 5 pieces of information:  1. Origin facility.  2. Destination facility.  3.  Encoded message only the Buyer has a key to (so the destination facility can authenticate that the person picking it up there is the intended recipient), 4. Encoded message only the Seller has a key to (in case of returns). 5. A barcode and human-readable ID identifying the specific package for tracking purposes.
Once you have the fixed storage facilities, pickup/delivery also becomes a lot easier for anybody willing to participate (versus random people trying to get to 123 Oddball St. using their iThing navigation. )  
In addition, those facilities could act as the escrow as well.  They're already the escrow for the physical goods - might as well let them be escrow for the Bitcoin, ensuring that all parties they directly deal with get paid.  Note that in case of a multiple carrier chain between facilities, those carriers would have to square things away between themselves.
The facility could additionally act as an arbitrator in terms of the unhappy Buyer.  They don't need to have any technical knowledge of the Item, a release form can inform the Buyer that they are accepting the package 'as is', and have the right to inspect the content before signing.  If they don't accept the package (unhappy buyer), the package is simply returned to the Seller and the Seller would be out S&amp;H, otherwise funds are released and the package is handed over.  If the Buyer gets unhappy later on (buyer's remorse, say, or an issue they didn't identify during optional inspection), they'll have to arbitrate with the Seller on traditional terms.

The only correct answer here is: ask your lawyer.
The reason for that is that the US is big and laws differ based on where you are, and without knowing the exact law and all its implications, it can go either from saying that you have no idea what people do with it so it's not on you, through to you obviously thinking that they may which actually might put the onus on you (e.g. liquor stores not being allowed to sell to adults if they have a suspicion that they're buying for a minor - which doesn't just apply to liquor; see: Massachusetts and tobacco).

Pretty much.  The only counter argument that I readily see at this time is mining pools.  Though one has to wonder how much of that is younger people mining with their graphics cards (pre-existing expense or can be otherwise rationalized; "Need it for Half Life 3!") or the odd block erupter with a third party (aka parents) footing the electricity bill.  While the individual only stands to gain very tiny fractions of a Bitcoin, the increased worth does mean that's not *entirely* without merit - and all those individuals in the pool do add up to at least form a buffer against corporate megamining facilities.

Bitcoin is valuable because people see value in it.
The point in solving the hashes is 1. to get Bitcoin (reward/fee) 2. to verify transactions so that when you claim to have sent money from A to B, you can verify this.  That should really be the other way around, but right now most mining occurs because people want the rewards foremost.
The point of the whole system is something different for everybody.  Some say it's to subvert governments, others say it's an anonymous (if taking great care) payment system.  Personally I see it as just an alternative payment option (alongside say, PayPal or Google Checkout or whatever) without the central control and without the relatively high fees; fees can even be zero, but getting transactions verified can take longer because not everybody is willing to verify a transaction when it basically costs them money (electricity).
Benefit, see above.. little different for everybody.
You really should just start here, though:

You could try using a traceroute.
If you're on windows:  
* open a command line (Windows key+R)
* enter 'cmd'
* press enter key or click OK button
* in the new window that appears, enter 'tracert bitcointrezor.com'
* press enter key
That should give you the IP address and all 'hops' between you and the trezor website, and give a clue as to where it ends up being broken. ( If you paste this information, don't include the first 2-3 'hops' as they may identify / narrow down your information).
On linux / OS X the procedure is much the same, using [traceroute](
Or, through a chrome extension: [Network and Internet tools](

Personally, I would say 'yes'.  An offline wallet, or at least a wallet over which you have sole and total control means, if nothing else, that if it gets hacked you only have yourself to blame.. and not poor security at the online host, a fancy MITM attack, or anything else.
Use online wallets as a convenience, not as a secure storage facility.
Again, search this subreddit for paper wallets.. even if you don't go with actual dead tree, there's plenty of suggestions for disconnected or just simply hardened digital storage.

Maybe I'm blind, but who are these 'we' you're referring to?
Certainly in this subreddit I've rarely seen any post relating to where one might buy drugs (hard, prescription, or OTC) with bitcoin. bitcointalk doesn't exactly seem rife with posts about it either (and if it were, the complaint should be lodged there).  Sure, there's bound to be 'community' sites catering to the shadier side of things, but those are as much part of 'the community' as MLP rule 34 type forums are part of the MLP community.  They exist, they're out there, but unless you go looking for them, you're not all that likely to ever have to be bothered by them.
If anything, all the "let's get X to accept Bitcoin!" seem a lot more damaging, since it sounds horribly desperate, and almost never actually leads to the desired effect.

If a shop knows what's good for them, they would price their products in whatever the local currency is, exactly to prevent issues due to volatility and refunds, but still accept Bitcoin.  Whether they then cash that Bitcoin out or not is up to them (though if a customer does come back for a refund, they'll have to assure themselves that they have the liquidity to do so, which can also be affected due to the volatility).
That's why you'll see most businesses accepting Bitcoin doing so via a third party service that basically just sends them good ol' fiat money.  That way they get the benefit of "we accept bitcoin!" (as you pointed out), and none of the downsides.  They can always turn around and buy their own Bitcoin if they felt like it'd be a good investment.

One thing most will probably have noticed is that when the question came regarding separating the wheat from the chaff, none of the panel members mentioned CV or even a CV-like scheme.
BitPay came closest simply by mentioning that they, themselves, don't want bad actors to use their business, which was shortly after addressed as applying only to BitPay, and not necessarily to the larger picture.  BitPay is of course not subject either way as they are 'merely' a facilitator.

As for that article itself... ugh.  Summary:  
Page 1.5: I'm pretty clueless about Bitcoin.. and Open Source.. and how websites work, really.  It's not my fault, my boss shoved this task onto me.  
Page 1.5-2.5: Silk Road, Silk Road, Silk Road, Silk Road.. did I mention Silk Road?  Because that's the only real reason to use Bitcoin.  
Page 2.5 choice quote: "I used Coinbase because it had a YouTube video explaining how it worked that was pretty. Coinbase is self-explanatory; you go to the website, give them all your bank information (that sounds ill advised, but my identity hasn’t been stolen yet, so I guess it’s safe to do)".  Somebody keep her away from the internet :(  
Page 2.5-3: Look at me, I'm living off of Bitcoin!  Okay, not really, I'm letting other people make me live off of regular ol' USD by having them buy what I need using USD, and I pay them in BTC, and for my basic needs - like breakfast - I'll just reach for my pre-BTC life - by eating leftover Tostitos.  That's "living on BTC", right?
Conclusion: I hate Bitcoin because I don't (want to) understand it and its limitations and hey, boss?  Don't ever assign a crap assignment like that to me again - "Journalism is very glorious" indeed.  Can I go back to political fluff pieces now?

No.  Ideally* only the Sender sees what's in the package (because, well, they have to package it), and upon delivery to the recipient (at the facility holding the item), the Recipient can see what's in the package (presumably in a little privacy booth if they so choose, etc.).  
The couriers, facility staff, etc. don't get to see what's in it.  They, technically, don't even get to see 'who' the Sender and Recipient are.  They only know that the Recipient is the intended recipient because the Recipient has key to match the message on the package.  
Similarly, if the Recipient decides not to accept the package and it is returned, the Sender can inspect the package in the same way to make sure the Recipient didn't slip a brick into it and stuffed the actual Item into their jacket at the other facility.  
'* The only reason there's an asterisk up there is because if somebody really wanted to see what's inside the package, nothing's going to stop them - unless you're sending it in a very good safe.  That'd be fun.  On the other hand, if somebody did open the package, tampering would (or at least, should) be pretty evident.

And ubiquitous.  Unfortunately, the very nature of such an anonymous mailing system may also be what would scare such places off.  E.g. Walmart, postal offices, etc. would not be likely to partake.  So it would have to be set up almost from scratch, initially by 'volunteers' (they could get a slice of the BTC, just as the couriers do) who have storage space available, are willing to risk the packages containing lord knows what, and have the BTC to put up.  I wonder if storage lockers would work.. they're not all that popular in the U.S. outside of the huge garage boxes, though?

@_date: 2013-11-22 08:32:24
Yes, it's still online.  There really are no online / offline / paper wallets, in terms of the traditional notion of a wallet, per se.  All Bitcoin 'exists' in a ledger which basically says 'this address has this amount of Bitcoin'.  There's generally one agreed-upon valid ledger, and while in theory that could exist offline, I'm sure you can imagine the logistical nightmare that would be - so it's online ;)
The relevant bit you're really dealing with is the key that allows you to transfer funds *from* that address (which you also need to keep a reference to, of course) to another address.
In the case of an online wallet, that basically means somebody else holds the key for you.  
In the case of an 'offline' wallet, that means you keep the key yourself.  
Under that there's separately 'cold storage' - the other form being essentially unnamed but let's say 'hot storage', in which case you keep the key on your regular day-to-day internet-connected device(s).  Cold storage, on the other hand, means you keep it *off* connected devices.  That can be a USB stick, or a phone you really never connect to the internet, etc.  A separate group from that is one where you can read the key yourself* - the paper wallet.  While typically this will literally be a piece of paper, you could scribe it onto a platinum plaque or chisel it out of granite if you'd prefer.  ( * Though some 'paper wallets' only have QR codes printed - and QR encoding is certainly beyond my brain to decode on-the-fly. )
So now that we've arrived at the paper wallet, how does it 'store' it offline?  Well, again, it doesn't.  However, since only the person with the right key can usefully access the Bitcoin in a given address, if the only known copy of that key exists as a paper wallet, then holding paper wallet is equivalent to holding the unspent Bitcoin on that address.  If you were to burn that piece of paper (assuming it's literally paper), the Bitcoin in that address is effectively lost (odds of somebody figuring out the key, or stumbling into it, are astronomically low).  That's how a paper wallet makes it analogous, to an extent, to an offline currency.

That's pretty much what the 'PSA' (talk about dilution) should say.
Even if electricity is free, there's really no product that gives you profit any time soon right now;  
Let's assume you get free electricity...
Virtual Mining's Platinum Unit 6+6 looks attractive - start mining now and be net positive $120k next month, topping off at $370k a year from now?  I'll take that anytime (even if initial investment is way out of my reach).
Oh, but it's not really available yet, should be shipping in December.  So let's start mining in December.  Whoops, now you're out $27.8k next year with no end in sight.
In fact, while Virtual Mining looks good on paper for right now, that 'available in December' thing throws all of their products out the window.  The same applies to Hashfast (Dec), Cointerra (Jan), BFL Monarch (Feb), etc.
Oh well, let's make sure we start at a time when they claim they can deliver.. that just leaves two: KnCMiner Jupiter, where you get a net positive of $520 in a year, and Bitmine Desk 1000 where you get a net positive of $205 in a year.
Except that this is based on a 107% increase in difficulty each month.  This seems optimistic, as more ASICs are being delivered (profitable with respect to original purchase or not), so let's bump that slightly, just slightly, to 109%.  
Poof.  There goes the Bitmine Desk 1000's profitability.  Okay, in more than a year, you get a few dollars.  Eh.
The KnCMiner Jupiter fares a bit better - the difficulty would have to increase by 118% before it's no longer generating a profit any time soon (which is well inside the realm of possibility if you consider recent difficulty increases).  Of course, as soon as we stop living in a utopia and pay for the electricity, even at $0.05/KWh, the best you're going to get is $326 in May'14.  After which it should be shut down or you'll be paying more to keep it running than you stand to get back.
Yeah, the calculations are a fair bit simplified (and I sure do wish there were a decent spreadsheet to punch numbers into - maybe I'll make one - as I forgot to zap the pool fee), but overall they ring true - especially with regard to when you start mining.  A month doesn't seem like much, but it absolutely kills most options.  Given that most companies fail at delivering on time, I wouldn't take that risk.
Basically, if you're stupid-rich and don't mind throwing a few thousand dollars (or tens of thousands) at it, by all means, take the risk with one of the beefy offerings 'available' now, it's probably money you can stand to lose.  
If mining with dedicated hardware just seems like fun to you, pick up a Block Erupter USB.  They're cheap, availability isn't an issue, they mine a heck of a lot faster and more efficiently than a GPU, and at least you'll know for sure you're never going to get that money back so you can stop fretting about that and just enjoy mining for the heck of it.

The main concern it addresses is with (whether or not unwittingly) it getting captured rather easily on video / casual photos, etc. - that's not a concern that goes away entirely with a code that is hidden through e.g. a folded flap (which I do recommend) as that flap can fairly easily be unfolded; not limited to the recipient themselves, in a bout of enthusiasm at a christmas party for example ;)

All the more reason you shouldn't buy an address, and instead get them to transfer funds from the address to one you just created.

You can re-use addresses.  It's just generally advised against for end-users in order to help safeguard any level of anonymity they think they might have.
For a vendor, this doesn't matter.  In fact, you'd pretty much want to ensure that people know that the address given is your address.
Vanity addresses can help in that regard because it might visually appear as (for example) '1shwag9CiJmhfYhE7MzeSdmH82xRYrbYrt', thus identifying that as being 'your' address.
The concern OP has is that somebody else might generate '1shwag66f1795771cf2d84626dbbf1b49ab238c9', and some of your customers may be misled into thinking that that address belongs to you by virtue of it starting out with 'shwag'.
Basically, you'd either want the vanity address to be ridiculously hard to collide against (but then it's going to be hard to get a hit in the first place - as an example, the prefix '1shwag' has a 50% chance of getting hit on my machine in 2.6 hours.  Bad, but obviously I can generate several of those in a day.  If I did '1rea1shwag', it would take about 3300 years), or accept that collisions can occur and try to warn users against it.  Or, of course, don't use a vanity address :)

As Natanael_L points out, there's no reason there couldn't be any in the future.
It would be a rather complex design, with a chunk (or multiple chunks) of memory central to the processing cores to get data in and out as fast as possible, but doable.  Just not worth it right now.
Still, already it's favorable to use a GPU with its fast RAM, rather than a CPU with its relatively slow access to the RAM on your motherboard, for e.g. LTC mining.  Although the difference isn't as big as between the two for BTC mining, the "back to the CPU" is just silly.  There would have to be an algorithm that very specifically only works well on CPUs for whatever reason - I don't know enough of the hardware internals to point to a specific spot where a CPU would beat a GPU, though.
The absolute easiest way to defeat ASICs is really just changing the function periodically, but it would have to do so automatically on its own and have each node accept the new function as well.
( Note that when I say function in the above, it could just as well be the parameters for the function. )

Translation (because Google Translate fails miserably on Dutch):
Starting Tuesday, users of Thuisbezorg.nl (tr. Homedelivered .nl) can use Bitcoin to pay for food ordered from any of the 5,000 member restaurants that deliver.  This makes it one of the largest Dutch services to accept Bitcoin.
Thuisbezorgd.nl added support for Bitcoin primarily to give users more options, says the company.  The service has no estimation on expected popularity, but Imad Qutob - marketing manager for the site - expects that iDeal [ed. Dutch direct bank payment framework] will remain the most popular payment method by far.  "We don't think its share will  be 10 percent from the get go", he told [Tweakers](
"We believe that multiple parties could become big in online payments", he adds, "In 2009 we added support for PayPal - which wasn't as big then as it is now either."  In terms of popularity in The Netherlands, he says "It's difficult to judge how many people make use of it.  It's a chicken-and-egg story: as long as you can't pay anywhere using Bitcoin, growth of its popularity will be difficult."
Nevertheless, its support for Bitcoin is a major boost for the online currency in The Netherlands; Thuisbezorgd.nl is the 10th largest retailer in The Netherlands in terms of revenue, according to the [Twinkle100]( and roughly half of all Thuisbezorg.nl transactions are performed online.

Odds are the answer is "yes, but theory vs practice means you'd be better off actually testing" if the goal is to suggest that Random Card X (especially Random Newly Announced But Not Yet Available Card X) performs at N rate and basing a purchasing decision/recommendation on that.

Looks like a screenshot from a mining application (specifically, this looks rather like BitMinter.. but I'm sure they all kinda look alike), in which case it simply probed some registered ports to see if there happened to be a supported FPGA or ASIC device connected to it, and it determined there wasn't.  Not so much an error as an informative message.. unless, of course, there really is a device connected and it's not finding it - in which case the developers should be contacted.

No, but I guess it's mostly about the comments there (withholding money,  locking accounts, etc.) that define not even so much that 'we' use Bitcoin instead of PayPal, but Bitcoin instead of anything else that has a single entity with practically full control.
Of course there's been plenty of people who have had problems with exchanges as well, but at least there tends to be a competing business that'll work with you.  PayPal has scant few competing businesses (credit cards in general, but not every company is credit card-centric.. Google Checkout (if it's even still called that) is nowhere near as ubiquitous, etc.).

Your question is a bit incomplete.  Essentially, if you apply for a credit card in a Eurozone country, that card will have its balance in Euro.  But in usage you can use that credit card for purchases in dollars, yen, or anything else.. as long as the merchant accepts the card.
So I'm unsure what it is you're asking.  Moreover, what it has to do with Bitcoin.

The ones that accept Bitcoin and *hold* Bitcoin?  Same as most people here.. speculation.
Most don't hold Bitcoin, though - they accept Bitcoin through a services provider like Bitpay.  Bitpay on-the-fly translates the merchant's fiat price into Bitcoin, Bitpay accepts the Bitcoin, and sends the merchant their choice of fiat moneys minus Bitpay's fee; and given that Bitpay's fees are very favorable compared to credit card/paypal *and* that accepting Bitcoin can currently be seen as a good PR move.. it's almost a no-brainer.

Blackmail, extortion, etc. are 'theft' now? :)  No, in the world of the made-up crime of money laundering, the accepting of money in exchange for an organic good vis a vis another's loved one, is a perfectly valid business model.
Tax evasion is a crime.  If you want to pay less taxes, try tax avoidance instead.  Subtle difference in the first being illegal and the other legal.  Or have the tax code revised - good luck on that one, of course ;)
Of course under the premise that all tax is theft (as per another thread), then I'm sure it's not a crime.  The same applies to drug trafficking.  Or boosting cars.
Now, if you want those things to become legal endeavors, you can certainly work to make them legal (I believe some U.S. states finally legalized marijuana, although to limited extent and then there's the whole Federal side of things) - which would automatically make money gained from them not subject to money laundering.. since it's not 'dirty' money to begin with.  You could still not pay taxes on that money via tax evasion, but at least it's then unrelated to money laundering.

While security holograms can be defeated, it's pretty difficult to do so.  Here's the thing, though - if the person really wants to spend the value on the address that's associated with the coin, you can ask them to simply void the seal and perform a regular transaction.  The physical coin is now worth less*, but you'll have your Bitcoin payment.  If they're not serious about actually spending it, they would refuse to do this, or convince real hard that you should just accept the physical coin 'as is'.
\* Essentially, these physical coins may become some sort of collector's item, and as with other collectors' items, pristine ones are worth more than damaged ones.  Which is also the argument for accepting it 'as is' - since it may be worth more to you than the amount stored in the address associated with the coin.

Yes, and before that other powers who used slightly different versions (e.g. 'penning').  But (as far as I know), it's not as if by royal decree that a 1 cent monetary unit be called a penny - but rather that the term formed out of usage; ultimately it's the people who drive usage of a colloquial term for a certain denomination of money.  If there's more who agree with cffff, then maybe it'll be named something different (or dropped entirely, since it's not even on a nice SI interval) - but as it is, satoshi has precedent (and equivalent history) and widespread use on its side vs anything anybody else is going to come up with.
That said, I'm not sure why cffff would mention satoshi as an amount (as opposed to the 'author') at all - it has zero bearing on explaining Bitcoin.

You may wish to (re/x-)post to 
Just quick answers, then:  
1. That depends on what you're using to mine with.  
2. General rule is 'yes'.  Though at some point you're looking at ASIC miners in which case a more powerful *computer* will do nothing (even a cheap embedded computer type will happily interface with these), and you'd have to look at more powerful *miners* or more of them.  
3. Yes.  
4. Well if you're using your PC's CPU and/or GPU to mine with - yes, performance will be pretty bleh for anything else.  You can limit miners' taxation of the system in most clients, though.  
5. Is mining safe?  Yes.  Of course if we're talking about mining with CPU/GPU, they will get hotter, so if your machine has inadequate cooling you may destroy those.  And, if somebody finds out you're mining, you may appear to be a more attractive target for malware.  Don tinfoil hat and all that.

That's pretty big already.. there's certainly smaller.  Problem is, you also need a battery and controller (that's just the GPS, doesn't do much on its own), storage medium.  Battery alone, even if you put everything into standby or sleep mode most of the time (only wake up every 5 minutes, say, through an interrupt), would be relatively big.
The package indeed shouldn't be inspected by 'anyone', but it should be inspectable by both recipient and sender (in case of the package not being accepted by the recipient) - I may not have been clear enough on that.  The whole reason for this is to help prevent the "was sent a brick" situation.  So these are the only two parties to actually inspect a package (I'm so ignoring custom and such when sending international).
If you order a GPS, then you'd be silly to remove it, yourself.  But you can certainly check if the thing is on, hooked up to a battery, etc.  But, again, if you're sufficiently paranoid, ordering a GPS would be the kind of thing you wouldn't do through such a service :)  
The Sender would only remove the GPS for purposes of putting it back on the shelves.  Also not an issue :)

you're on r/Bitcoin - of course you'll get defensive replies.. I don't expect to get a lot of nodding in agreement going into r/Blue and proclaiming that Red poses a threat to Blue and how everybody who loves Blue is in denial ;)
That said - like I said - there's nothing stopping 'us' from doing so... it's just human nature not to unless there's a significant reason to do so.  Take VHS.. once DVDs made their way onto the market, there were lots of significant reasons to use those instead of DVDs.  Now take Blu-Ray.. sure, they're being sold, but they enjoy nowhere near the marketshare of DVDs.  Same with SD to HD, but HD to 4K is pretty much shrugged off.  Same also with MySpace to facebook, but facebook to [whatever] will need some serious upsides to not just make people want to go to [whatever], but also to *leave* facebook.
The same is the case with Bitcoin.. it has been demonstrated that Bitcoin is far from 'the ideal' cryptocurrency, for a variety of reasons.. but all the altcoins that tackle some of the concerns still fail to draw users away in any significant manner.. draw them towards, yes - obviously people are using altcoins as well - but not really to the detriment of Bitcoin.
I agree with you that Bitcoin will eventually lose out.. but eventually to me is either in a far away future, or in a near future where something 'catastrophic' happens to Bitcoin.  I'm actually not convinced that cryptocurrency is 'the' future either, though.. governments are still plenty powerful enough that, together with the financial institutions, they can come up with an alternative, tacked onto existing systems, which make people not go away from them in favor of (a) cryptocurrency/ies and where they still get a major say in its use.

Wait, how does it take you 6 months to pay for something with PayPal, exactly?
I'm not talking about getting funds out of PayPal - if I did, I could make Bitcoin transactions take arbitrarily long by saying that I want at least 200 confirmations, for example - that's the merchant side.  The rating was for 'a fast way for my customers to pay online'.  Unless you want to make Bitcoin transactions be arbitrarily short by saying that you really don't need any confirmation before telling the customer "Thank you for your business, here's your stuff" (let's say it's digital goods, for the sake of the whole "Well if you're shipping stuff, then an extra hour or so isn't going to matter" argument), because in that case.. heck, it would be instant.. but then it's merely on par with PayPal, and would you accept payment without a single confirmation?  If so, I'd love to do business with you ;)

Which is also the conclusion in the slideshow.
Apparently the statement that POW would have to change because SHA-256 would 'not survive' (see above) is courtesy of Dan Kaminski.  After some further googling, it seems that Dan isn't say that the hash function would be subject to a problem, or even the fact that miners are getting faster and faster is a problem, but that as these miners get faster while also getting to be more expensive and more specialized, chances increase that few in the world would be able to have access to those miners, which in turn leads to a greater potential for a 51% attack.

You still have your €20 bill.. it's just become useless unless you can find somebody who doesn't check the serial number.

Of course it's possible.  It's not very likely, though.

You can get the balance for a given address from e.g. blockchain.info .  The problem is that you'd have to try each and every address.. and determining the addresses that exist, first.  That's clearly a fruitless task.
The ideal method would be to grab the full ledger and start parsing from the beginning yourself.  Ideal in terms of verifiable (to you) accuracy and all that.  The down side is that you'll probably have to do this yourself.  Even blockchain.info doesn't have a 'top addresses' list for balance (they do have one for popularity - I can only assume they don't have a 'top balance' list for reasons. )
Fortunately, there are people who have done this sort of thing already.  Here's one: 
Just in case... an address is not a person.  So while you can determine the addresses with the biggest balances, a person with a much larger balance spread out across multiple addresses than the  in that list is rather likely to exist.

An SSD would be far more sensitive to those, but even an HDD isn't safe - though that may depend on how well they guard loops against EMI/ESD.  The main problem is the read/write heads - they're very sensitive to induced currents.

Please keep in mind that with credit cards you still run a similar risk.  The buyer can void the transaction with the credit card issuer typically siding with the buyer at least initially.  Worst case scenario.. 1. they get their money back, 2. they get the BTC, 3. you get problems with the credit card peeps.  Best case scenario.. You eventually get to keep their money, but you're still out the BTC.
With bank transfers that's less of a risk, given that most banks don't easily allow a transfer to be 'undone'.
There's also the option of an escrow service, though in that case both you and the buyer would have to trust that service.

Well, that's the thing - since most of them are exchanging the Bitcoin into fiat right away (perhaps even automatically and instantly, when done through a payment service), they just book it 'as is' in their administration.
If you keep it as Bitcoin, though, things get a tad more difficult and it will depend on the legislation in your jurisdiction.  A lot of countries haven't made any explicit statements on Bitcoin - in which case you should get them to do so.  Others have suggested that it's basically payment in goods and you should use the market value.. but then fail to mention whether that's market value at the time you got them, or market value at the time of filing.

Translation of public prosecutor's office statement at  :
Hackers are believed to have plundered bank accounts and performed hundreds of fraudulent transfers by installing malware on computers of Dutch bank account holders.
The police arrested four men from Alkmaar, Haarlem, Woubrugge and Roden on Monday, who are suspected of involvement in the large scale digital fraud and money laundering case.
Fake e-mails with a link that activated so-called malware gave hackers access to the computers, unbeknownst to the account holders.  Once penetrated, TorRAT manipulates internet banking by adding, modifying or removing information.  It adds new transfers of modifies existing transfer commands, invisible to the account holder.
**TorMail**  
To hide their criminal activities, the suspects made use of TorMail, a free service which allows users to send and receive messages anonymously.
The fraudulent transfers were deposited in bank accounts of 'moneymules'.  They were recruited to make their bank account available or to open new bank accounts and hand over their login data.
In order to funnel the money, business bank accounts were opened domestically and abroad.
**Bitcoins**  
In addition, the suspects assumedly exchanged ill-gotten money into Bitcoins, a form of electronic money.  One of the men operated a bitcoin exchange service, where (cash) money can be exchanged into Bitcoins.  
The public prosecutor's office seized 56 bitcoins, which have since been exchanged to more than 7700 Euro.
The police investigation focuses on the period from spring 2012 through to today, and on more than 150 fraudulent transactions.  Multiple banks and businesses have filed cybercrime reports.  The extent of the damages approaches potentially more than a million Euro.
The suspects have been taken into custody today by the magistrate of Rotterdam.

Consider the converse: has the price of Bitcoins dropped by ~22% because the overall mining effort has become more efficient?
( Making the reasonable assumption that the network rate isn't going up wildly because a billion people put their old 386s to work. )
The price is driven much more by supply/demand - and especially demand right now.  Once pure reward mining slows to a halt and doing the calculations only becomes profitable by way of reaping the rewards, difficulty - or rather the cost of running the calculations - would be a bigger factor.

Not much of an issue, since most sellers are told to be wary of selling Bitcoin over ebay and the like in the first place.  More trouble than it's worth for ebay.

\* Bitcoin is not backed by somebody willing to take them back and offer a particular value for it, therefore if nobody else wants to take them, you're "stuck with" them, and since they aren't precious metals that you can forge into trinkets or any other 'thing' with inherent value, the 'fair price' is zero.

1. That depends on one's viewpoint.  Was the distribution of gold nuggets - and with it, wealth - a concern back in the days before ye olde timey?
Bitcoin isn't meant to be 'fair' - it's not a cog in a socialist construct. ( Not blasting socialism. )
2. The possibility can't be excluded - though it's not so much a 'top of the food chain' thing and individuals with no empathy and simply a large accumulated wealth can easily be people new to Bitcoin as well - there's still plenty of Bitcoin that haven't been mined, and in the future one might expect dedicated 'mining' companies to spawn forth which will rake in vast swaths of transaction fees.

Apple doesn't have a monopoly.  That is to say, obviously they have a monopoly on iOS and OS X - they certainly do not license these out to other device makers.  But as there's reasonable other choices (windows phone, android and windows, linux, respectively), they are not considered to have a monopoly in the legal sense.  
This also means that Apple can do pretty much whatever they want - including a lot of things that Microsoft still wouldn't be able to get away with (in the EU, if nothing else) - including rejecting apps when they feel like it.

While there are some tricks you can use, do you know how many words you would actually need to encode an address?  
Let's try a very naive approach. Say you use a dictionary file so you can easily look up a word's value simply by checking its entry ID.  Some conservative guesses are that such a file may have 300,000 words for the English language.
Bitcoin addresses are encoded in Base 58.  So 58 different characters, any which one of them can be captured in 6 bits.
300,000 is just a bit under 18 bits.   So any combination of 3 characters in a Bitcoin address can be uniquely tied to a single word.
But there's 33 characters (discounting the leading character '1' (or '3')).  So 11 words.  ( You can probably get that down to 9.  It's late, and I haven't tried this in practice :) )
In addition, these words would be seemingly random.  It wouldn't form a recognizable sentence in most cases.
I'm not sure you'd really be making things more convenient :)
Perhaps the most convenient method is to use a service which ties your choice of letters, words, etc. to a Bitcoin address, similar to how a DNS service ties a domain name to an IP address.  Whether such a service could be trusted is, of course, a different discussion.  Stick it on your twitter, facebook, google+, or whatever, point people there, transfer funds to a hardened wallet upon receipt (or change the address after use).

No.  It's a way of 'tagging' a Bitcoin-style transaction (and by that I mean Litecoin, Namecoin, Feathercoin, etc. etc.) so that it can be recognized as being tagged in a certain way.  That way a transaction can be made to be not necessarily about amounts (of whatever coin) but about what that tag represents; including, potentially, ownership of physical goods.

For the consumer.  Like I said, that's not what the question was.. or at least, what it seemed to be about :P
Besides, if it costs you that 1% now, wait a few weeks and that will easily be offset ;)
I get your point, though, and I agree.. but that's more an artifact of the banking system and supply/demand from private sellers than it is of Bitcoin itself.  Credit card companies will always have a relatively high associated take because they've got a lot of associated costs - employees, real estate, issuance of physical cards, etc.  PayPal will always have their employees, server costs, etc.  All of those types of costs don't necessarily apply to Bitcoin due to its distributed nature.

If you implement it using discrete components, there's no reason you can't trust it.  Of course, there's always a chance the manufacturer of the basic BC547 actually put a tiny microcontroller in there that intentionally changes its response to cause a very difficult to detect but easy to work with characterization that makes it ideal for an NSA backdoor.

The difficulty is a ratio between the maximum target (a very large number), and the current target (a variable number).
So it's important to know what the target is.  The target is a number, big or small, which a miner's result has to be _below_ in order to have a valid result.  So the smaller that number is, the more calculations (on average) a miner has to perform.  This is essentially what RickJamesB1tch mentioned, though his explanation is a bit of a simplification (the leading zeroes) and not quite right (he's thinking of the target).
That's where the difficulty comes back in.  From the difficulty, you can roughly estimate how long it will take for a given miner to get a valid result through a simple formula:
average-seconds-to-valid-result = difficulty * 2^32 / number-of-hashes-per-second.
( Note that a miner can get a valid result in 0 seconds, or in a time much longer than what you might get a result of that equation - it's an 'odds of finding' thing, rather than a 'guaranteed to find' thing. )
Now, your follow-up question might be "so how is the current target determined?".  But that's where Google comes in ;)

How do you get it to be 'small formfactor' when you add a 'CD' port?  Or even a harddrive? (unless you're thinking mSATA but I would argue that's not even a harddrive ;) )
Overall I'm not seeing a particular advantage of this over a budget smartphone running a custom ROM that 1. does the clean-install-on-boot and 2. limits functionality to specifically that what you need (instead of the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink of 'stock' Android) - would certainly be easier to develop, too.

Why wouldn't it be ethical?
As much as I loathe the automated systems that exploit physical proximity to exchanges in order to shave microseconds off of their orders for advantages and run umpteenthousands of transactions for very very minor gains that eventually add up but screw everybody else over ... buying 1 day, selling the next?  Doesn't really compare.
And yes, you could probably make a few bucks.  But then the price keeps going up and you'll kick yourself in the face for having sold after just 1 day.  Or maybe it'll go down.  Or maybe you just won't find any buyers either which way.

That would suggest that the 5 apples I bought this morning with a fractional amount from my paycheck was money laundering - since I did not disclose to government or licensing banking institutions that I used 2 $1 notes to buy them, and they could never trace it.
There's varying definition of money laundering - none of which are acceptable to some - but the central theme to it is that you're trying to hide money gained from illicit activities.
So if I paid for those apples using $2 I got for running some groceries for an elderly neighbor it may be money laundering, if undeclared work (another made-up crime) didn't at least have a minimum before it needed to be declared anyway.
If I used $2 from $1,000,000 ransom money, on the other hand, the (presumed) kidnapping is the crime, the money gained through illicit activity, and therefore money laundering would be involved.  I doubt my grocer would be shut down for selling me some apples, despite this, though ;)
So yes, money laundering is separate from the crime, but the crime itself is what makes it money laundering in the first place.  At least, if going by that central theme.

Him having an ASIC miner doesn't detract from the fact that the problem just shifts.  Will it make mining efforts more equal than the spread we're seeing with Bitcoin?  Sure.  But just because somebody with an 5870 (as you mentioned) can be mining doesn't mean that - if the coin were to become profitable enough* - somebody else wouldn't just be throwing a dozen 7970's at the problem, and several such somebody's combining to form pools, etc.  Soon enough, that 5870 will also stop being profitable.  The process may be less jarring, but that's about it.
Good luck to him, regardless :)

They could make an 8nm PC and it would still have zero impact on 'Bitcoin mining hardware wars'.  Compared to GPUs and ASICs, CPUs are just plain underperforming given the task.

Doing with your own money what you please is not the issue in money laundering.  It's that you came by that money through illicit means that is, which makes all subsequent use of that money subject to a number of regulations.
You could probably claim that the million euro you got from a rich family for telling them where you tied up their little Johann is your money to do with as you please, that the exchange of this money through methods intended to circumvent financial transaction regulations aka money laundering is just a made-up crime, that government has no business in what you do with your money, and that the only actual crime was the kidnapping.
But then I suggest that all crimes are made-up crimes.  After all, what right do the parents have to their child?  What right does that child have to freedom?  Innate?  God-given?
Fact is, there is no such thing.  But somehow societies reached consensus that taking people's kids is a bad thing, and before you knew it, it was law.  Unsurprisingly, the same thing happened with money laundering - while I'm sure the 'criminals' in government, the banking sector, etc. etc. don't exactly mind it being a crime, neither does most of the populace.  Then there's asset forfeiture, son of sam (vastly more contested), and a whole host of other laws that dictate what you can and cannot do with 'your money' when said money is obtained through illicit means.
Now, whether LR was actually doing something illegal, whether or not the CP mention holds any basis in fact or is just designed to get a knee-jerk reaction from the general public - is another matter entirely.

Could be you, could be any of the other 9.  Now say X is you, and assume people *don't* know *that*.  Voila, you've now got some 'laundered' Bitcoin.  Of course I still know what's up, but I could conveniently lose that info, if you're willing to pay for it.

Saying 'stop using X' without saying 'start using Y instead' only works for some things.. like crack cocaine.  While I happily refer to my own averaging across several exchanges, what 'real prices' have your preference?
@_date: 2013-07-16 14:50:19
The rub lies within how you specify 'is worth' and 'it'.
For example, let's say you enjoyed a movie thoroughly.  That movie is available on Blu-Ray right now, for $18.  Is the $18 the 'it'?  If you wait a few weeks, it'll be down to $9.95.  Is *that* the 'it'?  What if the 'it' in 'worth it' is when it's down to the $3 bargain bin?
The other is even more fraught with problems.  Assume that you just watched a movie, enjoyed it from beginning to end, but at the end you go "well that was okay, but not as good as I had hoped".  But you still watched it, and you didn't outright hate it.  So how much is that movie now 'worth'?  Is it worth buying - and if so, see above.  If it's not worth buying, but you still enjoyed it, where is the balance between your enjoyment and whoever would stand to gain from your purchase that has provided that enjoyment?
This is the issue I was referring to when I say "try before you buy" tends to end up as "try before.. wait, why buy?".  Since you have already seen the movie - good or bad - there's no particular incentive for you to buy it and more likely than not you'd be swayed to 'not buy' or at least 'buy when it's much cheaper'.
Don't get me wrong, I fully agree that it sucks if you buy a movie full price and it's a stinker, and I absolutely believe you should have the right to evaluate a movie before making a purchasing decision - trailers (or demos for games) tend to give a distorted view and reviewers are not necessarily aligned with your likes and dislikes.  But unless you set very strict rules for yourself on buy/at what price/don't buy that are fair and balanced, the above applies.
Maybe you're part of the group of rare exceptions though.  I know 1 guy who is, and who is often the subject of mockery by the more frequent downloaders-never-buyers (downloading is legal here, so they see no reason not to), so I wouldn't be entirely surprised.

Ah, sorry - 'return on investment'.  Basically, how much you're making back in mined Bitcoin vs the initial expenditure (buying the miner + shipping + any other initial setup costs) + ongoing costs (electricity, primarily, since most other ongoing costs would be pre-existing.. e.g. rent, internet access, etc.).
@_date: 2013-05-27 12:37:26
That would be a non-discussion.  I have no definition of "money laundering" that couldn't be constituted as relying on papers written by the organized criminals, the thieves, the institutionalized mob (too much?) known as the "government", either directly, or indirectly, or under pretenses of coercion of the writer (who presumably lives under a government), or increasingly convoluted "yes, but" situations.
Basically, you have the easy part of any engagement by suggesting that money laundering is made up.  After all, if it is made up, then you needn't provide any definition, since it essentially doesn't exist.
Which means the other party to any discussion will have to define that, despite it being made up, it can be defined and defended.  Except you then make your own rules as to what constitutes a good defense.  "The government says so" is out (which I'll happily agree with), but "Society as a whole" is also out, since society is only part of the driving factor, and not that which gets to define it as an order ready to be disobeyed, as you put it.  Even "I believe a wrongdoer (because criminals just disobey orders) should not be allowed to subvert financial regulations in order to hide their financial gains from that wrongdoing" wouldn't be accepted, since that falls just as well under "other people's opinions".
A better discussion would be about why you believe the opposite; why doing what you want with your money, regardless of its source (or destination), is something that should not be regulated. (Or in this case, others' money, since it's LR, not its clients directly, that is targeted.)

 has a nice list of past difficulties and their relative increases/decreases.  You'll note that certainly recently it's been a steady increase of around 30%.  This trend is not likely to cease soon.  So while right now it may take more than 10 minutes on average, as more (ASIC) miners come online, toward the end of the 2 week period that time will have gone down again (see also the 2nd graph on that page).

If your basic question is "Why buy Bitcoin if you can buy Litecoin instead?", then you've already answered your question..in your question.  Bitcoin has the lead in adoption right now.
If you mean long-term, in a potential market where Litecoin (just as an example) has the same or even better market adoption - then you're right, there's no particular reason why you would use Bitcoin instead of Litecoin.  
vs some other virtual currencies would depend on the virtual currency in question.
I was merely addressing the specific question I quoted :)

They're basically talking about allowing PayPal to supplant gift/loyalty cards.  That Red Lobster gift card could then exist virtually inside your PayPal account.  Regal loyalty card? PayPal.  Airmiles? PayPal.
Which is more a jab at / heading off Amazon than it is some embrace of Bitcoin/Litecoin/whatever.  Hence the mention of Google/Apple - Google would love for their own payment system to take off large, and the Android devices are just the thing to do so.  Apple have the same ambition, and of course already have a pretty good stake in it by telling subscription services to go through their service (and pay the nn% to Apple) or buzz off and not be deliverable through iOS.  Ebay wants a slice of that pie.

tl;dr: embargoes against Cuba - to which PayPal is subject - are the cause here.  Obviously the thought is "if only you'd use Bitcoin!" - but if that Bitcoin were processed through a U.S. company, or the crowdfunding platform of choice were based in the U.S. (the two more popular ones seem to be, though surprise surprise they have meagre information on this), they would be subject to the same regulation.  
( Though I'm not sure if the platform itself would be required to block the project. )
So this is more a story of "don't use services with a presence in the U.S. when dealing with anything Cuba".

I don't think it can be.  Not only would a more accurate visual depiction of Bitcoin look horribly hacker/the matrix-ish (how *do* you depict something virtual anyway, right?), but you'd have to somehow get it to be more popular than the shiny, colorful media images from Casascius.
I'm also not sure it's actually a problem.  Anybody who thinks the tokens *are* Bitcoin are at least not completely mistaken, anybody who wants to find out more will easily get informed, and those who already know better hopefully appreciate the fact that these 'cute tokens' help prevent people's eyes from glossing over immediately after reading the opening paragraph of most Bitcoin stories ;)

slightly more nuanced opinion compared to sandersh6000 - based mostly on the fact that the value of diamonds is largely a created one (they're not even the prettiest of shiny things, marketing just has a whole lot of people believing that they are) - gold (and diamonds, and silver, etc.) has certain physical properties that make them very interesting for certain purposes.  The demand for those materials for those purposes combined with the scarcity of the materials causes them to have a certain value regardless of what people 'think' it to be worth.
As to your "how many chickens is it worth" type argument - of course, though that's not a question of intrinsic value vs no intrinsic value.

They should, though.  mailto: is actually one of the exceptions.

While there are others that do not use the double-slash (thus only specifying a path, and not an optional authority and the double-slash is used a lot for handlers that do not ever use an authority part, I think the double-slash form is appropriate.

Not sure if I should upvote for 'ASCII miner', or downvote for even mentioning BFL ;)  The general gist is right, though.. the lower-end miners have no chance of positive ROI, the higher-end ones have a better chance given the high exchange rate right now.. but delivery times can still push even those back down to negative ROI.  If I had $10k laying around and guaranteed overnight delivery and no DoA, it'd be an easy decision.

In addition, consider installing an url expander / de-shortener add-on; though keep in mind that this necessitates sending the URL to a server in order to figure out the expanded URL.  
Alternatively, most of the popular URL shortening services allow you to enable a preview mode, allowing you to check what the URL points to before it forwards (tends to work only 1 shortened URL deep, so doesn't work too well on twitter's shortened URLs which are often themselves based on shortened URLs).

But that's not the merchant's problem.  Your argument was about *accepting* Bitcoin.  Unless you want to go through the whole route of "if patrons have to spend more in order to buy then they need to be paid more in their wage which drives up the cost of their business and drives up the cost of another business and then another and so on until the merchant has to pay their supplier which is one of those businesses so eventually that is still the merchant's cost".  Though that would still apply to credit cards and the like anyway =)

Ah, no, I'm not a 'hater' of mining.  I know there's profit to be made, but the market circumstances (right now) dictate that you'll need at least a mid to high level miner, which is generally more upfront cost than most people are willing to throw at it (or rather, than they have). Of course before prices spiked, mining really *was* practically pointless (in terms of hoping to see a positive ROI) unless you were willing to do as you say - see it as a long term thing and hope the rates go up quite disproportionally to the difficulty.  I may make too many assumptions about those who ask about mining, myself (e.g. that they're hoping to turn a quick profit, that they can do it for cheap, etc.) - something to better myself on :)

While some of these come down to a subjective aspect, I wonder how you figure "Is a fast way for my customers to pay online" ranks a 7 for PayPal and a 10 for Bitcoin.
While it's true that it's not exactly slow to send in the transfer of Bitcoin, the 2-3 clicks required for PayPal aren't exactly the domain of the sloth either.  What happens next, on the other hand, is that PayPal gives your site a nudge saying payment was completed, while Bitcoin says "Please hold while the network sets to work to verify this transaction.  This can take several minutes."

Since nobody bothered to mention - the specific physical coin depicted is a [Casascius coin](
They work exactly the same way as a [paper wallet]( - except that obviously the medium is metals and plastic.  'safer' really depends on what you're going for with that question.  Yes, losing one would be easy - but like any paper wallet, it's probably safer than an online, let alone live, storage.

And if they just keep the $30 they've got.. $30.  Maybe they'll eventually have $32 when put into a bank account.  Or maybe they can buy food with it which they desperate need.  Or they just want short term satisfaction and buy some computer game with it.

Mainly because the unary form is what is generally considered to be the base element.  E.g. 1 Bitcoin is the base, with a 'kilobitcoin' being 1000 Bitcoin.  Early on, the name Satoshi was given to what essentially would be '10 nanobitcoin'.  
We've done similar things with existing currencies.  Just to pick an easy one: the penny.  It's technically a centidollar, but we named it 'a penny'.  But that doesn't mean a whole dollar in effect becomes a hectopenny.
The argument could be made that the unary value is arbitrary and could be redefined to be the Satoshi.  That would require coordination and consensus that I don't think would be easily found, though - especially since other units derived from 1BTC as unary are already fairly well-established, such as the millibit.
In the end, though, these things tend to develop naturally, if at all.  Nobody says they've got 2 kilodollars or 1 megaeuro or 5 decayen, and very few would refer to "a one hundred dollar bill" as 'a Benjamin' outside of lyrics associated with certain musical styles.  Still, we might end up with [Ringo](

I think the actual complaint would be that the comparison isn't apt.
If I share my own movie, practically nobody cares.

If I 'share' somebody else's movie without their permission, it's copyright infringement; they still have their copy of the movie.  
If I 'share' somebody else's Bitcoin without their permission, it's theft; they no longer have their Bitcoin.

"A move away from ASICs, and back to mining with CPUs!"
Wait, don't they mean "back to mining with an abacus, notepad, and pencil - pen for the daring"?
While I understand that a change would effectively cripple an ASIC that is designed for only a given function, there's the FPGAs, the multi-GPU mining rigs, single GPUs and, heck, the botnets still well inbeteen ASIC and CPU.  Besides, thanks to now-established manufacturing and shipping setups, a new ASIC design would be quick to follow as long as it would remain profitable to do so (for the sellers, who can sell to the highest bidding miner, if that miner never actually breaks even that's not their problem).  The function would have to change periodically to keep ASICs out long-term.

The thing about heatsinks is that their efficiency is limited based on how thermally conductive they are in their base material, and how well they can lose the heat to the environment.  That environment is, short of convection, pretty much the stale - and warm - air around that heatsink.  A fan will generally perform better, but there are limits to both approaches which often warrant using both (thus heatsink+fan in laptops, on high power LED lighting products, etc.)

Just look at generic file encryption utilities.  GPG is a good cross-platform one.  I'm a fan of Axcrypt myself due to the ability to make a self-contained executable that prompts for the password.. but I don't know if this stands the test of time well.. in a few decades there may not be computers that will run that executable without a VM ;)  You can always use 7-zip and others to created encrypted archives of files.  Another option is to not store the paper wallet, per se, but just your key pair, in something like KeePass (which does also allow file attachments in database records, which get encrypted all the same).
