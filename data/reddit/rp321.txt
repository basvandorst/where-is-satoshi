Sure, although it can be misleading when out of 20,000 numbers(BTC peak) the first 1000 take up 80% of the chart, leaving the other 19,000 (95% of the numbers) occupying the remaining 20%. 
This makes the 50% drop look like it didn't even touch the price, and the it will basically only register on that chart when it drops back to 1,000

Anyone else have buy points for this dip? What can we expect during this correction. I sold at 12k a bit ago during the first set of crashes.
I'm weary of getting burned though. 3k? 5k? 9k?

1$-1000$ take up nearly 80% of the graph leaving the dips basically unnoticeable for more recent pricings.
I mean come on, 2.20$ ~ 3.15$ occupy the same amount of space as 10,000$ ~ 14,215$ which makes the -50% recent dip look like basically nothing, it doesn't look like it even lost 3% according to the graph, or even 2%.

if it goes below 14k i'm selling
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:15:45
No, you won't be tricking me into selling my BTC. Just the other day at school all of my friends at the lunch table were talking about how they were all going to be billionaires by the time they were 18. 
Thats when I knew right then and there, this is it. Noone will have to work if they invest in BTC. It will just keep going up in the long run.

MtGox is going to crash the bitcoin market twice aren't they.. What the fuck. Confiscate their coins!

Bank shills are spreading fud. I have confronted quite a few of them on both 4chan and reddit. Call them out for working for mastercard or bank of america and watch them stop responding.

BTC hits 4k then bounces around from 10-25k before mooning all the way to 100k with everyone declaring fomo.
At this point I can only feel sympathy for those carrying fiat. I generally try to tell my coworkers about crypto but those dip is making it awkward as they try to do the "told you so" routine.

It may cost 5k to produce a coin, but it isn't locked at that. Miners will just stop mining if it isn't profitable - or it will be severely limited to scenarios where people get free electricity or something. 
Think about it, it shot up 20x in a year, it isn't "locked" to the price it was at just 5 months ago (5k).

As long as it stays above 1.5k suicide won't be on the table.
if it gets below that though..
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:38:06
It only reached 20k or even 10k or even 3k because basically there wasn't a drop at all. It was a straight shot directly to the top and everyone wanted in.
Now that people are aware that buying BTC isn't the same thing as 100xing your money for no risk and it can fall it won't have that same mentality surrounding it.
Lots of people will be burned in a market that can't afford people to try crypto then hurrily get out.

You are the guy who was sayng BTC was going to 4k. Maybe your bags aren't being adopted but we, the premiums are.

Great, I am financially ruined again. Thanks guys. This makes me look bad in front of my family.

Just a little something I have written in my free time, enjoy.
I've been on r/bitcoin , ending in dirty down votes.
List'ning to the weak hands, thinking 'bout this 'n' that.
They said, "its Soros, its the stock market, its FUD, look at this projection, Bart Simpson, this and that.
Turn it down a little bit or turn it down flat.
Pump it up, when you don't really need it Pump it up, until you can feel it.
Down in the pleasure centre, hell-bent or heaven-sent.
Listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander.
There's nothing underhand that weak hands wouldn't understand.
Pump it up, until you can feel it Pump it up, when you don't really need it.
Bitcoin been a bad dip, like a chemical Though you try to stop it, Bitcoin like a narcotic You want to sell high, you want to talk to buy low.
All the coins you bought for your portfolio, putting up your temperature.

Now that the bear market is over should we be getting our family/friends etc involved?

Nocoiners... I feel sympathy. You hold nothing, You are on the sidelines watching the bullrun. You missed the bottom and are now lashing out at those with superior investing iq.

Are people getting mugged at these bitcoin ATMs.. Wow.. All of our whales are getting mugged. Something needs to be done and quick. Esp. in 3rd world countries where they rely on these exchanges..
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:57:19
I don't want to get burned again, ATM I am very unpopular at work due to some bad timing investing advice. It was actually good investing advice however the timing was off. 
Now that we are looking at a bull market for the next few years I am wondering if I should start gathering investors for the next run.
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:33:40
Right.. This is why I waited for the bull market to start. I do not want people to miss out on 10xing profits.
I will not be blamed as the final decision to invest is not mine to make, and I firmly tell people that I wasn't at fault if they took my advice to invest in December or January.
However this is backfiring because even though they are not blaming me, they are still resentful.

I was willing to lose it, my wife however was not. Now I am looking bad with empty pockets.
