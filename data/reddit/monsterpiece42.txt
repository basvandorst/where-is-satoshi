Maybe. I see it could fall into one of two roles: either it will be the "gold" of crypto--the end-store of value, or it could become irrelevant as people become more educated about everything.
Time will tell.

As a casual day/swing trader, I go by "pigs get fat, but hogs get eaten". 
I might not min/max my returns but I'd rather get a reliable steady stream with my exchange money. 
Hodl money is different..  just don't touch it.

Doesn't do much good if you never get to the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:23:52
Yes it is, but transfer to GDAX and send out from there. Free to do so, and much faster. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:28:36
Never said anything about merit. Hell gold is a shiny rock and it's the store of value for everything else. People like old things.

And always cash out when you walk away!

I don't know how to state it simpler. When there's a hard fork, you get an equal amount of the new coin as whatever you currently hold of the original coin.

Gotcha, thanks. :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:34:49
Thank you for being the only person here that knows this is happening.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:04:59
I see BTC like gold: it's for value store, not for exchange. Other cryptos work much better as currency imo

"new statement"
...lol that's not OP.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:37:11
Huh, good to know. For the record, it does start  with 1. Apparently they're "adding SW passport soon" so maybe new users have one that supports it. I've had mine since pre-SW.

Some lessons are expensive. Be grateful you're willing to learn. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:44
cracked 19k before GDAX crashed lol
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:13:51
Not sure, honestly. It went to a Mycellium wallet on my phone for now, so I can own my private keys. 
It's a holdover until I get a Trezor or similar. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:02:52
What is FOMO?
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:44:19
So I'm using Mycellium on my phone as a wallet until I get a "real" hardware wallet. Will I get my B2X from the fork like that or should I move it?
I also have a little bit on Binance, anyone know if that will give me the forked amount?
Edit: maybe instead of downvoting me you guys could follow this shit. The new coin jacked the SegWit name and will be called B2X. It's launching in a couple days.

Add and remove funds for Coinbase, and then "Market" and "Stop" sales/purchases on their affiliate site GDAX. GDAX is fairly reasonable, but Coinbase is kinda steep especially if you use a card instead of pulling directly from/into your bank account (ACH).
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:20:13
That one is green and tilted the other way. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:30:19
BCH is dumb. Fits.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:38:46
Well TIL. Everyday I learn something, and see how little I know haha
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:58:04
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:10:19
The exchange is going apeshit right now, everyone is making transactions so it's probably taking a while from that
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:14:54
Even so, I didn't know it would even be possible to move BTC that fast under any conditions. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:59:49
I was personally willing to put up with the drama and the unprofessionalism to use 0-fee GDAX, but it's so buggy I went over to binance. The fees are worth it, to me at least.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:53:23
My gut says LN will drive up, otherwise a slow bear market until it's very low. Let's keep out fingers crossed

Exclamation point goes on the other side

That's good to hear considering your name. Keep on keeping on man. :)

Yes that's why he said he doesn't care and is sticking with them....
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:52:46
Or part of one coin. I'm low income, and have been buying a couple a few buck's worth here and there over the last couple months. Made about $100 so far! Not much compared to some, but $100 is $100!
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:52:56
Who knows. I just picked a ridiculous number to make a point. I hope it goes to the moon once I get a good chunk in it haha
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:50:49
You seem to follow this. If there's a fork, if I have 1BTC, does that mean I also get 1BTCx, leaving me with both? Do I pick? Where would I read more?
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:30:21
That's what I'm thinking. I'm calling that it dips for the fork, and then goes back up when people realize the fork is shit.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:22:50
This is a good point, but with the way things have been climbing (10%/day, ish), you might make your money back before you save for the next chunk (like another $10).
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:28:04
My man.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:32:31
Half a billion is just as nice a lifestyle as a whole billion IMO.
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:21:06
Yeah I intend to order a TREZOR or Ledger as soon as one of them makes a plan about the potential fork. For now I have put all my BTC in Mycelium so at least I have private keys and I can cash in on the "doubling" if I choose to go that way. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:18:32


What's that? Pardon, I'm a newb newer than the last fork. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:31:55
I keep seeing fiat, what is it?
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:19:58
Fuuuuuck I cashed out $600 to flip a car and the shit spikes $800/coin. I better hurry up and sell that bitch! 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:31:03
Whoops, sorry. I just assumed it was more reddit slang. Thanks
