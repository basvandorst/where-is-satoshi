That would be beneficial if I wasn't sure if the price of gas would be 100 one day and 1000 the next.

Well I hit my minimum with NiceHash in a Month, and Pretty sure it would run the same with Minergate, I'm just not sure where to place the effort
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:53:37
aren't fees percentage based?
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:11:57
Kraken gives me an address. Can't I just move it from one to the next? Or I need an actual wallet to move from CEX to wallet then to Kraken?

so you built hmm. what hashrate are you getting if you don't mind me asking? I'm trying to kinda moneyball it and buy the cheapest stuff that will pay for itself the fastest kinda thing

"but why?" just by virtue of ease of mining?
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:04:33
I feel like paying for cloud mining is counter intuitive, wouldn't it cost me less to just buy the coin?
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:03:34
I do, but my country is quite small and nobody here will pay me in bitcoin for my services
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:25:43

Doesn't say anything. The "Withdraw" button doesn't light up.
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:54:57
I live in a place with basically free electricity.

It's not much of a rig to be fair. It's either I jump in with a decent rig or I jump out entirely.
