As most cryptocurrencies are traded for bitcoin before converting into "cash" the strength of other coins will strengthen the bitcoin as you will have to convert to bitcoin first. However when the bitcoin becomes stronger this does not necessarily means the other coins will get stronger as buying these coins in the first place (with bitcoins) will be more expensive because the rise in bitcoin price.

He is not suggesting to buy bitcoins at a high price and sell them at low ;) that would be crazy, he just means that if the bitcoin breaks the $3800 enough support would be established to kick it up further. When it doesn't go above $3800 he believes you are just wasting money when buying as it will then never kick up for good profits.

Hi wohlstand,
Sad to hear you don't like the website :(
I actually put a lot of effort in the site.. 
The website aggregates the news from lots of news website (via rss) so you have all latest crypto related news in one place. As I only use what info the sites make publicly accessible (via there rss) and I don't rip it off the website by copy pasting, sometimes only short part of the articles are displayed and to read the full article you can click the link below the article.
Sorry you don't like it, hope you will find some other articles on the site you might find useful.
Kind regards,

The more people/organizations accept bitcoin as a payment method, the closer we get to disrupting the corrupt monetary banking system ����
