Yeah, they lose time every time they want to pay you in sending fiat money into an exchange, then buy BTC, then send that BTC to you. 
Easier to send you a normal usd payment. Easier for their bills (they have to do their taxes every year as everybody).
Easier to find a new freelance.

You’ll die with a lot of bitcoins in your wallet.

And how would you charge it?
Let’s say you charge it $1000 dollars per month normally. Two days ago that would be 0.0869565 BTC. Today that would be 0.1012658 BTC. It’s to much change of value to be factible for him. 
He needs to buy BTC to pay you in BTC. He buys one day at $10,000, and the next day it’s at $9000. He already lose $1000 in one day just trying to satisfy one FREELANCE worker.
It’s cheaper to find a new freelance that accepts pays in USD.
If you are having troubles with fees in banks, then you should charge a higher amount to your client.
Again, let’s imagine you normally charge $1000 per month. After bank fees you keep, I don’t know, $950usd. But you want to get $1000. Well, then charge $1050usd to your client, explain why you are charging that and that’s it. That’s how normally freelancers charge their clients, they include bank feeds and taxes in their fees.
Many people probably already pays you in BTC, but it’s not viable for many businesses to use this scheme. It’s to volatile yet. We have gone from $5200 usd to $12575 usd to $9150 usd in the last 3 months. Imagine that kind of changes for the people that it’s paying you.
It’s a lose - lose for them.

Sue, and don’t forget to cancel your account there and open a new one in another bank (and make sure they have no troubles with Bitcoin).
Isn’t there any institution you can go and start a complain?

If you bought yesterday for the first time. Yes, you are loosing a lot of money. But probably a lot of people in this Reddit bought many months ago (or years), so they aren’t loosing any right now. And if everybody starts to sell, then the things will go worst.
But even if you bought yesterday, selling right now is a big lose. It’s a better idea to hodl.

It’s already at $11500. It probably will reach$10,000 again, but it’s more probable that it will be $12000 for tomorrow. Who knows.

It depends. How many mates do you have on Uranus?

This is the kind of advertisement that will take Bitcoin to the moon. Finally!

According to prediction from past years, right now it should be flying from the moon to mars.
Predictions are irrelevant.

When you say “to invest” I imagine you mean “I have $1200 burning my hands and I need to get rid of them”.
If that’s the case, go ahead. And watch every day how the market is. It’s very possible that it will continue going up in the next few days so you’ll win a little bit more.
But if those are your savings for vacations, furniture or whatever, don’t do it. One day you can wake up and realize you just lost $1200.
If you have money “to invest” it means that you are ready to lose that money.
