This actually pisses me off now - They aren't just doing advertisments - I run a Bitcoin  poker and a Bitcoin buy and sell group.  For both, I had an introductory guide which got deleted a few weeks back, it was pages long and took me days to write - It went missing, no trace of edits, publishes, history etc, just gone.  This has to have something to do with that?

I use gold as a comparison because it's an asset with properties outside of it's financial properties, that add utility, not pegged to the price.  As gold, Bitcoin is the same, in a digital context.  If you can't understand that it's not my fault you're closed minded.

All I am saying is - we're in Bitcoin, we're all about transparency etc.  HOW do we ensure that these exchanges are not doing this?  If we're working with a transparent ledger on the Bitcoin blockchain, why are the main exchanges / onboarding avenues not transparent?  I;m sure there is a way to legitimize the funds or understand how trades are represented by ACTUAL assets and ACTUAL backing in the account that is trading?  
   
  
I have been here since MT. Gox.  And I am not FUDING.  I am asking questions that if can't be answered by anything but this is FUD, well then maybe there is some equity to the acquisitions.   Not EVERYTHING is FUD.  There is legitimate concerns and discussions to be had here, FUD is a scapegoat for turn a blind eye to a debate / discussion that is important to have.

Bitcoin / other crypto currencies bring huge value to merchants -  there's not a good alternative that doesn't gouge the merchant and consumer in digital payments, other alternatives - Paypal and cc networks basically.  Interchange and merchant account fees are huge, I got into Bitcoin because of working in the cc processing industry partly, it really enables businesses with small margins.

1.  You're completely off track here.  It's an alternative.  Just as gold acts as an alternative metal / conductor, store of value etc, Bitcoin is the exact same in a digital context.  It's a platform for development, but it functions as value storage, digital means of transactions, p2p transfers, automated data basing that is transparent, cmon, don't limit Bitcoin so much in your head to simply 2 reasons why people are passionate about it, it goes way further than your personal bias, I promise!    
Your pessimistic approach isn't helping anyone, and of course it's not going to be high number, Bitcoin is still in it's infancy.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with supporting a business accepting Bitcoin.  When I came here around $100, Bitcoin was being used as a B2C currency and it was doing a great job.  Nowadays, it's not, and I think the future payment channels will be built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.  Still doesn't hurt sharing a brand that has opened the doors to it as a currency regardless. Why cringe, I think there are other cringeworthy things with a bigger impact than focusing on cringing when another entity is accepting Bitcoin, jesus.

I was working at a payment processor and we got hit with a 20,000 ransom last year.  Step 1 - police.  Gave up on the CPS when they came for a meeting that turned out to be a tutorial on how they should view and reply to emails.  It was fucking insane.  Step 2 - Buy backup servers, 20,000 worth.  Never happened again, if it did we would migrate to the new setup.    
   
Step 3  *one day* will be accountability.   I feel bad for OP, but one day, the reverse will play itself out, and the people behind these randoms will learn that if they want to attack innocent people, the consequences for them will not be worth it.   I can't wait for the day they are exposed.

They can implement their own blockchain, in fact they are trying.  The issue stems from transparency and legitimacy.  Bitcoin is strong in this neighborhood because it's distributed around between parties around the world.  When the bank creates their own, it's touch to know anything is legitimate, as they own the blockchain, they could adjust accordingly, or implement their own checks and balances that aren't verified by anyone but their executives.    
   
Bitcoin can be banned, but it's usage will not falter.  This is one of it's benefits.  Where there is internet, there is access to Bitcoin.

Quick micro-loans without the need for a payment processor taking 3 + % interchange on each transaction + lender fees etc.  I can see that there *is* indeed a reason, the problem is, I wouldn't be surprised if the people at the top of BTCJam have a vested interest in giving higher ratings to loans that will default.  Basically, a smaller version of the housing bubble in the USA that happened a few years ago.  Inflate credit ratings to defaulting loans and repeat, bet against the loans (or have someone take the loans on your behalf with a payout), make a killing.

Where's the tangible evidence that this is directly related to BU?  Graphs over time?  Because as far as I am aware, BU has been around for awhile, and Bitcoin's growth as of late has been huge.  Anyone can pick a timeframe, just as the people we're teaching about Bitcoin suggesting it's highs and lows over a specific timeframe are unfeasible, anyone can take any specific period and make assumptions.  
  
Not suggesting you're wrong, but these claims should eb supported by long-term trends and tangible evidence that this is the case.    
  
Everyone in here has has a conversation with someone currently not interested in Bitcoin in which they have taken a stance due to a particular time frame of extreme growth or decline, and I guarantee you've had to debate why choosing a tiny time-frame isn't an accurate potrayal, we should do the same.

Bitcoin a. is the MySpace of Bitcoin, in your opinion.  b. Bitcoin is used because people find use cases with it.  When another rivals adoption of Bitcoin, maybe it will be the goto.  But for now, there isn't another that comes close, why?  Because you can use Bitcoin for things, not just a hope to be an early adopter on the next get rich quick scheme.
  
Nobody is forcing you to, in fact, there are multiple sub reddits including r/cryptocurrency that cover others in detail.  You've seen the alt currencies, why not join those subs?      
  


     
If you see another crypto currency that rivals it for adoption and realistic utility, people will use it.  For the time being, Bitcoin is the most fungible of the rest, but nobody is forcing you to stay on the MySpace, you can always login to the Facebook and adopt that.
      


   
Yes, people also agree the other way, are you suggesting this is a majority, and if you are can you provide some statistics to support?   
  
Edit: After rereading your original post     
  


   
   
You're looking for a quick way to get rich, and it hasn't happened, I see where the negativity is now coming from.  There's a handful of high risk investments out there, spread your wings.

What is your ideal Bitcoin?  What value does Bitcoin bring to you?  Have you been let down because you expected to get rich quick and we've seen a recent decrease?    
   
The reason I ask is because there is people sending money internationally, cheap without reliance on 3rd party services.  There is businesses accepting Bitcoin which have avoided very high rates imposed by credit card networks.  There is some that are nervous about access to finances, or uneasy about keeping money in a third party service known as banks.   
  
For all these situations, Bitcoin is living up to expectations.     
   
I am curious what you value in Bitcoin and why you're feeling let down.

Fixed rates or trading fees.  These come under different guises and each is going to give a different kind of trader a different benefit. High volume trader, save with fixed fees.  Low volume, transaction based. Some exchanges only place fees on one side of the order, others fees on all trade etc.

Congratulations that's awesome.  Hold em if you're not tight on cash or don't immediately need the finances.  If you need to convert them, google "bitcoin exchange" and find a place where you can swap up conveniently in your region.  The other options are google "bitcoin ATM near me" to find a Bitcoin ATM in your area, there you can sell them for cash at a bit of a premium.  You can always sell some and keep some or use them to purchase things, pay bills, send family members or friends money for relatively nothing over long distances or around the world.  Always use passwords where prompted in your wallet and be careful what info you're providing others!  Anyone in here claiming to hodl or hold is banking on Bitcoin's rise.  Nobody in here is qualified to say that it's going to rise or decline, it could go either way, at any time.   Right now we're a bit lower than the last few days, but Bitcoin has seen a dramatic increase over the last few months, I recommend doing a little research and finding out if you believe it will stay this high, rise or drop.

You and ev ev every one in here has that option, that's a pretty important aspect of the Reddit platform.  What's also important is sparking a discussion of "what" exactly Bitcoin is, "who" Bitcoin brings value to and what is important to preserve in the future of it's existence.

Turn your blinders off buddy.  Open your ears and eyes and look at the option of others.  That's the second plague of this shit, is the people who have formed an opinion and refuse any sort of compromise -  Half these motivations are supported with a piss poor understanding of what they actually defend.

Discussion is the basis for growth.  How did BU fail?  Was there any positives take from it that can be carried over?  Was BU a plan generated by some community members for personal benefit?  Why was BU gaining traction, can those tactics be used to grow Bitcoin in general?  Why was it such a failure, and how can that be avoided in the future?  Can we find any failsafes from the BU that ensure we're protected from any bugs in future implementations?   
     
I think the discussion is good for moving in a positive direction.  We can use the recent events as a positive, and some could argue the disfunction over BU, and the communities response might generate more mainstream media than if the community was stagnant the whole time.  This situation for all we know is a great display of how the community has come together to make decisions in a consensus based system.   
   
Discussion is good it's how the community grows.

This is a common thing today... Happens on eBay all the time, people make fake accounts to inflate their prices and make it look like their is active demand / bidders.  Found on BTCJam that this is more evident than ever, fake lenders lending to fake borrowers, inflating scores and then they bounce on the big loan.        
   
Sorry this happened to you.... In the future, this place is filled with scams.  I recently got my ANX account and my Bitfinex accounts highjacked after I found my account information  on Bitcointalk forums.  Don't trust anyone in here... Like, nobody.  If the transaction requires trust, don't do it.  People in here have made fake donation initiatives for dead people and stolen the money, like there is really no boundaries for how low some of these people will go.  *You will get scammed if trust is involved in the equation*

This is the true foundation behind Bitcoin. So many posts of people becoming discouraged, and that Bitcoin isn't reaching it's potential, and the innovation is dead - Underlying reason is that it didn't get these users rich quick.  If you look at remittances, if you look at the Grexit, if you look at the processing fees behind merchant credit card payments, Bitcoin is doing it's job absolutely perfectly.

Why would they be the most important thing for mainstream adoption?  That's beside the point of adoption.  Adoption comes when there is tangible value provided.  Purchasing 1 Bitcoin as a whole is perception, as that's not an accurate judgement of the actual purchasing process.    
   
Utility that adds value to peoples lives will see usage and adoption increase.   
   
Edit: Stages of consumer adoption - Awareness, interest, evaluation, trial, adoption.  If you *had* to buy one Bitcoin, that might be an issue for on-boarding -  But that's not the case I don't think.

You're taking a stance on something, with 0 evidence it actually has any impact whatsoever.  You're suggesting that your opinion is *greater* than any statistics, and you should be believed over recorded, true, trustworthy, historical data, which is quite funny, as one of Bitcoin's promoted interests is recorded historical evidence and data.     
  
When you suggest evidence is unnecessary to back your statement, your opinion essentially becomes useless.  "In three days all because of fork" -  How the fuck did you arrive at that?  You have *nothing* to provide that shows any correlation.

Here's the big take aways from this:   
- Payment processing for cannabis companies has been a HUGE issue as credit card networks will not allow it, forcing companies to hold large amounts of cash.  Companies keep getting their processing options shut down.  Without digital payment processing, you're business is in trouble when your merchant account is closed.   
         
-The company is led by Square!    
   
   
   
  
   


   
Square is a leader in Fin Tech innovation.  Square involved with Bitcoin is HUGE news. Not only does it bring thier innovation to Bitcoin payments, it shows that they are interested in Bitcoin -  This is a company that understands  payment trends from top to bottom, their interest in Bitcoin show's that a bunch of smart minds have faith in the Bitcoin network as alternative form of merchant payments that brings value, I would keep posted for more news in this area.

- Purse.io 20% off amazon
**A business model easily working with other mediums of payments. Awesome idea, but not proprietary to Bitcoin's utility.**     
- Gambling online even if you are underage   
**Going to hard to get the "average" person on board with this one.**     
  
- Buy any drug you want online  **Depending upon the regulations in the region, this could be a usage, but it's still nothing new, or proprietary to Bitcoin's utility.** 
  
- Bitcoin can never be taken from you if you are a criminal or drug dealer. Unlike cash. **This is completely 100% false.**   
   
- You can sale goods online to anyone all over the world and not pay taxes.   
**This is tax evasion and has nothing to do with Bitcoin.  If you want to avoid taxes, you can do it easily with cash, without a paper trail.  This is not a good usage of Bitcoin either and tax evasion is going to fuck you over, especially if it's documented nicely in a database lol**   
   
    
This is a hilarious display of lacking knowledge between Bitcoincoiners.  You have just outlined a whole bunch of ideas that *don't* appeal to the average person, better yet, none of these outline a single unique benefit that Bitcoin actually provides.  Slow clap.
   
   
Merchants are paying 3.6% and up for merchant accounts that process credit cards in card-not-present environments.  Today, businesses are forced to pay this to accept credit cards.....  Credit cards remain the prioritized online payment, which limits and forces merchants to pay companies llike visa 3.6% of their total online income.. That's insane. This is where Bitcoin holds utility and allows merchants to offer discounts, they can avoid the 3.6%.   
    
  
Recurring payments without 3.6 - 9% fees... 9% seems a lot.... But once you factor in 3.6% + the service fees, typically 5% for a recurring platform, and now your dashboard for customer interaction and adjustments.  This gets pretty damn expensive.   Recurring payments built around Bitcoin could significantly reduce fees, but there is stil a need to pay support and such.  I'm not too sure which platforms offer recurring billing, but here's an outline of how expensive it is to process recurring billing between companies right now... It's expensive.    -  Hopefully adding Bitcoin processors, if there are any in the near future.   
  
Legal online gambling.... I came across a post a longtime ago that outlined online gaming settlements.  There is huge opportunity here to remove expensive man power in return for automated distribution of payments upon a condition being met...   
   
Legal online gambling - Quick deposit and withdraw.  I've experienced PartyPoker, PokerStars, 888 etc, none of them are easy to setup depost /withdraw.... Lots of forms, lots of waiting, lots of additional confirmations.  Bitcoin is a pay and go. Withdraw and go.  It's quick and easy, and doesn't require costly processing fees.    
    
Community fundraisers or any public gathering of finances... What's better than 100% transparency?
     
Multi sig -  Self explanatory.

Why would it be too late?  I look at the latter.  You need to let it run it's course and market Bitcoin for it's benefits as they appear.  There's already a few, but Bitcoin and the block chain will help push innovation in many directions with time, and each innovation will offer different value to different people.     
  
You can't just give a random 50 year old Bitcoin and expect them to know what to do with it, let alone protect it from thieves or use it without losing it.  People work hard for their money and a strong majority still believes bank fees are worth the protection, until it's too late and your money is locked in an inaccessible account... when the innovations arrive or economical pressures around the world for an alternative, Bitcoin will find it's way into the hands of everyone.

I was watching a documentary about the growth of digital payments (Paypal and shit) in the early days, how it started with negative / black market items and grew into the mainstream.

Really?  Interchange from the credit card companies is over 1%, I can't imagine a scenario where amazon pays less than the industry standard fee applied to every single business processing credit cards.  Here's a link that shows the current Visa and Mastercard interchange rates -      
   
I left the payment processing industry 2 months ago after a few years, I'm pretty familiar with it.  Retail processing and other card-present have lower rates, online has higher fraud therefore the network fees (interchange) are higher.     
  
Amazon is also an aggregator, they've built Amazon Payments.  This would help them get better rates as they process their own payments, but they still need to pay the standardized interchange fees, which for online transactions can get high.  This isn't incorporating MSP's fees, if Amazon was processing through paypal or another medium, they would be paying. 3.6% is a decent standard for online, there's lots of companies that charge upwards of that.

I am a very big optimist  for Bitcoin, it's benefits to merchants and consumers, and it's value in the context of long-distance / digital transactions.  Been in the payments industry for a while as well., merchant fees a pricey, but Bitcoin fees are encourching, they kill any B2C value in regards to reducing cost of transaction aboslrbed by the merchant or custy..    
  


    
I used to agree with your point... But everyday the tangible value in regards to "lower fees" isn't really true....  Perhaps in a B2B setting where you're transferring large volumes of currency - But when I started using Bitcoin, it was fractions of a penny for fees, which ment that B2C also worked, same with P2P... Now, if I want to send 5$ to you, or to a business, who absorbs the crazy fee?  Fees have been crazy, I just don't see it as a tangible benefit to be marketing anymore.   It doesn't hold the same actuality that if you said "bitcoin is to remove the reliance on 3rd party services" - that is 100% true.   The fee thing tho, I seem to defend myself too muchon that, cause low fees have been gone for long time.

Definitely an advantage for dropshippers and other businesses placing regular high volume orders.  You would be saving a shit ton on processing fees by any MSP or aggregator. CNP transaction, say you're using a mastercard, 3.6% on all orders, that can get expensive.  Bitcoin would significantly reduce this....   
   
I do think a huge key here is the trust factor, and this is where a low cost Bitcoin escrow service targeting retailer / wholesaler relationships would be awesome, because I can imagine that a number of businesses dealing with 00's of 000's or millions are skeptical of a Bitcoin transaction.... No guarantee that the person delivers, whereas a chargeback comes in handy for large international transactions, or at least some bed of security.   
   
I think if this problem was solved and businesses could trust the transaction at high volumes without a service taking a huge %, or somehow an automated escrow was in place, maybe it would gain popularity.

The truth.  I still don't think Bitcoin knows exactly what it is, and I am pretty sure in 5 years we will be looking at Bitcoin in a completely different context with all the innovation built upon the Bitcoin blockchain.     
       
I used to think Bitcoin was for B2C spending, I don't think that's where it adds value at the moment.   I don't necessarily think that Bitcoin will be a niche product in the future as some have noted on here, I do believe we're waiting on the innovation that will bring it to peoples hands...  Lacking right now - ease of use, onboarding new users and security of funds.  With time I believe these problems will be solved and B2C will use a platform built on the Bitcoin blockchain, B2B will do the same, other innovations will pop up to help the ease of use in these processes.... And Bitcoin will continue to be a store of value with greater potential as developments roll out.

There is PLENTY you just aren't seeking them.  The  tool that people use today would be the internet and a search engine to seek out information.  Seeking out information regarding cryptocurrency will point you quickly to the one that began it all, has an actual userbase, offers real world benefits and has the biggest collection of services, guides and content of ANY other alternative.

No need for convincing.  It seems like you enjoy the support, customer care, refund protection, and well the services offered by American Express, that's why they are who they are, and you should keep using them if they are meeting your standards!   
   
If you're looking for a transparent record of all global transactions, to manage your own finances without paying a service for support and infastructure, remit currency across boarders without hefty fees, shopping on Amazon once in a while for a discount, play poker or gamble online with greater access to fund and cheaper depositing / withdraws, micro lend/borrow with ease, store digital assets for the future, maintain your own financial security without paying traditional fees, accept digital payments as business without paying interchange rates (~3.6 % / transaction), sell something online without the risk of Paypal chargebacks, try Bitcoin!

Depending upon the project.  Most of the projects in this space are designed to take peoples money.  they create a problem opposed to solving a real world issue.

The crypto price doesn't matter.  If I want to send Bitcoin from a to b the price really doesn't matter to me.  I run P2P exchanging groups for slack and facebook, so transaction fees really don't exist.  You trade with people who want to buy or sell, you don't rely on a medium to locate them for you, then yes it is cheap.  Volatility exists absolutely.  This is a place where you need to learn to manage the risks yourself, as there is no bank to do it for you.   
  
Have you heard of BitPay?  BTCPay?  or any of the other 100000 services?  for 1% or less, your Bitcoin is converted at the spot price and deposited to your bank account.  Volatility risk 0.  1% far better than 5% to 10%. So if it can be done by the person, you can maintain using 0 services and removing volatility, it requires personal attention though.

People are trying things in every space to see what works, this isn't new to crypto, bitcoin or anything.  Innovation has been present in business since day 1.   
  
The fact that they FALSIFIED lawyer documents from a completely FAKE laywer is fraud, not trying to make a business work.  Falsifying receivables and changing actual numbers within users accounts is also FRAUD and it is certainly not trying to make a business work, why are you so apt to defend this?

I got super baked can you remind me and I will answer this tomorrow lol
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:06:20
Have you run a business?  Have you tried to accept credit cards online?  Do you know what merchants pay for card-not-present transactions?  Probably not, but if you researched it, and learned a little you would understand that online payments start at 3.5% from the majority of MSP's and 5% from aggregators.  You would also learn that number an go close to 10%.   
  
If you learned a little about bitcoin you would understand that merchants can reduce that digital transaction to 0%.  If you don't think generating 5%-10% more profit is important to a small, mid-sized or large business, well shit.  
   
That is one example.  Another would be the emerging cannabis industry and lack of digital processors to facilitate transactions as cannabis companies are deemed high risk by credit card networks.  Bitcoin is a very good use case in high risk industries.   
   
Would you like to keep going on the merchant side or move to the consumer side, or something different all together, I would love to help clear up your misconceptions and misunderstandings.
@_date: 2018-04-12 03:57:05

@_date: 2018-04-24 22:53:08


You literally have no idea what you are talking about. It's illegal for retailers to add rates.  You must be talking about the merchant account provider, or the aggregater -  Not the retailer.  And the 0.3% is interchange.  That is the fees you need to pay to use credit cards, there is other fees on top of that.  You don't process through Visa, you process through a merchant account provider, which in turn, charges more.     
   
I worked for 2 years at a credit card processing company, I understand the industry decently well. I am here for realistic discussion, not this extreme one way or the other BS that thrives here.
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:18:39
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:31:24
I feel like I am being rude... But it's simply realistic and factual what I am saying.  There is too many people pumping cryptocoins with an underlying goal to make money, not to add value to anyone or any situation.  I am not cool with that and gunna call out any shitcoin I have the opportunity to.
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:49:30
Well you seem to be shifting concerns.  You keep returning to BityPay, which I used for 1 tiny quick example for those who wish to automatically convert into a bank account.   With or without BitPay it is still cheaper, and I am not to interested in BitPay's business model as I am discussing merchant fees.   
  
This discussion is literally about processing transaction digitally.   You are going into some rabbit hole about credit.  The only place credit has here is the fact that it's the priority for people spending online or digitally transacting money.  The comparison is on digital payments, nothing to do with banks or credit.  Simply transacting.  Which costs merchants an arm and leg with CNP transactions, and bitcoin would drop that significantly, no matter which way you shape it.

@_date: 2018-04-22 22:11:25
I actually don't think you understand merchant payments, or you haven't read what has been wrote in our discussion here.  The benefits are pretty straight forward, and you're free to have an opinion about "ponzi", but Bitcoin offers consumers, businesses and society quite a few benefits.  If those don't apply to you, that is cool, keep moving a long.  You will use Bitcoin in the back end of some of your future transactions, and I am sure you will form another opinion based on your unwillingness to learn, I guess one could reference stupidity.  It's funny, you seem to have an air tight opinion on something you don't understand... Nothing new here.   Oh and regarding the price, how is it downwards when we got here around $10.  1000% increase as of today, must be a lost cause... lol.  Go cry in the corner alone.

Meh, Bitcoin is comprised of 90% peices of shit seeking to get rich.  Think about it.  The people here think deeper into finances than the average joe.  There is a good tiny portion who are here for innovation, there's a few more here to empower people and bring the innovation to people, but the vast majority want to get rich quick, fuck you over and spend your money on personal benefit, just the way this shitty as place is.  Roger Ver is one of those shitty people, represented by 000's of accounts across social networks.  I honestly think that there's about 1000 people in here with 100 accounts min each to pump their own tires.    
   
Personal, fucking, gain.  You cant trust these people... That is the people in r/bitcoin, OR, r/btc.  99.9% of the posts in both these subs are aimed at manipulating perceptions.

The MERCHANT pays these fees, not the consumer.  It is illegal for a merchant to charge fees for processing a credit card transaction.  When you goto use a credit card, and they charge you 25 cents, that is illegal.  The merchant pays the retailer, who pays the merchant account provider, who pays the network fees.

Haha, just posted this right after you =D Nice find!

You're actually an idiot.  I can't believe you spent so much time writing that having not read any of what the actual situation is.  God you're dumb.
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:24:35
There has to be some sort of on ramp for users, you can't just say fuck everything you know and expect excitement.  I see Bitcoin as a game changer to traditional financial systems, but all or nothing is a big plunge, perhaps Bitcoin is the on ramp for major change, but you surely don't have to be  100% only Bitcoin to participate in the ecosystem, that's just not going to work well ATM.

Good luck with your reading comprehension skills.

I actually agree with you on this one

This post offers quality to the 10% of people using Bitcoin who aren't pieces of shit.  Quality information, for quality people using Bitcoin, who want to integrate P2P tech into their lifestyle. If you have something wrong with it maybe you're in the wrong sub, isn't there an r/btc or something for ya
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:55:11
You're talking to the right person.  Banks are always going to be a service to the mainstream, anyone that says BTC replaces USD, or whatever extreme is wrong.  There is a time and a place and in certain situations Bitcoin offers value.  Clearly it's not the end all be all, but it definitely is useable, definitely has plenty of benefits  (whether they apply to your lifestyle or not).

I have a raging clue.   
   
Ingenico provides the terminal hardware &amp; software.  For usage, an MSP is required to connect a merchant account so a business can process transactions -  (send information to &amp; from the credit card brands, merchants bank and card holders bank during a transaction).
  
Without BitPay being an MSP, they basically have an agreement with the terminal providers... But each of those terminals is being used with a merchant account connecting to the actual processor ie. Elavon.   
Without an agreement with an MSP that has opened the doors to Bitcoin, I can see complications with how the merchant will actually switch to Bitcoin payments if BitPay is a separate entity from the MSP who gave the merchant account for the terminal.  
   
**I think that BitPay might be moving in the direction of becoming a registered MSP of a bank that is willing to turn the blind eye to Bitcoin or is alright with processing a high volume of Bitcoin conversions (if not already), in order to make the Bitcoin option available for actual use on Ingenico terminals, unless there is another partnership with an MSP that will allow vendors to use the Bitcoin option through BitPay**  
   
But after writing that, it would be awesome to see BitPay become an MSP and work hard to acquire merchants, processing fiat, with an always available option to transact in Bitcoin.... Perhaps that is something that has to do with the Ingenico agreement, adding a category to the settings menu to adjust Bitcoin payment settings?

You can shape your scenario how ever you wish.  Currently credit cards are the most frequently used means of transacting online.   Debit cards are not and cannot without a credit card network to piggy back off.  So in that context, yes Bitcoin will allow you to transact with digital payments for FAR cheaper as a merchant.    
  
Where are you going with this?
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:07:09
Got it too.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:48:16
I look at BTC as a benefit to consumers and merchants.  It adds value to certain purchasing situations.  It would be dumb for someone to try and use paypal in retail.  Or use cash on Amazon.  But as these have benefits, so does Bitcoin.  Merchants accepting digital payments at 0% instead of 5% plus for CNP transactions, 5% is a big number sometimes.
   
  
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:21:12
Thanks for the reply. I will look more into it!
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:41:51
Bitcoin for micro transactions is a thing of the past.  Bitcoin adds no value here other than removing chargebacks from the situation, which is a system designed to protect the consumer.

90% of startups fail.  10% succession rate doesn't sounds like risk adverse to me, try again.    
    


    
   
Are you on crack?  So when you decide you want to accept Bitcoin, the infastructure is just there?  The customers start pouring in right, and your employees just, accept it cause they know how to right?  Wrong.  This is how business owners try to accept Bitcoin, with false *bullshit* statements like yours with no grounding, then they get fucked.  Of course there is training costs associated with accepting Bitcoin.  The Bitcoin secure themselves right?  Then transfer themselves to the merchant account? There is education costs for your employees and customers.  You need to integrate Bitcoin with your traditional payments, and account for it, how much for an accountant that works with Bitcoin, probably more than traditional services... If you think there is no cost associated with it, **you're spreading misinformation**


   
Education would suggest you're spreading the truth, which isnt the case -  You are someone on the outside looking in who has probably never run a business before, and thinks it's a bunch easier and cheaper than it is.  There is costs associated with it.  There are *definite* benefits, but if you don't know what they are, you're doing Bitcoin no good by spreading bullshit.

Nah man.  It's greasy AF. People shouldn't have to do this.
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:20:15
Thanks for that.  I was in the CC processing industry for a while, and it was funny how insecure the old cards are.  The EMV rollout (in the US at least) was and still is a nightmare.  Was wondering if their was an insecurity if it was all for nothing, perhaps a terminal update is all they need to stay on top?      
   
Thanks for taking the time to write that!
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:06:52
Bitcoin is good for merchants yes,  but not in 99% of the ways promoted in this sub, they are un-realistic and flat out false.       
Why do you believe Bitcoin is an asset for merchants, and what value does accepting Bitcoin bring a business in your eyes?
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:20:24
Used it?  Easy and everything?  Question, say you have Bitcoin on your Trezor and there was a fork or something, all good still?
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:39:23
You're confused on this process.  I strongly suggest you consider the total picture before continuing to spread propaganda that will not hold true to a merchant.
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:56:09
I have never had an account in a bank, on a bitcoin exchange, in a bitcoin or online wallet of any sort, or anywhere (even a fucking credit card) that *starts* charging you once you are *done* using their services.  That is just greasy AF.
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:18:01
I'm not arguing with you.  I am however pointing out aspects of accepting Bitcoin in a business, that no matter how *you* would like to look at them, are 100% factual.  If you fail to see these costs, or implications, I am 100% questioning your history, as anyone who has accepted Bitcoin in their business *know* there are costs associated.
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:06:55
Wonderful explanation, I appreciate that, thanks.  I wonder why CC networks would use SHA-1 in the first place, it's kind of weird... They seem to almost encourage network insecurities as a way to justify extra compliance fees and increased rates... Nasty system it is.

K sweet, thanks a bunch!
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:19:32
This is exactly what I am talking about.  Put yourself in the shoes of a *real* business right now.  Not *someone elses*, pretend you're really running a business and hear about this Bitcoin thing - A business is not opening the doors unless change adds value.  Tangible value.  Not "becuase bitcoin" -  Where's the real value behind WHY a business would incur the costs associated with incorporating Bitcoin for long run benefit.  
  
Change requires education, training for employees, new practices for your business completely.  And you're going to tell me, that  "the easiest way to acquire Bitcoin for merchants and has zero chargeback risk" -  That's an LOL at best. It surely tells me you've never ran a business, but it really makes me laugh, your chargeback statement is merely regurgitating what I said.  C'mon kid, if you're going to promote Bitcoin to a specific market you better know what to say, especially if you're going to run around and suggest ways to improve someone's business, you best be sure....   Let's hear some more.
