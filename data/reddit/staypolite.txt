Cringe post of the day. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:40:57
Good luck taking open bazaar offline. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:07:18
Do a search you dumbass. Stop making a fool of yourself!
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:30:10
Sure you are. 
Everyone here is buying apparantly. Every day. All day long. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:50:03
Good boy. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 02:46:24
How often has this happened in 6 years? 
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:32:37
It's not about the price, right?
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:37:14
So one of bitcoins biggest selling points, the confirmation security, should be ignored because they also took the risk with cc's. 
Hi, i have this superior product that is safer than cc's but i don't recommend using that feature. Just take the risk because you also did when accepting cc's. 
Makes sense. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:07:35
Us? So does the tipping cult have a cute name yet? How about The Coinies?
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:29:02
Get a job. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:21:18
I can't make it any more simple for you to understand. Ask your mommy to explain it to you. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:10:01
It's just some of the crap people make up when the price goes down. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:39:58
You're a bit slow, aren't you?
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:08:12
When you're 16 maybe. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:20:31
Yes we get it. Everyone here is buying all they can at these amazing prices. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 12:21:31
Just like the early internet. That nobody wanted to use, had its peak after a few years and then died out. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:16:54
Exactly. Ridiculous article written by a Bitcoin cultist. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 03:58:04
I cringe so hard every time someone posts this. I've seen it posted at least 50 times here and always we're at a different phase the op just made up. So today we are at fight you again? Can't wait to see what it is next week. 
Oh and Gandhi never said this you dork. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 23:29:25
I wish that idiot would stop spamming them with pennies. It just makes it worse. Doesn't this guy really don't understand that?
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:20:24
You doubt many have done that. 
You know people are getting desperate when they start lying.  
@_date: 2014-11-07 03:43:46
We are anti government and they should stay away from Bitcoin right?
Unless you got scammed then you demand their help. 
Ok, noted. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 19:51:54
Person 462 who asks if we can look into the future. 
Look, if you need to ask random kids on a Reddit sub what to do with your money i suggest keeping it in your pocket. People like you always end up losing their money. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:32:02
Overstock did like a million in 2 months or so? We're seeing millions and millions being dumped. So no, your theory is wrong. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 11:29:45
Stop giving money to that idiot. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 11:27:51
Who the hell are you telling other people not to use alt coins. Warning for scams, fine. But if someone wants to use litecoin how is that your business. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 13:35:21
No. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 15:43:03
Well done. The irony is thick in this one. 
"Like Chris Duane, someone, or something, is scared. Very scared. And they have created an army." 
Posts like this and cultists like you are exactly the reason why Buttcoin exists. 
They aren't afraid. They aren't paid shills. They are just random people, even Bitcoiners who make fun of the ridiculous stuff that goes on here. 
I own many coins and there isn't a day here where i don't cringe reading what the cultists come up this time. Just like your post about them being very scared made me cringe. 
You people are so delusional. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 12:37:14
Because he is full of shit. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 23:23:32
The stuff i read here gets more retarded by the day. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:15:08
No i'm not anti Bitcoin. I own many coins. 
That's the problem with delusional people like you. Someone who doesn't share the Bitcoin fantasy land right away is anti Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:18:08
I don't want your pennies, believe me. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:05:58
Good vibes my ass. We all know there is 1 reason this is happening. Because these kids think spamming everyone with 2 cents will make them rich soon. It reminds me of Doge in its first months. Just worse. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:19:54
Affect. 
And how the hell is anybody here supposed to know what the price will do exactly?
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:29:00
"and the response will be bullish for gold, silver and bitcoin"
Because you hope so it instantly turns into a fact?
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:48:48
And then you woke up. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:25:33
Wrong sub. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:54:03
Everyone got out already. The gold rush is over. The only people left are suckers like your friend who'll end up losing money. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 09:29:17
Lose not loose. 
And those crazy shills what you mean with that exactly? 
@_date: 2014-11-01 09:53:23
For some reason i think you only made this post because you are aren't part of this rich list. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 21:27:10
So no argument where i'm wrong? 
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:08:06
Yes there is. In the upcoming Maryland case. It's been posted over and over again in pretty much every thread about Ross here. 
The problem is your fellow druggies keep crying how all the charges were dropped, which is a lie. But for some reason you guys suffer reading problems when it comes to the charges. The lies get blindly repeated and the facts ignored. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:51:22
No. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 12:41:12
10 bits. Seriously?
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:23:27
Most people here are shitting their pants but they won't tell you ofcourse. Instead it's post after post how there is nothing wrong. 
Denial. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:25:24
Buttcoin troll? Not once have i posted there. 
Paranoid much?
@_date: 2014-11-01 01:07:07
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:10:52
Oh right. I almost thought it was just Bitcoin. Nothing to worry about then. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:32:28
I have a feeling there might be more to the story than you're telling. 
Which is not uncommon on this sub. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:48:03
Oooh i get it. I have to replace the internet with Bitcoin and those guys are evil bankers, right?
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:24:55
What the fuck are you talking about?  
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:33:47
He's not being charged with murder for hire! Iiiinnooocent!
Oh shit he is being charged with murder for hire. Uh errr not relevant! Iiinnnooocent!
Don't worry. All you druggy buddies did exactly the same thing in previous posts. So you're not the only one looking stupid. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:14:45
No. There is no logic in "if you don't like it when someone spams, you should do it better". 
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:15:40
Half the sub is. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 12:31:31
Your bs is getting more ridiculous with every post. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 11:55:20
This place is absolutely filled with drug users who will downvote anything and anyone that criticizes their drug/Bitcoin utopia to oblivion. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:01:38
I am. By not filling up threads with Satoshi spam. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:33:37
Let's just ignore everything else i said and act like it's only about buying cars. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 12:29:55
Good argument. I'm convinced!
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:03:00
Wrong. He's being charged for hiring a hitman so i'd say he most likely did. But we'll see. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:38:12
Bitcoin is going down, gold is going down so it has to be related and Bitcoin is being treated as gold. 
Am i really reading this right?
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:58:07
Well if he didn't try to a hire a hitman like Ross then why would they. They probably already have enough to lock him up for life. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:20:57
Can't you read?
"Of the six murder indictments trumpeted by the U.S. government in the days following Ulbricht’s Oct. 2013 arrest, five have fallen off the table and the sixth sits untouched in a separate indictment (legalese for an unproven allegation) that was purposefully left out of the upcoming trial. "
Also that last part is ridiculous. "that was purposefully left out of the upcoming trial" yeah no shit, it's another case in another state. Of course it was left out. 
Most likely written by one of your fellow druggies. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:14:49
How do you know?
Edit: Hilarious i got downvoted for asking this. Like it's some kind of fact and any person asking why must be eliminated. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:11:00
irrelevant or unsolicited messages sent over the Internet, typically to large numbers of users, for the purposes of advertising, phishing, spreading malware, etc.
unwanted or intrusive advertising on the Internet.
a tinned meat product made mainly from ham.
send the same message indiscriminately to (a large numbers of Internet users).
Just because you like it doesn't mean it's not spam. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:20:46
They are not known for having 1% of all coins. Who told you that?
@_date: 2014-11-04 09:16:55
You have no clue how Google works, do you?
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:49:58
Looking at the way you type i'd say 15. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:14:56
I'm aware of that and that's where it will go wrong. Waiting up to a hour for a house. Sure. 
An expensive car, sure. A normal car, no. Yet the store owner is gonna want 1 confirmation for cheap cars. For tv's. For electronics worth 1000+. For tons of things. 1000's of normal every day transactions are gonna need 1 confirmation. This is not gonna work. 
As i asked before, if you downvote then at least tell me where i'm wrong. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 23:47:07
Imagine getting a 2 cents "tip" that is worth just 1 cent by next week. I'm sure that will convert those who hate Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:40:24
Such an amazing feature of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:31:38
Could your gut feeling be influenced by the fact that you own coins and want the price to go up?
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:13:18
Why is this always the standard reply? 
My transaction took 30 mins to confirm. Well that's fine because credit cards can be reversed 3 weeks later.
Really, it's always the same reply. How exactly is that relevant?
@_date: 2014-11-05 14:38:36
Ffs stop harrassing all these people! You people are more annoying than those who knock on my door on sundays. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 10:04:22
It's not free bits. You worked a week for it. 
It is truly beyond me people waste so much of their time for pennies. Can't you get a real job?
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:55:55
When we go down the price suddenly isn't important anymore. Funny how that works. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:05:08
If that's funny and totally wrong then you should take a moment to wonder why people think you are 15 and do something about it. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:10:28
Do a search man. This question is asked daily. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:37:44
You look more butt hurt than they do. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 01:27:58
How are they gonna prove i didn't forget it?
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:20:23
A dollar outside this sub. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:18:49
About 0. 
Everyone who invested in Bitcoin this year lost money. 
There are tons of better things out there to invest in and actually make money with. 
Ah, downvoted because you are not allowed to say you shouldn't invest in Bitcoin. 
This place is a riot. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:11:53
No thanks. I prefer not to take money from other people. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 23:13:29
You can't be serious. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:37:17
What makes you think Bitcoin is part of this and on the same level as gold and silver. Get out of fantasy land man. 
Why is it so rare to see a Bitcoin supporter here who isn't completely delusional. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:57:43
Ross is iiiiinnoooooocent!!!
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:28:24
Let me guess. This is gonna be another "we don't give a shit but let's post 20 times a day about it" situation like Apple pay. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:00:50
If you can't see it in the first place i doubt an explanation will help you. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:34:01
Yes. Sell everything you got! Quick quick!
@_date: 2014-11-04 08:04:16
Cringe post of the day. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 22:42:57
So i was right. Why does everyone give me shit then? Because reality is not allowed here?
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:40:29
This whole article is based on a believe "that bitcoin is the proverbial comet that is about to disrupt his business."
Nothing else. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:48:37
How old are you?
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:55:28
You'll get downvoted. You're supposed to say that the bankers are shaking in fear. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:57:50
You can stop tipping me. I don't want your pennies. Save your energy. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:49:18
At a store i can buy something instantly with my bank card. With Bitcoin i might have to wait for a hour. 
You can downvote this all you want because you hate reality but it won't make it go away. 
And yes i am a big Bitcoin supporter but the confirmation times are a big problem if Bitcoin ever goes mainstream. 
Edit: and downvoted of course but without telling me where i'm wrong. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:49:47
Wrong sub. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 02:13:49
I feel bad for all these people who are gonna get spammed with 2 cents. I cringe just thinking about it. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:03:04
So still you won't point out where i'm wrong? How odd. I wonder why. 
And i haven't ignored any of your points because you have not posted anything relevant to mine. So stop talking out of your ass. 
Look back to what you wrote. Actually don't bother. I won't be responding to you anymore anyway. You cultists live in a fantasy world and will ne er admit any flaws. You either ignore it or downvote the person mentioning it till it goes away. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:53:26
None of this is a fact so stop pretending it is. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:59:32
Of course you are skeptical. 
You love drugs and Bitcoin. Ross sold drugs through Bitcoin. 
He is your hero and your hero is innocent by default. 
Funny how that works eh?
But hey don't let facts, reality and critical thinking get in your way. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 10:18:49
Haha no they're not. Don't be silly. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:10:11
Wrong sub. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:36:57
Below 1 dollar.
Good luck explaining that to the kids here. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 23:47:27
Jesus dude stop it. I'm talking about the customer, you still don't see that? The customer doesn't give a shit about all that and certainly don't want to wait a hour after buying a tv. 
Now read and think before you reply again. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:09:53
How old are you?
@_date: 2014-11-02 20:36:08
BITCOIN USER NOT AFFECTED FAP FAP FAP!!11!
That's the point of this post right?
@_date: 2014-11-02 13:49:39
It's insulting. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:58:57
What entities and why would they do that?
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:54:20
The crystal ball told you so?
@_date: 2014-11-07 02:34:27
Facts = FUD?
So any article that isn't 100% in Bitcoin's favor now needs a FUD tag?
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:37:24
Amazing logic. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 01:39:32
Right, because only someone who is Redditor for a long time can own many coins. 
The stupidity in this sub is just crazy. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 15:36:21
No. Use some common sense. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:32:03
I honestly don't see any fud being posted. What are you talking about?
Edit: why am i being downvoted to oblivion exactly?
@_date: 2014-11-03 00:24:15
Still not banned? You're getting real annoying. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:54:49
This sub has turned into a kids playground like Dogecoin. 
It's nothing more that spamming cents in hopes of getting rich soon. 
It will soon fade once the short lived hype is over. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:35:16
That's what they also said at 800. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:26:17
If Bitcoin would go mainstream that means tons of store owners are gonna want 1 confirmation for certain products. We're easily talking 1000's of transactions a day where the customer is gonna have to wait up to one hour. I don't think i have to explain how that's not gonna work. 
Anyway it's hard to argue with someone who's logic is "i once bought something and it was instant so you are a troll".
Edit: can any of the downvoters also tell me where i'm wrong?
@_date: 2014-11-03 01:20:28
If i would be forced to give up my private keys i'd tell em i lost the password to my wallet. What are they gonna do about it?
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:54:04
Damn, you are annoying. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:04:38
Yes. It turned into a children's playground worse than the Doge sub. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:17:05
The Bitcoin "investors" are mostly broke kids who hope to get rich off 2 coins without working. 
Edit: downvoting will not make this fact go away. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 12:33:49
A 1 year market correction. You're a funny guy. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:59:33
These posts are getting more retarded by the day. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:50:13
I have a serious question for you. Doesn't it bother you that you type like a 13 year old and act like a 15 year old? I just don't understand your behavior. Don't you want people to treat you as an adult instead?
Really, just at least try to type as if you've been to school a couple of years. It will greatly improve your quality of life. 
Also stop typing lol in every reply and people might actually believe you're not 15. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 01:11:42
It's impossible to discuss this subject because it's either ignored or downvoted. Just like any post that talks about Bitcoin's flaws. And that is also what you are doing. 
Nobody has proven me wrong yet in this thread. Yet everyone gives me shit and downvotes me. Typical Bitcoin cultist behavior. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 16:19:41
No. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:32:24
"All of these are on sale. It's the buying opportunity of a lifetime."
So was 800 remember? And 600. 
Anyway, i assume you sold everything you have and took a 100k loan to invest in the once in a lifetime oppertunity? If no, why not?
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:51:12
You're not tipping these people 2 cents i hope?
@_date: 2014-11-02 15:56:23
Find you examples?
Next i have to show you grass is green?
@_date: 2014-11-02 18:36:28
I cringe every time you "tip" someone 2 cents. 
It's insulting, worthless, useless and a waste of time and energy.
