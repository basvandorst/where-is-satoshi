What you are suggesting is that it’s ok to hack someones BTC funds in the future. Losing a key doesn’t equal losing property, people still legally own that BTC. You can’t just take it. And suggesting that losing funds in that case would be “your own fault”, would mean that BTC is not something ready for adoption since only people following (and understanding) the tech can safely use it. You are also suggesting that these hacks will be so common that they won’t influence price movement in the future.
As to the cost of cracking a private key: do we really know anything about the costs? No we don’t. It’s pure speculation. But if quantum computers would be extremely expensive to use, they wouldn’t be very useful for much anyway. On the other hand, remember that at this point you can use IBM’s quantum computer for free on their cloud on the IBM experience. And then the price of BTC in the next 5-10 years… Might be extremely lucrative to hack BTC addresses. I wouldn’t bet on the argument that hacking BTC wouldn’t be cost effective in the future.


You are confusing mining and hacking here. In the case of a hack, we are talking supply and demand. The supply would go up which drives the price down. Also the fact that a % of BTC is insecure will add to the trust mainstream users will have in BTC value, which isn’t a positive for the price either.


Implementing signature schemes isn’t a matter of copy pasting. You actually need to fully understand (be an expert) the signature scheme you implement or you risk the exact thing you want to improve: your security. For reference google the article "Seriously, stop using RSA"
In the case of RSA: this is a well accepted sig scheme, but has to be implemented perfectly. And if you don’t have specialized knowledge of the underlying math, you could set your implementation up for failure. 
Another reference for failure in understanding cryptography is IOTA implementing WOTS+. People actually lost funds there. After which they as users, got the blame for being “stupid”. Lol.
So for a safe and user friendly implementation, you’d need an expert for that particular signature scheme. 
As to the sig schemes mentioned in the paper, I’d prefer to point at NIST, which is in the process of approving a selection of signature schemes. Several of the sig schemes mentioned in the paper have already been dropped from the NIST selection. 
As to the level of difficulty: it is far from misleading to state it is difficult to implement quantum resistant sig schemes. Doing this without the help and review of an expert on the specific sig scheme would not be advisable. 


This will be the mother of all forks. Performance will be influenced by bigger signatures that come with QR sig schemes. Hardware for mining might need to be replaced. Two huge negatives which will initiate political battle for consensus. And there will only be a positive once the threat of quantum computers materialize (since that, and only that is what it protects BTC from). This fork will rather be postponed than quickly implemented. But then there is a time factor: because after the fork, all BTC is still on old, vulnerable addresses. All the fork does, is give one the option to migrate coins to new quantum resistant addresses. So for a quantum resistant circulating supply, BTC depends on the action of over 7 million users. And by that time that might be a multiple of that number. Which also means that for the value of your personal BTC, you depend on the actions of millions of people. Most importantly: this takes time, no way this will be done overnight, or within months. And then we still have the “lost coins”.
Yeah, this will be a super positive experience for BTC.

That's an interesting point of view, how so?
@_date: 2019-07-14 07:39:00


How would one distinguish long term holders from lost addresses? Just the fact they stay stagnant after the option to migrate towards quantum resistant addresses doesn't mean the owners lost their keys. Simply means they haven't moved them yet.
And even if all lost addresses (about 20% estimated to be lost of all BTC) would be legally fair game, then I don't see how bringing them back into circulation is a positive for BTC. Supply would just go up with 20%.. Not a positive for the price.
And since there is no drop in replacement for current cryptography, where did you get the idea that implementing quantum resistant cryptography is not difficult?
@_date: 2018-10-07 16:10:45
Moving to new addresses isn't enough. See attack 3 on page 8 of this paper:  
BTC needs post quantum cryptography.
And integrating quantum resistant cryptography comes with the problem that all criculating supply will need to be transfered to new quantum proof addresses to make sure all 100% of circulating supply is protected and quantum resistant. The Satoshi addresses, are unaccessible and therefore can't be moved. There will be other "lost addresses" BTC has been around for a while. Also you need to consider human nature. Not all current users will move their funds.
@_date: 2018-10-09 18:45:30
He means it's not sha256 that will be cracked. That's why nobody worries about it. It's ECDSA that will be cracked. So your public- private key pairs are at risk then. 
Also: a big difference is that banks use centralized systems. So they can change cryptography or hashing functions overnight if they feel like it. None of the users would notice because it would happen out of sight.
Blockchain is decentralized. It needs consensus amongst miners, but more importantly, all users need to take action after a change in cryptography because their key pairs can't be switched for them. You might know that if you lose your private key, it's not like you can click on "forgot my password". They can't send you a new key pair, like some website can send you a new password. In the same way that they can't change your old ECDSA key pair into a new quantum resistant key pair and send you that by email. It's just not how blockchain functions. It's exactly that what everybody loves about it. But in this case it's a weakness. No airthight solution has been found besides building a new blockchain from scratch and launch with quantum resistant qualities from genesis block. 
So whenever people say "Well banks and websites will have the same problem." They don't understand what the problem for blockchain is.

True, good point.


You might want to edit this other comment you made about this solution then:


As you say, this option is only useful for a very specific use case. And quite likely, if you own a 100 BTC, you would transfer to a QR address right away after the implementation of QR addresses. So you wouldn't need this option. Unless in the case of a sudden speed up in the development of quantum computers and BTC is too late. In that case you would need to wait for a QR solution first, see the price drop because a non QR-BTC is useless in that period and then, after that is implemented you could use this option and wait six month. While all that time lost addresses are vulnerable for quantum attacks with no possible solution to make sure they don't get stolen and sold making the price drop even more, not to mention the market reaction to all the above events. Not sure what that 100 BTC would be worth by then. Quantum computing will break BTC. (And many other non-QR projects running now.)
Just out of curiosity, one more thing, because you might know the answer to this question: How would you design the new SF rules that delay transactions in such a way that you would still be able to normally make transactions for QR addresses to QR addresses without delaying them too?
PS: I don’t know how these sort of things add to the discussion, but you wrote in multiple comments about this option too, but I guess that’s all right? Just don't be surprised if I react to both, and don't be surprised if some of the mentioned arguments in these reactions are the same.

Yeah, either I point out what I refer to, or you read the whole paper and react to something completely different. 


You describing a broken blockchain. WHen quantum computers form a threat, a blockchain either works safely without any workarounds, or it won't be used.

That's interesting. How would that work? Could you explain, or refer to some article, project or paper?

And after you stashed your funds on a new unused address, never spend your funds either. See attack 3 on page 8 of this paper: 
@_date: 2018-10-09 19:41:53
What happened to rule number 3? "n" blocks locked funds? Applying step 1 and 2 without step 3, the delay fase as protection against accidental and adversarial chain reorganisations isn't a safe method. In the following paper they propose a non-spendable period of 6 months. Not sure what you propose but if it’s 6 months, then why even mentioning this method... See paper here 
And even with the proper delay fase included, then still it would not be safe due to MITM attacks where the pubkey can be hijacked in the traject before the commit transaction reaches the nodes.
@_date: 2018-10-09 18:52:04
Hello mr. "n" blocks locked down funds ;)
Waiting for the solution and the actual solution itself are two totally different things. One is a joke, the other is interesting.
Not spending your funds until a solution is in place is not a solution. Expecting people not to spent their money and being ok with that while it's a payment system is a joke.
Being able to proof you knew the key before the attacker did, is what’s interesting. 
That being said: unfortunately what you propose is not a solution either. If you want to make BTC quantum resistant in this way,  the downsides are huge. From the user experience point of view, it slows down transactions "n" times and besides that, this solution doesn't prevent risking MITM attacks during the moment where the transaction is sent to the nodes. Also a hard fork needs consensus. I doubt this one will reach consensus.

Quantum computers have the potential to perform certain calculations significantly faster than any normal computer. Also quantum computers can run certain algorithms that could be used to make calculations that can crack cryptography used today.  and  
Most blockchains use Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) cryptography. Using a quantum computer, Shor's algorithm can be used to break ECDSA. (See for reference:  and pdf:  ) Meaning: they can derive the private key from the public key. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 18:57:00
As you mention yourself, rule 1 and 2 don’t prevent hijacking after a transaction is submitted to the network for processing. You would need rule 3 for that. But rule 3 implies effectively that your funds is locked for a certain period, which makes transactions from a users perspective a lot slower. 
Also, if you implement this as a quantum resistant solution, you would obviously need to be 100% sure “n” is a number that is to be enough to make sure the forged transaction isn’t confirmed before the original. So the extra time "n" blocks will take, could be a while if you want to guarantee security of transactions in a realistic ecosystem. But even if you take n = 1, which would probably not be enough, you would double BTC’s block time. While we try to make transactions faster, you propose to slow them down. There are already quantum resistant blockchains available which do a better job right now. Mochimo and QRL. Going quantum resistant means you need to step up your game. 
Any "solution" that needs to temporary lock up funds, or will not be able to protect the full circulating supply, or will need to burn a percentage of the circulating supply without being able to determine with 100% certainty that what is burned is actually lost instead of not moved to safe address yet for some reason, is a terrible scenario from the user perspective.
And the worst part is that this solution is not even a 100% secure solution. Before a transaction reaches a node, MITM attacks are a very real threat. A pubkey could be hijacked in that traject and the original transaction can be slowed down or stopped all together from reaching any node. There would be no way for a the blockchain to know they are dealing with a forged transaction because the hijack happened outside the network before anything can be registered.
Edit - If the locked funds for "n" blocks period is 6 months like in [this]( proposal I don't think it's a solution at all. More a last resort to rescue funds from a sinking ship.

The option he mentions is not for dayly based transactions. It's only for a very specific usecase: for moving BTC from a non-quantum resistant address to a quantum resistant address in a time where quantum computers actually fomr a threat, while BTC itself is already quantum resistant. (If they manage to become quantum resistant at all.)
The attack that the paper describes is on transactions when BTC isn't quantum resistant. And the option this guy mentions is only usefull when BTC is quantum resistant.
So the answer to your question is: it doesn't.
@_date: 2018-10-07 16:07:35
No need to break any hash function. It's about breaking ECDSA cryptography, see attack 3 on page 8 of this paper: 
3,000 Error corrected Qubits for ECDSA (secp256k1 in Bitcoin) are required to extract private keys from public keys or a Quantum Simulator (a more specialised Quantum Computer) that can do that using shors algorithm.
Also, as you can read in many answers given here, the fact that BTC only publishes the original public key is a false sense of security. Satishi addresses are on original pub keys address, addresses from before 2012 are on original pub key addresses and many people re-use addresses. A huge % of circulating supply is vulnerable for quantum attacks.
@_date: 2019-10-05 15:52:28




Not exactly. Forking the chain only changes the sig scheme. Not the current addresses. These are all still accessible through the old (quantum vulnerable) private- pub keys. So forking is just the beginning. After that, migration of all circulating supply must begin and fulfilled. This can only be done by the owners since only they have the private key. The quantum resistance of BTC will depend on the proactive attitude of millions of BTC owners. 
And all the addresses that are lost (from which no one has the private key which is about 20% of all BTC) can't be migrated. Chainalysis concluded that between 17% (low estimate) and 23% (high estimate) of BTC is lost. The big discrepancy between the high and low estimate (1 mill BTC) shows the issues there will be to determine with certainty what stagnant addresses are lost and what are long term holders. You can’t just one-sided decide to vaporize someone’s funds.
This is always portrayed as easy, but that's a simplification that is not correct. If done right, it's a long process.

@_date: 2019-10-05 15:58:48
That vid is full of flaws and weird assumptions. 
- Assuming nuke codes won't be protected by quantum resistant cryptography while the NSA is advising since 2015 to move towards QR cryptography is just ignorant. Sorry to be blunt but come on. 
- He casually mentions at a certain point Satoshi's coins will move. And that then we know a QC exists. Like that won't cause a marketreaction. Besides the 1 mill Satoshi's coins, there is an estimate of 20% of lost coins. (+/- 3.5 mill) Calling that no issue, isn't realisitc. 
- In the second part he states that Satoshi's coins arent safe because they haven't moved and assumes that they are on hashed pubkey addresses. But he forgets that P2PKH was not implemented back then. The Satoshi coins are on full pubkey addresses and thus vulnerable to quantum hacks.
- He's also wrong about the P2PKH protection. Hashed public keys are no protection: It is often said that not reusing addresses would make BTC quantum resistant, which is not true, fully explained in the article "Quantum resistant blockchain and cryptocurrency, the full analysis in seven parts. Part 6."
When a transaction is sent to the nodes, the public key is revealed and it can be MITM-ed before it is received by the nodes. Also when it waits in the pool the pubkey can be obtained before the tx is confirmed and a forged tx can be prioritized using high fees. And the third window of opportunity: transactions can be hijacked during blocktime.
- And the last mistakte: Mentioning not all coins are vulnerable does only mean that those coins can't be stolen, but it does not mean that after a hack of other coins, the decrease in value doesn't affect the "safe" coins. Because all coins will dump in value due to a hack.
Lately, Pieter Wuille, BTC dev, acknowledged that hashed public keys are no protection for BTC value. See his thoughts on the subject on twitter, and in this very thread.
This is also acknowledged by Andrew Poelstra in the whatbitcoindid interview. "Andrew Poelstra on Schnorr, Taproot &amp; Graft Root Coming to Bitcoin" (40:00 and further) He even goes as far as explaining how public keys are exposed in several other ways besides sending transactions to such an extent that “basically all the public keys are exposed.” “If everybody else bitcoins are lost, then […] you have retained all these tokens that are worthless.” Which is an acknowledgment of the risk of value decline due to hacks of the percentage of BTC that is not on addresses with hashed public keys?
44:00 “It was never intended as quantum protection. It doesn’t function as quantum protection. There’s sort of this idea out there that it does, but it doesn’t. And even if it did, by the way, it’s very unclear how you would spend your coins again, because you have to reveal the public key to spend the coins.”

Not correct. IOTA is quantum resistant because they use a quantum resistant signture scheme: WOTS. The private keys in WOTS can only be used once because after that they become unsafe. IOTA messed up there because they let users reuse addresses and people got hacked. So yeah, don't use IOTA addresses twice or they can be hacked even with todays computers. [See here also about another issue they had with WOTS](
So not the same. And BTC is not quantum resistant as long as you don't reuse addresses. [See here](
QRL uses XMSS, which also uses WOTS, only then in such a way that you can reuse addresses. QRL is the only quality project right now as far as quantum resistance goes in blockchain. They already launched and are quantum resistant from genesis block which makes that they don't have issues with lost addresses etc.

IOTA uses WOTS as a quantum resistant signature scheme. Can't reuse addresses. Which is a quality you need if you want adoption. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:50:42
Yeah after Trinity launched, wallets prevent the **user** to reuse addresses. But not my **custommers** who obviously don't know if and when I made a transfer from my address. Using IOTA I need to change my address constantly. But if I have a company, or I rent out houses, or any business with reoccurring payments from the same custommers, IOTA is not for me. 
But even if I don't have much reoccurring payments and I have new custommers all the time, I want an address like a payment account on my website that I don't have to change every second I make a transfer. Which is what I need to do as soon as I have spent funds. Because from that time my old address isn't safe anymore. So that means I can't receive payments on that address anymore. 
You seen bars, restaurants and stores that accept crypto? With the address on the wall? Like a BTC qr scan? Not gonna happen for IOTA, because you would be pasting new stickers for every customer.
Besides that, how am I going to send invoices? I don't know when customers will pay after they received the invoice, but in the mean time I like to be able to make transfers. The problem is, if I make a transfer, this would make the address unsafe and thus unusable in a safe way. That means that if I sent invoices with the same address, I need to wait untill everyone has payed and no more new deposits will be made on that address. Only then i can spend funds from that address. But I don't want to wait untill all my custommers have payed, because I run a business and I have bills to pay myself. So I need to create a new address for every invoice I send because otherwise either I can't spend my IOTA from that address, or the payment will be done on a vulnerable address. 
So no, IOTA hasn't figured out how to prevent reusing addresses. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 12:21:12
What you say is incorrect. How can you get to that conclusion after reading my response above? It explains how and when your public key is public during a transaction and that your public key can be obtained by a hacker during that period. 
That goes for any transaction. So for transactions from an unused address or a reused address. Both transactions can be hijacked during the transaction. **Because as soon as you send a transaction, your public key is published and since your transaction is not confirmed instantly there is a window in which your transaction can be hijacked.** When that window is, is summed up in my previous response. The only advantage of not reusing your addresses is that as long as you don't make a transation, your pubkey is not public and thus you're safe as long as you never spend your funds. But you want to make a transaction sometime right? Or your BTC is useless. So during that transaction you can be hacked.  
You don't even have to take my word for it, [this paper explains how hijacking works during blocktime](
@_date: 2019-01-16 15:38:28
What you describe is a hard fork where the chain is split and everyone needs to apply to get the QR BTC before the fork, or within some deadline. This is not a possibility if you want BTC to be quantum resistant. You would end up with BTC and with BTC QR. 
If BTC wants to go quantum resistant, they will need to change their signature scheme without splitting the chain. So monday you own 2 BTC, and tuesday you still own the same 2 BTC on the same chain. But now, if you make a transaction and send your BTC to a new address, that address has quantum resistant pub and private keys. That way your BTC would become quantum resistant. So for 100% of BTC to become quantum resistant all coins need to be moved to quantum resistant addreses. All lost addresses can't make that move because no one has acces and this noone can move them and thus a certain percentage of BTC will stay vulnerable. (About 20% of BTC is estimated to be on addresses that no one has access to. Satoshi funds is about 1 million BTC.) You can't just burn coins that are not being moved. Because there is no way to determine if those coins are lost, or owned by people who for some reason have not moved their coins yet. So "just make the lost addresses including the Satoshi funds unusable" is not an option.

So basically you say you don't mind BTC getting hacked just because you can see it comming. I think it will damage the brandname. And I think you could underestimate the amount. 
It's quite a lot of BTC that's still on old exposed addresses. (about 1.77 million BTC fall into this category) ( p. 7) This includes the Satoshi funds.
Besides older addresses (I think it's pre 2012 addresses that have P2PK UTXOs?), there are other ways people expose their public key. 
Pub keys get exposed by: 
- Reusing addresses. (Which is done often, even though not advised.)
- Bitcoin users publishing their public key on a Bitcoin fork, e.g. Bitcoin Cash [1] or Bitcoin Gold [2]. ( p. 7)
- Any other revealing of public keys, such as part of signed messages to ensure integrity, in forums, or in payment channels (e.g. Lightning Network [51]). ( p. 7)
[There is about 36% of all BTC stored on addresses with exposed pubkeys.](
[And about 20% is on lost addresses.](
And as to the common sentiment, I see a lot of FUD calling comming by in discussions about quantum computers vs Blockchain. The postst get mostly downvoted and comments that ridicule the issue getting upvoted most showing the sentiment on the subject. And the Wright paper about BTC vs QC's litteraly states "So don't listen to the FUD."

Yeah, because if there is a computer that can break ECDSA, that would be the argument not to worry. "Hey lots of other stuff they can do with that computer." 
It's not about your 1K of BTC on an address. It's about security and the value of BTC. Security is not "Yes it's possible, bit don't worry it won't happen." If BTC isn't able to protect it's circulating supply, there will be an effect on BTC value. Your amount of BTC will be safe, but it's value will drop due to marketreaction. And there is a decent amount of BTC on lost addresses like the Satoshi funds that will not be migrated to a quantum safe address after a QR update. (With full public key exposed) So BTC will never be able to protect all 100% of it's circulating supply.
Quantum resistant blockchains will be available as an alternative for blockchains who don't make the switch or won't be able to fully protect enough of it's circulating supply.
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:44:29
Don't know why you would point out other systems instead of looking for solutions for blockchain. But besides that, you're wrong. Banks and websites are centralized systems, they will face challenges, but decentralized systems like blockchain will face some extra challenges that won't apply for centralized systems. 
- Updating the signature scheme will need consensus in the sense that all nodes need to update after implementation of a quantum resistant signature scheme. 
- Users of blockchain will personally need to move their funds from old addresses to new quantum resistant addresses. You won't need to move your bank funds.
- Lost addresses where people lost access to their funds will never be moved and stay vulnerable to quantum hacks. Blockchain doesn't know their users, can't communicate with them and won't be able to distinguish coins on lost addresses from coins from users who still have access but somehow have not migrated their coins after a quantum resistant update. So burning lost coins will be legally a big issue.
All issues specific for blockchain and not for banks or websites or any other centralized system.

And yet a quantum computer can find the answer. Quantum computers have the potential to perform specific kinds of calculations significantly faster than any normal computer. Besides that, quantum computers can run algorithms that take fewer steps to get to an outcome, taking advantage of quantum phenomena like quantum entanglement and quantum superposition. So quantum computers can run these certain algorithms that could be used to make calculations that can crack cryptography used today.  and 
Most blockchains use Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) cryptography. Using a quantum computer, Shor's algorithm can be used to break ECDSA. (See for reference:  and pdf:  ) Meaning: they can derive the private key from the public key. So if they got your public key (and a quantum computer), then they got your private key and they can create a transaction and empty your wallet.
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:43:12
In the transaction you send, you include your public key. The public key is needed to check the signature. You can't authenticate a transaction without the public key. So there is no way around it. As soon as you send your transaction from your device, your public key is exposed on the internet. 
You can pretty much distinguish 3 moments on it's yourney to confirmation.
- On it's way over the internet from your device to the node(s) it's vulnerable to MITM attacks. At this point of time, that is no problem. There is no incentive to do so because all the info in your transaction is useless for a hacker. But as soon as a quantum computer can derive the private key from the public key, it's gold for hackers. 
- When it arrives at the nodes, it waits in the pool for a miner to add it to a to be mined block. The time it waits here depends on the network capacity vs the amount of transactions that is submitted. When it's overloaded, a transaction can be stuck for a bit untill it's picked to be added to a block. (For a bit or for quite some time, this is why transactions take long to be confirmed sometimes.)
- Once added to a block and the miner starts hashing, the blocktime starts out. Now that is 10 min. 
All this time a public key is published and can be obtained. A hijack during the last part, the blocktime, is explained in the first paper I added in the comment above.

Yeah, that's trying to figure it out, not have figured it out. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 11:48:47
Sorry but what you propose is incorrect. Because that transaction would be signed by a vulnerable key pair. Not a quantum resistant keypair. And thus the transaction can be hijacked as if there is no quantum resistant signature scheme implemented at all. (The quantum resistant signature scheme would only be effective for the next transaction.) Hijacking transaction is explained [in this paper]( on page 8, point 3. 
A solution that is proposed for migrating from quantum vulnerable addresses to quantum resistant addresses, after the point in time from where quantum computers form a threat, is the proof of knowledge option. [Paper here]( This would be an option that can be combined with what you propose. (Send from an old address and transfer all funds to a new quantum resistant address while that transaction is done by proof of knowledge.)  Only thing is, the proof of knowledge option is not a valid option since this includes a period of 6 months where the to be transfered funds need to be locked. As explained in the paper. BTC would be out of the game for six months, which as we know is an eternity in crypto.
The only option is switching signature schemes before quantum computers become a threat and then make sure all coins are migrated before the threat materializes. (Which is impossible for the lost addresses as said. No matter what option you choose.)

What you say is incorrect. 
In the transaction you send, you include your public key. The public key is needed to check the signature. As soon as you send your transaction from your device, your public key is exposed on the internet. Not only after confirmation. You can't authenticate a transaction without the public key. So there is no way around it. There is a big window of opportunity where your transaction can be hijacked. If you send from an unused address, or a reused address. 
You can pretty much distinguish 3 moments on it's yourney to confirmation.
- On it's way over the internet from your device to the node(s) it's vulnerable to MITM attacks. At this point of time, that is no problem. There is no incentive to do so because all the info in your transaction is useless for a hacker. But as soon as a quantum computer can derive the private key from the public key, it's gold for hackers. 
- When it arrives at the nodes, it waits in the pool for a miner to add it to a to be mined block. The time it waits here depends on the network capacity vs the amount of transactions that is submitted. When it's overloaded, a transaction can be stuck for a bit untill it's picked to be added to a block. (For a bit or for quite some time, this is why transactions take long to be confirmed sometimes.)
- Once added to a block and the miner starts hashing, the blocktime starts out. Now that is 10 min. 
All this time a public key is published and can be obtained. A hijack can be done during all 3 periods. A hijack during the last part, the blocktime, is explained in [this paper]( For hijacks during blocktime it has to be done withing the 10 min blocktime. According to the paper this could be done as early as 2027. But MITM attacks give a way bigger period of time. And when a transaction is waiting to be added to a block the period could be short when BTC is working within it's capacity, but when operating over max capacity this could be an hour or longer. So for these options BTC can be at risk way earlier than 2027.
That goes for any transaction. So for transactions from an unused address or a reused address. Both transactions are the same kind of transactions and can be hijacked during the transaction. Because as soon as you send a transaction, your public key is published and since your transaction is not confirmed instantly there is a window in which your transaction can be hijacked. When that window is, is summed up in my previous response. The only advantage of not reusing your addresses is that as long as you don't make a transation, your pubkey is not public and thus you're safe as long as you never spend your funds. But you want to make a transaction sometime right? Or your BTC is useless. So during that transaction you can be hacked.
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:15:08
Yeah, or maybe a lesser period will be sufficient just because the hashing power of quantum computers is less dominant compared to the newer classical abilities at that point of time.
@_date: 2019-01-14 15:52:04
There is time, but the sentiment should change. The reaction is always, "This again, FUD." Solving the problem is way more complicated than people commonly say. This includes the attitide of BTC devs. 
And as to the 2027 estimate, there is no way to make a real estimate. IBM, Goole, Microsoft and Intel have estimates that come closer to 5 years. And then there are estimates of 2030 and later. But why take a risk? There is a shitload of money at stake. 
Also, there is no time limmit for breaking the satoshi keys. So could be way sooner. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 15:28:40
[Actually it is. Here the paper explaining how. Page 8, point 3.]( 
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:29:14
Quantum computers can break ECDSA, the signature scheme BTC uses. So BTC would need to change signature scheme. 
The chalenges are in the choices to be made. Going from a 100 B signature to 2.5 KB signature size would highly influence BTC transactionspeed. Having a set blocksize and blocktime, the block would be able to handle way less transactions. It's not just simply switch signature schemes, it deserves some serious thought. Just waving this subject away as if it's not worth any time or attention isn't very productive.
Besides that, after upgrading the blockchain all coins need to be migrated from old vulnerable addresses to new quantum resistant addresses, which takes time. More importantly, a certain percantage of the coins can't be moved to a secure address due to the fact no one has access to them. Due to these lost addresses, a blockchain can update, but it will never be able to protect 100% of it's circulating supply.
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:34:57
But the lost addresses which can't be moved to new quantum safe addresses will stay vulnerable to hack for ever. 
Also: not reusing your address, isn't quantum safe. It just reduces the window of opportunity of a hijack to [the 10 minutes during blocktime](
@_date: 2019-01-09 11:55:13
Check BTC history. Satoshi coins where stored on full public key address. P2PKH was introduced later. Satoshi coins and a lot of other lost addresses are vulnerable to quantum hack. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:36:12
The hashing algorithm is not the problem. The signature scheme is the issue. ECDSA needs to be replaced. Which has it's challenges and doesn't result in a 100% protection of the circulating supply.
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:37:38
It's the signaturescheme ECDSA that will be the problem, not Sha256. 
And even though it’s still far from a quantum computer that could break ECDSA, a commercial (cloud service) quantum computer is a milestone that could mature the tone of discussions in the cryptospace about the issues quantum computers will eventually create for blockchain. Like some serious timeline predictions to change signature schemes and move the circulating supply to safe addresses. 
And an proposal that could be applied fast in case of a black swan event.
And some thoughts about how lost addresses will effect the market of certain projects.
@_date: 2019-01-09 20:22:23
That would be a variation on the proof of knowledge option then? Why would you not need the delay phase mentioned here:  (In see 4 and more specific in 4.3 and 5.1)  
@_date: 2019-01-16 16:04:18
This is a serious issue and there is no solution that would not harm BTC value. 
1. BTC upgrades, but the coins on lost addresses don't migrate to quantum resistant addresses and stay vulnerable. Eventually BTC might get hacked. That would cause a marketreaction.
2. You create a deadline within people will need to move their BTC to QR addresses. After the deadline the leftovers will be burned. The problem is that in that scenario, you don't know which coins are on lost addresses and which coins are from people who have not migrated yet for whatever kind of reason. Not everybody is part of "the community", some just glance at the price every now and then and don't follow technical development. Investing in BTC doesn't obligate you to have a reddit or bitcointalk account. And there is no preset condition that obligates you to keep up with the developments. So devs would not have the right to burn your coins if you don't migrate in time. It's a legal issue. You could say, "but we give them a reasonable amount of time, then we burn the left overs. But what's a reasonable amount of time that holds in the court of law when we're talking effectively burning someone's assets? 
There is no legal obligation to stay up to date or to move your coins if it's no pre set condition. So the ones who got burned will take it to court. And even worse for the value of BTC, they will take it to the press. You wouldn't sue BTC. You would sue the devs who burned your BTC. Those are people who's actions have the consequences that harmed your assets. They deliberately planned and executed code to make sure that BTC got burned.
It always comes down to one of the two: 1. Make a certain amount of BTC unspendable while not knowing who owns them, or 2. anyone with the keypair can spend them. When QC's arrive, both are to put it mildly, bad for BTC brandname. Same goes for all other non-QR blockchains. The only option is going QR from genesis block, so there are no non-quantum resistant lost addresses. QRL has launched this year and did so with a quantum resistant signature scheme from genesis block on.
@_date: 2019-01-16 15:51:30
How about some predictions from the companies making QC's?
 "It should be about 5 years to 1000 qubit chips with superconducting technology. It should be about 10 years to million qubit chips."
 "And a million-physical-qubit system, whose general computing applications are still difficult to even fathom? It’s conceivable, says Neven, “on the inside of 10 years.” " (That is Harmut Neven of Google’s quantum computing effort)
 IBM believes quantum computers will be mainstream in 5 years. (Meaning outside of research labs, but not necessarily in livingrooms of the average Joe. And no ammount of qubits mentioned though)
 “Five years from now, we will have a commercial quantum computer,” says Holmdahl.
And those are just the commercial companies. The pentagon sees quantum computing as the next arms race. China is about to pump $10 Billion in a research centre. They won't be open about their developments as Google etc. 
That's still not tomorrow, but combining that with some solid advice of the NAS "Even if a quantum computer that can decrypt current cryptographic ciphers is more than a decade off, the hazard of such a machine is high enough—and the time frame for transitioning to a new security protocol is sufficiently long and uncertain—that prioritization of the development, standardization, and deployment of post-quantum cryptography is critical for minimizing the chance of a potential security and privacy disaster." makes this an issue that we rather find solutions for today than tomorrow. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 08:54:26
That's the blockchain..
@_date: 2018-07-25 10:12:27
Thanks. And what is your opinion on the risk of spam and hackers clogging up the chain when small fees are standardized? (Miners wouldn't be able to exclude lower fee transactions containing spam or extremely small amounts meant for clogging the chain)
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:45:54
At this moment [NIST intends to approve]( both LMS and XMSS for a specific group of applications that can deal with the stateful properties. As to QRL: you could check out their discord channel. You can find it on their subreddit. Real lively there and any questions are answered quickly by the team or the community.
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:39:13
Yeah, those lost addresses make it impossible to protect 100% of the circulating supply. 
@_date: 2019-05-08 12:36:06
Very well articulated inerview. Easy to listen to on a subject as this. Typically downvoted to oblivion.
Only the part about outhashing BTC is way less feasable as far as I know. See this paper for a clear explanation.  (Page 4, Attacks on the Bitcoin proof-of-work)
Crypto101 refers to a different paper though. You got a link to the paper on the hashpower he speaks about? Would be interesting.
I disagree on the idea to increase keysize as far as these keys aren't quantum resistant. That is not a solution. For example going 256 to 384 bit curves would mean a quantum computer with 3484 qubits instead of 2330 qubits could break the signature scheme. That is not even double the qubits and postpones the problem either half a year or one year, depending which estimate you take. (Doubling of qubits every year, or every two years). This, while changing the sigscheme from 256 to 238 does come with the same amount of challenges and effort as it would be to change to a proper quantum resistant signature scheme. 
QRL has currently implementes XMSS as their signature scheme. Right from the start, from genesis block. 
Curious on your opinion on the challenges that existing blockchains run into when they want to upgrade towards quantum resistance.
