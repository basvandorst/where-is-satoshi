Thanks for the link. It's unfortunate that the discussion didn't go better. 
It seems Gwern had trouble believing you were sincere in your concerns. He got stuck on the language of "accusing" someone of being Satoshi and defended the fact that he'd never positively claimed someone was likely to be SN (and emphasized that the comments he had made were over IRC and not 'public').
Meanwhile it sounds like you thought that even this level of discussion was dangerous. I'd have loved to see a thoughtful debate on that question (of the potential negative effects of theories of Satoshi), but it seemed the two of you pushed each other's buttons too much and it just degenerated into arguing about timestamps on posts. Alas.

I would assume you are alluding to exemption 1, but in the absence of an infinite regress, this wouldn't appear to allow shorting nonexistent shares.  Exemption 3 also looks innocuous, depending on the particulars of Rule 200, which I don't particularly (see what I did there?) want to look up right now.
That leaves Exemption 2 -- market making.  But that one doesn't specify anything about being a primary/broker dealer, so I'm not sure it's what you were referring to either.
If you'd like to elaborate, please feel free to do so.

Except that BitPay would really be the de-facto exchange in this case, because you would never have to buy, hold, or own any BTC yourselves.
If you accept USD only and refund USD only, you can still allow customers to pay you in BTC through BitPay, but it just gets converted to USD before it gets to you.
Let me reiterate so that this is clear: using a service like BitPay you can allow customers to pay you in Bitcoins without ever have to directly handle any Bitcoins at all yourselves.  You have no BTC currency risk, and you're not creating any new risk for customers who choose to pay in BTC.

As a Bitcoin old-timer (in since 2010), this is some of the most astute analysis I've read.  I broadly agree.
I'm still waiting to see a use case in action for Bitcoin that doesn't require the end-users to know that Bitcoin was involved.  That's when I'll be willing to say that it's starting to fulfill its potential as a protocol.  
I think remittance payments is the clearest such opportunity.  That's why I'm cheering for Buttercoin to get their exchange network up and running soon.  Godspeed and co.

Hey, sorry for the confusion, I didn't mean what I wrote to be an explanation of transaction malleability (and I agree with your description).  What I was trying to say is that in addition to their system not detecting mutated transactions and doing re-sends (as you describe), I think their wallet may have also as a result of its confusion over the mutated transactions, not calculated the balance correctly for its addresses.  If that were true, their wallet and their accounting system may have both been telling them the same wrong things.
However, thinking about it again, I'm not sure how their wallet would make that mistake.  Perhaps it's more likely that they just trusted their accounting system, and never compared it to what their wallet was telling them.

@_date: 2014-02-25 23:21:01


Right, but did you understand my point that they'd have to check the value using an external wallet, like blockchain.info for example?  It sounds like their own wallet implementation was screwed up, so their wallet and their internal accounting may have been in agreement, but both wrong.
Still hard to believe that this wasn't caught at all.  But MK pocketing the money and thinking he'd be able to get away with it seems to me also extremely improbable.  I'll be eager to hear more details to piece together what exactly went down.  
No explanation I can think of right now seems to totally make sense.
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:17:38


This is actually not true. To see that it's not, imagine if the price went to a new high of $1500 per BTC, and then just stayed there forever (or continued to rise with inflation) -- are there any losers in that scenario?
The dollar for dollar winner / loser thing you're talking about only applies when price swings net out to zero (i.e. it goes up and comes back down or goes down an comes back up). In the case where there's some permanent rise in the price, the simplest explanation for why it doesn't have to be a zero-sum game is that new value has been created.
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:46:41
That's understandable :)
@_date: 2014-02-13 05:53:29
Ah, thanks for the explanation!  I'm not sure I understand this point though:


Do you wish that people who held bitcoins would spend them in order to grow the size of the bitcoin economy (in terms of number of transactions conducted using bitcoin), or do you think that people choosing to save money (store value) using bitcoin actively harms the system in some way?
My feeling is that bitcoin can be used for both, and unless the one usage harms the other, there's no reason to tell people not to do what they want.

It does seem surprising that they would lose it all.  And it's still not clear to me that they did.  I don't really know how to make sense of today's events.  Under what circumstances would you silently let your website go blank?  If you're trying to take the money and run, you wouldn't do it, and that seems unlikely anyway.  
Maybe if you lost a lot or were potentially insolvent and just wanted to shut everything down while you figured out what to do.  I guess something along those lines seems most likely to me at this point.

They're saying that your comment, "We *will* work ..." makes it sound like you haven't already started to work on the transaction malleability issue.  That would be disappointing given that you're a major exchange and that the issue has been publicly known and widely discussed within the bitcoin community for a couple of days.
If you in fact haven't heard about this issue until just now, then perhaps you should check (or other bitcoin-related news sources) more often?
I'm not sure that's what you meant to say though.  I think would have felt more comfortable if you'd said something like, "We have already taken these steps: blah blah blah, and will continue to monitor the situation through the night."  This would make it clearer that you're already aware of the issue, and have already started to work on it.

As I understand, the blockchain doesn't contain a record of the number of coins in each address, it just contains a series of transactions.  If you read through all the transactions and add up all the sends and receives for a given address, you can calculate the current balance, but this number is not stored in the blockchain directly.
If MtGox's wallet didn't account for transaction malleability, its running total for its addresses could get out of sync with reality (while remaining in sync with the numbers in MtGox's user account database).  It's still a bit surprising that this could have gone on for a long time without it ever being detected, but depending on how their systems were set up it seems plausible.

I think it's more the problem that you can't get bitcoins in.
Authorized Participants are allowed to deposit bitcoins into the fund to create new shares (which is what you'd want to do to take advantage of the price discrepancy), but I believe there's a still a [one-year holding period]( for the new shares you create.

@_date: 2015-05-05 21:32:11


I think that's part of it, yes.


I don't think it makes sense for people to price things based on what they used to be worth. The price is where ever supply and demand meet. There seems to be some demand for GBTC (presumably because it is easier for some people to hold than raw bitcoins), and the supply is lower than it could be because it's hard to turn bitcoins into new shares of GBTC.
If GBTC and BTC could be easily converted into one another you'd expect the prices to stay in line.

Demand outpaces supply.
I think you're suggesting that the price can only go up because a bunch of people bought and sold, which implies a bunch of winners and losers along the way. But the point I'm trying to explain is that when you have a system where new value is being created (e.g. the usefulness of the Bitcoin ecosystem is increasing), it's not true that every dollar one person gains is another dollar someone else loses, the winners and losers do not exactly cancel out. 
Consider a specific case of a price increase -- imagine if next week Amazon.com announced that they were going to accept payment in BTC. Presumably, this would make Bitcoins appear to be more useful, demand would increase, and the price would go up. Let's say the price immediately jumps from $400 to $450. 
This means that the whole system has increased in value by 12.6M * $50 = 630M dollars. Bitcoin holders are together that much richer. Is there a corresponding group of Bitcoin traders who are $630M poorer? No. In fact, at worst, anybody selling during the straight line rise from $400 to $450 missed out on the chance to make more money by holding longer, but nobody actually does worse than break-even in this scenario. 
In any more realistic net price increase scenario where the price doesn't just go up in a straight line, but bounces around on its way up, then there are likely some losers -- those who bought at a peak and sold at a dip, but their losses would not add up to the amount everyone else gained.
Does that make sense?

I've been thinking about how this could happen.  MtGox is known to use a custom wallet, right?  So I think their wallet software itself may have been telling them the wrong balances for addresses.  Detecting this would be a matter of verifying that some other wallet implementation agrees on how many coins are at each address.  I can easily imagine them just never doing this.

That's backwards.  The demand drives the price, not the other way around.
@_date: 2011-06-24 15:46:11
Those vertical walls indicate large buy orders (to the left of the current price) and large sell orders (to the right of the current price).  
As the price moves towards one of the walls, all of the orders at that price will have to be filled before the price can move past it, so it can be called a level of support (where there are many buy orders keeping the price from going lower) or a level of resistance (where there are many sell orders keeping the price from going higher).

Fun analogy: heating or cooling water.  Replace price with temperature and the number of orders with the amount of heat energy you'd have to put into or take out of the system to raise or lower the temperature to a given value, and you'll see vertical walls of 'support' or 'resistance' at the phase transitions (ice/liquid water, liquid water/steam). :)

When did he say this?
@_date: 2011-07-01 00:09:45
I think I must not be understanding what you're saying.  I am assuming this:
"If demand increases and supply remains unchanged, then it leads to higher equilibrium price..."
As I imagine it, each time one new person decides to use bitcoin, they first have to obtain some somehow, so they exchange either another currency or goods and services for them at the current market rate.  This is one more person willing to trade something of value for bitcoins, which has the effect of bumping up ever so slightly the price that other people will charge to part with their BTC.  Fixed supply + increased demand = increase in price.
By similar logic, each time someone stops using bitcoin, the price goes down a bit.  So, gradually, over time, the net influx or outflow of users (and the items of value they bring) to the bitcoin economy could cause the price to go up or down a lot.
That's how I see it, but you seem to be arguing that the price has to go up first before more people will participate in this economy.  How does the current total size of the economy keep any particular additional person from participating in it (unless they themselves need to be doing multi-million dollar transactions)?  Or are you just saying that there are not enough participants in the market for someone who wants to engage to find someone to transact with?
Please explain, if you care to.  Thanks.

Yes, *if* bitcoins don't appreciate in value, there's a limit to the size of the economy they can support.  But that's sort of begging the question.  What is to keep the price of a bitcoin at its current rate?  
With a (more-or-less) fixed supply, the price will fluctuate with demand.  If more and more people start wanting to use bitcoins, they are not going to run into some total-value-of-all-BTC ceiling that the economy cannot expand beyond.  Rather, the total value of all BTC would rise along with the price as a result of the increased demand.
Think of the **total value of all BTC** as the **fraction of the wealth of the world** that it wants to store in bitcoins either for saving or as a transaction medium.  If BTC adoption goes up in the future that number does too, and likewise if it goes down.  
Whatever that future fraction of the world's wealth is, **the eventual price of 1 BTC is that number divided by 21 million.**

I'm not sure why this would happen for Bitcoin more than for something like gold.  Sure, gold has industrial uses, so it has a floor of non-monetary value under it, but they floor is way below its current price.  
So I don't think the fact that the non-monetary value of Bitcoin is zero distinguishes it much from other stores of value.  And it has properties that make it attractive as a store of value and medium of exchange -- its deflationary nature, and the ability the network provides to complete low-trust, highly secure transactions around the world.  
Whether you're talking about gold, dollars, or bitcoins, in each case their value is primarily determined by the fact that other people want to hold them too.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:05:42
I don't think that's the whole story.  As said in his [open letter]( to Peter Schiff,


So there is some non-zero demand to hold BTC (and thus some non-zero price) as long as people anticipate using the network.  Wanting to accept and hold BTC for additional reasons creates additional demand.

Transferring coins to an offline wallet happens the same way as transferring coins to any other wallet -- an online computer broadcasts a transaction that specifies that some coins now belong to an address contained in the wallet.  The offline computer doesn't have to be involved in this process in any way, other than that at some point the receiving address in the wallet has to be made known to whoever's sending the coins.

In bitcoin mining you're trying to find a hash below a given target.  Harder difficulty corresponds to a lower target.  If the 'harder' lower target were actually easier, then you could just set your miner to try to find a hash below that lower value, and use that as the result for the higher target.
In other words:
a) hard_target &lt; easy_target, and
b) hash &lt; hard_target
c) hash &lt; easy_target

I'm sympathetic to the one-protocol-many-implementations view, but isn't the response to, "With one implementation, errors are copied" just that "errors" are precisely failures of consensus.
Having many implementations seems useful for a number of reasons, but I'm having trouble seeing how it isn't only a negative in terms of consensus.
Is the idea that with many implementations you'll quickly find cases where the original did not implement the protocol as described, and it's better to find these sooner rather than later?

1) Wow, I did not expect this point to be controversial.  I think you're just wrong here.  The price tomorrow is much more likely to be close to the price today than it is to be some random other amount.  Of course, the further out you go in time, the looser this relationship becomes, maybe that's what you meant.
2) I agree with you that current demand is mostly speculation.
3) Cool, glad we agree on this.
4) I think you're using the word 'demand' in a weird way here.  Demand to hold bitcoins for speculation purposes is certainly part of the demand that (along with supply) determines the price.


Show me a definition of 'asset' with this requirement.  I think you're using the word 'asset' in an idiosyncratic way, though I'd be happy to be corrected if I'm wrong.


Certainly not directly, but we can decompose the demand to hold bitcoins into parts: some people want to speculate, some people want to hold bitcoins for later use in transactions, etc.  All else equal, if one of these kinds of demand increases (and the others don't decrease), then the price per bitcoin will rise.
It sounds like overall you expect the demand from speculation to drop (since you say we're in the midst of a bubble).  And that's why you don't think the current price says much about the future transaction-demand.  Is that a fair summary of your views?
What I'd like to add to that is that the current price represents market participants' bets on the demand of future speculators and the demand of future users.  (If current speculators didn't think there'd be someone in the future to buy their bitcoins either for speculation or for transactions, why would they buy them today?)

Yes, when you generate an address a private key is created as well.  The rest of the network will only recognize transactions spent *from* an address if they are signed with that address's private key ([public-key cryptography]( enables others to verify that a transaction was signed with the private key of an address without actually knowing what the private key is).  This means that whoever knows an address's private key owns the coins at that address.  If only you (or a computer you control) know the key, you own the coins.  If someone else finds out your key (e.g. by hacking your computer), they "own" your coins too, and can spend them to an address that only they control.  
You can use [pywallet]( to inspect the contents of your wallet file and see a list of its addresses and private keys.


No, that key is kept private, and stored in your wallet file.  


Using the [ECDSA protocol]( other clients can verify that you used your private key to sign a transaction without knowing what that key is.  This is because a private key and its corresponding address are mathematically related.  


Absolutely.  If your wallet file is not encrypted, anyone who has access to it can spend your coins.

Is the merchant counting on the price to rise 30% to break even in this scenario?  If so, why wouldn't they just buy BTC directly?
@_date: 2013-03-26 06:26:09
Most of us around r/Bitcoin are invested in BTC and think the price has further to go up from here.  However, none of us knows the future, and there absolutely is risk that the value will drop.  If you decide to invest, don't invest more than you could afford to lose.

Slippage is one risk, chance of exchange compromise is another.  There should be a risk vs reward calculation that takes both into account.  
If you think there is an X% chance every day of losing all of your funds due to some disaster, but you make Y% gains on average every day that there's isn't a disaster, your expected value depends on what X and Y are.  Do you disagree with that?
It sounds to me like a_h_d is saying that his firm tries to model X and adjust their expectations accordingly.  I don't understand why the possibility of being able to do that is controversial.  Am I misunderstanding what your objection is?

Why is it a problem?
@_date: 2013-04-01 21:38:30
Well, if you wanted to avoid re-using addresses because spending coins from an address reveals its public key (and a large enough quantum computer would be able to [break ECDSA]( and find your private key from your public key), you'd have to keep track of a lot of private keys.  
I like the convenience of only having to remember one secret, and if you could generate all your private keys from a single seed this would solve that problem.  But this would not work if some of your private keys could be inferred from others.
@_date: 2013-04-20 19:17:33
I'm a bit skeptical of the premise of this article, though I'm open to being corrected.


Is that what we really think is happening?  To create buy or sell orders on Mt.Gox, you need to be logged in to an account.  So in the envisioned scenario is the attacker using his botnet to log into his Mt.Gox account from multiple computers?  Or is he supposed to have many accounts and be using a different one from each compromised machine?  
If you wanted to flood the market with micro-orders, I don't see what role a botnet would play in fulfilling that purpose, and I think the author is confused and conflating two separate issues: 1) DDoS attacks where many computers simultaneously ping a site's servers, and 2) flooding a market with microtransactions.  
I can imagine an attack where you might want to use both of these techniques, but it doesn't make sense (as far as I can tell) to talk about them like they're the same thing.
@_date: 2013-04-21 00:26:40
Would it really be so easy to create fake accounts on MtGox with those IDs?  
Why not just submit those micro-orders with a legit account?  It doesn't sound like MtGox actually tries to stop anyone from doing that, so the botnet part just seems unnecessary.
Also, I'm not sure how reliably you could expect to time the buying low.  If you bought in at the average price in the hours after the attack, you'd still be negative now.

Okay, let's break this disagreement down into parts:
1) Do you agree that the current price gives information on what people think the future price will be?
2) Do you agree that prices are determined by supply and demand?
3) Do you agree that the future supply of bitcoins is known and predictable?
4) Given the above, do you agree that the current price gives information on what the market participants think the future demand for bitcoin will be?
P.S. Also, you keep insisting that Bitcoin isn't an asset, and I'm not sure why.  I agree that it's not a stock, but as far as I'm aware, 'asset' is an extremely general term that can cover just about anything people own that has value, including currencies.  So I don't really understand what it means to say that Bitcoin isn't an asset.

If someone wanted to buy an item using bitcointip, why would it matter what the average tip is?  
Up until now the average tip represents either a token of appreciation for a comment or a small gift to someone new to bitcoin, right?  It doesn't seem to me that the size of that should tell us much about the maximum amount people *would* be willing to send through bitcointip to make a purchase.
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:52:30
Okay, that makes some sense.  It sounds like you're saying the key is a *sustained* sell-off, is that right?
That touches on something I've been pondering -- is it possible that the verification queue at MtGox and the daily buy limits at Coinbase and more broadly all the obstacles that cause a delay in new money flowing into BTC together have contributed to the price rising more than it would have if people had been able to just buy bitcoins as soon as they decided to?  
The theory is that these delays serve to stretch out the buys over time, so that there is steady growth, which causes others to have more confidence that BTC will continue to go up over time, resulting in more new users in the queues and more buy orders maxing out daily limits, etc.

@_date: 2013-03-31 21:02:09
No, Bitcoin-QT starts with a pool of 100 pre-generated addresses, but it can create new addresses, as needed, indefinitely.  Every time one of the existing addresses is first used, Bitcoin-QT generates a new one so that there's always a pool of 100 unused addresses remaining.  The purpose of this is so that you don't have to back up your wallet after *every* transaction.  If you've used fewer than 100 new addresses since your last backup, then the backup wallet file should still contain all of the private keys for the addresses you've used.

It's encoded into the protocol so that if anyone tries to mine a block not at the current level of difficulty accepted by the network, it will be rejected.  
So long as the majority of miners still follow the protocol for how to adjust the target after every 2016 blocks, then blocks will be mined at a rate close to this goal.

In which case, why would the scheme you describe be more convenient than selling on coinbase?
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:19:36
Agreed, but it means there are two solutions: 
1) replace ECDSA with something quantum computer-proof
2) a. whenever sending coins from an address, always send all the coins and make sure your change address is a new address (I think Bitcion-QT already does this?), and b. never receive coins at an address you've spent from
In reality I suppose 2) will be a helpful stop-gap until 1) has been completed, if 1) isn't already completed by the time scaleable quantum computers are practical.

@_date: 2013-03-25 15:43:06
You can implement that yourself.  Since you choose the fee for your transactions, while each miner chooses what fee level they will accept for transactions they add to their blocks, you can use a relatively high fee for a high probability of being included in the next block (whoever finds the next block is likely to want to include your transaction), and a low (or no) fee for transactions that you don't mind taking a while to get included (whenever a miner with low fee requirements next finds a block).

I've heard a number of claims like this, but I'm not clear on specifics.  I can see how someone could cause the price to drop by unloading a whole lot of coins at once, but this would require you to either first buy all those coins or somehow short BTC, which you'd have to buy back later.  
And unless you think you know which way the market will go in general (in which case, it seems like there would be simpler ways to profit from this information), both schemes sound like they've got a large probability of losing money.  
What am I missing?

Can't tell if you're defending the 1%-of-potential interpretation or just explaining your original comment, but just to be clear they definitely do mean 1% of the total asset class.
You can see this by checking against the numbers they provide.  Using the 1 year numbers (to avoid having to do present value discounting), multiply the percentage times the sum of asset class values and divide by the total number of BTC.  Doing this you get:
1% * $13.66T / 13M BTC ~= $10.5k / BTC
5% * $13.66T / 13M BTC ~= $52.5k / BTC  
10% * $13.66T / 13M BTC ~= $105k / BTC  
20% * $13.66T / 13M BTC ~= $210k / BTC 
just as in the chart.

Just to clarify, wash sale rules are about *preventing* you from recognizing capital gains losses (if you just buy back the security within 30 days of the sale).

So, I agree with you that those things all will increase the value of the currency, but what I was trying to get at was that I think they will only increase the value because they increase the number of people who want to hold BTC (and the amount they want to hold).  
If one extra person converts dollars to bitcoins to buy something, and then the seller immediately converts the bitcoins back into dollars there has been a net increase in bitcoin trade, but no net increase in demand for BTC, so this particular activity will not affect the price.  
That I think is Moldbug's point -- increase trade and activity has no direct impact on the bitcoin price.  It can only affect the price to the extent that it causes more people to want to hold BTC, and he's equating holding of BTC with speculation.

No, it's like looking for hundreds of thousands of needles in hundreds of thousands of haystacks.  Each new wallet provides both a new haystack to search through, and also a new needle to be found.
There's no reason that the chance of finding *any* needles goes down if you add a new needle and haystack.  The chance of finding a *particular* needle would go down, but if you're using a pure brute force approach, then your chances of success depend on the size of the target (e.g. number of needles) divided by the size of the search space (e.g. size of all the haystacks).  Adding a new needle and haystack doesn't change that ratio.
On the other hand, with password cracking it's not going to be a pure brute force approach, because you don't have to try all possible passwords randomly -- you can start with a pre-generated set of common passwords first.  And the more wallets you have to look through, the more likely it is that *at least one* of them has an easy-to-guess password, so your odds of cracking *at least one* wallet actually go up the more wallets there are.

That seems like an odd distinction to make (always going bankrupt, but not generally losing money), but with your comment about variance I think see what you're saying.  
As I understand, PPS = pay per share, so that means it pays for every unit of work based on its expected value whether or not a block is found, right?  Then the argument is that eventually there will be a long enough span of time without solving any blocks that the supply of funds to pay out shares will be exhausted before another reward comes in.  
If that's how PPS pools work, it seems to me that the argument holds whether or not there are fees.  No?

I disagree.  If people make use of Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, it does seem reasonable to including savings accounts in the comparison and thus use the numbers for M2 or M3.  I admit though that it's not entirely clear-cut.

If you have a better name for (number of bitcoins)*(current market price), please share it.  That's all my use of 'market cap' is meant to indicate; it's not meant as a judgment of what kind of asset I think bitcoin is.
However, I do take exception to the suggestion that it's not a useful piece of information.  The current market cap (or whatever you'd prefer to call it) provides a rough estimate of what the market participants think will be the future demand to hold bitcoins.  
If you have your own ideas about what that demand will be, you can work out what kind of market cap that implies, and then see whether you agree with the current valuation or not.  If not, you can adjust your estimates and/or buy/sell bitcoins accordingly.

ETF = Exchange-Traded Fund
The point is generally to be able to more conveniently trade some underlying asset or set of assets.  Original they were used for index funds -- if you want to track the S&amp;P 500, it's easier to buy and sell one ETF than to have to trade in all the underlying stocks.  They're now also used for physical commodities, as you point out.
The purpose of creating a Bitcoin ETF would be to enable trading in BTC on traditional exchanges and in standard brokerage accounts.

1 hour is the average time for 6 blocks to be found.  If a transaction is included right away in the very next block that is created after the transaction is broadcast, then it should take about an hour to get 6 confirmations.  
Or in general terms, it should take about* 10 minutes per additional confirmation after a transaction is first included in a block (the first confirmation).  There is nothing a user can do to change the rate at which the confirmations come in (i.e. the rate at which blocks are found), all they can affect is how many blocks they have to wait until they get their first confirmation.  This is determined by the fee they include with the transaction -- the higher the fee the higher the probability that the next miner who finds a block will want to include their transaction.
* The amount of time between bocks is a random variable whose expected value depends on the current difficulty and the network's current total hash rate.  The network collectively adjusts the difficulty every 2016 blocks to target a rate of 1 block / 10 minutes on average.

The more people use bitcoins for purchases, the more companies will want to accept bitcoins as payment, the more companies accept bitcoins as payment the more others will not feel the need to convert bitcoins they receive back into dollars.

I just spent a few minutes looking and wasn't able to find anything specific about MultiBit, but here is how the main (Bitcoin-QT) client works:
"The wallet contains a pool of queued keys. By default there are 100 keys in the key pool. [...] When you need an address for whatever reason (send, “new address”, generation, etc.), the key is not actually generated freshly, but taken from this pool."
If MultiBit works the same way, then I believe the change address your coins were sent to should be one of the ones in this key pool.  If you can recover your wallet file, you should be able to find the private key that would enable you to access the funds sent to that address.

You raise a good point that less-secure passphrases can be made more secure with improved key derivation functions.  On the other hand, if you use a long enough randomly generated passphrase, that's not necessary.  
So then it may just be a matter of individual preference whether you want to memorize something longer, or do more hashing.

Maybe a better solution to this problem would be for the client to make more explicit what was going to happen before each transaction takes place, and require the user to click something like "I understand" on a dialogue box that shows where the coins are going to go (with a "Don't show me this again" option, of course).

You mean the MultiBit wallet, right?  A wallet generally has more than one key.  It sounds like the change from your transaction was sent to one of the other addresses in your wallet (besides the one you added), so the key for that one is what you need to find.

-- 
A race to lower fees sounds great, right?  The problem is 1) with no (or ultra-low) fees, there's nothing to stop users from spamming the network with useless transactions, and 2) once the block reward has been cut enough, we'll rely on fees to fund mining.  That's why Mike is [proposing]( other schemes to make sure mining is always funded.
A block size limit is one way to keep fees from going to zero because it creates competition among users to have their transactions included in a block.

How does that mesh with krillcoin's [response](  
Is your understanding that only a fraction of BTC Guild miners use getwork (and the majority use a different system for retrieving block data), and only that minority would have to start building their own blocks from scratch, or do you think Eleuthria was using the term more generally to refer to the practice of the pool providing block data to the miners whether through the old 'getwork' system or new?

I don't think the article was very clear, because I also got the impression that this would create clean vs unclean coins.  Could you explain how the system works, and why that's not the case?  Is this just about creating known addresses?  
Let's say I buy some coins on an exchange, and a couple hops ago they passed through some illicit site's wallet.  Does your system track that?  Am I going to be able to spend my coins with a company using your system?  Do I just have to send them to my personal known registered address first?

See response to my questions, quoted below.  One way of looking at it is that this is just a beefed up and systematized version of the address labeling that blockchain.info already does, but for users instead of businesses.  
You can certainly argue that it's a slippery slope and it will lead to taint tracking, but that is explicitly not what their system is built to do.
Like I said, this system may be ill-advised, and it may be worth fighting against, but I'm finding it very frustrating that the majority of the discussion here is equating this system with one potential extrapolated use of the system.

Ah, I see.  The part about knowing how they work still doesn't seem sufficient to explain your dislike of social networks though.  Contrast with Google -- does knowing that they make money from ads keep you from deriving utility from their search engine?  I assume not.
But I'm more sympathetic to your point about social networks degrading human contact.  My own feeling is that they provide some value, but are not a replacement for more high-fidelity interaction (e.g. in person).  
As you say, they can be a net negative to the extent that they replace in-person interaction, which I suppose varies from person to person.

The larger the market cap, the more money it takes to move the price.  
So, once it reaches whatever its long-term adoption level will be, and money is no longer flowing in just due to a rapid influx of new users, the price should be much more stable than it is now.  
Of course it will continue to fluctuate relative to the dollar (and other currencies) at least as much as all the other currencies do, or perhaps as much as gold and other commodities, but that would still represent a much higher level of stability than we have now.

Okay, I see what you're saying -- if the demand slows to the point that speculators begin to doubt that their lofty price targets will be hit, then they'll sell and demand will crumble even more.  
As I see it though, so long as the Bitcoin network remains operational and it is not replaced by a competitor, there will be some base level of demand to hold BTC temporarily in order to conduct transactions in it.  I would expect the price to level off at, or overshoot and fall back to, this level plus whatever the long term demand to store value in BTC is.

You've made a good argument that there exists some property that it would not work well to model as colored bitcoins.  
For now though, it seems like it would be more efficient to reuse the existing Bitcoin network for transactions in the types of property that would work as colored bitcoins.  In particular, extra miner revenue should be considered a negative, as it represents extra cost to the users (that revenue has to come from somewhere).

From the article:

I don't think I'm understanding your argument.  I can't tell if you're saying that the price will stop going up because there won't be enough people buying, or there won't be enough people selling, or both.
Can we agree that what's relevant for the price is the ratio of the of number Bitcoins that people want to buy to the number that people want to sell?  If more people want to buy and fewer people want to sell, the price will go up, and if fewer people want to buy and more people want to sell, then the price will go down.  
Is your argument consistent with that?
@_date: 2013-03-20 08:38:48
Yeah, I think market cap of all extant bitcoins is the only reasonable way to think about what the price of one BTC should be.  And the way to think about that is to envision how much value worldwide people would end up storing as bitcoins in various potential scenarios.
Looking at the value stored in various things now helps in determing what those numbers would be.

Not trying to make any point, was just curious when exactly Randall added the BTC address to the front page and thought I'd share what I found.
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:46:31
Good point about the 175k locations.  30 years sounds like a crazy high number to me though.  Maybe that's just because I think we'll have Gattaca-style genetic engineering, partial nanotech, and possibly even strong AI by then, so I expect the world to look *a lot* different in 30 years.

Wouldn't that transfer part in the middle currently be free for them -- just changing some numbers around in some internal accounts?
It seems the only way Bitcoin is an improvement for them is if they accept or pay out in BTC.  Accepting BTC would mean they don't have to worry (much) about chargebacks, so that could lower costs, and paying out in BTC would be an added feature that some customers would want.
I'm not seeing how a Bitcoin step in the middle adds anything to a fiat to fiat transaction though.
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:24:32
Don't set prices in BTC.  Transacting in BTC seems fine though.
@_date: 2013-03-21 05:54:25
Thanks!  Makes for significantly easier reading :)

I think the actual numbers matter -- there are a number of plausible steady-state exchange rates short of $1M / BTC.  See my comment here for a rough sketch of what I think they are: 
It's this sketch that I'd like to make more rigorous with more research and a better understanding of the money supply.
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:16:19
Yeah, I think it's important to get across the idea that the hash depends both on the hash of the previous block and on the transactions in the current block.
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:57:01
They are only (possibly) transmitters if they sell their mined BTC for traditional currency.  If they buy goods directly with their mined coins they are explicitly not money transmitters.

I've been following Bitcoin for three years, and in all that time this is perhaps the best single-sentence summary I've come across.  Kudos!
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:01:42
But you could already blacklist coins now.  Other members of the community keeping track of other colorings seems to have little to do with it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:59:58


I added the 'large enough' qualification just because we already do have existing quantum computers -- they're just very small. :)  ([arbitrary, somewhat recent example](


I got the impression that private keys for addresses whose public keys were not known (i.e. those that had not been spent from) would still be safe.  Presumably this would be because there isn't a known efficient quantum algorithm for reversing SHA-256 hashes.


Okay, sounds good.
@_date: 2013-10-22 01:11:09
I guess what I'm trying to distinguish is prices on other exchanges rising just to keep up vs those prices actually driving the continued increase on the original exchange.  I'm not exactly sure how to tell which is actually going on.

Here's an article he wrote about Bitcoin a few weeks ago: 
@_date: 2013-10-12 05:46:29
Hey Olaf.  Doing the write-up was good, but I think it could be a little clearer.  This line: "Adding a credit or debit card allows users to purchase up to 10 bitcoin instantly per week." makes it sound like instant buy is a new feature, whereas as we customers experience it, an additional requirement has been added to an existing feature.
Of course it's totally within your prerogative to tweak the requirements.  And if there are business reasons why you need to do it without warning, though that's a little bit frustrating it's understandable too.  
What I think users are especially reacting to is that functionality was downgraded not just without warning and with very little explanation, but without even *acknowledgement* that it was a downgrade.
From time to time you're going to have to make decisions that people don't like.  But in these scenarios for the sake of your brand I really do think the more communication the better.
You guys are all reading this thread so you know what everyone's been saying, I just wanted to distill what I think a significant part of the reaction is in response to.
Cheers, and keep up the on-the-whole-overwhelmingly-good work.

Even Satoshi had his precursors:
"But the interesting thing is, Satoshi could be anybody. Bitcoin involves no major intellectual breakthroughs, so Satoshi need have no credentials in cryptography or be anything but a self-taught programmer! [...] by even the most generous accounting, all the pieces were in place for at least 8 years before Satoshi’s publication"
