Yes, but you use of course new addresses, so nobody knows that you are you.

No way!
If we assume your iPhone is capable of mining at 300 MH/s - which it isn't - you would get 0.00001056 BTC
per month.

Swap had been enabled but not used by raspbian. 
Would have swapped the shit out of the SD card sectors ��

You have to tweak bitcoin deamon via config file. Don't know the exact settings anymore. I think I limited dbcache and max connections.

That's because pound is ambiguous.

Rpi 2 here. Bitcoind constantly stopped even with 1 gb ram. Had to manually tweak settings in conf file to reduce memory load. 
Got my notification from  that my node stalled.

Has the blockchain been downloaded yet? You won't see any coins till then. 
Edit: make a fucking backup now!!!

If I recall correctly a previous update set dbcache to a higher value. 
Edit: yep, changed in 0.13.

It _is_ profitable at a higher price. In case the price drops again, electricty costs more than you get as reward from mining.

E-Coin in the series is a coin controlled by E-Corp. So less decentralized.

When they stop now we are screwed.

You aren't allowed (at least in GER) to make a copy of your ID because it could be abused by others for signing documents
