You have to wait when you still holding all these altcoins. I fell with you you lose alot of money, first i thougt you buy 600 for 2700$ then i realise you buy 600 at 2700. But wait until october. Do a limit sell by -20% you bought at, with 65% of every coin you hodl.
When it rises back to -20% where you bought at, you make loss but not much, and with the 35% you still hodl, its like a risk investmant
Keep your head up. And buy for 3bitcoins tenx. Tomorrow will come the ios webwallet

It look like this dont happen anymore, sitting here next to my laptop 
They allow just to withdraw with sms but just in china or 2fa
But thx buddy

I think binance is one of the best exchanges now. But they have to do a better option as 24h locked..
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:21:42
Best advise.
Buy a unregistrated SIM CARD.
Open a wallet where you dont have to show you identity.
Go to a Bitcoin atm and purchase your bitcoin with your ,,fake simcard''
Use a sunglass and a cap. 
(If the Bitcoin atm had a ,,webcam)
I dont know how the regulation in your country is. But in switzerland you have just to verify your identity when you purchase more then 5000dollar a day at the bitcoin atm.
And you have to login with an received sms code.

This is what bitcoin cash is meant
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:16:19
Why down vote guys ?
Bitcoin is just an ICO now!
No white paper mission is completed!
No low/zero fee
No instant transaction
Mini networksize of 1mb
You all will see it what i mean if bitcoin hits 14k ;)
If bitcoin will hit 14k it will cost 1000dollar to send them from coinbase or another wallet, to another wallet... in fee's
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:51:00
I already use a few exchanges thx! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:00:30

Here for the guys who want know about bit gold 
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:23:44
Bro. Trust me, buy every month cryptos with 200dollars, and split your amount in good projects, like ethereum,but please do your own research it give good altcoin projects to. And from this 200 every month you have to put 90dollars in bitcoin,
I wish i had listenend to a friend when i was 16years old, with this 50dollars i would be millionair right now
