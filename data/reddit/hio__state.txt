That's not how Google Opinions Rewards works. 
Those using the service are given demographic data about respondents, but are not given a list of individual respondents. 
For example, a firm could pose a question and Google could tell them what percent of 25-45 year olds reportedly making $60,000+ a year responded "Yes." They could not provide a list of names of those who responded Yes however. Everything is anonymized and reported as metadata.

And therein lies why economies that do this vastly outperform those that don't. Innovations are built upon a mountain of failures, this risk tolerance is precisely why the western world catapulted forward economically for most of the last century relative to the rest of the world. Throwing money at things is how you birth industries and tech like the computer and internet. 
Asia by all means had plenty of more resources and people after WWII that it should have been them who surged ahead for the 20th Century, but it was really only Japan that embraced these economic theories right away and kept pace. And now we're finally seeing China follow suit after its Hong Kong experiment which is why their economy is shaping up to be the next big thing, they're losing their fear of risk.

I don't get why people conflate banking and currency as the same thing. A bank can do fractional reserve lending with basically any asset with value, including a cryptocurrency, and people are always going to want to buy things they cant afford to pay in full right away(ex: houses).

To be clear, the concept and use of loans and banking predates fiat money by literally thousands of years. In fact it predates even coinage by a millenia. The idea that bitcoin is some "cure" for the financial concept of credit is complete nonsense. Fractional lending was invented with commodity-like assets similar to bitcoin!
Banking and currency are two separate concepts. Currency is just a medium that banks work with, it isn't what they do. Even a purely cryptocoin economy would still have banking.

Also, you're lying, the fees are higher right now and transactions throttled with huge wait times. Not to mention even more fees on the other end getting it to a form you can use at actual stores since virtually no one accepts it.

It's tolerated because people without much savings aren't making enough capital interest or really seeing much interest loss to make much practical difference for them while people with savings are largely putting them into investments like 401ks, index funds, stocks etc etc that collectively way outgain interest rates.

It actually has, a lot of it was forged in the fires of the Great Depression where we realized unmanageable commodity based currencies were unwieldy and a hands off approach a recipe for disaster. 
Take a look at 2008. The economic shocks we were hit with at the start of the Recession were far worse than what set off the Great Depression, but what was different this time around was we had developed an arsenal of economic tools to stave off the bleeding and keep the market from completely collapsing. The result was a far milder drop and much quicker turnaround time.

Yes, the government has a controlling authority over drugs, outlined in various laws, one for example the Controlled Substance Act. 
The government was informed by a jury of Ross's peers that the crimes he was charged with were reasonably proven.

An attempted murder trial is lengthier and costlier. Why waste the time and money when lesser charges put him in for life?

The only unique tax treatment that exists for currency in the Internal Revenue Code is explicitly for "foreign currency." It's not for "money," it's not for "personal property," the term you'll find in the IRC is "foreign currency." As in currency issued and controlled by a federally recognized foreign State.
Nowhere in this law is any mention made of Bitcoin being a foreign currency. This law is completely and 100% immaterial to federal tax law. 
And even if they tried to write a law to alter federal tax treatment it would be struck down by the Supreme Court because states don't have that power.

So for Bitcoin to get to the ease of use level of email it's going to necessitate people exposing their money to immense risk.
Bank services are easy to use online but they're also regularly hacked because of that ease.

The SEC has nothing to do with setting federal tax law. 
You keep asserting that they're setting some magic precedent by classifying it as "money?" It's already widely recognized as a financial money-like asset legally at the federal level, including that definition is just due diligence, that's not the point of the law. The point of the law is to tell banks all the rules they must follow handling it.

Yes, trading one crypto to another can be a realization of taxable gains(or losses).
Using an item in the video game it's from however isn't. That's just playing a video game. The IRS has issued guidance that participating in a video game economy isn't taxable as long as it stays in the game and you don't turn items into other non-game assets(key phrase here is "convertible"). 
Video games that don't have a sanctioned way to cash items out you can make the argument that your in-game earnings aren't convertible and thus not subject to taxes, provided you actually are keeping them in game.

Your understanding is wrong. The Bolivar continues to be the most popularly used currency in the country by far. The most popular solution people have turned to to deal with the scarcity of bills is to just use debit cards.
Most just spend money as they get it to avoid issues with currency swings(also because most are poor and live paycheck to paycheck). For the few people with enough wealth to save they largely don't keep those savings in the form of any currency but instead put it into other assets like commodities, real estate, foreign stocks etc.
There is a small portion of the country using crypto, but these are mostly better off tech oriented people, and those users remain a small minority compared to people still using traditional currencies day to day.

Since there isn’t an in game function and it’s against terms to exchange those items for money then the default judgement is that they aren’t realization of gains. And technically since those are earned for effort that would be income, not capital gains.
Of course if you break the terms and start selling them you technically would be expected to pay taxes on them.

Nope. The only capital gains exemption that exists for currencies is explicitly for **foreign** currencies. The law literally says “foreign currency.” 
Since bitcoin is not a currency issued by a foreign nation it does not get that exemption and never will. 
You may be asking yourself “well dollars aren’t foreign?” This is true, but capital gains are to be measured in dollars per the law, and dollars don’t change values in relation to themselves, so by default the capital gain for them is assumed to be 0.

They weren’t purely gold or silver based, and largely weren’t exchangeable for bullion(it’s not like there was a central bank in 1200 AD Europe you could waltz into with coins and walk out with bullion like in circa 1900 America). 
There was a lot of regional coinage(hundreds of them) using varying degrees of silver in 100 AD for instance, but it was just the Roman denari that dominated European, North African, and Eastern Asian trade. That wasn’t because there was a bit of silver in the coins, that’s not what made them unique, it’s because those were the coins of the Legions. When you have 100 heavily armed Centurions show up on your doorstep saying they’re buying supplies from you and giving you denari in return it’s hard to say no.
The rest of historical reserves likewise similarly derived their status from the nations that minted them, not the metallic content of the coinage, which was commonly unpure and varied.

Gold wasn’t ever really a reserve currency. Reserve currencies have always been coinage/bills minted by authority figures. Over millennia we’ve had the Ancient Greek drachma, the Roman denari, the Byzantine solidus, Arab dinar, Venetian ducato, Florentine florin, Dutch guilder, French franc, British pound sterling etc etc.

Did the comment I replied to say silver?
And even for currencies predating the 1800s gold standard most really weren’t functionally “backed” by silver. The Romans for example did not have vaults of silver for people to exchange coins for, they minted coinage of widely varying metallic content and people valued them not because they were born with an affinity for the metal in the coinage but because that’s what the Legions in control of the Empire did their business in. When the legions fell so did the currency’s usage.

Something to keep in mind is that companies can still learn from and work around patents. My company has a very critical patent on a specific construction technique we pioneered for our products. Other companies in the last few years examined our patent filing, learned from it, tweaked it a bit and have adopted something similar. Now, what they adopted isn't as good as what we have but it's still pretty good. We still have a competitive advantage but the rest of the market was able to benefit to a degree making consumers better off overall.
IP law in the West isn't perfect, but it is much more effective than near anarchy in the domain. As it stands in most cases it allows a reasonable amount of cross-knowledge while still protecting research efforts companies make by conferring a protected advantage.

Of course Tesla loves that deal, they're an upstart with a relatively small patent library and their competitors that have been making cars for a hundred years have compiled massive institutional knowledge and own orders of magnitude more of hugely critical patents in automotive design and manufacturing. 
Or put another way Tesla is like a kid offering a generic Weedle Pokemon card wanting to get a full deck of rare shinies in return. There's a reason zero companies in the world have acted on it.

Fraud is a term for **criminal** deception. What he's doing likely isn't criminal since the brand "bitcoin" isn't a protected mark.
Had Satoshi stuck around and trademarked the name there would be an easy case to make, but the law doesn't offer protections to marks no one owns. Adding to the issue is the mark has been applied and used for various forks that aren't the original code(including the one that's the "real" version in your opinion), businesses in the space commonly brand themselves with it, and the public commonly uses it as a catch-all term for the crypto space. It's as generic as Kleenex now. Anyone can brand their crypto with it.

Why shouldn't it? It isn't trademarked. 
Escalator, Flip Phone, Dry Ice, and Thermos are all former brand names for specific versions of things that failed to have anyone maintain the trademark and now literally every company gets to use them for their versions.
If it's not a protected mark then it isn't off limits for others to use. Courts don't care about POW or a White Paper. They care if someone registered a trademark and bothered to enforce it. That's the legal process for making your brand unable to be copied. Did anyone bother to do that for bitcoin?

Banks are free to choose to not do business with people they consider to be high risk clients. In the US the only reasons a business cannot deny you service are those related to protected classes(things like race, gender, religion, nationality, disability). "Use of bitcoin" is not a protected class.
PNC likely has data suggesting that clients engaged in behavior similar to OP's(whatever that may be) run afoul of issues at higher rates than the average person. It's a headache to deal with regulators scrutinizing accounts or fraud so most banks prefer to just preemptively cut those people loose than deal with future potential legal issues.
Things like random large cash deposits tend to freak banks out unless there's obvious explanations for them(eg: client has a business account for a restaurant and the cash is from daily operations). I'm guessing OP isn't registered as any kind of business which means the bank is going to be skeptical that the money he is funneling to and from exchanges is above board and being properly accounted to authorities for tax purposes.

No, it doesn't decide based on the food what it stores. What happens is ALL macronutrients that are consumed in excess of what you burn are converted to things like triglycerides and lipids and stored in adiopose tissue. This happens regardless of if your excess consumption consisted of protein, carbs or fats. 


No, your body primarily metabolizes your blood sugar first, even if you're sitting around on your ass all day. Your lipid stores don't start getting used until you tap out those glucose reserves in your bloodstream. 


This is primarily told to people today because balancing your macros generally involves eating enough variety of food that it will cover your micronutrient needs.
