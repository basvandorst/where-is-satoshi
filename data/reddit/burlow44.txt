I would say as soon as a product enters the market (taxes were paid on/for it) it shouldn't be taxed again. 
As for your gum analogy, i think there would be ways to ensure that employees were actually paid from the company. 
Obviously if a company is paying out large amounts with no taxes being paid on it, (because it's being swapped for gum/whatever), it would be easy to notice this behavior and eliminate it

once bitcoin grows in popularity, fees will naturally decline.
it's an open market, so the exchange with the lowest fees will win out. the fact that nothing "free" has emerged indicated people are OK paying 1-3% in fees. I'm OK with this for now, to help get BTC into the mainstream. 5 years from now, I think things will be different.

Cash back is good no doubt, although to compare that feature there are credit cards that exceed 1.5%. 
As for fraud prevention, simple sends a notification to your phone as soon as transactions happen, comparable to email assuming you have push email. 
And assuming 10k in cash back, that's over $667k in purchases on your card. You could probably get a credit card with a much higher credit limit if credit limits are the sort of thing you need
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:57:00
This was merely a "FYI". Some people don't want to give out all that info, and coinbase doesn't make it clear up front that this info is necessary for withdraws.

early on it would make sense if it did, because then, the only people into bitcoin were the miners. so as miners came or went, interest would go up and down, thus the price. It's comparatively much more widespread now, and I would say any link between the two is faded or completely gone.

If they ship their Neptunes on time, they will keep the mining center to themselves and keep the profit.

I doubt they were after the extra $0.6/BTC in fees. Correlation, not causation. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 19:13:33
I think bitcoin's perceived value is more on its utility (or perceived utility) than how hard they are to obtain. I would say btc price right now is all supply and demand. 
I also think miners are a fraction of overall bitcoin users, and that gap is only going to widen as bitcoin use spreads. Most people have no idea how hard it is to mine a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 02:41:37
Coinbase let's you deposit any amount of btc with no personal info on file, but to withdraw more than ~5btc they require name, DOB, and address. which isn't a problem per se, but it's not clearly mentioned either (for those wishing to avoid giving out that info)

Ah so you're not a Bitcoin authority then. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 01:33:00
you're right it's not a good currency *yet* but that doesn't matter, as the day will come when people already possess bitcoins whether that's through buying them or being paid in btc etc. 
right now there is no reason for the average person to obtain btc, similar to back in the early 90's there wasn't much use for the internet

the cost of mining has nothing to do with the price of btc. 
in fact, the more money that's put into mining may keep the price down for a bit, as the asic companies convert equipment sales (in btc) to dollars.

you're basically asking "hey make this complex system easier for me". 
it's like asking for a checkbox to buy LTC first, then convert that to BTC. It's just adding steps and proves that the system isn't there yet. It would be a bandaid, and we don't want bandaids. we want long-term solutions.

SegWit is fine, but not as a solution to allowing more transactions. It marginally (looking at the big picture) increases capacity, but that's not its design intent. Just a lucky byproduct. And it only has the option to reduce transaction fees - it doesn't necessarily mean transaction fees will be lower (especially with near-full blocks).
They aren't falsehoods, they are a reality and denying it only shows how far you will go to deny such things exist.

side chains will play an important role in the future, but it can't be the thing bitcoin relies on to succeed. Especially if those side chains are controlled/maintained by a single entity (block stream).
right now core devs should be focused on making bitcoin scale ASAP, not letting it limp along while they figure out some means to and end for block stream. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:47:28
That's a big and unlikely if. (See I can make baseless assumptions too)

@_date: 2016-03-22 20:07:15
Horrible analogy. No one here is superior to any other. We are all (except for core) acting in bitcoin's best interest. 75% most definitely is good enough for hard forking. Triggering at 75% is not contentious by definition. There aren't many opposed, only a few in power who are doing their best to suppress opposing views 
@_date: 2014-06-10 01:19:06
If you already possess bitcoins, paying with them is much easier

@_date: 2016-03-22 18:27:20
"Superior solutions" is entirely subjective (and likely misleading) - there shouldn't be any "interference" with immediate increase of the blocksize. 
And it certainly is something the mods are in the habit of doing. A large number of users have been banned for "promoting" competing protocols or talking about the block size increase. Don't play dumb. There has been so much content related to the blocksize increase deleted from this sub for no valid reason. 
No one here is welcome to promote alternate views without fear of having their post deleted or themselves banned

1) when sending a payment, it looks like a single amount (eg. 0.3476 btc) - how do miners know 0.0001 of that is a fee (or whatever the fee amount happens to be)?
2) assuming CC scale adoption (~100 million txn per day), and unique addresses for each txn, could we run into an "IP address" issue? (Shortsighted, need to implement IPv6)
3) since public-keys are contained within the set of private keys, won't 2 private keys produce the same public-key at some point?

I'm trying to figure out the weakest links here..
1) mail.com exploit. Hopefully users of more reputable accounts won't have this (gmail/yahoo/outlook)
2) google allowing text or voice confirmation (removing the voice confirmation option would help)
3) coinbase should have a time delay withdraw with a password reset. 
fwiw, I was traveling and reset my gmail password, and through a series of events (wrongly entered new password), got locked out of my account. Google won't let me reset the password again (even with 2FA) until I attempt a reset from a known IP address (so I was locked out until I got home). It was inconvenient, but I preferred that, knowing if someone else tried it, they'd be locked out too.

take this advice with a grain of salt, but it's what we do:
We put the master pass to our 1password account on a piece of paper in a hidden somewhere in the house, and told the location to an out of state (very trusted) friend. 
Should something happen to us, they would be able to access all bitcoin related stuff. 
a few notes:
1) The password can be written in a tamper-evident way so it's possible to know if someone read the password,
2) it's just the password to the 1password account, so they would still need to access our laptop, which is usually on us. 
3) they are multiple states away, so even though we trust them a lot, they couldn't just stop by whenever.

I actually would be interested in a global gas price, more for observation/comparison than anything else, but with btc, an accurate average helps give you a better picture of where things are going and where things stand with the exchange you're using. 
if btc is 800USD in china and only 500 in the US, I'd want to know that, and yes I could go around checking each country for local exchange rates but that's not sustainable long term.

As companies become more established, they will offer lower tier miners for different budgets. Knc could just as easily sell a 1TH miner (preorder) for $3500 but they "need" the capital so they only sell in larger units. Same with Cointerra, their miner is really 4x 500GH chips. No reason they can't sell a 500 GH miner for 1/4 the price (currently $1500). Once this happens, I think the centralizing of hashing power will start to reverse. (A comparison would be Apple, who only sold a top end phone for years, and finally started offering cheaper units).

campbx has the lowest fees for trading, and it's super easy. 
coinbase has higher fees, and is even easier. like dead simple. But you can't keep a cash balance with them. Campbx lets you have cash/BTC. and you can trade back and forth as much as you'd like. 
a few months ago I was into the day trading and using 5ish BTC I made almost $300 over the course of a few weeks. Fun times. 
I would stick with either of these. Both seem reputable, and both are very fast (webpage load times).

I used, and still use, campbx. I opened an account with mt. gox but never moved any currency there. 
I don't know how campbx calculates their exchange rate, but I found it to generally follow all the other exchanges, just in a slower fashion (ie - prices remained pretty flat for a given day, but over the course of a week there would be the typical +/- 10 USD fluctuation in BTC prices). 
It should also be mentioned that campbx lets you put in limit prices when buying/selling, so you can "set it and forget it" - if the market hits your specified price, campbx will buy/sell for you.

I think it was a smart move. sure, 60 years would've sufficed, but designing something successfully that outlives the designer is genius.

Then don't bother. It's only worth what you see it being worth, and that clearly isn't the time necessary to set up some accounts.

why do miner difficulties follow the pattern of flash memory (don't know the term..) ie 128, 256, 512..
fwiw bitminter lets you input your own difficulty, what would happen if you put, say, 300? 
@_date: 2013-09-30 17:17:05
so we think. i won't be surprised if difficulty increase stays at this pace for awhile. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:18:12
yeah but why all different addresses? just dump them all into few....unless it was automated (and why would it be?), sending coins to that many addresses just doesn't make sense. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 15:14:14
really? 
I can watch coinlab and this fluctuation happens minute by minute. Give it a few hours and it could drop another $10 or rise another $20.

If you don't buy now, you'll be saying the same thing a few years from now

with explanations like these, I wouldn't expect many donations.

less profitable, but still profitable.

I can't be bothered with $7 here and there either, I did it just as proof of concept, although if I had 6 figures in BTC, I could make median US wage in a couple trades. That, I would do.

People already had their CPUs, so it was only electricity they paid for. In the early days it was essentially free bitcoins

The singularity is near
@_date: 2013-10-09 17:54:03
if knc ships my units before oct 16 as they have stated, i plan to make a decent 20-30% profit (ie, 30% more than I paid for the units). 
edit: I'm prepared to break even though, or even lose some, it's part of the game. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:53:41
Can you elaborate? Say I print a paper wallet from coinbase, how would I get those coins out of the wallet into say, btc-e or any other site? 
Slightly related, if you print a paper wallet, and leave it for 5-10 years, will it always be readable? Something like recording to a tape deck...or VHS...almost no one can read the format anymore. 
@_date: 2013-09-18 17:14:15
yes CT's policy is useless. KnC will refund you for any unshipped product, at any time. (you can request a refund now for any pre-order, or request a refund after units start shipping but before your order ships).
It's more than a refund for a shipping delay, it's a refund, period. If you want one. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:53:12
you're kidding right
@_date: 2013-09-17 19:07:39
cointerra does not offer refunds, but they do "price match" (if they lower prices on a unit you purchased, they refund the difference) and ability to transfer your orders from different units or different shipping dates. 
and from what i can tell, cointerra seems pretty legit (so far..)
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:22:38
there seems to be two parts - a coinbase API, and an API key - are both vulnerable? 
@_date: 2013-10-16 19:58:32
you don't think the miner will bring in as much btc as you paid for it, but surely you aren't expecting someone to pay enough for it that you at least break even? ie, either way, I'm pretty sure you'll take a loss. Might as well mine with it? 
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:04:41
first mistake - telling people they should buy btc. I tell a lot of people about bitcoins, but I never tell them to buy. I tell them the price as increased by orders of magnitude, but I never tell them to buy. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:15:36
People always try to establish rule of law, even if that means "anything goes". Because there will be people who think some things should be off limits, and grey areas, and those will need to be policed. A new government will form, and we are back to where we started. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:06:22
it's divisible to even more, so I've heard. which would have to be the case if it literally became a global currency. 
@_date: 2013-10-01 13:59:27
Correct, and anything ordered prior to sept 1 ships by oct 15. Nothing new here, except the possibility they may actually ship on time. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:41:14
It goes 1-100 in 0 minutes

Inflation would happen without them printing money 
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:57:31
I think their prices are inflated due to how easy it is to buy. I think campbx gives more realistic numbers
@_date: 2013-09-12 18:20:43
the fact that KnC and Cointerra both are touting sequential release dates (Oct/Nov for KnC and Dec/Jan for Cointerra) tells me they are pretty confident in their ability to come to market. ie - if they felt that their initial orders would run late, they wouldn't start a second "batch". they would just keep their first batch going, ala BFL. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:30:14
No might about it
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:33:21
Why would ghash.io spend so much money on ASICs only to implode the network? They have no incentive to shoot themselves in the foot. 
Besides, unless they continue to buy ASICs at a crazy rate, they won't sustain that % of the network. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 15:13:52
I think you're wrong. Especially if kncminer ships 400GH/s in september for what, $7k? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:25:20
They do, and oddly enough, over a certain dollar amount, some checking accounts actually pay a higher percentage than a savings account from the same bank (I'm thinking of capital one 360 in particular)
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:17:00
once BTC hits $600, this will seem "reasonable". 
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:44:04
So cool. I'll send you $200 USD (in btc) for one of these...also, can someone explain what you actually do with it? it's an address, so you can send btc to it? then what?
