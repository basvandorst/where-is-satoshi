The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types that I designed years ago.  Escrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature, etc.  If Bitcoin catches on in a big way, these are things we'll want to explore in the future, but they all had to be designed at the beginning to make sure they would be possible later.  
I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.  So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network. [...]

It's cheaper than letting the network die. And if it makes spam attacks harder there'll be fewer of them.

I hope you don't get banned. Mind control is evil and oppressive. Weak too.
Rather than hiding the link, the relevant people should be allowed to address the points it makes and inform the discussion for everyone.

I read the 'letter' as Classic put on hold for three weeks to see if Core will agree a hard fork to increase blocksize.

Thank you. There are some unscrupulous people around.
