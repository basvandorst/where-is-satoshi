Are you sure?
I don't think electrum is compatible with bip39 and bit44
I think they use their own kind of seed phrase I don't remember why though (but they had a valid reason)
You can export your private key and import it in electrum though.

I read a good analysis here.
That maybe this fee bump was not made to harm BTC but the opposite.
That it could have been done to counter the EDA of Bcash which was happening at the same time.
Basicaly bump the fee artificially so that BTC remains the most profitable chain to mine at despite the Bcash chain eda dropping the difficulty significantly.
I'm not saying this is the case but that is an interresting point of view and looking at the difficulty changes and the hashrate changes it remains plausible.

Wow thank you very, much.
I love the communication, I somewhat understood your comments about prioritizing modularization and such but as of right now I couldn't possibly continue to use mycelium when it was costing me $6 to $10 more than required for each transaction. 
Here is a few question or input if you have the time:
* Are you interested in publishing a paid version (android) without altcoins I think a lot of people would be interrested (I would pay up to $10)
* I think Custom fee are very important for the advanced user in my opinion the right way to do it is a toogle in the setting to add a custom fee choice to the fee selection. Activating it would display a warning (blablabla low fee... stuck transaction...rbf cpfp...advanced user) then when sending a transaction you could choose your fee in satochi/byte.
* Glad to know about the segwit branch in progress I will follow that closely any roadmap or beta?
* Other features I would love RBF
* Possibility to enter a different pin which open a decoy wallet (very advanced user)
* Thank you for watch only wallet message signature support and bip39 support
* Bitcoin donation address? (If you send a segwit address I'm gonna be jealous)

Is there a place where the fee calculation is available online?
Is there a place where the process is described?

I assume a lot of people have old androids lying around they could use as an hardware wallet this way.
* Reset it
* airgap mode 
* Get signed mycelium apk 
* sign transaction with usb otg or bluetooth or nfc if that doesn't compromize the airgap to much.

In the android app?

In his defense he said it is more secure than a phone which I agree.
I just had an idea (for a wallet feature) to make paper wallet more secure.
* You print a bunch of paper wallet
* When it is time to do a transaction you scan the private key of your paper wallet
* And you also scan the public key of your next paper wallet for the change
That fixes several problems at the cost of more paper (and laminate)
* No exposed public key
* Private key only used once then sweeped

Your answer is right here.
a 5GB pruned node works very well. 
My advice is keep a back up of it from time to time as if it fails you are gonna have to revalidate (and re download) the whole blockchain.

So try I tried importing a qr code of a segwit wif private key in mycelium (which doesn't support segwit) the wallet added a wallet with the provided private key but an address starting with 1 not with 3.
Can someone help me understand why?
I'm obviously trying all that just by curiosity, I am not trying to get segwit working in mycelium
are segwit wif key all able to unlunck a non segwit address?

I'll check out the github.
My use case for RBF is basicaly low ball the fee in the time sensitive transaction and in case a  spam starts or a legitimate influx of transaction prevent it to be in the next 2 block bump up the fee.
My intuition is that more often than not your transaction will be included in the next block, RBF would allow to prevent transaction getting stuck in case of bad luck.
For a while even low prio wouldn't go below 250 satochi/byte I actualy had a small trick I would use airline mode to get 150 satochi/byte (as the default) send the transaction and go back online. Since a recent update it is better I sometime had access to a 59 satochi low prio.  (and almost always my low prio transaction make it to the next block)

Sorry I missed that.
My advice if you have a more powerful computer somewhere is to do the syncing and pruning if desired with this. 
Higher GPU and Ram might mean a 2 day syncing instead of 7 for raspberry pi like.
Once you have the blockchain some where start is up with your small device.

Look at 
And try your hand at a custom fee computation algorythm.
You have a few hypothesis
* 1 mb block
* 10 minutes average block time
* list of transaction and fees in mempool
* What fee should you use for a 90% chance of inclusion in the next block?
* What about 25%?

How did people managed to put the key ring in place without bending it?

Stick a worn post it with "2010 mining rig: 100 BTC" on it make it barely visible on one of the craigslist/openbazard picture.
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:43:46
I think you mean with RBF for the coffee.
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:42:50
And high fee is not a given.
The mempool still empty itself from time to time...
Received a ledger nano this week end and did about 10 transaction or so to experiment most of them with 5 satochi/B and all went through in max 3 blocks.

You framed what I have been trying to explain to people perfectly.
Who cares if we lose some miners and the difficulty take a little time to adjust down.

Watch out your private keys are visible in the picture.
