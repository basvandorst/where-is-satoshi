this is a throwaway account that I use. Im not even affiliated with the company, I also mentioned in my original post that I mentioned this on r/silkroad. Im not pushing anyone to try it im just simply writing a review. either way I thought it was a scam at first and i thought i lost my money since it took 4 hours but the coins came through. 
What I would suggest is to people use virtex since its the easiest, but if u dont want to get verified I suggest you wait a little longer and to research bitcoin broker a little longer if your not comftrable.

I didnt thought they were legit either because of their website but  tried it for 225 bucks anyways... I have to say Iam gonna use their service from now on.

its the same as just BMO, I contacted them to see if  can do small orders first just to try the service they said minimum orders must be $100, so im kind of hesitant to try it.
