Same goes for a Ledger Nano S. Either one is a great buy.

How exactly is censorship free? Say anything negative against the cult of BCH and you'll be downvoted to oblivion if you aren't banned first.
@_date: 2019-07-21 14:24:22
It's been a while since my other account was banned there, maybe their mod team has changed?
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:39:46
That's... not how it works.
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:04:07
@_date: 2018-05-08 13:06:04


@_date: 2018-05-03 20:36:21
Now *that* was exciting. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 02:11:19
@_date: 2019-03-26 02:09:23
It's both. 
@_date: 2019-11-08 17:15:21
Can you show a screenshot of the "send"  window?
@_date: 2019-03-16 02:16:11
@_date: 2019-11-11 21:53:07
Now he's closer to Bitcoin Judas.
@_date: 2019-11-08 14:23:05
And it can then send to, say, a Ledger?
@_date: 2019-11-08 13:39:52
Can you then transfer it to your own wallet?
@_date: 2018-10-16 18:37:59
Seconded! Throw me in as a vote for the Ledger Nano S, but I've used both and both are fantastic. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 13:18:33
A higher percentage than that already were useless. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 13:02:45


This is why no one takes cryptocurrency journalism seriously. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:25:40
@_date: 2018-06-30 14:14:37
I think we've got a while before we see a new ATH. 
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:28:42
I Iove that this exists.
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:36:12
@_date: 2019-08-25 00:17:41
[The Bitcoin whitepaper](
 will answer most of your questions.
@_date: 2019-08-04 01:09:11
Are you the developer?
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:48:27
Uh... [also if you look at the US](
@_date: 2019-10-13 23:18:44
And you're comfortable with them having access to every credit card transaction you make?
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:46:19
Wow, even returned the tip. Class act!
@_date: 2019-08-26 14:07:05
Earn.com is dead.
@_date: 2019-10-14 01:57:49
How much BTC have you earned for a few months?
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:40:20
Join us over in for a complete lack of crypto-only blogs and "news".
@_date: 2019-10-06 23:41:25
Cool, thx.
@_date: 2019-10-13 21:18:33
Frankly, I doubt we'll ever know Satoshi's true identity(ies?).
@_date: 2019-08-05 02:45:46
Same here! I've yet to get paid in Bitcoin, but I've answered a lot of questions!
@_date: 2019-10-06 20:49:08
Is this a new tip bit? Haven't seen that before.
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:21:50
I wouldn't sell in full, but I sure as fuck would pay off my house.
@_date: 2019-10-17 19:30:38
The meme game around here lately has not been top notch.
@_date: 2019-10-09 01:18:15
Cool, thx!
@_date: 2019-08-12 01:46:22
is very new and small, but the goal is to only have news from mainstream sources. Help us grow!
@_date: 2019-10-20 21:38:26
This has nothing to do with exchanges?
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:47:50
Except that it's the first natural place that curious people will go to try to learn more about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-12 02:20:39
I moreso meant any non-crypto source.
@_date: 2019-10-29 14:08:14
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:54:39

Kwik Trip.

I love seeing tip bots around Reddit again.
@_date: 2019-06-19 01:00:30
@_date: 2019-10-24 04:28:44
You get paid on Wednesdays? ��
Edit: Go Pack Go!
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:21:16
Wrong sub. 
@_date: 2019-06-11 02:20:24
No.... it definitely isn't.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:49:16
Ledger Nano S. Trezor is also an excellent option.
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:01:04
Coinbase offers it.
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:11:18
Awesome, thanks! I had no idea there was a working tip bot.
@_date: 2019-06-17 00:50:42
[Expected something closer to this.](
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:39:15
Very true.
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:01:01
Rework your branding a bit. That's not farm to table, it's farm *and* table.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:47:49
Right?! 
@_date: 2019-10-18 21:59:43
Not enough companies understand that.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:58:20
Does that command work? Is the bot active? Do you have more info?
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:01:01
When the government stops requiring it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:38:59
Former BofA mortgage customer here. Fuck Bank of America. 
@_date: 2019-04-17 00:05:56
@_date: 2019-12-30 16:21:26
The ones in the US all require KYC, too. If I could pop in cash and give it an address to send to with no steps in-between, that fee might be worth it. Otherwise, no thanks.
@_date: 2019-04-01 01:30:11
"redditor for a day"
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:27:12
He's like the Donald Trump of cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:17:58
Source? 
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:54:42
That was true before this exploit, though. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:29:42
I don't think you understand how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:17:54
Not to mention rectangle!
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:48:31
Fyi, you were replying to the CEO of Ledger. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:29:13
That's because the pond *is* murky right now.
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:39:38
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:32:00
No shit? ��
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:15:27
Holy shit, did that guy die?
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:07:04
How about just calling it Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:47:28
Thanks! I can see it now. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:12:48
I love seeing “Blockchain” and “Trump” in the same headline, as if he has even the vaguest of what it means or has even heard the word before. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:08:14
Here's hoping there aren't any centralized exchanges left by 2025.
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:09:34
I just love the fact that their logo is the Hebrew letter 'bet' instead of the 'B'.
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:15:22
Yeah, I wouldn't be actually doing it on a site where I cared about my traffic. Mostly just playing around.
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:55:06
I’ve got a Nano S shipping (supposedly) next week. Can’t wait. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:27:17
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:30:03
Same here. Straight to my Nano S once it clears. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:16:26
Back during the recession BoA held my mortgage and when we asked about refinancing, they explicitly told us that they can’t help us adjust the loan unless we’re no longer making payments. 
Fuck BoA.
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:54:32
Have they announced a price point yet?
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:44:43
Cool, thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:40:25
[It's got it's own OS]( presumably based on Linux.
@_date: 2017-09-11 02:35:37
Find someone locally who wants to sell. Without a bank account, you’ll have trouble setting up account on any of the exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:37:53
ELI5? Are 2x nodes being launched on AWS or something?
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:42:42
How small was small?
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:33:43
How? Asking for a friend. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:32:17
Is there any polling like this in the US?
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:53:29
All of my coins are on a Ledger Nano S. Have they announced how they’ll be handling the potential fork?
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:51:42
I’m confused, is this post just shilling an ICO?
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:44:56
Here's the specs on my machine: 
* Model: DS215j
* Processor: Marvell Armada 375 88F6720 Dual Core
* Memory: 512 MB DDR3
Already dug around a bit and it looks like it isn't compatible with Docker. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:41:29
All the instructions I can find online show for a Bitcoin Classic node, though...
@_date: 2019-09-02 01:35:00
 ...yet!
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:21:23
@_date: 2019-09-26 23:21:05
Does anyone actually use them?
@_date: 2019-09-06 12:06:13
Not in this instance.
@_date: 2019-09-27 13:53:14
The one I found near me requires KYC/AML.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:58:30
So 2x blocking nodes are actually only at 8%?
@_date: 2019-09-24 00:13:19
This makes me thrilled to be a NameCheap customer.
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:04:49
Pretty much, yeah.
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:44:36
Taxes, yo. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:53:19
Good to know!
@_date: 2019-09-24 00:39:42
I've seen a few around my medium sized Midwest city, but does anyone actually use these? The fees are absurd and they require on-the-spot KYC.
@_date: 2019-09-05 22:58:41
You are technically correct. The best kind of correct.
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:35:01
Love my Nano S. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:42:42
It's like the Trump of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:11:21
On the flip side, I tell all of my clients that they can pay me in Bitcoin. No one has yet. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:59:03
@_date: 2018-04-28 12:35:50
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:34:22
It's less about motivating my bitcoin-using clients to pay that way, and more about none of my clients using Bitcoin at all (yet!).
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:32:03
Depends how healthy your children are.
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:16:11
FYI, your ignorance is showing. Might want to tuck that in.
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:57:41
Can you withdraw the crypto from Cash app?
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:19:44
Also works. Sounds like slang for a mobile wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:37:19
This has got to be what's going on. OP sent crypto somewhere shady straight from coinbase and a bot flagged it.
Also, why the hell did you have $5k sitting with a service you barely use? ��
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:49:17
@_date: 2019-05-28 13:45:04
I'll up it to a dozen, but give me a few years.
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:02:00
Medium is a publishing platform. Like Twitter, but longer form.
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:26:26
You must be new here, then.
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:59:40
