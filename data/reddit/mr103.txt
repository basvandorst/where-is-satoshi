Great analysis. I wonder if the US government will have to publish at least the total that they have received in the auction or we can get it though the Freedom of Information act.

You are mixing a number of concepts. It is like mixing CAPEX and OPEX. The price per transaction is the transaction fee. The cost per transaction is the total running cost of the network (electricity,  depreciation,  etc.) divided by the number of transactions. 
Imagine you wanted to build this network as a single entity. You would have to acquire data centers,  software to run and secure the network, etc. but you would also have to budget customer acquisition cost.  This is your investment or Capex. Just calculate what Capex you think would be require to build up a highly secure worldwide payment network that will be used by hundreds of million of people. Then you would budget your opex. Which is the cost to run the network.  People to run the data centers, electricity, etc. Over the lifetime of the network you would then depreciate your original investment and the difference between your charges (transaction fees) - opex- depr Capex would be your profit. 
Now in the case of bitcoin this Capex is variabilised over the miners. See this Capex as the block reward that goes to zero over a 100 years. That is the cost to build the network.  Once the network is fully up and running the miners get only paid out of the transaction fees. The assumption is that by that time the number of transaction will have risen so much that it will cover the opex cost of all the miners combined.

No credits you fibber. 
Ah sorry you did say I needed to post a link to my profile to get them.

Good point. But how to ensure it goes more gradually?

I love this story and if only more taxi drivers would do this it would make life so much easier. I travel a lot as well and hate to come home with a bunch of useless paper bank notes from all different countries.

I agree with your analysis I think the price will go up. Just before the auction the price will go down though.

Bitcoin is so volatile because there is still a small volume of people trading. New volume entering the market can have a significant ripple effect. 
See it as follows. If bitcoin is only the water in your bath tube and you fill it with a big splash of new water it will go up and down significantly. However if you pour the same amount of water in a big swimming pool it will hardly go up and down.

We have enough power at the moment to keep the network secure. Don't need to continue the arms race and add more hashing to the network.

How is using your wallet via his hotspot a security risk?

Think about it like this. Facebook market cap is $175 bn. So the market has seen value in investing in a platform that has 500m users that can share photo's. 
Surely you would pay that much of you were able to build up a payment network with the same number of users
