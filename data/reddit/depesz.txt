No, it doesn't. When I paste private key, as dumped from bitcoin-core, it says it's not valid, and do I know what I'm doing.
@_date: 2015-05-04 11:45:20
Well, that's what I'm asking for, I don't see any such option.
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:27:14
No idea. Didn't try, and since electrum works for me now, there is no point in trying these.
@_date: 2015-05-04 11:46:19
Well - In "File" I have only:
* open
* new/restore
* save
* quit
Neither of these asks for key.
There is: "Wallet -&gt; Private keys -&gt; import", but it asks for password, and doesn't accept the priv key from bitcoin-core.

What PW? I didn't dump wallet from bitcoin core, just priv keys.

No idea what "sweep" is, can't find anything like this in menu.
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:27:48
Why? It works, and I was able to load these addresses. Why wouldn't it be for me?
@_date: 2015-05-04 14:11:23
As I mentioned before, I need to keep control over at least two of the addresses, so migrating to new ones is not an option.
@_date: 2015-05-04 14:39:52
I didn't say it doesn't work. It's just not there for vivid, yet. I could download source and compile myself, but that's not an option I'm overly happy with.
@_date: 2015-05-04 10:38:30
That's not really an options due to:
* I no longer have the old wallet data, just key dumps
* at least 2 of the addresses I had, I have to keep, as they are for donations

As commented in other thread - it works (though not via wallet -&gt; private key -&gt; import) in newer electrum. And there definitely were no extra characters.
The problem, I think, was that electrum, when doing "waller -&gt; private key -&gt; import" doesn't ask for key, but instead for some kind of password.

All clear. Apparently version in newest ubuntu is too old. Installed newest using PIP, and it could import keys without any problems. Thanks.

Sorry, no idea what you mean. How is that relevant? And I do have backups.
Also, not sure what you mean by "seed". Is it the 12-word string?
@_date: 2013-10-16 22:01:01


That's kind of the point. I want to make spending from it as cumbersome as possible.
@_date: 2013-10-16 21:13:18


Cool. One more, hopefully final, question - is there any tutorial on doing this? I mean - adding password protection, dumping, loading? perhaps some other non-obvious information?
@_date: 2013-10-16 20:37:08
Paperwallet - as printout of wallet binary data? That's definitely within my reach. One thing that worries me, though, is size of the wallet. Backup from my bitcoin client is 128kB. That's a lot of characters to print.

re "analog" - yes. I want to be able to store funds on account that is not stored (at least by me) in any digital form.
