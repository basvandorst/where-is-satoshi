you are locked in at the price of when you place the order. When they deliver you will recieve at the price you bought at regardless of what the current price is.

ledger nano s
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:34:42
I feel alot more safer in my nano s than i do with just leaving it in coinbase or another online wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:36:20
sounds like a piece mike mozart did. message him on instagram  and ask him about it and tell him  sent you! The piece is amazing!!!

yes they make you pay a fee for every move! btc&gt; eth, btc&gt; ltc, or even btc&gt; usd, you will pay a fee
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:58:33

@_date: 2017-09-14 12:40:00

Trezor is backordered until September also.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:17:32
I guess i should have told you im using ios. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:02:45
I actually just figured this out! Ledger and Trezor are not shipping until late August. SO i ordered one and i am waiting. In the meantime, I moved my coins from Coinbase to Jaxx. Once the coins are in Jaxx, you can access your private keys. Print them and store them in a safe! I think this is a good move,. If anyone objects I would be more than happy to hear your suggestion! Thanks.

@_date: 2017-06-16 13:03:49
Yes exactly so Im trying not to be an idiot and get my coin off the exchange ASAP. So I have a Jaxx wallet. So youre saying theres a way for me to get my private keys off of there??? Again Im new to this so any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:01:06
I just asked the same question! LMK if you get a good answer. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:47:49
GOTCHA!!! 12K sounds good to me! :-)
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:56:02
