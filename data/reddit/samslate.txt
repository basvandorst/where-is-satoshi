it takes that much resource to compare transactions? that's surprising, considering how many numbers these machines are designed to crunch. 
or can they not start solving the hash before they all share the same transactions?

very interesting problem ��

Well warren is opposed to speculative trading in general isn't he? like that's literally his whole thing: index funds &gt; trading firms. Why are people surprised by this? 
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:27:17
do the individual miners hash faster by proximity? if not idk how they'd mine more blocks.

dear god, this. the number of post from people yelling at traders for not holding blows my mind.

The other explanation is wrong. The black line is the 12 day EMA normalized against (subtracted from) the 26 day EMA. The redline is the 9 day EMA of the black line (aka the "signal line").

@_date: 2017-12-21 00:24:47
Bullshit. If they didn't want to hype the market they would have announced their product more than a day in advance, you know, the way every other financial exchange operates? 
Giving 1 hours notice before trading starts makes it **physically impossible** to "price in" the listing so *of course* they won't have liquidity. You could not have a rigged a better pump.


they're well insulated. A couple employees will get fired, their business will be fine. That is a ridiculous postulation.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:31:11
people are literally saying "BCH is the real BTC, they're the same thing". It's like selling people a penny-stock called "Upple" and telling them it's "the real Apple stock", it's unbelievable.

@_date: 2017-12-11 09:33:07
you're joking, but I honestly think that's the plan. If you're even remotely informed their claims are just baffling, it has to be directed at people that don't know any better.

@_date: 2017-12-20 18:34:07
same reason christians hate the phrase 'x-mas'. 
BCH's marketing plan is lying to traders about what/which symbol is bitcoin and removing "bitcoin" from the coin's label hurts that narative. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:31:09
trying to exit BCH after the trading halt i wrote a js script to pound the sell button once every .05 seconds because they didn't say what time exactly they would resume trading. It took me like 5 minutes to write. 
You can't stop the bots. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:45:34


it would be so easy to fuck over a bot like this tho. I don't get how this is a viable trading algorithm. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:59:30
 
edit: uh, ok.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:23:07
No joke I was subbed for about a week before I noticed every post was about BCH, lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:40:06
good game review tho
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:39:02
imo the desire to grab cheap BTC before the new year will trump that sell pressure. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:44:03

show me a market with deliverables I'll be hyped af. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:04:24
buy putting a sell order directly in front of it's sell order. The bot will have just bought from you 95 BCH at 8.5k - 1 cent ($807.5k). 1000% fucked. 
But for the record, I don't think this bot actual exists, because of just how easy it would be able to fuck itself out of the better half of a million dollars in seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:38:14

it does not endear me to BCH! 
I was pretty skeptical about BCH based on some articles I've read and I can see for myself just how radically BCH's price is manipulated -but if this is how they plan to market their coin, I want nothing to do with. This is sketchy as fuck!

@_date: 2017-12-20 23:54:04
as an anarcho-capitalist i'm only upset they halted trading. 90% of BCH buyers yesterday got completely fucked when they halted trading and left them holding 4-9k BCH they would never be able to offload at that price.

this. words no longer have any meaning. 




@_date: 2017-12-21 00:08:51
Except that's not what happened. They announced 1 hour prior to release so there was no liquidity and hype was at its max. Then they shut down trading to make sure no one else could profit from the hype and anyone who thought they were on a legitimate trading platform (seeing parabolic growth) was completely fucked and left footing the bill when they stopped trading and let the price cool SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. 
Insider trading is one thing, fucking over your entire user base to make sure no one else could profit from your insider ploy is fucking despicable.
If GDAX is going to dictate what the price should be, why even have traders?
edit: literally the only way to have profited from this event was if you had insider information
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:44:00

it's almost meme status at this point, but the more i learn about crypto the more i become convinced it does threaten the "status quo" of Bank and government declaration of what has/is value, as well as the services those two entities provide. but hey, it's r/bitcoin so i guess you have to take the opinions here with a grain of salt.

this coordination with the server, how much information regarding previously attempted number sets does it offer a new entry to the pool? Will it list available/unchecked numbers, or only assign a set of numbers to an individual without revealing the number sets currently being worked on, or completed?
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:38:41

i agree, so i'm downvoting your comment. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:26:18
is each individual number reported as it's finished, or only at the end of a given set of numbers, (IE program reports to server: "Number 23 failed, attempting number 24" or does it work as "Numbers 1-25 completed, awaiting next number set")?

these describe different payment methods, that's not what I'm asking. if you and I are in a mining pool and you make attempt 1/x and I try 10/x, do our programs share that information with each other, so that I don't make attempt 1/x and you don't re-attempt 10/x (since both have been tried already).
