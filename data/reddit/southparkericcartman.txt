I sell my kidney and bought 0.513524343 BTC in Dec 2017. But it looks like I will get all my money back with our new ICO

Idiots are selling, we are going to buy
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:40:13
And we will try to make it better

My opinion, that whales and bankers know well how to manipulate BTC. And I believe that some new alt will change the rules

You also have crypto calendars like  and "experts" from the sites like  , but pump-and-dumpers, whales, futures, South Korea/ other countries governments will always surprise you

Always look on futures  
Bankers know well how to manipulate it and it works for them

They do not know how to regulate themselves. It similar to "the government can regulate a traffic on Jupiter planet", just don't panic
