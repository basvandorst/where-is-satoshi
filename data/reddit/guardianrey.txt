Lol. I just tried doing it. There’s a fee sending it to my wallet???
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:40:46
Sorry noob question, but what website should I look it up to?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:15:54
I do not want to withdraw. I just dont trust coinbase anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:23:55
Sorry I misunderstood. So if I transfer my coins to a wallet, I won’t see any coins in my bitcoin account? Say for example, I want to sell it, can I transfer it back to coinbase to sell?

I had a mini heart attack. I transferred by bitcoins and ether to gemini now. Thanks. I withdrew my money too. Lol what remains in counbase are just my litecoins lol

It’s 19.2k now bruh
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:53:04
If I transfer it to gemini, will it go there right away?

Hey dude - shit I think I did it wrong. F***. I went to gemini, went to withdraw from exchange, it generated an address. Then went to witdraw in gdax, pasted the address. Now, I cant see where my bitcoins are!!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:36:56
I already have gdax account. Thanks, dude!

I’m a noob. Lol what platform should I be using? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:42:08
Hey buddy - i checked it out in blockchain. The webpage doesnt make sense to me. What does output is unspent mean?

What’s the most trustworthy wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:30:22
Is there a processing time transferring my coins from coinbase to gdax? Or it will transfer immediately?
