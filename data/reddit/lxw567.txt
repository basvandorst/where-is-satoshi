Reread 1 and 2 of OP. Reread again.
Then, realize that Bitcoin may take decades to buy you a house, if ever. Make a plan to do what you need to do without Bitcoin. Check out for ideas.

I paid under 500 for a simple gold ring, simple central stone (not a diamond), from a casual jeweler. She loved it. 
Don't let 50 mBtc get in the way of a life of commitment!

As far as I can tell, this is not part of the proposed tax legislation being worked out in the House and Senate. It's a separate bill, proposed by only 2 congressmen in September. 
No indication it will pass, ever.

Look up put and call options. They are different from futures.

Exactly. Craig's best shot was to admit he's not Satoshi. He doubled down, so his only way out was to say "I don't have access to these coins anymore". 
Problem is because Craig is a serial perjurer in court, he now owes Kleiman's estate the coins (or their value).
@_date: 2019-08-27 21:40:32
Exactly. I'm sure he'll try all possible delaying tactics. But in the end   he may have to cash out his actual BTC, BCH, BSV, patents, etc.

Holding capital assets in a C Corp? No offense, but that's a horrible idea, tax-wise. 
You 're getting hit with 34+% corporate tax rates vs 15-20% individual capital gains rates, and tighter limits on deducting capital losses. The corp also has to pay dividends (taxable), or run the risk of a personal holding company tax penalty if you hold on to a ton of cash. Also, you run a high risk of losing your QSBS capital gains exclusion that kicks in if you sell your company. 
You need to check into an LLC taxed as an disregarded entity (so it's just you paying the tax). I'm not sure if that would protect you from your wife's workplace rules, but it saves you from a raft of tax consequences.

For bitcoin to be an actual capital loss, either you have to actually sell, or it has to become worthless. Hint: even if it goes to $50, it's not worthless. 
When you sell, you can use the loss to offset your gains, plus deduct another $3000. The rest gets rolled over as a capital loss to be used next year (offsetting gains plus another $3000 deductible), and so on year after year.

The main thing is to file on time. The second most important thing is to pay by April 15. Yes, you can schedule an ACH from your tax software or at 
Your situation may not actually be that complicated (merely expensive), but if you aren't confident, I second the above recommendations: talk to an expert.

It's definitely not tax evasion. IMO it shouldn't even get you the normal accuracy penalty of 20%. 
The worst you're looking at, if the IRS does audit and change your return to FIFO, is being on the hook for underpayment penalties and interest from the tax due date. Which you'd rather avoid but they're not really punitive; should work out to maybe a 9% APR.

Depends. 
They can take an aggressive stance. Sometimes they don't. I'm not sure whether that's based on public pressure, or pressure from Congressmen who would be harmed by an aggressive stance, but their opinions don't always go for maximum revenue. 
But even if an examiner does get aggressive you can fight for it by going to IRS appeals - whose goal is to fairly apply the IRS position - or even Tax Court, whose goal is to fairly apply the actual law and regulations.

Agreed. 
If, eventually, they are in fact worth millions, I'd argue you could later decide it's not a scam and take ownership (and pay taxes on your income at that time).  The act of creating a wallet would be a good indicator of your intent. 
But if there's evidence you were pretending it was worthless/scam merely to delay tax, the IRS could try to move your tax liability to an earlier year and assess penalties. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:54:11
You can definitely argue that it's a reasonable fair market value. There's arguments against that (it's not actually tradeable until there's a wallet, until there's an exchange, etc). 
That's the problem with a lot of these answers. There's no firm guidance so we're left to do what seems reasonable and supportable by tax law. Generally the IRS won't have a problem with that; as I said elsewhere, the IRS can change your return, but you won't get into deep penalties for taking a reasonable, *supportable* position that the IRS ends up disagreeing with (If you want to make sure it's supportable, refer to the substantial authorities rule, or talk to a CPA or EA). 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:14:53
That's partly true. 
Common sense isn't necessarily used to create the regulations. Common sense, or to use a legal term, "reasonableness", can be used to decide "facts and circumstances", which come into play when applying the law to specific situations.

Ask the lawyer. 
If you can't get them, try reconstructing your records. A tax accountant can help you with this.

You can argue that Coinbase wasn't a reliable price, since it wasn't trading yet, and go with another exchange on that date. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:21:47
As noted above by the CPAs, average cost is not permitted. Thus, that position could buy you a 20% accuracy-related penalty.

Sure, but if you work for wages, you pay tax even though you put in the work yourself. Capital gains tax is not less fair because you traded rather than working. 
Arguably, tax on wages is less fair because it's a higher rate than capital gains.

Just use a reasonable method for valuation. If you use only one exchange, use that exchange. Or use one of many chart services out there. Just make a note which one you used. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:13:56
You are supposed to report each sell and pay tax on the profit (sale price minus basis, which is what you paid for it). 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:27:11
You'd split the original basis between the original and the forked coin based on a reasonable method. For example, when I took possession of BCH by putting my private keys into a BCH wallet, I split the basis of the original BTC between BTC and BCH. As the CPAs noted, you'd ether go 50/50 or split it based on the relative value of the two coins, which is what I did. 
Example: your basis in BTC is $100. When Bitstamp gave you your BCH on 9/27/17, BTC was 4016 and BCH 448 per cryptocurrencychart.com. So using this method, your new basis in BTC is $90 and BCH basis is $10. 
Basis can't go negative.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:50:48
If it's a scam, there is no fair price. 
If you never take possession of the fork, it may be safe to act like the fork never existed. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:47:58
I say it's when you enter the private key, or when your exchange credits your account. Just go for the day's value; don't worry about finding the value at that exact moment.

If you're a US person, you owe US tax. 
You may also owe tax in the foreign country depending on that country's tax law and possibly tax treaties between them and the US.

That's a gambling loss. You can claim a deduction for your  losses on Schedule A, with significant limitations: 
* You have to itemize your deductions. This may not help you because your standard deduction may be bigger than your total itemized deductions (state taxes, gambling losses, etc)
* You can only deduct as much as you won. Yes, you have to report what you won; this is ordinary income, not capital gains, so it goes in Box 21.

1099-Ks aren't directly reported on your 1040. Just report what you actually sold, and keep good records on buys/sells/withdrawals. 
If the IRS sends a letter because your 1099k was huge and your reported sales were low, you will be able to support your return no problem as long as you have good records. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:11:16
I decided against it myself. There's an argument that can be made, but I wasn't confident in it myself (and I'm a tax preparer). I was confident enough to take basis option 2 (3 is similar). This is not tax advice!
Note that you have to file a form for like-kind exchanges, so the IRS will have a chance to review it. If they decide to flag those transactions in general, they'll probably flag yours for review.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:32:50
If the IRS sends you a letter later, talk to a CPA or EA about representing you, or at least advising you, rather than responding by yourself. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:46:35
That depends on whether like-kind is permissible with crypto. It's not in 2018; it's uncertain in 2017. 
But apart from making an exchange, you just described PWCPA's option 3.

Little secret on finding a pro..  no offense to the OPs, but look around for a local Enrolled Agent with an established business and some recommendations. They're credentialed tax specialists, but they tend to be a bit less expensive than CPAs because EAs don't do corporate accounting and the EA brand isn't so well known. 
(disclaimer: I'm an EA)
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:34:55
The new tax law says starting in 2018, like-kind exchange is only available for real estate. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:56:39
It varies. A lot. Could be a flat rate; it could be based on complexity of your forms; it could be hourly. But it's not directly related to the AGI or size of your refund. 
If you have a fairly basic situation plus a well-organized set of capital gains information, expect to pay between $200 and $600 for a credentialed CPA or EA, depending on the accountant and where you live.
@_date: 2019-05-01 00:53:43
Incorrect. At least in the US, the addition to income would occur in the year the income (mined BTC) was actually received, at the fair market value of that BTC.
