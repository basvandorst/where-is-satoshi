What wallet application?
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:51:22
Damn you’re good. Very nice in-depth analysis.
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:15:54
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:22:20
Have you been able to recover?
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:18:51
All good?
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:42:43
Care to share how you got scammed?
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:02:02
You're sure you have coins in there?
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:25:02
Same here 
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:01:16
Where are these people? let's bring this kind of act back in this page.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:21:30
You don't understand bitcoins but you want someone to send you eh? Lol cool story 
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:57:07
Lol 
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:04:41
I swear. I feeling like punching his teeth out.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:17:29
Technically bcash was last year.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:51:18
Check the receive tab
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:11:09
OK, sorry you didn't find any coins 
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:25:05
Localbitcoins.com 
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:42:21
Can you export your seed/ private key 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:30:21
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:04:56
It's just 2 bucks, let it go.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:54:28
Just copy the public address to blockchain and check if there’s any balance there.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:16:36
OK. Try using electrum.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:02:15
Localbitcoins.com 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:47:56
First move your coins off the wallet, then import the empty private key into coinomi.
@_date: 2018-01-30 07:54:47
Try Iancoleman
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:30:23
Have you been able to recover it?
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:49:37
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:25:39
What fee did you pay for the transaction?
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:48:15
Sweep your key into electrum.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:20:00
You can use electroncash for bitcoin cash and coinomi for bitcoin gold 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:56:41
Would still be unconfirmed.
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:03:41
Download an old version of bitcoin wallet for android 
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:54:29
Have you resolved this?
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:42:43
You can try increasing the fee tho
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:44:24
Don't forget to claim bch.
@_date: 2019-07-18 22:35:09
Have you resolved this?
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:55:22
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:03:26
Why can't you do it yourself?
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:47:18
If you held btc before Aug 2017, you have equal amount of bch.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:45:14
Lol, you don't download bitcoins, you buy them.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:15:58
Oh okay. Nothing can be done about that I'm afraid.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:13:15
OK, you still have the link to the message?
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:02:43
Did you check the public address?
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:50:01
If you use a wallet like electrum it will automatically create another address to transfer the coins to.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:32:26
Have you tried this?
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:47:43
Is that your address?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:07:09
What wallet did he have on the computer?
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:38:05
Figured it out yet?
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:08:00
What's the public address?
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:14:31
Send a Message to the moderators.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:13:45
Have you been able to sort it out?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:51:46
Check the transaction history on Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:48:06
Oh if you sent it to a 3 address, it means anyone can spend it. Segwit  is not activated for bitcoin cash yet. You can try filling this [form]( btc.com and they'll be able to guide you on what to do.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:42:31
Bitcoinpool.com 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:03:13
And you're sure he didn't use the coins before he passed away 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:49:50
Too low fee, might not get confirmed.
@_date: 2018-09-26 12:13:30
Did you send it to an address starting with 1 or 3?
@_date: 2018-09-23 15:22:41
Try btcrecover on github 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:40:23
Blockchain.info doesn't require email to login, just wallet Id and password.
@_date: 2018-09-03 21:59:09
Try iancoleman.io/bip39  see if the words are valid.
@_date: 2018-09-06 22:00:31
You still have this issue?
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:11:55
Do you have any idea of your public address to check if the funds are still there, Because Judging from the time frame, It might be Mt Gox.
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:17:35
Transaction is already confirmed. How did he get scammed?
@_date: 2018-08-06 21:57:21
O.7 or 0.07, which one is it?
@_date: 2018-08-06 00:58:41
Honestly just avoid it.
@_date: 2018-08-15 16:06:59
How did he get scammed??
@_date: 2018-08-26 21:49:42
OK, strange?  
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:17:23
Just check the address on the blockchain to see if the coins are there, it would save you a lot of stress.
@_date: 2018-08-17 17:04:40
OK, this is strange. At least it should show some transactions. Download electrum from electrum.org, export the private key from bitcoin core and import into electrum. I think if this doesn't work then there must be a problem somewhere.
@_date: 2018-08-17 17:40:31
Ahh OK. Did the coins show up then?
@_date: 2018-08-13 08:05:29
How did you lose your coins?
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:19:34
OK I'm guessing your address starts with a 3 and not a 1. You're seeing the legacy address attached to your private key. To get the segwit address, go to the console tab on electrum and type this : importprivkey('p2wpkh-p2sh:your private key')
@_date: 2018-08-07 02:29:36
OK, this is overkill?! You alright there mate?
@_date: 2018-08-26 21:44:06
What have you tried so far?
@_date: 2018-08-06 07:47:34
I'm so sorry this happened to you,  but you're using the wrong site. The real one is [segwitaddress.org]( with a double d. spelling errors are common and what scammers use to prey on consumers. so sorry again.
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:41:33
importprivkey ('p2wpkh-p2sh:L4rviMkEiqsm9Y83JXagNv1hKZJfWDBCXC8d3qGdHUyrgU8SjkZ7')
Just replace the private key there with yours.
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:54:06
So basically it still revolves round America?!
@_date: 2018-08-26 21:02:20
Have you seen the coins?
@_date: 2018-08-29 09:59:39
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:19:16
Download electrum from electrum.org
Install and open it
Click on new wallet &gt; standard wallet &gt; I have seed &gt; put your seed phrase &gt; click options ( tick bip39)&gt; click next&gt; p2sh segwit ( assuming you stored your coins in address starting with a 3) &gt; click next and your coins should show up.
@_date: 2018-08-06 10:42:15
The funds are still not spent, maybe the address belongs to you or something?
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:27:29
Then unfortunately there's nothing there. But does it show past transactions? If it doesn't then you might be copying the wrong address.
@_date: 2018-05-09 05:28:00
What's the address?
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:35:34
What was the transaction Id given?
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:33:32
Bruh, that just converts 2013btc in current price..smh
@_date: 2018-08-06 08:26:16
Oh okay, my bad.
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:46:46
Yea, that's why it's called public address.
@_date: 2018-05-16 09:07:52
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:10:41
OK, then you exported the wrong key frkm bitcoin qt.
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:39:56
OK, try this: go to the console / command tab and type this listaddressgroupings. Copy all the addresses it shows you and manually paste them on the blockchain and see if any of them come up with a transaction or the coins.
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:54:50
Oh take this down, never make that comparison, he's not as powerful as a dog, let alone thanos.
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:12:26
Which means you have two seeds or private keys right?
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:27:30
OK, thought it was their public key.  Have you tried sending the coins directly out of dark wallet?
@_date: 2018-05-05 00:45:41
It's a change address.
@_date: 2018-08-19 23:31:03
@_date: 2018-08-26 21:56:13
Never received the tip.
@_date: 2018-08-03 12:16:40
Just update electrum and everything should be fine.
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:17:04
What number does the 32 character string start with?
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:51:17
Is the address a multisig or segwit??
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:44:07
Try this. Go to electrum.org and download electrum wallet, after installing, click on new wallet&gt; standard  wallet&gt; import private key or bitcoin address &gt; put key and click next. Your coins should show up. 
If you like to leave a tip 1JTE51JMWBPkoPkAboo6ybSjLmeZGZY6cx
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:53:48
how can he access the private key to sign the transaction, the stealth address doesn't show private key and what address would he need to look?
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:04:49
Oh damn, multisig requires you to have either the seed or private key of both cosigner. Have you asked dark wallet support about this?
@_date: 2019-03-09 21:16:33
Have you resolved this?
@_date: 2019-03-18 21:52:30
Have you resolved this?
@_date: 2019-03-03 15:04:08
What's the address?
@_date: 2019-03-24 05:05:54
Give it a shot.
@_date: 2019-03-09 21:39:02
As long as you've moved the coins, then you don't have a problem.
@_date: 2019-03-03 08:39:05
@_date: 2019-03-13 17:37:57
What's the real transaction id? You probably spent from it and didn't realize.
@_date: 2019-03-25 10:50:13
Export the private key into electrum.
@_date: 2019-03-08 15:49:33
Mobile or web wallet?
@_date: 2019-03-02 05:58:09
@_date: 2019-03-15 22:19:35
Not really, but you could try to remember how many wallets you used during that time frame.
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:31:46
What was the transaction id?
@_date: 2019-03-23 03:35:19
What wallet did you use to generate the address?
@_date: 2019-03-27 19:11:42
Did you sweep the wallet or you scanned it?
Is it the iOS app or the android app you used?
@_date: 2019-03-18 05:03:33
Have you resolved this?
@_date: 2019-03-04 21:18:04
OK. I'll guide you on what to do
@_date: 2019-03-24 05:04:07
Nicehash isn't a wallet. Try sending out of nicehash directly.
@_date: 2019-11-12 20:39:15
Have you resolved this?
@_date: 2019-03-18 05:57:18
Have you tried electrum?
@_date: 2019-03-04 21:16:08
Have you solved this?
@_date: 2018-10-30 20:32:00
@_date: 2018-10-12 20:37:33
Click the icon and change to bitcoin cash, you should see the money. He apparently sent bch not btc.
@_date: 2018-10-23 22:19:56
������hahahaha... Fuck off.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:01:34
Simple. Get your electrum address and send the bitcoin there.
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:23:31
In dollars?
@_date: 2018-10-23 22:20:48
Lol, obvious scam.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:34:14
Woah, nice luck man
@_date: 2018-10-30 19:52:02
The address you want to access is a segwit right?
@_date: 2019-03-15 15:15:27
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:26:09
They require id
@_date: 2017-08-07 09:43:34
Stop complaining because of 1€
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:26:41
How much dollar worth of btc?
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:23:21
So 3k ain't much?
@_date: 2018-10-30 20:03:14
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:22:27
Have you tried logging in to blockchain.info with your details?
@_date: 2018-10-30 20:11:29
If you're using electrum to import it, try this in the console tab  importprivkey(‘p2wpkh-p2sh:L2YoXxiVbaMMMCXs2P3X3H9pqjaL7fKA3r1cBzYNoK98M2Qtsrcx')
Obviously replace the private key there with yours.
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:09:18
This is a really nice gesture, thanks. I hope I win though.
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:43:58
Where did you buy it from?
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:02:59
No, just wait till it gets confirmed.
@_date: 2018-06-20 11:57:00
Resolved this?
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:57:33
Sending tether to btc is recoverable except it was an exchanges address. If the btc address is yours, then you can recover the wallet I think.
@_date: 2018-06-03 11:51:14
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:13:19
You still have forked coins
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:13:04
Bitcoin transfer is irreversible, once you click send, it's gone. All you have to do is wait till it gets confirmed.
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:22:34
@_date: 2019-10-03 07:23:11
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:06:18
When you tried importing the key to electrum, what does it say?
@_date: 2018-06-07 01:21:55
@_date: 2018-06-23 16:38:27
You mean watch only?
@_date: 2019-10-20 18:21:01
Just send the coins to a new wallet on Electrum.
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:43:07
What was the transaction id coinbase gave you?
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:13:02
Coins that split off from btc. Some are still of value if you had btc before August 2017.
@_date: 2019-10-28 22:01:26
@_date: 2019-10-06 21:48:36
Have you been able to do This?
@_date: 2019-10-13 18:58:55
Bsv doesn’t have replay protection. You most likely sent the bsv to bitstamp as well. Check the block explorer to confirm.
@_date: 2019-02-20 10:29:20
Do you have money in the wallet that you want to give the root key to?
@_date: 2019-02-02 06:41:30
Did you make a backup of the wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:41:53
Did you get to resolve this?
@_date: 2019-02-18 04:20:44
What have you tried?
@_date: 2019-02-23 21:31:49
Basically, BTC forked in August 2017 creating two coins btc and bch, meaning if you had 1 btc before the fork in August then you'd have 1 bch. Then in November 2018, bch also underwent a hard fork and created two new coins; bchabc and bchsv, same as before, meaning of you held 1bch before Nov, the you'd have 1bchabc and 1bchsv.
@_date: 2019-02-27 23:52:46
Your word
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:46:31
How many backups do you have, maybe you're restoring the wrong one?
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:27:00
The money is there and confirmed, so you should see it. Whats the name of the iOS app that you sent the funds to?
@_date: 2019-06-24 06:15:47
Try restoring the seed in electrum.
@_date: 2019-02-14 14:46:29
Did you make a backup?
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:18:33
What's the transaction id?
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:07:09
Sent a chat request 
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:15:14
Well we’re trying to understand what happened and how to help.
@_date: 2019-02-25 01:13:17
Check well caps lock, numbers, might be just a little typo.
@_date: 2019-02-25 03:35:23
Any luck?
@_date: 2019-02-25 17:57:47
As long as you have the private key, then the money can be used by you. I can guide you on how to use electrum if you want.
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:30:35
Did you get to resolve this?
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:12:17
What address was it?
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:03:25
What's there then? Maybe you sent the coins to a different address, does the address match? Or maybe you sent a different coin type? Bch or btc..
@_date: 2019-02-22 21:40:35
Did you put the address you wanted them to send the coins to?
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:18:17
Was it a segwit or a legacy address you sent the coins to?
@_date: 2019-02-27 23:39:18
Your word?
@_date: 2019-02-20 00:42:57
Who's asking for your root key?
@_date: 2019-02-25 01:24:33
I hope what you lost isn't substantial or anything. You could try locating the wallet file and manually open it to get your private key and export to another wallet.
@_date: 2019-02-16 22:40:36
Have you resolved this?
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:56:13
What's the address you sent the btc to, meaning the long code!.
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:18:14
What's the transaction id?
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:09:24
Did you send it from coinbase web wallet to the app or from the app to coinbase web wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:53:16
OK, I see where you're making the mistake. Try importing the key with p2wpkh-p2sh
@_date: 2019-12-13 17:17:55
Did you try resynching the app?
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:58:37
I'll advice you peel it and sell it. Don't trust anyone. After selling, you can decide to redeem other forked coins.
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:58:11
What’s the transaction Id?
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:21:09
It's unspent, are you sure you didn't send it yourself to another wallet?
@_date: 2019-04-03 21:45:34
When you said you deleted everything off, I hope you didn't delete bitcoin core too?
@_date: 2019-12-13 17:15:57
@_date: 2019-12-30 08:30:10
Yes use the debug console and get the private key and then import it into electrum. 
If you haven’t touched the coins before the 2017, you most likely have some forked coins too.
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:39:37
Did you make a backup of the wallet?
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:18:31
What was the transaction id for the transaction ?
@_date: 2019-04-05 12:02:15
Yea, I think I have it all, gotten the seed too but don’t know if it’s a bip39 or not. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 01:33:47
If it's showing unconfirmed, it might be. Alternatively multibit is a very old wallet, you could import the words into a better wallet like electrum.
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:00:25
Have you resolved this?
@_date: 2019-04-05 14:18:04
Okay. I'm 100% sure I have the right answers but maybe I am using the wrong method to get the sha256. What process did you use?
@_date: 2019-04-06 10:10:44
Did you send an email to their support?
@_date: 2019-04-05 14:41:03
Sha256 hash generated from Java differs from OpenSSL and Sha256Sum utilities. 
@_date: 2019-04-06 17:52:52
Did you try opening the file in notepad  on a PC?
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:28:25
So you went to Iancoleman.io, created a seed phrase. You backed up the root key and used it to derive addresses to send btc to right?
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:40:26
If it's confirmed in the blockchain, then you don't need to worry. Due to the recent phishing exploit, electrum had to update it's servers to trusted ones and therefore old versions could not connect. You could wait till they update tails or you could install electrum on a PC  and restore.
@_date: 2019-12-13 17:19:11
Does it show the same receiving address?
@_date: 2019-12-06 18:22:37
Did you send the usdt to a bitcoin address?
@_date: 2019-12-10 18:30:31
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:54:25
The original address, was it legacy or segwit?
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:49:26
Transaction id?
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:12:37
How did you create the address initially?
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:11:27
What application created the root key for you?
@_date: 2019-04-04 10:38:55
Did you mean the address started with 3 and not 03?
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:27:25
OK let me try to understand this. You created a seed phrase from Iancoleman.io, got a segwit address and sent btc to the address. Made a backup of the seed and the private key, am I right?
@_date: 2019-04-05 11:13:32
Bip39 seed with the standard m/44 derivation path?
@_date: 2019-04-05 12:29:25
Why're you ignoring my question?
@_date: 2019-04-06 10:39:25
OK. So have they resolved the issue now?
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:43:51
Okay I understand. What specific derivation path did you use to generate your address?
@_date: 2019-04-05 10:44:55
This is a nice concept. I just have a question, if for example I pick an answer Satoshi nakamoto, should should there be spaces in between or can it be Satoshinakamoto?
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:41:27
Did you originally created the wallet with electrum or something else?
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:08:44
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:56:16
Just reset the password with the email you used to register.
@_date: 2019-04-04 01:18:21
What's the transaction id or the address ?
@_date: 2018-11-10 21:58:58
@_date: 2018-03-06 08:57:04
Resync 
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:56:15
Are you trying to calm forked coins?
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:16:30
If the transaction has gone through, there’s no way to cancel. What was the transaction Id core gave you?
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:59:40
You mean clams?
@_date: 2018-03-03 07:42:07
How much was in there?
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:12:38
Try again.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:27:49
Ask them for your public key to that address, then you can give a miner and he would mine it for you;
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:44:36
If you have the private key then you can import it into another wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:13:36
No you won't lose anything, hard forks don't follow the same transaction after the fork occurs.
So if you sell 0.5btc, you're sending the transaction to btc blockchain only.
@_date: 2018-03-03 07:27:53
Resolved it?
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:22:46
Check the address to confirm if there's a balance.
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:50:04
Nice try scammer 
@_date: 2018-03-08 05:19:48
Yes you do and you're right not to use electroncash yet. Have you still claimed the bch?
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:04:24
Ok just send them to your wallet then.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:25:11
He sent the coins to a segwit address and since segwit address is not activated for bitcoin cash, the coins are free to claim for anyone who provides the transaction hash and public key, all they have to do is send it to the miner and he will mine the coins to an address you provide for 10%.
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:09:43
Use the console and recover your private key, download electrum and import the private key there, you should be able to see your Bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:56:07
Try resetting cashe 
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:50:43
OK seems like a good idea.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:59:16
 read well and understand.
@_date: 2018-03-02 08:38:24
Iancoleman.io/bip39 
@_date: 2018-11-06 06:39:50
What's the transaction Id?
@_date: 2018-03-05 12:15:44
Fuck off scammer 
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:11:13
Whats the transaction id?
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:41:19
Maybe you have two cex accounts.
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:58:29
are you on iOS or android?
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:35:00
Download electrum on your PC. Click new wallet &gt; standard wallet and I have seed. Put your online key phrase and click next. See if the coins show up. Alternatively try the offline key phrase too and see if that works.
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:03:35
Better to send everything 
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:54:33
@_date: 2019-01-17 03:13:16
@_date: 2019-01-05 19:38:31
Go to settings and reset cashe.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:57:16
they are two different things, do your research please.
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:20:00
no need to update, it will still have to sync the whole blockchain.
@_date: 2018-03-17 02:18:29
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:12:48
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:43:42
OK. It's impossible then to recover.
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:37:11
What site was that?
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:06:18
Did you use seed or private key?
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:33:32
The address you sent it to, who does it belong to?
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:00:43
when you download it, try restoring with your seed phrase, if that doesn't work, create a new seed phrase.
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:17:25
Ok that’s great then.
@_date: 2018-03-07 23:47:43
Have you resolved this?
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:20:02
Ok the only way is to talk to coinbase see if they you can come up with a deal with them, and if they don't agree, ask them to at least give you the publickey to that address, that you only need that.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:30:03
As long as it's in the blockchain then you can use another wallet to recover it.
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:25:20
click on 'help' in the menu bar (top right), click on 'debug window' select the 'console' tab, type: walletpassphrase "your walletpassphrase here" 600, type: dumpprivkey [your Bitcoin address here] this will return the private key, you can copy it now.
if you didn't already encrypt the Bitcoin-QT wallet then skip the walletpassphrase part.
@_date: 2018-11-13 08:51:55
What's the transaction Id?
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:11:55
You sure you sent to the right address?
@_date: 2018-02-19 09:42:19
Has it been resolved?
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:38:23
Transaction id?
@_date: 2019-01-17 04:35:16
OK I can spare some time to help out, just leave a tip after recovery. 
Download electrum from electrum.org
Click on new wallet&gt; standard wallet &gt; I have seed &gt; put seed click option and tick bip49 seed. Click next. The next box is the derivation path, choose m/44'/0'/0'/0, click next and the coins should show up.
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:07:03
Did you make a backup?
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:49:11
To import the key into your wallet.
@_date: 2019-01-17 05:00:58
I sent a chat request 
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:41:58
Have you been able to sell?
@_date: 2019-01-17 04:29:48
Try electrum and  see what it says.
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:53:49
It depends on the wallet you used?
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:44:24
Resolved this?
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:16:50
Did you deposit it on an exchange or your personal wallet?
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:39:38
Which is the address you sent the coins to?
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:55:13
Next time, sell through localbitcoins.com 
@_date: 2019-01-17 04:36:05
No, not really. Depends on what operating system  (PC or Mac, android or iOS) you're trying to recover on.
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:09:55
What error does it give?
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:08:43
The address from the transaction Id you sent.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:00:32
Don’t fall for this, it’s a scam he posted this on bitcointalk too. It’s not his wallet and he’s offering to sell it for 0.5 looking for someone greedy enough to fall for this.
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:51:59
I can help you out.
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:14:07
you're welcome.
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:43:56
Same here 
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:27:16
When did you create the wallet? Electrum does not and I repeat does not create a bip39 seed phrase.
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:12:27
Use iancoleman.io and get your address from there.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:17:20
Did you talk to bittrex?
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:53:09
Was it created by blockchain.info or by another wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:18:48
Have you resolved this, might be able to help.
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:33:15
Add another account on ledger and see if it shows up.
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:16:02
Were you coins stolen?
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:08:15
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:34:35
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:07:27
Where did you buy it?
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:59:47
ok go to the app store, type in bitwallet
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:05:54
click on the + sign
copy and paste your private key there. your address and coins should be there.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:26:23
no not private key, public key... you have the public address and not public key.
@_date: 2018-03-17 10:08:38
how did you go about it?
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:50:02
i read the thread, maybe it is in the jaxx wallet. and btw why post your problem on a deep web forum.
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:34:40
He meant Hotspot from your phone. That is mobile data.
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:06:55
Did you try using the tool with the password.
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:28:46
OK guess you're safe, you can try another wallet app.
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:11:37
Try the dumppriv key in the console
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:22:02
It's definitely encrypted, try remembering the  password you used.
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:44:51
what wallet are you trying to recover it in?
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:56:17
OK use this tool offline iancoleman.io/bip39  try to locate your address there.
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:46:48
Dont understand, your coins are gone?
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:22:35
what is the transaction id
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:29:59
If the coins are significant, you can use a professional service.
@_date: 2018-03-05 08:19:37
Did you make a backup?
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:33:03
Did it show up in the exchange?
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:21:27
You sent the coins from Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:22:32
Agree with you.
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:13:17
Transaction id for the wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:50:18
Try to locate the address with the coins with iancoleman.io.
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:54:22
download a mobile wallet and import your key there.
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:54:55
i think electrum has a bug.
@_date: 2018-07-06 15:30:38
i mean the address itself to look up on the blockchain or the transaction id given?
@_date: 2018-07-16 01:07:57
Have you resolved this?
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:47:46
Create another transaction and by the time core syncs it would reject this one.
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:32:37
Hahaha nice try dude.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:17:20
Try iancoleman.io/bip39, use offline.
@_date: 2019-09-10 19:28:03
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:12:08
You don't need core to resolve it
@_date: 2019-09-17 20:46:09
Have you tried restoring in another wallet?
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:33:32
Just woke up to check your update and I saw this. Thank goodness you didn't give out anything.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:59:26
Transaction id?
@_date: 2018-07-25 22:02:23
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:09:14
OK. I think I can be able to guide you for a tip. You can check my post history to see my credibility.
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:16:25
Have you resolved this?
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:41:56
Resolved it?
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:38:26
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:34:15
OK. Sent a chat request.
@_date: 2019-09-29 19:58:00
Did you resolve this?
@_date: 2019-09-17 20:28:52
Have you resolved this?
@_date: 2018-07-06 02:58:50
What was the address you gave them?
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:01:58
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:34:18
It's confirmed.
@_date: 2018-04-14 12:03:52
Were you hacked?
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:27:59
Lol, definitely. Never before of course.
@_date: 2018-04-30 02:39:41
Just go to the address tab.
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:37:21
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:51:49
This should work, try it.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:53:47
Woah, blocked for a thousand years, not sure you'd live that long.
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:58:19
What’s their source code?
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:16:22
Hahaha noob, I laugh at your ignorance.
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:47:04
What happened?
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:33:36
The address is Segwit, so it’s the p2sh-segwit option you have to choose.
passphrase are case sensitive, check and see if you put some words in capitals.
@_date: 2019-05-05 14:22:04
Okay, whats the address you sent the coins to instead?
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:17:26
Did you use a passphrase when creating the wallet with samurai?
@_date: 2019-05-18 03:35:32
If you have some coins mined years ago, you probably have some forked coins which you could sell too.
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:26:24
Use electrum, sweep the private key and then send to ledger. Be careful of scam electrum, download from their original website electrum.org.
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:04:07
Use your seed words to recover of you're sure of it.
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:06:38
What was the transaction id?
@_date: 2018-12-17 10:24:05
It clearly looks like an address you've been using for a while. Check again the coin s should be there.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:47:36
It most likely has to do with the passphrase. Try restoring without passphrase first and see.
@_date: 2019-05-05 14:31:48
It's confirmed. Check of armory is online. That might be the problem.
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:48:24
Check the receive tab for that, it should list all the bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:14:07
The website is a scam. Use bitaddress.org. Download the offline repository and generate your paper wallet.
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:00:07
The address is probably associated with your coin mama account. Try going to the accounts tab and check.
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:58:10
There should be an icon at the bottom right, click on that and it should stop the sync.
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:31:54
This happened to me before!!! Did you make a backup?
@_date: 2019-05-18 03:35:26
If you have some coins mined years ago, you probably have some forked coins which you could sell too.
@_date: 2019-05-05 14:07:34
What's the transaction id?
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:10:50
The coins are there. At the bottom right, does electrum show a green icon?
@_date: 2019-05-18 14:37:56
Coinb is a web wallet right?
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:12:47
What help do you want exactly, how to sell it?
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:36:55
Setup the Trezor and get a new receiving address.
Download electrum from electrum.org and import the private key from your paper wallet by doing this. 
Click on new wallet &gt; standard wallet &gt; import private key &gt; put private key and click next. It should show your bitcoin. Now send the bitcoins to the new address generated by Trezor simple. Let me know if you need any help.
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:49:09
What's the transaction id? If the address is spent, then it's possible to recover.
@_date: 2019-05-26 06:03:43
The reward still up?
@_date: 2019-05-28 23:38:30
What'd derivation path did you use in coinomi, I have similar issues.
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:04:38
Have you resolved this?
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:51:26
What was the transaction id for the exchange?
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:29:01
No need for it to sync. Export the private key and Import into electrum.
Click on 'help' in the menu bar (top right)
Click on 'debug window'
Select the 'console' tab
dumpprivkey [your Bitcoin address here]
This will return the private key which will start with the number 5
Once you have your private key, download electrum from electrum.org 
Create a new wallet &gt; standard wallet &gt; import private key &gt; click next and it'll show you if you have coins there.
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:00:21
Download bitcoin core, then replace wallet.dat file with the one for bitcoin core 
  
Alps remember to make a backup before doing anything.
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:53:56
Coinmania or coin mama?
@_date: 2017-06-12 04:10:10
People here talking this and that, I don't think any of you here would make up to 330k in your life time.
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:51:46
You have 1btc on it. Sweep the private key into electrum then send to an exchange to sell for cash.
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:20:25
What version of electrum?
@_date: 2019-05-05 14:29:57
You can use your seed to recover your funds if the ledger isn't giving you access.
@_date: 2018-12-09 16:07:00
OK. Don't send anyone your files, just do everything yourselves.
@_date: 2018-12-09 12:06:58
If you created the wallet on blockchain.info, simply contact them, they can help out.
@_date: 2018-12-09 16:14:40
OK, good and bad news. Good news is that, it's correct. Bad news is that your dad used a passphrase and you'll probably have to guess the passphrase used.
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:42:39
What do you mean they sent it to another address? Didn't you provide an address for them to send it to for you?
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:22:29
OK, have they resolved it now?
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:50:34
Btw did you replace your wallet.dat file with the one originally created by bitcoin core? If not, you'd be copying an empty address. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:16:08
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:23:40
Any luck so far?
@_date: 2018-12-09 16:18:11
unlock it by typing
walletpassphrase "your walletpassphrase here" 600
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:52:39
Try using the online tool that was posted in those threads and see if you can find the address.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:32:22
How many times have you received a payment on samurai?
@_date: 2019-05-26 10:51:21
Please don't fall for scams like this.
