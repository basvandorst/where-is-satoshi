How would you rate exchanging with gdax, but only using exodus as a wallet instead of transferring it to a hardware like ledger. There wont be any fees here right? although your hardware suggestion is more secure and im likely to go for this option

I dont think Gemini/binance are supported in my country (norway), while coinbase is pretty casual in norway. I wouldnt say i care that much about minimizing small tax fees, so would it hurt that much for me to use coinbase aswell? I like it simple you see :p

alright, thanks for the helpful input! :)

to be fair, 9300 isnt a bad price either

Bought mine off a seller with highly good reviews over the course of years. I know it was stupid but arent we safe as long as we generate  a new recovery seed by resetting it?

Its a norwegian bank, but this bank doesnt have a problem with coinbase, so im asuming that coinbase is still verifying the payment even tho my wallet recieved the money 5 hours  ago

To those who are familiar with coinbase:
So im in the process of verifying my european bank account. The SEPA transfer finally went through (after 2 days), but my bank account still hasnt been added to the payment method list. I thought my bank account would be added instantly when the deposit from my bank successfully went through? Is this kind of delay normal?

read up on the altcoins and make your own judgement on what you think will grow imo. You should really believe in what you are investing in (if you wanna invest in a serious manner that is)

The money I sent through a Sepa-transfer from my bank (outside of coinbase), arrived today at coinbase. This was needed so that they can verify my bank account so that i can buy bitcoin by choosing my bank account in the "payment methods" list instead of having to use a credit card

dont get me wrong, the money got successfully transferred to my wallet in coinbase. But they havent verified my bank account yet so i can only buy with a credit card still

I dont see a buy button other than the "buy bitcoin instantly" which I can only click on once I choose a payment method :l sent them a ticked as im confused as hell lol. It even says that i can instantly "buy and sell" once ive added my bank account which ive done as i can withdraw

yeah thats what im trying to do, but the hardware wallet doesnt ship until march, so this is only a temporary solution

Currently setting up my ledger nano s for the first time.
Im pretty new to this. What adress type should I choose? Legacy or segwit? Ive heard segwit is better, but will it be able to recive the bitcoins i have on my coinbase account?
And does kraken support segwit adresses aswell?

hmm, didnt happen to me. Only used the debit card once tho, but it was recent
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:51:49
So until ive obtained a hardware wallet, what is a good free wallet to use in the meantime if i would like to invest in a coin? Is it safe to store it in, lets say, the coinbase wallet? I wont recieve my hardware wallet until next month.

Kys pls

do u have a european account aswell? im starting to think that europeans can only withdraw euro back to our bank acc once we've linked it. This sucks because I then have to wait 1-2 days everytime I want to invest in a sudden dip that might not exist at the time when my money arrives unless I pay a higher fee by using a visa card.
