there's already a years-old, well-established bitcoin market and developer IRC presence in  and  on the [Freenode IRC network.](
Id be quite wary of newly-advertised venues of this kind, could be a honeypot to attract future victims of bitcoin theft.

Obviously bitcoin isn't at $10,000 USD valuation YET, because indeed at the moment it IS still quite hard for an average user to grasp and to handle. 
The current valuation is based mainly upon:
A)  its utility to a select, small group of people who trust bitcoin for darknet and cross-border transactions (not all of which are illegitimate, but likely some major fraction,)
B) the reasonable *expectation* that bitcoin *may, in time* realize some of what has been promised around, for, and about it.
Probably only after these (and other) MAJOR issues are addressed will the price attain its projected higher levels. These are just a few, there are many other problems.
1) Scalability. 7 transactions per second does not scale nationally, let alone globally. (Solution: see [Bitcoin Lightning presentation] (    ) and [accompanying PDF paper.] (  )  No amount of hand-waving or wishing alters that fact. TPS must go up by one method or another for bitcoin to continue to gain traction.
(Tangentially:  chargebacks / escrow issues are addressed in the Lightning presentation above.)
2) Volatility.
Volatility will drop if / when the market cap increases to match other global asset classes, e.g. precious metals, treasury notes, etc. In the 100's of billions and more. My guess is that at present it is being artificially controlled by the current major stake holders in hopes of building public trust -- and they are doing so in part by burning some of their VC cap funds to absorb the minor waves that the "little whales" of bitcoin's early times (these are still the early times) continue to make as they keep trying to shake out weak-hand investors with panic buying / selling.
3) Usability
Easy-to-use, secure wallets that average users can learn to manage without too much effort.

So far no one in this thread has mentioned the **crucial** issue of secure random number generation. That old laptop you dedicate for generating offline bitcoin cold storage wallets - where exactly is it getting random numbers / entropy for the private key?  Answer: unless you've taken a great deal of trouble to purchase and configure a good external hardware random number generator, that laptop is most likely obtaining pseudo-random numbers from clock skew, network interface timing, or a lot of other questionable sources.
When bitcoin takes off future hackers will invest the time to reverse engineer the pseudoRNGs in current and older laptops, desktops, etc. in hopes of finding any trace of bias to give them an edge or starting point for attacking private keys. Cold offline storage provides no protection against a weak private key.
For any amount of bitcoin &gt;$10,000 USD, you should [generate your own random numbers using dice.](
Also, someone's remark about head injuries is salient - your plan should not have a single point of failure, including you.
As for the trolls suggesting you don't really have millions to invest - irrelevant. Maybe you do, maybe you don't. The question is important for anyone who wants to keep significant amounts of actual bitcoins personally. (As opposed to owning shares of bitcoin mutual funds, etfs, etc.)

Clearly Coinbase is doing the slow, patient work few or no bitcoin enterprises have done before - learning and respecting all the great many financial rules required of financial institutions. 
Because bitcoin has had such a poor reputation to date (up to and through 2014,) I'm sure Coinbase is undergoing additional, perhaps even hostile scrutiny from regulators. They have to err on the side of caution and NOT give the benefit of the doubt. 
In time, perhaps a year or two, maybe less, I suspect things may loosen up, and/or competitors may appear. I wonder if they will be as trustworthy as Coinbase has been to date.

Not possible to say without further context. Is this 1-2% of OPs investable assets - acceptable... or 10% - questionable...or &gt;25%? - very likely foolish.

I downvoted this just because the title is purposely obfuscatory. 
This is a *resolution*, not really a bill in the usual sense of "a specific law about to be passed."
And all the resolution is, is that Utah fund a committee to *STUDY* the *POSSIBILITY* of accepting bitcoin as payment for government services, etc. And that said *committee* get back to the state with answers and findings *IN mid-2016*.

My sentiments exactly.
