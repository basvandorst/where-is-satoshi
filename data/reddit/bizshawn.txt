I know, personally im buying 200$ worth of bitcoin every 2 weeks for the upcoming months so no worries. 
But i still hope for that dip to buy loads of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:07:32
Naa thats not rich lol, if you sell them in a year or so when the price is $10k+ you will have 200k. 
Thats kinda rich lol 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:30:14
I guess 3500 if not lower 
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:14:48
Then maybe buy a fraction of a bitcoin :) 
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:45:23
yes I think theres gonna be a dip too in September/Oktober with the other hardfork 
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:05:31
yes in sept / oct
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:06:56
Not enough yet. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:10:21
haha yup. But bitcoin can become so much more in a few years. There are investors that speculates that the price will be over $100k in maybe 5-10 years. 
20x 100k = 2 million ;) thats rich 
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:04:47
You got some big balls my friend. Goodluck ��
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:56:40
Just buy a fuck load in the next correction/dip and hodl! 
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:12:48
great man, you will double or even triple it within a year I think
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:35:54
Using Kraken for a few years now &amp; everything gone smooth. Never had any problems. 
Otherwise use 
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:25:37
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:44:57
Dont know,its the standard amount of fee when I put in on "prioirity" on 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:50:38
Welcome man, you'll not regret it trust me! Atleast you will have doubled it in 6 months I think 
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:03:12
Dont know, I copied it from the forum bitcointalk. It means "Hold On for Dear Life"
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:35:24
Learn from it
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:03:14
Shapeshift to monero &amp; back to bitcoin? I can be incorrect just trying to give you some options haha 
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:27:35
buy a trezor, im buying one next month too
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:31:59
ye y'all better sell so I can buy when the price drops thanks 
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:05:14
Yes, not millionares but just a decent amount of money 
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:50:36
Dont get yourself in trouble man 
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:27:26
You think the price will go down around the time of the next hardfork?
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:37:39
Wait for a correction and buy it. 
I THINK that there's going to be a price drop in november because of the SegWit2x thing. Thats where im waiting for too
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:00:53
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:41:35
Some people said that you can send your coins to a wallet that supports bch, to claim my bch. Is this true? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:16:54
ye man I feel you. I really want to invest way more than I already did, and my target is to buy around $3000,- per bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:49:27
100% Safe 
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:42:11
There will be loads of millionaires by then (incl me lol) 
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:26:53
Thats true, maybe look for some smaller altcoins that you can afford. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:40:25
I paid 2.40$ for 15$ to be send .. and still waiting after 1 hour 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:39:44
I hope it crashes below $3000, But i think it wont happen
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:06:24
True, but I think when they decide to do that we all sell our coins immediately before its too late 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:51:13
Monero .. Just saying 
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:20:14
At this time you can better buy once per month as you said. 
When there's a dip you can buy more at once. This is what I do 
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:17:19
my brother makes money holding bitcoins too. He buys btc using USD with a bank account
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:13:14
Lets pray for just one big dip so we all can buy loads of bitcoins. I would be happy if it crashes to $2500-$3000! 
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:46:40
its never too late to invest in bitcoin my friend 
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:39:52
Could be possible too 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:19:58
3000 is the bottom I think
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:28:52
You had to wait a few more hours to get more profit haha 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:58:41
why would you wash bitcoins though 
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:11:04
$2500 possible?
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:16:30
Im holding BTC &amp; ETH.
Ethereum will follow bitcoin, like Silver follows Gold ��
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:13:38
I will just buy another load when it reaches around $2600 to be sure 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:41:44
1000$ is still much money on your 16th ;)
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:49:04
Exactly, I really trust in bitcoin and really believe in will be worth more than $50k+ in maybe 10 ten yeras
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:23:32
 20% fee
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:16:42
Want that too, but I guess it not happening soon or later. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:14:22
I think that there will be a small drop as soon as it hits $4000. Some holders will sell (some of their) coins at this price. (like it happened at $2000 &amp; $3000) 
Or we go straight to $5000 with a correction somewhere
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:32:48
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:20:40
I hope so, so I can buy way more :) 
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:03:31
Just ordered mine with 20% off! Looking forward to it
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:34:10
Bithumb already at $10.780,- 
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:44:56
No, just do you own research on coins and you will make much more profit! 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:37:47
2 - 0.95 = 1.05 + 0.10 = 1.15 quick maths
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:09:19
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:27:52
Buy 1 oktober 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:25:16
I'd atleast buy a car from 50k .. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:14:42
How long has it been? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:59:05
I started with 0.5btc a year ago
@_date: 2017-09-21 13:08:22
We want slow natural growth. Big pumps &amp; dumps isn't what we want. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:19:52
ye but you can invest a piece of that 400k into other things man
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:00:15
Is there a meeting tomorrow? between what markets
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:56:35
"Am I rich yet?" 
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:45:12
There are web-wallets &amp; mobile wallets coming very soon! 
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:48:44
Bittrex &amp; Kraken
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:39:00
Tell me someone. Is $1.30 ths bottom? 
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:03:00
I'd buy now &amp; I think you can store them in your electrum wallet, but im not sure. 
Maybe ask here r/NavCoin 
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:52:27
Exactly 
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:57:30
Thanks man 
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:10:26
I think between $2950-$3100
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:29:22
Go for it bro, but never panic sell! The price will almost always recover 
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:03:00
You need to take risks to get rich
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:59:23
yup haha 
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:33:43
Ohh I see, I thought you already had 2000$ ready to invest. 
You can invest every 2 weeks/once a month or wait for a dip, but since we're now in a dip the next can be in weeks or even months. 
I personally expect a dip before the segwit2x hardfork in November, thats where im buying my coins in too.
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:19:50
The price of btc will most likely recover after every dip. It always recovered the past few years 
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:51:15
Fellow dutchy :)
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:45:52
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:26:19
You will get the price you ordered today, the problem for me is that I sent my fiat to my kraken wallet friday &amp; the banks are closing friday .. They will process my transaction this monday. 
If you have fiat money in your account now, it will be an instant buy if you buy any crypto. If not, you will have to wait till monday
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:20:08
watch out for chargebacks. I warned you .. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:41:00
Like me haha, entered $4500 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:26:42
Yes, sort of 
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:43:47
Buy order on $3000 :) 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:09:57
Maybe its just me but I love my car, but besides buying a new car I would definitely start travelling the world if I had that much money/btc
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:01:03
Kraken.com &amp; ledger nano S en  
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:00:18

Some people even take profit from it, haha. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:41:13

@_date: 2017-09-03 21:13:05
Depends on what coin you invest in, the risk that bitcoin will crash is way lower then an altcoin to crash. What coin are you looking at?
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:43:56
ye I sent money to my wallet friday morning online 
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:44:36

@_date: 2017-09-05 17:35:27
I saw it too a few weeks ago lol
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:19:10
Im not used to gdax but I think you just have to deposit money with your bank. And if you want to buy neo, you have to buy btc first &amp; then you can buy neo with btc on some exchanges 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:35:19
50k is 10 times the worth of 5k (estimated price now) he owns around 8 coins .. 8x50k= $400k
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:28:18
See it as a chance to buy more :)
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:27:52
Buy 1 oktober 
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:24:27

Yes, I never had problems with it
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:44:43
He thinks that bitcoin is dead &amp; will not recover I guess
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:21:08

@_date: 2017-09-02 17:34:35
ohh no haha, you have to deposit your $$ to an exchange and on the exchange you can buy crypto with it. May I ask what exchange you're using? or going to use 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:50:40
The problem is, I spent my fiat on the last dip a few weeks ago .. damn
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:59:23

before the hardfork
my theory is that people will sell their bitcoin gold &amp; buy btc with it :)
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:49:18
What if someone chargeback? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:16:13
I hope the dip stays till monday because then my money arrives in my Kraken wallet to buy some more  btc &amp; xmr :) How long does this will last do you think? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:56:09
Have you opened the dispute?

@_date: 2017-10-22 22:32:58
Coinbase &amp; Kraken
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:17:40
Go for altcoins, they can easily double/5x/10x within weeks/months. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:16:54
For bitcoin maybe buy 0.5 of it. (~2200)
I dont know your financial situation but NEVER invest more than you can afford to lose :) 
I personally think that bitcoin will be over +10k$ in 12 months so you will double your investment 
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:00:26
Go to your electrum wallet, find your "receiving adress". 
Go to Cex and go to withdraw
Send your coins to your receiving adress
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:13:25
No clue what emergent consensus is. 
Yes the 83% is amount of miners (in %) that are supporting 2x. It doesn't mean that 2x will be the dominant coin when the fork happens. 
If im wrong, please someone correct me. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:05:50
Not enough

Using it for 3 years now, never had a problem with it. You can own your private keys.
