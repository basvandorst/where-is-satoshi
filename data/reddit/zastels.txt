Wouldn't it be more expensive to convert to USD than to Tether? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:22:26
Hey thank you so much! I have a question tho!
So why not send say 10 BTC at low priority fee, and then send 1 BTC at highest priority, wouldn't that save you money on transactions since they are calculated satoshi per byte? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:37:21
I'm not giving up on open source, everyone on this planet can work together to solve this problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:58:43
Not if they're drunk. 
So never. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:14:15
ya but at the speed BTC crashes, you wont have to keep it in Tether long.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:07:20
I know I made a mistake, but the fact that coins can be destroyed doing this seems like an even larger mistake. 
I have a feeling I can get these back. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:52:49
The reason this is on my mind so much is because normally in life I'm so quick to think up solutions to problems. This problem however is like the most insane problem I've ever tried to work out myself.
I imagine everyone picking up coffee on the way to work and purchasing it with bitcoin, and then I see a nuclear power plant dedicated to powering the processing all of that information lol. 
I however believe so strongly in open source that I think the most inane conversation could potentially inspire and catalyze the most amazing creative ideas in a developer. That is to say, anyone on Earth could be responsible for helping the solution be found by simple talking about the problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:53:08
same boat with binance, but I've waited 15 hours so far and 0/3 confirmations 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:07:41
That actually does help. . . if nobody disputes the transaction then why would it need to be confirmed hundreds of thousands of time around the world!
I did have a similar parallel thought, where I wondered why shop owners would insist on X numbers of verifications in order to avoid double spending, because the statistical likelihood of someone knowing and wanting to double spend is probably extremely close to 0%
Just like how I can hand cash to someone to buy chips and they don't necessarily run the bill under a black light to make sure it isn't fake, there is inherit trust. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:56:12
Are you being serious? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:39:39
Thank you! In regards to the LN video, I'm still confused. When a payment channel is closed, who pays the mining fee? 
And I still don't see how this will solve scaling issues, because you're going to have people closing channels in order to recover surplus balances. Like if you have a channel with McDonalds, a coffee shop, pizza place, clothing store, ect, you're going to have unspent money in all those places. 
I'll look into Schnorr and MAST!
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:01:33
I wish people realized they're being rude when asking how many Bitcoin you have. Like fuck that's rude. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:59:59
Well I already did do something stupid. I had too many coins on an exchange and transferred one to the wrong wallet because tired : /

On the exchange however it says cancelled, so is there a chance the reversal address is controlled by them? 
These damn exchanges will take several days to get back to me so I'm just looking for some hope on Reddit!

Transaction fees are adjustable, so some businesses may position themselves to deal with Blockchain micro transactions en masse in order to still profit. Similar to a dollar store.

The FBI owns the most Bitcoins out of everyone and I believe they only have around 1%. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 14:27:29
It is a factor of sheer quantity. . 
@_date: 2014-09-04 22:42:52
If it were heavily discounted it could be worth it. I think it's a bit foolish to drop a few grand on books from MIT when Bitcoin could triple in value a year from now, also textbooks depreciate faster than a biscuit raft. No chance of recouping even 50% of that money. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 11:12:39
You know he means the act of trying to block Bitcoin will have an opposite affect and instead attract more people to Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:57:14
This is great news but it kind of irked me he kept saying "digital currency" when he should have been saying crypto-currency.
Technically we already use digital currency, I pay my utilities through online banking, I never touch cash, it's all digital.

I have every intention of starting a food truck and accepting as much Bitcoin as possible. My ultimate goal is to build strong relationships with people who provide me food from around the world, like say for instance an organic cacao farm in Peru. I could send them Bitcoin donations, and in turn build a strong relationship with them, get higher quality product over time, get priority if there is a shortage, maybe even have a place to visit for vacation.

I find what China is doing to be very interesting. For all we know their motives could be just, these exchanges could be insolvent through corruption. 
I think our perceptions of the Chinese government's are skewed, for the corruption in their system is different than the corruption in ours. They very well may be taking the correct steps to protect Bitcoin, for through inaction the public could lose faith in Bitcoin if everyone were to lose their money and to be defrauded. 
The fact remains, China is made up of millions of intelligent individuals. Collectively I think it is most probable they will prevail over a minority who wish to exert control in the wrong areas. Bitcoin is open source, the blockchain is public, everyone can see it for what it is. It would be most unreasonable to assume the Chinese for whatever reason, can not see a good thing when it is right in front of them.

How can you hire someone from another country and makes small payments to them throughout the day as they complete tasks not using bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-09-14 08:52:04
There is no such thing as direct deposit at the end of the day, this never happens with conventional payment types. The point of sending micropayments throughout the day is that it is more modern, and you can make a quick couple bucks right exactly when you need to. Don't have money and need food? If you're savvy, do some support tickets and buy yourself dinner. Plenty of tickets do not involve the exchange of private info and are just basic questions anybody can answer.

You don't have to understand Bitcoin to support it. Anyone who has ever had their wages garnished, or assets froze, or has been foreclosed on, or has been audited, would likely be optimistic towards a decentralized system.

You must understand, the only thing I need to do is convince someone nearby to delivery the pizza for Bitcoin. It's that simple. I pay the person, it confirms, he orders the pizza and delivers it. 
You can do it in a multitude of ways, even in some instances you can buy a pizza directly with bitcoin in person by simply using your phone. If a person running a business wants to accept bitcoin as payment, there is no hurdle. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 17:55:59
No idea why you have this opinion. I can buy anyone a pizza anywhere with bitcoin, it isn't always a smooth and easy process but there is always a way to do it. 
If you have bitcoin and need to pay taxes on something, then you can liquidize your bitcoin and pay for it. You're not stuck in Bitcoin mode or anything.

Cool so all Valve has to do is talk to Reddit CEO's about me being removed from should they feel like it. 
I think the moderator hierarchy thing is stupid, but you need to change that moving forward, you can't retroactively bully everyone. 
I moderated for over a year, and I can tell you it was a waste of time. I may have helped countless people, but at the end of the day it was taken away from me and that was that. It was not the community that wanted me gone, it was the moderator who had a bit of seniority. That was it, it was pure time allotted that made him more powerful than me.
My advice is never be under someone's thumb unless you know them well and can afford to lose what you have. what I'm saying is, go make your own community on reddit, that way nobody can take it away from you once you pour time in.
