The fact that this kind of tool (New Relic, etc, ...) have no place in published tools.
The fact that it can technically auto-inject event attachment easilly lead me to share my finding. 
Apologize if I confused you. 
I'm referering to this page :
 and the website is not under version control so it is not possible for me to provide a commit link on Github. 
I do not pretend it was used for key logging. I just pretend that zero-knowledge security failed. 
It just rely on goodwill of many, many actors in that particular case.
Don't underestimate the audience and the importance of the address derivation tool. It's a very important topic for any user.

Third party injection makes me very scared. 
It's ~210% inappropriate by the time you should: 
- short NEWR.K, 
- stop shill for free.
- watch your language,

New relic is a Key logger, a great one !
Edit: I do not pretend it was used for key logging
The point: Great to make zero-knowldge security but what if at the end you get a key logger tool in the recovery tool. Security works with modesty.

You are being so fed up, defending  3rd party javascript injection as normal, defending user spying  (and possibly much more) in a recovery tool as normal,  ... you make me laugh.
Idiocy is to argue that it has been added by an unknown, uncontrolled third party is an excuse.
Idiocy is to argue that's normal.
As a software developer you should be aware that continuous delivery and reproductible build, can mitigate the risk of unversionned content on your delivery website/blog and understand what a security perimeter is. Tons of hack comes from this.
I perfectly understood that it's paradoxal to develop software aimed at privacy for at the end having a strong user tracking tool (a minima) in a recovery tool. Liked the paradox.
So much fed up reactions &amp; lack of modesty give me idea on the root cause of the problem. 
That's my point, it's nice to know how to use Mike Hearn's works (Android SPV implementation) but we have to build teams that have strong human values othewise leak rate will increase, you being so fed up with this is an example implementation of the process.
