hi UNsTephenik, we are not expecting this to be a business/to make profit, as everyone starts an online tshirt store, its just super saturated. we are just doing this for fun and to meet more ppl in the bitcoin community in berlin. but maybe it works differently for you (we arent very business minded lol) 
lets keep in contact, feel free to pm me :-)

i know what u mean. i used to go on the bitcoin forum but stopped aaround 2013, because it was a bit repetitive and focusing mostly on speculation etc. (although Hodl was kinda good)
I don't know about segwit, going to check it out!

hi there, yeah we know its on the higher side. The reason is that we are handmaking the silkscreens and also we choose quite pricey high quality shirts to start with, that are organic/bio cotton and not made in sweatshops. We don't envisage to make any profit actually with this shop, but thought it would be a fun way to incorporate cryptos and also make some fun designs.   Also every shirt will be limited to 100 editions only.  thanks for your  feedback, much appreciated

"- for those apartments where owners installed new technology doors, that can be opened ONLY with the BTC address that was paying the booking. I know it is already developed this but I can't find right now the links."
that sounds amazing! i got to know more about this

Hi guys, so I just wanted to say thanks for all the comments. It wasn't our intention to cause any controversy/bad feelings or to profit, so we will take the shirt down, and make some better designs.  if anyone else has any other comments we totally welcome them, and want to listen to what you have to say.

thanks for feedback, its actually really helpful.  I just wrote above that we'll not sell this shirt anymore. peace

Hmm interesting view, I do agree it would be cool for micropayments, perhaps another coin could do that? i think Doge might have tried or be in the process?  
The future, as I see it is in really clever uses of the blockchain, such as the Berlin startup I listed above Ascribe, which is really great for digital content creators (don't worry I dont work for them or promote them, honestly!) As I'm in the arts, I also like Cointemporary.com and Left gallery which both use ascribe and bitcoin, and are digital arts based.
What exactly do you mean about developments being on hold? Sorry if its a dumb question, I havn't really followed btc developments so much in the last year, outside of the art field.
