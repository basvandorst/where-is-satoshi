So is bitconnect not dead? Wtf
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:32:31
Dont get cocky till we're established lol

So receiving bitcoin cash is taxed or only the act of selling it?

Hopefully it stays dormant in 2018 tbh. Itll lose media attention and come back flying 2019 unsupported by hype.

I agree. A lot of people on the outside think its a major bubble, so theres that
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:07:33
You know what? Youre right. Hopefully there's a true mania that's just about to start.

Honestly i think its possible. I mean targeted ads play with our sentiment. Whats to stop fake profiles that swarm in a same way to fuel any type of agenda.

Atm machines always mark up the price by a lot. At least the ones I've seen :/

Remember when Bcash went live and pumped? History repeats itself. This is just another stronger attack. Hodl

Sunday i believe @ 5pm
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:32:45
They probably hold both though.

What happens when bitconnect goes down?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:12:35
Interesting-  I live in the US. Couldn't find a minimum though
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:21:28
Its at extremes i think. Either its horrible bashing, or people over hyping it. Thing that bothers me on Social media and certain news outlets, is that it seems like people just randomly comment to buy crypto. Like in completely unrelated articles. I'm talking kids, people that look like gang members, and so on. Its stressful.

When the shoeshine gives boy gives you investment advice... Idk seems like every kid is promoting this
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:46:07
We need a good crash

Had an issue where a big transaction had to be reversed by my bank for fradulent use. How can bitcoin help with something like this in the future?
