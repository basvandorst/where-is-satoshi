Here’s another one of things not to use.... About three months ago I deposited XZC into the Cobo wallet for iPhone, and then placed it into their rewards program.  Recently I tried to move the XZC out of the rewards wallet but was greeted with “your withdrawal capabilities may be limited. Please confirm before deposit”. I contacted support they informed me that I needed level 3 authentication to make withdrawals. I found this odd as I was able to deposit without any limitations. Anyhow I complied and achieved level 3 only to find out that I still could not access my funds. Contacted support again they agreed to put the funds back into my regular wallet. That never happened. They ignored my support requests for 72 hrs was only until I went to their telegram channel and got their attention, they opened the ticket again and was asked “ ok what was the problem again”  I let them know again what the problem was and they’ve completely ignored me now not answering any support tickets and have stopped using telegram. Basically BEWARE COBO REWARDS WALLET

I would try a test amount first just to make sure , you know you can't get it back if you send to wrong place

Takes one confirmation to show and two to be deposited. You can also follow your transaction with a block explorer

I’ve worked nearish there. Bout a hundred km south west west of Churchill Manitoba. No roads going in, accessible by plane to larger communities, the rest is snowmobiles and dog sled territory and boat if the waters aren’t frozen. These are all Inuit communities. Sad that the Canadian government went up there and disturbed these people
