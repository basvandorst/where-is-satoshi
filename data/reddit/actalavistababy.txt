Hi, mercenaries are not necessarily evil or good, humanitarian or not. They just work for money. Why not pay them to work for a good cause? We could also set some constraints to not allow big pockets funding evil causes, like maximum amount of donation per user. And downvotes/upvotes so users could veto a bad cause regardless of the funding it receives.

I wasn't really thinking in a murder market: where different parties place bets on the date of death of a given individual. I am not thinking in even murdering anyone. I am thinking of crowd funding private armies to go and do humanitarian missions that require military power, e.g. kidnap [Omar al-Bashir]( and bring him to the International Criminal Court (ICC).
I would introduce some restrictions:
* Set a maximum allowable funding per user to avoid big pockets funding projects that benefit them e.g. Oil companies funding rebels somewhere to murder local civilians to take control of the land.
* I am not sure in how to avoid [moral panics]( and [
mob rule]( I was thinking of some sort of veto process where if a certain number of users veto down a project, that project will not be accepted regardless of the funding it receives. Or introduce two voting phases with a 1 month freeze in between the phases to allow people to calm down from a moral panic? Any ideas are welcome.
EDIT: forgot to put url link for Omar al-Bashir

Hi, I wouldn't make it a betting market. More a crowd funding market (like kickstarter) where users could donate an amount for the project. We would also set a maximum allowable funding per user to avoid big pockets to fund projects that benefit them.

It's sad that we have to make petitions to our corporate overlords to alter their proprietary software that live in our locked-in devices.

Does this scare anyone? Bitcoin being eclipsed by a non-anonymous centralized virtual currency.

Another also big win would be [OpenNIC]( It seems that they are already looking into this in namecoin forum: [here](

Even if it were Fox News or even Bill O'Riley or Adolf Hitler speaking, we shouldn't judge this report by who is reporting but by its content.
