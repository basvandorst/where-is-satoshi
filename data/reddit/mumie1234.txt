you will regret it if you do. Once it races back up you will say to yourself 'wow, this is what i pissed my pants for?' Have more trust!
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:21:32
The floppening!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:48:28
it's almost midnight in Germany, and i grabbed some popcorn.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:58:34
yea, why not?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:24
since i'm responding to your question two hours or almost $1000 later, i don't even need to tell you the answer.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:06:41
yep! It were some very historcal 50 seconds...
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:37:16
This is happening right now btw.
Share if you got some good ones!
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:47:44
chill out, dude!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:54:24
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:19:15
ist's over i think...
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:26:38
i always get this when i try to log in, and since i have a 30 character password and two-way authentification this  really is a pain in the butt...
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:17:58
no worries, it will go back up, it is nor the first time this happened and when you think of it percentage-wise, its definitely not the most severe drop, but maybe wait a little longer before buying though
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:58:00
The whole day was an ATH
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:33:59
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:37:04
Dude, that's like asking if we remember the time before the internet. Move on with your life!
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:12:56
and i don't even have BTC right now!
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:26:17
This is Kraken's very effective anti-sell feature
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:42:57
And there is no cure for it!
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:15:15
expect millions 8-)
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:11:08
how much is a 2012 address worth? I deleted the wallet.dat from my USB drive recently but i would go through all the recovery programs if it's a reasonable amount.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:18:37
every second 
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:18:00
no worries, i bought @ 13k in 2017
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:55:15
 Nullius In Verba
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:40:59
i misread ATH for ETH, imagine spending all that time watching bitcoin and then realizing that you have all your funds in Ethereum...
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:40:46
Why not BitCash? Would make more sense.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:23:53
i wonder how, i wonder why, yesterday you told me bout the blue blue sky...
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:31:19
i also suspect that there might be a second BCH wave so it might dip a little deeper.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:20:10
imagine the last accessible Bitcoin worth $100.000.000.000...
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:52
and I wonder.
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:13:55
I'll give you back 10.001 btc once my work, i promise!
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:42:06
in my childhood, every time my tamagotchi pet was going to die, i just reset it by putting the small plastic strip that protects the battery from getting empty before you buy it back in the small slot.
@_date: 2019-04-02 07:42:04
When i went to bed last night i thought 'nothing happened to the price for a long time, maybe i should set an alarm if the price drops again this night'... Well i didn't really need that alarm
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:51:54
well, then i'll make my own RCG right now :D
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:03:22
About fucking time!
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:47:22


right now it is more like the waterfall of wasted money..
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:11:04
This and also the ton of new members that will get verified soon.
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:01:01
They need money quick to buy the new iphone.
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:05:55
Damn, you could be holding a hot woman and now you're holding shit!
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:02:43
should you be getting gold now?
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:59:35
So should we buy more then? This seems counter-intuitive
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:26:41
Yep, and i will buy more! I always think of this in the way that if this really happens, i have done everything right in my life financially. I don't even regret buying earlier anymore.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:03:22
About fucking time!
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:20:30
Guys, chill! Nothing will happen. I even bought more.
edit 1: $4360
edit 2: $4450
edit 3: $4650
edit 4: lol
@_date: 2017-09-07 07:04:02
There are 21m Bitcoins max which some of them are not even mined yet. That means that on this platform alone, each of those members could only obtain less then 2 BTC. I think there will be a BIG increase of the price again once their payments arrive and they all try to buy.
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:54:01
Same here bro! Bought a fair amount.
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:41:26
You can also pay me in BTC :D
@_date: 2017-09-06 10:01:37
hes probably mad that he didn't make money off the dip because he ignores all those meme posts.
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:47:44
Who would sell all his coins before the great Coinbase rush?
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:59:10
don't worry, i bought at 4620.... Also, it was first ever buy (0.5 BTC) so i don't expect very much
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:47:22


right now it is more like the waterfall of wasted money..
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:00:46
yep, those old  rollercoasters had very loud and intense clacks that were really scary but as time went on, those clacks were getting more and more silent and smooth :))
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:08:48
That is good!
