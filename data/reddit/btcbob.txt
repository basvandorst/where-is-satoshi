I mainly agree that BTC is better than BCH, curious to hear feedback:

Great question!
The bitcoin mining reward is effectively a type of inflation of the money supply.  Inflation has the benefit of encouraging people to spend and not hoard. In the US economy, the money supply inflation rate is set indirectly by the Federal Reserve by adjusting the overnight lending rate between large banks and by selling "treasury bonds" (billion dollar IOU's written to the US taxpayers). In a Bitcoin economy, the mining reward could theoretically be suggested by an independent body that made predictions about the economy, unemployment, etc. It would be up to the miners whether or not they heeded the advice of the committee. At some point, disagreement about whether or not to raise the mining reward might be so strong that Bitcoin would fork into 2 versions! I think large miners would want to avoid the perception that they are taking too large a reward, but miners would also want to encourage people to spend Bitcoins and not hoard. So some inflation is healthy, but too much might make people skeptical. In the short-term, miners like myself don't want to stir the pot too much by trying to introduce increased mining rewards or "raising the cap." Bitcoin is complicated enough as it is, and deflation is mainly caused by people speculating. However, I am curious how this will play out in the long run! It is quite possible that the cap will be raised in a decade or so.

you probably need support of your ISP for this, which is why i suggest a police report
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:04:40
The police could in theory get the ISP to hand over logs of IP traffic to be able to pinpoint the VPN end-point. Of course fruitless if there's TOR or something, but seems worth a shot to me.

Look at the swell in orders from other companies that have started accepting Bitcoin

Well, holding Bitcoins makes sense if you think it will gain market share. Once the perception becomes that Bitcoin has saturated its target markets (some would argue that is the case already), then people will start shedding them. Smart investors don't hold cash, they make their money work for them by investing.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:35:06
Your argument lacks depth
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:05:59
Bitcoin money supply inflation (caused by mining) will eventually taper off due to the magic 21 million coin number, at which point I predict that an alt-coin (maybe a Bitcoin fork) will increase the mining rate to have a larger money supply inflation rate. The miners would become just like the bank, and could lend their Bitcoins to entrepreneurs with the goal of gaining a return on their investment. The difference between the current system and this system is that the ability to print money goes to whoever has the most energy efficient Bitcoin miner, instead of whoever has the best political ties with the central government.

This reminds me of a story. In WWII, the Japanese Zeroes were faster and more maneuvarable than the American fighter planes. However, if a Japanese plan (made of wood) was hit by a bullet in the gas-tank, it would catch fire. The "failure is not an option" approach. The American planes were designed with rubber gas bladders, and could take a lot of bullets without crashing. So the Americans used a "getting hit is an inevitable part of war" strategy, which proved more succesful. This strategy even manifested itself to the point where American planes would fly in pairs, as soon as they were engaged, one plane would break off, and the other would be the bait plane. Together, the 2 American planes would take out Japanese planes, known as the "Thach weave" maneuver. In my head, American design is usually rugged, with failure in mind.

I sent this, feel free to copy/modify it: 
Dear Mr. Manchin,
I read your open letter regarding Bitcoin with much disappointment. Bitcoin is the first system in existence that can cut out the middle-man in consumer transactions between merchants and banks, currently mediated by middle-men like VISA and Mastercard. Bitcoin therefore has the potential to save businesses and consumers ~2% on each transaction (currently collected by VISA). For small-margin businesses like grocers, electronics, retail, etc, this is a huge potential boon to their profit margins.
I want to correct a number of errors in your letter. First: "Bitcoin has also become a haven for individuals to buy black market items." Well, US dollars are still the preferred medium of exchange for drug lords, but I am not suggesting that we ban USD.
"it has been banned in two different countries—Thailand and China." Correction: China has clamped down on currency exchanges, as a protectionist measure to try to limit wealthy Chinese citizens who aim to move their money abroad, but it is still legal to hold Bitcoins in China. You should be encouraging a means for Chinese investors to move their money into American markets! This will improve the US economy greatly. The largest buyer of Bitcoins at the moment is China, you can see that in real-time here:  If anything, I think America is falling behind in buying Bitcoins, and this may hurt America in the long-run.
"I am most concerned that as Bitcoin is inevitably banned in other countries, Americans will be left holding the bag on a valueless currency." It is far from inevitable that Bitcoin is banned in other countries. Some countries have embraced the potential savings to consumers as a net benefit for society, and have started to create clear legal frameworks for taxation of Bitcoins, such as Germany and Canada.
"As of December 2013, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) shows 1.3% inflation, while a recent media report indicated Bitcoin CPI has 98% deflation." This is a ridiculous number, I have no idea where you pulled it from. The current Bitcoin money supply inflation rate can be derived from the mining rate:  It is currently around 10%.
"The clear ends of Bitcoin for either transacting in illegal goods and services or speculative gambling make me weary of its use." The clear ends of Bitcoin to me are to save businesses and consumers money that otherwise goes into VISA's pockets.
I can understand your concern with money laundering, taxation, and cybercrime, but I want to ensure you that the benefits to society are immense. Legitimate businesses are accepting Bitcoins at incredible rates. You can see the geographic distrubution of companies that accept Bitcoins here: coinmap.org. The only logical reason I can see for you to oppose Bitcoins is if you hold shares in VISA corporation, or are accepting campaign contributions from Mastercard. As a Democrat, I encourage you to support technological advances that support small businesses, such as Bitcoin.
I hope my letter can help inform you of the potential benefits of Bitcoin on society as a whole. Sincerely,

I'm not talking about reading the data stream I'm talking about pinpointing the endpoint of the Teamviewer VPN by tracing the IP address... maybe impossible as some have suggested if the hacker scrambled the IP, but maybe not...

I think there are going to be more and more cases like yours in the future, probably the FBI is eager to start testing their methods of tracking down cybercriminals like the one that stole your coins. Perhaps there is someone at the FBI that is just waiting for a case like yours to use their new method of catching the criminal. Perhaps that's optimistic, but you never know... give the police and FBI a chance to do a great job.

Terrible idea. Just switch to micro-BTC if needed, and then nano-BTC. A Satoshi (10^-8) is currently the smallest divisible unit, but this may well change in future versions of Bitcoin.

Nice idea to compare the 2, but you used a linear scale which makes the Bitcoin curve appear flat since it's so low in magnitude. I would like to see this graph on a log scale, to see if the growth rate of Bitcoin adoption will ever catch M-Pesa.

To be a successful investor, you need to have some insight into the future. It sounds like you have a vague idea that Bitcoins will be valuable in the future, but you have not really worked this out into a rational valuation ($1000+ is a round number?). To be a successful day-trader, you need to have a better grasp of short-term fluctuations than all other day-traders, since it's a zero-sum game. This grasp I speak of includes manipulating the market, possessing insider information, having probabilistic strategies with hedged futures contracts, market-making, etc. It sounds like you have neither long-term-vision nor short-term abilities. Get out now. Buy a diverse group of mutual funds and bonds and be happy if you get 5% annual returns. In short-term-trading you will get destroyed by people that have brains and are using those brains to out-think you and take your money.

You could apply similar logic to show that private keys will not be broken by brute force using standard computers. I don't know how much quantum computers would theoretically speed up the process.

You have not backed it to the full market capitalization, only to some trivial amount. I would call this an option, rather than backing of the currency. For backing of Bitcoin with Euros, you'd need enough euros to cover all possible sales.
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:33:31
What you are doing is the crudest form of a futures (options) exchange: promising something the option to trade bitcoins for euros at some point in the future (although you didn't specify a date). You could have sold this option. If I wanted to buy it, I would have to trust that you would pay up. Unfortunately, without trusted parties, I don't see how this concept is scalable. The point of bitcoins is decentralization without the need for trusted third parties, so I'm still not sure how futures exchanges will work. So basically what you have done is highlight the difficulty of creating a futures exchange without a trusted party.

That backwards logic is the reason why the Imperial system still exists
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:37:17
That is a problem with credit cards. However, this idea of having commercials that link to QR codes, although good, is not specific to Bitcoins. It's like saying "here's my idea, use Bitcoins to buy beer." While that may be a good idea, it does not leverage the advantages of Bitcoin. Saying "a company that manages Bitcoins for low-margin businesses like online electronics retailers" is a great idea. It's called BitPay.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:42:09
Your analysis is correct if $50,000 and $0 valuations are the only possible outcomes. However, they are not. "We are in a binary position..." is just wrong. It's possible for Bitcoin to still be at exactly the same valuation it is at today in one year's time. Another possible outcome is $40,000. Another outcome is $10,000. Another is $100. The weighted average of all of these valuations (weighted by their probability) is the market valuation. So add up $50,000x0.000001 + $40,000x0.000002 +... If the number you come up with is higher than the current bitcoin valuation (with some factor to account for the time-value of money), then you have deemed the market to be too conservative, and you should invest in Bitcoin. If you deem the market to be too aggressive, you should short-sell Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:37:44
your sentence is confusing because the phrase "the same thing" seemingly applies to the previous sentence. So your last sentence reads "good luck convincing governments to make Bitcoin illegal when it comes to Bitcoin." Just some grammar tips for you :D
@_date: 2014-03-31 06:14:17
Bitcoin inflates its money supply by mining. The inflation rate will probably adhere to the Satoshi rules that decrease the mining rewards over time, but in the future there could be a soft fork if a majority of miners agree to increasing the mining reward.

Tragic, but maybe here is some advice:


Obviously you should file a police report, and gmail (or an ISP) can get access to the IP address that accessed your gmail account. Perhaps they were stupid enough to access it without Tor or something, and if that's the case then you can find the physical address of the person that hacked you and perhaps bring them to justice.
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:22:11
There are physical limitations: 
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:04:33
This idea is cool, but I don't see why you need Bitcoin. Couldn't you just hook up your credit card to it? I think the community needs to focus on ways of making merchants excited about the 2% savings by cutting out VISA/Mastercard from retail/online transactions. Then merchants will try to think of clever ways to get more customers. The 2% savings is really the added value of Bitcoin, not that it can be interfaced with a smart phone or TV show/commercial.
