The code is owned by blockstream. RBF has been implemented. I've been in bitcoin since 2013 the bankers have control of bitcoin now.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:50:08
I wish this wasn't true my friend. But the gods have spoken to me. I only pass the message.

I got 6 bitcoins at 964USD each sold 3 botcoins at 1084USD each, put the other 3 in my trezor wallet.
Slow money is better than no money.

Click bait. Plus this guy is way overreacting, needs to calm down and watch some dragonball.
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:56:40
Bro i cannot stress to you enough to just buy 1 coin.
Buy 1 bitcoin and HODL, truthfully me personally i invested everything i have in bitcoin in 2012.
I own a car company and every single penny i make i buy bitcoin, it has been the best move i have ever done in my life.
1. Buy bitcoins
2. Buy a trezor wallet
3. Work for paper money and with all your surplus buy bitcoin.
Thats just my opinion anyway, im 25 and in about 3 more years i will most likely be a bitcoin millionaire.
@_date: 2017-02-12 18:21:25
ALWAYS A GOOD TIME.
@_date: 2017-02-12 14:33:50

@_date: 2017-02-20 15:49:56
.... look at the PboC they try bring the price down, and in return bitcoin made an amazing recovery in such a short time.
Please remember bitcoin is the strongest currency in the world let that sink in.
@_date: 2017-02-08 05:02:02
Amazing article.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:55:47
Doesn't matter 
@_date: 2017-02-12 17:32:28
I believe we have reached a period of stability depending on how you look at it.
Compared to a few years back i beleive bitcoin is becoming more and more stable.
Look at that recent dip we had due to the PboC, then look at the amazing recovery it made in such a small time.
The most volatile periods are now a memory we look back at and laugh.
Bitcoin is natural growth, in the short amount of time it has come into existence it is now the most strongest currency in the world.
It is liable to change rapidly and unpredictably but not as much as before. We are entering a beautiful era in the crypto world, jump on the ship with me and lets go mars.

Ticket price is 1 bitcoin, you can buy tickets in loads of places just do some research.
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:50:23

@_date: 2017-02-06 13:56:55
Invest everything u can afford to invest. But bitcoins and hold till 2020. Dont be scared of the fluctuations of bitcoin you will always have the last laugh in the end. Put all your coins in a trezor wallet and wait.
Dont look at it as an investment, look at it as your believing in a world where bitcoin will be used all over.
Your always winning you can never loose with bitcoins.  ONLY LOSS IS IF YOU ARE A SHORT TERM TRADER.

@_date: 2017-02-12 18:21:07
Name 1 risk to bitcoin that will knock its price down by $200.
Risky was couple years back, look at the recovery since PboC. You have more risk holding dollars, bitcoin is the most expensive currency in the world.
@_date: 2017-02-14 22:18:45
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:52:57
We need more of this.
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:45:07
It recovered. When did it drop again below 1000 ?...
After the PboC announcement it regained all losses made it never dropped again.
@_date: 2017-02-11 11:59:52
Stay safe bro. A lot of hungry people out there....
@_date: 2017-02-15 22:55:58

This guy is a troll. Dont take his word serious.
@_date: 2017-02-15 23:05:10
Real honest answer from someone that has seen the growth from the start, 150k-400k per bitcoin with 50k-80k dips. In 2020 it will be 20k for 1 bitcoin, if u look at the charts do the correct calculations you get your answer.
@_date: 2017-02-19 17:21:57
Ive never laughed so hard in my life, i laughed so hard dropped my phone and to smashed. Well worth it tho.

@_date: 2017-02-23 02:44:07
Never. Im waiting for the day i can buy everything i need with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-20 17:17:25
I never said it will never drop below 1000USD again, Im simply saying that the recovery bitcoin made since the announcement from the PboC shows that the new norm is 1000USD.
In due time the price will be 1150USD -1300USD and then you will see drops of 100USD - 300USD.
Same thing will happen when bitcoin is worth 10-20k expext 2-5k dips.
I love dips, i buy more on dips.
@_date: 2017-02-12 14:47:00
What happened bro ? GTFOH with your milk bottle advice.

Personally speaking i dont trust any of the exchanges right now they all move funny with large amounts of btc.
Think of your future, the choices you make now can cement yourself a very healthy retirement.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:08:40
I bet they wont let you remove them lol.
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:02:52

whales that support BU are selling to exchanges that also support BU, ANYBODY that has funds on a exchange at risk. 
REMOVE your bitcoins from an exchange and hodl on a safe wallet.

@_date: 2017-05-11 12:46:37
I kept thinking it was a bubble.
Until my peers in Japan said its a buying frenzy over there.
Once china opens back up its trading its going to be insane.
This ain't a bubble i wish it was.
@_date: 2017-05-04 14:48:16
