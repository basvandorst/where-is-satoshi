Yep, that level of growth was not sustainable. 
It was literally breaking projection graphs so a drop was imminent. Really not a bad thing unless you took out a 30,000 payday loan to buy at the all time high. But give it a year or two and hopefully you'll still be happy you got in when you did.

Some wallets are less flexible and don't let you choose a lower fee, some of the fees are charged by the exchange itself. For example with electrums 2FA you get charged a ~$20 fee the first transaction you make with it. 
So I think part of the problem is people unfamiliar with  crypto jumping in and getting hit with service fees in addition to the actual transaction fee and over reacting.

For what it's worth I trust coinbase. It's experience massive growth the past week and just hasn't quite caught up yet. They're a US (San Francisco) based company. They [claim]( to only keep 2% of their funds in "hot" wallets everything else is stored offline in cold wallets. 
FDIC insured for USD deposits but not cryptos. So if they get hacked and they loose "your" bitcoin like Nicehash did it could be gone for good. That being said it's a US based company so the government would probably get involved in an investigation and they'd probably be open to lawsuits and stuff.
If you don't hold the private key's to the coins you don't actually own them. I do think they have much better infrastructure and practices than Nicehash does so I don't think they're vulnerable. But anythings possible.
So I trust them but I don't use it as a wallet, just a trusted exchange and the only one that I'll actually link to my bank account.

It can be hard/impossible to track transactions to physical locations through the block chain. So to my understanding an entity like the FBI would be useless unless they had a suspect, obtained a search warrant, and recovered evidence.
If it was a random Chinese hacker then that money is gone. If it was Scott the IT guy that codes stuff and he didn't cover his steps well enough he could get caught.
But IDK how nicehash is structured as a company. Do they have an office? What country are they even based in? Servers they physically control or was it all left to cloud computing servers and managed by a group through the internet instead of a central office?

You have to deposit money on coinbase then transfer to gdax for free
Again bitcoin has a $40 network fee average so unless you're making a +$5,000 buy I would buy BCH/ETH/LTC instead because of the lower network transaction fees. 
Do your own research.

You can't really with how bitcoin private keys work. 
You'd have to make the payment from a single wallet. Unless who ever you were buy from supported split payments from different addresses. 
Most bitcoin millionaires don't have 30 different wallets. Why would anyone want to manage that many wallets?
Why would they only be able to spend a small amount at a time? They could spend as much as they have in a single wallet at any given time. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:51:36
I just use Electrum wallets for everything, not familiar with mycelium don't know what an HD wallet is.

Nothing. It's a cryptocurrency.
Unless they can prove that an employee stole the Bitcoin I don't think there's anything they can do. And this is sort of a good thing. It backs the anonymity that cryptos are supposed to have and also teaches everyone in the industry a valuable lesson. 
I only "lost" $94 that hadn't been payed out to me yet. Soo close to the ~$130 payout ceiling you need to withdraw to a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:57:15
A 5.8% fee isn't bad at all considering the near exponential growth bitcoin has had.
If you recently bought in and cashed out then yeah that'll cut into your profits. But that's why everyone is saying to hold. 
If you been holding for a year or even 6 months. Meh still made massive profits.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:58:24
You really should take a step back and learn what bitcoin is before you use it. 
If you're sending a bunch of tiny payments to a bunch of different wallets. Send them all to one wallet. And then make a payment from the wallet you're going to have an astronomically high fee from all the input addresses. 
A wallet holds your private keys secure and allows you to receive/send bitcoin.
It is encrypted, password protected, and recoverable with a seed phrase.

@_date: 2017-12-17 22:10:30
The fee's are usually charged per kilobyte of data sent over the network. Sending more bitcoin doesn't significantly increase the size of the transaction.
There can be network fees, wallet fees, and exchange fees depending on what your doing and what program/site you're doing it with.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:11:44
If you have the seed phrase you should be able to recover the whole wallet with whatever wallet software you created it with. Good luck!

Edited my comment. I'm one of those "victims" but wasn't anything I could have done to avoid it. You can't withdraw your mining profits till you get .01 BTC mined and I always pulled the .01 asap. 
Fortunately for me electricity is included in my rent so it didn't cost me anything other than some wear and tear on the GPUs.
They really should have lowed it to .005 or something since BTC has gone up soo much since the miner launched.

Can they actually choose the specific transaction? I know it's weighted by transaction fee's and which makes them the most money but I didn't think you could directly pick and choose an individual transaction.

If you want USD use Coinbase/Gdax 
Why don't you want to use Coinbase? 
Set up Coinbase link it to your bank account. When you're ready to turn your btc to usd just send it to your coinbases receive address. Then withdraw your USD to your bank account. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:04:09
5.8% isn't ideal but in the financial/banking world that's the cost of doing business. 
There are other coins with lower or even zero fees you can use to avoid bitcoins fees. They just aren't valued as high as bitcoin is. 
Do some research before you invest. Don't try to make a quick buck flipping cryptos because the fee's will cut into your profits.
And if you've been in it for the long haul and just cashed out Congrats! The 5.8% fee hurts but all things considered you came out on top and took a nice profit.   
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:45:06

Coinbase is a brokerage. Not an exchange you click buy and you buy btc at the price they set. 
Go onto GDax coinbases exchange and you can set the price you want to pay. 
On the exchange it might take a few minutes or a few weeks for someone to meet you at the same market price. 
If you miss place a decimal or flip two values you could massively over pay and there are no take backs after a trade is finalized. 
The brokerage takes the work out of putting a bid on the market and instantly buys you BTC at that price. It might take a few days-weeks for you to actually get the BTC to your own wallet unless you already have USD deposited. But that's due to bank wire times more than anything else. 
Be aware that bitcoin has a ~$40 network transaction fee per transaction which is completely separate from coinbase. They don't set the fee it's just inherent when using Bitcoin every wallet transfer has a ~$40 fee because the network can only process 3.3 transactions per second.

Wasn't the price that high because of the people trading on Gdax? 
Maybe I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure the market on Gdax is what influences the price on Coinbase and everyone is overreacting.

If you were holding your private keys when the those forks happened congrats you have those coins and can use them.
Are they worth the same as a bitcoin? Nope! 
So nothing is stopping you from using forked coins with lower transaction fee's. They just aren't valued as high.

Either an inside job or a horrifically insecure network.
I guess something as small as a single password on a piece of paper or in plain text on a server with an internet connection could have compromised everything since they apparently held everything in a single wallet (correct me if I'm wrong). Single point of failure failed. Murphy's law.

Well yeah that was 20 btc
A $300,000 transaction with a $1,300 fee. Paid a 0.43% fee which entirely reasonable a steal to be honest. 
Way less than if you did a $300,000 wire transaction through a bank. Especially if it was international.
