Libertyx, Paxful, localbitcoins, bisq
Edit: localbitcoins is ruled out, commentor below has informed me

Great copy-paste by :
If you are looking to Buy bitcoin with fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:
- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?
You indicated that being a minor, your financial privacy is important.
Without an ID, you can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:
- [BitQuick QuickBuy]( [NO KYC (when trx amount is under $400)]
There are also physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:
- 
-  (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](
-  &amp;lt;-- Cashier (cash), and/or Kiosk (debit card)
First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card.  I do not know if they will require ID. (e.g., 247Exchange, CEX.io, Coinify, CoinCorner, Jubiter, Bittylicious, BitIreleand, Cash App and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified. For paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover) there is [CardCoins](
Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange are probably your next best options:
*P2P Trading exchanges*
- 
Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method.  Id verification/KYC is required for most:
- 
There's always the friends and family methods.  Someone you know probably holds bitcoin and would be willing to help you out by selling to you.

You can't believe any one person, but you can place trust in a worldwide system of computers and computing power securing and policing the blockchain to follow all of it's rules. You can even become part of the system and provide your own support equivalent to anyone else (full node). You can read the code (if you like) of the software you run, understand it's rules and watch how it contributes to the global network. That's the art of decentralization.

Bitcoin's lightning network can carry a transaction speed of 100k transactions per second. This is pretty competitive to visa. It still needs work but after technical adaption it can replace alot of electronic payments.
@_date: 2019-08-23 16:35:08
Libertyx just needs phone number. Bisq is good once you have your BTC. Use wasabiwallet as well for security/anonimity.

When the internet was invented, it was designed to be resistant to widespread nuclear attack.  DARPA started the project to ensure communication even if many routing nodes fail. Now a days, a large portion of routing facilities can fail and yet there can still be global communication. Also don't forget that Tesla/spacex is starting complete rivalry to terrestrial communication as well, and other satellite communication methods currently exit. See also: Bitcoin over ham radio
Don't forget as well, if the internet of the world is destroyed somehow, we have much bigger problems than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-05 03:58:52
Didn't see it mentioned, try Paxful. Once you have BTC move to Bisq.
@_date: 2019-10-19 22:57:10
A firewall would ensure that no one else can try and connect to your Bitcoin RPC port, and make sure other ports coming in are restricted. I'd recommend it.

Bisq once you get your starting fund.

Linux is free and has more audits on it's open source cryptographic number generators, meanwhile the windows cryptographic library is not fully open source.  Using Linux would  verify that Microsoft did not tamper with a cryptographic library(Linux crypto library can be verified by source code as opposed to being closed source in windows.) Most would consider this a negligible difference though. If you are storing above 1 Bitcoin I would use Linux.
 Debian Linux would be just fine, and you'd learn things from installing it yourself. Experiment with other OS's if you like. Qubes is cool security option that lets you do offline and online virtual machines on a single PC.
You can also search for a PC with a TPM(trusted platform module). A TPM is a physical chip that assists an OS with cryptographic functions. A TPM has a built in true random number generator, while a software number generator is usually psuedorandom. The differences between modern software generators and a TPM is negligible, and you may opt to use just your OS's generator if you want to verify that a bug in a TPM could not lower entropy(I'm not sure how prevalent or even possible such an issue could be).
Good luck
Edit: to be clear, the only different thing this will cause is how "random" your public and private keys are. Meaning no one can guess them by guessing random numbers or patterns quickly. This is also negligible but with where I believe BTC is going, if you have a single bitcoin or more I'd put more trust into linux's rng
@_date: 2019-08-23 14:51:16
I feel bad for the people that deal with you in person. I'm so sorry for them.

For privacy, also try out libertyX (phone number only) for your initial fund, then go to Bisq(almost fully anonymous).
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:23:56
You can't backdoor math. Numbers can't be produced out of thin air like that. All the math and code is open source and you can go study it for yourself and see that it is not possible in the lifetime of the universe to derive a private key from a public one. Look up a video called Public Key Cryptography with Paint if you want to learn more.
@_date: 2019-10-19 03:39:47
Bisq isn't exactly a single company either - the entire network can vote to elect to approve or deny  arbitration request. This sort of makes the arbitrator the entire bisq network I think- I am not sure if I fully understand it but I feel like this system is better.

@_date: 2019-10-18 03:51:44
I suggest learning Linux and running your node on there -  would be more efficient for this. 
Also, it improves security by moving your node to an open source os - meaning microsoft cant introduce code or a hidden bug to be able to shut you down. Unlikely, but I see it being worth it for nodes.

Just about, sometimes not always conferences though.  Look into IEEE, RFCs, and IETF if you are curious.
@_date: 2019-06-15 02:18:42
This isn't even the first time I replied to you... You should check out this website and do the math yourself. Check your electrical bill, PC wattage, and how many hashs/s your cards produce.  You are very likely loosing alot of money to an electrical bill and mining parts and it's much cheaper to just outright buy it. The most efficient miner (antminer s9 used from eBay)would take me almost 1-2 years to pay back with bitcoin if I was even profitable electricity wise.
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:05:26
Don't have to KYC, there's libertyX, bisq, f2f, localbitcoins, hodlhodl. Bisq is best anonymous solution, although I'd say it's as hard as setting up your miners.
Edit: Paxful is pretty good too

Not a fan of brave since it's just chromium with some add-ons, Firefox has been taking great privacy strides this past year imo. Also has more FOSS support and plans to integrate Tor at some point.
@_date: 2019-06-13 14:55:13
Mining bitcoin is likely not going to pay for the electrical power spent + paying back the miner. At least in op's location. Regardless this method would have to be combined with Tor to actually be anonymous. Just buying BTC will be alot quicker than purchasing a miner. I do fully recommend mining once local electrical costs are eclisped by BTC's price though..

Wouldn't agree with you here, lightning, schnor sigs, makes it very powerful. Some calculations report possibly 100k txns per second, beating Visa's average 1700txns per second just with lighting.

This post is talking about bitcoincash, not Bitcoin. The title is vague. You can say that bitcoincash is a politcal enemy of Bitcoin with some different views and creators.
@_date: 2019-06-15 04:16:25
Sure it's fine if you made profit from long term holding, but again none of us here can predict the market, not have the funds to drop and pay upkeep for mining. For someone who is curious/slightly skeptical in Bitcoin might want to spend alot less initially while they decide.  Paying electrical and equipment bills costs money that the hodler might not have, but maybe they have enough to throw 50-100 dollars down once for it. Right now where I live, I could spend less money and get the same amount of Bitcoin as you if not more. It's definitely a different case where electrical and ASICs are cheap. Someone using graphics cards will better be able to spend 100 dollars on 100 dollars of exchange BTC rather than few dollars of BTC/month from their GPU mine. This is negated with electrical costs and difficulty increases.  
You also could get more Bitcoin depending on your home electrical situation- buying it regularly might just be cheaper-- and therefore more BTC earned for the long term.

You have a point, although, I would say bisq is definitely not a fully centralized system either. Bitcoin carries similar properties anyway. Obviously Bitcoin is less controllable too but there are defined consensus rules that control things like TXN formats, etc. Regardless bisq is the best we have for now, and their development is getting better and better every day. Unless openbazaar is better, I haven't actually researched that
@_date: 2019-12-22 22:28:31
I suggest you further your research. The security deposit is chosen by the creator of the order, and it is used non custodially by both parties. Either party, in the worst case scenario, either trader can voluntarily release all funds to the Bisq DAO decentralized arbitration. The Bisq network elects the direction of an arbitration via the DOA (colored bitcoins). Security deposit is never actually in anyone else's control if the trade goes well. 
Only two entities can control the entire multisig txn, and those two are both of the traders. 
The trade rules are controlled by the DAO through a consensus election as well. You can download the client and vote on these things if you want.
Source code is available.
@_date: 2019-12-25 23:06:15
I see where you are coming from, a human body is a pretty good decentralized system example, but I believe you are sort of looking at the wrong type of centralization here. In an internet sense, most people consider a decentralized system one that has many entities forming a whole operation, rather than one as an owner. You have an interesting view here, but it may not apply to call one system more decentralized over another, as everything needs some sort of intercommunication rules to even work - its how computers can understand eachother, a defined set of rules everyone in the world agreed on [TCP/IP, and IP vs IPX battle in the 1970(?)s].
In your definition of decentralized, its impossible for any networked computer system to be decentralized just because they all need a standard of protocols to even be able to intercommunicate. [TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc]
Because your definition of centralization is quite a bit different from everyone else's, this may be why you are getting downvoted?
@_date: 2019-12-22 23:31:44
I would argue that it is decentralized, as the arbitration rules, security deposit rules, are created on a consensus election that you and I can participate in. 
@_date: 2019-12-24 02:08:00
If you consider bitcoin centralized, what do you consider decentralized? I don't think any internet protocol, or any system for the matter, to work without some sort of communication and file format rules at least.

I would say that more so, the underlying protocol for lighting is established and is currently getting new and interesting updates,but alot of it is command line only. I would say there are very few lightning GUIs available at all (I haven't downloaded one yet unless I get multiple people online recommending a good safe FOSS one). The protocol exists, we just need to port it to our users and make it more idiot proof and easy to use. We shouldn't have regular users opening/closing lightning channels if we want adoption, it may be a bit complex for the average person.
