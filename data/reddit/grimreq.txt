Bernie calls himself a democratic socialist; not sure if that helps clear the confusion.

Only 49% of the world has Internet access:
That's still 3.9 Billion people, for reference. The US only has 325 million people:

Not sure how you can *doubt* my own experience, but OK.    
I didn't enjoy math because it was boring. When I started to program, math became exciting. I also didn't say I was a math genius; I was just speaking to how programming could engage students who don't know about it, because the current curriculum doesn't engage them. A different perspective on math changed how I engaged with it. The idea of attaining a new perspective (regardless of topic) often changes how others understand something.    
If I was exposed to programming earlier than later I would have enjoyed it. Because that didn't happen, I didn't enjoy math. I am not sure how you arrived at your statement about the education in the Western world and your last sentence lost me. No one was forcing to like math? OK?

I sold my Bcash during the *crash* to help incite panic selling.

My issue was that I didn't take when I was up. I had a purpose for the money, life, bills, etc. It wasn't that I was going to lose - I had taken my initial investment. The issue was that I had made *plans.* When Eth dropped hard, I sold some. The next day I would have made more, and more, etc. My plans were still realized, but I lost potential gains. I didn't sell everything, and held most. But I got FUD'd because I am not a robot. But my advice is, don't treat it like it is something. You have nothing, and you don't know what you got till its gone. The banks tried to pave my paradise.....

Understandable question. What I had and have was/is pure profit, I took my investment. I took some around Christmas. When I sold during the crash, I still profited. I asked myself, if this goes to zero, would I be OK with it. The answer was no, and it should have been yes. Because I had made plans for that profit, having NO profit  was a risk I could not take. Granted, I didn't sell everything- I only had plans for X.

At the same time, if math was taught to me in a meaningful way, I would have enjoyed it. I didn't give a shit about how many apples Sally had left after giving Johnny three. In fact, when I first went to college I decided against Computer Science because I was afraid of math; I dropped out because I was bored with college. A few years later, guess who is learning programming and math (me).

I regret nothing, there was no action to take, or mistakes.
You don't actually know that someone who teaches programming in high school would be utterly pathetic. With your view, you could say that science shouldn't be taught because the teachers are pathetic; and maybe they are. But people need perspective, so learning basic Case/Switch or if/Else If statements would help students think logically, no?
