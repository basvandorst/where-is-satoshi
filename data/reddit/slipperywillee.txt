A bank JP Chase, whose business model/control of money analized how much a single Bitcoin costs to mine on 'average'. Funny how they misinterpret information to make BTC look like it has no intrinsic/negative value. The whole while they borrow a Fiat currency from the federal reserve then borrow out 9 times that amount and collect interest on it. Making the 1$ bill being worth negative 9 times its face value. Thinking they can make BTC look worse somehow. What a joke.
Can't wait til this Fiat currency and banks fail miserably, they will being singing the praises of a decentralized system, the whole time trying to figure out how to make money off of it.
It's also funny they government is trying to tax a decentralized system. All I have to say is good luck you morons. This is just like the propaganda they spread about the BTC uses more energy then mining precious metals, the whole country of Argentina, amongst other proposterous energy consomtion claims. When you can easily prove the banking system itself uses more energy, ND it's money isn't worth anything and can be taken from you for no reason. These people are liars and thieves don't listen to their BS.

It's still a Fiat currency, no matter how 'outdated' I was the point still stands. You've complet missed what I was getting at and giving me useless information. Focusing on the one thing you thought I was outdated on. New dollars are still not worth anything and overnight rates don't mean anything to the point I was making. The federal reserve prints money that isn't worth anything. BTC is and will decentralize the banking industry was my point.
