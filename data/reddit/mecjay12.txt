I don't think that's right because the climb to 20 wasn't  quick. It was just kinda following a curve. The big dip right after, maybe. I think it was more of a combination of things. Right about the time of the dip, Coinbase, one of the biggest starter exchanges opened BCH unexpectedly. The launch was a mess and Coinbase has accused of insider trading. It was also a few weeks before X-mas. I think some casual investors pulled their money to cover presents. I believe I also remember an online wallet getting hacked right about then and right on the heals of the NiceHash hack.

Let me rephrase this for you.
"Shouldn't Bitcoin be PoS instead of PoW?"
Common question/opinion. Ethereum is actually switching over to PoS soon. I believe that, yes, if should be. PoW has too much overhead. On the other hand, I mine so I don't want to see every coin and people start using PoS exclusively.

That's the point. Resend the coins that were sent. Since the coins aren't confirmed they are still in your wallet. The software you use might not show them b/c they are pending. Try using another wallet software that shows your unconfirmed coins and resend with that.

If you have that you then it is the recommended GPU. Nicehash is easy to setup: [go to their website]( and download the miner. Enter you BTC address and click run. The 970 will make around $3.50 a day and the CPU will make around $1 a day.

At the moment what would happen is you would check with any other open channels you currently have to see if any connect up with that coffee shop. The idea is that you open a channel to a node so that you can get to random stores, like this coffee shop, and then transact through a chain of nodes. 
Alternatively, if you can't find a chain of nodes to get to the coffee shop, you have the opportunity to become a node. You can open a channel to the coffee shop and become a node. To open the channel you would pay one BTC network fee but you'd want to leave that channel open because then any transaction that goes through you will pay you. After the channel is open, you wouldn't have to pay a fee because you are sending directly to the coffee shop.

Anything you leave on an exchange is subject to the normal issues of having crypto PLUS the issues with having an online account times two because of the potential payout for a successful hack. If you don't have much and it isn't huge to lose, go for it. Any reasonable amount should be put in a wallet (on better yet on a hardware wallet). My number was after $1000 in crypto I bought a hardware wallet. It is all up to the individual, their financial situation, position, and risk tolerance. Anyone who has been in crypto for more than a year has seen or, worse, experienced an exchange or online crypto service take their money (I learned with the Mt. Gox fiasco). You do you man.

If you want if to go through quickly, use a fee of 25. If you don't have a rush, you can do a fee of 5 and get through in a day. If you are really cheap, do 2 and you might still get through in a week.

I am aware. Most miners were unaffected to lightly affected. I lost $100 (that was my unpaid balance). It was the people that held everything in their online wallet (whcih you shouldn't do according to anyone) that were mostly affected. Eitherway, NH is suppose to pay everyone back at the end of this month. I have been mining with them again every since they came back and they have lower payout thresholds and lower fees now. If there was another hack I would lose even less. They are also the best multi-algo miner I have used.

There will be lightning network nodes. The channel is opened with a transaction on the Bitcoin chain then there are lightning transactions hosted on lightning nodes and finally the channel is closed with a second Bitcoin transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:29:34
Ahhh I see. Let me explain an LN node and this will make more sense. An LN node is any address with more than one channel open. It is automatic, trustless, and free (beyond opening the channel). All your open channels are on the network so you DONT need a device.

Forks happen when someone or a group of people think they can make a better coin. They take the Bitcoin code add or change their thing and redistribute it. Not all other coins are forks. Beyond changing the code, the coin also has to adopt/begin with a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain and build off of it.
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:19:13
1) your transactions are forever on the blockchain so if someone shady sends you coins they can see that. They can also see that you send coins out. Now we have the idea of mutiple addresses and such to mitigate this.
2) they couldn't label a specific coin as dirty because coins aren't unique. They could label an address as dirty and not transact with them. Since coins aren't unique though you could send the coins to any other address and essentially launder them.
3) there are services for taking in many people's coins and redistributing them to new addresses so the transactions cannot be tracked. They can be as simple as bots and do it decentrally or so easily that you have a pirate Bay effect with them.
4) yes. As soon as they get the transaction they will see what address sent it and can look up the remaining coins in that address. This goes back to using multiple addresses. They can all be rooted in one private key so you can keep them all together without anyone knowing they are linked. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:40:07
Yes exactly. I support PoS because currently nodes are rewarded. For people that use and want to support Bitcoin it's beneficial to run nodes but I think there needs to be an intensive to run nodes. Mining is kinda wasteful in my mind (even though I benefit from it) and nodes are already required so making the nodes handle transactions seems like the smart move. PoS systems are much much faster to transact and require much less power. Usually PoS systems reward everyone uniformly for running a node (1% annual inflation kinda thing). It gives a good alternative to maximum numbers of coins and a good solution to regular inflation.

@_date: 2018-01-23 03:45:24
Yes. Look at a transaction from Coinbase. They do it all the time. It's just like a normal transaction but with multiple inputs and/or outputs. You can send 10 BTC to one address from 2 addresses in one transaction.

Because Lightning is extremely important to Bitcoin's success...
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:38:18
I don't understand why an exchange would artificially alter one trading pair due to the activity in another trading pair. I may be wrong. If the exchange did that then we wouldn't see the inverse relationship of Bitcoin and Altcoins. The prices of trading pairs are only affected by the users posting orders.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:46:42
So think of it this way. The exchange doesn't have a pool of coins you buy from directly. Exchanges and small amounts of coins here and there for the users to put coins into. When you buy a coin, you are sending your coin/fiat to the user currently controlling the other coin and the do the same with their coin. That means each coin that the exchange has is only listed in one trading pair of the users chose. Since the user can only put that coin up for sale in one trading pair at a time, the exchange doesn't need to remove anything from any other trading pair because the coin sold isn't listed anywhere else.
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:26:58
Yes you can have multiple channels open. Each 2 people but you can send transactions through each other without needing consent so if 2 people open a same channel to the same 3rd person, all three people can send each other coins at will.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:29:54
Kinda, yeah. It is the method of updating Bitcoin. For example, Ethereum had a hard fork to fix a bug that allowed a hack and to roll back the blockchain refunding the coins. This lead to Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Hard forks are usually divisive especially without the "main" development team sanctioning the fork. Since hard forks are used to change the Butcoin code (or update it depending) they can be used to push changes meant to extend the life of the name (eg. Larger coin supply, PoS vs PoW, smaller divisibale units)

You cannot mine BTC with a GPU. Even with free electric, it will wear your GPU out faster than you'd make enough to afford another.
I use NiceHash as well. It's isn't mining but renting your hardware to others so they can mine alternative coins to BTC. This is going to be the easiest thing to do and one of the more profitable ways to mine. You can mess around with mining other coins directly but I find it very tedious.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:15:42
It depends on the attack. Yes, if they got the exchange's keys and emptied a wallet, fiat is safe. If they got a hold of an/some user accounts they they can convert the accounts' fiat to crypto and withdraw that. Overall, don't keep anything on an exchange that doesn't need to be there.
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:38:38
Wait or try to resend the coins. This up coming bit of time is you best bet at this transaction actually going through.
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:42:57
The default time is 2 weeks but nodes can be set higher and can rebroadcast the transaction so there is no exact time. Try to resend the same coins. One transaction with go through and the other will be flagged and invalid dropping from the network.

It's a volitile market. Your friend is right, it common to see the price drop $1k over night and make it all back the next day. It make be some big hedge fund, it may be this, it may be that; Who knows. What is important is to do your homework. Research BEFORE you invest (learn about the currency, how to handle it, what wallet to use, what exchanges are good, etc). Also, don't invest more that you can lose. We see stories of some idiot that sold his house for Bitcoin and got lucky. For all we know, the coin will drop to $0 tonight and the other idiot that sold his house because it worked for the first guy is now homeless.

And that's why ideally you would be connected to a nodes chain that would eventually connect to that Coffee shop. Even if you only want to buy from this place once, leaving the channel open doesn't cost anything but would help create the chain of nodes. That why you would be getting paid to no close the channel, you are completing a chain.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:44:05
It will work but mining BTC with a GPU isn't profitable. You should look into mining an altcoin or a multi-algo mining software (like NiceHash). Mining alts can be very profitable and many of the multi-algo mining programs will pay you in BTC anyways.

No one is looking at global solutions yet (160GB Blocks). LN significantly reduces main chain transactions though. You could load an LN channel with 1 BTC and make 100,000,000 transactions that only hit the main chain for 2 transactions. Sure the larger and one time transactions won't see a huge change unless LN nodes get big. 
If LN nodes get really big LN could become a global solution. People would be able to pay anyone in the world from their channel open with a node. This may reduce main chain transactions to 2011 levels.

I have one problem with your theory: BCH is crashing with everything else. I think this is more just a result of the Coinbase fisasco than an attack.

On the other hand, my tokens, not traded on Coinbase, are going to the moon ATM. I think this is just the market passing the Coinbase stone.

Miners that complete a block get a coin rewards AND the transaction fees attached by users sending the transactions just mined. As the coin reward goes down (halving till 0) the value of a coin usually goes up to compensate. Eventually when all the coins are mined, miners will rely solely on transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:00:53
Starbuck can open channels with no coins in them. They also don't have to open a channel to every customer. LN allows sending payments through a connected chain of users. What I see happening is nodes will open that do nothing but connect users to many companies. A company would one a connection to one of the nodes and an individual would connect to a node then a bunch of nodes are connected allowing you to spend you channel at every store.

So all coins are stored on the blockchain. What makes a wallet secure/yours is whoever has the private key can send coins. You can only send the coins with the private key. Coinbase has the private keys to their wallets and you don't so they have full control of the coins. If you both had the keys then you could hold coins both on and off the site but that's not really fesible.

As for taxes, you are supposed to report and conversion of currency for gain or loss (capital gains tax). In your case, you would record what it cost you to obtain the currency (the price of the product/service you sold) vs what you sold the coins for (cashing out) and report that. If the coins goes up while you we holding on to it you made some more money than expected but have to pay tax on it. If the coins go down you can write it off. If you convert it quickly and it's exact you don't have to worry.
Bitpay has a card you could use for the business that you load with Bitcoin and spend as USD or you could use an exchange site like most individuals (ex. Coinbase.com)

No. You would be taxes on each trade. There isn't enough information to give you a number for your example. If we remove the word "traded" and assume that you make one purchase on each exchange and one sale for 10k at the end. In this case you owe gains tax. You sold 1/3 of your current value. It originally cost you 10k/3 or $3333. Your gain is $6667. You pay short term gain if these trades happened less than a year apart or long term gains (lower percent) tax if the trades we're longer than 1 year apart.

The AMD one is just the old unsupported one so for nVidia or CPU go with the nVidia one. NiceHash pays in BTC and only pays once you reach .001 BTC so you might be at it a minute before you actually get any coins.

The way a hard fork works is at a point in time everyone who has one coin gets an equal amount of a new coin. If you had 1 BTC on Aug 1st then you got 1 free BCH. This is so that a new version of a coin can be pushed out an no one loses coins and instead gets to pick which coin they want to continue using.

If you send a transaction it has 2 weeks in the mempool before it drops. So long as it even tually goes through you are fine. If it drops or you had any coins left in the wallet they are gone as far as I know.

You can still have debt with Bitcoin just in a different way. For example, people with coins can loan to those without, pools of people could form to loan money out, or the companies selling the product can extend the credit without having to have the currency.

Hardware wallets give you the ability to hold multiple currencies (4 at a time, 25(?) all together). Hardware wallets are also live or, you can remove coins without compromising the keys (the keys say on the HW for a transaction where as a paper wallet has to scan/enter the key.)

I believe that it trys to take the cheapest (least hop) route to the destination. If you have enough in your channels to cover a given transaction and it's less hops to use you than two big pools, you'll be used. I could be wrong but this is my current understanding.

The more nodes the better. More nodes means faster downloads for new nodes. If Net Neutrality gets repealed, more nodes means less data being used by your node, etc. 
More importantly, decentralization, the big idea behind Butcoin, means you can be your own bank, run your own node, be an equal user if the network. I don't want to have to trust bug businesses, governments, and the rich to run nodes and keep my money safe; I do that now!
The other issue associated with larger blocks is the transaction fee issue. I know you did ask about this but they go hand in hand. Larger blocks is only a temporary fix to transaction fees. Implementing technoloies that better utalize block space PERMINANTLY reduce transaction fees and keep nodes decentralized. These tech are just all around the better solution.

Think about it, that means the blockchain can not increae in size 8 times faster. The Blockchain is currently 145GB. as it keeps growing and requires more resources less and less people will want to/be able to dedicate the resources to running a node. There was already dropoff because you can't run a node on a raspberry pi anymore without a huge SD card or network storage. As less home run nodes, the nodes will become central to the big companies and mining pools.

For a single transaction if doesn't make sense to open a channel. LN solves this with chains. If you have a channel open to a mutual friend by chance then you can send the garage saler coins and the network handles the rest. The network will send your coins to the mutual friend then forces the mutual friend to send those coins to the garage saler. This is done without extra consent from the mutual friend and even without their knowledge.
How does this play out on a larger scale? LN nodes will have fees lower than the main network. This will drive people people to make nodes that have tons of channels open soully for connecting to other nodes and eventually any random person or store you go to.

So for Bitcoin you, the sender, are in charge of amounts for transactions and most reputable companies would have a way to send coins back if you over pay.
In other coins, like Ethereum, there are smart contracts which I could see tieing into package tracking to prevent scams.
I guess the answer to your question is we aren't getting rid of the middle man, we are replacing it with math and tech in the network.

Raising the block size is like raising the debt cieling in the Government. Sure right now you have money to spend (more transaction bandwidth) but it isn't free and will still need to be paid back in the future (the already 145GB blockchain will now grow that much faster). Larger blcokchain means more centralization of nodes (those who can afford to pay for the hard drive space and network bandwidth remain while many home nodes fall off). I follow the tech approch. Using techs like SegWit to reduce transaction sizes (more bandwidth now, no paying for it later) and the Lightning Network (less blockchain transactions) seems much smarter to me.

The draw of Bitcoin is that the private key is the only point of failure. By the same token, you should never ever be giving anyone your private key. With PayPal, it is much easier for some to seal you money because there are multiple attack vectors (ex. Hack the site, hack the users email, etc). Bitcoins should always be in a wallet on a local computer and the private keys should never be given out. Let me reiterate, the private key should never be given out. This makes the currency disappearing issue much less likely.

You have the basics but are missing some detail.
You you have to open a channel to pay but you don't have to have that channel open directly to the person you are paying. As long as you have a channel to someone, who has a channel to someone, who has a channel to the person you are paying, you can pay them through the others. The process is automatic and only requires your consent. There is a "node fee" for each hop but it prevents having to open as many channels.
Also channels are not as rigid as you seem to think. They are established with an amount of count and a time till they close. Both the balance and the time till close can be reloaded/extended without closing the channel. I'm not sure if you can withdraw from an open channel though.

@_date: 2017-12-02 03:09:23
Bcash went to solve the transactions end / block chain scaling issue by increasing the block size. Bitcoin Core is trying to fix this issue using SegWit and the Lightning Network. Increasing the block size is only a temporary fix. Yes, more transactions can pass now but Bitcoin's main thing is decentralization. With larger blocks, the blockchain becomes larger on disk much faster leaving less people hosting it and centralizing the network. Core went the harder route with SegWit and Lightning. SegWit reduces the size a transaction takes so more transaction can fit in a block. The lightning network allows for users to open off chain channels to send could then when the channel is closed a summary of all the transactions is posted as one transaction to the Bitcoin chain.
The choice is yours. I encourage you to do your own research. favors Core heavily, favors Bcash, has a mix of both.

I agree. Inventing something that consumes electric and becomes popular does not equal an environmental crime. Especially because we need to remember that using electric isn't bad for the environment or pollutey. The problem/pollution comes from generation of said power. We have the tech to be generating all our electric with low to no emissions. 
In many cases, miners go out of their way to use cheaper, zero emission renewable energy. This is so much the case that in China, as they tried to combat Bitcoin, the government is preventing hydro-electric plants from selling to miners.

You got that response because your comment is silly. Sure one transaction cost more than buying 145GB of hard drive space but that's not the full story. You have to have a computer to handle all operations, internet bandwidth, electric, and some people also have to spend data. The hard drive space isn't the only factor.
Beyond that I can imagine anyone is in favor of high transaction fees but if I could implement a block size increase or a transaction size/number reduction tech tomorrow, Id go with the transaction size/number reduction tech. Here is why: increasing the block size isn't a permanent solution to anything. It is a temporary solution at a cost of blockchain size.
I think increasing block size will increase centralization. Either strategy will help increase adoption but one decreases the growth of the blockchain vs the other increasing size growth. From there is is simple. The more resources it costs to run a node, the fewer people will do it.

Crypto Currency is based on, well, cryptography. Cryptography is taking data and modifying it with special keys that a receiver publishes about themselves. When that data is modified with this public information (public key) the math behind it works out so that the only person that descramble it is the person with the private key. These keys are long, 2048 bits+ depending on the application. Trying to guess these keys isn't worth anyone's time.
The other half of it is the term "hacking" is a very broad term. In the context you are using it, it means someone trying to steal coins. This happens because someone finds a vulnerability and exploits it rather than reports it. It has happened before. There was a bug that allowed someone to create for themselves more coins that the 21 million coin max. The dev team fixed the bug and the network agreed to rollback to before it happen. 
As I said, hacking is very broad. One could argue Bitcoin is hacked all the time because others take the source code and modify it or hack it. This is encouraged. Hacking can also come in the form of programs that do something else like monitor your clipboard for Bitcoin addresses and them changing them to a hacker's address or injecting a miner in a website with out user permission.

I mean I would side with no. Solar is very expensive upfront. Unless you line in a $0.20/kW area, it's going to require you mine for upwards of 10 yrs to break even on the panels. Mining, on the other hand, is still kinda profitable. I don't recommend people get into mining right now. It does make money but the up front cost leaves an ROI time potentially longer than the profitable life of the rig. If you already have the hardware, mining is still fine.
If you are still interested in mining, go with GPUs over ASICs. They are more versitile and have a life past the next gen release where ASICs don't really. You can use a site like  to calculate current profitablity and ROI time then make a decision off that.

Mining is the process of verifying transactions on the network. When a miner (typically a group of miners working together) "mines" a "block" of transactions, they are rewarded with all the fees that the senders of those transactions attached plus, while while there is less than the maximum number of Bitcoins, a coin rewards (currently at 12.5 bitcoins). If you would like to get into mining you need to purchase some hella expensive equipment or mine altcoins. The easier was to get into mining profitably is using a program called NiceHash Miner. It does everything for you and has a pretty GUI. It automatically finds the most profitable altcoin to mine for you. Using NHM you aren't actually mining but renting your hardware to other miners. Because of this you are paid all in Bitcoin regardless of what coins you mine.

What are you planning on using to mine? I hope you aren't going to mine BTC directly.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:48:58
The way fees and the network work is that you send your transaction with whatever fee you WANT to pay. The transaction is submitted. Miners will essentially grab whoever is offering the highest transaction fee and process those first. Eventually when the high transaction fees are processed (low demand on the network) the miners will get down to the lower fee transactions and eventually yours.

Bitcoins can be traced if you are using them like an average user and not doing anything special to hide yourself. Yes, all transactions are stored in the block chain so you can follow a payment trail to an address extremely easily. The hard part is attaching that wallet to a person. Someone trying to mask themselves while using Bitcoin can by not associating there name with any account their BTC touches. For example, rather that buy BTC through an exchange they would opt for local trades or mining what currency they need. Obviously they will always use software or hardware wallet rather than exchange sites or online wallets. Lastly, crypto mixers (as someone else already mentioned) exist with the sole purpose of taking in a bunch of coin and passing it on without record of the break down of the amounts.
@_date: 2019-02-27 21:08:24
Consult with a professional but I believe that you assume the value to be what it would have cost to buy them the day you won them. You have to pay a prize tax on that initial amount then also assume that amount to be what you 'bought' them for. It's similar to winning a car. You have to pay a tax on the value of the car then it's just a normal car after that.

Can you be anymore specific? Mining is usually done with a client and is always free. Consumers also don't usually mine Bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:02:56
Kinda yes. Every transaction with BTC is posted publicly to the blockchain with the from, to, amount and other info. So if you put out an address and say this is my address then yes they can watch all the coins moving in and out of it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:03:28
No. I see it going one of two ways. Either the people financing loans/mortgage/etc will just be wealthly people with the coin to loan or two we will see financers join the car dealers/real estate agent/etc and sell the items on credit without the money ever existing. They'd finance the loan with the item rather than someone else's money.

What Bitcoin is mean to be really ends up coming down to the person you are talking to. Most importantly it comes down to the Core devs as they are calling the shots ATM. I personally think it can be both. The technologies in pipe to help the network I think will be able to accomplish both. SegWit is starting to be implemented which is going to help the size of the block chain and the Lightning Network is in development that will both keep transactions off the block chain but also way increase transactions speeds using the Litecoin Network. I personally don't see a huge problem with transaction speeds except for the BCH attack week. If I send a transaction with a reasonable fee, I can see it come out the other side in an hour usually; the last time I moved USD to Coinbase it took 7 days. I get that on the LTC chain transactions are nearly instant but an hour really isn't that bad.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:25:39
It doesn't matter what your Internet speed is but there are no profitable GPUs for Bitcoin mining anymore. You have to but ASICs (devices that can only mine). Much more expensive. I don't know what their RoIs are.

Smart investing 101:
Never invest more than you can afford to lose.
If all my investments went to $0 tomorrow I can still pay my way through school without taking out any loans or anything.
If Bitcoin went to $0 tomorrow I would still have investments. Surprisingly, of the coins I invested in, Bitcoin is performing the worst.
Never tell people on the internet numbers.
I will not tell you how much I invested, or percentage of net worth. If Bitcoin hits $1,000,000 and I give you nunbers, I've just become a target.

Yes. The problem is that usually what you sell your Bitcoin for is hard to rebuy Bitcoin with on the original site. For example, when Bitcoin was $13k on Zimbabwe's exchange site, many people questioned buying on Coinbase and selling there. The problem was they'd be selling their Bitcoin for the terrible, inflationary Zimbabwe currency. As long as you can find a way to transfer what you sell for back to your original exchange then the answer is yes.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:49:16
Yes. Technology is still a rapidly expanding, growing, and changing frontier. ISPs trying to block anything has an easy solution (a VPN) so this isn't a concern. ISPs snooping, as we  experience now, can be prevented (again with a VPN). The worst thing I see is data caps combined with low competition. If you can't switch off of your ISP that is capping you then you'll have to resort to using less data (in our case shutting down nodes). Now many places still have multiple options for ISPs and with the big gigabit fiber push there are more ISPs popping up constantly. It is worth keeping an eye on but not really concerning.

Hi Jaden. Not a huge fan of your work but, hey, a celeb is a celeb, amiright?

What could happens is your ISP could limit the amount of data you have to use the internet. The more common that becomes, the less people will run nodes at home (harming the network)
Comprised privacy is also a concern. A recent repeal already makes is so ISPs can snoop your traffic. In an ideal world where Bitcoin takes over, ISPs would still be able to attach you to a wallet (dismantle your privacy)
Lastly, The Bitcoin network uses a specific port right now, 8333. ISPs could block it to make it harder for you to use Bitcoin. This isn't too hard of a fix as a dynamic port tech could probably be added to Bitcoin if this got big.

Right. When you send a transaction and set the fee you are willing to pay, for the most part, the transaction/block with the highest fee will be mined. If you set the fee at what you are willing to pay, it will take longer but eventually it will be sent (assuming you don't put toooo low; like 5 sat/byte low)

The answer to "Can it be hacked?" is always yes. First, you never know what bugs there may be in the code someone could exploit. From there a hacker can target exchanges to drain coins from there or online wallets like we have seen before. I don't understand exactly what you mean buy Bitcoin "crashing" but there are 51% percent attacks where if a bunch of nodes or miners went down/offline/away and a bad guy spun up enough nodes to now be 51% of all of them they could start making fake transactions. Similar if they got 51% of mining power (if they got that much mining power I think they'd rather just mine b/c it would be hella profitable)

This if it this way. There is $100 spead across 10 people in our pocket economy and a loaf of bread costs $1. Our federal reserve prints another $100 so that the total circulating supply is now $200.

I as a shop owner raise the price of my loaf of bread to $2 because it's still just as hard to make.

The only reason it is traceable is because most people tie their name to a wallet somewhere; typically exchanges. If you don't put your name on a wallet it is not traceable. This would require obtaining your coins anonymously ie. From localbitcoins.com or a Bitcoin ATM or something like that.

2x is a different type of crypto-currency or "coin". In Nov 2017 2x will be taking a snapshot of the amount of Bitcoin everyone has and giving everyone an equal amount of their coin, 2x. You will not be doubling your money, just receiving another coin. There is a lot of fuss around this event so 2x will be worth something if you sell it but probably not the same amount as 1 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:47:19
I don't see anyone address the second part of you question about why this has to be in a fork. The way a crypto currency works is that everyone participating on the network must have the exact same blockchain and code. If a note or miner or other participant alters their code at all they are unable to communicate with the network, excluding themselves or creating a fork. There are different kinds of forks but that's a different story. To make a change to Bitcoin, the devs, or someone else, has to change the code then get everyone else to adopt it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:03:28
The price comes down more to whether people are going to want the new coin or not. Nodes are important to keep things going but don't affect price.

While I kinda agree with you, Coinbase got in legal trouble for not supporting the last BTC fork. There was a class action filed against them by coin holders that wanted the shitcoin that Coinbase wasn't supporting. I believe this to be a result of that. Coinbase is very much the fluffy, easy way to get into BTC and that's how they like it because they can charge a higher fee. If they have multiple 'bitcoins' then people will be more confused and it will hurt Coinbase too. That's my 2 cents anyways.

Here's the thing, there are extra fees but the store pays them for you. For example, every card swipe is a fee for someone. Companies like Venmo or my landlord will charge that fee to me if I want to use a card instead of a check or bank transfer.
Also, there is definitely a wait. Again, not for you but for the company. That wait is anywhere from 24-36 hours for a card transaction to go through. At the register the card company just says that, yes, the card holder has funds. This can be done with Bitcoin as well. Yes the sending wallet has funds or the transaction has been broadcast to the network so you are good to go. 
"But MeCJay12, you can double spend the coins to kill the transaction!" Yeah, and you can charge back a credit card transaction. That's what Shrink/Loss is on the balance sheet.

I agree that the current lack of fraud protection is not great but that can change. Imagine an insurance to cover this; a wallet insurance. If you lose your funds then this company pays you back while they go through investigating and recovering the funds. I don't know what the future will hold but I can see this problem being fixed.
Sure there currently aren't many instances of banks or companies stopping charges (other than banks to crypto exchanges) but I personally live in the USA. Go to China and let's see if that changes. Plus that isn't the old positive. There is also no borders with crypto. I can send money to Europe without paying to exchange currencies or any other nonsense.

Trust can't be coded; it comes with time. Transactions in seconds I still don't think is a requirement. Like I said, a cashier could tell your your bill in BTC and you just scan a QR code that does everything but send the transaction (you just verify and click send) then the register system notices the incoming transaction are you are done. "Instant" transaction. Faster than a credit card. On top of that Lightning Network just came out that is actually transactions in seconds.
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:15:18

It is faster than the current CC system. The current CC system takes anywhere from 24-36 hours to actually receive a customer's money. There is just a pre-check that the store uses to minimize the risk of the payment falling through. That can be done right now manual by checking to make sure the sending wallet has the fund and/or that the transaction has been broadcast. All it would take to automate that process (to make it feel as smooth as a CC transaction) would be some code on the register to make a scanable QR code transaction then the register just waits to see the transaction broadcast.

For the best app to use, again, for someone just starting, go with Nicehash. It's the easiest app to use but not necessarily the best. Apps like MiningPoolHub will give you better profits and more coin variety but it's complex to setup. You could also choose to mine any number of coins directly.
