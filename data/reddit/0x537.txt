If you want to split your seed into parts you should look into [Shamir's secret sharing]( which is better than choosing an arbitrary position to split your seed into parts. 
Bruteforcing 8 out of 24 words is still very VERY hard. Someone can probably do the exact math. **Edit:** someone correct me if I'm wrong but it would still require 2048^8 tries to get the right combination. 
The 25th word option / password is still the best option IMHO. You can always memorize your seed and if it gets stolen, recover it before the 25th word is cracked.

Contact Coinbase, tell them you sent to an invalid address and you would need them to resend using a higher fee to the correct Binance address.  
If this was your own wallet, you could it yourself, but since you left your Bitcoin in Coinbase, it's their wallet and you need to ask support about this.
Remember, not your private keys / wallet not your Bitcoin.

Hey! Thanks for the tip. To be honest, I didn't give it much thought since the problem/math behind this method is still as secure as SHA256 and too hard to attack by brute-forcing, no matter how fast your program/machine is.
With that said, your Chainwallet is a very cool idea. You would only need to memorize a very small password and two numbers (base/exp) to create a wallet that is safe and gets you time to safe your funds in case of security breaches (like getting your private key stolen).
