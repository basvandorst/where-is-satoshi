Yes. 
It'd be far more credible than the current system.

'Come on..' -FTFY
Apparently you didn't hear the femminazi and Uber White Knights spewing that shrill hyperbole ('You're worse than rapists!!') at Redditors who were simply looking at the JLaw leaked photos.

Soooo what have we learned today.. PayPal is an even bigger bunch of douches than we'd previously assumed?
Got it; not surprised.

You used this photo without her permission.. I recently heard that makes you worse than a rapist.

You're delusional on both counts, or simply affiliated with PayPal in some way. bye.

What about the fact that none of Paypal's competitors do this?
Also, PayPal does release the funds when pushed, and does not hold your funds after that point, which appears to disprove this theory.
Further, credit card providers can be considered financial intermediaries, and they too do not exhibit this behavior.

They are notorious for doing this for a very long time. Many presume they do this on a massive scale to collect the interest on many millions of dollars in funds, thereby generating millions for them in free profit off of your money.
Often they'll release the funds, but only after you've harassed them through their support maze (I speak from experience); Basically, they just have a philosophy of 'let's see what we can get away with until the customer complains'
Since they are not a bank, they are not regulated and can get away with this kind of crap. I too cannot wait for the day when they, and predatory companies like them are driven out of business by fair-playing competitors.
