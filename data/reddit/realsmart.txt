why is it not an option to use openssl with some golang bindings?
*update:* okay, I can see the answer below (avoiding external dependencies)

It is a good thing nobody knows who they are and where are the servers. Thus no corrupt state employee or criminal can apply force/power to it.
And the owners are interested in keeping the thing running because it generates steady predictable income (i.e. it would be foolish to just grab everything and run if you imply this).

That only works if there is no mtgox lag which can be truly horrific at times.

And here is the [btce-trollbox console client](
It's read-only and thus does not require one to sign up or anything. And you can run it in a dedicated terminal window of **any size** you like.

yeah, readonly.  my buddy wrote it yesterday because he was sick of the small little trollbox where the comments fly by too fast.  besides the trollbox in your favorite terminal is cool :)
though, note, it can be made read-write no problem. it works through websocket and their protocol seems manageable (json-json-json).

Maybe merchants hesitate because of the overall complexity (things you have to be an expert in like addresses, transactions, wallets, security, exchanges, etc.). So if you look from this point of view this cute device actually lowers the learning curve considerably.
