I use coinbase, it has next day payout when you transfer to your bank, and the fee isn't very high.

I removed them because it scanned fine w/o and I liked the way it looked  but if somebody wants it I have no problem keeping it for them.

I just bought 0.1 bitcoins from them because I don't have any right now, and I will be getting them on monday.
If you try to sell them now I believe you will get the payment within 24 hours. 
I sold around 0.2 yesterday and the money was in my bank this morning.
