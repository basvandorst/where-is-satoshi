I’m kinda divided on Yang. On one hand he’s complaining about automation…which is a good thing for businesses and supports our way of life. on the other hand he’s endorsing blockchain tech. 
Doesn’t matter either way. He’s 4th or 5th in polls.

That is cringey. I know Yang doesn’t have a chance now but one could dream

Tech is the way of the future. Not unlike cellphones, computers, the internet or even the railroad. As we learned from the past either you surf that wave or you get wiped out.

In the article, it stated otherwise. If what you’re saying is true then he’s earned my vote.

Is this an American bank?

Well not necessarily sell it. What if you need to use it but a place you’re trying to purchase isn’t accepting it?
