You just answered your own question.  THIS is the equilibrium that defines the "value" of any arbitrary unit of record, whether it's fiat or crypto.
Bitcoin moves in bigger swings than dollars, but understand that your $1 held does not have the same global purchasing power from minute to minute.  Pragmatically, you don't really care that your dollar can buy more or less things in a region 5,000 miles away from you, but it's happening.  
Bitcoin being stateless (not controlled by a nation) means its very nature will never be as stable.  But it **doesn't matter**.  All that matters is faith in the store of value.  That can be lost very quickly in fiat (i.e. Argentina, Zimbabwe, etc.) and very quickly in crypto.  But long-term what do you have more faith in?  Or do you have balanced faith in both?  
We all make decisions moment to moment what we want to spend and what we want to save for later.  On a nine-year horizon, Bitcoin has shown that a truly decentralized system with a deflationary supply traded in the world's freest market holds it value by 1000s of times more than any fiat.  
No one knows what happens tomorrow for fiat or crypto. Seeking certainty in anything is futile. You can only make decisions day to day on how you want to spend and how you want to store value for later.

The thing is, a government can spin up its own coin and make it legal tender, but that's not going to make it any more stable or valuable a currency than the US dollar. Their coin is likely going to be centralized, closed source, or both. This means that even if they initially program it as deflationary like btc, there's no guarantee they won't change its properties later.
Government can use blockchain tech, but its very nature means it can't be decentralized and that's the power of a non-state backed currency that's ruled by consensus. This is where bitcoin slowly built its support over nine years as more people truly understand it. (Recent run-up not included, that's added a ton of simple-minded bullrun chasers.)

Best defense against that is the natural competitiveness between nations in technology. Nations who embrace innovators prosper, something the US has benefited from over the last century and only recent political events have shown reversing. 
Technologists don't tend to be nationalists; the more that countries like the US regress -- in social tolerance and irrationally propping up obsolete status quo solutions -- the more alternative regions become appealing to live and settle.

What if you sell coins for fiat on an anonymous exchange with a terrible reputation that never took your KYC details and there was no way for you to withdraw that fiat.  Later you buy them back as coins, withdraw, and pat yourself on the back for getting out of that scam exchange early enough?  
In all practicality, you never had an opportunity to use the fiat and would never in a million years have been able to legally recover its value through a court system that doesn't even have a standard definition of crypto.

Great summary! Since the vast majority of bitcoin *users* are people using SPV wallets, what is the likely outcome of 91% miners supporting 2X and Core dev not?  How does it affect usability of different wallets and do those software devs need to draw a line in sand on what they support?
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:21:13
$4k is an arbitrary number and entirely relative to its price 1d, 1m, 1y ago etc. 
It's same with stock prices.  Apple (APPL) is $159/share and Google (GOOG) is $922/share, but Apple has a **$200 billion** higher market value.  
The number's irrelevant.  All that matters is % growth.  Do you think Bitcoin can still grow?  It's a product that could be of use to all 7 billion people on the planet and right now the estimate is only approximately 4 million people own any amount of bitcoin (and a tiny percentage of those will have all their wealth in it). 
So, how much more demand will there be for Bitcoin in the future?

Well I was replying to the comment "And yet you can't do much with Bitcoin without converting it to fiat".
Yes, there's no telling if bitcoin the currency will outlast its successors. There's arguments for and against. I like to lean on nine years of hard competition and attacks haven't seemed to give the market a reason to declare another currency "digital gold".  Etherium built smart contracts quicker and now its earned some market share alongside but clearly not by cannibalizing btc.

I've wondered if the BCC $300 price is meaningful. I'd estimate 99% of bitcoin users fit in the category of not feeling comfortable redeeming their BCC.  BTC has myriad of long-standing, reputable SPV wallet solutions to allow the layman to make transactions easily.  BCC has... what?  
I consider myself technically savvy and I have no interest in running a full node, no trust in the sliver of wallet options, and am not going to be signing up for a new exchange to sell it.

Such a non-argument. You couldn't do much with the Internet before individuals and organizations built services on top of it.
What you can do RIGHT NOW is irrelevant to what a technology can do in the future. There's nothing left to prove. Triple-entry accounting and a decentralized, cryptographic-enforced ledger exist. You can't undiscover it or undevelop it. 
It allows individuals to control their own wealth and enact commerce directly between one another. This concept has tantalized economists for centuries but it's never been technically possible in a scalable, trustable way. Now it is. 
Honestly, any intelligent person can see the incredible potential of this technology. The main thing holding it up is people still simply don't believe that cryptographic enforcement is real. They still think cryptography can be "hacked."  Only human's inability to secure their passphrases is what compromises any bog standard modern encryption algo.

Something ironic about this situation with the official website for a book that's training developers on the world's most secure distributed ledger.

That could very well be 500,000 hodlers who have bought BTC and never sold it back to fiat.  As with any property, you only declare it to IRS when you sell, not when you buy.

When you create a transaction in Bitcoin, you're competing with every other transaction also being broadcast. There are limited transactions that can be confirmed each block (which occurs approx every 10 mins). Miners choose which transactions to confirm and the software they use will typically favor the transactions that have agreed to pay the highest fee.
As a casual bitcoin user with some wallet software or using an online wallet, the handling of the fee is often done for you, and is algorithmically set to some rate that will make sure the transaction happens quickly. 
A common insinuation in this subreddit is that many of the most popular exchanges (who also offer wallet services) are artificially setting the fee higher than it needs to be. This may or may not be true. The assertion is that they're doing this as a long-term effort to devalue BTC in favor of spin-off coins like Bitcoin Cash. This may or may not be true.

What wallet did you use to retrieve your BCH?

I would like to hear you two debate more. This is well-reasoned conversation by knowledgable developers who are observing peers and their practices.  You guys should be writing the Medium articles and not the myriad of pundits summing up the issues, but having zero qualification to do so.
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:40:09
That is wonderfully logical. If only the government gave a crap about that. 
If you sold stock in Apple and bought the exact same dollar value in Google, you are paying gains on the Apple stock based on your cost basis.  It doesn't matter you're not holding any more cash than when you started.  There is no "wash".
Bitcoin is classified exactly the same way.  Here's the actual IRS notice on this from years ago... refer to Q-6.
Exchanging bitcoin for any kind of physical good is considered a "sale or exchange" which is a taxable event.

"Scheduled split." "Investors received equal amount of BCH."
This explanation is so cringeworthy. I get that media really desperately needs to tie the language of bitcoin to traditional investment language, but it's such a disservice to the tech and dumbing down of the event. 
Someone needs to go on their show and in 10 minutes create a fork of the Bitcoin Core repo, change a few lines (maybe increase block size limit to 16MB!), name it CNBC 16X Coin and say "Congrats I've just issued you an additional 100% of your current bitcoin holdings in a 'split'!" 
The inevitable question will be, "If Bitcoin Cash just did that, how comes the market values it at 5-10% of BTC?"  Answer: "People be dumb."
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:26:46
100% not true, I'm afraid:

The housing crisis had regulation and oversight and no one was doing their jobs. SEC and ratings agencies were all there to protect us. Now there's some more regulation and more oversight... great! I'm sure things won't get out of hand again. History never repeats itself.
Describing bitcoin as an "unregulated speculative bubble" misses so many points. Bitcoin is software. A dude wrote a thesis then he wrote some code then he put it out into the wild. Then without any coordinated government, do-gooder or robber baron effort, people -- regular people with computers -- just started to use it. That's the difference. It was NOT created by the wealthiest 1% in finance who made up obtuse financial instruments, raked in billions, and then cried, "We had no idea!" when the shoe dropped.
And you: "Regulate it! Save us!" Regulate what? The right for individuals and entities to enact commerce directly without middlemen, oversight and fees? That's all crypto software enables. Regulate the right to have knowledge of a string of letters and numbers? The algorithm regulates bitcoin, I'm good with that.
I've been working and earning a good living a long time, live frugally and invest my savings in both bitcoin and traditional instruments... over a 10-year horizon, bitcoin is so far in the lead, I wish I hadn't been so conservative on it.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:59:17
Not only that but every time you spend bitcoin, you succumb to a taxable event, so even for us long-term holders every purchase comes with:
- 15% capital gains tax
- 1.5% Coinbase fee for repurchasing whatever was spent
Naysayers always argue that "government will shut down bitcoin". I don't think any modern democracy can pass a law that says an individual is not permitted to have knowledge of a string of letters and numbers.  But defining bitcoin as property and subject to taxable gains whenever exchanged for fiat, goods or services certainly makes horrible as a currency.
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:52:57
Fascinating! In this instance there is a single sequence declared an [illegal number]( It remains to be seen if you could extend that concept to be applied universally to any valid bitcoin address, but I suppose this does dismantle the argument that no democracy can ban simply having knowledge of something. How disappointing!

When you do any kind of commerce that doesn't involve paper cash exchanging hands, you are relying on a bank. This is fact. You might wave your magic plastic card and things happen and you're happy, but it's because there are several middlemen in the process verifying you are authorized to spend what you're spending and charging the merchant for the privilege (which gets passed onto you by raising prices).  
You say, "Sure. Bank's done fine by me and I don't care I'm paying higher, so what?" Well, in 2008, the bank didn't do fine by you or anyone else. People with actual savings care about this more, as they saw 40% of their wealth evaporate overnight. Not talking about wealthy people, talking about 65-yr old lifelong workers with $100-500k in savings for ~30 years of retirement to pay for.
Forgetting corruption and incompetence that caused the crash, the US dollar (and all country's currencies) is carefully manipulated by a few officials (the Federal Reserve for the US) who think they know better how to control monetary value than the complex orchestra of an organic free market. Whether they're right or wrong is irrelevant, they decide.  What we know is that $1 in 1950 now requires $9 to purchase the same thing today. That's the result of an inflationary debt-based economy that the Fed runs.
Many economists believe that a deflationary monetary supply is a better system.  Bitcoin subscribes to this system and more importantly is completely immutable and independent of any person or organization wanting to influence it.  It is a value transfer system, using an independently managed monetary supply that knows no borders. 
So to paraphrase your question, "What percentage of everyday people care about this?" Very few, even though it affects them all.
