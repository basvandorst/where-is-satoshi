Absolute nail on the head. The Doge community is about having fun, it's not taking the piss out of Bitcoin but rather an alternative way to "Like" a post or comment by tipping.
And, as this weekend showed, it's also a way to provide undershibes with a nice boost to their career if they show promising talent.

How does it generate these addresses, and how can you know if it's truly unique and not already taken?
Is there a chance that the same address could have already been taken or is there some algorithm where it takes some bytes from /dev/random and mixes it with the current unix timestamp or something?
If there was such a collision, would that mean that you've just gained somebody else's bitcoins by mistake?

This wave of intense media coverage is a good thing. This video shows that it's being taken seriously too. How long until we see a BTC ticker on CNBC and other channels?

The police don't give your hard disks back if they're seized which kinda sucks.
You may find this article interesting (it's a good read): 
It's best to encrypt your wallet (could also put it in a Truecrypt container if you like) and store it in "the cloud" somewhere i.e. Skydrive, Gmail etc.

I work for one of the biggest hosting companies in the world. Our available bandwidth could cope with any DDOS with ease.
We have multiple Tier 1 peering arrangements and then some.
I reached out to Mt Gox and had a short email exchange with someone called Mark who works there.
In short, they are not interested in scaling their infrastructure. If they were, I could help them become a multi-million dollar business but it seems like they just don't care.
I *could* help them fix this, but any cooperation is a two-way thing.
If you guys are reading this, get in touch and we'll work on this together.

I agree on the cheque thing. It's obvious why they were phased out because there is no way to know if the person paying by cheque even has the money in the account because it wasn't an electronic transaction.
Obviously the debt is passed to the bank (and therefore the account holder) if the transaction used a cheque guarantee card, but it's still a really bad system.
However, I would give BTC a little more time before dismissing it. It needs time to stabilise before becoming viable as a currency for buying stuff.
The investors/traders have jumped on it for the purpose of making quick money (and who can blame them?) but all currencies have people like this - it just needs to become bigger than can be affected by the influence of the day traders. Remember that crashes happen too for fiat currency.

Not at all, I'm just pointing out that an exchange such as NYSE has vastly more experience than BTC exchanges which have existed for a very small timescale in comparison.

A packet of 20 cigarettes here will set you back around £8, or $12.79.
When I was in Philly last year I think I was paying about 6 bucks for a pack - so half the price.
Britain is ridiculously expensive. We do have the NHS though so it's not all bad.

If they did get busted for currency exchange (highly unlikely) then that would mean that BTC is a genuine currency in the eyes of the government.

One thing I don't understand though: how would they then convert the BTC to USD? 
Company accounts aren't done in BTC (yet) so they'd have to sell them off somehow.
Would they do it by using an exchange or sell them another way?

NYSE is not "just as vulnerable". Critical systems are airgapped. Same as in the NSA and every other three-letter agency.

It's weird because the US is kinda old fashioned when it comes to cards, and much like the UK was 10 years ago.
 - You just sign the paper slip most of the time and they compare it to the signature on the back of your card. Chip &amp; PIN is still rare in a lot of places. In some places they don't even take cards, only cash, which is a bit of a bitch you combine it with:
 - ATM fees, like you mentioned. 10 years ago in the UK you would be charged for using a cash machine if it wasn't the same bank that you have an account with but these charges have mostly disappeared now. You can still find the occasional cash machine in a pub or shop that does charge £1-2.50 though.
The UK banking system is one of the most technically advanced in the world, but it's certainly not without it's problems as you might know e.g. bailouts.
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:42:24
Who do the fees go to? Do they just disappear?

I'm glad you recovered the data, but this post illustrates everything that is wrong with this current crazy situation.
*Nobody* should be keeping so much capital tied up in BTC that they'd be made homeless if they lost them or the price crashed. Please take my advice and cash out half of them right the fuck now. Jesus.
