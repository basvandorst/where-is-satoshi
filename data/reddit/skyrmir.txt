Anyone studying the algorithm should do it at least once.  Not to actually mine anything, just to fully grok the algorithm.

The pound was on a silver, and later gold, standard until 1925.  Also, it's over a millennia old.  And that comparison assumes silver is worth the same amount for centuries.  At that time scale it might not even weigh the same.

It really seems like there should be a way to narrow the nonce down to a smaller field.  The question is if there is a short cut, would it even be faster then brute forcing anyway?  Just because you can calculate probable options, doesn't mean you can do it faster than trying them in the first place.

It's already allowed by FCC regulation.  They'd use it for child porn blocking, but it's not as identifiable.

Even here it's called savings, except that so many people are doing it, they're driving down the price of treasury bonds, which is the chart in the thumbnail.  A chart that explains why your savings account has almost zero returns, and happens to look a LOT worse when you run it out for decades.

Lol, the US can shut down most of the globes internet.  That's why Germany is shitting itself over the NSA.  They can't get rid of us if they wanted to.  That may change in the future, but by then Bitcoin would be relegated to Dubai and the Arab states that didn't ban it. Bitcoin isn't like piracy, it depends on mining networks communicating constantly in order to be viable.  That's it's Achilles heel, because you can stop all transactions with a simple packet filter.

Bitcoin really isn't useful to WU right now.  It doesn't actually have any features or uses that would be profitable to them outside of exchange services that don't show enough profit for them to invest in it.  Most likely if WU does anything with Bitcoin, it would be by partnering with some exchange to keep the regulatory reporting out of their hands.  And it's going to be a while before that even seems worthwhile to them.

I don't buy from overstock with cash, why the hell would go through the trouble of getting bitcoins for them?

Have ISP's with public connections be required to block all packets containing or directed to bitcoin exchanges.  Bitcoin dies within a week.
Make no mistake, the government can and will shut down bitcoin, if the need arises.  Right now, it's a tiny market that requires access through exchanges that can be shut down at will.  Regulated exchange through banks would give bitcoin a much more stable future.  As it is, the best protection that cryptocurrencies have right now are hedge funds that want to keep congress or the IRS from getting serious about enforcing banking regulations and chasing tax evaders.

I transferred them to litecoin long enough ago that my wallet ap is broken now and I haven't bother to fix it, since I haven't found a use for a crypto coin.
@_date: 2014-09-18 02:14:02
Because I'm an opinionated ass.  Any more stupid questions?
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:21:34
Not really, I started out by mining Litecoin, did a few others and eventually just dumped them all into my litecoin wallet.  After a while I just unloaded the wallet since I couldn't find a use for them.  Which is what I mean about overstock.  I wouldn't spend actual money for anything they sell, why would I go through more trouble to use an alternate currency?

What they're naive about is that the power to control your life doesn't go away, and someone will take it.  Limiting government just gives that power to someone less accountable.

Depends on the problem, and assuming 50 different solutions is the best answer, is only the first part of the problem for libertarians.  The prisoner dilemma also demonstrates that the best individual answer, is not always the best answer for the group.  In the case of states, that means the best answer for the group will never be reached.
Rampant individualism is only good fore the few.  Ayn Rand didn't find a better way, she found a path to oligarchy.

That's not the argument at all, the entire point of democracy is that it decentralizes power to the sum of the populace.
@_date: 2018-11-16 17:42:40
I understand very well the various versions of libertarian.  What they campaign on, and ask for, will not end in the result they are seeking.  The only policies libertarians end up implementing, only further more crony capitalism.  Which is by design, and what will end up happening every time their cause is put forward.  Because at it's base, the libertarian ideal is flawed by it's blindness for the use of government, just as much as the communists are blind to the use of markets.

Bringing authority to smaller regions, makes those regions more susceptible to corruption and capture.  There will be less accountability, which is the goal of the movement.  Moving as much authority as possible into captured institutions.

We still have slavery, it's just called prison labor now.  And there's a very serious argument for wage slavery at current pay scales.
The fix for slaves voting against it is simply to revoke their rights to vote for committing a felony, then decide what's going to be a felony, and who we're going to catch doing it.
The states with lower labor standards, have lower wages, higher poverty, and run negative on taxes paid to benefits received.  They're dragging the country down and making us all worse off for it.  And it's a reinforcing effect.  The lower labor standards draw investment for low wage workers, which cost more than they pay in taxes, meanwhile the profits get pulled out of the state to be kept in outside financial interests.
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:23:13
It's the exact opposite of your point.  The best plan for each state, is not always the best plan for the country.  
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:45:54
Slavery was great for each individual state.  Labor standards are against the interest of any individual state.  Any transfer of resources that would make all participants better off at the expense of an outlier above standards, would be against the interests of the individual.
And yes, what's better for the group than an individual is up to interpretation.  That's why we have a representative government.  Nothing is clear cut, there is no easy ideological answer, and the answer is very likely to change with time or circumstance.

Ron Paul is no longer libertarian enough?
And if you'd payed any attention to the lip service republicans give to small government and free markets, you'd see that it's always in the cause of hurting labor or enriching themselves.  
This is why the terms big or small government are ridiculous in any current discussion.  They're meaningless due to propaganda, no different than Trump defining all news he doesn't like as 'fake news'.
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:25:00
Paul is invested in oil, gold, and cement, and thus moved to remove any regulation he could from his investments, while pushing to not have to pay taxes on the millions in gold he's holding.

Enforcing property laws and contractual laws requires the ability to to remain impartial and the authority to take property.  There is no form of private entity that will ever have those qualities.  Profit motive destroys impartiality, force strong enough to take property, will do exactly that for it's own profit.

The difference is between nothing and something, is always something.  Bitcoin with no value is abandoned and replaced.  Gold with very little value is still used and useful.  And as long as it's used and useful, it may very well increase in value again.  If Bitcoin drops to zero, it will never be used again.  Another cryptocurrency might be created at some future date, but Bitcoin itself would be gone.  And more to the point, Bitcoin can be artificially dropped to 0 by political decision.  No one and no one government can just tell the world that gold is worthless.
@_date: 2015-04-17 17:24:18
Bitcoin takes over 5 minutes for a transaction, requires dealing with an unregulated exchange, setting up multiple devices, accounts, software, is easily misdirected by a typo, and cannot be physically handed out in part without electricity.  And that's before dealing with the possibility that the packets can be identified and blocked if transmitted outside of a VPN, and bitcoin usage depends on an open network, preventing a VPN.
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:36:09
If you take away the internet, bitcoin has zero value.  Even without electricity, gold has value.
Note: Taking away the internet just means stopping bitcoin traffic.

This law doesn't apply to Bitcoin, it applies to currency.  The US already decided Bitcoin is a commodity, not a currency.  Where it's going to be applied is at any exchange in the US.  You'll be able to move your bitcoin wherever you want, right up until you want to turn it into cash.
This is why they decided it's a commodity.  There is no legal or technical framework for actually regulating Bitcoin.  As long as it's a commodity, they don't even have to try.

Amazingly enough, companies that sell things of significant value keep a record of it, and report it. Especially if they have to ship it over a border.
The IRS doesn't care if they seize bitcoins or a car or every bank account you own.  They will take everything they can get their hands on, then make sure that anyone who wants to stay out of jail, gives them a cut of any money meant to be paid to you.
@_date: 2013-10-12 11:58:22
Tax agencies can happily take you shit and sell it until your bill is paid.  They'll know how much you're stashing in Bitcoin, because exchange operators are regulated as banks and will be shut down and arrested if they don't.

My point is that they don't need to, they can seize all of your other cash flow or worldly possessions, with only a few limitations.  Being able to lock some portion away, isn't going to help you if you can never use it.
@_date: 2013-10-12 19:47:38
That's the thing though, either you'll give them the cash, or they'll keep taking your shit.  And they'll make sure they no one can pay you without paying them.

Seize assets that they obviously don't have the income to have acquired legally.  It usually happens in waves after a new election.  New officials wanting to look hard on crime, so they go into the projects and bust the guy living in HUD housing while driving a car with $100k worth of modifications.

You don't seem to realize that our IRS is a pale version of what it used to be.  They've been severely curtailed, since the 60's and 70's after several high profile cases and deaths.
