my bad. i was just regurgitating my thoughts before i saw a squirrel. smh shitty short term memory...
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:32:41
NO. that’s why it hasn’t replaced coinbase. FFS. When will the bisq ppl get this?
@_date: 2018-09-30 16:50:26
I second this!
@_date: 2018-10-24 21:56:18
generally any utxo based coin can be added with a little tweaking
edit: and for eth [ although its been in forever testing phase
@_date: 2018-10-02 12:53:15
whaat? I used lnd for this very reason. it has autopilot implemented.
@_date: 2018-10-02 03:26:29
has neutrino?
@_date: 2018-10-02 03:22:35
wow nice! thnx much.
@_date: 2018-10-02 12:07:24
I know they’re not made by the same developers. It was just as side tracked thought I had at the end in regards to setting it all up
@_date: 2018-10-24 17:07:53
Bisq is lacking; imho to increase usability a bit:
1.) Atomic swaps for crypto-to-crypto exchanges. This would eliminate the need to have extra bitcoin held in escrow as the transaction either happens all in one go, or it doesn't. I can understand having to hold extra btc in escrow for crypto &lt;=&gt; fiat transfers, but that shouldn't be the case for crypto &lt;=&gt; crypto.
2.) If they figure out how to do 1 between btc&lt;=&gt;eth, talk to the guys over at Paradigm, as they're building something similar (with some other features like loans &amp; shorting). They might be able to contribute to each other's dex's and get the ball rolling on cross chain lending services and derivatives on a decentralized platform.
3.) not at the moment, and already mentioned in the post, but lightning network integration as it becomes easier to use for the end user over time. autopilot channel creation and efficient payment routing is seriously lacking atm, but once these are fixed, having bisq nodes on the lightning network contributing to channel routing would be a win/win for everyone.

not sure. I'm using zap-desktop as my client with autopilot turned on in my lnd.conf. but i checked the lncli commands and it looks good to go.
@_date: 2018-10-02 12:59:27
once earn.com sends my my pennies/satoshis i'll totally will lol. meh they take 24 hours to send such a small amount...they should seriously think about integrating lightning...
@_date: 2018-10-02 17:17:50
built in light client / server functionality. So basically, you would be able to run a bitcoin core as a light client, or if you have a full node, you could serve the blockchain's information to remote light clients such as lnd and other bitcoin core nodes, in a secure and trustless manner.
@_date: 2018-10-02 12:13:12
And LTC. Lnd can do either one. Lighting is coin agnostic. Just as long as the coin has a fix for malleability attacks. In bitcoin and litecoin’s case that’s segwit. But hell, even bcash, can operates on the lightning network once they incorporate a malleability fix (lol)
But no, it’s not it’s own coin. It’s a second layer network that works on top of an existing coin.
@_date: 2018-06-21 20:46:20
only problem with bisq is that you already need to have bitcoin in order to use it - you need to lock up some btc for insurance in order to buy/sell. if you're trying to buy bitcoin and dont currently have any, using bisq isn't even an option....
edit - that and it's missing lightning network support. bisq with ln support would be friggin awesome!

So as an owner of a cat... I’ll be a little more accurate here bc it’s not pointless to keep belling the cat (I.e. altcoins).
The cat is having a really hard time to take off the collar with the bell off.  It’s rolling on the ground struggling to get it off. Put a collar with a bell on an adult cat and just sit there and get some popcorn if u wanna see this in real life.
Yes, the another mouse that puts a second bell on the cat still runs the risk that it might get eaten, but the cat is already frustrated concentrating on the first bell on its neck. So if the second mouse dings it’s tail, it might get away. Then another one dings a paw. Then the other paw. All 4. The poor cat is gonna go nuts trying to get all these bells off... it’ll be hilarious to see. And u’ll be able to hear it all over the house ��.
Keep the alts coming. All of them. And then some.

THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST DR STRANGE COSTUME I HAVE EVER SEEN. IN ALL MY YEARS OF EXISTENCE. IN ALL OF TIME. EVER.
@_date: 2019-02-19 04:14:31
It can be used on Ethereum’s network as wbtc (wrapped bitcoin) so we now have the first phases of interoperability between protocols taking shape. It’s only a matter of time...
@_date: 2019-02-09 17:57:00
if ur using the lightning network this is moot
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:53:25
just noticed this!!! lol!

Not free, but reduced sentence. Drug lords from actual gangs, the kind that actually DO kill people and conduct human trafficking, receive more lenient sentences than this guy. The judge who sentenced him, Judge Katherine B. Forrest, even said during his sentencing that she was giving him that sentence to "make a statement" - TWO (yes, you read that right, not one, but TWO) life sentences without the possibility for parole PLUS 40 years. Murderers and child molesters get more lenient sentences.  And the FBI agent who got him on the murder for hire charges was later caught with stealing bitcoin from the investigation and tampering with evidence, and was serving time for it. No murder actually went down. 10-20 years I can agree with for Ulbricht. Life is a bit much. TWO life sentences, plus another 40 years in case he lives long enough past those? Why don't cold blooded murderers and child molesters get that kind of sentencing? It sends the message "murder and pedophilia is ok, it is a lesser crime than f\*\*\*ing with the almighty, all powerful, majestic god that is the U.S. Government, all hail our mighty overlords!"
If Judge Forrest had the ok to sentence him to death by firing squad in a public square in front of city hall in the middle of Manhattan, she would've probably even done that to "make a statement"

Once neutrino is on mainnet it'll get waaay more affordable and a lot easier.
@_date: 2018-11-05 21:28:36
why not both?
@_date: 2019-01-30 03:59:22
how u running neutrino on mainnet? neutrino hasnt been released on mainnet yet... been wanting to run my lnd node on neutrino for some time now....
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:28:39
um how is this different from p2pool?
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:30:44
this is priceless. i just spewed soda all over my screen.

\^\^ this
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:33:00
You read that wrong. He should get same as said drug lords. The drug lords I refer to don't get double life plus 40. You can look up as many cases as you like for folks caught selling drugs, doubt you'll find any as long as this guy's sentence here in the US. If you do, post a link and prove me wrong.

If i could give more than upvote on this one i'd spam the upvote button like 10000 times.
edit: they should also update the platform to do atomic swaps between coins that are capable of doing so (i.e. litecoin, decred, and ethereum once it's been battle tested)
