i think we are looking on the price from 2 different angles. i am looking from the usability point of view and you are looking from the quantitative point of view.
not sure if you are prepared, but $ 1 trillion is just the starting point. when international trade is significantly done using bitcoin, then central banks are forced to aquire bitcoins as a reserve. i have no idea what the price will be at that point.

@_date: 2017-12-12 23:51:09
it seems to be also related to the monetary policy and the overall stability of your society. japan for example has currently 250% of GDP as debt and no inflation at all. it looks like there are other, or additional, reasons necessary to have hyperinflation. the amount of debt is not sufficient.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:56:42
if he was just bullish he would estimate an increase by 10 fold the current price which would make a 10% exposure necessary.
if he is even more bullish then he estimates an increase by 20 fold the current price which would make a 5% exposure sufficient.

some reason. wallstreet is not an entity. there are bitcoin bears and bitcoin bulls. wallstreet is connected to very rich people. my expectation is that some very rich people are also very pissed right now, because they have not been able to expose themself to bitcoin by traditional investment methods. they are not the smart money this time, they are the dumb money. dumb money is not shorting a bull run.

i started investing into bitcoin second quarter 2013. i bought my bitcoins from a local exchange and there was a hudge price difference between my local exchange and mt.gox. so i tried to discover how i could make a profit of this. after spending an hour or so on the internet searching for mt.gox arbitrage, it was obvious that the exchange is in serious trouble. that was in second quarter of 2013, long before the exchange closed the doors. 
the closure of mt.gox was a big blow up for the bitcoin community. loss of reputation, loss of funds of small investors. it required a long time for the community to recover. big investors lost interest, only believers stayed tuned. the growth after this blow up basically came from paycheck to paycheck by small investors.
during the run up to 1200 there was also some liquidity crisis. i checked different exchanges during that time and most of them run "out of coins" for a couple of hours, but the demand kept going. 
the liquidity problem is unfortunately not solved yet. we had 2 liquidity crisis recently and the market is not mature enough to handle these liquidity spikes properly. that is to some extent due to the old financial system where it takes ages to do wire transfers. my expectation is, that we will see more of these liquidity spikes in the near future. big money is joining and most of these investors are buying at GDAX or Gemini because of regulations. this will lead to market distortion between exchanges that have many coins and exchanges with less coins. 
fun fact. the exchanges using tether can solve liquidity problems almost immedialty, while the exchanges that do not use tether have to wait for wire transfers to complete to solve their liquidity problems.

you used a small gold nugget which is in relation to the gold above ground very small and has not a significant impact on the price (while it still has).

bitcoin is something i would call an ubiquitous asset spanning around all currently known asset classes.
to answer your question i would focus on the cash branch.
let me define 4 cash categories. each of these categories have two fundamental requirements. bitcoin needs to be able (technology) to handle it and bitcoin needs to be liquid (in $ terms) enough to settle the payments.
* A-A: app-to-app 
think about micropayments. your browser paying every time you access content on news sites, or paying every minute of listening to a song, owning the song after you listened it once completely. or paying a movie per minute and owning it after watching it completely. paying water by cubicmetre, or power by kWh. there are thousands of usecases which would lead to billions of transactions per second.
tech ready: nope
liquid enough: sure
* P-P: peer-to-peer 
this is the visa/mastercard payment stuff. using bitcoin for daily transactions. for rent, utility, food, coffee. we all know the number of transactions done by visa/mastercard and we know that bitcoin cant handle this amount of transaction yet.
tech ready: nope
liquid enough: sure
* C-C: company-to-company 
this should be separated into 2 categories, but the domestic part is mostly useless until bitcoin replaces local currencies. so i focus on the second category which is international. international payments are a mess. a huge mess. they are costly and slow, depend on currency conversion, are exposed to volatility between currencies and needs to be secured against this volatility. if your company needs to do international C-C payments, then you better use a bank for that purpose where you have to pay high fees. enters bitcoin. with bitcoin you could avoid all this pain, but you need to be able to hedge against the volatility of bitcoin. you need futures, shorts and longs for the buyer and seller on both ends of the trade.
tech ready: yes
liquid enough: for small caps yes, for large caps nope; feasible when futures are available
* B-B: bank-to-bank 
now here is where the ball gets rolling. bank to bank international settlements. jamie dimon recently said that JPM is doing more then $ 6 trillion dollar international settlements per day. he told the audience that it is "cheap". but if bitcoin would be used by banks properly, JPM could do all it's international settlement with a single bitcoin transaction. whatever jamie dimon thinks is "cheap", it would not be on the level of "cheap" like bitcoin could provide. and it gets even better for banks. there are an incredible amount of domestic regulation that banks have to comply with. on top of this they also have to comply to foreign regulations if they want to trade in that foreign currency. and they have to have subsidiaries in these countries, etc, etc. banks could get rid of most of this mess if they start to use bitcoin instead of foreign currencies to handle international settlements. the tech is ready for this usecase, but the liquidity is not available. bitcoin could not even provide the liquidity for one single bank, JPM, leave alone the international trade of the whole globe. i have no idea what price would be required to get this liquidity. my personal guess is that it takes at least $ 1 trillion per bitcoin.
tech ready: yes
liquid enough: not even close
so, having this in mind, i don't think that shorting bitcoin is what wallstreet is going todo.

basically true. but not zero. let's say you need a cent.
the price is only a price when someone actually buys it at one million.
so, when someone buy bitcoin worth a cent at a million price, then we actually have a price of one million per bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-12 23:28:46
you are mixing two things together which seem to be related but they are not.
the first thing is the amount of debt. debt always equals wealth. if you build up a society with privatized pension funds, which means everbody is forced to accommodate wealth to have a living when they are old, then you are also forced to build debt as a society, by the same amount. there is no way to avoid it, because debt always equals wealth.
the only option would be to switch to a redistribution pension system where the working class is paying the pension for the old directly, but the current global development is that more and more societies that used redistribution based pension systems are moving into debt/wealth based pension systems.
whatever system you choose, it doesn't have an impact at all on the pension that could be payed to the old. in both systems, pensions can only be payed by a percentage of the GDP which the working people generate. in the redistribution system it is payed directly to the old, in the debt/wealth based system by paying back debt.
there seems to be some common missunderstanding that huge amount of debt might be some problem, while in reality it is not, because there is always the same amount of wealth in existance. if you want to reduce debt then you also have to reduce wealth by the same amount.
debit and credit, wealth and debt, are always a zero sum game:
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:41:49
you can assign any value that you would like to warren buffett. it just doesnt matter. but whatever value you assign to him, there will be exaclty the same amount of debt.

we all want to buy coffee at one time in the future using bitcoin. but bitcoin is more then that.
bitcoin is cash on a global scale. 
that means it has to function not only for personal purchases, it also has to work for internation trade, international banking and even central banking. to be able to handle the global trade bitcoin has to provide sufficient liquidity. the price for 1 bitcoin has to be at least $ 1 trillion per bitcoin to provide this liquidity.
i think we will use sub satoshis on a sidechain or on lightning network or whatever technology will be available at that point in time.

@_date: 2017-12-06 01:56:33
it sounds like you believe that whenever someone buys bitcoin, that the amount of money used to buy it is vanishing?
thats not the case. if you buy a bitcoin now for $ 12000, then the $ 12000 are still there. they do not vanish. so trying to compare a market cap with existing value is not ~~honest~~ useful.
edit: sorry, used the wrong wording, english not my first language.

the leverage to bring the BTC spot price up is way bigger then the leverage to bring the price down.
someone spending some millions into BTC spot can easily kill all cash settled shorts.
wallstreet guys are lonesome wolves. if 10 meet together to bring the price down, at least one will bet against it in secret and win, because he got the bigger lever on the spot market.

what you are basically trying to say is:
running lightning within a docker container running on a linux VM on virtualbox which is running on hypher-v hosted on an ESX server on the amazon cloud is not adding any additional attack vectors because PGP.
if you still dont see how additional layers add additional attack vectors, then i am lost. i have no idea how to explain it any further.

sound money does not exist, because nothing has intrinsic value. everything has only utility and this can differ dependent on scientific or social developments.
everything that exists has proof-of-work. if it does not have proof-of-work then it does not exist.
the first money created by humans has been ledgers put into stones. the only reason why it got dismissed was, that it could not be synchronized over long distances. the concept of money being a ledger got re-invented by the medici. they managed to keep the ledger in sync over long distances but at that time it was not useful to sync the ledger in short distances, so we got stuck with coins being used for short distances and ledgers being used for long distances.
bitcoin brings us back to the first money that ever existed. a ledger, but this time we can sync it between long distances because of technology.

i am not comfortable with your suggestion that miners are a charity club. the question that needs to be answered is, why there was so many hashing power dedicated to bcash while it was not profitable by normal messures. i am open for your arguments, but just saying they are doing it for charity is not usefull.

ok, it was not my goal to discredit any real person. when i say miner i am referencing to some kind of hardware/software and not the person running it. maybe i should have been clarifying the context. i will stick with my type of definition and i would suggest you should do it too. the miner (hardware/software) could be hacked, even if the person that is running the miner was an honest person, the hacked miner could be used for evil stuff. so using the subject miner as a reference to some real person might be not a good idea.

i am part of the community and i would vote against every 2mb hardfork request that would be raised to solve a scaling issue. just raising the blocksize limit is not a valid scaling solution. i hope that whoever is maintaining the leading cryptocurrency now and in the future is only taking requests into consideration that are sound. and not some fundamentaly flawed requests raised by profit only seeking miners or get rich quick community individuals.

from my experience, running 4 nodes in VMs instead of containers on a SOHO NAS would lead to a very busy NAS. whats your current CPU usage on the host?
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:00:02
i am still undecided about what is going to happen. but there is one thing i am sure about. if the split is happening and the majority of miners go with segwit2x. then the same thing that happened with bitcoin cash will happen with the "bitcoin core" blockchain. the miners will switch back for profits and the bitcoin core blockchain will be the longest chain again which could whipe out segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:04:55
there is no sutch thing like legacy bitcoin and miners will mine any chain as long as it is more profitable. so we will end up with 3 chains which they switch whenever they want, bitcoin, b2x and bch.

basically. blockchain is not made for small transactions. only second layer protocols could realistically solve this issue.
* as long as fees are low, you could abuse the blockchain and bloat it with useless information.
of course you could just increase the blocksize to make your payment cheap again, but ...

@_date: 2017-08-26 21:19:29
i dont believe that. you have to keep in mind that they would need a majority of miners to be successful. and it needs to be the majority of all sha-256 miners, so even miners that would normaly stick on the bitcoin blockchain out of loyality could switch during the hardfork attempt to sabotage it.
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:28:53
i can't see any other solution to this problem. all technical solutions cannot be discussed with the communities because of hate and whatnot. the majority of the miners is only interested in profits, they wont solve the problem by themself. the only option that is left in my opinion is price discovery on the markets.

if this would be true, then i would start mining BCH with my android mobile. i would just wait until the difficulty drops to a level that my mobile could mine 100 blocks per second. i would then generate a chain which would be longer then the current BCH chain and would release it to the public.

@_date: 2017-08-25 12:39:59
it will greatly reduce the impact on bitcoin hashrate. with the BCH difficulty right now it takes the miners ~2-3 days to complete a full 2016 cycle. when the BCH price drops the miners will only start mining with a lower difficulty which will reduce the 2-3 days to maybe 1 day, or even less then one day. so the timewindows where the miners stick with the BCH chain will get smaller and smaller. after a full 2016 cycle on BCH we can expect that miners will switch to BTC chain because they have to wait for EDA to kick in again.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:03:33
good point.
if the miners go with the community, for example because they could re-use their hardware would be an option.
another option would be if you would have a hudge enough community with alot of nodes available. then you could force the miners out of business.
but to be honest, i am not a "hardfork expert". maybe someone from an altcoin that went through this trouble might have more insight.

this is something i do not understand. big blockers tend to think in boxes and they always find boxes that fit their usecase.
they think bitcoin is money and look at the current money transactions. they refer to visa and mastercard. that is not what bitcoin is. bitcoin allows to be more then crappy old outdated traditional banking bu**it. trying to scale against an outdated system is not what you should been looking for. you need to find a scaling solution that can provide scaling for the use cases that have never been posible until bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-08-30 13:04:17
they are not getting that suggested x16 profit increase anymore. we could expect that all miners on the BCH blockchain are asicboost miners. so, none of them gets a benefit against another miner that is not using asicboost on the same chain.
the reason i brought up the benefit comparison is, that the formular used to calculate profitability between BTC and BCH is missing the asicboost benefit in regards to consumed resources. it only compares required hashing power and current price, but not cost which are lower with asicboost.
i dont believe that the intention of the miners is to keep BCH alive. they would have to produce 2 different mining rigs in the future, one for BTC and one for BCH. thats why i called it an exit scam for their hardware.
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:29:10

the price will drop and there is almost no economic activity on the blockchain, so fees wont help either. my conclusion is, that it will take longer to be profitable again to switch mining.

if you own money you can decide what to do with it. you can keep it at home or you can put it into a bank account. when you have it in your bank account you dont have it at your pocket anymore, but you can now use it conveniently to pay for bills, online markets and so on. using lightning channels is similar. you put some of your bitcoins into lightning channels to pay with less fees, instantly etc. but as long as your bitcoins are in your lightning channels you dont have them in your normal bitcoin wallet. and like you can go to your bank and clear your bank account, you can also close your lightning channel and get back your bitcoins into your normal wallet.

yes. all current wallets generate new recipient address automatically after they received a payment. regarding coinbase, i am not a customer of them, but i would expect that when you go into their receive menu, that you would get a new receive address after you used the previous one.
the increased fees are not relevant when you sent multiple times to one address, they are relevant when you want to spent coins from an address which received multiple payments.

this discussion about control didn't start with segwit and blocksize increase. it started years ago when there where hearings about bitcoin regulation in the US. all the postings here on reddit about regulation is good, the big boys will then be able to enter the party and stuff like this was a clear sign how all technical discussions will end up in the future.

my quote about "trust all or none" was a response to someone who wrote that some miners are honest and can be truested. i responded that you cant trust some miners while not trusting others. you have to trust all or none, of course with the implication that you cant trust any.
i am following bitcoin since mid 2013, have read the whitepaper and find it quite surprising that you are suggesting that i should do mining. could you please be more specific how i should mine without generating a loss? and please take also into account what the profit would be when i did not mine but buy bitcoins and hold them instead. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:05:06
this is true, but i think the way you described it could potentialy lead into a wrong assumption. we can see that decentralization is working quite ok with a very limited number of central nodes by looking to the torrent network. the reason why this is still working is, that you can just boot a new central node anywhere on the planet, any time. so, even when you can trust a network with limited nodes, the reason for this is the amount of resources required to boot up more nodes in case someone want to take control over it.

if you point to an altcoin, then BCH is the worst decision. the BCH bank is closing every now and then for 6 hours at least and while the bank is closed any amount of transaction fee wont help you.
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:36:07
you just tried to explain to me that the difficulty would be adjusted even if no block has been mined. if this would be true then i could disconnect my mobile from all networks and could let it mine on its own until the difficulty would be so low that i could generate a longer chain then the current BCH chain and this chain would be valid. 
EDA does not work how you believe it does. EDA it triggered when a block is acutally mined. as long as no block is mined there is no EDA.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:42:54
just increasing the blocksize would require a hardfork which the core devs expected to be contentious. so, the core devs came to the consesus to put blocksize increase and segwit together into a softfork.
some of the contentious results of a hardfork we are currently seeing in real time.

no i did not miss it. nobody can attack a transaction of block  every hash power attack is always related to the number of block you are willing to wait. if you wait long enough then a hash power attack cannot be successful.

@_date: 2017-08-24 12:24:53
so, my answer will not be appreciated, but the markets are going to solve this issue in one way or the other.
solution a)
price of bitcoin will fall significantly. miners will stay on the bcash chain and the oscillations will flaten out.
solution b)
price of bcash will fall significantly. miners still will switch to bcash when it generates more profit, but the difficulty will be mutch lower. this will lead to mulitple blocks per minute and a full 2016 cycle will be done in a couple of hours, which will reduce the impact on bitcoin and will further downgrade the price of bcash.
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:17:34
i did also not mention every other non-market solution to this problem that came to my mind and there are a'lot. but they all wont work here. or do you believe that the miners that prevented segwit for almost one year from happening because they would loose profits, would now support a hardfork for bcash while they are milking the holy cow?
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:12:17
you might have a good point. my knowledge about how and when you can use asicboost on BTC are limited.
but there is still this problem that there was way to mutch hashing power directed to BCH when the profitability was ~15% below BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:23:16
yes, the minority chain will be very inconvenient. it may even be completely inpractible and unusable. all i wanted to point out is, that it is not impossible to have secure transactions on a minority chain.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:22:57
by profit margin i mean:
- they can't sell the new BCH immediatly
- when they sell the price will move 
they will not switch immediatly to the more profitable chain, because they have to take the loss of confidence into consideration.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:55:02
not to mention that core does not drive anything. it is the users who drive the car and the users decide which car to take and they currently seem to prefer the car made by core.

now i am lost. maybe it is because english is not my first language. let me explain what i understood so far.
luke-jr mentiond a patent in china. 
you responded that it is a patent application.
i put your comment in question, because as long as the patent is not disapproved it just doesnt matter. as long as a patent is pending no manufacturer is going to put millions into new hardware designs which will be worthless after the patent got approved.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:52:51
sorry, i've missread your previous comment and didnt realize that you mentioned invalid blocks. about invalid blocks all i can say is that my SPV client is connected to my core node which is taking care that i cannot be tricked by invalid blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:51:07
i am undecided which part of your comment i like the best ;-)
well spoken. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:37:03
miners are 100% profit seeking and do not care about anything else then profit. that can actually been seen by the mining game they are doing with bitcoin and bitcoin cash. the trust you should put into miners to stick with any agreement is zero. they do whatever will increase their profit and nothing else.
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:57:08
if you have to decide between a less secure bitcoin or a corporate controlled bitcoin, then its getting hard to come to a decision which one to use. for myself, i would never use a corporate controlled cryptocurrency.

that does not work in a world with finite resources and finite hashing power. we consider transactions to be secure right now with an age of 6 blocks. if we increase this value to 60 or 600 then the game you just described will just collapse.
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:41:19
i believe there is some missunderstanding. the case i described with my mobile is not what i think how EDA is working. it was an example in response to the false assumption of u/bigsexy420 
of course i would not be able to mine anything on my mobile because the EDA would (almost) never kick in on it.

i've just read your reference about US military costs for germany. thanks for the link. i would like to point out some additional information that are not covered by this article but i think you should take them into consideration when evaluating the costs.
there are a couple of strategically very important US military facilities located in germany that basically have almost nothing todo with basic european defense or anything of this matter.
one of the most important overseas airbase is located in germany. it is mainly used to cover operations in the near/middle east. it is also used for the US drone programs for that region.
also one of the main military medical centers is located in germany. main usage currently is also for all near/middle east missions.
and last but not least we have the DECIX in germany which covers almost all european and most of arabic internet traffic. so, unfortunately, we also have some important intelligence units here.
another topic of the article is about excess military facilities in germany that are no longer in use because of troops reductions. what the article is missing is, that these facilities, buildings and the plots has been given to the US by germany at no cost in the 1950/60.
as i already said, the truth is most times complex.
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:34:05
if the price drops by multitudes, then there is a loss of confidence. if the difficulty drops to a level that mining would be profitable again, miners wont switch until the profit margin would outweigh the loss of confidence.

@_date: 2017-08-25 17:55:57
i personally dont have a problem with 3 blocks an hour or 1 block an hour. as miners only seek for profit and nothing else this was expected to happen. they do not care about anything but profits. that is true for the bitcoin blockchain and for any agreement they might have signed.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:08:11
ok, understood. a 24 core unit should easily be able to handle the load. thanks for sharing the information.
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:43:39
as far as i can tell, that is exactly the problem. by all meaningful observations of the nodes out there, one could imagine that "the people" would like to have segwit since almost a year. but that is not a valid way to measure. bitcoin, the platform, the project, the protocol, the code,  still needs to find a way to come to this consensus, but i dont have an idea how this could be solved right now. one thing is for sure, letting the miners decide is not going well right now.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:15:07
english is not my primary languange, so, sorry if this was missleading. what would be the wording if the core devs, after putting all pro and contra arguments together, doing test samples and studies about impacts and effects, came together and voted by majority for this kind of solution. is "coming to consesus" missleading?
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:06:02
ok, lets reference just the screenshot you posted. maybe there is some data missing which is not covered by the screenshot. what is see is:
* 10 BTC 4xxx
* 10 ETH 2xx
* 100 BAT 0.2xxx
* 110 VRC 0.2xxx
so, VRC which is displayed with 110 coins at a price of 0.2 is worth almost as mutch as 10 BTC at 4K. that cant be true ;-)

my node, where my SPV wallet is connected to, will not take any of these blocks as valid. PoW in the context of a blockchain is more then just spamming invalid blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:20:59
no. it is less secure because you have to wait for a longer time to have a secure transaction. this time might be very long without a question, but at some point in time your transaction will be secure, even with only 10% hashpower or even with less. that was the bad part of beeing on a minor hashrate chain, but here comes the good part. when 2nd layer protocols are enabled and you only need one bitcoin transaction to do any amount of 2nd layer transaction, then its easy to wait it out to have a secure transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:51:08
maybe you can point me to the video you did listen, because the video the OP posted is telling different. he is not talking about speed of light in between miners. he is talking about speed of light in regards to transactions that needs to be propagated through the network and the propagation of the resulting block where this transaction is kept back to the source of the transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:12:37

maybe you should read the history of this thread instead of insulting innocent people. the point was, that *I* mentioned that miners cannot be trusted. let me cite myself:


that was the whole reason for the discussion and i tried to explain why this is my opinion.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:36:13
lets assume something or someone would be able to force somehow to re-org the last 100 blocks.
despite the discussion about, if this was a valid re-org or not, it would be useful to have the old pre-re-org state of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:29:15
funny, how nobody is even taking into consideration that it could be a BTC drop ;-)
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:47:03
yes. absolutely. i tried to cover this by saying "seem to prefer". english is not my first language, but i tried my best to cover this topic.
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:44:37
i tried to find a reason why more miners run on the BCH blockchain then it would have been necessary to maintain the chain when it was less profitable then mining on the BTC blockchain.
and yes, i think BCH is an exit scam for the now outdated mining hardware that can no longer get a benefit mining BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:43:13
we havent seen a drop by multitudes on the price of BTC or BCH since the fork. that was my presumption to call it a loss in confidence.
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:10:10
if you are using a SPV wallet, like a wallet for a mobile, you are already trusting another party. some SPV wallets allow to configure which node to trust, but most users dont use that functionality and dont run an own node which they could use to connect the SPV wallet to. it is actually good for the bitcoin network to have an incentive for the users to own a full node. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:22:10

@_date: 2017-08-31 16:32:27
ok, then my question would have been better asked for the database and data files. but i hope an experienced core developer is still able to understand the reason for my question :)
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:32:34
ok, then let me rephrase my sentence.
correct me if i am wrong. but to prove, you personaly need to have a node which runs bitcoin, is powered on, is connected to the internet and downloaded the full blockchain and validated all transactions. if you dont prove by yourself then you need a trusted third party. but if you would like to trust a third party then you could simply use paypal.
which is basically what i have said before, but this time for pedants.
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:30:08
you got me. true.
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:13:11
i am not comfortable with your finding. if the people would have been able to lead the development, then i would assume that we would have had segwit since a year and we would never have had a hardfork and we would almost all be happy. not everbody of us, but the most of us.
edit: by development i mean the development of bitcoin as platform/protocol, not development as in writing code.
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:46:17
i've found some more pieces and have re-read the BIP proposal. from a pure technical perspective this BIP is now implemented and/or cannot be implemented anymore as described. the main purpose of this BIP is to:


but this is a problem since segwit. first, there is no MAX_BLOCK_SIZE anymore, it is now called MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT. and the second issue with this BIP is, that the MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT is set to 4000000 and this BIP would now decrease the maximum block capacity. i dont believe that this would be appropriate to reduce the capacity right now.
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:03:22
i believe i see where i got lost.
luke-jr mentioned the asicboost patent
you responded that the serial power layout is only a patent application.
so, you have been talking about a different patent then the one luke-jr mentioned, while i understood that you are talking about asicboost either.
sorry, my mistake.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:16:24
what we currently see is some kind of the future of bitcoin if it succeeds. that might sound frightening but my expectation is that there is no way around. when bitcoin price will hit a significant valuation, like some millions per bitcoin, the "big players" will be able to join the party because there will be enough liquidity to make big player trades possible. when this happens, and these folks dont care about transaction costs, then all our small transactions will have to fight for limited blocksize capacity against these folks. however big the blocksize will be at that moment, it would be too small to cover all involved parties.
my assuption now is, that alot of "normal players" are currently in the same situation like the "big players" in the future. they want to have transactions done and dont care about the costs. the reason for these players is, that they want to split their bitcoin wallets and bitcoin cash wallets with the intention to sell one of these which will cover their loss due to the fees, so they dont care about it.

@_date: 2017-08-10 06:14:54

that comes to my surprise. i never brought them together with any significant software project. do you have references?
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:00:01
i still do not understand what they think how this should play out positive for bcash.
they always have to mine with less revenue then bitcoin. if the revenue for mining bcash turns above bitcoin then all miners will switch to bcash and we already know how this plays out.
so, their goal might be to mine with just some smaller revenue then bitcoin. but then they are at the risk that a small price correction on bitcoin might again lead to ... 
and even if they can handle to always stay just below the revenue for mining bitcoin then they have to throw more and more and more hashing power to bcash if the price of bcash appreciates. they end up stacking mining power to a chain which is cursed to mine at lower profit rate.
i dont get it why they are keeping it alive.

the reason is that bitcoin is an ubiquitous asset.
* stock, if you see bitcoin as a platform
* bond, this will eventually happen after volatility is gone
* commodity, it is scarce
* real estate, most real estate is owned for speculation or inflation protection
and now the important part which will prevent the crash.
* cash
the rising price will make bitcoin a feasible tool to settle international trades. the more the price rise the more business types can use the platform. right now small and med cap companies should be able to use bitcoin for international settlements, but with a rising price this opportunity will be available for large cap companies, banks and finaly for central banks. this usecase is completely decoupled from speculation and will prevent a massive crash like it would be possible for a pure speculative asset.

right now we assume that a transaction that has an age of 6 blocks is considered to be secure. all you have todo on a 10% minority chain is to wait as many blocks as the 90% of the remaining hashpower would be able to build in the same time as your 10% minority chain needs to build 6 blocks and you can call this transaction then secure even on your minority chain.

i used to think that goverments will try to intervene long time ago, but changed my mind.
governments, or better politicians, are not completely independent. i wont call them corrupt, but they are somehow dependent on the rich. in the near future more and more of the existing wealth will migrate into bitcoin. the rich will become heavily invested into bitcoin. this will prevent bitcoin to be attacked by politicians as they would have to go against the rich. i dont believe that this is going to happen.
there will still be subversive attacks, maybe from government agencies, against the inclusion of technology that would allow anonymous transactions. attacks like we have seen with the blocksize debate the last year. but i dont expect public attacks of politicians, as this might cost them their job.

not sure what the expectation of some people here is, but my expectation is, that bitcoin is going to absorb all existing wealth in the long term.
during the whole human history, there has never been more debt then wealth, not even for a microsecond.
debt = wealth
not more, not less, it's even, has always been even and will be even for a very long time ahead.
so if we all want that all existing wealth is going to migrate into bitcoin, then there is no way to avoid that all debt will be the exact opposite of bitcoin. there is no way that bitcoin can gain value without existing debt or new debt.

governments are not going to go against bitcoin directly. if they do, then only subversive.
when bitcoin grows until it would be a threat to governments, the rich will be heavily invested into bitcoin. politicians tend not to go against the rich, because they know it might cost them their job when they do so.
there is a very long way to go until bitcoin reaches a level where it could be a threat to governments. by that time, bitcoin will be used globally at least for international trade. that also means, that central banks have bought bitcoin. central banks of countries that do imports/exports have to have foreign currencies as a reserve to protect their industry from heavy price swings.
so, at that time when bitcoin has grown to be a threat, you have central banks invested into bitcoin and the rich invested into bitcoin. i dont see politicians going against bitcoin at that time.

a cryptographic consensus is in essence a social consensus which can be broken anytime.
if a significant number of cryptographic experts consider some type of math to be unprobable to be hacked in a timely manner, then a consesus is formed to consider this cryptographic algorithm as secure. but any new mathematically development could make this consensus invalid.
there is no cryptographic consensus without a previous social consensus.
the whole bitcoin software is nothing but a social consensus. about block sizes, algos to be used, OP codes to be valid and so on. whenever the bitcoin network, which is a result of the software, is used, these previously defined rules are enforced.
whatever you think bitcoin is, its not. the cryptographic consensus of the network can be changed anytime if a social consesus could be reached by using a new software that is changing the rules.
that has been done already in the past for security reasons and will happen again in the future.

yeah, it kinda looks like, but there is some magic's working in the background that even bitcoin cannot circumvent.
the global financial system, which is at it's root a global ledger of "who owns what", is based on double-entry bookkeeping. that means everything that is accounted as debit will always have the same amount of credit. credit without debit or in your example debit without credit cannot exist by definition. so for a new minted bitcoin to be able to increase the market cap 
 of bitcoin when it was minted is only possible if the credit site of the global balance sheet even's out afterwards again. this can be achieved by 2 methods. increase the credit side by the same amount or reduce the debit side somewhere else by the same amount, for example by reducing the market cap of another crypto or another asset. the most stable way to even out the balance sheet, without reducing the value of the dollar or stocks or commodities would be to just increase the credit site of the global balance sheet. if you do it this way, then nothing would have to lose value while bitcoin could increase it's market cap.
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:15:59
i'm not a tax expert, but AFAIK all crypto usage, which also means buying crypto itself, is VAT exempt. only if you realize capital gains, and then it also doesn't matter how you realized the gains, you have to pay taxes (spekulationssteuer) on the capital gains.

that cant exist in a capitalism system. you would have to banish capitalism to get a stable pricing system. 
capitalism is transfering wealth into machines/technology to increase productivity. this increased productivity will always have an impact on the price level. you cant just increase the amount of goods and services by using better machines/technology without an impact on the prices. so, if you want to live in a capitalism society you have to end up with a money system that requires adjustments from time to time.

pleasing authorities is not the way for success on this topic. no significant multinational commerce would use a blockchain that would not be immutable. if you want the big boys on board, the blockchain has to be 100% immutable. you can still implement second layers for payement processors that could do transactions rollbacks, but never think about applying this to the blockchain itself.

now i am somehow lost. the beginning of the discussion was about bitcoin providing stable prices. which i think it could if you adjust velocity.
i never suggested that it can be stable without intervention. :)
sure, it cant provide stable prices without adjustment. but it can provide stable prices with adjustment. just not with adjustments at the supply but adjustments at the velocity.

the $ value does not drop because people buy stuff. especially not when people use their currency to buy assets, like bitcoin.
it is indeed a zero sum game, but not the way you are refering to. every debit, like bitcoin or the dollar, has the same amount of credit. the dollar and bitcoin are both on the debit side of the sheet. you only have to increase the credit by the same amount the bitcoin marketcap increases and you have a stable dollar.
the market cap can easily increase by trillions. you just have to expand the credit side of the global balance sheet.

the suggested million is still not enough. a currency is a unit of account. bitcoin can only be a unit of account if it gains some equilibrium in price. now the question is, when will bitcoin reach this equilibrium in price?
it first has to fullfill all the other roles that it provides in the financial market before it can reach the equilibrium.
now what other roles does it provide?
with my limited knowledge about financial markets i would seperate the financial world into 2 categories:
* 1) stuff that gets bought because of financial gains
* 2) stuff that gets bought because of financial stability (inflation, etc)
bitcoin will provide both for a very long time ahead. almost all "investments" from the categories above would need to be transfered into bitcoin until we would reach price equilibrium, which basically means, all existing global wealth would need to be migrated into bitcoin. there will be volatility again and again until this migration has been completed.
and then there is an additional effect. while more and more wealthy people migrate their old wealth into bitcoin, the old wealth (dollars) will be kept by less and less insanly rich people. we will see new trillionairs every morning. this means that the rich people left behind will buy bitcoins for incredible amounts of old wealth.
what will be the price at the end? well, i would say, it doesnt matter at that point.

as i have already mentioned before. it does not only depend on supply, it also depends on velocity. as the current central bank system only relies on supply, i dont see why bitcoin which would only rely on velocity should not also work.
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:37:34
there is also another indicator. if you look the other way around. smart money will migrate in waves from the current "wealth" system into bitcoin (cryptocurrency). that leaves more of the old kind of wealth for fewer rich people (some of them have migrated to the new kind of wealth).
as long as we dont see skyrocketing prices for old wealth storage vehicles, like diamonds, gold, silver, real estate, paintings, stocks etc. we are still in the early adopter phase.
my expection is that all old wealth storage vehicles will be abondend on the way to mass adoption. each of them have some property similiar to bitcoin but none of them have all the properties that bitcoin has. 
you could imagine, if this happens, what the price for one satoshi would be ...

bitcoin will gain the most traction first in markets where it could provide the most benefit, which is international money transmitting for global players. (not remittances)

only if credit is expanded.
let's say credit would not be expanded then you would have increased the supply of bitcoins after a new block got mined but you would not have increased the potential demand for it. the market cap of bitcoin in dollar terms would stay the same and the price per bitcoin would decrease by a slight amount. there are now more bitcoins that share the same market cap in dollar terms like before.

as far as i know they have implemented "wipeout protection". they expect a certain block to have a specific size which would be bigger then whats currently allowed on the bitcoin blockchain. if this block is not found on the longest chain then this chain is considered to be invalid. this would prevent segwit2x to be wiped out by a segwit blockchain gaining more PoW.

now i wrote a long reply and didn't even consider your question about inflation °°
it does not have to create inflation. the amount of debit/credit is not neccessarily creating inflation. you could, with proper policies, increase the debit/credit while keeping the inflation low. the inflation rate is more correlated to the increase of wages in relation to the increase of productivity. so if you keep the wage increase in control then you won't have inflation go nuts while still being able to increase debit/credit.

first of all you have to trust that the general docker binaries are not malicious. then you have to trust that the very specific docker binaries that has been used by the developer who created the container are not malicious. you also put additional host operating system layers in place which gives an attacker additional vectors to compromise your system. you also have to add a whole bunch of additional software to maintain your container, all opening additional attack surfaces.

proof-of-passport is not solving sybil attacks problems. it only reduces the actors that could start a sybil attack to state actors.
i also have to disagree with the get rich quick scheme. my expectation is, that the real potential of bitcoins will be unleashed when global trading by multinational enterprises will be done by using bitcoins. no enterprise will ever use any kind of public blockchain if it is not 100% anonymous. they would basically kill themself if their competitors could see what they buy and where they invest. anonymity is a fundamental part that needs to be established before bitcoin really can take off.

i cant imagine that this might be possible. to some level the system might solve it by itself. decreasing price level which give the masses the ability to buy more which could lead to the rich to invest more into production because there is a bigger market. but without adjustment at all, i dont think that this would be possible.

i've never mentioned that capital gains are not taxed anywhere. i've always said that crypto is only VAT exempt. i actually tried to point out that the title of the OPs post is missleading because it would suggest that crypto is tax free, which is not the case. you have to pay capital gains tax if you don't hold your crypto for at least one year.

please have a look also into nLockTime'd bitcoins and hardforks. hardforks could have an impact on your locked bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:17:35
in germany the tax is 0% if you are not trading your bitcoin for at least one year.
and it is FIFO.

the "general public" learned in elementary school about orders of magnitude and metric prefixes. they learned how to scale properly.
other people learned inches and never learned howto scale. so when they run out of inches the used foots, and when foots wasnt enough they used yards, and when yards wasnt enough they used miles ...
... and because that wasnt enough, they are now trying to establish the same on bitcoin ...

It is true. The time it Takes for a Block from one miner on one side of the earth to reach another miner on the other side of the earth will increase with a bigger blocksize. This would give miners on one side an Advantage over miners on the other side and increase centralization.

decentralized bank? really?
it looks like every bullshit is getting upvoted as long as binance is part of the subject.

i cant follow your argument, that having a clean docker container on a malicious host is somehow more secure or usefull. if your host is compromised then it just doesnt matter if the container is clean or not. you have to make sure that your host and your libraries are not compromised with or without docker.

the value of global M3 in bitcoins will tend to zero, yes.

they are only doing the pre-ICO right now. but as far as i understand you can modify it to whatever you want. you just have to pay the required TSC.
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:15:01
i downvoted without comment, because you are cherry picking one time events, complain about topics that can be refuted by doing 2 minutes of research or bring up stupid argument.
TLDR: you are not worth my time.
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:05:01
not in your account. but in the account from where you bought your bitcoins.

they are actually operating with higher fees then required and shift the overcharge into the SAFU to pay for their broken opsec.
@_date: 2019-05-08 00:53:30
according to their own news release:
" Hackers were able to obtain a large number of user API keys, 2FA codes, and potentially other info "
that does not sound like something that got harvested over some longer period of time. if someone is able to obtain large number of 2FA codes from binance then their opsec is broken beyond repair.
@_date: 2019-05-10 01:43:34
yeah. unfortunately an exchange would be able to run for a very long time with a fraction reserve model, because most traders keep their coins on the exchanges forever.

IMHO the trezor was the better pick.
congrats !

you can lose much faster then you expected, but not more then you have had invested.

just binance selling alt's versus bitcoin until they got 7k BTC.

i would like to provide you with a more secure way to store your funds.
@_date: 2019-05-08 00:38:35
they are using customer funds (trading fees) to create the SAFU to then later pay the loss which was caused by their broken opsec using the SAFU instead of their own money.
am i the only one that find this behaviour questionable instead of good?
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:38:03
if i believe in TA or not is not part of this debate. nobody in this thread is debating about TA. this is about a statement of Tone Vays where he spoke about his worst case szenario prediction about the bitcoin price.
on a site note. you should improve your reading comprehension.
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:52:03
maybe some of the coins in your electrum wallet have been imported using a private key?
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:27:14
i knew that this will be coming :)
but you haven't lost more then you have had invested. bitmex has no credit line and if they would have one it would be part of your investment.
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:22:33
the hacker has 7000 bitcoins to pay the miners to mine in his favour.
i actually dont understand the idea of CZ trying to compete with the hacker. all what CZ would achieve is just losing another 7000 bitcoins on top of the current loss.
@_date: 2019-05-10 01:15:04
i am not 100% familiar with the definitions of the SAFU. as far as i know they use trading fees to setup the fund, so they would have to convert USDT / BNB into BTC anyway at some point.
i am also not sure if the SAFU is even big enough already. i read somewhere that there are only aprox. $13M in the SAFU. so they would have to use own equity anyway to cover the rest of the loss.
@_date: 2019-05-10 01:26:14
the SAFU is a marketing gag to trick simple minded people to glorify binance. binance has the obligation to payback any loss anyway.
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:01:31
binance buying 7000 bitcoins and is using different funds to accumulate.
i hate to say it but i believe that this alt weakness will not last for very long. i hope i am wrong though.

if your system is debian based then you might try to:
\# touch /forcefsck
\# reboot
this should make a forced filesystem check on boot. but be prepared that your system might not survive without damages.
maybe do some backup before executing.
EDIT: the reason to try the filesystem check on boot is, that the filesystem wont be mounted read-write and you wont face the error message you got when the filesystem was mounted read-write.

which business with how many transactions on which blockchain?
your statement is, vaguely, to put it politely.
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:51:06
that is so far from true. as far as i know germany is currently the only country in the world where you have literally a bitcoin bank.

@_date: 2019-05-11 15:09:44
ethereum is a smart contract platform and proclaimed until recently not to be a currency. so, whatever transactions are on ethereum they are not relevant in regards to the bitcoin blockchain.

out of my heart. good luck trying to educate people to understand the nature of money.  i think more then 99% of the people out there do not understand money and i believe that without understanding capitalism, which is also not what 99% of the people believe it is, they wont understand it.
