Energy argument is BS.
Why not ban worthless video on YouTube? Those are even bigger waste of electricity and human time.

Problem with btc to these crooks is that.....It is too transparent. They can hide dirty dealings in private digital currencies where only They can see the transactions.....But They can't hide their dirty deeds if they are using bitcoin.

We should restrict useless cat videos on YouTube while we are at it
That's alot of wasted energy as well.
Seriously....How we use energy is nobody's business as long as nobody is robbing stealing or cheating anyone for that energy.

She's stating the exact reason why govts should ban it. Cuz it will eventually lead back to them.

The satoshi is still very cheap. Lol

Slow speed is true.
But what fees are you talking about?
When was the last time you sent any bitcoin from your own private wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:53:54
If a satoshi by then can purchase you a car...Yeah... ppl are gonna keep mining

Just purchase some bitcoin from him. Then sue him for fraud.

There has got to be enough incentives to entice people to spend their BTC.
If people aren't willing to spend. It just means they believe that saving that capital for the future is more worthwhile than spending it today.
Don't fall into the Keynesian trap of spending for the sake of spending. Come up with ways to make it attractive for people to spend instead of forcing people to spend.

But could it be that deserts began spreading because of the removal of these carbon from the cycle?
And how do you justify your claims? All these are but claims you know? 
Or maybe those claiming global warming(no I'm not gonna use the term climate change....I was taught global warming and depletion of ozone layer in my childhood) could start leading by example and throw away everything that has to do with fossil fuels.
You know...Like the phone we are using to type on this forum. Or maybe that dry fit t shirt some of us are wearing now. You know what I mean.
I don't claim to know everything about the climate....but I just can't stand hypocrisy and virtue signalling.

Live in HK for awhile. U will know what I mean.

Truth to be told. CIA probably funded this to destabilize China.
How else could you explain a place as competitive as Hong Kong you could find people who can do nothing but protest for weeks. Who do you think is paying/feeding them?

Stupid Keynesian arguments.
If you want me to spend those BTC....You'd do better make it worthwhile for me to spend. Instead try to lecture me into spending them.

It's the same as how terror organization operate. How much do u think it costs to keep a fighting force of thousands of people fed and armed doing nothing but training to kill everyday?

Weren't we taught in schools that fossil fuels were formed from dead organic carbon based life form that once roam on earth's surface?
Why would returning the carbon that used to exist on the earth's surface in the carbon cycle suddenly be a problem?
