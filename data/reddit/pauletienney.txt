Imagine that today 1 BTC = 100 USD.
 
Now imagine that for any reason the USD value inscreases (better US economic situation, problem in Russia, whatever ...). It means the same amount of USD can buy more stuff.
So we would have 1,5 BTC = 100 USD.
We would see the BTC price decrease. However the real reason would be that USD is stronger.

We don't need viral, we need bitcoins in front large audience eyes. This button is awesome. In 12 month you will see those buttons on a non negligeable number of blogs. I guess.

It is not necessary but Bitcoin qualities make it convenient. It is cheap, instantly transferable across the globe, divisible, programmable, ...
Those fundamentals are so good, that slowly the bitcoin will take its share in money usage.
As a developper I can imagine hundreds of tools built on bitcoin.

You understand well. Blockchain technology can be forked. I can imagine the euro working with it. The European Central Bank could create some crypto euros and force banks to mine it.

That's my point. This is the first really new service (appart from bitcoins fundamental properties) I see thanks to bitcoin.

Actually, I think it would be huge. Not possible with today tech but imagine you override the touch feeling and simulate. We would have no problem to "touch" things.

No we don't depend on it. However we are compared to it.
It means that if USD become stronger for any reason other currencies will look like weaker. Even if they are in good shape.

This is a big info about one the main actor/competitor of bitcoin ecosystem.
Also you quote contains "usually".

I think the more Bitcoin and r/bitcoin mature, the more we will see posts about general finance situation.

I agree. What I mean is : do not analyse the BTC/USD ratio only with BTC info. You need info about USD too.

Ok thanks. I was a bit too quick.

It seems they are talking about huge changements and opportunities in the payment sector. I think digital currencies are one of them.
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:24:08
I don't say what is important for a currency. I say that we need to get a broader point of view to explain BTC price moves.

Well, I totally understand the "let's build a good product then a business model" since it is the case for many startups.
However, this one handle (some of) our money. 
I would prefer them to show they are solid.

Please elaborate and give examples. Bill Gates in freakingly smart. Do not underestimate him.

I am totally on board if BTC remains between a 100$ range during one full year. Stability.
@_date: 2014-09-26 12:26:13
Not sure it would be that great.
Bitcoin does not authorize pull transaction. You have to push.

I share your opinin. Fundamentals are still excellent.
You can add to this the context : fast spread of 3G/4G networks, quite old fashioned competitors and a whole bunch of people to empower with banking systems.
