So if I put in $1000 and now it’s $2000 and I withdraw the original $1000 I have to pay taxes on that? I’m willing to set aside the money to pay the taxes when I file. I was just wondering if anyone else in this situation knew the answer.

What’s the best way to gift someone some bitcoin if they don’t use it? Do they have to have a bitcoin wallet first? Or at the very least download coinbase?
