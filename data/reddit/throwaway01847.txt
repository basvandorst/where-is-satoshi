Why do I get the feeling he only wrote this to try and sell what is possibly a scam for a 1.5.2 "hack" for 20 BTC.

This is a reminder to always make multiple backups, one backup on a USB is not good enough. Buy a 5-10 pack of usb's from amazon or whatever and fully encrypt each of them with veracrypt and store your seed/encrypted private key on them and just hide them anywhere you want like a friends house or a safety deposit box etc... chances of them guessing your veracrypt password and wallet password are non existent unless you use a shitty password. Shit you could even tattoo your encrypted private key on your leg or arm, as long as you didn't use a shit password your coins will be safe.

Electrum offers Child Pays For Parent and you can set how much you want to add but considering you are doing micro transactions you will most likely spend more in fees than you are paying. 
Personally I try to avoid any micro transactions and I'm happy to pay the $2-3 in fees to send $100 or more.
