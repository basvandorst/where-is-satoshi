I'm generally on board with this train of thought. But, I'm sure global adoption will gravitate towards the least complicated method. While Lightning Network and the Bitcoin blockchain are both complicated under the hood, Lightning Network apps will be the easiest to use for payment, while leaving the most of their money on exchanges. This defeats the purpose of the blockchain, but that's how it is and probably will be. 
For example, people now are perfectly able to use PGP encrypted email; or they have free access to a vast amount of knowledge on the internet, yet still most people prefer lazy solutions in exchange for their data, and watch TV instead of learning. I'm also wondering to what extent Ethereum has already surpassed Bitcoin regarding creating user friendly applications. Or at least having the majority of devs to accomplish that. This will get downvoted, but that's my current sentiment. I'm betting on both horses.

I'm largely ignorant about all of this, but two years ago I used to be able to host a public Insurgency server which regularly hosted 32 concurrent players, and a webserver. Both needed me to forward some ports, which worked. I tried opening those ports again, for instance port 80, but it remains closed.

"The biggest threats to Bitcoin. I think, Bitcoin isn't just a technology, it's also a community. And, actually probably one of the most effective ways of attacking that community is by spreading disinformation, creating dissent, and [creating] arguments and drama within the Bitcoin community. And I would be very surprised if Bitcoin is the first community—that is an activist grassroots community—that is not *fully fully* infiltrated by a whole bunch of intelligence services, and corporate spies, and bullshit artists who are trying to cause problems. Why? Because historically we know that *every* single grassroots activist movement: the environmentalists, the feminists, the anti-war activists—all of them—the communists, the labor unions, have been infiltrated, have been filled with propaganda, have had active agents creating drama. Reddit, I'm talking about you.
So, my advice is: focus on the technology, the technology is real. The drama isn't real, it's completely fake. Some of it is just idiots. Some of it is paid people who are doing this as a job. And I try to pay as little attention to the drama as possible. That's one of the risks for Bitcoin. Fragmentation of the community slows things down. If the brightest programmers we have are spending all day dealing with trolls on Reddit, they're not writing code. Right? And that's a danger for our system." —Andreas Antonopoulos

Currently, I'm only in with the profit I made from my initial investment six months ago; pulled out my original sum. From experience I can tell that's the only way I can get peace of mind during overwhelming frenzies. If I lose the profit, it sucks, but it won't destroy me emotionally. I realize that even if I was all in and lost all my money, it would be a lesson learned and I'd still be alive, but I hugely underestimated the psychological impact of earning money way too fast.

In general, when someone has to rely on credentials to improve the credibility of arguments, the arguments aren't credible.
However, I'm totally ignorant on the whole ordeal. I do not know Roger and for all I know he could be a 'good' or 'bad' guy. Either way, I'm pretty disappointed. All of this nonsense and confusion is a repellant towards cryptocurrency. It's hard enough as it is to convince others. BTC vs BCH makes the whole situation seem juvenile. We're all human, of course, shouting and conflict is to be expected everywhere, but not like this. Just as in agar.io, if you split too much, you get eaten more easily, and then you die. Stop the silliness and start working together. If we're going to let money, greed, and our ego's do the talking, we're going to end up just as the system we are trying to replace.

I recently had to restore a wallet from a seed for the first time. Not out of curiosity but necessity. Boy oh boy was my heart racing when $0 showed up. I thought I fucked up a year ago by sending to a wrong address, but after some soul searching and problem solving, I discovered a segwit address has a m/4**9**'/0'/0' derivation instead of m/44'/0'/0'. Haven't stared into the abyss in years. Also, don't use a Ledger's Fido U2F for accessing accounts that you need when that same Ledger fails. It's easy making stupid, superbly stupid mistakes.

You can compare a seed with a password; you can create thirty wallets—accessing the same addresses, with the same seed. Those wallets don't communicate with each other, they just access the blockchain. If a wallet fails, you need your seed to recover access to the address. That wallet does not know whether your other wallet got lost, or you're just creating a secondary wallet.
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

I think every maximalist has considered that possibility. But what is Satoshi going to do? I'm not an expert in economics, but I don't think he'd be able to permanently destroy Bitcoin. Neither with selling all his coins instantly, or steadily. The longer Satoshi waits with doing something with them, the less influence he can have on the network. And if Bitcoin ends up becoming the global standard store-of-value, and he decides to be an asshole, it's likely that the network will 'vote him out' because he'd be disrupting everyone's wealth. I'm just thinking out loud, and interested in hearing what damage you think he could cause.

In my 5 months of crypto 'experience', whenever the price rose significantly, I FOMO'd and thought "Shit, now it's different and it's never going down again." It always went down.

I do have a question about the last paragraph of the last answer: "Since bitcoins are so divisible, it'd be very unlikely we'd lose every unit of bitcoin after all the coins have been mined. And so long as one unit of bitcoin remains, the protocol could be updated to divide it even more."
Does this mean that the last bitcoin can be 'scaled up', to be viewed as 21 000 000 bitcoins?

Who is your target audience? Because I think most of the terminology will be lost on people who don't know what Bitcoin is, and likely don't even know what money is. If your target audience is the average person I'd make this even simpler still—ELI5 style.
What I always tell people:
1. It's *not* inflationary. The value I earned, worked for, invested time in, will not decrease over time. Conversely, fiat inflationary money with a median inflation of 2.7% (e.g.) means that after 25 years your savings are worth half as much. In other words: the time you spent working for that money is doubly lost because you have to work even more to make up for the decreased buying power.
2. It's secured by math and computing power equivalent to 200 000 times that of the world's top 500 supercomputers combined. Humans are flawed, math and computers aren't.
3. You can take your money anywhere in the world.
4. (Quite esoteric already) It's programmable money; you can command your money to do X if Y happens.
Right now the 'money is important' part is the only section which I think is quite accessible to the public. Anyway, got to go now, I may come up with other stuff later. There's definitely need for an understandable elevator pitch.

If everyone uses that money everyone grows richer.

Because I *think* the incentive to pay for something good trumps the incentive to pay for a shitpost. Moreover, if one considers the fact that it's possible to implement paid upvotes and downvotes, of which the author may earn a fraction, it incentivizes quality posts even more. But that only works if one has to pay to post in the first place, otherwise people will just spam bullshit hoping to get lucky which results in things like Steemit.
