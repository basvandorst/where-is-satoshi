no more than the $30 rise on wednesday
it's bitcoin, it rises, it falls, but the trend is upwards for 2 years now after the crash between 2013-2015. you can't think short term with bitcoin it will drive you crazy
it's higher than it was last week, more than double than it was this time last year, not quite as high as it was in june but close and 3 x the value of jan 2015 - unless you bought recently or 2013 you're in profit!!

yeah absolutely plus with any method other than bank transfer there is an increased risk of scam. i'm not saying it's unreasonable necessarily just saying this is a possible explanation for the high rates he saw as on bank transfer listings the prices are always pretty fair that i have seen

thanks for your responses, they are all good but i was looking for something a little bit more simplistic like coindesk. i was happy with that but it has been loading very erratically since the weekend and the figures have often been out of date / the page was missing things - for example in this pic here it is missing the historical pricing data which shows close price and up or down for last 7 days 
i just want something that a quick glance tells me up or down for the day and previous days and current value in usd and gbp without all the other stuff going on - which i'm sure is good for many but is overkill for what i need!

thanks yeah that looks a lot better for my usage more simplistic like coindesk with less other things going on!! cheers

I was just about to come back on here you know, it's actually sorted.
saved the seeds and electronic back ups to both the wallet i sent from and sent to, but when i reinstalled electrum and restored both wallets from seeds all transactions were in the old one but nothing in the new despite full confirmations.
then 4 hours later i uninstall electrum, reinstall, restore both wallets from seeds again and the coins are sat in the new wallet! bizarre but panic over!!!

i buy and sell on localbitcoins and generally always find the buy listings to be marginally above the current exchange rate and the sell for around the current exchange rate or a bit lower - that is for bank transfer, for paypal / face to face transfers / gift cards etc the rates are ridiculous
but like now for bank transfer the buy is 509.48 GBP / BTC and sell is 499.69 GBP / BTC
