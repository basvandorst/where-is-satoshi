Title talks of journalists shortcomings but text is all economic theory. 
Re: Journalists: this is a critical issue that deserves critical analysis. Talking heads on Bloomberg and CNBC and those writing for CNN Money play a crucial role in shaping public perception. During this adoption phase, perception is creating reality. 
Normally their role is helpful in determining what is news and then summarizing the issues. In the case of Bitcoin they have gone off the tracks. Especially in the last couple weeks. Their subject knowledge shows they have never visited this sub. Coverage is superficial and almost universally dismissive. 
What has had a huge impact is not the quality of coverage, but the quantity. Bloomberg has a Bitcoin piece every quarter hour. They constantly show hockey stick charts, give awe struck recitations of percentage gains, and run screen bottom tickers of “Bitcoin mania”. This is driving millennials to the App Store where they made coinbase the top download. To them, this is about easy money from an app. 
Coinbase, of course, charges a hefty premium for this video game like convenience. 5 to 10 % price premium and 4% purchase fees. But imagine the reaction if there’s a major price correction. All those millennials will think they were cheated. Headlines will attract attention seeking politicians. Regulations will be promulgated and haphazardly enforced. This can’t be good. 
Re: Economic Theory: where is Niall Ferguson when you need him? Strongly recommend everyone here read his book: The Ascent of Money.
