All three are escorted to the dumpster where all trash belongs.
@_date: 2019-12-18 03:34:59
It’s a cesspool if criminals and retards. Just like crypto itself.
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:40:15
Scammers paradise. Especially for me, Nigerian scammer.

Jesus Christ this propaganda is getting out of control. Cringeworthy.
@_date: 2019-12-09 03:48:47
Jesus stop with the endless pumping.
@_date: 2019-12-18 05:28:31
Well it’s the place I find crypto scammers to troll.
@_date: 2019-12-07 13:57:43
Your greed led you down the path to lose it all to a scam. Sorry but you did it to yourself.
@_date: 2019-12-08 14:04:51
What? Buy more bags?its garbage.
@_date: 2019-12-06 15:40:34
More likely crater.
@_date: 2019-12-06 18:55:01
Shows how stupid millennials are.
@_date: 2019-12-07 22:16:57
Offended at being corrected?
@_date: 2019-12-06 18:12:16
ButtCoin is a stupid cult. Sell that crap and use your money for something better than hoping some computer code will “moon”.
@_date: 2019-12-06 18:30:15
Anyone who is so greedy as to ride this shit from zero to $18000 back to $3000 up to $14,000 back to $3000. These people are greedy and stupid. 
Hodling is moronic. And greedy. It also proves that bitcoin is actually useless. No one takes it. No one spends it. It was meant to be a form of payment. Yet no one pays with it. That proves that everyone is hodling it, hindering any use.
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:02:07
That and $1 is still worth $1. A stupid bitcoin stamp on a bill������ hardly an Oracle.
@_date: 2019-12-26 06:06:31
Why do anything? Want to promote your scams. Start your own platform
@_date: 2019-12-06 19:39:23
Just a new account bro.
@_date: 2019-12-06 18:55:24
Omg dude anything CAN go to zero.
@_date: 2019-12-06 15:16:21
As a Nigerian scammer I love  bitcoin? bitcoin and scams certainly pair up perfectly. I’m able to con plenty of people out of their bitcoin.

Why would that globe contain rhodium?  Rhodium is worth $5600 an ounce. Nearly 4 times the price of gold. Globes have no use for containing rhodium.
@_date: 2019-12-06 22:37:39
I can sell gold anywhere on earth instantly. 
I can sell stocks instantly from my phone. 
Real Estate is a far safer investment than this shit.

@_date: 2019-12-06 18:19:58
Locking up your money for years in this shit hoping for a price rise? Jesus Christ the greed. Anything with swings of 20-40% over hours or days is absolutely ludicrous.
@_date: 2019-12-08 13:04:08
@_date: 2019-12-06 22:27:30
No, they troll bitcoin because it’s stupid.
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:50:23
Total and utter scam. Want your bitcoin stolen?
Open this wallet. Give your money away.
@_date: 2019-12-07 14:08:06
We will be good thanks for the concern. I have gold, guns, and a brain that functions without magical internet beans. What will happen to bitcoin users when an EMP shuts down the internet or power is out for weeks, months? Of course today no ones really uses bitcoin for anything or accepts it for a cup of coffee so it’s pretty much useless. Need info on that? Google Puerto Rico where people were without power for a year. ������������
@_date: 2019-12-06 18:33:08
So it’s been tampered with.
@_date: 2019-12-06 13:37:16
It will never reach that high again. It will go to zero.
