This is not the first drop i survived. The result of calm down and wait was that it raised a multiple higher than it dropped. All you need is just some patience.

yes thats a bit above +700% profit. That is what i'm doing. I spread coin to altcoins to lower the risk of total losses. day-trading is not my thing because it takes alot time which i dont have ;-)

I guess we are looking from the wrong perspective.
Fee's are inevitable. The more you pay the higher the prio, like its in reallife.
By them you support all the ppl that keep the bitcoin mill running.

This is how the party goes since i initially joined it at $1000 and still holding it.

That for sure, but not long term.
Its just an short term emotional reaction of traders and false evidence ;-)

I'm excited what will happen with Bitcoin Cash after Bitcoin Gold launch tomorrow. Dropping to the ground?

if price drop's like that, there might be a huge rebound which means up up up!
Smells like someone joined the Bitcoin Party is causing this temporarily.

nice joke!
