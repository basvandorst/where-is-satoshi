Great on accepting BTC, but why ONLY BTC? that just seems to cut out a huge chunk of the market. I'd just turn around and buy my pipes elsewhere, were I into that.

hmm. I like this idea. but there is going to be a delay of payment, so you could easily be out money, unless you could convince people to wait up to a month for their BTC. I'd also assume phone companies take a % of those transactions. so you'd have to be charging market plus fees for you and fees for the phone company. not ideal.
What about a game app that can have ingame purchases in $ and rewards paid out in BTC while  generating ad revenue? 
Almost any dumb little matching or blasting or racing game can have in game purchases, but is it possible to put out rewards as well? Have a little digging game and literally 'mine for bitcoins' (of course not preforming any algorithms). play for an hour and earn a few cents worth of BTC (if ad revenue at least triples or quadruples that). Drop down 99 cents and get an upgraded shovel. $4.99 unlocks the backhoe challenge. Things like that. People can withdraw when they get to .01 BTC.
Most people would spend more than they ever get in return, but if it was a good enough game then you could get millions turned on to BTC.
Who do we talk to to make this happen?

To repeat what's already been said, its the same as any currency. If you guys decided to accept Euros tomorrow and a customer buys an item and  returns it the next day and Euros have somehow doubled in value, that is not your fault as a company. it is a very simple line in a payment contract that says 'we accept bitcoins as payment at current USD value. Any returns, exchanges or discounts are offered in USD' . Bam, simple.

That cup of coffee you just HAD to drink in 2009? Its worth 8 billion dollars in bitcoin now. you could have bought Madagascar at midnight, but you just chose starbucks over being a king.

dude, it really takes away when you misspell 'genius'.

you certainly do.

I've been looking at bitcoins for a few weeks and this seems pretty freaking accurate. 
Scan my passport and birth certificate and email it to this Iranian based company? then do a money order transfer and wait a week to confirm funds? Sure, why not.

Alright, I guess I'm finally the one that doesn't get the joke. would appreciate an explanation or link.

I'm really happy to see that Smaller Business are adopting BTC. Have you had the chance to talk to other businesses about the advantages of accepting BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:27:14
plus it really rubs it into the banking system, so thats an added bonus.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:35:39
contact HostelWorld.com about that idea with some information. They accept many forms of payment that not every hostel they deal with accepts, for example I paid a deposit with my credit card and then my hostel only accepted cash. I'm pretty sure they can take 100% payments rather than just deposits. not losing 3%-5% in processing payments would be a huge advantage to them.

I'm going through the same thing. waiting for 1 week on a bank draft to clear. the price has gone from $604-over $1000. think my bank will make up the difference?

What about when these companies see that Gyft is increasing their gift card purchases? Wont they see a value to BTC and look at adopting it?

I wont be sinking 3500 euro into bitcoin. likely 2000, its what I can afford to lose. it may cost me some fun trips, but I know that I can easily survive on 1500.
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:52:35
fair enough.

The fun part is I'm a canadian on a working holiday in Ireland. I just moved into a house here and dont even have banking set up yet, trying to buy bitcoins/litecoins with my canadian accounts or cash/credit is a bit of a bitch. I've seen one person selling locally in localbitcoin, but he is valuing the bitcoin at more in Euros than it is worth in USD.

the point is to get people outside of btc to think of it as an obtainable currency rather than just as an investment that is outside the scope of them. unlike a stock, you can purchase as much or as little btc as you'd like as an investment or as buying power towards purchases. I think that the idea of putting it this way is to get the average person to understand that they don't have to put $1000 in. 
Talking about gold in grams also highlights that you can purchase smaller parts of it, but you also can't really spend gold in the same way you can spend bitcoins. You can buy $50 worth of gold, silver, cocaine, or BTC. its all in the amount that can be purchased with it compared to whatever currency your country uses. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 17:05:25
It's worth what people are willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:09:33
plus if you look on localbitcoin.com some people are trying to sell for even more than that. They understand that the average person wants bitcoin but can't get it, so they add a decent markup for themselves. 
want to see a thousand dollar bitcoin? localbitcoin.com search CANADA

While I agree with you that people will see value in BTC, I really hate the 'if we just get 1%' argument that a lot of new businesses throw around. Watch shows like Shark Tank and Dragons Den and see this argument get laughed out of the room. Of course **IF** big things happen then big things have happened, its more about the how. The how, in this case, is because BTC is quick, easy, finite, defined, and global.

if you were to play it on the radio (which seems like the only reason to need it audio-linked), you could just use the shazam app to link to a QR code.
If you're thinking of audio for another reason, fill us in.

The answer to this question is the same to the answer "Should I bet $400 on black?" You are taking a gamble, you are also taking a gamble if you invest in gold. Don't let the fact that $400 on black either = $800 or $0 dissuade you from your choice, any rise or drop will take time and you can pull out at almost any time as well. Most everyone in this thread will tell you that it's a good investment, others will say you're an idiot. only time will tell.
For reference, I first saw Bitcoins as an investment opportunity in January of this year. I did not invest. I'm changing my opinion on that, though I don't actively regret my choice.

hmm, damn.
I thought you could do full payments with them. Still, could be a great place to get using BTC

it seems like he brought 10k to an abandoned bridge, so there would be no transaction to verify. this is equally as likely to happen on Craigslist if a seller tries to get you to bring 10k cash for a car.

yeah, it will be after I take it out of the account.

9 years ago I got 6 out of 7 numbers on the lotto. 11 months ago, Bitcoins came on my radar and I found them interesting but didn't act upon it. 
6 out of 7 was $2800 instead of 15 million.
buying bitcoins now (first purchase just a few days ago!) is 50 times more expensive than it would have been in January. 
I didn't lose out on 15 million dollars and more than I lost out on bitcoin.
I don't feel that either one was a loss, both have been a gain so far. It's taking action that actually matters. Sure, I may not hit the 15 million dollar mark from bitcoin, and maybe the whole thing will go belly up. but I will be taking action on it, and hope for the best.
