More than likely true, but don't doubt the hackers out there who could actually pull this off. There are people out there who hack much more secure and larger networks just for the satisfaction of hacking it.

I have said for over a year, finex needed to go, and that they would be hacked. They had retarded broken code, no cold wallet integration. It was written on the wall for them. I'd like to see OKCoin be taken down the same way, with their cold wallet storage it just wouldn't happen. They would steal coins sure, but not to the tune of &gt;100k. No fuckin way.  Finex outsourced the wallet handling to a separate entity, through which they received a private API with authentication. So what does that mean? If you hack finex, you get their key and most likely the API auth code - your 2/3 multisig is fucking redundant. RIP finex, I won't miss you.

You are so blind to the warning flags. Finex has been riddled with them for over a year now. Fuck dude they GOT HACKED NOT TOO LONG AGO?!?!?!

PGP has been a regular on the Teamspeak for a LONG TIME, since 2014 when we originally set it up to allow more people to contribute to the chatter. It started on Google hangouts where only 8 people can participate, but it can be streamed out to the public.
He is not in work mode here, he is coming to relax and potentially try and offer some transparent insight. He has done this for a long ass time. No need to give him shit for this, I mean fuck, if your company had just lost 120k btc, would you not want a stiff ass drink? I wouldn't be coherent enough to sit myself at a PC.

He had to sell at a discount to ensure he would get out. You plonk a 30kbtc wall up during a rally and you can bet that will kill it. It's the biggest wall 99% of traders will see. 
Placing it at discount while price tried to rally elsewhere = guaranteed sale.

Considering the account that posted this is 3 years old, with only one page of posts and inactivity for a few years - I think it's legit...
- keep us updated, then close this account and move to a totally new online monika... Enjoy life if it's real. Good luck!

You're thinking bout this in the wrong way... 
2008 - Average internet speed (UK) -   3.6Mbps [ofcom]
2016 - Average internet speed (UK) - 14.9Mbps [ofcom]
2007/8 - World's first 1 and 1.5TB hard drive released.
June 2015    - World's first 10TB hard drive released.
Multiple TB Blockchain is fine, and as it continues to grow, it's fine. Technology will allow it to grow. In time, for instance, 20 years or so, there may be whole datacenters spanning the globe *purely* for storing the Blockchain.

Bought $180(day of bottom). $220 in Sept 2015(2nd bottom) and $420 before we launched to the 700s.
Still holding, no intention of selling. Buying £2k more over the next few months... We're still very underpriced imo and I think we have all the signs (not charts, but external signs from countries) that we may enter another exponential growth period pretty soon.

Had a bet with a friend on December 31st 2016 we'd hit 5k by December 31st 2017. Didn't expect it so early on tbh! he thought 2k, woops.

I would not have the money saved that I do now, had I not used my student loans (UK) to buy Bitcoin ('13, '14, '15).  Whilst everyone else was putting their loans up their nose &amp; pissing them away, I was buying Bitcoin, trading and living off the profit.  Now I'm in my final year, my friends have no money and I can afford to pay my full University fees off and that's after supporting myself through Uni with Bitcoin and not working. I'm not though. I'd rather hold em...

Hmm, I disagree. Even back in the alt bubble days of 2014, he's been an absolute fucktard.
Why does anyone even listen to him? Or give credit to what he says? Just ignore him, he's a tool.

Bitcoin may be down but so what. His ethereum profits are likely to be in the thousands of percent. This guy is a clever trader. Take heed new folks. No one ever went broke taking profits.
