Good thing the whole part is awfully highlighted, I wouldn't have any idea what to look at otherwise.

There's altcoins and then there's shitcoins

Knowing my post is the same way:
There's no point in your post if it's literally just "read the other post". It's already been said.

Right, every minute you don't remove your Bitcoin is another minute you're investing the full amount in Bitcoin - which is fine, if you choose to do so.

Why do so many people still look down to look at their phones? I see it all the damn time. Not sure why people don't just get a phone mount, at least that's in your peripheral vision.

Honest question, if you really believe that, wouldn't it be stupid to not put every extra penny into it? For every penny I don't put into bitcoin I'm suggesting I think whatever else I'm buying is worth more.
I would think if this is a true statement then the price would reflect it?

Enough money to pay someone else to find one for you

If you truly believe that wouldn't it be wise to take out the largest loan you can muster and invest it?

Obviously people aren't going to do that. We can at least make it 50% dangerous instead of 90%.

its ok, you can swear on the internet

Sure, traditionally and realistically you shouldn't. But it's hard to deny the plausibility of btc hitting $xx,xxx in which case the losses look like a joke compared to the potential earnings, right?
I considered getting a loan a while back for it and, while I understand it's not the "technically correct" method of investing, it still would have significantly changed my life had I done it.
It's hard to not feel like I'm still in that position right now, and will be again looking at past me like an idiot for not taking the risk. If it goes to the moon, I could retire early. If not, I just have to work a little harder to pay off a loan. Risk vs reward?
