Second email. Craig claims 




He is claiming that he is Satoshi, or at least the online persona. He said it himself in his "leaked" email.

I'm not saying Dave was the only person working on it; I just think he's the one who did the majority of the commits to Github and wrote the abstract for it. Personally, I think Craig was somehow involved, but is now attempting to take credit for more than what he contributed. We'll see though.

Why would you be confused if you were shown irrefutable proof in private? 


Doesn't seem as though the proof was 100%; almost as if he was given enough to satisfy him for at the time, on the idea that more info was going to be given out in the blog post. Now that that seems to no longer be the case, he's walking back on his blog post, which he says here was a mistake.

Maybe I'm not clarifying my point. My point is not that that proves anything, it's that it doesn't disprove him, or is evidence against him being Satoshi... I've yet to see anything Craig has written that includes a double space is my point. It's just one of the inconsistencies that's not there with Dave that is there with Craig.

Hadn't considered that. But why say: 


Why not just say, the proof was weird but that's not what he showed me? Or clarify that you still stand by that you think he's Satoshi.

Which thread? Are you talking about the abstract? [I'm talking about specifically the post from Dave.]( Obviously not the rest of the thread's discussion. My point is I find it unlikely that Craig was the one who [posted on the BCT Forum]( or that he was the one who made the White paper.

I'm since I don't have an interest one way or the other; I use bitcoin as a currency, nothing more. But something just hasn't sat right with me, and more questions have been raised than answered.
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:23:26
Right, which was done after a reddit thread here pointed out his inconsistencies on having never used it before.

From my perspective, it's more likely, at least to me, the real satoshi is/was Dave Kleiman, and now that he's dead Craig here is trying to spin a past relationship as though he was actually the one who did this.
This is all speculation, but Satoshi, or at least the one who wrote the White paper was Kleiman, and someone Craig became involved after the fact. With Kleiman dead and as such being unable to prove otherwise, Wright took the spotlight, and doctored history to make it appear he was Satoshi. 
In the initial leak to Gizmodo, I always found [this]( email (the first one) to be laughably bad; it reminds me of a South Park episode actually, where Cartman takes credit for the "fish dicks" joke. The ever present sociopath takes credit for something his partner did, to the point where he himself actually believes that to be the case. Personally, I think Craig was the "hacker" who sent the files to Gizmodo, partly doctored and partly not, to create the initial buzz to lead them to him, so he could pretend to begrudgingly admit to being Satoshi. 
In the Gizmodo article the timing of Klein's apparent hospitalization matches the final commit Satoshi made to Github:


Here's Satoshi's final commit to github: 
Personally, I have no idea how Craig is involved. But having seen his [writing style]( it doesn't seem to match. 
Compare that to Dave's
Note the Double Spaces after each sentence, the willingness to explain complex subject's simply, etc. It feels like I'm reading something written by the same person. 
Am I reading too much into this? Probably, but I find it hard to believe that Wright was the one responsible for the abstract. It's obvious he was involved somehow, but not to the extent he seems to be claiming.
EDIT: 
The plot thickens. Dave's father passed away at the end of March of this year 
The same father that asked about Dave's involvement in Bitcoin development, meaning he at least had an understanding that his son was working on it. 
As far as I can tell, the only other known relative of Dave is Ira Kleiman, who just happens to be an attorney. In the Gizmodo article, it's said that Dave carried a personal flash drive around where ever he went. Maybe that flash drive is now in the hands of his relative?
Kleiman dies, passes BTC through his will on to Father. [Father sees his son left him BTC in will, attempts to learn more and posts on this article asking for clarification]( Fast forward to now, Wright knowing about Kleiman and his father, sees his father might be falling ill, and starts this whole charade. Father dies, maybe without knowing the value of what his son left to him, and Wright makes his move now.
