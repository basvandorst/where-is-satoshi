Right. Not that bad. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 13:29:16
Because of greedy libertarian neckbeards fighting each other. 
What you see is what happens when ancaps try to run something without regulation. Take a good look and learn from it.

Did you know 99.9% of the businesses out there DO NOT accept Bitcoin. Which is completely normal. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 08:57:27
I love how pretty much every Bitcoiner is in it to get rich. If the price goes up 10 bucks this page is filled with moon posts. But mention the price going down and losses and the top comment is about how Bitcoin isn't about making money. 
And also hilarious how the thread itself is downvoted to oblivion.  
We're not allowed to discuss this. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 12:04:21
They have been for a long time already. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:14:30
Any day now. 
3 words i've seen posted at least 100 times over the past 1.5 years. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 08:50:55
You don't actually believe this yourself, right?
@_date: 2015-08-23 14:54:50
That's what money transmitters do. It's been discussed so many times already. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 14:22:29
Bitcoin's price has nothing to do with gold. Nothing. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 17:16:29
Sure. Go ahead. Or are you just an ideas guy?
@_date: 2015-08-23 10:21:33
Nonsense. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 03:15:02
If i would win the lottery tomorrow that would make me a millionaire. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 20:37:50
Yeah ok. Solid argument why this will also happen with Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-08-20 17:26:27
The same nonsense news as yesterday again on the mainpage? Really?
You people aren't exactly quick learners, are you?
@_date: 2015-08-22 22:28:55
Please stop posting this 1000 atm bs. It won't happen. We all know that. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:34:12
So which one of you is spreading this lie?


I wonder why i am being downvoted. It's ok to spread lies now? As long as it's good for Bitcoin right?
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:26:35
Maybe at one point after 6 years and 99.9999% of the world not wanting to touch Bitcoin with a 10ft pole (for often many good reasons) you have to start wondering which side are exactly the ignorant ones. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 21:06:32
I love how you're getting downvoted by frothing from the mouth Bitcoiners who are angry at you because it just HAS TO BE TRUE!! They won't accept anybody saying anything else. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:54:51
Yeah, just like the early email!
@_date: 2015-08-23 14:56:26
This time it's different!
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:11:56
My dollars are doing just fine. Thanks for asking. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:06:50
Guys, help me out. My grandma in Greece (with my help) followed your suggestion of putting her savings in Bitcoin. This was at $310. She almost lost 1/3 of her savings in 1 month. Can you help her out? 
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:54:38
If the Greeks would have bought coins during the Greece pump as you all suggested they would've lost like 30% of their savings. 
Please just stop with this nonsense. Again the Greeks won't buy coins. They just won't. For dozens of good reasons. Just stop. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:22:05
We're only 6 years in. Beta. Blah blah. By year 7 everyone will suddenly love it! 
@_date: 2015-08-21 03:14:04
How much did you lose so far?
Edit: i am not allowed to ask this without getting downvoted? Seriously? Is this place that desperate?
@_date: 2015-08-22 21:45:53
Their trapped what?
@_date: 2015-08-23 14:59:55
How stoned are you right now?
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:01:34
Based on him wanting to get rich. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 11:07:21
People leaving the sinking ship. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 10:43:03
I think i've seen the phrase there is blood in the streets followed by now is the time to buy about 50 times in the last 18 months or so. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:10:47
Bitcoin just dropped 60 dollars and shows no sign of stopping. 
"Hey guyz, you should really listen to me buy some coins!!" 
You people are hilarious. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 13:27:08
1 btc = 1 btc
Right guys?
@_date: 2015-08-20 22:01:45
What fee %?
@_date: 2015-08-20 19:49:20
I think we'll see about 10 of them. Of which 9 won't work after 3 months or are removed because nobody uses them. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 17:06:30
Of course. This time it's happening. The Greeks are gonna put their money in an unusable internet currency that just split in 2 and is facing a huge spam attack and lost about 80 dollars in value in a month. 
Sounds reasonable to you, i guess?
And right away downvoted of course. Because any sense of reality is not appreciated here. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 08:59:53
Because that would make your coins worth less. Am i right?
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:28:19
That comment made you go through his history?
Uh...scary. Kinda messed up and cultish behavior.
