Edit; While I'm considering getting one, I have no experience with them what so ever. There are a few bad stories floating around, but I cant seem to find any recent stuff on the subject.

The monsters disappeared because it would look 'cleaner'. 
I don't mind the pop down charts going either, never used them. 
I don't think it looks better though. It's just uglier as you say, and so alike that it's confusing.
I hope I'll be more excited once they finally introduce margin trading.

They can't spell on purpose.
If they spell correctly, a lot more people would respond, but won't fall for it in the end.
The people who do respond to these badly spelled emails, are usually more gullible, and are therefore more likely to fall for it.

The very first block created above the current limit would create a hard fork. There is no soft-ish fork.

Wouldn't say that, knowing most people still don't use multisig.
