And one more detail - Vodafone owns almost half of Safaricom, and engineered M-Pesa specifically to be operated by Safaricom.
I'm not sure I buy that there was government pressure to fight bitpesa. Safari / Vodafone simply have a very popular, unique (in the region) service, and they don't want to share their cake. Particularly, they don't want to share their cake with someone providing a parallel service directly on top of their cake like bitpesa is doing.

Bitfinex. BitGo was supposed to prevent things like, you know, thousands of transactions with very high value in a very short time span, like what you might see when a hacker is walking off with 75 million. It was also somewhat expected that their insurance would be at least partially helpful when bitfinex got robbed. It wasn't.
So, bitfinex is now back in business despite not even knowing how the hacker got in, and bitgo has formed a promising new partnership. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, well, just go ahead and fool me twice, apparently.

It doesn't say 'not very secure,' it says 'not always secure.' Those two claims are very different. You're right that they are simplifying events, of course, but it's hard to do otherwise in bite-sized news bulletins like that. 
Mainstream coverage is what it is. A huge theft is always going to be a better headline item than 'some dudes worked quietly for a while.' There hasn't been much going on recently that could be framed as a positive common interest story - 21.inc trying to sell free stuff is more funny than newsworthy, and nobody outside the crypto communities cares about the politics. One might tentatively hope that a resolution to the block size food fight could lead into some business developments, but until that time comes it's difficult to blame them (too much) for having nothing else to say about bitcoin than 'slow and not that interesting.'

The general reply in that thread is against Wright. In fact they answer the question with something along the lines of 'The person putting Craig Wright in a bad light is Craig Wright, and he's doing it by being a scamming windbag.'

Ummm, so colour me crazy, but don't you have an advisor or other qualified individuals at your place of education to talk to? Rule one of academic work, even at bachelor level, is **do** **not** **trust** **internet** **strangers**.
