The challenge is half in calculating fair market rate for burns and half, regrettably, politics: burning BTC *permanently* adds heft to the blockchain's UTXO set.
Users could burn coins in spite of this, but unlike with sidechains, burners wouldn't be able to exit their XCP position without a willing buyer, which almost defeats the purpose. Reinstating burns puts a cap on the price users are willing to pay for XCP, which could make it *more* likely for burners to take trading losses.
In the absence of deep liquidity pools and reliable price indices, a dynamically calculated burn rate would be subject to market manipulation games, and a price ceiling probably wouldn't help no matter how it was determined. And when you consider the toxic press from reinstating burns, the decision is not so simple.
With a stable and mature market, smart contracts and atomic swaps will make converting between BTC and XCP just as easy as doing the same with 2-way pegged side-coins. As with Bitcoin, the market depth and resulting stability of XCP will grow as more people are introduced to a [trustless Bitcoin stock market]( and smart contracts secured by Bitcoin mainnet.

Thank you for bringing up this point of contention. Bitcoin Core developers may hold lots of BTC, which is nice, but it isn't nearly enough to supercharge core development as many have attested to.
In addition, there's a night and day difference between holding a platform token balance, as in the Bitcoin core developers holding BTC, and *soliciting funds from the general public in a large scale IPO*.
point is the founders of Counterparty chose not to partake in the IPO launch strategy despite its controversial effectiveness in building developer wealth at the risk of the public. Everyone who burned bitcoins for XCP has the equivalent risk profile of the core developers, which is akin to how Satoshi launched Bitcoin.

Open Assets and other colored coin implementations have the same relationship with their respective forks.
It's hard to fork Bitcoin, or any blockchain technology, because it's impossible to fork venture capital. It's impossible to fork the many businesses built on top of Bitcoin worldwide. And it's impossible to fork Bitcoin's millions of active users.
There's also Bitcoin's community-driven documentation, the marketing and grassroots advertising, the meetups and conferences, and news coverage. Wouldn't you agree the same factors apply to all other blockchain technologies?

First of all, unimaginative ripoffs of Bitcoin aren't even worth talking about. They're a joke, and everyone knows it! Cheap clones of Bitcoin have nothing at all to do with why Blockstream is doing what it's doing.
If you have any reason to doubt this, just look at Mark Friedenbach, Jorge Timon and Luke Jr's public posting history. These guys may speak about kill all altcoins, but they have historically been most reactive to Counterparty and Ethereum. They react by accusing them of being parasites, pump and dump scams, and of jurisdiction hopping to avoid prosecution. Any time you see a substantial reaction like this you're looking at someone's bread and butter.
You all at Blockstream are being careful to tiptoe around the fact that you are primarily a Bitcoin 2.0 company whose main business model depends on you making a soft forking change to Bitcoin to enable it. You are rallying public support by claiming sidechains are needed for network scalability among other reasons which have nothing at all to do with why your company raised $15,000,000. Investors don't part with cash that easily. There has to be a compelling business model there, and everybody knows the name of the game is derivatives, securities, futures, options and smart contracts - in other words, Bitcoin 2.0.
They simultaneously denigrate their competitors who refuse to make such changes as "parasites" and "scammers" while trying to blanket label all altcoins as being nothing more than BBQcoin ripoffs. I'm looking forward to seeing a substantial debate you will have with your real competitors in the near future.

It's true. Anyone can fork Counterparty and track assets, but they would lose all the liquidity, all of the users, and all of the businesses built on top and the investors in those businesses.
Today Bitcoin is more liquid than its competitors, which makes it much more capable of seamlessly transferring value. Similarly, Counterparty's distributed exchange becomes more useful the more trading volume it has.
And what of the investors? Who would build the businesses on a fork? Would TechStars have invested in SWARM, the decentralized Kickstarter, if it weren't built on the upstream Counterparty? What about Overstock? Why would Patrick decide to close Medici off from the core platform powering the entire operation?
Would you enter into smart contracts on a fork of Counterparty with *yourself*?


Right, but who would you transfer your tokens *to*? Yourself? Because no one else would be using it.
Hashrate is only a point of differentiation among mined chains. Since Counterparty doesn't have miners, it would be pointless for end users to choose between Counterparty forks built on Bitcoin based on Bitcoin's hashrate. *They all have the exact same hashrate*. Choosing between Counterparty and Dogeparty is a different story.
In summary: you can fork the technology, **but you can't fork the users, businesses, investors or liquidity**.

Can you give me a single example of a business that would show a BTC profit over the period from late 2012 to late 2013?
- At $1/BTC, Satoshi Dice would need 1,000,000 gamblers to wager $10 each at a fee of 1% to break even: **total USD wagered must be &gt;= $10,000,000**
- At $10/BTC, Satoshi Dice would need 10,000,000 gamblers to wager $10 each at a fee of 1% to break even: **total USD wagered must be &gt;= $100,000,000**
- At $100/BTC, Satoshi Dice would need 100,000,000 gamblers to wager $10 each at a fee of 1% to break even: **total USD wagered must be &gt;= $1,000,000,000**
The price of Bitcoin matters. DUCY?
Also, if you were to loan 10 BTC to a friend in the one year period from late 2012 to late 2013, your friend would be getting a very raw deal. I wouldn't be so sure of his ability to pay you back. He would start by taking a $100 loan from you, at  the time thinking the only stipulation was to pay you back $110 in a year. A year later, and he ends up owing you **$6600**. Boy, I hope your friend's business got off the ground quickly. Otherwise he would had to have been living like a monk!

You only strictly need XCP to take advantage of advanced platform features, like [Intrade prediction markets]( and smart contracts.

Counterparty is riding on top of the network in a way that distributes proportionately more financial upside to holders of its native token than to holders of the token you have more of. Is that your theory? Mind you, you need a bitcoin wallet with &gt;0 balance just to use it. If Counterparty is successful with bitcoin as its fuel, the fuel is guaranteed to have a market. Whereas today's Bitcoin skeptic can point out that nobody spends Bitcoin on anything, a rise in Counterparty usage would signal loudly and clearly that BTC is a fuel for a decentralized Wall Street. Exchange cash for a stake in a company on your smartphone, and suddenly you aren't selling Bitcoin to people at all. You're just trying to match them with the right company, and "by the way a small number of Bits will be needed to fuel the transaction". This type of thing sidesteps most objections to Bitcoin in would-be investors. Like the Wolf of Wallstreet would say, you sell them Eastman Kodak first.
But you don't look at it that way. And I presume pitches related to Bitcoin 2.0 played an integral role in why Blockstream was able to raise $15,000,000. Their approach being, soft fork Bitcoin and experiment with a brand new security model 5 years into Bitcoin's existence. It is still unknown, for example, what the effects on concensus would be of a concerted attack on the main Bitcoin blockchain by a motivated adversary. You are fundamentally calling for Bitcoin 2.0 companies to abandon proven, simple and secure approaches and to trust instead in the security of your implementation.
Since 40% of Bitcoin core developers have equity in Blockstream and commit access to Bitcoin Core's official source code, I'm going to assume that sidechains are making it in regardless of how its security model stacks up to embedded consensus systems. Consider the fact that equity in Blockstream Co. ensures you will be on their side every step of the way. It's utterly astounding what a person can do when they have the tiniest financial stake in a company's success. It will cause you to turn a blind eye, when you see dollar signs, that combined with a good bit of confirmation bias will be absolutely blinding.
What you are against is seeing real companies like Overstock "disproportionately" help a different oligarchy. Even that is disputable, because anyone who values Counterparty must hold bitcoin. It requires BTC fees and a Bitcoin wallet to operate. It's increasing the demand for bitcoin.


Of course, the way to scalably make money in this space is by charging fees. Or is it? After all, no one has made more money than early Bitcoin investors, and if you can do that consistently you can certainly build a sizeable fortune for yourself. Satoshi is going to be the world's first trillionaire, and he's still anonymous. Don't you think Satoshi's lesson will fuel endless numbers of opportunistic developers who all want to try doing the same thing?

When trading BTC for altcoins, you need a trusted third party to carry out 2 of 3 multisig transactions. In 2 of 3 multisig, parties involved in settlement include you, your trading partner, and the escrow agent.
Conversely, with Counterparty, the protocol itself is the escrow agent. It's a decentralized settlement engine, the very first in the world.
Satoshi didn't add a settlement engine to Bitcoin. Which is where sidechains and Counterparty come in. Why do you think Blockstream is building sidechains? You can't do everything with pure BTC.
There is no perfect solution, but the advantage of Counterparty is it's directly on top of the Bitcoin blockchain which means it interops with normal Bitcoin wallets and inherits the security guarantee of Bitcoin itself in full.

One example of concern is Satoshi Dice. It was acquired in July 2013 for 100,000 BTC ($10,000,000).
Today, those same 100,000 BTC would be worth more than $50,000,000.
In light of this, the person who bought SDICE for 100,000 BTC in 2013 **lost over $40,000,000**. Ouch. Had he not taken any risk, he could've multiplied his starting capital by over 5X. *Doing nothing* would've yielded him a terrific ROI. This doesn't even factor in that the BTC price peaked at over $1200. By that metric, the buyer of SDICE lost over **$100,000,000**.
Having learned his lesson, why would the SDICE buyer ever invest BTC in hiring people for some other new business?
If you knew your 50 BTC today would be worth $5,000-$10,000 one year from today, are you telling me you'd spend all 50 BTC hiring people for some risky new business venture?

Anyone would regret investing 100,000 BTC in SDICE in 2013. Oh but that's easy for you to say in retrospect?

To this day, I've never seen a single person refute that Bitcoin's deflationary nature is troubling for investors, and in fact, big time VCs like Fred Wilson have specifically gone on the record to say that the deflationary nature of Bitcoin is the most troubling aspect of the system for them.
In an environment like Bitcoin's, doing nothing with your BTC has historically been vastly more profitable than investing your BTC.
If you'd feel bad about investing 100,000 BTC in SDICE, it follows that you'd also feel bad about investing 10 BTC to hire your neighbor to build you a website. Meaning, you would hire your neighbor less often. Meaning there would be less jobs.

The purchasing power of BTC is, rightfully, measured in USD. USD is the best objective measuring device we have of comparing purchasing power of BTC at different times.
The fact remains: you lent your friend $100 in purchasing power in late 2012, in the form of 10 BTC. 11 BTC in late 2012 was "worth" $110 in purchasing power at that time.
Fast forward one year, and your friend had to have come up with a means of turning $100 in purchasing power into $6600 of purchasing power. Yes, he owes you 11 BTC, but if he tried to buy that amount on the market in late 2013, it would cost him 60-120X what it cost *you* to lend it to him in the first place.


No, and I completely reject your premise. For Coinbase to have seen a real BTC profit from investing 1 BTC in late 2012, they would've had to have multiplied their money by &gt;60X. Are you telling me Coinbase would've been *worse off* by directly investing the $10M in VC money they raised in late 2012 into 1,000,000 BTC? Do you realize that if Coinbase had done that, their company would have **$660 million** in capital right now, at no risk to them?

Sidechains are based on the revolutionary concept of a two-way peg.
In a two-way peg, bitcoins are sent from your wallet to a special address. Some magic happens, and the BTC is placed in a state of suspended animation. Your money stays frozen but it's still yours.
Once the BTC is frozen, you would connect your Bitcoin wallet to a tertiary blockchain, called a sidechain. For example, you might connect your wallet to the Chicago Stealth Mercantile Exchange's service chain, because you want to engage in commodities trading on the blockchain while maintaining full control over your privacy and security.
Your wallet would, upon connecting to the CSME chain, automatically *redeem* your frozen BTC for "BTC-CSME", giving you a balance on CSME almost immediately. And magically, once you're finished trading on the CSME, or if you are unsatisified with the CSME service chain in any way, you would convert your BTC-CSME back into regular BTC by reanimating it on the main Bitcoin blockchain.
The theoretical benefits include:
1. Since there's no altcoin involved, you don't have to worry about exchange rates and pump and dumps just to trade commodities on the blockchain.
2. Since sidechains have far greater maneuverability than the main Bitcoin blockchain, you can do more on them. Speed up the chain so that trades execute in a snap. Add Zerocash for an uncompromising degree of privacy. **Add commodities trading natively to the blockchain.**
Emphasis added because this is where Counterparty comes in.
You simply can't do commodities trading with BTC directly. Satoshi didn't add a commodities trading engine to Bitcoin.
Importantly, if you want to do that type of trading **on Bitcoin, directly**, you have to protocolize the trading engine inside of the data packets being sent back and forth across the blockchain as miners validate transactions. Some call it analogous to riding on top of Bitcoin, which is controversial because the Bitcoin network has limited resources, and ultimately the embedded commodities trading engine competes against YOU in the transaction fee market, potentially driving fees up and taxing network resources above and beyond what would occur if the only thing that ever happened on the Bitcoin blockchain was morally approved international remittance payments.
Now, back to sidechains. In a two-way peg, you can move your BTC into BTC-CSME and back out again, and you can get the type of trading engine Counterparty provides. But since you aren't sending Bitcoin transactions on the main blockchain, you aren't getting the full security of the main blockchain. No one knows how to ensure security on sidechains because it's never been done. In addition, sidechains make for a very attractive hacking target. Not only can you attack sidechains anonymously without going through Tor, there's nowhere for the sidechain to hide. A successful attacker gets to steal the full reserve of BTC attached to the sidechain if the security model fails.
There's one more advantage to Counterparty: the simplicity. When you use the Bitcoin network purely for passing around data, you don't have to worry about it. Just code up an app, and connect its backend logic to the Bitcoin network. Everything's done for you, and you have nothing to worry about so long as Bitcoin stays neutral. You also get the full security guarantee of Bitcoin itself, without rolling your own crypto. Depending on what your app's goals are, this style of development can be far safer and easier not to mention light-years faster than coding Bitcoin Core from scratch in C++, and arranging for your new chain to be mined by a majority of Bitcoin's hashing power, which is the minimum amount of security you would want for the CME.
Counterparty matches orders on the blockchain. But in order for their Python app to move user balances around pending matched orders, they need to give you a distributed ledger balance. A new distributed ledger means a new cryptocurrency. But since Counterparty's trade engine works inside of Bitcoin transactions, the creators figured the best way to initialize their app's distributed ledger was for Bitcoin users to "burn" BTC by sending it to a provably unspendable location on the blockchain. Any BTC sent to that unspendable address would be rendered permanently inaccessible. The Counterparty app only needs to scan this address and credit every sender with an initial balance.
This is fundamentally different than the sidechains approach, where your funds are placed in a state of suspended animation but can be later redeemed.
**Advantages of Sidechains**
- Allows your current BTC balance to do more for you
- No more worrying about altcoins or pump and dumps
- CSME may be able to implement "HFT" block times on their sidechain
**Disadvantages of Sidechains**
- New and untested
**Advantages of Counterparty**
- Highly safe protocol development style that is generally more accessible and easier for devs to work with than groundbreaking C++, as evidenced by Counterparty beating Blockstream, Ethereum and others in a race to launch
- Trustless private stock exchange built on the Bitcoin blockchain, with dividends payable in BTC directly to cold storage Bitcoin wallets like Armory
**Disadvantages of Counterparty**
- You need a separate ledger balance on Counterparty if you want advanced functionality, e.g. Intrade prediction markets. Most stock traders won't need a XCP balance and will instead just trade previously created company shares, paying BTC fees to send the transaction through the Bitcoin blockchain.
- Since the Bitcoin blockchain is relatively slow to confirm transactions, trades currently execute at a snail's pace. However this tradeoff is worth considering since the upside is receiving OSTOCK BTC dividends directly to a paper wallet in cold storage.
One last advantage of Counterparty is that, since it doesn't strictly care *which* blockchain its data gets passed through, it can connect to the Namecoin blockchain or the Doge chain, or even a sidechain just as easily if any one of those proves to be faster and more secure than the main Bitcoin blockchain. Because of this unique property, a ledger balance on Counterparty is a guarantee that you will retain the ability to trade on a stock market, via whichever decentralized platform ends up being the fastest and most secure.

The author assumes weakly defended sidechains could be a legitimate alternative to storing bitcoins with Circle and Coinbase.
What the author has missed is when miners 51% attack the main Bitcoin blockchain, they cannot steal BTC. But on sidechains, 51% attackers can in fact [steal BTC]( out of the sidechain's reserves. This is an extreme departure from what people are used to seeing with Bitcoin. Specifically, a sidechain would become fractional reserve after a successful attack.


1.5 BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain is worth at least as much as 1.5 BTC on a sidechain, for reasons explained above. Since sidechain BTC could deteriorate in value or disappear entirely following a successful attack, on the open market, we could only expect Bits to trade at a premium compared to sidebits. Hence, bits and sidebits would need separate currency symbols on Bitstamp. Sidebits could be comparable to Bits, but comparable doesn't mean equivalent.
In addition, you cannot send sidebits directly to a Bitcoin address, but you can always send BTC to a sidechain. Hence, BTC will always be the more versatile and liquid instrument. Any time you diverge from the main chain you will be dealing in a different currency.

Counterparty is a Bitcoin based platform and doesn't require its own currency. Counterparty the platform clearly isn't an altcoin.
However, you may want to acquire XCPs to take advantage of optional advanced functionality on the platform. Since XCP's price floats freely against BTC, most people are going to consider XCP an altcoin.

Economic analysis is a pseudo-science.
Imagine you bought SatoshiDice for ฿126,315 BTC in July 2013 ($12,400,000). Don't laugh. Someone really did this.
If that person was YOU, and YOU had NOT spent your 126,315 BTC on SatoshiDice, and you had instead done absolutely **nothing**, and taken zero risk, you would've made about $100,000,000. Instead, the decision to buy out SatoshiDice costed you $100,000,000.
In a deflationary economy, the opportunity costs of spending capital go up **substantially**. This may not matter for consumers buying bedsheets on Overstock, but it absolutely does matter for investors.

I'm already convinced consumers are better off in a deflationary environment. But I won't sit here and pretend it's all rainbows and sunshine.
Investors are worse off because deflation punishes risk taking. Not that society needs any more windfall profits for investors.
If Bitcoin takes off it will have far reaching implications on how society allocates capital.

Tether has the same problem as BTC with getting merchants and consumers to adopt it. What reason does the average person have to adopt blockchain USD? Why would a merchant accept it as payment?
The PayPal-like model of Coinbase or Circle makes more sense to me. It enables consumers to settle payments in USD with instant conversion of USD to BTC and back to USD, and it's a lot less complicated to use than Tether. What's something new and different that Tether can offer? Privacy? Freedom? They're a regulated financial institution.
