From February till July (i was lucky that I bought eth in December 2016 so trading for me was like playing a game with fake money..). All my trades followed the exact same rules with one thing in my mind we are in an extreme bull market. So I'd wait for a flash crash of 7 or more % and wait for the panic to stop (you get a feeling for it) then I'd buy the bottom and immediately sell the first rebound (sometimes it crashes further after it and sometimes it goes through the roof..but i didn't care for those missed gains..just for my successful trades).. no stop losses used..this strategy does not work in a bear market because it can always dip even further after a supposed "bottom" (can happen in a bull market as well but the general sentiment is way different and you know it's going up anyways)

I had 102 consecutive successful trades last year (from 2% to 25% per trade)
Not a millionaire because i never put more then 2k per trade...but in a bull run you can't really lose money

Yea because it's like 50/50 for me in a bear market lol... that's why i don't trade and wait for the next bull run... don't have to be greedy just patient :)

You never have to buy a whole Bitcoin..so it's never too late..but i guess you mean too late for gaining money with it..

If you buy btc and spend them it's the same as buying euros and spending them..if you sell back for dollars that's something different..and applies to other currencies as well

Your interest is way too high...go and negotiate another one.. you live in Germany it's gonna be similar to Austria...take another loan to pay your debt but with an interest of max 3%...we have extremely low interest rates right now... take advantage of that...
