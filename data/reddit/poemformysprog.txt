You got one that’s about to go down a drop?

Or...not. Newspapers/websites don't just pull stories out of their asses - they get them from sources like the associated press (websites with the specific purpose of providing news stories to news sources).

I don’t think it matters that people are dropping fat stacks in strip clubs. Most people with a lot of money are paying digitally anyway, so that has nothing to do with it. 
As a store of value, Bitcoin has the potential to be better, but as it stands it’s far too unstable and inherently useless. As a currency, it can’t be widely spent, value is fluctuating widely (so your stored value could be worth a quarter of your investment within a few months). Gold has an actual inherent usefulness outside of being a store of value, which makes it far more useful than bitcoin is right now. Bitcoin also has its scalability issues that are preventing it from becoming useful as a currency.
When it comes down to it, Bitcoin is relying on its popularity and scarcity alone. What is to say another coin won’t win out within a few years, making your investment nearly worthless? That’s far less likely with gold

On what planet is the progress steady and strong? There was a jump and it hasn’t moved in a couple of days, with a decent chance of it plummeting yet lower like it has in many cases over the past year

I think it’s probably a matter of time before something better comes along that’s easier to purchase and use, and bitcoin will slowly die.  We can all acknowledge that Bitcoin has its problems, so it’s easy enough for a coin with better scaleability to come along and become more popular, get more adoption and make bitcoin seem way inferior as a currency. I think it could hit 100k, but I don’t think it will last

Except that timeframe certainly isn't the only factor - the fluctuations are far more wild (e.g. ~19k down to ~3k in a year). Also, the fluctuations within a short space of time are important when Bitcoin's value is as a currency, and its price is clearly influenced by bad/good press about its usefulness as a currency.


If you're admitting the possibility of this, then you're admitting that your bitcoin could well be worthless in a few years. I do agree that it's great 'on paper', but when there's a big question mark over its usability as a currency on a large scale, and its value can plummet dramatically because someone says something bad about it in the press, then it's a pretty risky store of value. 
I do want Bitcoin to succeed, and would like to believe in it unconditionally, but would I use Bitcoin as a store of value if I had millions on my hands? Probably not

Are you saying that something has failed if it doesn’t last forever? I’ve got news for you: Bitcoin will not last forever if it does become a viable currency. That’s how the world works - newer technology makes the previous obsolete. It doesn’t mean the failure of crypto, it means it’s able to adapt to change

Are you broken?
