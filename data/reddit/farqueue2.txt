I think I would have hired lawyers.
You're a complete fuckwit if you think that can be categorised as self defence
@_date: 2019-07-03 04:07:49
because in 20 years there'll be no ways to mitigate against any of this risk? I can sweep my wallet  to a new wallet right now and all inherent risk from past instances of reusing addresses is immediately null and void.
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:44:38
Because Quantum computers grow on trees...
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:39:46
Which is pretty much exactly what I predicted
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:28:50
Is there any official word from ledger on this? Otherwise I'm inclined to see it as a bug of sorts and I wouldn't wanna put a lot of funds in something that ledger might "fix" one day and hence invalidating the wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:38:32
you were saying?

But remember. He's a self made millionaire ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

or he can just look back with self satisfaction and not be a complete asshole to someone that is struggling in life, albeit that has made bad decisions and still has questionable morals? 
@_date: 2018-09-28 09:07:37
For all you know he already has
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:51:30
It's not only those two options. I would steer clear of bcash though
@_date: 2018-05-29 04:42:51
and look at the page they link. 
it's made to look very official, with this twitter account that's essentially shilling Shitcoin Cash as the real bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:46:12
That's WHY we want to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-12 11:41:27
Whenever I see this kind of stuff I feel inclined to post the following:
Roger Ver is a dickhead.
@_date: 2018-05-03 04:17:57
Oh wait, they said December 2017, not December 2018... My bad.
@_date: 2019-03-01 09:41:06
To be fair, if you had $1400 in Bitcoin in 5 years ago and you forgot you had it, that is now worth shitloads and it's gone.
@_date: 2019-03-09 00:04:38
Well "Bitcoin wallet with KYC" is a bit of a misnomer.
Anybody can have a Bitcoin wallet for free without KYC. The KYC part is only on exchanges and that is more about the fiat part.
@_date: 2019-11-13 14:15:56
Be ready for the possibility of your investment being worth 30% of what it is now and then 300% not long after.
@_date: 2019-11-21 01:32:06
It's all about the Margin between rates on deposit and credit. As the cash rate gets lower and lower, the room for banks to move while keeping deposit rates positive shrinks. It eats directly into their bottom dollar
@_date: 2019-11-13 22:26:44
The 300% relates to the now price not the dropped price
@_date: 2019-03-02 18:32:54
Markets are markets. Even when the product is the same, market restrictions and forces can see prices vary from market to market.
Same thing happens with fiat, shares, gold, etc.
This is called trade arbitrage and people can often expose this for profit
@_date: 2019-11-22 09:56:18
Except banks became a thing because cash was inconvenient and unsafe to handle in large amounts.
It was only 20-30 years ago when there were still a lot of people that would either be paid in cash or would keep all of their savings underneath their bed and not in a bank.
Not to mention the fact that Bitcoin is the first truely borderless currency that can't be printed  (and therefore manipulated) at the whim of a central bank/government
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:08:01
Market manipulation is 1 thing.. printing copious amounts of currency to bring down the value is another.

Bitcoin is stable. It's fiat that fluctuates around Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-27 09:51:46
@_date: 2019-08-03 09:24:41
That's how much this has to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-19 23:18:52
Probably the same reason it has a bitcoin sticker..

@_date: 2019-06-21 06:05:22
lol yeah. the circle jerkness here is a bit much sometimes. 
Even if we pass $10k and ultimately reach a new ATH by the end of the year, there's every chance we'll dip below $10k again before that happens.

The bch shills don't want the people to choose.

drinking too much water can literally kill you. 
So don't drink any at all.

So if someone gets their hand on it, without the seed code... You're still relatively safe?
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:12:48
To be honest, I'm suspicious of anyone that knows the slightest thing about bitcoin that calls this anything other than a coordinated attack. you're either in on it, or you're a moron. (or both). 
@_date: 2019-12-23 12:02:48
Can't snort coke through a rolled up Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:17:37
So I bought one the other day and am waiting for it.
I'm curious. Do you carry it with you at all times?
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:10:12
Pretty much. This dickhead didn't just attack Bitcoin. He attacked the livelihoods and finances of many people.
Look how much money has been poured into Bitcoin and other crypto since the BCH fork. He basically attacked all of those people.
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:32:19
Great, no more shitcoin ads
@_date: 2018-03-17 05:37:59
They are very thorough.
Most people don't even realise that terrorism works to the US government agenda.
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:59:03
Because it's a piece of shit
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:56:14
That's only technically correct.
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:55:00
Especially when the horrible gif conversion that Reddit does makes it basically unshareable
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:58:56
It really isn't that hard to understand
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:09:07
This makes me concerned that Bitcoin may in fact be fraud.
After all, nobody knows fraud better than a fraudster
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:34:37
I missed a key word
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:28:31
I didn't say it's not complex. But you said that you don't know a single person that understands it.
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:10:25
the android APK on the website should be fine yeah? 
@_date: 2017-09-06 10:26:50
so what's the chance that electron cash has malware? wouldn't we know by now, given that it's source code is available? 
@_date: 2017-09-06 10:28:01
yeah i was following that guide some time ago and was getting nowhere...
doesn't matter now anyway i did it in electron cash and transferred to coinomi
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:29:15
i dunno... i guilded someone on reddit a while back and paid for it with bitcoin. 
i liked his comment, but FFS it wasn't worth AUD$40 to me. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:51:37
I also found it to be a valuable read
@_date: 2017-09-06 08:58:45
It's electron cash available on Android?
@_date: 2017-09-17 09:23:56
Well they can valuate trades made that involve USD
If you buy a coin at $4000, and then sell it a year later at $5000, then clearly the value of that coin has made you $1000 profit, which they'll want a piece of
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:31:40
Ok I got it sorted, and paid out to my coinomi wallet. Thanks.
Now 1 question:


Can you explain what the rush would be? If I uninstall that electron cash app is there any risk to my mycelium btc wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:43:44
Wtf is with all these posts
Did you all go to the same dress up party?
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:09:12
You really think EFTPOS machines are that expensive?
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:30:01
A hardware wallet when he's only investing €500?
What's the point of spending 5-10% of his potential holding on a wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:01:00
Most accounts nowadays are fee free, at least in Australia. You just get stung the eft fees
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:57:14
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:26:07
Then use a good software wallet and backup private keys
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:41:30
Way over my head. lol

For this to happen in Australia, every country in the world, and some planets as well, would need to set the example.

It's not just targeting crime, it's also primarily targeting the cash economy. People that provides goods or services for cash and not declaring and paying GST. They want more of an audit trail.
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:03:21
Exactly 
I wonder how much he was paid to make this post
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:40:19
You got that too?
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:33:07
Is there a bigger dickhead in the crypto world than Roger Ver?
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:58:58
This is brilliant.
Do the charts update?
And how do we get vertcoin listed ;)
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:57:19
It would be good if you can introduce some sort of time x axis, which would probably much make the game educational.

Permission requests are grouped together on a number of categories, otherwise you'd be getting 200 requests for permission for each app you install
