Your quiz is bad, and you should feel bad.
Question 1 has no correct answer, question two has bad grammer, question 3 has nothing to do with Bitcoin, so I stopped there.

I wasn't required to give an argument. I'm just pointing out your grammer hypocrisy.
And wow, lots of venom. How do you even know I'm part of anything?

&amp;gt; BITCOIN's
I'm not a native English speaker but isn't the plural "s" written without apostrophe? Is it possible that Steve from the PayPal compliance department has some serious grammer problems?

Wow, embarrassingly bad punctuation and grammer (and customer service) for a business. I wouldn't do business with them based on this...

I think I messed up some grammer in the title. As long as you pay 6$ or more you get all the games, if you pay less than 6$ you only get the games in the upper row.

You have still failed to point out any spelling mistakes, but if you do manage to find any, and the 'poor grammer', please do contact the team via support
Thank you.

&amp;gt; If the computers in the Bitcoin network endorsed an illegitimate creation of new money, it would be akin to a majority of grammer teachers suddenly agreeing that "ain't" is acceptable usage.
Nice comparison, I'll remember that.

And with a brainwallet based on a long nonsense poem with bad grammer and bad spelling that you made up, nobody can prove you own any bitcoins in the first place, and it's perfectly secure.

Let's report inaccurate facts because if we get too detailed we may report inaccurate facts.  That's as bright as your grammer.

Also, there are some common small grammer errors, like saying "If any of your accounts have" instead of "If any of your accounts *has*".
