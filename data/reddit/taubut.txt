I wish you good luck in waiting for the crash. Time will tell who is right here.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:49:16
Nope, sorry. I thought you were being serious.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:43:27
I'm in. What should I name my coin? Bitcoin Doge?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:45:24
Or just use Litecoin for quick transactions, and Bitcoin for holding.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:39:11
Easily $20,000 by the end of this weekend. We will never see sub $10,000 again. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:49:50
Never going to happen. This is too far gone up now. You'll be waiting a lifetime for that if you're waiting to buy in then. There is massive FOMO right now. I have friends who I spoke to about bitcoin 5 years ago asking to get in now, and then I also have their mothers asking to get in. The FOMO is nuts. Years ago news about steam removing bitcoin would have been enough to crash the market, but last night it didn't even blink.

You sound like a dick. I'm sure you're mad, but you also sound so unprofessional its crazy

It works the same if you were to lose cash, or gold. You drop $1,000 on the ground walking in the city and you aren't going to get that back. You can't just go somewhere and they will replace your cash for you. It's the same way with bitcoin. Think of you losing your coin as dropping it on the ground. You lose it, that's it unless the other person for some reason returns it. This is why if you aren't using cold storage for large amounts of coin it is a very big risk. Also if you are using an online wallet of any kind make sure you have 2FA set up.
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:47:23
Do you have anywhere showing that they are using bitpay? I would guess they are using coinbase just like overstock.com is doing.
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:11:38
Hi, I know this is from 13 days ago but maybe if you have some time you could walk me through removing the fairplay encryption?
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:46:30
They are most likely immediately liquidating them through coinbase just like overstock.com is doing. They are just using this as another form of payment, but it still helps the bitcoin economy. This way it just helps prevent them from having to worry about the bitcoin price changes.
Also just like overstock.com you can only get a gift card in return for your purchase if you request a refund.

I want it if you could please give me an IPA link.
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:07:20
Looks cool! price seems to be off by about $100 for some reason but either way its still a fun pay to pass the time!
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:34:03
I actually looked at doing the same!
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:49:47
Do you think it would be a good idea to remove all my coins from coinbase, wait for the fork so I can get the BU coins and sell them right away, and then move them back?
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:09:33
And how would one go about getting their coins on the other chain? I'm guessing if I have my coins on something like Coinbase I probably just won't ever have access to them?
@_date: 2019-03-02 15:14:57
So I tried that multiple times last night and nothing was showing up. It finally showed up this morning after going into the reorder wallets screen and then going back and pulling to refresh.

See you all at the bottom!!!
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:12:00
I only have 3, so I think your 500 is a lot. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:47:28
A few hours? Try in a few minutes.
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:14:40
Nudes? Might want to check your auto correct. :)
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:27:53
Well I'm pretty sure we were all expecting it to tank in 2 seconds. Sadly none of us were even able to log in to attempt to sell before it hit $3.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:29:56
I signed up for Gemini last week. Was verified next day.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:28:44
So far I've made about $4 overall cause I can't time anything right this morning hahaha. But I'll take that $4! 
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:33:56
Bitconnect has been around for over a year. Why are you being so defensive if you wanted opinions? Sounds to me like you've already made your decision. It's your money, do whatever you want with it.
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:33:08
Fairly sure Coinbase / GDAX has always been 6, or at least been 6 for a while now.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:52:35
I wrote that comment at 3940ish on GDAX, but yup hahaha I lost that bet there. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:39:38
I say it stays above 3900. I don't think we will ever see under $3,000 again.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:30:41
I honestly think this is a small dip, probably not the big correction everybody is waiting for. It is a good time to make some money though!
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:16:33
All $500 into BTC and just let it ride. Don't try and buy and sell, just buy $500 worth of BTC and let it ride the waves.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:25:54
Looks like we might be going back up. That was a fun ride. Lets go again!
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:54:33
And I sat here buying and selling the whole way up. The pump last night into this morning was amazing.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:54:47
Yesterday was such a rush haha. I don't want to remember $3600. :p
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:20:24
Few weeks? Try a few days.
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:14:50
Yeah I don't think I'll be ever using Bitsquare. Just took a look at their website and their screenshots look like they ripped off Kraken and are claiming it as their own. They do not look like something I'd ever trust with my coins.
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:39:00
Hope people are making some good money off this!!
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:01:46
I probably should do that like right now! Thanks for the help again!
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:33:52
iPhone XS
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:52:27
Working just fine. Next time try  before sounding like the worlds ending.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:31:17
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:39:55
I've held through every decline. Never been scared.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:06:18
Not gonna drop till January if it does drop at all. I'm betting it never drops under $10,000 for any significant amount of time again. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:54:06
Been using Coinbase since 2013. No issues. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:56:42
Thank you! You're a god. I was able to get by the boot loop!! Now to save my private key hahahaha.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:07:27
I agree, I see it easily hitting $30,000. I don't think we will ever see sub $10,000 again.
@_date: 2017-04-26 18:16:25
I sure hope so. I've been sitting on 3 coins since it was $100. Should have had 5 but I pulled some out at one point. Since then I've learned to just let it ride. I try to forget about it for a while then check it and be surprised. Up or down I don't care. Just ride the bitcoin rollercoaster.
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:36:21
Why not Shift? I know it connects with Coinbase, but for people new to bitcoin Coinbase is very simple for them to use, and setting up a shift card with that account is extremely simple also.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:36:21
You know it!
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:22:28
Actually BCC hit 1,000 way later than the day it started. When it started it maxed out around like $700 or so. The $1,000 didn’t happen for a while. Although it instantly dropped back down after.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:29:24
I need bamboozle insurance. Are you selling?
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:52:32
Annnndddddd that's a coin in...3...2...1...
@_date: 2017-10-08 11:08:44
The running a full node looks like you centered the text by aligning it to the center, but really you may want to think about visually centering it instead. The “A” looks a bit off and not actually centered so this is where visually centering is most likely better then using the tool.
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:56:40
Bitcoin Cash Coin? Is that like ATM machine?
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:17:43
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:45:56
What I want to know is how whatever machine you're using is so badly insecure that you created a Coinbase account and was hacked the exact same day.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:45:44
You were trying to buy at 3000 and it took till 6000 for your paycheck to go through?
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:12:27
Normally an Apple guy, but seeing this makes me now want to buy a surface instead.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:19:42
Besides the price possibly tanking is there any risk in not getting my BCC right away ok august 1st? Can that wait a few days?
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:13:09
I'm just worried about the whole making sure I don't lose my BTC in the process, or where to store them until then. Are there any safe suggested iPhone wallets I can use that will allow me to get both my BTC and BCC?
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:18:46
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:57:32
I'm betting on most likely down forever and everybody loses everything they had there.
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:55:20
How are you so sure?
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:22:51
Bitcoin Price at $100 is in sight: Taubut
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:19:26
I wouldn't exactly call 100USD a "crash"
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:43:21
3 years ago somebody told me to invest $100 a month into bitcoins. That was the best thing anybody has ever told me to do. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:40:58

@_date: 2013-11-27 18:49:01
So much panic! This is funny to see everybody piss away all their bitcoins. I'm riding it all the way down and buying more cause people see one sell and everybody loses their minds.
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:59:24
Technically you can sell right away, but you will not get the cash for around a week. Meaning if it goes right back up and you want to buy back in you are spending extra money from your bank account, not the money you just got from selling the BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:07:27
Coinbase is now over $250. Although I'm still not sure I trust their prices either. Bitstamp IMO is the best to watch.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:31:20
I am very interested in this. Could you please send an invite?
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:09:01
Got it! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:23:45
I live in Dorchester just past the Braintree mall. I was looking to get a new Mazda this year but since you now accept Bitcoin this may have changed my mind!
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:05:03
One big holder sold and everybody panic sold. Price will plummet probably to 400 or lower is my guess. Sell now, and be ready to buy back very soon!
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:03:23
Could you please explain the significance of uBTC instead of just buying full BTC if I have the ability to?
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:04:30
Thats correct. I've seen some posts from people saying that coinbase will reject your sell or buy if it goes up or down to much saying that its "high risk" when really its just them trying to make sure they get a profit, but I haven't had a problem with it yet. If you contact coinbase and get your account white listed from being a spam account that should not happen.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:25:56
Just a dumb question, but if the USD is considered "dead" and the government collapses, as many of you seem to wish will happen. Wouldn't that hinder the ability of bitcoin? If the USA collapses and the internet goes away here it will likely effect other countries as well. If that happens there is the chance of bitcoins also being considered "dead" and people would have to fall back on gold standard or something else.
The way I see it is we should already have stopped associating the USD with bitcoin. Let bitcoin be its own thing and let the dollar be its own thing. No reason to sit here and hope that the USD dies off and the USA collapses just because you want bitcoin to rise up.

Claimed one! Thanks!!
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:21:08
I've only been in bitcoin for a a little bit myself, but my guess is it would go down a little because some people may cash out a bit to buy holiday gifts. Although a drop may not happen at all because it would probably be spread over lots of days considering I don't think every single bitcoin holder is targeting one single day to cash out and buy gifts. So unless somebody big cashes out I think we will probably hold steady in the 6-700's maybe 800's.
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:48:40
Yup. I have one too :)
