People who would like to assert that Circle is "evil" or that they want to take your money do not understand how economic regulations work. Companies like Circle must adhere, as best as they can, to standard business practices that track every transaction.
The more companies that begin to "centralize" their flow of Bitcoin are the companies that won't be audited and shut down. 
I am all for anonymity, and decentralization, but for Bitcoin to gain a critical mass it must pass a series of checks and balances or the IRS is likely to get riled up.
Until I here that someone has lost money/BTC due to Circle I am waiting to reserve judgement. In fact, one of my friends just bought some and it seemed to operate even more smoothly than Coinbase.

Circle is worth checking out. Start an account if you already haven't. It is not free (although their no fee claim is misleading), and they do allow you to send your BTC to your offline wallets. Both seem to be worth using, see for yourself.
