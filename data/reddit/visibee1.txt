Yeah, basically intercept the client side transaction generation and replace the send/change address or both with their own, the server has no way of knowing if this is valid or not and will sign off, same with any Bitcoin wallet and after multi sign becomes ubiquitous, I think will become the number one hack

Not true, you will always want to hide some things from some people and not from others. For example, I produce a chemical product which i sell to company a, company b would love to know how much i charge to company a but i don't want them to know. The industry regulators want to see all my transactions for national security purposes. Bitcoin can deliver in this scenario way more effectively than any native  currency via BIP32 address systems. I can transact in private on the blockchain and provide my master public key to any authority that wants to audit me. That is amazing.

a little pet peeve of mine...
A lot of these sites, coinbase, blockchain.info I have no doubt they have 1.6 - 2m entries in their database, but I would much rather see active user numbers, and by active I mean used in the last month.
What has happened with most sites is that there is a core userbase of (in my estimate) 200-300k active users of Bitcoin, during the bubble and media hype, traffic went through the roof. Mainly people visiting the site, creating an account and then never coming back. Sure, some stuck around, including me, maybe a healthy 5-10%- which is good!
Particularly the companies who had money to spend on google ads at the time and were also high in the search results, will have increased the entries in their databases by a lot.
See the coinbase graph below:

Of course they will, tumblers for example, do you think I want any of my transactions to be tumbled? You would have to be insane. My transaction to pay my plumber is tumbled with a transaction of someone buying an illegal product? The authorities would have to investigate any address on the outputs of the transaction, the FBI knocking on my door? no thanks

My personal belief is that this is most amazing technology i have ever seen. If it can navigate the challenges of regulation and attack by various institutions it could become at least the defacto global transmission of value protocol. My feeling is that Bitcoin (separate from crypto currency in general) i.e. the name "Bitcoin" is too politically aggressive and may shoot itself in the foot due to the more politically motivated people in the community pushing their own agenda rather than the economic and market efficiency benefits of Bitcoin

It sounds like just using the protocol as a tech system, if they have control of the money supply and value pegged to gold, then it is nothing new, just a different implementation of central banking with a crypto- settlement system. They would control the transaction charges in terms of moving coins from the side chain to the main chain and the supply of coins. So same deal. Decentralization is what is important.

Can you elaborate on "if there servers get hacked you can be tricked into sending too much money" is this via the server returning incorrect values on unspent outputs? If the JavaScript is generating the transaction locally (and was delivered from signed dist mechanism) isn't the server limited to providing the list of unspent outputs. If these are manipulated is the damage limited to adding a larger than normal miner fee? Or am I missing something?

some of the tipping has been good, like the guy who got money for his kid etc. But a lot of it really looks like spam. for it to go viral it needs to be done slowly and meaningfully, eg. 5 or
 10 dollar tips when someone has really done something meaningful.
This done over a period of a year might reach some kind of tipping point...spamming unrelated reddits with hundreds of 5 cent tips is a waste of time

Einstein dies and goes to heaven only to be informed that his room is not yet ready. "I hope you will not mind waiting in a dormitory. We are very sorry, but it's the best we can do and you will have to share the room with others." he is told by the doorman (say his name is Pete). Einstein says that this is no problem at all and that there is no need to make such a great fuss. So Pete leads him to the dorm. They enter and Albert is introduced to all of the present inhabitants. "See, Here is your first room mate. He has an IQ of 180!" "Why that's wonderful!" Says Albert. "We can discuss mathematics!" "And here is your second room mate. His IQ is 150!" "Why that's wonderful!" Says Albert. "We can discuss physics!" "And here is your third room mate. His IQ is 100!" "That Wonderful! We can discuss the latest plays at the theater!" Just then another man moves out to capture Albert's hand and shake it. "I'm your last room mate and I'm sorry, but my IQ is only 80." Albert smiles back at him and says, "So, where to you think interest rates are headed?"

A government currency by definition isn't global, this is where a lot of Bitcoin efficiency comes from. If a currency is global then it could make sense to have an algorithm instead of a central bank controlling the supply.

Correct , but merchants can choose to accept or reject certain denominations in dollars. You have no choice with Bitcoin unless you use some elaborate multisig system. As usd has pre specified denominations it doesn't have the problems to the same extent a bit coin. Ie 1 dollar is always spendable, 1 any unit of bit coin is not because the transaction size can be huge and so incur transaction fees. What I am talking about here is n elephant in the room. It is huge. By the way I am a am a programmer who works with Bitcoin every day and am a massive bull, however this is a huge weakness in terms of the amount of miners fees you pay is determined by how you happened to come into the rights to sign off on certain outputs. The design is insane .
@_date: 2014-05-10 15:56:04
yes I do
@_date: 2014-05-04 20:06:32
Sending maybe, but if I receive  100k in pennies in my bank account, it doesn't mean I have to pay the fees when I come to spend each penny, with Bitcoin you would literally be sent each penny and have to deal with every penny when it came to spend them. There is always a preference to receive value in as few outputs as possible

I disagree they hate Bitcoin, they are unsure, banks live in a regulatory nightmare, they can't take any risks when it comes to money laundering and know your customer regulation, therefore if asked, pushed to take a position they have to say "no".
Banks need to take risk to survive and if Bitcoin presents an opportunity, trust me they will use it. In the current climate (very risk averse) the default response will always be negative. I think this will change.

yes, but then what would you do? You have 1 billion outputs with 5 cents on each and you have to sign off on each one, pay mining fees and use up 279.397 gigbytes of blockchain (currently 279,000 blocks) which would require 5 years of dedicated blockchain to spend...Bitcoin will never work for this kind of application on any scale until it moves to address level ledger, you can come up with workarounds, but the outputs have to be signed individually and spent at some point...see my thread from yesterday and GibbsSamplePlatter's replies
@_date: 2014-04-30 23:37:30
Thanks! I think there might be a way to do what you described with the bundling, however I can well imagine a number would sit unconfirmed also by my calculations if you take the average transaction size of just under 1000 bytes that would take 250,000 transactions, roughly 238 megabytes of blockchain, which is ~238 blocks dedicated to me just for this consolidation.

1. This will happen I think. Banks are too inefficient, bureaucratic to the point of insanity and have terrible technology departments. If crypto doesn't take off, its only a matter of time before they are disrupted by some other technology
2. Bitcoin needs people buying and spending, not buying and holding. I don't expect significant change until Bitcoin is widely available to spend and easy to use. Lets see what the wave of VC money brings to the table in 6 months
3. My wife! I invest all my spare time in my Bitcoin startup so in a way I have a big position in Bitcoin
4. they are printing money and buying government bonds from dealers. this isn't finding its way into peoples pockets, they should just increment everyone's bank accounts by x or remove/cut taxes for the poor/middle class
5. I don't have any figures, but it must be huge, there are so many people employed just to look at this stuff and so many man hours spent discussing. Every employee spends hours doing pointless compliance training so that the bank can tick boxes. My view is that this actually works in banks favor as it puts up massive barriers to entry to the industry. However there is very little innovation within this area of banking, for example Youtube has algorithms for copyright protection, there is no reason why the same can't be done for banking.
5. Some colleagues (idiots) think its stupid, some love it, it always get a lively discussion and everyone agrees it is a good thing in terms of making people think about money.

@_date: 2014-05-20 06:53:06
I agree with your points, but I think you have to find a way to do this without being susceptible to a massive internal attack. Banks get away with this at the moment because they have centralised ledgers and gentleman a agreements to reverse out fraudulent transactions.  If I was Circle's CEO I wouldn't be getting much sleep relying on internal controls.
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:23:08
I mean, you use multisig deterministic addresses , so in order to monitor the addresses do you hold a copy of both master public keys on the server? 
@_date: 2014-05-10 12:30:33
The Blockchain is a phenomenal technology, cryptography protocols in general are, but existed practically in theory before the internet-&gt;peer to peer systems. when you read old cryptography books now with the hindsight of the internet they are truly enlightening. It comes down to trust, given a choice of having to trust a person/entity or not having to, I would always choose the latter. Given a choice between centralization and decentralization is more complex, but if the incentives in the system are setup right, decentralized systems can be much more trustworthy. the Bitcoin protocol and it's Blockchain is a thing of beauty, it inspires me every day to think that humans not only came up with this concept but executed on it.

So you assign nodes on your the BIP32 address space to your contacts? And they can then generate addresses for you automatically?
@_date: 2014-06-16 11:09:35
Is this because your multi-sig is 2 of 2, so if you sign off on it via your site you know there is no way anyone else could have signed the same transaction elsewhere?
Where as a 2 of 3 multi-sig with the user holding 2 keys, one hot, one cold, there could be a double spend attempt from the user using their hot and cold key without your involvement?
The trade off for this is the need for lock-time transactions for the user to recover their wallet in the event you disappear?

Ok, will attempt tomorrow, will cost me 0.1 BTC to send it, assuming I don't get banned for dos
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:02:53
You don't really receive bitcoins at addresses, you revive them on outputs which the key pair represented by your address have the ability to sign off on. 1 bitcoin arriving at your address could be comprised of any number of outputs. When you come to spend these outputs you have to create a transaction that includes them all. If over the years you revived lots of small outputs, your address "balance" might say 1 BTC but it could actually be comprised of 1000 small outputs which have to be included in any transaction. This means you pay the transaction fee for 1000* however many bytes the outputs are when you spend it.
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:37:44
think I understand, I have a P2SH address which says if the correct signature is provided the nodes should total up the amount of satoshis in all outputs for address, validate the amount, then use the address itself as an input to transaction (thereby implicitly spending all unspent outputs associated with the address at that time) which spends the 1m single 1$ into a single $1m output.
A big update to the protocol, but perhaps something that needs to be tested by a side-chain. My worry is that Bitcoin is actually not fungible, as changing small amounts into big is not free. Ie if you are going to send me $1000 i would rather you sent me one output rather than 1000 as 1000 are more expensive to spend, whether though transaction fees, blockchain bloat or just convenience.
Thanks for your advice on this.
@_date: 2014-05-10 12:42:41
I don't mean the name itself, dogecoin etc. is essentially bitcoin, they all are. But the media, government, law enforcement, regulators etc. know the name Bitcoin now, it is very easy for them to manipulate Bitcoin's reputation due to the volume of political material out there surrounding it. Bitcoin has the highest cap and so will obviously be the target. I think this can be resolved with more investment and more clarity in explaining Bitcoin to everyone- for example, it isn't really that anonymous and can be incredibly efficient to audit and be compliant with.

@_date: 2014-05-10 12:10:39
I have a small amount for experimentation. bitfinex look interesting, liquidity provision is essential for the price stability relative to other currencies in order to drive the adoption of Bitcoin. People holding Bitcoin should probably take more risk and provide liquidity to the market in this sense. Their holdings will only increase in value if Bitcoin becomes adopted, but Bitcoin will only become adopted if liquidity is high and so price volatility is low. I don't know any forex trader who actively trades in Bitcoin, however I work for one of the biggest banks so they are likely conservative.
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:28:57
I'm working on a model to try and predict the implications, the fact some units of Bitcoins are worth more than others is worrying (true in all currencies but more so here because you don't have control over the outputs you receive) but also it maybe that Bitcoins also contain an embedded option on future mining transaction fees, for example, you hold 10000 0.2 cent outputs which some bastard transferred to you without you realizing over the years, which you can't spend unless mining fees fall below x...just 20 bucks, but unspendable- a single output 20 is free to transfer. Maybe we all end up with dust and satoshi and the miners are sipping pinocoladas on their island somewhere
I realize there are strategies around this., such as netting the  outputs together over time and using coin joining to minimize block chain bloat, I am interested in the systemic implications
An address level ledger would be ideal ( ie what you assumed it was) I am not sure if this is cryptographically possible or not. If it is, why wasn't this done in the first place?
@_date: 2014-12-06 14:49:52
The original:
@_date: 2014-05-05 08:37:38
but not to spend them- to count them you would just weigh them. The bank will take them and give you the exact amount in your account, which you can withdraw in any denomination. So I can convert my pennies into 10 dollar bills at no cost. With Bitcoin you have to pay a transaction fee for each penny to do this.

Completely wrong, inputs are signed off on at the output level, if you have 100 outputs tied to an address: that is 100 outputs and 100 signatures you need link to the transaction inputs
Addresses aren't coins, outputs are coins.

@_date: 2014-04-30 22:41:57

yep, no service should exist without madatory 2fa, frankly blockchain.info should not be operating like this, they are trading Bitcoin's and their reputation for number of accounts in their database. (easier to onboard users without madatory 2fa)

I have no idea about trading
Regulation I know a little
Friends and colleagues are massively interested
My start up will change the world!

nope, if I have 1 Bitcoin on 1 output my transaction size is small, i can use a standard miners fee to pay the Bitcoin to another address. If I have 1 Bitcoin  composed of 100m satoshis on 100m outputs (extreme example for illustration) it is worthless and unspendable.
I have to sign off on all the 100m outputs and include them in my transaction whcih will add up to around 300x100m bytes- a lot of miners fees.
A more realistic example is this, would you rather receive a Bitcoin on 1 output or 20? A Bitcoin on one output is worth more than a Bitcoin on 20 outputs.
@_date: 2014-05-04 19:57:11
Correct, the transaction you create will be a lot more bytes and so you pay a higher miners fee
@_date: 2014-05-01 00:36:47
I still have to sign off on all those inputs though, which in this scenario is 1m signatures and even with optimisation ~238 blocks dedicated to me just for this consolidation.

"It was on her phone. No option for 2 factor."
How exactly was it compromised? someone got into her phone and sent from the app? or her phone was stolen and hacked? or the enc packet was hacked online?

That's an API feature. You can  register an existing set of keys using their API and move your funds to it. They leave the key storage up to you. No real difference to setting up any other wallet apart from you register the address space with coinbase to make it easy to transfer out. AFAIK.
What would be true control is you setup a wallet which they don't have access to the keys to, and any BTC purchase goes directly into that wallet immediately

Yes, plus you can allocate nodes off a bip32 deterministic key hierarchy via pgp and a one time verification to allow an (effective) unlimited addresses to be created on each other's behalf - for all time.
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:38:51
How would you approach it?
@_date: 2014-05-10 22:10:57
"They pay their taxes etc." I mean they have nothing to hide and so won't adopt Bitcoin purely to avoid traditional banking
@_date: 2014-05-04 13:56:47
Another important property is that units are fungible, eg 1 dollar is always worth 1 dollar, with Bitcoin this is not the case
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:19:10
Exactly, and the joke was to illustrate no one really knows anything when it comes to making predictions about the economy- you would have to be stupid to think you can!

That is one method, but what would they do with it? Have a cup of coffee verify

A Satoshi is unspendable , 100 satoshis are unspendable, 1000 satoshis are unspendable...

Regulation is a mess, banks have different departments, the traditional investment banking wing which might have done the IPO is separate from the equity research division, is separate from the equity trading division. This is "regulated". They still go for beers together.

I gave it some thought, but this is a really perfect use case for off-chain centralised ledger transactions finally settled on the blockchain. I can't think of a better way to implement it on-chain / payment protocol etc. Especially when it comes to introdcing new users to Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:18:20
that joke is awesome
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:08:45
Haha, yeah, it does sound a bit cliched doesn't it...

in the uk, you break the law if you refuse to hand over encryption keys for data on your computer. not a stretch to imagine laws where you have to legally provide a master public key if requested to under the threat of prison

I don't know the details of changetip's infosec etc. but yes, I agree offchain-decentralised would be better if you can make it equally or more user friendly from the popint of view of someone receiving their first tip.
ie. no key management or writing down phrases required...

It's a good product, as far as you trust coinapult to manage your assets. I would like to see proof of customer account segregation and proof of investment in the locked asset. Is this part of the service?
The risk being that coinapult start taking market risk with the pooled assets of all it's customers. Providing you with the lock but not actually investing the full amount in dollars or gold, instead investing based on their market view and trying to turn a profit.
@_date: 2014-05-04 15:49:26
It actually isn't possible as the nodes will just drop it as spam, each transaction need to be over  around 5000 satoshis to get accepted so I would need to spend a lot more to prove my point. I was going to run a script to send a Satoshi every second for 10,000 seconds, then ask you to send the 0.0001 bit coin somewhere
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:19:33
I think it can, you can run a java applet on there i believe, so could act as a signing device. Would be good in tandem with  a mutli-sig signing service so your key doesn't have to be stored on a local device. There is also an NFC yubikey which might make for some nice applications...

This service should launch end of Nov, allows you to build a whitelisted network via PGP and has multi-sig sign off on integrity of addesses. All addresses are HD too.
@_date: 2015-09-04 01:00:34
you will make very little profit anyway, i would suggest run up a full node and solo mine simply to contribute to the network and decentalisation
@_date: 2015-03-04 00:33:49
Have a look at Ninki Wallet, this is very close to the functionality you describe
