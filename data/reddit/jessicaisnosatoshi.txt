someone mentioned that they got bitcoin sent by accident....this just happened to me, too...???  anyone else? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:57:38
I sold my bitcoin the other day, and now my wallet has reloaded with about 2.5x what I had....????

I would suggest you keep staring at it.  All day, every day, 24/7, for each blip is a possible buy or sell opportunity.  Be sure to keep your eye on that blip.  if it goes up, watch it.  If it goes down, watch that too.  And then tell us all about it.  /s

You could completely lose it all depending on how the net neutrality vote affects a sell off.  Be prepared to hold if there is a big sell off.  It might come back later.

@_date: 2017-12-13 16:21:00
don't worry, when the FCC rules on net neutrality, it could drop like a rock.  strap in...and get prepared! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:46:04
no, just some fun entertainment to lighten the mood to demonstrate how invested they are in their business. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:50:29
chill the fuck out.  assume you will lose it all.  if you don't, you win.  stop investing what you cannot afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:42:26
it could go to 12,000 even 6,000 is not out of the question right now

@_date: 2017-12-13 16:32:38
buckle up and watch the net neutrality vote.  It could send things down....and quick!

You need to consider the downside always.  hold or don't.  I say this to people who do not understand what they are doing.  HOLD, or SELL, there's no crying in crypto.  We are not here to give you advice. You are not a "Hodler and believer" unless you understand that there are no guarantees and have the stomach to deal with the downside.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:16:38
There is a massive correction going on right now.  Take this time to educate yourself and learn as much as possible before you make any moves.  Be prepared to lose every dollar you put in.

No, but somebody may get to drive a Tesla on Mars.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:59:05
I am hodl (for this moment) .  bought in at 250.  took profits at 17, 15 and 12.  I will get out if it goes to 5000, it will still set me up for early retirement.  buying real estate in what looks like a bear market coming.  I'd rather get monthly income from tenants than watch this crater.  Anyone wants to pair up on a couple of apartment deals in S. Florida, hit me up.
