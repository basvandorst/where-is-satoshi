Amateur Miners : Feedback requested. 
Over the past few months at least I have seen the rise in people becoming "Bitcoin Miners". Facebook groups, Telegram groups etc all popping up for people to 
A: Post pictures of their Rigs
B: Ask questions about hashrates
C: "Having had my rig running for a couple of days I’m now starting to think about wallet solutions"
I think its good to have questions about hashrates, overclocking etc, my worry is that there are so many people getting involved in mining that have no idea what they are actually doing. Is this a good thing? 
I've run a bunch of surveys on these groups, asking if they knew what they were doing - like do they know what the roles of the miner is on the network etc and its a pretty clear no, the majority has no idea what they are doing. 
Is it too small and insignificant thing to be worried about? Would like to hear other peoples views on the matter.

You're being paid to do a job and that job is to keep the network fair and secure - that's true for most of the altcoins. Free money is much better when you're just given it. 
I guess my question is should we push for more education for miners? I see miners kind of like farmers I guess and that yeah, anyone can just buy a chicken and get free eggs or buy more chickens and sell some eggs, but with some basic farming knowledge you could grow much better chickens .... I think that analogy was a bad one. 
Anyway, I kind of see miners like what old time farmers were like, there were lots of then that provides a great service, and over time there were less, but we still kinda need them. 
Mining IS worth the money, IF the circumstances are right ( electricity, price of parts, assuming coins still use POW etc ) but is it also worth trying to educate miners and does it matter either way, because I think with a little education they could be better miners...maybe.
