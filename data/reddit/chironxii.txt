This is actually good news.

This is an ignorant point of view IMO. Most small and medium businesses already rely on intermediaries for processing all of their credit and debit transactions, and for good reason: it's a pain to manage, and also a risk. Every minute they spend messing with it is a minute they aren't doing productive work. 
The problem is even more significant with crypto. We cannot expect every bakery and mechanic to invest the time to become an expert and implement their own resilient solution. 
What we need is to establish clear rules and guidelines for the crypto space to allow companies and investors to feel secure embracing the platform and investing time and money in developing competitive solutions, in addition to better outreach to educate people into supporting and choosing good providers.
Bitpay is successful because they fill a need.
Edit: of course, it depends on your interests and desires for what you want cryptocurrency to be, ultimately. My argument is assuming that you want wider adoption and development of crypto as a platform.

The network is designed to compensate, yes, but it is still vulnerable to attack. In your example any entity could cripple the network by dominating the hashrate for a very small investment - this has happened to a fair number of small altcoins. That's all I meant.
@_date: 2015-03-27 19:44:19
That's not actually the case. In order to ensure security of the network, total hashing power needs to be high enough that it would require an inordinate investment for any individual to compromise.

Same here, I first heard about it basically when the reward went from 50 to 25, I think it was somewhere around $20. I was going to buy a few but after messing with it I decided it was too much of a pain to link my bank account. Poor choice.
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:12:06
I wish I had 30k to invest a year ago.
Even then if I'm being honest I'd have probably panic sold waaaay before now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:15:11
Just saw someone sell 600 BTC on bitstamp for $491...
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:36:22
Same here. Then I looked at it *again* after the April crash and still didn't bother... man.
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:45:26
Hell, I already knew what it was and I still clicked it.
Then I realized bitcoins are up at $350 and I was very sad I didn't pay attention a year ago.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:36:26
If you ate it and used those calories to earn money to buy more bitcoins, then yes.
@_date: 2013-11-12 00:27:46
How exactly do I import the keys to spend what's on the paper wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:32:49
Moon isn't high enough. To Mars!
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:42:33
I am too, I have a little bit but sadly I didn't get verified quickly enough to catch it before this rise.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:37:38
I'd put the Moon at around $1000. Pretty crazy but *just* reasonable enough that we might get there.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:44:19
Back up for me.
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:35:06
A lot of people keep saying that it should drop at least some soon, but it's hard to tell whether they just *want* it to. Same situation as you, pretty much :(
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:44:22
Ahhh, I was looking at multibit, which apparently doesn't do that (not easily anyway). Does the subreddit have a favorite client? 
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:08:52
I'm pretty new to bitcoin myself, but from what I've seen mining contracts are pretty iffy.
Grain of salt and all that, but you might make a post to get someone with experience.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:14:12
That was a tense moment there, but I think we just saw how many people are waiting to jump on cheap coins. Going to take more than that to pop this one, it seems.
^^^Note ^^^that ^^^I ^^^have ^^^no ^^^idea ^^^what ^^^I'm ^^^talking ^^^about.
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:03:22
That's actually a really good guess as to what it might be.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:47:38
Why don't I ever see these gifs? I was even watching this time.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:05:36
Not quite yet, seems to be holding... someone just dropped 600 BTC at $490 though.
@_date: 2013-11-09 10:15:56
This is probably the coolest thing I've seen in a looooong time.
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:42:51
Holy hell you weren't kidding, spreading some serious love.
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:51:46
Damn, that's quite a tip.
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:35:13
Oh yes, I tried to get some when they were a bit cheaper than now, only to realize that it's kind of a pain and I have to verify accounts ect, so sadly I'm still waiting on that.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:53:25
I love watching the charts and just seeing a quarter million dollars fly by. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:34:32
You might offend some people calling it virtual currency rather than digital.
Also it might work better if you flipped the private key flap around so you could see the public key without exposing the private one.
Other than that, it looks great!
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:51:24
Yeah but that doesn't help if it takes *them* three days to verify my bank account. 
Unless I'm misunderstanding what this means, but I'm still waiting. :(
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:37:45
I thought they couldn't use that because they don't have the keys?
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:38:20
You could sell every bitcoin there is for $1000 and not even touch it. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:41:12
I felt very bad for you until I got to the last sentence.
