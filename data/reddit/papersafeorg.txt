So far most people have been buying them as collectors.... and they will not load any coins on them.....Its the first of its kind.. and they are jumping all over them.....Not your average physical bitcoin

what do you mean securely provide a key.....I use bitaddress.org on an off line PC with its own Laser printer, The addresses password is randomly picked from 100 million to 500 trillion then converted to hex...That password is then entered into bitaddress.org to encrypt the Private key.
As soon as the sheet comes off the printer it is covered with a scratch off and then the hologram.... concealing the password until the hologram sticker is removed then the scratch off can be removed.....
The public and private keys could be used for just registering the Satoshi note to the blockchain.... The NFC tag on the reverse side can store anything bitcoin address related up to 888 bytes.. I believe the real magic is in the NFC Tag.. when the Satoshi Note is purchased the tag is programmed to Authenticate the certificate with Trustpoints BLACKSEAL authentication  software... The tag can be erased and a greenaddress log in can be programmed .....making a papersafe wallet an HD wallet......

The NFC tag on the note can be used to add easy access to Greenaddress app  ...making the Satoshi Sote an HD wallet

Not at this time.... I have been kicking around ideas for a print your own Keys wallet.... They would be a single use storage. The Satoshi notes  can be redeemed if need be but are meant to load and collected/ store your coins or traded as a loaded bill
