Maybe not on its own. But there are many small reasons like this. And taken together they make a very compelling case.
It's quite clear that Bitcoin is simply better money. The only reason not to use it currently is that nobody is using it. As soon as everyone starts using it then everyone will wonder how on earth they managed to survive without.
It's like the first telephone. It was useless when only one person has one.

For me personally it's not hate. Rather, I'm just so tired of fiat.
 - Ever increasing numbers of heavy metal coins in my wallet
 - Having to handle dirty paper money (hopefully not a vector for Ebola)
 - Bank transactions taking a full day, three days at weekends
 - Searching for an ATM twice a week to get old-fashioned cash
 - etc.
Fiat is just old school and I'm eager to move forward at long last.

There's still no easy way to sweep a paper wallet to a phone, is there?
Schildbach doesn't allow it, nor does the blockchain.info web app. Mycelium requires you to enable "expert mode" (not newbie friendly). And iPhone is a complete non-starter.
I'd love to give out paper wallets to Bitcoin newcomers, but without them being able to easily transfer the balance to their phone it's just pointless.

Well, that paragraph is correct. But they've overlooked the fact that the computing power required to mine only grows if more miners are attempting to mine. If mining becomes unprofitable and so the miners stop or slow down, then the required computing power will stabilise, or even decrease. It's a self-balancing equilibrium. It's an obvious concept once you understand it, but many people don't understand.
@_date: 2014-10-07 14:10:48

BTC doesn't "crash" by 50% very often. If you look at the entire exchange rate history it's mostly stable. Only for a few weeks each year does it ramp up 10x then correct, overshoot, re-correct, then stabilise again.
@_date: 2014-07-09 23:41:07
Half then half again, which makes 75%. Or 15.75 million.

The hardest part about setting up a Bitcoin ATM is not building/buying the machine, it's not finding a suitable venue, it's not connecting it up to an exchange, it's not the day-to-day management. No, the hardest thing, by a long long long margin, is complying with your country's financial regulations.
The regulations vary from country to country, but in most cases if you run it as a non-commercial operation, and you keep the volume very low (like under $100 per day) then no license is required. Any more than that and you need a license.
Getting a license is usually very time consuming and expensive. It's beyond the reach of a hobbyist. You basically need a working relationship with a bank who will let you operate under their money transmitter license. And in order to comply with the license, you need AML/KYC systems in place. This means the machine needs to record the personal identities of people buying/selling Bitcoin along with how much and when they are buying/selling. This is usually achieved through user registration, a one-time recording of ID documents, plus biometric identification for every transaction.

Owning a bitcoin means you know that coin's private key.

There will be no "official" stock split (whatever "official" means).
Rather, what will happen is as follows:
* People refer to 100 satoshi as a unit with the name "bit" (already happens)
* The "bit" becomes the usual unit in wallet software (already sometimes the case, e.g. Breadwallet)
* Everyone everywhere is using the term "bits" (wallets, exchanges, documentation)
* General public starts colloqually calling a "bit" a "bitcoin" (they'd be incorrect, but it doesn't matter)
* The colloqualism becomes adopted as the standard
If the Bitcoin Foundation manages to establish 1 XBT as the ISO standard for 100 satoshi then it'll help this process along.

Great work! It's good to see the wallet continually improve.
One question, if I may...
I'm still puzzled why mobile wallets have an address book.
Does anyone use this feature? I never do.
Addresses are supposed to be one-time use anyway.
I have no reason to even be aware of addresses, let alone save them.
Transaction labeling would be more useful. Having a record of what each transaction was for. I realise that by labeling a one-use address that is effectively the same as labeling a transaction, but it seems to me a non-intuitive way of doing things.

The standard Bitcoin wallet for Android needs a "sweep private key" function. All the other alternatives are too complicated for noobs (as demonstrated by the complexity of comments in this thread).
Freebie paper wallets are commonly given out by evangelists. Schildbach's refusal to implement the sweep feature is a barrier to popular adoption of Bitcoin.
With this feature I'd envision the procedure for OP to be as follows:
* Install Bitcoin app from Play store
* Tap "Menu / Sweep private key"
* Point camera at QR code and click OK
That's it. Bitcoin on phone and ready to spend.

You need to create an account first though. That isn't digital cash. That's a bank account.
One big selling point of Bitcoin is that it's digital cash. It'd be good to install a wallet with one tap from Google Play. Then scan a paper wallet with one tap. You now have Bitcoin on your phone. This is how you introduce Bitcoin to friends within 60 seconds while in a noisy restaurant.

The first step is to make XBT the official currency code, and 1 XBT = 100 satoshi.

You don't seem to understand that there is no decimal point in the block chain or in the protocol.
The placement of a decimal point is merely set by wallet software.

Not sure if you're trolling, or just badly misinformed, but in case anyone else reading gets the wrong impression, here are the facts...
Bitcoin only came online, for the first time ever, the genesis block, in January 2009. No countries were making laws about it that year, not Germany nor anywhere else. Bitcoin didn't even have any value in 2009, there were no exchanges and there was no market.
In 2013 the German Finance Ministry clarified the rules regarding taxation of Bitcoin. Any realised gains are to be declared as income, subject to regular income tax. The exception is if the gains are made more than 12 months after you bought the Bitcoin.
Full details, in German, are here:

Then 1 bitcoin = 100 satoshi - nice two decimal system like every other currency.
Total supply is then 21 trillion bitcoin, a large number, enough for a global economy (psychological).
And again psychologically, 1 bitcoin then seems really "cheap", which encourages adoption.
To me it's a no-brainer, but lots of people seem resistant to this idea for some reason.

A high quality, easy to use, iOS wallet. GreenAddress and Blockchain are too difficult currently. Hive on Android is getting there, but still needs UX work also.
Plus, a much higher market cap. If we have another large spike in price - presumably driven by Wall Street investors - combined with user-friendly mobile wallets, that's when mass adoption will begin.
Having lots of merchants at the ready to accept Bitcoin is essential too. That's happening. Just got to hope these merchants don't give up after a year because adoption was to show.

You don't. Instead you do a normal transfer from one to the other. It'll only cost 0.0001 BTC in fees. With mobile wallets going HD nowadays you no longer have just one private key anyway, you have multiple keys and would have to export and import all of them. Even then, the imported keys wouldn't be derived from your seed, thus won't be included if you ever need to do a backup recovery from that seed.

It's only anecdotal evidence, but I personally have found that giving people free money (Bitcoin) is ineffective. I have concluded that by giving it away you give the impression that it is worthless. Nowadays, whenever a friend shows interest in Bitcoin, I always make sure to sell it to them, even if it's just $10 worth. And if they're not interested in paying, then they're not yet ready for Bitcoin.

Have a look at the HotButler/Deltacom Bitcoin ATMs in the central railway station. They're easy to find, just wander around within the main building at ground level, you'll see them on a wall next to some regular bank ATMs. They kind of look like public telephones. Two of them. Once you've found them, marvel at how absolutely shitty they are. They run Windows XP with Internet Exporer version 6 or something, and the user interface looks like it was designed by an 8-year-old. They don't take paper notes, only coins and plastic. And the Bitcoins take 12 to 24 hours before they're delivered to your email.

This is great news! Address reuse is the one major thing that troubles me about the current version.
Very minor request: Can we get some consistency in capitalisation of the menu items? For example "Exchange Rates" and "Network Monitor" should be changed to "Exchange rates" and "Network monitor". In fact, all the text used through out the app could do with some grammar cleaning and tightening up. E.g. in settings you have "Data usage" but then "Report Issue" (inconsistent capitalisation).
It's not at all important to the functionality of course, but some text polish would make the whole app just that much more professional.

I was wondering this yesterday too, so I just took a risk and tried it. Sent 0.015 BTC through two rounds and it took about 2 minutes. Worked fine.
However, out of the ~20 other coins that were mixed with mine, it was trivial to follow the path that my coins took. You just look for the outputs with your starting value minus the 0.0001 BTC transaction fee for each round.
So the mixing isn't particularly thorough, but the service does work.

Note that he says "change the display".
That's all it is. A display issue.
There's nothing in the protocol or the block chain that dictates where the decimal point is placed. It's merely a convenience that wallets to date have chosen 8 decimal places (including Bitcoin Core, the reference wallet).
I am fully in favour of making XBT an official ISO designated currency symbol. The sooner the better and I applaud people who are working hard to achieve this.
I also don't mind a great deal what XBT is defined as. But please don't argue for a particular definition based on a faulty understanding of how the block chain works.

Here in Europe a SEPA transfer is legally required to go through within three business days, and usually goes through within one business day.
Trouble is, if you start the transfer at 5pm on Thursday it will miss that day's processing. So transfer is actually only initiated on Friday morning. But then it's the weekend, so the "one business day" means it won't arrive until Monday earliest.
So in that case you're also left waiting at least 4 days, and often it's 5. That's for the supposed "new and improved" so-called SEPA system.

It's like an online bank, but all the accounts are public.
The full database of accounts can be downloaded by anyone.
Each account, however, is anonymous, identified only by a "key" not a real name.
If you own bitcoin, you own a balance in this distributed database and your key can access it.
When you spend or receive bitcoin, the balance in the accounts is adjusted across all online copies of the database.
Only you know your key (it's like a password) and if you lose this, you lose access to spend your money.

1) I have my phone with me always. Why should I have to carry a wallet as well if I want to go shopping? Bitcoin offers the possibility of one item in my pocket: integrated phone and wallet.
2) Cash is unhygienic.
3) No need to find an ATM whenever I need cash. I just need Internet. And Internet access is more prevalent than ATMs.
4) Bitcoin can be backed up in case I lose my phone. Cash can't be backed up in case I lose my wallet.
5) No need to mess around with change, or the inability to "break a note". With Bitcoin the exact amount can be paid every time.
There are lots more reasons. None of them on their own is persuasive, but taken together they become very persuasive.
Right now the Bitcoin infrastructure and economy is not large enough to make Bitcoin completely compelling. But forward-thinking people can see the benefits and if we keep pushing forward then eventually critical mass will be reached. Once that happens everyone will wonder how on earth we even survived on paper money, the same as we wonder now how anyone could survive before Internet.

Zero confirmations is fine for low-value transactions. It only takes a few seconds to check for a double spend attempt. For higher value transactions people will be happy to wait the extra time for confirmations to come through.
Strictly speaking, in Bitcoin there is no such thing as "time to clear" anyway. Rather, the level to which a transaction is "cleared" is a sliding scale. The more confirmations the more "cleared" it is. The default Bitcoin client arbitrarily defines six confirmations as "cleared".

The German account started, around early March 2013, receiving larger and larger numbers of deposits, often from Eastern European countries. This triggered AML detectors, and the German account was blocked. The German authorities investigated, noticed a connection to the Polish account, and asked the Poles to block that too. The block is for a maximum of three months while the matter is investigated more closely. The block could be lifted earlier if things are cleared up.
In short: The sudden spike in deposts (coinciding with the spike in the BTC exchange rate) tripped an AML trigger.

With ongoing development of the Bitcoin infrastructure however, including things like these ATMs, then over the next three to five years Bitcoin will gradually transition to a currency that you can use in everyday life.

*Some in the press speculated that our guidance was an attempt to clamp down on virtual currency providers. I will not deny that there are some troublesome providers out there.

A whole host of emerging technologies in the financial sector have proven their capacity to empower customers, encourage the development of innovative financial products, and expand access to financial services.

It's good PR though, to have a static highly-public vanity address.
It means news articles can link to it and write headlines like "$4,000 donated via Bitcoin". It's good for Snowden and it's good for Bitcoin. 
Secondly, I personally feel more inclined to donate when I can see how many others have donated. I suspect others are the same. It's a well known fact that a social media post gets more "likes" if others have already "liked" it. Same with Bitcoin donations.
Ideal would be to have two payment methods. One to a static common address, another to a rotating unique address. Then donors can choose which they prefer.

Something I'm not clear on, are there virgin addresses already in existence that have 25 BTC on them, and we're just waiting for those addresses to be discovered by miners? Or do the miners create 25 BTC out of thin air and assign it to an address that previously had a balance of 0 in the blockchain (or, rather, wasn't in the blockchain)? I mean, if I sampled randomly created addresses, could I get really really lucky and happen to find one with 25 BTC on it that is not yet in the blockchain?

Because Bitcoin is not popular as a currency yet. It will spend another couple of years as a speculative investment and a store of value. Once its market cap has increased by one or two orders of magnitude, then it'll start to take off as a currency.

One of the Bitcoin blogs that does nothing other than copy content from the subreddit and bitcointalk then turns it into a blog post. That gets picked up by Gizmag or Techcrunch. It then makes its way onto RT, then Washington Post, gradually moving up the food chain of "legitimate" news outlets.

Another a theory is that Bitcoin was invented by Google, but that Google will never admit to it.
The Google founders talked about creating "Google Bucks", an idea similar to Bitcoin, but backed off because it would be illegal in the US and many other countries. See Eric Schmidt say this in [a video from February 2012](
So it's possible they went ahead and created it anyway, but in such a way that their product couldn't be traced back to them. Maybe it is just the two Google founders, plus Eric Schmidt, and one or two developers who know about it.
Also, one of Google's employees worked closely with Satoshi in developing Bitcoin during it's first year (as well as continuing to work on it today). Mike Hearn is [quoted in this video]( (first 15 seconds) saying "*in April 2009 it was basically just me and Satoshi*".
It's possible that Mike was "encouraged" by Google to work on Bitcoin without being told that Bitcoin was actually a Google product. This would be similar to the way in which Gavin was kind of "duped" into becoming lead developer by Satoshi (Satoshi asked if Gavin would like to be named on the developers contact page, what Satoshi didn't say was that he'd be removing his own name from that page).
Not saying I believe it necessarily, but it's a theory.
Either way, I do think Google is sympathetic to Bitcoin and are just waiting for it become more mainstream before they endorse it fully.

It's happening guys!

I don't think anyone knows. And those who might, or who have strong suspicions, are keeping quiet out of respect.
@_date: 2013-08-14 19:30:22
If they do have any then securing the private keys would be an interesting problem. The fact that we've not heard how this is done makes me think that no, they don't have any.

From page 1:


Oh dear. They spelt it wrong throughout the article too.

Can we get forexmagnates.com banned from this subreddit? They post nothing but shite.

Connect a bitcoin.de account with a fidor.de account and you can buy and sell Bitcoin instantly without waiting for bank transfers.
@_date: 2013-06-11 17:03:30
Wow, that was fantastic. I couldn't fault anything he said. And he's not even a super bull, in fact he claims to own no Bitcoin at all yet.
@_date: 2013-03-28 07:54:21
Banks are closed here in Germany from Friday through Monday inclusive. But on BTC24 you can pay instantly via Giropay 24/7. There's a 2% fee, but that's nothing compared to the daily price increase. Anything could happen over Easter, I don't think a dip is a certainty, especially not if too many people are expecting it.
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:52:34
Correct. Bitcoin is not a bubble, it's a battering ram. Each boom and crash cycle brings it closer to breaking the global banking cartel.
@_date: 2013-09-19 10:22:04
Currency war.

I wonder what'll happen to the bitcoins.

Makes it sound informal and "folksy" though. That's how Bush got into power, after all.

Great post, it could have been written by Satoshi himself.

"Looking into it" probably means he got as far as reading the Wikipedia article but nothing more. When the Bitcoin market cap matches the PayPal annual revenue, maybe then they'll look at it more seriously. But Bitcoin needs to reach $600 before that happens.

Correct. Plus500 is NOT offering Bitcoin trading. Although they did test it for a day.

Helium will go up, that's for sure.

Great news! Congratulations to Oliver and team for pulling this off.
By the way, as an aside, I notice from the Fidor Bank pricelist that SEPA transfers over €12,500 must be registered with the government. I think this is true for all banks in Germany though.

Because there probably aren't any actual investors yet. It's like when WordPress started accepting Bitcoin, everyone jizzed their pants about it. Nine months later we find out that only 2 BTC has ever been spent on WordPress.
@_date: 2013-08-13 13:45:20
It's similar in German too: "Tresor" means "safe" or "vault"
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:09:11
I'm not sure it's a core protocol problem. It's more a problem with blockchain.info. They should enforce 2FA for both logging in and for withdrawals.

Seriously. I can never remember which company does what because they all have the same name.

I remember back in the nineties when HIGNFY first mentioned the internet. Angus Deayton asked Paul Merton if he'd "logged on". Paul replied, "no, it's just the way I'm sitting". Bitcoin now reminds me of how the internet was back then.

This and the African Kipochi M-Pesa thing are the two biggest developments in Bitcoin so far this week. Little by little the worldwide Bitcoin infrastructure is being built out. In 12 to 18 months Bitcoin will be ready to take the world by storm again.

...and Kraken.

I think he's just mad. Not mad for any particular reason, just plain mad. Old, crazy, and no longer in touch.

Looks like it has gone through now. 73 confirmations as I write this. Good to know, I have occasionally wondered myself what would happen in such a scenario.
@_date: 2013-07-23 09:00:08
Thanks for that!
@_date: 2013-09-18 20:23:53
Wordpress say that since they started accepting Bitcoin they've taken "a couple of hundred dollars" worth of business that way. Hopefully BigPoint does better.
@_date: 2013-11-01 16:19:03
Oh fuck off.
@_date: 2013-11-02 19:49:55
It'll all kick off on Monday afternoon, and even more so again on Tuesday and Wednesday. I wouldn't be surprised if we hit $300 by the end of the week.

I believe in Germany the banks are legally obliged to report all transactions over a certain figure.

No known virus could physically destroy Iranian nuclear fuel centrifuges, until Stuxnet was discovered.

I still think people are best off discovering Bitcoin and aquiring some for themselves. If you're given something as a gift it doesn't have as much value as if you sought out possession yourself. I gave away coins to 10 people a few months back and only 2 have ever done anything with them.
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:04:25
OK, thx.

Don't fight the law. Instead just route around it. Use Bitcoin.

My goodness, Twitter is utterly shit, isn't it?
Or am I doing it wrong?
It's impossible to follow any kind of conversation over there.

Bitcoin only needs to go viral in one country, and I mean really *really* viral such that *everyone* has it, and then other countries of the world will fall like dominoes behind it.
@_date: 2013-03-27 11:33:27
It's hard to imagine what kind of regulation the US or EU could impose. Shutting down the exchanges, maybe? Even then, it would just drive the exchanges offshore. I actually suspect governments will embrace bitcoin. I don't think they'll have any choice.

Nothing. It's just Forexminute spam that's been upvoted by their own army of fake reddit accounts.

When a headline ends with a question mark the answer is usually "no". This is an exception to the rule though.

Rang is German for rank, so together with the decimal commas I guess this was compiled by a German.

I was wondering when this would happen.
Instead of seeing headlines like "Company XYZ now accepts Bitcoin" we will see "Company XYZ abandons Bitcoin citing lack of sales".
Hopefully growth will outpace attrition.
