I get what you're going after, but honestly, Bitcoin isn't exactly a privacy coin...

I'm riding this train with you bud!
I love Bitcoin and crypto in general. But the idea that it's going to bring down major financial institutions is the stupidest idea. Even if Bitcoin took over as the only form of currency in the entire world, you're telling me that the banks aren't going to find a way to monetize it? That's so blindsided.
Wells Fargo will start offering cold storage of your funds so that it's secure. Don't want to deal with passkeys? How about an access card that's directly linked to your wallet so you can make convenient purchases at the store.
Don't have enough BTC to buy that house? Wells Fargo will cover the costs of the house and you just have to repay them inonthly installments until it's all paid back.
No one is scared of crypto. Banks are well-positioned to deal with crypto whenever it becomes mainstream.

I get where you're coming from, but when were talking "decentralization", what does that really mean? If the currency was truly decentralized, who am I paying a fee to just to transfer the money? Why does the currency need a CEO? 
On the surface, crypto looks very different than regular currency, but when you take a deeper dive, it's all kind of the same. Instead of a bank, there's an exchange. Instead of the government overseeing the operation, it's whatever leadership team is in place.
Again, I'm all in for Bitcoin and others to be the new standard, but we'd be doing ourselves a disservice if we didn't recognize that there's just as many faults in this space.

I'm all for crypto and I'm invested in a few different coins, but even I can acknowledge that the whole "disrupting and decentralizing the traditional market" argument was pretty far fetched. 
We just replaced Wells Fargo with coinbase. And replaced the government with software developers and showmen like Ver.
