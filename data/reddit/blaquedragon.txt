Hate? If by hate you mean hating the system modern day capitalism has rigged that essentially turns the 21st century male into nothing more then expendable resource. Or hating how it is that as a man you can spend your entire life building and earning success, and a woman can enter that life, marry you, all of a sudden decide she doesn't want you anymore, file for divorce and walk away with half of what **she had no hand in earning herself**. If that's what you mean by hate, yes...you're 100% correct. If that's not what you mean, you're just another cog in the machine. A statistic to be counted, recorded and used. Me? Been there. Done that. Was married 7 years. 7 years I'll never get back.
And before you try to play the "you hate women" card like your type typically do...no, I don't. I hate how women can claim they want equality, but only the type that favor them. Beneficial equality is not equality. Equality is getting all of the perks we as men get, and also all of the burdens, hardship and struggle. They don't want that. Never have. You're twice dovorced? Either you're blissfully ignorant or a glutton for punishment. Either or, their are those of us who have chosen to cash out and go our own way. Marriage does not benefit men in modern society. The only benefit is the potential to pass on our genes. But please, stay plugged in. Stay blue pill. Without men like you, MGTOW won't have the examples of how truly cucked some of the men slaved to the system are to use as basis for those who see the truth to swallow the red pill.
You're doing the lord's work, fella. Keep at it.
