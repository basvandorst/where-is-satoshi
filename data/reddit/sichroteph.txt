Is it so accurate now ? But you can be sure in a month someone will throw out the graph again after a big bitcoin raise because it will vaguely looks like it. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:53:03
Come on, this graph again ??
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:57:50
Very well written indeed. You are talented with words !
Really hope it will get better and that you will recover. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:37:07
RemindMe! 20 Dec 2018 "BTC AT $100.000"
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:04:28
You forgot the /s
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:24:19
You can map this graph plenty of times in the history of bitcoin and it kept going up. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:14:49
RemindMe! 1 year
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:26:45
They say it’s too late to buy since the bitcoin was worth 500$
Don’t trust experts I loose a shit load of money in panic sell at 3000$ when jp Morgan said it was a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:08:07
Your bank is very generous. I have only 0.5% per year here 
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:02:01
2018 will be a turning point for a lot of things. It’s easy to look like an intellectual with this kind of easy selling sentences. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:12:02
Something like 15 cents. Used electrum, you can preview your transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:08:25
That’s good for bitcoin. The Venezuelan people won’t trust a cryptocurrency made by their government 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:16:13
Thanks for this, very informative 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:22:54
I trust more the paper wallet. Or your private keys stored in an encrypted file under a good password you can remember 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:47:24
The amount of money you have to invest in bitcoins so it can gain 1% is higher and higher. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:48:16
It will eventually worth something valuable. Right now you will loose half of your wallet trying to convert it to $
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:25:39
That’s stupid. When you will convert them to dollars you’ll have to pay the taxes 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:24:23
Still huge losses for him 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:45:20
Just wait and hodl
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:19:15
So they can win a shitload of money for their corrupted actions ?
@_date: 2018-09-21 14:28:36
I don’t have bitcoins anymore, just checking them from time to time 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:20:53
That’s not hard for the gouvernement to track from your money from your non anonymous wallet to your hard wallet .. if you plan to hide it from them you are asking for trouble 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:08:16
100$-&gt;101$ is different that 10000$-&gt;101000$   
It’s a 999 dollars difference 
@_date: 2018-09-22 04:28:12
It’s the 44mm. I like it a lot. I thought it would be too big but it’s thinner too and the big screen is really nice. I think they really nailed it this time. Everything is super fast. Had the series 0 before for a while and I hated it. But after one day I think I’ll keep this one. Try them in an apple store if you can. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:40:33
Posting that on this Reddit sub in like yelling into a delicatessen that you are vegan 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:56:20
Again these tulips .. tulips bulbs can’t  not be divided so at some point nobody could buy them and the demand collapsed. Huge difference with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:33:15
This guy must be paid to make such convinced bs assumptions 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:49:50
All the bitcoin atm were credit card only tho, so it’s not really anonymous 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:18:55
I always hodled you rookie 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:03:05
I am pretty much try sure the bitcoin atm will limit you in the total number you can buy. Or your credit card limit. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:51:49
I want this !!! Can we buy it somewhere ?
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:31:29
That’s kind of the point. Now I know I will be too lazy to create a new account and sell my wallet until it’s worth a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:55:31
Oh I understand your point now. What I was meaning is that there is today a need for much more global cash to make the bitcoin stock raise 1% than one year ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:08:25
Hodl is not a thing. It’s a religion. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:37:09
I am tired of this tulip crisis comparison .. a bulb of tulip is not divisible, just before the crisis 40 bulbs was worth several houses. Nobody could afford that anymore and the bubble exploded. People that compares this and bitcoin trying to look smart are annoying. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:20:18
What cloud? Most of them can time travel in different versions of your wallet so you must be safe 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:54:40
Thanks !!
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:18:24
Palestinians with bitcoins maybe ?
@_date: 2018-09-22 04:29:38
It is. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:48:39
I made a paper wallet for my brother from  and covered in with transparent tape. Looks good. Put 0.003 btc on it (around 30$ at the time now it’s 35$) it’s a pretty fun way to put them into cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2018-09-22 04:33:40
Yes even the .67 looks like it’s rounded. Didn’t know it was a bug. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:32:10
Hurts my eyes and I am French ;)
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:30:33
We have a financial analyst here from saxo bank in Switzerland that said that due to its disruptive technology, it is totally possible in the future that bitcoins represent 5-10% of the total world transactions.        
If that happens then one bitcoin would cost 100k.      
That's my goal actually, I'll hodl until that happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:38:25
In what way ? How can it be competitive against current centralized bank economy with these fees ? Not trying to be sarcastic, I just want to understand. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:14:45
Very interesting thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:34:02
How does it work ? How much do you have to wait until you have your cash ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:12:53
Man that’s sad. Hope these 0.8 lost bitcoins won’t worth millions one day 
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:45:52
Can you explain me this (I am new to this)    
If the mempool is big and fees are high, wouldn't it be more interesting for miners ?
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:36:20
How the system will hold in the future if it gets really popular ? Sorry i am a noob that really want to believe in this currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:34:49
I hold until 1 BTC is 100k. I can wait. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:31:03
that's him :
    
If his prediction is true then a bitcoin would cost 5/1.75*100k = 285k
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:33:58
Bitcoin is not an animal that can bounce back whenever he wants to. If there is a trust issue on bitcoin now there is no chance it will brutally change its mind. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:55:40
99% of the people would. It would be impossible to pay with it for goods which make it almost useless as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:25:16
In bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:11:42
If it's illegal in your country then it is easy for your government/bank to trace your funds and lock you up.

Yes but what is high, and what is low ?
