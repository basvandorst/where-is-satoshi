But what are you creating an image of?  A complete backup image of the phone or are you talking about a literal image of the QR code?  
I no longer have access to the QR codes used to create my GA keys.

Were you able to do this without having a rooted phone?  I've got a N5 and haven't rooted it yet, but I've got all my GA info on it already.

This is an awesome response, thanks!  Had no idea about a lot of these sites.

This is awesome, hadn't seen this before.

What do you buy?

I'm using WooCommere with the Bitcoin Payments extension.  The Bitpay plugin is no good because it doesn't monitor exchange rates which makes it pretty useless.  
I also looked at the BIPS plugin but that GUI is hideous for customers.  Try out the Bitcoin Payments extension for the Woocommerce Wordpress plugin.

Won't the network know about the public key as soon as someone pays him with that address?

You're missing the point.  Neither of your scenarios makes any sense.  In the simplest terms way I can put it, Bitcoin is savings and fiat is checking.  That's it.  If Bitcoin is truly an deflating currency, then it would be stupid to spend it knowing that it will be worth more tomorrow.  
The only reason you would have to every convert Bitcoin to fiat is because Bitcoin is not universally accepted at this point.  Perhaps I should set some parameters on my argument.  
In current conditions, keeping your money in Bitcoin would let you keep more of its value than keeping it in USD.  The only way you could spend your saved Bitcoins at this point is to convert it into the currency of choice because it is not accepted universally or easily by mainstream populace.  
I agree with you, if I could keep everything in Bitcoin and spend in Bitcoin that would probably be the best for my networth.  However, I'm not sure what effect widespread use of a deflationary currency would have on the economy since its nature encourages saving vs spending.  
Which brings us full loop back to my original point.  At this time, assuming increasing use and attention by mainstream to push value up, I am better off keeping my savings in Bitcoin and my checking in local fiat.

Apparently there's an issue with Wordpress cron jobs not running unless someone visits the site.  Do you know how to code this in the Linux cron job?

This is impossible with a finite supply and ever increasing demand, which will happen if Bitcoin ever grows beyond a certain point.

You guys are missing the general point I was trying to make.  I love Bitcoin and everything its about.  I think its brilliant.  
My general point was that instead of choosing one type of currency or the other, we'd be much better served using the two in tandem.   
 I disagree that we are not impacted by inflation deflation.  I'm 30 years old and I can tell you $20 when a WHOLE lot farther in the grocery store in 1993 than it does 20 years later in 2013.  I've tried to save for a long time but you know what?  It is honestly not worth putting my money in a bank to earn 0.90% interest that gets destroyed by 2% inflation every  year.  THAT EQUALS A LOSS.  I can literally buy less this year than I could last year.  
For this reason, more people are forced to enter into more risky investments to try and earn a little more on their money, yourself probably included.  I don't know shit about the stock market and betting against guys that do is not a good bet for me to make money.  I just don't know the rules of the game like they do.  I'd be better off going to Vegas.  
The alternative as I see it, is a deflationary currency which by its nature should increase in value or at the very least keep its value.  I can transfer assets out of that into my local currency as needed. 
I think its stupid to pick one or the other when they serve two very different purposes and the two working in tandem serve my goals much better than one alone.

You answered your own question.  Bitcoin is not at a point that it can easily be used for everyday transactions and until it is, it is simply easier to use local currency.  
I think the short to mid-term goal using Bitcoin would be use in tandem with local currency.  Obviously the end game would be universal use.  
I understand your point though and agree.  We're just not there yet.
