I have a different view.
What you said is true, and fewer people are using bitcoin, but this sharp decrease must be due to something else.
First of all, most of newcomers were stucked on exchanges, not actually interacting with the blockchain.
Second, the number of transactions added to the mempool everyday hasn't changed.

Everything I read points in this direction.
But this is what blocks me:
The initial investment : if you invest in crypto you always have the option to get out and recover at least partially, when you buy miners you are down for that sum and you have to wait for ROI. If crypto dies or changes mining you're in trouble..
I think you didn't factor in the need for a power line capable of that wattage. I think only one or two can be run from a normal household power line.

1 -Block size with segwit is already comparable to a 2-4MB block.
Do you really think only 2MB will be sufficient? for how much?
Mining is already centralized? I don't think so... If you really think something like that, why are you in crypto? Centralization is the death of crypto. If I believed a thing like that I would be out in a second and I would be warning everybody...
2 - No sarcasm, I tried to sound entusiast not to scare you with my follwoing sentence, because I would really want to read something like this. It's my investment and money we're talking about and this would be a huge game changer.. If you have sources, please help me out here.

That might be true for the first world, where we actually use bitcoin as speculative asset and a "paypal-less" paypal...
But that's not where Bitcoin is actually needed.
Think of Nigeria for example or Zimbabwe or Venezuela..
Try to think what makes Bitcoin special...
Bitcoin allows people to create their own money and let the market decide what is worth.. 
If Bitcoin was 10 years older, maybe Venezuelans could have fought better the incredible svalutation the State imposed on the national currency.
They could have had part of their savings in Crypto unaffected by the svalutation on the national caused by some head of state who thought to print more money to cover expenditures...
Let me be clear: the USD serves this purpose right now. 
In regions where sovereign money is not to be trusted, USD is preferred as it is more stable, but it can be very hard to get and overpriced.
On top of that, in addition to "banking the unbanked" we can actually start to "debank" all of us..
(we can all have access to banking an financial services, without having to rely to a third party for verification and trust)

What happened?
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:14:04
I think the hard fork needed is the main reason why not...
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:25:20
Consensus has to be reached on the changes, being them in the process of node creation or blockchain validation, or else...
Fork is when from a software product, you start a branch and let it live on it's own with independent development and progress from the main trunk.
Hard is when the fork is not backward compatible with the main branch
While soft fork would work with the current branch, hard fork require creating a whole new currency, that need to get it's value from the market.
Segwit is a soft fork, Bitcoin cash is an hard fork both aimed at increasing the maximum number of transactions per block with different approaches.
Hard fork require everyone, both miners and nodes to change their software.
(Note: hard and soft referes to software updates, independently from the ASIC used. For example, BCASH uses the same ASIC as "legacy" bitcoin, while Segwit breaks ASIC accelleration techniques)
In case of a community with great cohesion and consensus, forks (even hard forks) can be easy and move "immediately" from the old to the new(E.g. Monero upgrades), in other cases new forks can simply become a new currency with its own following (E.g. Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash)
Every project mantains the feature list and usually open source code to be reviewed by whoever wants to check/comment or add to the project.
For example:

Depends on you..
What are you here for? 
The gainz? the principle?
You should only remain in Antpool if you are here for the gains and the decreased income for losing fees is justified by the larger hashing power share they have right now.
You should leave Antpool if you're here for the principles or you're here for the gains and calculate you would earn more with a pool who takes fees....

I think you only need to know that the BCASH fork occurred on 1st 
August 2017. IF you didn't hold anything by then, you don't have anything to claim.
But anyway...
Bitcoin has a ledger where all transactions and balances are mantained.
At the moment of the fork, that ledger is copied and from that block on, they continue on different roads, meaning that whatever you do on any of the two ledgers after the fork won't affect the other one (Some forks do not implement double spending prevention, google each fork about it).
The same transactions and balances at the moment of the fork are on both ledgers.
So, if you have access (private keys) to a bitcoin address with a certain amount on the ledger at the moment of the fork you come to posses the same amount of the new currencies.
If you had 1,2 BTC, now you have 1,2 BCASH.
The value of the new currency is given and driven by market. at the moment BCASH is 2000 something USD.
Some exchanges give you your private keys (hoping they don't hold a copy.
Some implements direct connections to hardware wallets.
Others like Coinbase/GDAX don't give you access to your private keys (meaning you don't own the actual coins, but only "tokens" of that platform that are then """converted""" to actual coins when you wuthdraw).
In case of big/meaningful forks some exchanges like Coinbase/GDAX decide to implement and release the forked coins to their customers.

I would agree with the idea, if you were talking about global crypto market cap.
I'm but a newb at this, but right now I think most are moving to altcoins to find a new "millionaire" game, this woudl slow down Bitcoin at least for 4-5 months IMHO, until Global Market cap reach 1,5/2Trillions or so, then we probably will see a real "crash" in the crypto world well below 1Trillion and in that moment most of the funds moved into alts will possibly move back into Bitcoin or in alternative a new King might be crowned during the disarray..

You were literally defending BCASH over the whole thread and this conversation we're having is about that.. lol...
Why this doesn't surprise me?
Why shilling BCASH when there's plenty of alts without fees or with lower fees?
And if you're in for the money, why BCASH? currently the 4th by market cap... Even if it had an interesting proposition to grant it a future, how much can it grow? BCASH is not for gainz.
Lots of alts with lower or no fees with brilliant plans and ideas could

I read it :D
You usually find it on the top of the page in website to monitor the market like coinmarketcap or livecoinwatch.
Coinmarketcap has a graph of global market cap with and without bitcoin (just click on the amount of global market cap on the top of the page.
If you were asking how is it calculated then, it's the sum of all singular coins market cap.
Singular market cap are calculated by multiplying Average price * Circulating supply.
That's why having a skewed price would yield a skewed market cap
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:37:36
Well the names would be up to consensus to decide, Ethereum decided to call the old one "classic" and keep up with the other one.
Everyone owning Bitcoin (the private keys) at the moment of the fork, would have the same amount of both currencies and consensus would drive funds from the old to the new, since the old one is going to be abandoned and the new one would be adopted, new traders and buyers woudl go to the new one.

Fork is when from a software product, you start a branch and let it live on it's own with independent development and progress from the main trunk.
Altcoins were born either as fork of Bitcoin (litecoin, Bitcoin cash, etc..) or completely independent projects born now that we know decentralized trust is possible and we try to improve on the technology (ethereum, iota, cardamo..)
Anybody can take the code modify and release it as a new currency.
(We are talking about hard forks, soft forks like Segwit are backward compatible with the main project and don't require moving to a different currency)
No real way to effectively track all forks, but in the top right corner of the Bitcoin project page on github you can see how many people have forked it through github. Please notw that some those forks could have resulted in effective currencies or just died on some dev pc as experiments. While effective forks may have not been done through github.

From the user POV (shortsighted):
GDAX/Coinbase is still one of the most usable and user friendly way to trade in crypto.
From the community POV :
Fuck them! 
Not because of problems in customer support.. (any business facing a surge like this would have problems, Google and Niantic couldn't manage PokemonGO for months)
Not because their CEO is openely against Bitcoin Core, 
but because he uses his position to drive the market.
Right now we know GDAX/CoinBase is spamming the network with unbatched transactions, and there's the strong possibility (I, as many others, am sure of it, but I will allow the benefit of doubt) that they are single handedly keeping the current state of mempool and fees. If they would implement JUST TX BATCHING, I estimated less than 2 weeks for the mempool to empty out and fees to get back to acceptable ranges.

Nope... you wanna know why?
All the reasons you're thinking of, are not the reasons iphone had that success.
**Iphone was SIMPLE**
All functionalities and apps were self contained in icons, no drawer/home page links, and provided all the access to the modern technology that non-tech-savy people felt they were missing out. This came during a race to the functionality that, trying to offer more functionalities and power to the user, actually put him in conditions where he felt disoriented and usually intimidated by long, obscure menus most of them was totally unused... (the whole society pivoted around the iphone, from a race toward features, to a race toward usability and simplicity )
**Iphone was nice to use**
As a Linux fanboy, I never suffered closed projects, and Apple even more so because they were selling their pc/ipods on a premium just for "style".
Android was born during these days and my hype was enormous about it...
But then I got an iphone 3G in my hands in the first months of 2009.
You can't understand how using an iphone (especially scrolling) felt to someone coming from ages of Nokia/Siemens/etc..
Less than 12 hours later I was ordering one online on ebay.
Ok, I got it at a very convenient price because the seller thought to be scamming me, (sending an iphone with a broken (glued) silence button, but Apple replaced the whole phone for this since it was a design flaw) but I think that I would have given in even at an higher price.
I feel like I owned a piece of history. 
In my eyes, the launch of the iphone is the event that actually opened the way for older people (In 2008, I suppose less than 5% of people over 40 actually used pc or any other tech for anything else than work) and the non tech-savy ones to the world of internet, social network, streaming, etc...
I see the iphone launch as being of the same importance as the 1st PC, the open internet and blockchains. I don't know if it will be given this importance in the annals of history, but I can tell you iphone single handledly changed the way we look at tech and accelerated tech diffusion by at least one generation
THE WHOLE PHILOSOPHY of the iphone was to be nice to use.
It missed critical functionalities for years, because the dev team felt they couldn't implement them without hinder the simplicity in use or the performances.
PS: If you say it robbed them from other Apple products like the ipod and such, I think you might consider changing the phrasing on your comment

@_date: 2018-01-07 06:06:10


Well.... isn't that a silly sentence? 
let's talk about it:
I would not consider which alt coin you're into(they can go up and down), but let's say you move back your money into Bitcoin.
**1st** If you get into Bitcoin right now (17K), and it explodes to let's say 21K, what is your actual gain?
It's around 23%.
If you have "10" invested at 17K, that would be "12,3"
**2nd** you have to consider buying/selling/transfer fees, depending on your exchange (some charge more, some doesn't) and amount of money invested (some fee are fixed not a percentage) it could be more than the actual gain
**3rd** Bitcoin vs altcoins:  larger market cap means slower movements, slower gains, slower losses. 23% gain/loss is huge for Bitcoin and it requires time, while for other altcoins it can be a matter of hours or minutes to spin form a +40% to a -40%.
Independently to the coin you're invested into, your gains and losses are all in percent of your investement.
If you bought "10" of QTUM yesterday, you would had 15 now.
**TL;DR:** It's not silly to want back into Bitcoin, but it's a conservative strategy to invest in the most secure asset on the market. It's a move to be more sure of avoiding big losses, but also big rapid gains.
Don't get me wrong, Bitcoin should be 30 to 70% of your investment, to have a solid base on which you can rely, but if you're talking about gains, gains, gains,  17k-&gt;21K is a little change.

And if you read my comment that's what I said. Just not when it would mean a centralization of mining.




I've never heard of this! this is HUGE!!! Please give more to read about this!
The only thing related to this I heard is that when they say LN could support up to X transaction, they mean when the block size will be Y. Implementing LN right now would provide incredible improvement but not at the level of the maximum reachable.


Well that's not true... And you talk like you don't even take into consideration the very comment you're replying to
1MB block size right now will keep things decentralized.
 
Increasing the block size without the required technological advance will just create a situation where only VERY big organizations can actually sustain the costs of the massive datacenter needed for mining.

1MB block size was introduced by satoshi bundled into other updates without even informing the other devs.
I don't know the exact calculation involved and I suspect was a design choice made by a mixture of benchmarking and estimation of technology progress
The actual goal for that limit is to avoid the computation to become unreachable by common users. A bigger block size requires more computational power and with the current state of technology only very big companies could afford the datacenter necessary for that, effectively breaking the main goal of Bitcoin: decentralization.
In a few years is probable the block size users will be able to process will be bigger, hence the consensus could move toward an increase in block size.
That said: if you really are new and you are doing your research, why this focus on a controversial upgrade and not on currently available and working solutions?

Your affirmation, while it might have some truth in it, was out of place.
This art piece is to symbolize the first time society found a way to decentralize trust.
It's like hanging a picture of the first Macintosh Personal Computer.
It's obviously outdated, but it's what it means that matters.
When you came here saying that, you sounded like someone who could be either:
- trying to discredit the value of this frame piece (discrediting the actual technical implementation of the white paper won't affect the idea and therefore what the frame represents)
- trying to inflame a discussion about adherence on white paper and altcoins (as you know, this sub is pretty adamant about this)
- someone so pendant or so eager to show off that you're being so fixated on telling other their mistake that you end up missing the bigger picture
- missing the whole point of evolution and progress in technology, saying that "we don't believe in the original white paper anymore" is like saying we don't believe in personal computer anymore. YES WE DO! Most of the white paper still is the bible to describe what and how it happens, we just updated some very few concepts to adapt, improve, overcome.. It's like saying the first PC was all wrong and we don't believe in that way of building PC because it used Floppy disks. Little changes after little changes PC became our companions and had tablets and smartphone as their offsprings, but we never said, we don't believe in building PC as Motherboard/RAM/HDD/CPU/IO...

Miners are on the "operative side" of the blockchain, but regarding software and software development they are on the "user side".
They just get the new version of software "BITCOIN MINER 0.9.3.2_forkB" and they decide to operate one or the other based on the features reported by developers.
The problem is... nowadays this operations is executed at hardware level (ASIC as basically pc built only for one task, in this case compute sha256 hashes) so miners would have to see if the current mining hardware woudl be compatible with the fork, even with a software update, or if they would have to change their hardware.
This is what happened with Segwit, Segwit is a soft fork, meaning it's backward compatible with legacy bitcoin nodes, but the actual operation to compute new blocks is different so many accelaration techniques for ASICs don't work anymore.
That's why you have a slow and largely opposed adoption of segwit: miners are opposing it through consensus.
@_date: 2018-01-20 09:16:07
Hi man! 
Yes you are right.
You are trusting the company producing your hardware wallet.
But not because it can go under, but because you trust them to not have backdoors/exploits in place to get to your keys. (In addition to having developed a secure solution that cannot be broken)
It must be said that their whole business is based on this and I myself trust them.
There are techniques to safely store your keys without having to rely on a third party.
You can start looking for paper wallet, air gaps and offline transaction signing.
Basically.... you want to protect your keys. You don't want to expose in any way your keys to the network or to a pc that has been on a network (and could therefore be infected)
Hardware wallet keep the keys on your hardware Waller and sign tx on the device (not sure about the signinig), never letting the pc you're interacting with have access to them. This implies you can use whatever pc to manage your funds because the hw will protect your keys.
You can do this de-coupling of keys from the pc you use to sync with the blockchain yourself with air gaps.
**Air gap** means you use 2 different pc.
One with a new installation of a trusted OS that has never been and will never be connected to a network and one normal pc connected to the network that you will use to sync with the blockchain.
On the offline pc you will use your keys and you will sign transactions.
Then you will put the signed tx on an USB key and bring it to the connected pc to sync.
"Air gap" refers to the actual physical barrier between these two pc that will never be connected by a network.
**Paper wallet** are wallets where you store the keys only on paper, eliminating the risk of a cyber attack. They can be used alternatively or in addition to air gaps..

That would an acceptable attitude toward a useless thing, but we are now talking about something that is less than useless, it is harmful!
If your position toward something that is harmful is "I can never change this, let's just tune out and accept it"
Well, I think that's part of the problem... 
Think if Satoshi thought that about the Banking system.. where would we be today?
IF you see something wrong and harmful, go out and try to change it! I'm probably not the best person to do this, and  probably I canned my whole post driven by my emotions, but I'm trying!

So you convenientely don't even take into consideration my reply and move on with trolling?
Ok i'll take it as you recognized I was in the reason!




WUT? 


1. By parameters I take you are talking about block size, hashing function, block time and such? 
    Do you understand how little value can be added by changing a parameter?
    Litecoin, BCASH, etc... they all are GEN1 cryptos that are just bad copies of BItcoin and they are certainly destined to die, as Bitcoin future itself is not clear right now.
   You should reeeeeaaally look into second and third gen cryptos if you want to make money. Those are REAL alts, they didn't change some parameters, they built a whole new service for other use-cases
2. Bitcoin is not strong because it is "time tested", litecoin is time tested, dogecoin is time tested...
   Bitcoin sustained/survived attack of every sort, from constant media discredit to the BCASH community actively trying to shill BCASH and discredit BItcoin, with tactics so low that is almost a joke... It survived Mt. Gox and others critical phases, such as the recent network spamming.


What do you mean?
Do you have invested in both BCASH and BITCOIN? Do you understand they are not complementary and they actually are in contrast so the life of one will probably mean the death of the other?
It's not about being maximalist, you don't understand the concept of exclusivity, they are not complementary services, they are competing services. 
And they are not in a "let's grow together" maket like buying shares of AT&amp;T and VERIZON could be.
They are in a rising new market where there's still to identify the current vision for the future and gain for one will probably means loos fo the other.
It's not being maximalist to take a stance, to choose between two sides, to read whitepapers, check current project status, monitor the communities monitor the market and draw conclusions.

The point of discussion is that if your only concern is low fees, you should stick with FIAT, that at the current moment has a better infrastructure and offers lower or absent fees for normal transactions.
Crypto is not about lower fees, crypto is about power over assets and transaction.
All this aside the fact that BCASH is an irrational move from a developing standpoint, (like adding 4 lanes to an 2 lanes highway where you think traffic will increase 10x every year), and promote centralization.

Changing the block size would require a process called hard fork.
Fork is when from a software product, you start a branch and let it live on it's own with independent development and progress from the main trunk.
Hard is when the fork is not backward compatible with the main branch..
While soft fork would work with the current branch, hard fork require creating a new currency, that need to get it's value from the market.
Segwit is a soft fork, Bitcoin cash is an hard fork both aimed at increasing the maximum number of transactions per block with different approaches

Well... first of all, I wasn't replying on that line, but simply stating that Bitcoin situation is temporary, and could have been avoided.
I'm willing to take up the challenge and try to give you a dignified reply to your legitimate question.
There are a so many things Bitcoin and current alternative cryptocurrencies can do that current FIAT system don't allow that **I will just focus on the core concept, to explain its disruptive nature.**
One of ***the most innovative aspect of this technology is decentralization of trust, replacing the current systems based on trust on a central authority.***
Sending money through VISA/Bank, both ends rely to the banking system to verify the sender has the funds, the recipient has a working receiving account and obtains the funds in due time.
In cryptocurrencies, you don't have to trust anyone, you can just freely record a transaction on that technology, just by broadcasting that transaction.
And in the case of Bitcoin, **that means the ability to transfers any amount of funds anytime, anywhere**, independently to the current situation in any country and their situation with their state authority, **without any possibility for anyone to block, freeze or control that funds or transfer.**
In case of different altcoins there are so many uses and possibilities I cannot even begin to explain how much can be done.. Imagine that you can do what bitcoin does, with everything that can be digital (certificates, programs, contracts, data, etc..), in various other ways (different blockchains, holochains, tangles,hashgraphs,etc..) with various specific use cases and advantages (some are fasters, some are specifically for crypto based loans, some work with smart contracts, some provide turing complete programming languages to develop on their chain...
- That said, I'm willing to acknowledge that currently **to someone living in a first world country, Bitcoin feels just something like a Bank wire, Visa or Paypal,** that works without a Paypal in between and at the moment *Bitcoin* is now even slower and pricier than other services for certain use cases (while still superior for others and other coins can compensate the deficiencies).
- (Just as example) Paypal is active only in 19 countries
- Almost half of the world population doesn't have access to ANY KIND of banking and financial service, while many others have huge problems (think what a Crypto based loans service could do, etc..)
- Oppressive government can monitor, freeze or size any funds of anybody, as well as monitor and deny access to banking services, some do just of suspicions.
- Most of the world currencies is not stable or reliable, even with its volatility, Bitcoin is better than currencies in countries with unstable government and economy.

We're facing a bottleneck due in part to technological limits and in part to lack of consensus on available solutions.
Lack if adoption of segwit, that breaks some mining accelerating techniques, is the main reason Bitcoin cannot sustain the current needs.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:04:21
You are right in saying that the consensus will define which currency have which value.
But please consider the possibility to read a little more about the project and its goals.
It will probably come the day when Core will have to mess with block size or find a better solution than segwit(considering that reaching a 50% segwit adoption right now fees would be low and tx queues would be empty), but that won't happen before the changes would be sustainable by distributed mining pools, and most importantly it won't happen if the result is linear with the increase. Solutions like Segwit and layer2+ networks allow a scaling that is more sustainable and allow exponential gains to accommodate possible future scaling walls, instead of having to linearly gain from adding more size to the block.
BCH is controlled and already under a 51% dominance.
To give an example... 
Take the telegraph... 1 line, 1 communication allowed, limited to the human response time.
WE NEED TO SEND MORE DATA!
So.. 
BCASH approach is like putting many telegraph line one next to the other, this would surely work, but only very important and rich people would have the possibility to send to much information at that speed and they would effectively manage and monopoly all communication systems.
Core approach is like trying to find a way to improve over the current technology, instead of replicating..
Maybe let machine record/send messages, this would allow a faster communication that probably wouldn't compete with 10 or 100 lines in parallel since people would still be needed to read and input a reply. But after that, we all know, we ended up developing the internet, and everything you are using right now is built from the basic principle to let current run along a copper wire (this still is layer 1 of the ISO/OSI network stack).
So... what do you want to do? more telegraphs or we aim for the internet?

The highilighted part is that in order to aquire new assets, they didn't use money they owned.  
They printed new.  
Effectively, the people/nation using that currency have all contributed to this purchase with a fraction of the value of the money they own as "its whole value as a currency has been diluted in more printed bills".  
\&gt; It's literally their job to "create money out of thin air"   
Indeed, but you would expect this to be extremely regulated and that they act by request of states that plan and compensate for this new printed bills, not that the central bank print what they need when they want.

No one wants to debate BTCvsBCH here.  
There are no linguistic to appeal to.

My god the bias..  
If you write an article to find problems you will find them: "Bitcoin wallets cannot be operated by thought" (yet)  
Banks stop any movement abroad, the writer says Bitcoin can't be the alternatives because (in order as presented in the article):
1. people don't have money 
2. internet access is expensive 
3. electricity and internet are not always running 
4. Lebanese banks are greylisted
5. People are not tech savy  
1 - precludes you from ***needing*** the service  
2, 3 - But it works... Banks deny you that service, you can have it in a rioting country thanks to a distributed system.  
4 - That's a limitation from the banks not Bitcoin,and in any case there are ways around that.  
5 - So... in 2008 you would critique smartphones saying people aren't  ready for that? People who have a need will orginize. Just look what happened to all seniors when they realized they could see pics of their granchildren on smartphones and socials..
Concludes with "*Despite all these hurdles, the anonymous trader is still advising Lebanese friends to find a way to buy bitcoin as they warily eye the threat of stricter capital controls on the horizon. Askar is even more optimistic about bitcoin’s prospects in Lebanon*"

I'm trying an ELI5 on this..
Basically.. nothing in this world has value except how much you are willing to give for it.
A pc may be worth $1000, 2 tablets, or 4000 socks
The BIG question is: "Are you okay if I give you this in exchange for that?"
Money is just a way to exchange between goods:I have 4000 socks, and I want your pc, but you don't want my socks, you want 2 tablets.  
I give my 4000 socks to someone who wants them at $0.25 each, now I can give you $1000 and with that you can get your 2 tablets.
"Price" means "value in terms of the interexchange good we call money" and money has a specific value that changes in time even if we don't think about it since we are used to think in terms of money as "absolute value",[it isn't]( the amount of things you can exchange for the same amount of money descrease over time in a process called inflation (\*)
Bitcoin existed without any kind of value until someone decided to exchange something of a defined value for some bitcoin. (One of the first was Laszlo Hanyecz on 22 May 2010, who gave 10.000 bitcoin in exchange for 2 pizzas, effectively setting an exchange value for bitcoin, however low it was. )
Exchanges started to pop up and bitcoin were put on sale at a very low "price" (value expressed in money units)
People looking into the tech were impressed and wanted to have more bitcoin for themselves, and gradually, the amount of value the people were ready to exchange for bitcoin started to rise, since there was less and less people ready to give out their bitcoin for lower value.
Ok, maybe ELI10
(\*)The fact this process is highly influencable by governments \[and big banks\], who can deliberately print more money to pay their debts, effectively spreading the value of the whole currency along more printed bills, taxing people out of their pockets without even touching their money, is one of the biggest reason Bitcoin started in the first place.

Apart from the obvious doubts about the extent of stress this would put on the technological side, 
I think the less we inflate the bubble, and the more we can achieve sustainable growth, the more we are all going to profit from this in the future.
Bubbles cause panics, the worng panic of the wrong amount of people at the worng moment can mean death for a project so young and so distant from commonly accepted goods.

I mean... let's try and make that into a more factual sentence..
*Without any solution in place to allow for more, faster and cheaper transactions, if the volume keeps increasing as it is, we are going to face higher fees and slower transactions that could be an obstacle to the adoption of bitcoin as a mean of payment.(i.e. it would work well as a store of value)*
There are various solutions to these worries, one is increasing the block size, BCH did that.
Segwit and Lightning Network are other solutions to the same problem and they don't require a fork, BTC went that way

Copper oxidize, silver does it too and in addition to that it does suffer from migration in active electrical circuits.
That's why when we want or can't do without the highest quality conductors, we look at gold. (Think at NASA)  
  
That said...
I do agree electrical conductivity is not the reason gold became valuable.  
there are many factors that concurred in making gold valuable and later lead to it becoming one of the first types of money:  
\- It's stable (it doesn't decay, oxidize, it's water resistent... etc..)
\- It's easy to work (you can spread or stretch it without cracking)
\- It's relatively scarse  
But I don't see these as "reasons" to why it became valuable, but more as "prerequisites", the main reason it's very likely that **Gold is Beautiful**.   
Even if I don't personally like the color, you have to admit that in ancient time gold glitter would have been  one of the most amazing thing ever (I'm thinking Roman/Greek era, where even blue was rare to see)
And as usual, things get to be valuable because we assign that value to them. If the gold color was something closer to brown/greenish or anything else that could make it unsightful, it would not have had the same role in our history and economy.
@_date: 2019-04-23 01:07:17
Yeah man, you missed the point.
I was talking about man made objects.
Blue has always been one of the hardest pigments to recreate, mostly because there is no blue pigment in living nature, there's only a rare butterfly that has a very light shade of blue pigment, all other blues you find in living organisms are made by phisical arrangements of microscopic structures rather that actual molecules of blue pigments and would therefore not being suitable for use as a pigment. (once you grind those, or even only wet them, they lose their color)
While there were some sort of blue pigment derived from sediments, they tended to tend toward shades of green or black, it's not until the 5-7 century AC when Persians strated grinding Lapis Lazuli into what is known as Ultramarine that we saw TRUE blue in human made objects.
And even then, it always was something uncommon and usually reserved for the most important pieces (e.g. The virgin Mary robes were almost always depicted as blue or light blue, to further signify her sanctity)
**Edit:** Lol, sorry if I vomited this wall of text on you, but now you see what I meant: in a world where even getting a blue pigment was rare, having a metal that shines and glitters, without ever oxidizing while being extremely easy to work, must have been amazing!
**PS:** Out of curiosity, can you cite some of those trees that put out blue leaves? I know about the Peacock Begonia, but that's it...
**Fun fact**: Blue is also one of the last colors to be assigned a word in the development of a language, and this is part related to our difficulty in replicating it. 
Without asssigning a word to "mentally categorize it", we lack the tools to even recognize it.
A GREAT experiment is one conducted on this Namibian tribe that has no word for Blue but a shit ton of words for every shade of green.
When they were put in front of green squares all of the same shade and one very slightly different, and asked to find the intruder of the group they could without a problem, but when put in front of various shades of green and a blue square and were asked to pick the intruder, they couldn't identify which one. 
Exactly the opposite that would happen to one of us.
This were the pictures:
And yes there is a slightly different shade of green in there. We just don't have the mental tools to identify it.

Ok, before moving onto calculation of profits, one of the first steps to start investing is to learn to differentiate between raise in value and percentage.
I am sure many of the people who abrutely dismissed you, know how it works, but don't actually have it at heath and don't immediately perceive a 15K-&gt;17K raise exactly as an 7.5k-&gt;8.5K, that would take their 100$ to 113$ in both cases..
First of all your entry price is not the one you read on the graph but the one you get as 
**ENTRY POINT = ($ invested) / (BTC obtained)**
in your case
**ENTRY POINT =** 600 / 0.077=~ **7,792.21**
In any moment you know that your BTC value in USD is equal to 
**VALUE OF BTC  = (Amount of BTC) * (Price of BTC)**
So if the target price is 10,000, the projected value is
**VALUE OF BTC (at 10k)  =** 0.077 * 10,000 = **770€**
total gain = 770-600 = 170€ = **28.3%** of 600€
price variation = 10,000-7,792.21 = 2207.79 = **28.3%** of 7,792.21
value now / value then = price now / price then
600 : (???) = 7,792.21 : 10,000
(???) = 600 * 10,000 / 7,792.21
What the actual fuck!
I managed to take a simple topic and turn it into a monstrosity
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:32:23
I don't know if I actually make it easier to understand \^\^"
However at the moment, maybe it was the case to calculate the loss at a projected value!
Are you ready for the worst case scenario?
Bitcoin is going down right now and in the worst case it can go as low as 3,5K-4K..
Are you ready for that?
0.077 * 4,000 = 308$

I thing you are trying to push your narrative without even grasping the actual point made.


You are fixating on "pizza", while I'm saying "real world value".
Without anyone starting to exchange BTC for "something", it would not have started.
This first attribution of value has to be made by someone with no actual economic interest in that first exchange.
I seriously doubt someone who's operating only out of personal gain and legal issues for it as "money laundering" or "drug trafficking" would be willing to give drugs or money in exchange for something that to that point had no value.

Doesn't look bad imho for the moment...
There will come a time where you can directly send them to Amazon...  
Edit: now that I think about it, that's exactly what happens with payments processors like Paypal...  
So very similar to the current situation.

Let's be real, without someone to actually do this, Bitcoin would never have started have a real world value.

As I understand it, you see this as a bad omen.
As per my current understanding, this means Bitcoin is currently overvalued.
This could either mean investors are expecting an higher return than the current situation can provide or that we are seeing speculative or dumb money pouring in.  
Stock crash, can have something to do with this too..  
What is your take on this?

Have you at least read the comment you're replying to?

When I said "I seriously doubt" it's because if I stated that as an absolute fact you could have replied that in a very extreme and highly improbable situation people trying to find a way to exchange value without FIAT could have invested in those first wortheless exchanges aiming for a global attribution of value (or at least local to their community). Nothing is ever 100% sure in this world.  
I'm sorry, I lost track of the conversation in my previous reply.  
My reply was that I didn't understand your objection to my "without someone committed to exchange something for a then worthless BTC it would not have started" but it seems like the misunderstanding was in "pizza vs real world value/something". anybody other than him and/or after him could have done it.  
When I talked about a narrative is because even in that case, you could have replied with any other exchange more probable to happen than a one happening in a risky and for profit trade, and it struck me as someone who wanted to push the narrative of the early use of Bitcoin for illecit trafficks more than an actual objection to my point.
