He is buying 1 btc for 16.7k and then selling 1 bitcoin he doesnt have next month for $17550.
If price stays the same ($16,700 he gains $850 because he sold a bitcoin at $17,550.)
If the price goes to $17550 his bitcoin gains $850 in value and he loses nothing on his short.
If the price goes up to $17,700 his bitcoin gains $1000 in value and he loses $150 on his short.
Pretty much regardless of what he does he gains $850 a month.

It doesn't make sense to me either. Seems very very fishy.

Quick research shows its pretty much a usb drive with the private key for certain amount of bitcoins. You get the opendime put bitcoin on it then can trade it as a physical currency.

If annual bitcoin returns are &gt;15.9% than it is worth it. And ive had 15.9% returns this week.

I feel like I should have told people $10,000 isnt the end of the world for me and I am quite lucky in that aspect

I knew I could make the minimum payment regardless of what happened to bitcoin, so it wouldnt be the end of the world. Btc is a small portion of my investments.
If bitcoin started going down i was stop lose at $9200 so i would have just taken a little hit. After ut started going up 10% i just decided to HODL until I got here.
