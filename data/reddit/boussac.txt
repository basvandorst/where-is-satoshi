Read what is posted before writing. Where did davout suggest more regulation ?? He is only pointing at some areas of concerns for any European customer of a trading platform.

This is huge: showroomprive is one of the top 10 e-commerce sites in France

What you are missing is the fact that the pooled bank account is a corporate account (belonging to Kraken) not a separate account held by the bank (Fidor is not the account holder).
That is forbidden by European regulation.
If Fidor was the account holder they would have to perform the same kyc due diligence before opening an account as Lemon way does for Bitcoin-central.
Therefore you should expect kraken, bitstamp and btc-e to go belly up sooner or later for the same reason. They will have their bank accounts frozen and your funds with  it if you were careless emough to leave any funds with them. Only Bicoin-central and bitcoin.de are compliant in Europe afaik.

If you believe that Bitcoin-central or Paymium have a say in you opening a payment account with our banking partner (Lemon Way), you are wrong. Account verification is performed exclusively by our banking partner.
I realize that you can be mislead by two factors
1. you are using our web site to upload your documents but we do not even have access to them. Only our banking partner is reviewing them. Its clearly stated in our FAQ and ToS but you probably did not care to read those.
2. most other exchanges such as Bitstamp do account verification only to protect themselves against fraud. We work with a Payment Institution to protect our customers from having their  funds frozen.I would like to remind you that it is illegal for a European company to open a payment account unless the company is a licensed Payment Institution. Bitstamp is not a Payment Institution to my knowledge.
I can assure you however that our banking partner does not discriminate against Greek applicants as is testified by the healthy number of bitcoin-central verified accounts held by Greek citizens.

Interesting. However OP misses the point about R3 permissioned blockchain: its a consortium therefore, only one node with 42 instances. Certainly does not deserve a score of 22 but 1 instead imho (permissioned blockchain = 51% attack is successfull and sustained).

That's a lame, dumb, doomed theft attempt +DoS: the guy is accepting tips ??

Bitcoin-central.net is accepting deposits in Euro or GBP via wire transfer.
Because the UK is in the SEPA zone, those wire transfer deposits are free of charge (if no currency conversion occurs)
For GBP make sure to use Paymium's correct IBAN number.

Try bitcoin-central.net
They are now accepting GBP deposits by wire transfer at no charge (UK being in the SEPA zone).

It's good to see bitcoin-central becoming a multi-currency market place for bitcoiners. Davout has done such a great job already to facilitate bitcoin/euros trading.
