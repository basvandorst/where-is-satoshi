I think most readers missed them too, since there are none in .


This sounds like an admirable goal, but your methods are clearly counter-productive. By posting serious criticism to you're associating it with sociopathic and adverserial content, so the people you're trying to save will react emotionally and ignore it.
* Singling out individuals who make mistakes makes it harder for them to admit mistakes, because it associates identity with belief.
* Giving a group a name ("buttcoiners") increases group-think (on both sides!)
* Sociopathic behaviour (sending tips to burn addresses) makes the sub adversarial instead of engaging.
* Ignoring falsehoods in anti-bitcoin comments (or downvoting correction) ruins reputation.
* Associating Bitcoin with an ideology (libertarianism) encourages it to be discussed in these terms and encourages confirmation bias.
I think if you were serious about saving people from losses, you would find a different channel and a friendlier, more engaging tone to communicate your concerns. Of course, if your goal is just *shadenfreude*, I have no doubt that there's plenty of "comedy gold" to come.

Think of an example of a great idea. It can be any great idea, a story, a solution to a problem, a song or a poem. It might be *the scientific method*, *the golden rule*, *Cinderella* or *Happy Birthday to you*. Now imagine you could sell pieces of this idea in such a way that ownership was always clear and indisputable. That's basically what a cryptocurrency does.
Now add the ability to exchange bits of your idea via the Internet quickly and easily. Add a hundred online exchanges, add hundreds of apps, add retaillers across the world, news articles and publicity.
If the person you're talking to still thinks bitcoin has absolutely **zero value**, go and talk to someone with a brain instead. If they think it's *overvalued*, that's a whole different argument.

from the expert.
Do you seriously spend ALL DAY spreading FUD about bitcoin? Is it really all you have to do?
@_date: 2014-01-17 09:56:59
Just some quick points:


claimed he could send money *for free* to a *phone number*, then backed out. At least twice. Then deleted his posts. Although [Bitcoin had already been sent to him](


Only to [some parts of the world]( It's cheaper with Bitcoin.


Any data set which shows this also shows that Bitcoins's value *increases* by 2% every day. Either there is insufficient data to say that volatility is high, or there is sufficient data to say that it's a good store of wealth. You have to cherry-pick to see just one half of this argument.


I've studied it at university level. More than your ["total lack of education in economics."](


Blockchain only reports Bitcoin transactions, but they're [rising anyway]( if you use the site correctly. See also [dogecoin volume](


Bitcoin is still in Early-adopter phase. How many EFTPOS transactions were there five years after its invention? How quickly can EFTPOS potentially grow in developing economies?


EFTPOS is no good for person-to-person or internet-only transactions. It's not decentralized, it's not cheap, and you have to trust the merchant with your identity. If you'd read the *replies* to sqig, you would have seen all this by now.
 
Please go and read the faq, watch some [Bitcoin Blackboard Videos]( or make a minimal effort before you think you know more than people who've been answering these arguments for years.
@_date: 2014-03-31 07:56:11
Yes, that's exactly what I was asking about. Do you have specifics?
@_date: 2014-01-08 08:05:40
sqig has actually evolved his argument slightly, I suspect he's mostly just playing troll to learn more. The unfortunate truth is that lying outrageously is more likely to get someone to explain something to you than asking politely.
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:02:44
Yes, the genesis block is probably the most accurate mapping. The important things are is that it's 
1. Widely-known and valuable
2. An abstract thing with no physical substance
But if you're going to tell the genesis block as a bedtime story for your kids, or sing it karaoke, dont expect applaus.
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:08:27
It may in fact be the exact opposite of Satoshi's prediction: if ghash continues it's brazen abuse of bitcoin, the value of bitcoin will drop, which will destroy ghash's mining earnings. Having already heavily invested in hardware, their only recourse will be to *increase* double-spending to scrape back any winnings they can as bitcoin plummets down the drain.
@_date: 2014-01-16 09:14:13
I've also noticed sqig, his attitude makes him stand out. Back when I was young we called it "flaming". He frequently makes statements like "nobody wants bit coin," which is so clearly, demonstrably false that it can only serve to irritate. The affected misspelling of Bitcoin is also intended to annoy people. Getting people annoyed is a bad way to get a rational discussion going. 
His related argument "there are already better alternatives" has also never been demonstrated. He claimed his bank could "send money to a phone number" but refused to name the bank or demonstrate the service. His history of groping after arguments against Bitcoin, but missing the most obvious ones (energy waste, 51%, volatility etc), also reflects poorly on his intelligence. At that point I stopped paying attention to him.
I've never engaged him on his economic arguments, for two reasons: 1. economics is barely a science, does not make reliable predictions, and is always closely tied to ideology and 2. Cryptocurrency adoption *is* increasing, and decentralized currency *is* attractive to individuals, regardless of whether it's good for the economy or not. This is why it's called a "disruptive" technology: it's going to change things, whether we like it or not. I'm much more interested in arguments like "here's why Freicoin is better for the economy" than "Bitcoin is bad for the economy"
The most forgiving attitude I can muster is that he's trying to annoy people to get them to pay attention to him, which is just sad. He should read a little bit more, and spout off less.
tl;dr he's a troll, I hope you take him with you when you leave.
@_date: 2014-01-16 09:33:40
Your post responded to an argument by providing an opinion and links in support. Sqig's post above made an assertion of universal truth with no evidence. If you're not sensitive to the difference in attitude, you're not very good at recognizing trolls, and I suspect the only reason you admire sqig is that you share his prejudices.

Excellent questions. For really good answers you should look further than In short:
 * Scalability is unsolved, but there are no proven showstoppers. 
 * Mining centralization is a serious problem. Possibly a change in algorithm will fix it. Possibly an alt coin has already solved it.
 * Transaction fees are a market, so, cartels excepted, will largely sink towards cost. However, attacking the network isn't priced in.

"Tremendous improvement" is par for the course. Technology is improving at an exponential rate, and exactly the things that make bitcoin strong (wide adoption) are it's weakness (difficulty changing the protocol). *Particularly* if you want to maintain it's most valuable aspect: **decentralization**. How do you coordinate a fundamental change in the bitcoin protocol in a decentralized way? It remains to be seen.
