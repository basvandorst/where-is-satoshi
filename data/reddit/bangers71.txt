Good idea re: using images as passwords but looks like someone is already on the case. Looks like others think its a good idea too as they've raised £55k on crowdcube

Bitcoin needs a professional team of dedicated "identity guardians". The awful yellow coin needs to be consigned to Bitcoin's history book and an identity that clearly represents what Bitcoin is, what it stands for and where it is going needs to hit our eyes sooner rather than later. Bitcoin is in major need of an organised PR strategy.

The deficit only really exploded post 1971.
Either way, I'm guessing we're on the same page and until any link to gold was done away with the banksters couldn't get on with robbing every last possible cent they could from hard working US citizens.
Back to my original point, gold on its own has already proven to be too inflexible to back global trade, even before trade was truly global. We now have what could be a far more flexible option more suitable for our times so debates such as the one in the video we are discussing should move on from the "gold" option.

But once this all pans out those holding the most money will become the financiers. There won't be many banks in that category. 
I'm sure they won't get involved in it which was kinda my point. So they'll join the obvious team fighting to stop bitcoin which might not work out too well for them

This is very true. I was discussing this with one of the guys from bitcoincard.org which started around bitcoins poor visual identity. I wrote up some ideas but the long and short of it was that as core bitcoin development is entrusted to a few guardians, bitcoin should have an entrusted team of "identity guardians" to start doin a better PR job than the community is doing itself
