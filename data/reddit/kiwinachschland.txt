LN is a way to allow small transactions to again become economical, but on a global scale. If you raise the block size to 10MB, the number of transactions bitcoin can handle would increase to roughly 40 per second, which is a tiny amount compared to the tens of thousands handled per second by visa for example. Blocks would fill up again, causing fees to rise, preventing people from making small transactions once again. Basically at the moment the maths for raising the block size to scale bitcoin just don't add up - 1 GB blocks are still too small.
In this system, miners deal with large and important transactions and receive fees, just like today. The second layer (lightning) allows individuals and companies to also receive fees for their lightning nodes, although they should be negligible in comparison to on-chain fees.
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:39:03
Bitcoin *shouldn't* fork to increase the block size, because that is a really bad idea. If we have good ideas that are implemented competently and thoroughly tested then we can and should fork.
BTW I think you're in the wrong sub. There was a fork of bitcoin to increase the block size. It's called bitcoin cash. Head over to @_date: 2018-01-25 12:18:03

Forget the term "bank". More generally, you earn interest on your bitcoin by lending it to someone (if you think about it, a bank deposit is just a loan to the bank that can be recalled at any time). This would work for bitcoin just like any other currency.

I don't mean to sound rude, but you've got some learning to do. This is a 6 billion dollar market. The price is driven by market forces, which are essentially the sum of millions of people's decision making. If anyone knew for certain why the price does what it does, they'd be a millionaire over night.
Don't try to pin the price down to something in particular, it's way too complicated and you'd just be deceiving yourself. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:24:27
No problem :-). Yeah the reasons why people buy/sell are massively diverse. Markets are totally resistant to prediction based on past price performance. If someone figures it out, then everyone else does the same thing which mitigates the benefits. Bitcoin is especially wild because of its polarising nature and small market cap.
@_date: 2015-12-17 15:59:53
You're talking about the last seven days I presume. Twice the price has almost reached 470 and come down. That doesn't make 470 a special number which some people don't want to reach. If the market decides that bitcoin is overbought, which it very well could be considering how fast the price is rising, then people pile in with shorts and the longs lose steam. The trouble is, no one knows exactly why or when this will happen. But it's only approached 470 twice. I'd call that a coincidence.

It's automatically active, you can check under Settings -&gt; Transactions.
To test it I would suggest hitting the + on the main screen, then PayNyms, and connecting to the Samourai Developers PayNym. That way you can test out payment codes and STONEWALL at the same time.
The result should be a transaction with more inputs/outputs than strictly necessary. For example my donation could have been done with 1 input and 2 outputs (change and payee). Instead it used 2 inputs and 4 outputs (3 change and 1 payee).

For bitcoin it does. There's no way all of the tens of thousands of nodes will be upgraded to the new software with looser consensus rules.
If we hard fork, there will be a "Bitcoin Classic" and "Bitcoin" situation. The Core devs aren't going to let that happen.
@_date: 2018-05-08 02:46:49
* We aren't going to reach consensus among node operators about increasing the block size.
* Node operators will therefore not be able to force miners to upgrade.

I was trying to find the right analogy but this is perfect. Do you have a response @_date: 2018-05-07 22:22:59


Those days are over for any properly decentralised currency. Monero's last hard fork resulted in I think **four** different chains afterwards. Ethereum is well aware that hard forking to return the Parity Hack funds will result in another split.
When networks get this big, and this decentralised, you simply can't upgrade by hard fork without some people refusing to upgrade and thus causing a chain split.
That BCH continues to achieve it indicates just how centralised node operation is on their chain.

You can tell if you're using segwit easily: does your wallet produce addresses starting with "1"? Then you're not using segwit. Does your wallet produce addresses starting with "3", or even better, "bc1"? Then great, you're using segwit.
As for understanding lightning, essentially you're just exchanging bitcoin transactions with another party without broadcasting them to the bitcoin network \(so they're not on\-chain and don't require a tx fee\). You can at any point choose to broadcast the latest transactions and claim your money on\-chain.
You probably won't be using lightning for another year at least though, unless you just want to mess around with it and donate to some developers.
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:51:40
My policy is this: if I don't have any urgency to get into the next block, I set the fee to 1 sat/byte, which is the lowest you can get away with. These days that means the longest you'll have to wait for a confirmation is a few hours, but normally it gets into the next block or two.
Anything above 10 sat/byte is overkill IMO. Only exchanges need to be paying higher fee rates to absolutely guarantee next block confirmation.

Sure. In order to get your transaction into the blockchain and thus processed on the global bitcoin network, you must pay a small fee. Nano however has a no fee. But they still need to add a small cost to each transaction in order to prevent the network having to handle a whole lot of spam transactions that any programmer could implement. The way they combat spam is with a small amount of PoW per transaction. The PoW took several seconds last I checked. Lightning in contrast allows money to be streamed directly over a payment channel with zero fees (no routing), and zero PoW.

Well then, I agree - libertarianism is about order without power. I don't know why you've associated it with crony capitalism/corporate socialism. But some of your comments suggest a kind of communism - completely at odds with anarchism. The rich should pay more for their milk? Rather Marxist.
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:12:42
I just donated to the devs to test it out. It uses multiple inputs and outputs to obfuscate the transaction, so that chain analysis can't as easily figure out which outputs are for change and which are for the payee. The fee was 348 sat at 1 sat / byte. So pretty good I think!

Yes, but that is already illegal. Nothing new here.
An example: I want to sell music files. I run an encrypted browser, and list the files on a decentralised marketplace. I receive payment for the files from someone through an untraceable service like dark wallet.
To my mind, the state won't be able to tell anything about this transaction. They won't know what the file was, they won't know who's buying and who's selling, and they won't know the quantity of money being exchanged.

I think the nano developer Colin Lemahieu is genuine and not a scammer. Unfortunately I would still call nano a shitcoin. The reason is that it is competing with bitcoin on the exchange of value between two people. Nano uses Pow to avoid spam and remain feeless. What this means is the nano cannot be "streamed" in the sense of sending multiple transactions per second. So if lightning enables a higher number of tps than nano, and bitcoin itself has a simple smart contracting language which doesn't exist in nano, what value does nano have? That's why I sold my nano; lightning works.

It is possible that with a lot of time and effort, and with small enough proposed changes, consensus will be reached.
However, this thread is about hard-forking to increase the block size. IMO, consensus will not be reached on this any time soon, so a hard fork *will* create a chain split.

I don't believe technology trumps society, whatever that means. I'm making a simple assertion: in the near future, tax evasion will become significantly easier, aided by bitcoin, encryption and decentralisation. This is a fact. I'm not saying tax is good or bad. I'm saying we as a society will have to deal with it.
Think about the original infographic of this post. There were far fewer taxes under King George III. That's not to say King George didn't want to tax. I think it's to say that King George didn't have computers, the internet, or a centralised banking system which, put together, make taxation very easy.
Imagine if we went back to a society with only physical cash. It would be *immensely* difficult (impossible) to tax society as it is done today (at least as equitably).
This is the future we're approaching - a future with digital, anonymous *cash*.
Edit: I and many others are not interested in flaunting wealth, so no, it would not be obvious. There are 320 million people in America alone. You try going after even 10% of that.

All three contributed greatly to bitcoin, especially Gavin. Mike Hearn did some good work in the early days with SPV. Garzik I'm not too familiar with apart from him being the author of the buggy segwit2x code, which I consider an attack on the network. I think they were valuable but have been replaced by more competent developers with time.
Mike's rage quit was pretty childish though, and I think his pushing for big blocks was misplaced.
The fact is the network was being spammed for months by people pushing an agenda. Without that spam, and with segwit and batching, 1mb is fine for the time being, so they were proven wrong.

Good job not addressing the main point of my post.
So what, there are wild fluctuations in a new technology, is anyone here surprised? Is your argument that we should never try to innovate in currency? We can't go from no bitcoin to massive adoption of bitcoin all at once, there has to be a middle ground.
@_date: 2014-10-23 07:30:22
There are two definitions of inflation. The first is when the supply of a currency expands. The second is when the price of goods and services in an economy increases. In this case we are talking about the first definition.
It works in Bitcoin's case by 25 bitcoin being released every ten minutes (for each block added to the blockchain). This is a mathematically encoded rate of inflation that decreases with time (it halves every few years).
In fiat currencies' case the money is physically printed or digitally added to a bank's ledger.
Why is a lack of inflation good for BTC?
This ties the two definitions at the top together. Simply put, if the money supply increases, but the amount of goods and services does not, prices will rise. This is obvious if you consider gold - it has a relatively constant supply, and money is printed at a faster rate than gold is mined. in the 60s, gold was worth around 30 USD. Today it is worth around 1300 USD, but in both cases, it was worth about enough to buy a man's suit.
The lack of inflation (of the money supply) means that in a bitcoin economy, prices will be falling (deflating). This represents an economy more akin to 1800s America on the gold standard. Falling prices drive the real wages of workers up (because they earn the same but everything is getting cheaper). They also incentivise thrift, prudence and saving, because you know your money will be able to get you more real value (goods and services) tomorrow. Tech is an industry that has experienced deflation for a long time. You know smartphones are getting cheaper and of higher quality every year. This doesn't put you off buying a smartphone completely - it just makes you think a bit more about your decision and maybe put it off for a bit.
One last thing I would say is there is an argument against deflation - that it leads to a spiral where people hold off spending long enough that prices fall further and they hold off longer again etc etc. This I feel is a fairly week argument. Obviously you're not going to stop buying food, nor any other necessity. Tech has shown us that you won't stop buying luxuries either - you'll just be more careful about your decision. Prices would reach an equilibrium, just as in any market.

No one is claiming bitcoin is intrinsically political. Bitcoin is intrinsically nothing, not even valuable. Its nature and use cases however are *clearly* at odds with statism, taxation and the current banking system.
It provides an opportunity to be self-banked, and with a little expertise, close to anonymous. How are you going to tax a transaction of digital goods on Open Bazaar if both the buyer and seller are anonymous?
A function of the financial industry is to allow wealth transfers across borders at a cost. This function is *clearly* under threat.
How about the stockmarket? We need to pay brokers to find a seller if we want to buy. This function is *clearly* under threat.
Lending and interest rates. Central banks try to control aggregate demand using interest rates to encourage spending. Since money is constantly being inflated and interest rates are low, capital owners and risk takers are rewarded while the prudent see the value of their money decline, and are rushed into investments they otherwise wouldn't have made yet because money is so cheap. A bitcoin economy will see *deflation* in prices, thus incentivising prudence and rewarding the saver.

The answers I see here are all based on how the market would solve these pollution problems (or not solve them) based on pure economics.
I think this is a problem we sometimes fall into when talking about the true free market. There is nothing about the free market that precludes *social* action. Often enough, purely monetary forces are not enough to produced a "desirable outcome" (unpolluted waterways).
So I would like to add that the populace, if their drinking water is being polluted, is not going to stand around and let that happen. They can protest, but they can also boycott the products of the bad actor. Other socially conscious businesses can also boycott the products of the bad actor. I think the notion that capitalism is all about greed and profit at all costs is false for most people. The people who are not sociopaths and have empathy are not totally driven by (short-term) profit. They can, do, and would stand up for what they believe is right.

Well I think you need to open your mind a little. No one is trying to sell you anything. You can choose to use bitcoin or not. It is true that bitcoin doesn't offer many immediate improvements to your every day life in first world countries in terms of payment *at the moment*. So if that's you, don't buy/use it.
You could however at least acknowledge its groundbreaking ability in assisting the unbanked in entering the global economy, its usefulness in remittance, and its inability to be meddled with by central bankers in places such as South America.

There will come a time in the not too distant future when the average person will be able to totally evade taxes. They will trade encrypted digital information for encrypted money.
Some will start to exchange physical goods as well. This will start to represent a significant decrease in revenue for the state, which hasn't happened in modern times.
The state will then have to react by 1) cutting spending significantly, which will severely damage the economy as we have seen with even minor austerity, 2) increase taxation significantly, which has it's limits of effectiveness, or 3) print their way out of it, leading to hyperinflation and collapse.
So my point is - a drastically different world without huge taxation on everything is coming. A world where government revenue is significantly lowered. If you think that infrastructure will fall apart and healthcare and education won't function, then you must acknowledge the imminent collapse of a society brought about by encryption.
Either that, or you could ask the question "could these things function without the state?", and genuinely attempt to research the implications.

This is an insult suggesting that the OP was talking about the state as it exists in America. You don't know where the OP is from, and neither do I. I am not from nor have I ever been to America. Libertarianism is not a US phenomenon. It is an ancient phenomenon, more recently being espoused by Austrian Economists.


Huh? Not being aggressive is now bourgeois?


This is not a counter argument. Congress is not accountable to the people. The few control our money, they tell us where, how and for whom we can work with whom we can trade.


Not essentially in the USA. In the entire first world, real wages have been stagnant for decades.

"Printing money" is just an easier way of saying "Entering numbers into a computer to create money". The Fed *is* expanding the monetary base.
2) Agreed.
3) While theoretically you are correct (the Fed is meant to be apolitical, and has only a narrow mandate), the results of ZIRP and QE paint a different picture. Whether or not Yellen and the rest of them are doing it intentionally is irrelevant. It is a result of Keynesian economics being the chosen strategy of the last century.

So we are constantly told that deflation is bad.
Why is it bad?
Because it could lead to a "deflationary spiral", where people put off spending because they know things are getting cheaper, making things even more cheap and so on.
Why I think this is wrong:
There are several industries that have been highly deflationary for a long time. Tech is in constant, massive deflation. You know that smartphones are getting better and better at a ridiculous pace, as well as getting cheaper. Does that stop you buying a smartphone? No, although it may make you spend your money more prudently.
What would you do if food was falling in price? Would you not eat? Of course you would eat.
The truth is that deflation favours the prudent: savers, long term investors, wage works (deflation pushes up the real value of wages).
Inflation favours the risk takers and the capital owners. It also favours government, because it can be used as a form of taxation: slowly devaluing your nation's currency as a way to pay off the debt you've accumulated.
Ultimately, the people in charge - government and private banks - stand to lose a lot under a deflationary environment.

The pound has a market cap in the tens of trillions. Bitcoin's market cap is just over 6 billion USD. It takes a massive trade in pounds to shift the price, and not so big a trade in bitcoin.

Libertarianism is not confined to the United States. There's no need for ad hominem.
By its very definition, the state is the law of the few. The massive expansion of the state we have seen since the 60s has only widened the wealth gap, and increased the power of the aristocracy. The current QE program is a great example of the state supporting the rich at the expense of the poor.

There are three ways for deflation of prices to occur:
1) Demand falls, supply remains constant
2) Demand remains constant, supply rises
3) Demand falls and supply rises
A good, healthy economy would be number 2. Japan is number 1, just as the US was in the great depression.
We have yet to see a society where the overall supply of goods and services outstrips demand, thus pushing prices down. As mentioned, there are industries that exhibit this (tech).

OK, I understand what you mean now. Correct me if I'm wrong, but in this system you're proposing, how much you pay for any good or service should be dependent on your income, correct?
If so, how do you enforce this in individual trades between two people (guy goes to bakery in his local town of 1,000 people to buy bread).
* 1. How much does he pay?
* 2. If he pays a proportion of his wealth, who calculates it?
* 3. Is this calculation done for every transaction?
* 4. How do you enforce this kind of trade without massive threat of violence, i.e. a police state? If a man goes to the store and says "I'll give you a bushel of corn for one loaf of bread", how is that trade controlled? How do you enforce your payment system?

Let's take this from another angle. Country A charges VAT of 20%, country B charges VAT of 10%. The consumer may not *know* or directly *care* about this higher tax, but the fact is *they are paying the price for it*. In a sense, the *economy as a whole* knows; there's no free lunch.
That's like saying "I don't care about how much tax I pay, it doesn't affect anything, all i care about is how much I have left over". But of course your employer sees outgoings equivalent to your gross salary, and you only see incomings equivalent to your net salary. The employer is therefore forced to lower you salary, because he's only getting a worker of quality equivalent to the net salary, but he's paying for a worker of quality equivalent to the gross salary.

There's a thing called income mobility. The poor are not always the same people. Some become rich, some rich squander their wealth and become poor.

If you're average Joe Maori living in the forest just after some other Maori chieftain somewhere else in the country signed that contract, and you were approached by a white skinned man asking for a proportion of your income, you would rightly think that he was mad. Yet somehow you have to pay taxes, simply because if you don't you will be shot or locked in a cage.

* No, it does not set fiscal policy, but Yellen especially repeatedly talks about how QE is necessary for job creation for the poor.
* Absolutely correct. Inflation drives down the value of debt. The biggest debtor is the US government.
* The Fed is not tied directly to the tax payer, but it is a fair call to say that QE and ZIRP favour the wealthy over the poor. QE especially has provided huge liquidity to the stockmarket, driving it up. Even the BoE has stated that QE benefits the wealthy most of all.
* Inflation only occurs when money gets some velocity, which obviously it hasn't (yet). The fact is that the money was created to purchase financial instruments - debt - owned overwhelmingly by the wealthy.

Bitcoin is not a product that enables you to use a network. Bitcoin *is* the network. Bitcoin doesn't have any security flaws. The blockchain has been secure for six years with barely a hitch.
The internet allows for the peer to peer transfer of information. Bitcoin is a network which allows you to send digital scarcity - a piece of information - to *"places it had never been"*.
At this point I don't think you understand Bitcoin very much. Let's be clear. Bitcoin is *not* blockchain.info, or electrum, or counterparty, or bitstamp, or trezor or MtGox. Their security flaws, and the security flaws of windows, chrome, IE etc. are *not* Bitcoin's security flaws.

IIRC pendingchannels should show channels which are waiting to be closed. Did you force\-close the channels?
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:52:42
You're over\-thinking this. 
1. The well\-connected node \(or hub\) opens a channel with capacity of 1 BTC to the merchant.
2. Many individuals open smaller channels \(let's say 0.5 BTC\) to the hub.
3. When an individual pays the merchant 0.1 BTC, the balance in their channel changes to 0.4 BTC owned by the individual, and 0.1 BTC owned by the hub. The hub forwards the transaction to the merchant, so their channel now has a balance of 0.9 BTC owned by the hub and 0.1 BTC owned by the merchant.
4. The hub therefore does not need to "retain the 1 BTC indefinitely", because they have an increased balance in another incoming channel for every payment they forward to the merchant.
5. Eventually the payment hub will have to re\-balance their channels. The simplest way is to close and re\-open the channel with two on\-chain payments, but there are solutions that can reduce that to a single on\-chain payment.

There is no such thing as a "too high" fee. If someone paid a fee, they did so voluntarily, and they valued getting their transaction confirmed quickly higher than the cost of the fee.

Your lack of understanding of this market is really shining through here. If another crytocurrency "muscles out" bitcoin, I could wait 3 years after it achieves dominance and *still* be an early adopter.

You cannot separate the token from the blockchain. A blockchain without a financial insentive to secure it is just a glorified sql database. Whether it is the current 'bitcoin' token or not that proves to be revolutionary is irrelevant.


It doesn't need to be acquired on an exchange. It can be acquired with cash, with other cryptocurrency, by mining it, by earning it through work or by selling products for it on OpenBazaar for example.


Plenty of people are willing to separate from their bitcoin to purchase things they want. I am one, and the number is only increasing. Your criticisms sound like someone in the early 90s claiming that because you had to record the IP addresses of websites you wanted to visit that the internet would never work. In 2008 the only people capable of using bitcoin were those with knowledge of terminal commands and means and willingness to run a full node. In 2013 there was only one exchange which caused a two year bear market when it collapsed. Where are we in Feb 2018? A hell of a long way forward, and we're only just getting started.

The value of gold is not exclusively tied to its uses in industry or even its shininess. Its scarcity and difficulty to counterfeit, plus a history of stable use give it the majority of its value. Bitcoin just does away with those few physical applications and makes the claim that as long as money is useful, scarce, fungible and hard/impossible to counterfeit, it has value.
@_date: 2015-04-17 14:58:50


That just shows a fundamental lack of understanding - or you're trolling. Every single government in the world could coordinate and ban it, heck even put a life sentence on its use. It would go on being used and it would go on having value - **because it solves a problem.**
Some people, somewhere, for whatever purpose, need to transact anonymously and outside of the banking system. Bitcoin not only allows them to do that, but it allows them to do that quickly, easily, and reliably.
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:51:45
It's funny, because you claim to understand this technology but clearly don't. Trying to ban bitcoin is the equivalent of trying to ban a computer from broadcasting a string. That's all a btc transaction is.
Sure bitcoin is currently pseudonymous, but once it's fully anonymous the government won't know or be able to prove who has what. The day the government bashes people's doors down and asks for a random sum of money which is unprovably owned by the suspected tax evader is a dark day indeed. It's a state where the basic rule of law has long since evaporated, and we are not there yet.

You're falling into the same trap as Krugman. Bitcoin would have zero value without the internet, but gold's value might be a few dollars instead of a few thousand without the psychological component. So bitcoin loses 100% of its value, gold loses 99%. What's the big difference?
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:21:56


Placing a ceiling on the value of gold is mining technology, and the prospect that if its price gets out of whack for long on the upside a great deal more of it will be created. Placing a ceiling on the value of the dollar is the Federal Reserve’s role as actual dollar source, and its commitment not to allow deflation to happen.
Placing a ceiling on the value of bitcoins is computer technology and the form of the hash function… until the limit of 21 million bitcoins is reached. Placing a floor on the value of bitcoins is… what, exactly?
How does he not get this? How does a Nobel laureate in economics not understand why this argument is worthless?
The shininess value of gold may be a non-zero amount, but it is at most a fraction of one percent of the value of gold. If you take away the psychology, gold is as good as worthless.

While what you have said is correct, the point is that lightning transactions are literally signed bitcoin transactions, and can be redeemed as such. The developers seem to think that staying online (you don't even really have to stay online, you just have to check in every 24 hours to ensure no channels have been force closed) and holding on to transactions won't be an insurmountable challenge, which seems reasonable to me.

No, it is not. Look at interest payments as a percentage of tax income. Interest rates have been falling on government debt for decades, yet the proportion of interest payments to tax income has stayed the same, around 20 to 25%. What happens now that they can't lower interest rates further? The proportion of interest to tax income rises. When the US government starts paying half of tax revenue in interest, it's all over.
They can't just increase taxes. That won't increase tax revenue enough (and has the potential to tank economic activity even more).

That was your claim that people have issues with. The national debt in the US differs with that statement. Without a major war such as WW2, and *even with* exponential growth in technology, the US economy can't grow fast enough to keep the debt at a constant proportion of GDP. The US government can't turn off a massive part of spending (like at the end of WW2). It is therefore unsustainable.

The way it was described to me by my local Greek pizzeria owner (in New Zealand) is that Greeks are hard workers, they're just not fiscally responsible.

They then wonder why they have nothing left at the end of the day.
A better way to put it may be that Germans are better at long-term planning than Greeks.
