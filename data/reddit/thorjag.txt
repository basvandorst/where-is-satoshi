Isn't this what rootstock proposes? The influence of the federated signers decreases as the merge-mining hashrate increases. In the end you could make a soft-fork forcing all miners to support the sidechain, thus making it part of Bitcoin.

Do you mean segwit? They are just voicing support for the technology. Their votes doesn't actually count towards activation of it.
However, I feel segwit is being very well-tested.

Good job! Can you do something about the bullshit comments as well? :)
@_date: 2016-04-19 13:13:14


Its just the string segwit in the coinbase. Nothing else. Just as some miners voice support for BIP100 still.


With BIP9 there is a start date for voting. The CSV soft fork, for example, will not start counting the votes until may 1st.


I think all soft forks have a grace period of one retargeting period.
@_date: 2016-04-19 13:25:31
It is not a vote for any soft fork actually. Voting for CSV will not start until may 1st.
@_date: 2016-04-20 06:24:04
Even so, votes before may 1st will not counted, and since it will count votes from the previous ~2000 blocks it cannot have 95% of the votes by may 1st. 95% of the hashing power could be running software that will vote that way, absolutely. 
There is also a grace period of ~2000 blocks, yes. Basically the earliest it can activate is end of may.
@_date: 2016-04-11 13:31:39
No, not as long as the base layer, i.e, Bitcoin, is decentralized.

That is the number of BIP109 blocks. He is talking about BIP9.
@_date: 2016-04-20 12:13:43
I don't think they implement the full BIP9. They only use a bit to signal the fork in accordance to the specification.

End of may if anything. I think votes only are counted when retargeting occurs and then activates the next, if 95% was reached.

Wouldn't a good solution be increasing fees as your counterparty's funds go low? If it gets close to zero, ludicrous fees are offered if he wants to make payments, instead of a total cut-off.
@_date: 2016-04-15 11:39:20
When a soft fork activates/expires, the bit is recycled and can be used for another soft fork. There are 29 bits available IIRC. A future cleanup hard fork should allow  32 bits.

I am not imposing anything. 0-conf insecurity is a fact, with or without RBF.
@_date: 2015-12-01 11:50:04
Why no mention of GBT?
GBT would be decentralized mining (choosing the transactions that go in a block) for any device (that can run a full node) with a low variance (with the caveat that the central pool needs to be trusted to pay out your rewards). This seems like the best of both worlds; As decentralized as P2Pool without bloating the coinbase transaction.
@_date: 2015-06-30 06:58:38
Bottom line is that Bitcoin is not designed to secure 0-conf transactions. If you want to trust them, fine, as long as you are aware of the risks.
I merely want to point out that 0-conf txs are inherently insecure and you are better off using centralized services like coinbase if your goal is instant transactions. Or better yet wait for lightning to be built and deployed.
@_date: 2015-12-01 16:35:56
If you truly belive it is big blocks vs small blocks, then I agree it is slanted. There is more to scaling than block size though, as you can see from the topics listed.
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:42:45
If I recall, it will require a soft-fork, and if someone opposes it then it should be altered, according to the objections presented. This is what is happening with the blocksize debate. Objections, counter-proposals, discussions. As it should be.
I doubt Gavin is so unprofessional that he would veto it solely for revenge in this block-size debate, and any objections would probably be technical in nature and worked through.
Of course they may have a head-start, but if the technology they produce is that good, shouldn't they do it? That is how the market works right? Both sidechains, LN and Bitcoin are being developed openly, so you can follow the development easily and raise concerns at any point if they deviate from what should be in the best of Bitcoin's future.
Should they stop work on all the cool stuff they have implemented on their current sidechain? Do you think confidential transactions by should be scrapped because he will have such a head-start with the technology and somehow profit on it later?
@_date: 2015-12-15 15:29:06


The summary was written not too long ago. Sending small sums has never really been viable (especially sub ~500 satoshis). From what I understand on the mailing list, even sub-satoshi payments will be viable in LN.


They are not describing SW. There are other ways to fix malleability. IIRC Tadge wanted a SIG_HASH_NO_INPUT flag. SW has so many more advantages though that it makes no sense to do anything else.


I would say it is good for scalability in that it supports very nice pruning (throw away signatures after verification) and lower bandwidth requirements (for a different security model where the node skips checking signatures and don't need these sent).
@_date: 2015-12-02 07:03:37
The point of decentralization is to protect the censorship-resistance of the system. By having the owner of the hashing power set the policy of what transactions go into a block instead of a large pool, we can achieve this. It should be a concern to everyone.
@_date: 2015-12-15 11:51:03
My guess is it will be just like Bitcoin. In the beginning those who are very interested in it will start using it on a small scale, finding bugs and fixing them until more and more people join.
Probably won't take as many years to gain popularity as LN isn't as obscure as Bitcoin was when it was first released.
@_date: 2015-12-24 06:52:52


Incorrect. If users don't agree they don't have to upgrade, and from their point of view miners who accept the hard fork would create invalid blocks which users will not follow. Imagine if miners decided to double their reward (hard fork). Do you think users would follow that chain? I highly doubt it.


Actually it doesn't need supermajority. Core chooses to require super majority to not leave miners behind. This means that miners with &gt;5% can veto a soft fork. This is why no contentious soft forks are ever proposed. If SFSW is truly contentious, as you assert, then it will not succeed.


I mean from the point of view of the user accepting such a transaction. They should not accept an unconfirmed transaction that spent from such an output.


This is not as difficult as you might think.
@_date: 2015-06-30 06:44:50


Its not a lock. Its an open door.
Most 0-conf txs aren't double spent, just like most houses aren't robbed for not locking their door.
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:09:59
Brilliant PR stunt by Peter Todd. He wants to highlight the dangers of zero-conf transactions and managed to create controversy with the help of a big mining pool. As part of the plan the mining pool quickly changed to FSS RBF. And the issue is now a hot topic! Am I wrong @_date: 2015-12-30 09:52:37
Balances are maintained in transactions that are not sent to the blockchain, but could be broadcasted and included in blocks at any time. The balances of this transaction are updated whenever necessary and the previous transaction is made invalid by revealing secrets to each other to make sure that the cheating party's funds can  be 'stolen' when a previously invalidated transaction is spent. The output scripts are designed in a way to incentivize both parties of the channel to only spend the last agreed upon transaction including time-locks and hash-locks.
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:33:00
No counter-proposal yet from blockstream, but very well a BIP from Jeff and many propsals on the dev mailing-list, including from people from blockstream. My guess is it is just a matter of time before they put up a concrete BIP.

@_date: 2015-12-08 07:42:50


I guess it should be called a soft-hard fork. Soft for SPV clients and hard for fully validating nodes.


They would see the transactions as anyone-can-spend, thus they will evaluate them to true. If they are not upgraded they should only perform or rely ontransaction types they are familiar with anyway. 


Non-upgraded nodes would interpret the new type of transaction as a transaction they would be able to spend themselves, without any signatures. Similar to how non-upgraded nodes before P2SH would see those types of transactions as 'free money'.
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:19:53
is spot on. And hubs don't have to be online 24/7. When LN is bootstrapped there may be few hubs, but as time progresses more and more hubs will appear and users can start up multiple payment routes so that even if some hubs are temporarily down, some hubs will be up.
@_date: 2015-12-01 20:43:57
As far as I understand it, the only centralized part of it would be that the reward is paid to the pool. The owner of the equipment decides (to some extent) what goes into a block, only the coinbase is set to pay out to the pool. It is like solo mining, but the reward goes to the pool.
It was a long time ago I read up on GBT, and even then I did not dive deep enough. I wonder if I am missing something. Ping @_date: 2015-12-15 13:35:24
You can, however, put the lightning transaction on the blockchain anytime you want.
Would you argue that timelocked transactions are not bitcoin because you had to wait for the appropriate time until you could publish your transaction? (With CLTV this is no longer the case though)
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:24:47
No SPV mining issues so far? I noticed there still have been a couple of v3 blocks not too long ago (Before enforcement though).
@_date: 2015-12-15 14:09:30


CLTV is part of the protocol as of yesterday. The necessary OP codes for LN transactions will also be a part of the bitcoin protocol, thus LN transactions are Bitcoin transactions. So far just OP_CSV is missing.
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:53:22
Why aren't you setting the mining threshold to 95% like every other soft fork? I thought you said you had consensus from almost everyone, so what are you afraid of?
@_date: 2015-06-26 09:44:58
I understand it may be difficult for people to understand that, but consider the Internet in the beginning. There was no security built in because there were few people using it and to some extent these people trusted each other. As more users got connected some really bad eggs started to appear. Today Internet experts are kicking themselves for making the assumption that Internet users would behave.
We should not make the assumption that miners will behave. We may be able to expect them to today, but in the future when/if Bitcoin hits mainstream and there is little chance for it be break down or be outlawed some miners may very well begin to accept higher fees for double spends to be able to stay in business. 
Full RBF would make sure we use the system as it was intended without any dreams of zero-conf being safe, even if that means no coffee for bitcoins in the foreseeable future until Lightning is available. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:19:38

@_date: 2015-06-17 20:06:27
I disagree. Proper consensus is 100%, which may not always be reasonable, but 75% is certainly not consensus. Even if 51% adopted the hard fork the other chain could continue without them.

@_date: 2015-12-23 14:58:19


Care to elaborate? Are you talking about a transaction script malfunctioning?


Could happen. Would most likely be fixed.


Only the specific route would be affected. The rest of the network will not suffer.


Considering onion routing is most likely to be used, intermediaries cannot censor individual transactions based on destination since they won't know the destination.


There will most likely not be any big 'hubs' that everyone connects to. There will be larger nodes and smaller nodes. You are probably going to have several channels open and whenever a node goes down that you have a channel open with you use one of the other nodes you are connected with to route your payment.


Always a possibility with any software not limited to lightning implementations. Exploits against normal wallets is also a threat.
@_date: 2015-12-23 13:55:03
Is it contentious though? Haven't seen a lot of criticism. It would be less dangerous though since it just makes the consensus rules more strict requiring only miners to upgrade, and no one else.
Old transaction types still works and there is no need for wallets to upgrade unless they want to use the new functionality. An old wallet wouldn't generate an address that would spend bitcoins to an anyone-can-spend address, now would they?
Making SW a hard fork would force ALL participants to upgrade (including SPV clients). With a soft fork they can take their time to implement it without feeling the pressure of a deadline set by other people. Makes sense IMO.
@_date: 2015-12-08 07:23:54


Can't miners just add an additional OP_RETURN output in the coinbase transaction with the necessary data for SW?


With a hard fork pretty much all bitcoin software will have to be upgraded which is not reasonable IMO. Non-upgraded nodes will see new SW-transactions as free money, but if the old nodes just stick to the types of transactions they can handle it shouldn't be a problem.
Wallet software will have to be upgraded to use the new SW-transactions in order for block space to be freed up.
This is my understanding of it. Please correct me if I am wrong.
@_date: 2015-12-15 13:32:26
A lightning transaction is also a bitcoin transaction. So saying that lightning transactions are a subset of bitcoin transactions is not incorrect. 
Would you argue that P2SH, and other transaction types (SW transactions soon?) are not Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:23:23
I don't know why you keep saying it is centralized. Tell me exactly how it is centralized. Anyone can set up a hub if they have the resources (just like miners, i.e, you don't have to ask anyone permission to set it up). No one is forced to use a specific hub for their channel, so the market will sort out the bad eggs. No hub can steal your funds. At worst, if a node in a payment route is missing you can retrieve your funds after an amount of time. How does any of this make you label it centralized? 
@_date: 2015-12-23 17:31:41


Do you mean when someone tries to craft a custom advanced script and fails or that the actual script interpretation won't deliver the expected result?


Can chime in here? What is the expected computational load per payment? Are there any estimates?


Note that there are no hubs in the lightning network. It is not designed as a hub-and-spoke model (unless you define a node with a large amount of funds locked up as a hub). I assume that over time some nodes will develop a reputation where the funds on the channel and the timeouts can be set according to that nodes reputation.
I'm betting that there is going to be a lot of trial and error in designing lightning.
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:43:42


There is no way for them to steal your bitcoins. They are not required to be on 24/7. You can have multiple connections setup and use the ones that are online at the time that you would need them. If one of them never comes online you can retrieve your funds with a time delay. Most important of all: no one is forcing you to use the LN.


You don't get it. If LN takes off, the fees can be a lot greater per transaction on chain, but given that you can perform hundreds, thousands, millions transactions in the payment channels the fee for the on-chain transactions averages out to perhaps even a much smaller fee than if each of those transactions would have happened directly on the blockchain.


Of course federated pegs are centralized, but the point is still that no one forces you to use them.


Actually it doesn't. The sidechain could use a different hashing algo.


No one is forcing them to. If they think it will be worth it, they will support it, otherwise they won't. Just like they wont support BIP101 right now because of the lack of consensus.


This is your opinion. I do not share it and think it is the other side who is hindering progress by trying to do a hard fork with Bitcoin XT.
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:05:49


It absolutely can be offered to a miner and that miner can in turn include it in a block.

A hard fork is a hack. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 08:02:46
I don't think XT was ever really an option for any miner or serious business. My guess is that all this drama was created to move the discussion about block-size increases forward. I doubt Gavin or Mike seriously thought anyone other than hardcore block-size increase proponents would use that software.
@_date: 2015-12-15 10:11:06
He joined via Skype.
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:48:35
I disagree. Just as miners can choose not to process your transactions (until another one chooses to), a hub going down would merely delay your funds coming back to you until the timelock has expired. At no point would I consider it centralized and is very much in line with how Bitcoin should work.
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:25:44
You could mine at a pool that supports GetBlockTemplate. Then you decide what is included in the block (except for coinbase transaction).
I think you have some freedoms with P2Pool also, but I am not sure.
@_date: 2015-06-30 06:49:50
It gives a false sense of security. It is very easy to double-spend transactions today even without RBF. With Full RBF even those less technical can do it easily. I is better to show how bad 0-conf is today than letting it work and give massive headaches in the future when it is abused en masse.

Bad analogy. We get better locks, waiting for one or more confirmations.

I said they are working on a write-up. 
If Gavin has good grounds to block it all-together, then it is probably wise to stop and think again (just like with this block-size debate).


If what you claim proves to be true, then it should be stopped. I don't think that is the case though, but time will tell after more research is being made on the subject. The good thing is they are trying things out on the testnet first.
@_date: 2015-06-20 09:34:19
It is a good thing when people who know about security points it out. Zero-conf transactions will never be secure, and other layers on top of Bitcoin to solve this will be necessary. Its a shame that people here on reddit are so hateful that they cannot see this. Just like we need TCP on top of IP to make communications on the Internet reliable, we will also need another protocol on top of Bitcoin to make it more reliable (with regards to zero-conf transactions). 


To be fair, Gavin and Mike are also pushing their agenda and a significant amount of people think their approach will destroy the things we love about bitcoin.


The thing is that his change already has consensus, since we all have agreed that this is the way the system works. If there were a better way to do it it would have been implemented, but it is impossible to secure zero-conf transactions, so it is better to be aware and not encourage businesses to accept them. Businesses who are dependent on zero-conf transactions are better off waiting for layer-2 solutions that can guarantee them.
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:40:22
It may be a simple fix, but it is a hack nonetheless.
Code complexity should be preferred over a hard fork.
@_date: 2015-12-23 17:24:46


I disagree. You don't need a few big nodes with lots of traffic. You could design the network to have many nodes with little individual traffic. Check out Tadge's and Joseph's presentations at the scaling bitcoin conference on how they plan to achieve this characteristic.


The node sending you funds isn't necessarily the originating payer. It will provide censorship resistance for both senders and recipients. If you are forbidden from receiving funds from a particular node you wouldn't even have a channel open with it. And that node can still send through you via other nodes.

All nodes are hubs then.


They don't necessarily need to stay online. They can come and go as they please. If they are offline for an extended period of time, the counterpart may unilaterally close the channel, but going offline now and then should be perfectly acceptable. 


There is some discussion to have lightning nodes create channels with a couple of random peers when they bootstrap. This would create an arbitrary mesh which should have pretty good connectivity between everyone on the network. Even if some nodes go offline now and then.
Another option was to have good geographically local connectivity. For instance if Alice want to buy coffee from Starbucks, finds no path so she opens a channel with them and funds the channel maybe 10x worth of coffee. When Bob, who already has a channel with starbucks, wants to pay Alice for some service they don't have to setup a new channel. Bob pays via starbucks. In this way a good local mesh network can be created where no node gets arbitrarily big.


I disagree.
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:37:52

Since they are doing everything open source they are inviting a lot of competition if it is as lucrative as you say. I see it as being good for Bitcoin as a whole and making bitcoins more valuable.
You said in another post that you weren't opposed to LN because it preserves fees, so I assume you are talking about SC again. I don't see how your vision is true, as SC right now is made for testing new functionality as in their alpha elements chain on testnet. Again, there is no one forcing anyone to using SC if they prove to be bad for Bitcoin, and that is the way development in the Bitcoin-space should move forward. Not with forced hard-forks.
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:43:16
Very true. People who don't get that should not use Bitcoin.

You could create a transaction spending the LN transaction with an output to your intended recipient. This assumes that your counterparty is willing to close the channel gracefully so you don't suffer the timeout.

[Quote]( by Greg Maxwell:
"Moreover, Blockstreams business plans depend on success (and survival!) of Bitcoin, and the specific technical things we're working on would be aided by increased block sizes if not for tradeoffs against decentralization (in particular, the 2wp return proofs are fairly big, and it took a second significant breakthrough to get their size viable at in a world with 1MB blocks). We've arranged it so that everyone at blockstream has a substantial Bitcoin interest (by using timelocked bitcoin as incentive/retention compensation)"

It is great that XT exists, with the current patches, but if the hard-fork patch is ever implemented and there isn't consensus I would consider it a dangerous attempt to highjack Bitcoins network effect.
I doubt anyone in the Bitcoin industry would seriously use XT if it is clear that there isn't consensus. Rather I think the whole XT hard fork was a brilliant move by Gavin and Mike to force a discussion on this issue. I recall mentioning them having a writeup on an alternative solution to BIP100/101, which is great. I hope there will be even more BIPs with regards to the blocksize increase and then reach a consensus on one or a mix of all the BIPs.

Neither Gavin nor Mike wanted to/couldn't attend. There is a talk on BIP101 block propagation though.
BIg block supporters seem to rally around BIP101 and generally seem uninterested in supporting any alternatives, while those opposing BIP101 have made multiple proposals. I don't see any reason why half of the talks should be about BIP101 just because its 'fair'. Better get a wide array of proposals presented.

It is difficult to prevent it since only a majority of miners are necessary to enforce a soft fork.


Old nodes still validate old rules, the rules they signed on to enforce when they installed/last upgraded their software. They should be wary of other types of transactions they don't recognize. I see no problem here.


Wallets should definitely check the output of a spending transaction to make sure it isn't an anyone-can-spend. It is never reasonable to assume that an anyone-can-spend transaction output could go to you, because miners would be the first to include such outputs to themselves when they mine a block. Why would they let such an output go to you? Should such a transaction occur, the wallet should issue an alert to the user to wait for multiple confirmations. 
This is the same issue for P2SH transactions, which are also anyone-can-spend transactions for unupgraded nodes.


This is possible today with SPV clients. Old full nodes get SPV security and should wait for confirmations, especially for unknown transaction types.
Happy holidays!

I wonder if this is true. It would allow the owner of one of these embedded chips to solo mine and provide an SPV proof to the chip that the correct amount is paid to 21s address in order for it to start hashing. 
Would it be possible to connect the chip to any pool in some way? I am finding it difficult to think of a way to do this since the block header is provided by the pool and the chip can't verify if hashing it will pay the correct amount to 21s address. Perhaps if the pool uses getBlocktemplate?
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:01:10
Centralization vs. Decentralization. If they only allow the chip to mine at their pool it will be bad for decentralization. The image raises hope that they may have a way to allow the owner of the chip to point the hashing power to any pool (or at least solo mine) and still allow 21 to receive their 75% of the reward.
@_date: 2015-05-03 06:20:05
A more interesting option if you are ever coerced into revealing your credentials is to have some sort of panic passphrase/PIN in the trezor which uses a second seed. This would give the wallet owner plausible deniability over any funds the blackmailer suspects you of having.  Just load the "panic" wallet with an insignificant amount of funds.
@_date: 2015-05-31 08:26:53
Neither am I. 51% of the hashing power can be spread out over multiple miners colluding. If their goal is to control block size, 51% is effectively 100%, whether its 1 miner or 10 miners.
@_date: 2015-05-31 19:49:25
With bigger blocks fewer people will run full nodes. If The block size is increased everyone on the blockchain is forced in the centralization of the system while with off-chain transactions like on coinbase people can choose to do it if they dont want to pay slightly higher fees.
Your tradeoff logic is flawed.

And then there are the inventors with their own solution. Everyone seems to be collaborating to make sure all implementations are interoperable though.

LN is being developed by multiple parties in an open fashion. Blockstream, blockchain and the LN inventors Poon and Dryja are all separately working on implementations.

As far as I understand it only CLTV Is required for LN to function. CSV &gt; CLTV indeed due to immortal channels. But segwit is also not required if you do channel monitoring yourself. 
I think rusty wrote in his previous [deployable-lightning.pdf]( a way to setup channels trustlessly despite malleable transactions. Since everyone is expecting segwit, no one is doing this since it is unnecessarily complex.
Am I missing something?
@_date: 2016-06-10 11:58:30
Better how? Please elaborate.
@_date: 2016-06-10 08:46:33
It is more efficient to include the extra inputs and outputs in an existing transaction than to create a new one. A transaction consists of more than just its inputs and outputs, thus it would be smaller, and by extension cheaper with one transaction rather than two.
@_date: 2016-06-10 08:18:40
Only better when you don't have control over the stuck transaction, i.e, you were not the sender. Definitely not more efficient.
@_date: 2016-06-19 12:23:00
Actually it is not the last 2016 blocks. It is the blocks since the last retargeting, and only on the next retargeting will it check to see if 95% is reached for those 2016 blocks. Would be great if you could visualize it with a vertical line at the goal if it is possible to reach it. When 95% is no longer possible, it is red, otherwise it is green. Or something like that...
@_date: 2016-06-01 06:21:29

@_date: 2016-06-08 14:56:09
It looks like there is a good chance of 95% occurring during this retargeting period. Since the beginning of this retargeting period (96 blocks) only 8 non-CSV blocks were mined and only ~15% of Slushs hashrate will create non-CSV blocks (~1% of total hashrate), assuming don't care votes go to Core. Otherwise there is just Telco 214 and Eligius that don't signal CSV yet (&lt;1%) and some of the unknown hashrate. I'd say there is a pretty good chance we make it.
@_date: 2016-06-21 05:36:58
Its RC1 for 0.13.0, right? Major versions don't have soft forks in them, as per their policy. Maybe they will release 0.12.2 simultaneously that will include segwit?

Certainly this is only practical when mining is as centralized as it is. If mining becomes sufficiently decentralized, bitcoin fees would be the only logical approach to get transactions in blocks.
@_date: 2016-06-10 10:50:41
Can you give an example of a process where multiple transactions are required and combining inputs and outputs is out of the question? Multisig signers not being helpful falls under the category of not being able to change the initial transaction, and in that case CPFP is of course the way to go.
Point is, in most (all?) cases where RBF is possible, it is more efficient and cheaper than CPFP.

I could be wrong, but I think CPFP requires that you send both child and parent. In that case bandwidth is better with RBF. 
If that isn't the case I would say block-space (even without a limit) is a way more valuable resource than bandwidth.
@_date: 2016-06-08 13:42:30

Right, required was a poor choice of words. But IIRC the implementation will send the parent along with the child just in case the receiving nodes haven't received that tx yet. Or maybe it even was evicted from the mempool.

I.e, if bandwidth is expensive you are not incentivized to run a full node. In this way to sync your node via the satellites and pay for bandwidth when broadcasting transactions.

That goes for any number of monitor services there are. Or are you expecting to use multiple ones at the same time? My guess is since it will require a whole lot of storage requirement, you will not just be able to register freely to all of them.
Again if we assume a single monitor on the network, it would still be pretty good because your counterpart will likely not want to risk having all funds taken from her just to try to steal from you. Even if the one monitoring is incompetent, it provides incentives for your counterpart not to cheat.

See figure 8. It is pretty complex and since segwit is already on the way, no one bothers with this method. 
One thing that isn't possible with that method is the outsourcing of channel monitoring.
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:03:21
Cool! Will you make it compatible with the lightning network? @_date: 2016-12-12 18:42:39
You don't need these third parties. You can monitor the blockchain yourself.
IMO it doesn't matter if one giant organization handles all channel monitoring. Unless revoked transactions are broadcast, they will not get any information from you. You can also easily test them to see that they are monitoring properly, by creating a channel with yourself and closing it at a revoked state. 
Only issue with just one third party monitor might be if they are DoSed for a longer period of time and cannot receive channel updates or broadcast penalty transactions.

He pays zero fees for his transactions :)
@_date: 2015-08-12 18:06:29


Actually it would work with larger fees from fewer transactions.
Anchor/redeeming transactions for the LN can have much larger fees, because in each payment channel there can be a lot of transactions taking place over a long period of time. This would make a per-transaction fee be a lot less than a single on-chain fee in a future where on-chain fees has become many times larger than what we have today.
For example if a channel has processed 1000 transactions and have required two on-chain transactions, each with a $1 fee, totaling $2 in on-chain fees, this would average out the fee for each LN transaction to 0.002$ per transaction.
As far as I see it, LN has a very good chance at becoming the scaling solution we desperately need. 
Note that I am not saying we should never increase the blocksize.
@_date: 2015-08-13 11:57:07
Seems like they want to put a bunch of other (related) soft-forks together with this one. CSV and CLTV are two of them, and they are (in my eyes at least) essential for LN. 
Further down the road transaction malleability will need to be fixed as well, to really make lightning shine.

Wouldn't Bitcoin be more resilient in such a scenario though? At least for people who aren't reusing addresses?
Since we only reveal the public key when we spend coins and assuming  our transaction is included in a block within a couple of hours after broadcasting, and that the broken ECDSA means that NSA could retrieve the private key from the public key within a week, then Bitcoin would still be pretty darn safe.
Worse for Proof-of-stake systems :P

Different timelocks will be chosen depending on what security you need. Just like you may be happy with zero-conf for low-value transfers on the blockchains and at least 6 confirmations on high-value transfers.


Just as vulnerable as with vanilla Bitcoin. By the time LN is deployed hopefully there will be functioning TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) that can be used to greatly mitigate an attacker stealing coins.


A solution explained in the same section by using third parties.

With the malleability fix you can trustlessly outsource the checking to multiple parties.

Bitcoins whitepaper doesn't provide many details of how the protocol operates. It is great to understand how it achieves distributed consensus, and is what got me hooked on Bitcoin 4 years ago. It took a long time to understand the inner workings of it though, and it was difficult back then to find good documentation on the protocol.
The lightning network is IMO the most interesting protocol since Bitcoin and I can't wait to see it deployed! The 59 page whitepaper is great if you want to understand the details of how it works. It is a lot better than the previous ~20-page whitepaper. Hopefully they will produce a ~10-page whitepaper that explains the greatness of the protocol, just like Satoshi's whitepaper.
If you are interested in seeing some of the protocol actually work in practice you can check out work so far.

Nothing wrong with off-chain indeed, but off-chain transactions are almost equivalent today with transactions made on a centralized service like changetip or coinbase.

@_date: 2016-09-09 19:14:29
You include consensus rules which says that miners need to commit to the state of the sidechain. Sure, they don't need to include any transactions of the sidechain, but they need to verify to be sure they don't build on top of invalid blocks. Same goes for segwit. Not mandatory for them to include segwit transactions, but mandatory for them to properly validate, unless they want to risk losing money.

The implications are many.
* Since they will continue calling segwit2x bitcoin, users will be fooled into sending real bitcoins and bitpay may claim to never have received them, since they are looking at a different chain
* Segwit2x is an attack on Bitcoin from multiple businesses in the hope to seize control of the network and its development. Up til now, Bitcoin Core have been updating the protocol based on consensus, while this new conglomerate are looking to upgrade the protocol as they see fit, including multiple block size increases which will result in more expensive to run full nodes, leading to less people being able to care for their financial self-sovereignty. 
* Just like the fork we saw on 1 Aug, this fork will dilute the Bitcoin brand further, making it increasingly difficult for newcomers to understand Bitcoin. As such, any business supporting this takeover attempt ought to be boycotted (and by extension, any businesses using the product and services of these businesses, e.g. Bitpay)

$5/$20 for opening/closing lightning channels is not so bad when those channels have performed thousands of transactions over their lifetime.
Medium-term, lightning will be great for Bitcoin scalability, and will help keep per-transaction fee low even if the on-blockchain fee is high.
@_date: 2015-09-04 15:56:10
There should be as much in transaction fees as possible. This does not  necessarily equal as many transactions as possible. 
If transactions can be almost as secure off-chain (lightning) as on-chain, then that is a big win for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-02 09:03:41
I doubt fees will reach those heights anytime soon, and when they do most people will probably be utilizing the lightning network (or something better) and being paid via it. 
I don't claim to know what the future holds, but I believe the lightning network will turn out to be a great addition to Bitcoin.
During its bootstrap (1-2 years from now?) fees will probably be low, because it is obvious that some agreement will be reached on the blocksize increase, and also we have the block subsidy. During this time experimentation will show what the best course of action will be.
Yes, multiple channels with multiple nodes is ideal to route past abusive ones.

If it turns out that channels will have to be renewed that often, perhaps you are right. I think that, eventually, channels will become so stable that they will be able to stay open for years.
One can also imagine a future where no other currency could be used, and the worker, as part of their employment, gets the channel setup paid for by the employer. 
There are so many directions this could take and, again, no one knows where this will land. All I can say is that, I personally, have high hopes for the lightning network. Perhaps you don't, and thats fine.

It is enough to find a path that can cover what you want to send. You could send it through a "hub" (which is a node, just like all other nodes on the network) with a lot of reserves, but what is bad with that? If they forward your payment: great! If they refuse you route around them!


I don't know why you are speculating that Blockstream will choose default paths for everyone. Thats just silly. If you follow the discussion on lightning-dev it seems like every lightning node will connect to some random amount of nodes when they join. It is all open source so it will be easy to verify. So unless they are using a faulty RNG to make it only pick Blockstream nodes this is just a baseless accusation and doesn't belong here.
There are also many other implementations of the lightning network. Blockstream are in no way alone in this.

With CLTV soon enabled one could create a script that allows the owner to spend whenever she wants OR the heirs to spend after a year or some other timeout. The heirs spending condition could be reused every time the owner sends change back to herself. If MAST is ever implemented, the heirs spending condition would never have to be revealed for every spend the owner makes.
@_date: 2015-10-29 08:11:16
No trust necessary in them. You just provide them with the transaction signed and ready with the amount you allow them to take of the counterpartys funds, if he would try to cheat. They cannot change any detail of the transaction. They just broadcast it if they find that it becomes spendable.
Haven't really thought about it from a privacy point of view though... I don't think it is so bad, since it is only regular Bitcoin transactions you send out and you get the same privacy as you have today since all bitcoin transactions are public. If you want privacy you would have to skip this outsourcing I guess and do it yourself, or just choose a few that you deem trustworthy to not forward them to other people.
Edit: I guess you need to trust them to broadcast it, but if you incentivize them enough and give it to a lot of third parties so they have to compete over it, I don't think it will be a problem.
@_date: 2015-10-29 07:36:02


This is incorrect. When transaction malleability is solved the user can outsource the "stealing" of the cheating party funds by incentivizing those third parties with a nice chunk of the cheaters funds. So even if the user is offline there will be multiple parties competing to "steal" the cheaters funds, while at the same time giving the non-cheating party his own funds+much of cheaters funds. Most likely miners will take on this role.

Probably based on the fact that a hard fork is not gonna happen anytime soon. If you want to hard fork so badly, you should go along with the guys who will fork unconditionally and join their altcoin.
Several wallets and libraries are ready for segwit according to  and many more are work in progress.
Do you really think there is another option that will provide a capacity increase faster than segwit?

Looks like F2Pool, BW Pool, KnCMiner, GHash.IO and partly BitFury are the ones mining v4 blocks right now.

In addition to CLTV we would need CSV (kind of a relative CLTV). And further down the line fix malleability, but this isn't strictly necessary to get a functioning LN deployed.

Thats true. I assuem that he had his own laptop as well. He could have moved the binaries to his own laptop to verify them before installing.
If he just downloaded installed and followed along Craig's instructions without asking any questions or doing due diligence, I am going to be very disappointed. 
He should also have checked what root certificates were installed on it. Made sure that the certificate of the website presented on the new laptop was the same as the one on his own laptop. There is a lot he can do to eliminate doubt.
Maybe he did all this, but he has been awfully quiet...

It would be very strange if he said that he didn't.

I think this will solve the recent malleability attack: 
Test LowS in standardness, removes nuisance malleability vector.

It would not be included in a block. It would be settled in the LN channel. The prover would only broadcast the transaction if the verifier refuses to settle the channel or goes offline for whatever reason, like all lightning payments.
@_date: 2015-11-13 15:05:54
They can refuse to accept it as valid payment. Perhaps they are nice enough to give you a refund transaction that you can spend after the timeout minus a juicy administrative fee.

BIP100 and 102 are Jeff's creations. The "and more" probably implies he has yet another proposal. He has nothing to do with BIP101, which is why it is not in the title.

Following the lightning-dev mailing list, I can say that all parties are cooperating a lot to make sure they are inter-operable.

Yes, its pretty clear that it is for microtransactions primarily. As the technology matures, perhaps its not unreasonable to start using it for larger amounts. It will be interesting to see.


I wonder if it would be possible to use confidential transactions here to not reveal the values until someone actually cheats and the transaction becomes spendable. This could be a huge benefit for privacy as the cash flow is never revealed, but I don't know CT well enough. Could this work @_date: 2016-05-03 05:54:49
Considering they connected from a fresh laptop that had never visited the electrum webpage previously, they could also strip the unencrypted HTTP header of the necessary information to signal HSTS.
I doubt they used SSLStrip though. Wouldn't have noted that he was downloading from a unauthenticated webpage (although, at this moment, nothing will surprise me)? They make it pretty obvious nowadays. 
My guess is they had the "fresh" laptop prepped with one of their own CA certificates. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 15:28:51
I believe raising the block size will be necessary, but if LN is successful the block size will only need to be a fraction of what it would have to be  if all transactions were on the chain.
@_date: 2015-02-16 18:51:52
Yes, fixed. Sorry about that :)
@_date: 2015-10-29 11:33:37
I was wondering if CT could be used to hide the amounts from third parties that you outsource for the stealing of the cheaters funds. These third parties wouldn't necessarily be part of any of the payment paths, but they would receive signed transactions that could be spent if the counterparty broadcasts a revoked transaction. So the question is: Can CT be used to hide the amounts of these transactions from those third parties and only allow them to verify the transaction once it becomes spendable? This would require that the proof that the amounts are in range are included in the revoked transaction. Is this the case?
@_date: 2015-02-17 14:40:05
Not too quickly I hope. Since this would be a hard fork, everyone (not just the miners) would need to be on board.

Why would he need to move coins at all, when all he has to do is sign a message with the key and publish it? Also, moving coins from an early block is bad proof as he long ago said that he was an early miner. Genesis block key signature is necessary.

Lightning may actually help create an incentive for users to support SPV nodes. There was a discussion on the lightning-dev mailing list a while back about an opcode OP_CHECKSPVPROOFVERIFY where a node could collect payment upon proving that a transaction was included in a block.

I didn't realize this was the case. Its a shame to see segwit postponed. Will they not activate BIP68/112/113 until hard fork code is available either?
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:20:39
When CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY is introduced, a script which says that his children can spend it at some point in time OR he can spend it himself (with no time constraints). Updating this transaction would be trivial and could reuse the childrens keys without any problems.

You should test the randomness of the dice. Roll them all a couple of thousand times and see if there is any significant bias towards any digit :)

Running from a VPN is not always adviseable, since you don't always now if the VPN provider is trustworthy. I would prefer to chain several VPNs, just as tor works, to eliminate single points of failure. 
I trust my ISP more than any VPN provider though.

I believe they stopped identifying themselves in blocks a while back, meaning they are part of the unknown group of miners. Around 1%

I think the unknown hashrate grew when they stopped identifying themselves, but yeah, they could have moved to another pool, though I dont't believe this is the case.

Only broadcasting my own transactions, and no others, would jeopardize my financial privacy. Similarly, when only listening I will tell the nodes I listen from what addresses I want to receive information on, again hurting my financial privacy.

My incentive for running a full node is that I can connect to it with my SPV wallet and ensure full privacy and security. That is enough incentive for me to do it.
