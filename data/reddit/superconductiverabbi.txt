You want to pay $100 for something today only to realize tomorrow that you'd have $200 if you just hadn't bought that thing?

Perhaps they do own a house. The point still stands that they'd have two houses now instead of one.

I don't know enough about currency to say, but this sounds like it has the ring of truth.

How much BTC is in circulation? The market volume of BTC is massive...$3.8 billion dollars a day. You're saying that BTC as a currency is used in some similarly large volume?


If you're sure that your savings will double tomorrow then use USD and save your BTC, or buy more BTC. No one ever says to buy more USD.

You're not describing opportunity cost, you're describing the risk you assume when you use a fiat currency or investment. And the risk is directly proportional to the security's volatility.
The risk of halving your value in USD tomorrow is infinitesimally small; if you don't believe me, go to forex and buy calls for a rise of **$0.03 EUR/USD over one month**. You could buy that call for 2/5ths of one penny.
Options don't exist for BTC as far as I know, but just look at the volatility over any time period you wish. It's akin to a super high risk conventional investment vehicle. Again, making one call into question the wisdom of using it as a currency rather than just buying and trading BTC directly.

They said this when it was 100 BTC/USD. No one knows where it'll plateau, but once it seems to go into the useful-as-currency-phase you'd think that everyone holding onto it as an investment would ditch it, thus driving the price down and making it less useful as a currency. That correction would then make on-the-fence investors buy it up, and so on.

What are the two variables in the case of it being a correlation? Volatility is the measurement of the investment's price varying over time. A correlation describes the relationship between two investments or other variables. I'm not describing the correlation between BTC and USD, I'm describing the value of BTC/USD over time and how stable or unstable it is.

It doesn't require hindsight to see that it's likely the value of BTC will vary widely. It just requires an understanding that it's volatile
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:29:40
But I'm not talking about the correlation between BTC and USD, I'm talking about the volatility. I don't care if USD increases and BTC decreases, or if BTC decreases and USD stays the same. I care about whether the value of BTC/USD today is likely to be much higher tomorrow, which it is.

I'm not asking where you can spend Bitcoins
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:53:16
It's a matter of probabilities and yet you don't know the probability of USD vs BTC changing over time, which is called volatility.

People that bought pizzas with BTCs could have bought houses had they held onto it. This indicates it's useful as an investment vehicle, but until that variability drops down to levels similar to currency, what use is it as currency?
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:38:45
The β of USD is near-zero. You're presupposing that it's equally likely that USD and BSD will lose half their value in a day. Only one of those two currencies is even remotely likely to do that.
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:08:17


USD is backed by the economic and military might of the US government: the bet that tomorrow the US is going to be pretty much the same as today. 


Possibly yes, but there were people saying that this was happening at 100 BTC/USD, as it plateaued there for a while. No one knows where the ceiling is (and if they did, they'd make a fortune).


Because if I pay 1 BTC for something today, I don't want to kick myself in the ass tomorrow by realizing that I could've waited a day and paid 0.5 BTC. It'd be like buying a house and then tomorrow all your neighbors suddenly become meth addicts; had you waited one more day you could've bought the property for half the amount you spent. This is summed up as volatility, and high volatility is good as a high-risk investment, but not usually what you want in a currency.
Thanks for giving the best answer in the thread so far, though. You used more compelling arguments.
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:39:40
It is if you don't understand the first thing about what backs the US dollar, and purposefully ignore BTC's volatility. 
And if you don't understand these things how can you use it?

Can I recommend that you get the Bitcoin symbol in as fast as possible? It should probably appear first somehow, not last. The animation shouldn't be about revealing a mystery, it should look cool *and* communicate the information as well as the static image.

You can go crazy trying to predict what BTC will do. When it was $1.00 plenty of people were eagerly waiting for a panic sell so they could buy back in at that now-extremely-tempting price of $0.50. Then when it jumped to $9 they were kicking themselves and tearing their hair out at how stupid they felt they had been.
Anyway, good job with the animation!
