Most people elect to convert to their favorite fiat, and pay the fees involved, when they don't need to.  Certainly there is something we can all find to use bitcoins to exchange for directly, and the more we try, they more we'll find, until those fees aren't necessary.
It's a point of centralization we should *try* to avoid whenever we can which will benefit bitcoin tremendously.

They're not problems that were essential to fix.  Bitcoin didn't need to solve every problem, but it does solve problems that had no solutions before.  Make it better, sure..  but don't lose track of what is essential.  Permissionless, &amp; decentralization at any cost is a miracle when you imagine the world without them again.  It'll get cheaper in time, but we can never risk losing it.
Which is the point of the FUD.  Convince us to consider losing it.  Sufficiently decentralized, that's all they've got; convince us to sabotage it ourselves.

No, but it does show why risking this once in a lifetime, successful, decentralized, cryptocurrency, is insane, and unnecessary!  Even if gift cards, or debit cards, weren't an option, risking what didn't exist, &amp; likely couldn't be recreated if we lost it, for "cups of coffee", when we've made it this far without a CC solving the "cups of coffee", is ludicrous!
We've got something that we could only dream of 7 years ago.  It's here.  It works.  It's successful.  if you think you can do better, try to supplant it, but do not risk it!  I realize that altering bitcoin has always been a thing, but I know bitcoins adversaries very well.  They will convince us to make it vulnerable if it isn't already.  If every person on the planet can't buy coffee throughout the day with BTC, so be it!  Make something that will allow people to do it.  Bitcoin, as is, is the spine of hope for liberty!  Do not risk it!!

This makes me sick. I hope that a CC eventually has the ability to be recovered from thieves. I know this is unlikely, but so are CCs.
I hope that people devise some way to do this. I was thinking of the possibility of giving someone you trust your wallet, with the job of emptying it under some circumstances. At the very least I hope people have access to a backup, and might be able to move it themselves before thieves can access their CC.
I wonder if it wouldn't be possible to have a long term storage option that could recall CC before a set amount of time. Or if it could only send to one, companion, wallet/address. I don't know. I'm sure you brilliant bastards will come up with something eventually. I look forward to it.
Edit - Could it be possible to identify the address/es, and collectively decide to nullify the theft? I guess there would have to be somewhere to send/restore the BTCs to even if that was possible. Maybe someday we BTC users can identify the address/es of a criminal state, extract the CC, and add it to the next mining reward.. Like when you add fees to the free parking reward in Monopoly.  lol

I don't understand the technicalities of it to describe it well, but it was essentially a screen saver that the SETI Project offered to allow people to crunch numbers &amp; help the project out remotely. Perhaps someone else could describe it better?

I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I assume the same place it comes from now.
Also, if bitcoin isn't "money", than neither are FRNs. What you're talking about is legal tender. Give me enough BTCs, and I'll exchange for enough legal tender to pay off whatever extortion is necessary, or give them to someone else in exchange for paying off whatever extortion is necessary.
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:17:55
I don't think BTC, the inflation hedge store of value, or the money transferability, will have any trouble surviving.  I think that the exchangers may eventually be driven away from BTC.
That won't be a bad thing, as much as it may decrease the "exchange rate" from what it has been.
All BTC has to do is incorporate privacy/anonymity features before another CC that has these features surpasses it, and it's not going anywhere for a very long time.

They're looking for things with intrinsic value. If you buy cars, and furniture, they can be used for transport, or sitting, as well as barter.  If you buy gold, you can use it for circuitry, or filling a cavity in a tooth, &amp; barter.  If you exchange for BTC...  well, you can barter with it, but if times get tough, peoples' priority shifts to survival first, and wealth preservation is more of a luxury.  If they're not afraid of harsh reality times coming, I'd be exchanging for BTC too (perhaps only a limited amount of gold, because it makes you a target, and it's hard to move with it securely).  If they are, I'd be buying at least a gun, and as much ammo as I could.  If Russians fear post Soviet Union type times ahead, they should leave if they can (which is where BTC is excellent), &amp; buy as much ammo as possible if they can't.  Ammo is probably the greatest combination of barter &amp; tool.

I assume that it could made with the ability to rein it in so that it didn't cook your computer. No?


Could you elaborate? Could you describe approx the hash per 100k systems running a screen saver like this?


I think you're very wrong there. I think that exponentially more people than those mining now would be interested in something like this if it were simple enough. What I don't know is if that would amount to anything significant.
This seemed to me like a relatively quick way to strengthen the network *a bit*. It certainly wouldn't solve the problem, but if it added 3% quickly, it could buy some time, and also help the P2P pool get going. I don't know what it would take to build this screen saver concept, but I assumed it wouldn't take much time.

Technology moves fast.  I think you need to decide for yourself which is the most valuable to you, most valuable to everyone, and most likely to be here in 18 months.  BTC the currency may hold up in 18 months, but it should be replaced by something superior in 18 years.  Eventually the network itself will likely be replaced.
As far as CCs are concerned, it's not something you want to file away for decades down the road because it should be replaced by something better.  As Andreas has mentioned, BTC doesn't have to be the best option, because it works, and it was first.  The size of the network, and the amount of people using it, makes BTC the best CC available currently.
If it helps, think of BTC as the technology, and network, the currency exists on.  If you think of the currency as Satoshis, you can buy a lot more Satoshis than you can Litecoin (though, obviously, you can buy a lot more of the smallest unit of Litecoin because they're less valuable).
Do you want your $600 in copper, nickel, silver, or gold?  It's still $600 worth.  Sometimes it's advantageous to go with the second biggest.  For example, if hackers focus their efforts on stealing peoples' wallets, it might be advantageous to go with Nextcoin which works very differently, and the hacker's malware wouldn't find a wallet.  I'm sure that Nextcoin could be exploited too, but you assume a criminal looks for the largest pool of wealth/victims to focus on, rather than a niche.
Having said all of that, I believe that BTC is the best store of value today.  I also believe that if BTC doesn't incorporate privacy/anonymity advancements, then it will be much shorter lived than it should be.  Unlike gold, which you *probably* don't have to worry about the value of if you wanted to bury for 30 years, you need to follow the tech so you don't get left behind when it comes to CCs.

Worth less, but not worthless.  Arguably would be the best thing for a CC to eliminate exchanges, and "legitimate businesses" from using it, and have an incredibly slow growth through individuals use.  It's to bad it wasn't a garage sale, friend reimbursement, type medium of exchange for a decade or more.  It's value would be best on market consensus over a slow adoption period, rather than rapid growth, and a money transfer tool.
Inevitably the next currency will crash, and many of the people saddled with it will turn to BTC.  The first time this happens things will change forever, and as you said, there main reason for this is the controlled, finite, inflation.

I'm not sure how else to say it.  Think decentralization.  The closer you are to dealing with individuals, the better.  Individuals will of course be attacked by the state, but likely after the points of centralization.  Why?  Exchanges are an attractive target for the state.. because they exist at the behest of the state, they will accomodate any demand, or in rare cases like Lavabit, call it a day.  Those that persist will do as they're told.  They'll collect tons of intel for the state.  They'll turn BTCs from a largely uncontrollable, freeing, tech, into the exact opposite.  Dependence on something that is dependent upon the state means you're just being routed back in the normal avenues of things.  In this case, BTC is far worse than other options.
Also, it's just simply inefficient.  Why go through an unnecessary step if you don't need?  If people in Mexico understood that they could accept, and exchange, BTC for what they needed, these ATMs would be worthless.  They'd grant no substantial intel, as they're unnecessary.
BTC isn't just an investment.  It's not just a payment system.  It's a lot of different things..  but our perspectives can allow it to be pigeon holed into smaller roles, and in fact potentially be a plague on humanity as an ultimate surveillance tool.
The silliest thing is observing two associates, one using an exchange service to acquire BTC, while the other is looking to sell using another service.  Find real individuals when possible to facilitate your transactions.  Think decentralization in all things!
Edit:  Let me put it another way...
A brilliant man once told me that no one wants money.  He said that if you find someone who mistakenly thinks they want money, and you tell them that hypothetically you're going to give them a huge bag of their favorite money, &amp; a year later you'll visit them, and then you both can look at the bag of money they value so greatly, will all of the money still be there?  Their answer is, of course not.  Then you can finally discover what they truly wanted, which is food, gas, debt relief, etc..
If we're not lazy, we can cut to the chase with BTC (or any other barter), and cut the system out of our transactions.
If that doesn't strike a chord, imagine it this way...  BTC was created by a state..  lets say Japan for the heck of it.  It's legal tender.  It has all the technological, and economic, benefits it currently does, but now it's "real money" that doesn't need to be exchanged for any other "real money".  As I said, there is no such thing as universally acceptable money.  The only reason there are regions stuck with legal tender is because there are gangs of people with guns who force those in their turf to accept it.  As long as exchanging anything other than legal tender is allowed (or just done regardless of it being allowed), BTC doesn't need to be exchanged to other money often..  and when it does, it's efficient, and advantageous, to do so with an individual.

There are two types of people in this world; ones that think something has ever gone wrong with bitcoin, and ones that know that nothing has ever gone wrong with bitcoin, and likely can't.  You're speaking about things going wrong associated with bitcoin, but which isn't bitcoin itself.
I see two scenarios where I'll be done with BTC..  The most likely of which is a successor allowing for greater privacy/anonymity.  The largest CC to get this right first will likely be the primary CC for the foreseeable future until some new innovation surpasses it.
The less likely scenario is that enough developers turn away from what BTC is, to turn it into something useless..  To alter it from a liberating tool, to an enslaving one, to make it more appealing to their masters.

Tipping them years later after a discussion with their buddy about some experience with particularly appreciated service.  Etc..
As we all know, one of the benefits of having a bitcoin address is that it allows for infinite incoming revenue after only one exposure, regardless if the address owner is working, asleep, on the other side of the world, etc..
I assume that dancers, models, cam girls, massage therapists, sex workers, waitresses, musicians, motivational speakers, &amp; so on, could really benefit from handing their client a business card with their BTC address, &amp; their website (which of course has the BTC address on it, too).
My understanding of how many dancers work is that they pay the house to work for an evening, and then they keep the tips.  I would think that this would benefit the house, too, as having tiny women leave with less/no cash in the middle of the night results in a more secure environment for their dancers.
Edit:  I had to run earlier, &amp; I wanted to mention a few of the endless possibilities with BTCs..  A place of business could put up one of those signs that say "Employees have no access to timed safe.", or "None of our employees leave with cash."  A manager could provide space to an ATM owner, &amp; provide their employees the option of keeping BTCs, exchanging for cash, exchanging cash for BTCs before leaving in the middle of the night, and coming back whenever they feel safest to get cash if they feel the need.
BTCs can't have drug residue on them, or be considered evidence.  With the right strategies, BTCs are raid resistant/proof.  If a business shared tips, the manager could have an address for each employee, and divvy it up per their arrangement, verifiable to everyone.  I assume a relatively cheap, pager like, device could be used as a view only wallet, so they service provider could confirm payment without having anything that could be taken (short of them themself) that could be used to steal the BTCs from their wallet.

That's just not true.  5, or sadly more, people smashing their iPhones will very likely be an effective way to get more attention than would many others without iPhones being smashed.  Like it or not, agree with it or not, this will resonate with some people.
I get that people don't like the waste, and I wouldn't have chosen to go about it this way, but this sort of falls into the category of activism that someone is willing to do where any criticism is nearly irrelevant.  Yes, it's good to get input, and refine any strategy, but generally speaking I appreciate anyone willing to actually do something, and would tell the critics that to lead by example.

Agreed. The purpose of the state, or at least the premise for it, is to protect the "citizens" rights, and uphold justice.  In reality it's a system of slavery &amp; theft.  That they betray this responsibility partnering with other criminals makes them the worst possible criminals imho.  If the state served its purpose, and the first criminal was arrested when they came looking to buy protection, things would be very different.

One of his points was about abundance.  If it rained every day, and everyone lived in Earthships, the "intrinsic value" of water would be irrelevant due to the fact that their might as well be an infinite amount for practical purposes.
Speaking of Earthships, there's another example of how decentralization means greater security, and independence. Not only for water, waste, electricity, and food, at the individual level, but for the community, as there would be a "meshnet" effect of the surrounding Earthships helped out the ones with failing systems.
"Money" is a medium of exchange.  Intrinsic value is unnecessary.  If people wanted to barter only in things with intrinsic value, they could use ammunition.  Or eggs.  Or tools.  That's not the point of money, however.  The point is to have a convenient medium to exchange for those things you need or want. BTC certainly is convenient.  Arguably, the point of money is to relieve the slave owners from the limitations of chattel slavery, and allow for a much simpler, all encompassing, slavery through tax/inflation.  Whatever..  The real point he was making is that it's valuable because people use it, and he is correct.
Edit:  I recommend that people not sell BTCs whenever possible, but "purchase" something with them, if they wish to move from BTCs, to something else. I wish BTC didn't have "coin" in the title, was never seen as money, but considered a type of super convenient, global, barter credit only to be exchanged, but not "bought" &amp; "sold". This is one of the reasons statists have taken notice, and one of the reasons people pay too much attention to the exchange rate.  As I've said before, if you're waiting for BTC to be successful, you're missing the boat.  It is successful.  Hopefully it will continue to be.

I've not read anything about the XBox, or XBox 360.  I was only referring to the XBox One.  What I've read said that it wouldn't work without both cameras, multiple mics, some sensor, and originally an internet connection, though apparently they changed that last one.
Playing games that require mics &amp;/or cameras is fine.  Having a surveillance device able to collect all kinds of data in the middle of your house 24/7, when there are many other options which aren't nearly as bad, and I believe they all play the same games...  I just don't get it.
None of that really matters, though.  It doesn't matter that I wouldn't have it.  I wanted the Bitcoin community to remember what the XBox One is, and really consider if they'd like to support MS by purchasing it, rather than any of their other numerous products.  If you're aware, &amp; have considered it, and still decide to have one in your house, so be it.  I just hope people don't buy them for their kids without understanding what it is.  It doesn't surprise me that kids don't care about the ramifications, but I don't know how anyone who considers it would conclude that the XBox One is the option for them.

This is a horrible notion.  Ok, perhaps not so horrible for "newbies"..  However, new miners will perpetually be needed.  Warn newcomers that they shouldn't expect to make profits.  Warn them that their efforts will be minuscule, &amp; their equipment will grow even more small every day after the first... but please stop telling people not to mine, especially when they beg for help to learn how to mine.
CCs are doomed to centralization/corruption if they don't incentivize as many people as possible to work to secure it.  It was a huge mistake to separate the node/mining from the client.  It doesn't matter how small, but having billions of contributors would have been a good thing.  It should have been made easier for people to node/work.  Even if just a simple background, screen saver, type option like the old SETI.
You can claim it doesn't matter, but I can tell you this..  the network would only be made more secure by having most everyone using BTCs work in the network.  The entities who would like to convince you the most that it's pointless to contribute are the ones most involved in the mining race, and those who wish they were.

After multiple red flags without getting out, you're not doing yourself, or anyone else, any favors to pretend that you didn't have a hand in it.
Learn from your mistake, and next time you see red flags, realize that BTC is a tool for adults.  This isn't a nanny state game where other people will insulate you from your poor decisions.

"After today's NSA revelations, who in their right mind would trust an always-on Microsoft-controlled Xbox camera in their living room?"
Let's pretend that you just want to play video games specifically on the XBox One, and not any of the other systems, and you don't mind it monitoring all the sounds, faces, heart rates, in your living room...  How many parents who perhaps discuss private, or sensitive business info, are aware that their silly kid put the Surveillance Box in the middle of their house?  How many girlfriends understand that when they come watch a movie next to you on the couch that they're constantly being watched, heard, and recognized, even in the dark?

It's not the abuse of power that's the problem, but the power to abuse.

This is decentralization.


Not if every neighbor you have is growing their own crops.  Then you're less "fucked" than you would be with any 10,000 farms that aren't local to you.
If you can imagine a community of people who are off grid, and produce 110% or more of what they need in electricity, water, waste disposal, communication, &amp; food, then not only are you not dependent on your crops, but you could transact with a dozen neighbors within walking distance until you recover from whatever it was that caused the failure.  Some people would produce less than 100% of what they need, and deal for the rest, and others would produce 1000%, or more, of what they need.
Now imagine food supply was truly centralized, and it is corrupted.  [Look at the images of the meshnet nodes vs the centralized model]( replace communication with anything else, and you can easily see which is most fragile, and which offers the most redundancy, and resiliency.

However, for some reason, half way through your comment it occurred to me that an iPhone could be used to get someone access to BTCs, and that perhaps jailbreaking, adding a client, and donating, would have been more productive (but maybe not).
It's too bad that there is no linux distro really running on iPhone that I know of.

It's not a currency.  You're not buying &amp; selling with it, but exchanging.  Value is subjective, and it doesn't matter.

Bitcoin is about decentralization, and the rights of the individual. There may be plenty of people who like a central authority to take care of things they don't wish to in many aspects of life, but who are still interested in bitcoin, or CCs, for whatever reason. Maybe it's just profit.. Maybe because they think it's neat. My point is, that's fine, but everyone needs to remember what bitcoin is, and the point of bitcoin, and that's  not to be acceptable to a supposed authority. It's to have no central authority, and leave the power of the property with those who possess it. I read too many discussions about people trying, or suggesting, to make BTC something other than what it is, and is meant to be.
If BTC can't stand up to those who are displeased with it, it's not what we think/thought it was. There will be a next evolution that will be able to hold. The point isn't to make it more appealing to those who steal &amp; destroy money, but to make it resistant to them.

I understand why Gox would do it.  Actually regain as many of the BTC that they owe, at a price they can afford.  Anyone who sells loses any claim against them as they agreed to the compensation, and were compensated.  I guess it could be argued that it was almost extorted, or under duress, but assuming they're going to be sued, I would bet that those who sell at any price, and who are paid, will not be considered to have a stake in the matter.

If Bitcoin Foundation were only useless, I wouldn't mind it so much, but it's detrimental.  It already has been, but even if you're under the impression that it hasn't yet been, it's only a matter of time.  Any central influence will eventually be corrupted and used to discredit BTC, and create FUD.  We should resist, and denounce, any attempt to cultivate a central spokesperson, or authority, on the matter of BTC.  It's one thing for someone to be a trusted advocate, or teacher, but the moment they're perceived as speaking for anyone other than themselves, or having any authority over BTC, they become a tool for those who wish to eliminate BTC.
We should think decentralization in all things.
Having said all that, it doesn't really matter..  Either BTC can weather many people doing exactly the wrong things around it, or it's not what we think it is.

At the end of the day, the state can take whatever it wants. It has a monopoly on terrorism in its territory.  It demands a cut from any business in its turf.  If you don't pay, you don't play.  Politicians/state agents sell their influence to the highest bidder.  The only thing keeping them from doing anything aside from what that bidder wants is that it results in the most amount of money/control.  They can &amp; will take whatever whenever if it nets more.  There is no non-state institution that couldn't be completely dismantled by the state if for whatever reason those with the most influence decided it was beneficial.
The banks exist at the behest of the state.  If the members of state weren't criminal, they'd stop the criminal bankers, and we'd have a just system..  lol.  but we have a criminal state, and it's hard to outbid bankers, so it looks like they're in charge.  If banks were to become obsolete, or just become far less effective thieving, intel harvesting, control mechanisms, you'd find that it would result in a greater gain for the criminals in the state to hang em out to dry.
It looks like we disagree.

It would be beneficial to have a record of the business practices of the individual from other individuals who have done business with them (and what their business practices have been), and not just the reputation of a institution (which today is more like a rumor, which isn't updated instantly, and with *every* transaction.. something far less meaningful than what we're talking about) . If someone can influence your business/money, knowing who they are, and their track record, is beneficial, and unlike what we have now.
If someone became an escrow agent 4 years ago, and had 30 people renown in the BTC community state that they performed perfectly, of course you'd rather deal with them *if you needed to* than an unknown. Of course a trustless option would be superior.  If an agent had 20,000 ratings, and 19,997 of them were perfect, and 3 of them were critical (by 3 people who were critical of everyone, and who had poor reps themselves), that agent, if available, is a factor you could have as much faith in as your hardware/software, etc..  There is not a bank out there, regardless of the companies reputation, that couldn't have an incompetent, disgruntled, negligent, employee cause trouble, and if they did the vast majority of people wouldn't know about it.  One of the purposes of a "company" is to insulate the individuals involved from some level of accountability.

Here's one thing I've been thinking, and almost expected before Mt Gox finally went away for the most part...  If he wanted to steal everyone's funds, and disappear, waiting a few more months for Zerocoin/cash may have been a more strategically sound way of achieving that than what has happened.
Now, if he cut a deal with some government, and their perspective is the more harm that can come to BTC users the better..  I guess there are some other options.
Maybe there is still some some silver lining we haven't yet been made aware of.  Regardless, people must insist that they be in control of their coins going forward.  Think BTC-e is shady?  Well get your funds out of there before Zerocoin is available.  It's not that it's necessary for them to steal from you, but it could make it a lot easier for them to steal from you, and access the funds, and no one have a clue about it.
I don't mean to pick on BTC-e.  We need those algorithmic solutions, &amp; we need to only use those who incorporate them, asap.

Personal financial gain is a small factor in my interest in BTC.  Also, I believe BTCs are worth more than they've ever sold for.  If BTCs leave my possession it's not for financial reasons.
Assuming BTCs solve the anonymity/privacy issues, they're simply worth a lot more than anyone is willing to pay me for them.  I will exchange out of BTCs when I'm made an offer of something I can immediately exchange back into more BTCs than I gave up.  Otherwise, not interested.

I imagine BTC allowing regions of very poor people with access to electricity, and a cell signal, to become wealthier than they ever have been before, in a matter of years..  and completely ignorant people like this clamoring for regulation, because now the inequality among the people in these societies is more stark, even though 99.9% of them are exponentially better off.  They manage to give their favorite rich, white, male, parasite the political clout necessary to steal a good portion of their wealth..  and with their poverty restored, the inequality isn't as noticeable, and these ignorant horror shows pat themselves on the back for what they've accomplished.. Believing returning these people to poverty has rescued them from BTC taking advantage of them.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:09:54
Yes, but one everyone had better pay attention to. For the most part people don't care what others credit score is, unless they're lending them money, or renting to them. On a daily basis people are the first to trust without and consideration for a credit score. They hand a cashier cash before they get their product/service, or vice versa, &amp; it never crosses anyone's mind to consider a credit score before doing it.
How great it would be to have a list of 100 arbiters/escrow agents with perfect credit, or rep, rating? With any transaction the two parties could just find an escrow agent they're both comfortable with, and suddenly life is a lot easier.

I think too many of you are thinking of BTC as a profit scheme rather than the success it already is today, and will be for as long as there is electricity, internet, &amp; no successor.  BTC needs nothing except to implement privacy/anonymity innovations.
I don't want any few representatives that can be used to create FUD.  Any decentralized solution to something a statist can normally grow power from will be given an "official" face to try to make it as ineffective as possible.  Bitcoin doesn't need a foundation.  It doesn't need PR.  People with sound money will be better off than people without, and that will be all that's necessary for it to grow more &amp; more effective.


Couldn't disagree more.  Antonopoulos is great.  I appreciate the hell out of him.  The only "hope" for BTC is privacy, or it will be replaced.  *We don't need any one person.*  We need the network of BTC users to continue to evolve, &amp; strengthen, with innovation.

He's probably referring to the fact that the exchanges are points of centralization, and now the state's coloring/marking tool.  Also, the exchange rate, and then the exchangers, confuse people into thinking that it's a money transfer tool, and not a currency, or commodity.  Once all the legal tender currently in circulation has largely stopped being used, there will be gold, silver, ammunition, eggs, water, bread, and some sort of cryptomedium of exchange.  From that perspective, the unnecessary, and damaging, nature of the exchanges is more obvious.
If people considered BTC a decentralized, global, barter, credit, to be exchanged, rather than "purchasing" with them, it likely wouldn't be treated the way it is now by government, at least for a while longer.
If CCs were used as a medium of exchange by individuals not exchanging for a profit, we'd be interested in knowing how many eggs, ammo, or gas we can buy with them, and the dollar could continue to plummet, or do whatever.. continue to be irrelevant, but with people recognizing it.  The exchange rate/exchanging, and adoption period, confuses people as to what the value of BTC really is.  If I snapped my fingers and all other forms of "currency" disappeared, along with the exchangers, BTC would be a lot more valuable, and not just because it would have less competition as a convenient medium of exchange.  People would base the value on how much gold, ammo, oil, land, they could get in exchange for BTCs, and it wouldn't be volatile at all.  Once the market had figured it out, it would be basically "set", and the value would likely be tied to the population.
It's as if someone gave us steak, and many of us figured it should be used as a tray to carry crap "fast food" around with.  Yeah, that's a possible use...  but far from optimum.  A waste.
If someone could create a "CC", or crypto-medium-of-exchange, that couldn't be "sold", but only exchanged by individuals with other individuals, adoption would be slow, it would take a while to figure out the consensus on value, but it would be much better off in the long run.

It means that if you're relying on the local gang to respect your property rights, it's not going to work.  Maybe we're another invention away from the type of exchanging that people have wanted to do, but BTC is really not dependent on it.
Perhaps all of the exchangers will drop out at some point, the "exchange rate" will fall, and it will become the digital barter credit it was meant to be.
However, we're dealing with what's a pseudo free market, with the whole globe incentivized to come up with a solution.  I suspect that if there isn't a solution today, there will be one soon.

I gotcha..  I wish I had some ideas.  I was wondering if maybe a decentralized exchange could be made, and digital funds of all sorts could be exchanged.. Like gift card codes.  I don't know how a decentralized exchange might work, but I assume it would be easier to create one that works with other digital credit/property.

If that's the case, it's the end of centralized exchanges.  Or, at least it should be, as they're just agents for the state to color/collect BTC.
It's looking like BTC is going to be for individuals, or businesses that don't have a physical location to dominate.
@_date: 2014-03-15 20:27:56


Most do.  Some do not.  This is my point, though.  When those who do care about the principles are too outnumbered by those who don't, then BTC will go in whatever direction they wish it too, and we'll be on to plan C.  I'd like to postpone that for as long as possible.
As long as the principled keep providing sound, algorithmic, cheaper, alternatives, the money will follow.  When the only voices we hear are suggesting statist "solutions", it's game over.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:43:22
I've heard people suggest that no one keeps BTCs, they immediately transfer into FRNs.  I've asked someone with this perspective where they think the BTCs go.  It's not like they disappear.  The only way someone can transfer out of them into FRNs is because there are people who transfer out of FRNs to get into BTC.  The BTCs exist even after you've exchanged them for your favorite legal tender, and someone must hold them.
I've never exchanged BTCs for FRNs, but that doesn't mean FRNs aren't a currency to me because I use them to transfer into other things I want.  They're both mediums of exchange, and that's the point of them both.

I don't know enough about either to offer an opinion.  I'd much rather pay the price Ledger is asking, of course.  One thing I don't understand is why any non-open source thing would ever be considered an option.  Again, perhaps it's my limited understanding, but one thing I thought I had down is, if it's closed source, it's not an option.

The problem with altering bitcoin from the working cc it currently is, is that we run the risk of losing it to corrupting forces.  There was a time when devs could discuss what, and why, etc., come to a conclusion, and make an alteration.  The problem is, even if things are completely above board, there is no way all of us can know this.  What we do know is that establishment forces will want it corrupted.
I don't know what the solution is, but I hope we can figure one out.

I understand what you mean.
Andreas is for team free humanity over the Dominion.  He's definitely pro bitcoin.  He's more so pro freedom.  He'll be pro Bitcoin as long as it's its role to be the  CC, and he'd be pro Bitcoin jumping on the grenade of tyranny &amp; corruption to protect its successor/s if it comes to that..  though being that he's pro bitcoin, and constantly reminding us of how important network effect is, I think he'd tell you Bitcoin will always be the most effective CC route to freedom &amp; independence.. at least until Bitcoin is no longer the largest market cap, AND the largest hash rate (though it's possible some new tech that didn't require those things to stay viable could come along).  He's more pro freedom than pro CC, and he's more pro CC than he is pro bitcoin.  He also happens to have his entirely livelyhood, by that I mean his career &amp; finances, invested in Bitcoin.
Another way to say it is that there are two different types of people invested in bitcoin today..  One, those whose main motivation is the liberating tool, and the principles that inspired BTCs creation.  Two, those whose main motivation is making money.  You can only choose one master when the rubber hits the road.  I am very confident that Andreas would sacrifice his wealth if it meant a superior, or even continued, option for liberation.  Of course, we all hope he won't have to.  Also, I hope people can identify the master motivation behind everyone else involved in Bitcoin.  There's nothing wrong with making money, but the Dominion has access to all the money it can inflate &amp; steal, and it can be very profitable to betray the rest of humanity by joining them.

Despite its value in that way, why should people use it? When they consider their options, what about LTC should inspire them to use it, and maintain whatever exchange rate?
BTC is  and if the second BTC is pretty stable, and smaller, it makes some sense for micro transactions, as the fees would be less.  However, with all these other options coming out with their innovation, that aren't sticking to the CC 1.0 tech, it's only a matter of time before LTC offers less &amp; less to people who want to use a CC.  Even if BTC was  &amp; LTC could stay  the fact that there will be a  &amp; it's likely going to be more innovative (or at least the potential is there for it), even the lesser fees to micro transaction angle isn't a very big incentive.
If LTC started pushing some envelope, not only would it continue to benefit BTC, but if they could implement some characteristic that BTC isn't able to, and it proved to be fantastically valuable, they could just switch roles..  LTC could be the top coin, and BTC could be the supportive, lighter, CC that could experiment.
LTC serves a role, I just see that role being for BTC devs, and not for people who wish to use a CC.  However, I don't see why they can't try to be both.

I don't understand why people involved with Litecoin aren't aggressively pursuing things like anonymity, or any other new innovation.  How they could replicate BTC, albeit with a few adjustments, and think they'd weather all the new innovation..  There's only room for one old, antiquated, CC tech, and that's because BTC is essentially the reserve currency @   When you compare LTC to NXT, Counterparty, Zerocoin, Maidsafe, Ethereum, Darkcoin, Blackcoin, Namecoin, etc..  Even LTBcoin.  There's no reason why LTC should stay valuable unless they adapt &amp; evolve.
The good news for LTC is they have a huge head start over other coins.  If they can make changes BTC is supposedly too big to, perhaps they could give people a reason to continue to use it.

Do you think one of the wealthiest men on Earth likely is, or isn't, pro-establishment?  He's lied before.  He's very influential.  I assume it's not that he's incapable of understanding, but that he's using his influence strategically.  His target audience aren't those that know better, but the people who still believe that he's worth listening to.  Much like the media that reports it.
These guys who are donating all of their money, when they're part of a system that controls money, isn't quite as generous as you might imagine.  It's like the ocean donating water.  If he wants to share wealth, and not just money, he could free up the controls of money.  The next time one of these billionaires wants to donate money, I'd much prefer they use it to buy as much IP as they can with it, and free that for humanity.  They do shit like donate to renewable energy, yet stifle things like the battery technology in EV1.  Any day now they'll be able to match the capabilities of an electric car made in 1990s.  Buy the compressed air engines from Tata Motors, and open source that.  Actually produce products that are designed to be high quality, and last, rather than using planned obsolescence.  There are many examples, but none of this has much to do with the fact that Warren Buffet is obviously capable of knowing better, but somehow has managed to continually claim the establishment way is the right way.

I'm sorry.. I failed to mention the "for Bitcoin" part.. or "Poker Chips", or any CC.  If you can do this easily, all I can tell you is if I had the ability, I'd have done it a few years ago.  If you know how poker players take care of dealers who deal for them on one occasion, you can imagine the type of tips you'd get for freeing them with this type of decentralized app.  If they just gave you a tiny percentage of the rake they'd get to keep between them from then on, I think it would be well worth any programmers time.  You're basically giving them back both the rake that these poker sites are sustained on, and control over their ability to play, and their funds.
I can't imagine this is simple.  If it sounds that way, I'm probably not describing it well.  I assume it is possible, though.  It's worth A LOT of money.

How do you go from there to here;


I've just started to read about all of this, and so I'm not very familiar...  but I have no idea where you're coming from here.  The event is only important if it's good, and if it's BS, then "destroying" it is the perfect response.


Why is it going to far?  This conference only barely matters to the industry, and it matters less, or more but in a negative way, if they endorse frauds with exposure.
It seems like the perfect solution is to not attend organizations that will hurt the industry, and instead attend those with good business practices that will be good for the industry.
I don't know about this Garza character.  If he's a fraud, he can't be ostracized soon enough.  If he's not, hopefully he can prove it.  If anyone is assisting him in his fraud, they too should be ostracized.  I can understand being wrapped up in this convention and feeling it's more important than it is, but understand that you're gambling on this guy I've not read a single positive comment about, and there doesn't seem to be much uncertainty.  If you want this convention to be important, you've got a responsibility to make it important.  You can't take back your endorsement of this guy if he's proven to be a crook.

People throw the term "FUD" around as though it's illegitimate.  Like "conspiracy theory".
Everyone in r/bitcoin without any fear, uncertainty, or doubt, respond here so we can know who all the foolish, &amp;/or liars, are.
Bitcoin represents a new hope for liberty.  We've had it for less than a decade.  Some people claim x, y, z, as to why we should alter it, and yet I use it frequently with no problem.
You're damn right that's concerning.  I have my doubts as to the agenda behind this notion.  I can understand a blind effort for financial gain.  That's nothing new.  Sadly, I've seen plenty who don't understand, or give a shit, about freedom, too.
Fear, uncertainty, and doubt, under the circumstances, seems completely rational.  So is hope, if we don't fuck this up.  By "this", I mean what we have already.
Someone on here mentioned that ideally we'd not risk the  crypto, but try to surpass it.  Make aggressive changes to improve, &amp; overtake the  but once there, preserve it at all costs.  This isn't about market share protection.  It's about a tool that's too precious, and with too many enemies, to risk haphazardly.
Maybe that's a good idea, and maybe it's not, but it seems to me that there are some real well founded concerns there.  Dismissing them isn't convincing, at least not to me, and probably not to those who remember what it's like to have no bitcoin, and no hope of having bitcoin.
If you technical geniuses want to convince those of us who just aren't as enlightened, I'd recommend addressing peoples' "FUD" rather than dismissing it as a manipulation tactic (dismissing it as FUD is the same tactic you accuse it of being).  I try not to dismiss FUD that I don't see eye to eye with, but I have an imperative about preserving cryptocurrency..  Reasoning like "it might set us back years", or "it can't handle cups of coffee", is laughable compared to the urgency of maintaining crypto.
Make changes, and be aggressive, with any other CC.  Bitcoin is the keystone at the moment.  Risking it right now is so completely foolish that it's hard to imagine it not being purposeful subversion..  but make your case, and I'll hear you out.

I want to remind everyone to encourage people to look to spend Bitcoins on what they can (if anything) first, before looking to exchange into their local fiat.

It's all relative.  It's relatively less difficult today than it was 5 years ago, and if everyone tries to find a few people they can exchange into/out of bitcoin with, it will become easier &amp; easier.  Splitting 10% can definitely be motivating.
I challenge everyone to find at least 1 person they can exchange into/out of bitcoins with.  Once they do, I challenge them to find 2 more.  I've only had two people tell me that they've found 3, and I told them to find 2 more.
In theory no one needs 5 people to exchange with, but they're spreading the word, and making bitcoin more valuable, and private, in doing so.

I would encourage a different perspective.  I've never thought of it as a "rabbit hole".  I ask people if they take bitcoins all the time.

I suppose if you know you're dealing with someone who is that fragile, it wouldn't be worth it to suggest it to them.  I've never had anyone come back &amp; tell me they're burned out of asking, though, so it seems to be an unrealistic concern to me.

One thing I disagreed with is the notion that any CC is "their" golden goose.  Fiat currency, specifically the world reserve currency, is their golden goose.  I suspect the enemies of Bitcoin hold at least half the total market cap, and are positioning controlcoins as the next alternatives.  Apparently they have, or influence, at least +/-45% hash power too.
Destroying BTC means either, the elimination of CC if we're lucky, &amp; their preserved inflating theft structure...  or the elimination of CCs as an option for freedom, but they persistance as a tyrannical tool to entrap &amp; enslave humanity.
At one point I believed that Bitcoin must persist until we have a 2nd hope for humanity, and it being cooped meant it being weaponized, and the loss of CC as liberating technology.  Understand that if this were to happen, we'd literally be back BBTC praying for a miracle we can't imagine yet.
Now I'm not sure if that is the case or not.  Maybe Bitcoin has already served its purpose, and protected us as we left the crypto nest, and even if it were weaponized against other CCs, we'd still have some sort of cryptoanarchy solution.  I don't know enough to know.  I just continue to hope that Bitcoin remains  and that we have never ending conflict, and FUD, because when that stops, I'll assume the canary is dead, and we're out of time.  Sink or swim without Bitcoin.
This is why I've encouraged never risking bitcoin.  We've been at DEFCON 2 since they stopped convincing people to laugh at it.  One day, hard to imagine not far far in the future, we'll be at DEFCON 5, and all kinds of nice, sweet, hypothetical, experiments will be free to work.
I assume we'll have to see a fundamental change in human enslavement practices before we begin to get out of the woods.  If we need to rely on Bitcoin the whole time, we'll have to be eternally vigilant.  I'd like to think there are other innovations I don't know about right now that we can rely on...  but I hope we don't hear about them until they're ready.
TL/DR  The Dominion will commit every crime, destroy everything, and kill everyone, to stay on top of a sinking ship.  Their attack on free speech is one of their latest tactics, and it won't stop there.  Don't for a minute think that Bitcoin could be vulnerable and persist.  Not until they've given up, and that won't be anytime soon!  Do not take the internet, or bitcoin, for granted.

I tried to exchange a vehicle for Bitcoins for the longest time.  People kept calling ignoring that I specifically listed it for trade, and asking how many FRNs I wanted.  After having the discussion 20 times, I finally put a very high FRN asking price, but said I'd exchange for half that in Bitcoin.
Lot of calls.  No takers.  Finally exchanged it for a new roof.
This would get better over time if people perpetually look to exchange from BTC to what they want directly, rather than to needlessly, and to their own detriment, exchange into local fiat first.  Using fiat when it's not necessary is a lazy, inefficient, way out.

Right.  The problem being that miners are filling blocks pretending there is a block size issue, when in fact it's a miners filling blocks in a way they weren't intended issue.  So the problem isn't with the block size, which would be able to be filled at any size, but with the motivation of the miners, which are filling any sized blocks with something other than transactions that allow the network to function as intended.
Bitcoin needs to address that motivation, lest the blocks be filled at any size needlessly.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:04:57
I'm not sure what you mean.  I'm questioning if there is a problem.  Bitcoin is the most valuable CC, and climbing.  There is definitely a market demand for it as is.  People seem perpetually willing to change it, and evolving bitcoin is a good thing...  but if hypothetically it eventually were to be as efficient, or as valuable, as possible, changing it wouldn't be the way we want to go.
Again, that is hypothetical.  However, the demand for what Bitcoin is isn't a hypothetical point.

Those who understand and appreciate freedom understand that that's where Bitcoin derives its value &amp; purpose.  Those who don't, or the "everyone else", have no idea why Bitcoin is valuable, necessary, or that it has anything to with freedom in the first place.  They want to know how they can exchange in X, and exchange out &gt;X.
There's nothing wrong with profit, but there's shortsighted, short term profit, and then there's big picture, long term profit.  Without understanding, they have no idea about the big picture.
If our owners want to steal from us through inflation, and use that stolen wealth to subsidize an attack on BTC, those who don't understand will assist them, and take their pathetic short term profit now until CCs have been corrupted and used to intensify the tyranny.
Those who say you can't allow politics to enter into your decisions for investment either don't understand politics, or don't understand long term vs short term investments....  or are the shill house slaves trying to sabotage humanity.

And yet ETH is worth less than half of BTC.  ETH is a currency, but it's not really a CC.  It's more of an attack on CCs.  Assuming it is an actually CC, if ETH had to stand on its own on the front lines, I doubt it would look as good.  If I'm wrong, it will surpass BTC soon.
It just may be that Bitcoin right now is the best we have...  what strategy is best moving forward is another discussion.  There is definitely a market demand for a CC with BTC's attributes, as the climbing value indicates.

I don't think it can be taken that way.  We just so quickly went 10X that it's almost seen as a goal met.  A celebratory lap around the Bitcoin arena.  Anyone trying to say "I'm out because these guys who can pay off all their bills and buy Teslas marks a downturn to shit" would be completely disregarded in the way you're describing.  Pretending Bitcoin is a bad investment/currency at this particular point would be absurd.
Anyone who made a million, or hit whatever goal, who wants to exchange out of Bitcoin into financial security..  We are celebrating them.  The same reasons for them getting in when they did will keep them in, and exchanging for more, going forward.

That's the beauty of bitcoin.  It doesn't matter if it's a democratic government or not.  Bitcoin eliminates the potential for that type of regulation.
The point of limiting money to gold &amp; silver coin was to do this very thing.  They can demand whatever fiat legal tender they want going forward, but people will always have bitcoin.

You're projecting, and at least in my case, wrong.  It had nothing to do with profiting, which I explained over, and over, again.  It had to do with contributing to the network.
I know it's not easy, but try to think outside of the current bitcoin paradigm..  What I'm saying is, given that bitcoin is supposed to be a distributed network, there should have been an emphasis *by that community* on every single user being a node/miner.  Not for profit. This has nothing to do with profit.  Not to compete with huge companies, or governments, which isn't possible on the individual level...  but because for the concept of bitcoin to work, we all have to contribute enough so that no other single entity can own the network, and thereby destroy it.
So when I say that every single user should be encouraged to be a node/miner, I'm not suggesting that they each have a lot of money tied up in specific mining/node hardware..  I'm suggesting that, by default, the client should have not been decoupled from the mining/node, and when it eventually was, it should have been replaced with some sort of SETI screen saver type thing.  In other words, every user should, through using Bitcoin, be contributing.  It doesn't matter how insignificant that hash power is..  it has to do with having a distributed network.
Those of us who wish to spend more on bandwidth, or processing power, could do so.  Those who wanted to mine professionally could.
The bottom line is, if people gave a shit about bitcoin, and not about the profit they coveted, they would encourage EVERYONE to contribute in whatever way they were willing to, rather than the opposite.
@_date: 2015-04-17 17:27:32
    It doesn't matter how insignificant that hash power is


That's out of context.  It doesn't matter how insignificant every user using the bitcoin network contribution is if every user, by default, is contributing something, *if bitcoin is to work*.  It won't change that some people will contribute more for whatever their reasons.  This isn't instead of professional mining, but as well as.
Either distributed contributions can fend off a single attacker, or they can't, and it's back to the drawing board.  If what you're saying is that 95%+/- of the users can't provide some significant structural integrity to the network, then this is a failed experiment.  We're all just waiting for the final big players to cooperate, and it's all over.  Better we either all in, and trying, or all out, and not pretending that we're doing anything but supporting a network that inevitably will be owned, and manipulated by some conglomerate.


I don't.  Face the music.  Either this is a fight we can fight, or it's not.  If you've already surrendered the ground, and are just trying to make some bitcoin while it's still perceived valuable, so be it.  However, the majority of people involved are involved because they thought there was something to this decentralized ability thing.


All the centralization techniques will only result in the inevitable, which is those with the most resources taking control.  If I can subsidize a mining pool, someone with more resources can do the same in a zero sum game.
The network will be bigger tomorrow than it is today.  That will be true every day (for the most part) until the day when we realize the biggest fish have the network.  Then it's over.  If you believe in BTC, and want it to continue to be successful, you should encourage every benign addition to the network possible.

All I'll say is, it's one thing to give unsolicited warning/advice... say, the first half dozen times some explains they don't care about ROI, or how much better not mining would be..  If someone says "Thanks for the advice.  Noted.  I just want to learn the most efficient way to mine.", there's gotta be a point where everyone says "Ok.  We had to warn you, but since you insist, here's the latest strategies, etc.".
r/bitcoinmining is absolutely the last place to go if you're looking for guidance mining.  That's completely crazy.  There should be two sidebar items.  One that says "Warning: Mining is the worst thing you could ever do, and here's why..", and another one that says "They've been warned.

I have been thinking that the top CC shouldn't be risked, as the hopes for humanity rest with it.  I thought it should be accepted culturally, that whatever CC is on top basically stays in stasis until it's surpassed.  It's starting to look like this will happen due to gridlock in a fight to coopt the top CC, and so maybe I don't have much to worry about.
Having said that, people should stop looking for consensus, but take their best step forward.  Some will agree, and some won't.  Compromising, half steps does no one any good, but only assures that no one's best ideas are implemented.
You can't take it all, which the thousand or so CCs should be evidence of.  Put your best foot forward.  Not only is it in the best interest of humanity, but if many agree, you'll be very wealthy for it.

This reminds me of an analogy I once gave re: BTC, and other CCs to a friend who was a big Battlestar Galactica fan.  I said you know when Battlestar Galactica was humanity's only hope, leading them out of a dangerous system.  They fly ahead protecting the civilian ships, absorbing the barrage, and holding the Cylons at bay long enough for the civilians to jump to safety.  Well, BSG is BTC, and all the other CCs have to hope that BTC buys us the time to "jump" to safety from the dominion.  If BTC fails, all is lost.
This is why BTC doesn't need to be everything for everyone.  It needs to do one thing.  Offer a haven.  Which it does.  It should not be risked until we "jump", which may be after the last fiat has thrown in the towel.
Incidentally, the more advanced/networked Battlestars's complexity was used against them, and they were rendered useless.

I don't believe in authority.  I could easily say something like "Render unto X what is X's", and all that would mean is that what is X's is X's, and what isn't, X has no right to.

Bitcoin must become a completely anonymous CC, or it's a place holder for one that will.  I know everyone wants to pretend this isn't the case, and bitcoin is king, but bitcoin is bitcoin because it of what allows.  If it doesn't, it's just more shit that doesn't work for us that will be replaced.

Edit:  That was lazy of me.  The things you mentioned are partly why, but only because the technology can't withstand that adoption while maintaining, or providing, privacy.  The greater the adoption, &amp; exchange rate, before bitcoin is securely a liberating force, the less likely it will be to be one in the future.
There is a reason Satoshi made bitcoin the way s/he did.  It was a convincing enough attempt that those who valued the same principles were drawn to it.  When people started generating wealth from it, the ratio of those who valued the principles which made bitcoin, to people who didn't care, or worse, who opposed the principles, began shifting tremendously in a direction away from privacy &amp; freedom, and toward control.
If it is as I fear, Bitcoin is very convenient, especially for the dominion, so it's still valuable.  However, if bitcoin no longer represents the original hope, but the exact opposite of it, it will be replaced by another currency that does provide it.

Would it be possible to make an altcoin that also rewarded bitcoin nodes somehow?  I don't remember much about it, but I know Dash has a unique (or at least different than bitcoin) model.
I've wondered if it wouldn't make sense to have several tiers of related CCs, which could encourage support for more diversity, and allow for growth, experimentation, &amp; evolution.  This could possibly ease the need for BTC to be the lone solution for microtransactions, coffee purchases, remittances, savings, etc..

Whether or not they've created it, I assume the US government's perspective on bitcoin is probably the enemy of my enemy is my friend.  Or, bitcoin hurts the world reserve currency much less than it hurts everyone else.  Most people use Bitcoins as a mechanism for payment, or moving into federal reserve notes.
If they didn't create it, I wouldn't be surprised if they find it sufficient controlling all the points of centralization, &amp; potentially the hardware, which is plenty more than necessary to control it.  Even if they wanted to eliminate it, it might be most beneficial to wait until it's hit the ideal point where it's hurt Russia, China, etc., the most, but still being tolerable to the dollar.

I suspect that Bitcoin was either created to undermine non-reserve currencies, or is tolerated because it does.  Bitcoin is a decentralized, faceless, economic nuke, to the non-reserve currencies of the world.  It hurts the reserve currency less than it hurts others, and allows the globe to jump ship &amp; move to whatever they have the most faith in (which, for now, is the reserve currency).
I hope that the bottom 190 nations who don't really have any reserve currency aspirations of their own all decide to invest in Bitcoin.

The centralized points of coloring/corruption are not only problematic for privacy, but for the value of bitcoin itself.

I have this sinking feeling that the "Fedcoin" will be Bitcoin.  Whether because people are naive statists who foolishly comply, or the heads of mining pools are corrupted, or all the tech the network is run on is corrupted, etc..
It would be brilliant, as it would probably still be considered a free market currency, and serve as a failing example of what happens without central control..  or other nations may hop on board under the misconception that it's an incorruptible.  All in time to replace the failing dollar.
I hope my fears are unfounded.  I've grown more &amp; more concerned recently, and I find myself hoping that there are no more changes made to BTC.  Offer a replacement, if there's a supposed need, but don't change it.
It's scary as BTC will be an incredible liberation tool, or a truly horrible enslavement nightmare.  Potentially the worst, "None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.", kind.

Unfortunately not.  These exchanges exist at the behest of the state, and are central points of corruption.  Anything that can be corrupted will be.

It seems like they have to choose the high, very long, road back to legitimacy, or demonstrate the lack of decentralization, and level of control over the currency, they're currently discussing.. and sell themselves to establishment players.  Principled investors are already the minority in the CC world as it is.  Ethereum could start a ridiculous nosedive, but if big players liked that it was a wolf in CC's clothing, they might throw even more money at it, and drive it up.  Since the majority of people around here are predominately motivated by profit, I imagine plenty would get back on that ride.

Glad to see this discussion in NH.  I enjoyed the laugh at "faith in US gov.", and the sympathy out of the rep.
I'd encourage them to try to keep the discussion away from the technicality of BTC, for the same reason why they don't need to understand how the internet, and its multitude of components, credit card networks, bank transactions, telephone service, etc., work in order to use any of them to take payment.
The comparison to be made here when they mention holding cash is to a bank wire, which isn't cash.  A CC payment, which isn't cash.  A check, which isn't cash.  This is in regards to BTC the currency.  I assume the vast majority of the state's transactions are without cash.
...and comparing the BTC network to the telephone, or their internet service, or POS processor, etc..  It doesn't really matter how they work.  They either do work, and the state acknowledges payment, or they don't, and the demand is outstanding.
In all cases, I assume that the state only considers a debt paid when funds have been delivered to them.  I don't see this being any different.
Everything that people use as a medium of exchange, whether FRNs, gold, a cow, oil, ammo,  foreign currency, etc., is based on perception of value.  Saying that a five FRN bill is always worth a 5 FRN bill is akin to saying that 5 BTCs is always going to = 5 BTCs.  5 FRNs won't always be worth the same amount of BTCs, and 5 BTCs won't always be worth the same amount of FRNs.  As the final speaker mentioned, the graph of the crash &amp; burn of the FRNs reflects the change in the value...  but that's all pretty irrelevant given the matter at hands.  However, it was awesome seeing the rep bow his head in acknowledgment of the dwindling FRNs.

You're describing thieves who happen to be rich. The powerful get more powerful, because they're the most powerful around to take it.
There is nothing wrong with rich people getting richer as long as they're not paying some parasite to steal &amp; murder for them to do it.  Rich people being rich, and poor people being poor, is not an accident.  If someone is a fool with money, or brilliant with it &amp; without money, neither lasts very long.
This is why I think a lot of this donating of cash that gets so much coverage is a little ridiculous. Certainly it is charity, and it should be appreciated, but when you own the system of money, and you give away all the cash knowing it's all coming back to you, it seems like it is at least partially a publicity stunt. I'd much prefer to see someone in the position to donate large sums of cash free up some IP, or any other capital that results in the cash coming back. It's like the ocean donating some water. Imagine how it would effect humanity if Bill &amp; Melinda spent their fortune freeing all the IP they could get their hands on.
It will be a great thing if a cryptocurrency can help eliminate the inflation theft, and forced redistribution of wealth. It will have no effect on those who use it wisely, and invest in capital, having the most of it... and there is nothing wrong with that at all.  Wealthy people who don't violate the rights of others in achieving it should be wealthy, and be proud of it.
Capitalism is a good thing.  "Corporatism", "Cronyism", "Fascism", forced redistribution of wealth, etc., isn't.

Anarchists oppose rulers, or individuals who are subject to some "authority" other than their own. These individuals are free to invest in capital, or contract with each other.. &amp; they're also free to practice socialism with any willing. Absent of coercion, commerce only happens because both parties get something of greater value than that which they give up, or they wouldn't do it. There is no force or aggression involved in capitalism.
Not only are they not antithetical, anarchism, and capitalism, will always go hand in hand. Likewise, where there isn't freedom, there really isn't capitalism.
Being anti-illegitimate authority (which is any supposed authority other than an individual over themself) makes you both anti-state, and an anarchist.
If someone claims to be an anarchist, but against a free market, they could only oppose the free market through persuasion, and not force, otherwise they're not anarchists.

That's not authority. You've got two parties engaging in business because they're getting more than they're giving up. A mutually beneficial arrangement they both willingly enter, and may leave.

The governments of the world fund more terrorism than any civilian entity ever could, and they do it with their legal tender.

If you loan someone anything, document it well, and establish collateral acceptable to the lender, not only are you well protected in either case, but you are better off with BTC, as they won't be inflated endless (and all the rest of the drawbacks to FRNs). The only advantage to FRNs right now is that it's legal tender in the US, or backed by force. People in the US are forced to accept them as payment of debt.
I would loan BTCs in a second to anyone with acceptable collateral, and a short enough term. Doesn't even need to be a short term if I stipulate that I can cal it whenever I want. I'd be glad to get the extra BTC revenue, or the collateral.

Changing to a sound currency that can't be stolen from you would only secure your wealth, which is a very, very, very, good thing, and the whole point of BTC. Security of property with the rightful owner, where it belongs.

I advocate decentralization in all matters, and the only bits of technology I consider more vital to humanity than Bitcoin is [Freedombox]( and the energy source needed to use it.
Government is the disease posing as the cure.  Statists encourage dependence. They're not just going to happen to resist change that will result in less power for them. It's the purpose of the state to preserve, and increase power, and utilize its human capital to that end.
The statist faith is the most ubiquitous, and destructive, religion the world has ever known. Convincing the faithful that government is not only an unnecessary evil, but that it results in the opposite of what they intend from it, is a difficult proposition.

What could Square do to bring BTC to people that isn't already there?

Their positions aren't identical, and they involve different obligations, but they're both free, sovereign, individuals who don't have to do anything they don't wish to.


Which was stipulated and agreed upon, or the boss is outside the bounds of the agreement.  The "worker" is free to remind the boss of the terms of their agreement, or go cease doing business.  If there is a contract between the two, the "worker" has the right to have the other party meet the agreed upon obligations.


In many cases certainly. The "worker" job is different from the worker whose job it is to be boss. Regardless, everyone knows their role &amp; accepts them willing in exchange for whatever they agree on, or they don't and they don't do business.


Not at all.  They're equal individuals with the same rights. There is no authority, as it's just terms of the agreement. If we're neighbors &amp; you welcome me into your home, and tell me not to do X (let's say smoke cigarettes), you're not my authority. You're your own authority, as am I. It's your property, as I am my own property. I can agree to those terms, or walk. If I invite you into my home, you can tell me not to smoke, but you've got not standing, and I'll probably laugh it off. You can try to persuade me, or you can leave.
The difference between government/force is that there is no agreement.  If there was, that wouldn't be government, it would just be an agreement among a bunch of individuals.
