Read and watch Andreas Antonopoulos. He is a fantastic speaker, he has tremendous knowledge and the best is that he presents the most complicate things in such a simple way. And it's free.

I have Gemini and my options to fund is through credit card and bank account. Coinbase is gdax in a way so yes coinbase accepts credit cards. You have to register through coinbase to use gdax anyway. I used to have bitfinex account 1 year ago and was accepting credit cards. I don't know now if that changed, as a US citizen I couldn't use it anymore.

There isn't anonymously trade through exchanges. You have to transfer money, to the exchange, and that means you have to connect a bank account or a credit card, and that is not anonymously in any way. The only way to be anonymously is to have already a wallet with bitcoin, because someone transfered this/these btc to your wallet. Then as I know you can register to binance "almost" anonymously, transfer your btc there and trade. I say almost because I don't remember exactly the steps for registration for the 1st level in binance, but I think it's just your email. After that if you want more advanced options and go to 2nd level it stops being anonymously.

Well I am not familiar with every exchange, but with gdax, gemini, bitfinex the only options they give you to fund your account is bank account or credit card.

You are right about Gemini, just logged in and checked. And you may probably be right about Bitfinex too, I don't know why I was so sure that they accept credit cards. Thanks for correcting that. You don't have to be ironic though.

I agree with you "ethareum" is sc4m. Now, make everybody a favor and return to your hole. The scam is you and your retarded spelling and opinion.
