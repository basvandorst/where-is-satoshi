Bitcoin will be the next Apple stock that your parents missed out on but now you have a chance to gain. 2020 1-BTC=$10,000 USD+ with most major company's accepting it as a form of currency. (My thought)
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:30:53
that's deep
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:44:26
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:13:39
Interesting, thanks for the input.
@_date: 2017-05-06 04:56:52
I wouldn't say I'm praising but saying that by the way Coinbase has not responded in over 2 months it leaves me no room but to say anyone else it better than them.
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:52:02
Good to hear you are getting the most out of crypto atm..  Your response seemed to be what I read most on here when people would post "What site do you use to buy Bitcoin?". 
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:45:30
I am looking at everything I can to read up on how much this could bone this great currency.
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:47:07
If you bought when it got below 1700 you did it right.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:34:30
Will BTC outway the USD in terms of use, (most shops, markets etc allow BTC payments, houses, car payments etc). Will BIP 148 deep anal Bitcoins true potential 
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:42:45
It will recover maybe not as fast maybe it will, all I know is that after siting back and watching the market for years, it's as strong as ever.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:31:34
Honestly do whatever you feel comfortable doing, if you are going to withdrawal in BTC I recommend using Blockchain wallet to deposit/withdrawal from gambling sites because they don't care as when coin base finds out they freeze your account. 
Step 1. Set up Coinbase Account then purchase how much you want.
Step 2. Create Blockchain Wallet and transfer your funds from Coinbase to your Blockchain Wallet Address.
Step 3. Send Gambling website the amount you want from your Blockchain Wallet to their Wallet address.
Step 4. If it is not a scam then withdrawal your balance to coins and have them send it to your Blockchain Wallet Address.
Step 5: Transfer those coins you now own into your Trezor for Cold Storage and forget you own them.
This is the answer you are looking for... If not do not give into this scam.

End of September**
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:41:33
Sounds good bro, just saying good idea to buy while BTC is at it's low before it rises back up.
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:56:15
Really last I checked they are offering LTC as well as of a few days ago..
@_date: 2017-05-06 04:58:42
I need to look into GDAX as well.
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:49:08
Let's hope
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:11:12
I'm referring to the "Cloudbleed" incident.
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:34:23
Did it take 30 days to increase your limit?
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:53:25
Have not read much about Kraken. Yeah verification time is what I believe is keeping some of the consumers away.
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:07:12
I agree they're Pros/cons to using all exchanges and that's kinda of what I am trying to point out in this thread. Customers looking to by BTC/ETH/LTC.. do not have really any options either (Buy at inflated unreal prices at ATM's, give your entire identity to a company, or buy is small amounts over long periods of time effectively costing you potential growth daily.... Backs against the wall.
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:02:05
Yeah, also gonna look into GDAX any other exchanges you personally use/trust?
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:53:30
My friend Mr.fork
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:13:03
That is one of several issues with consumers going through exchanges but have no other option if they don't want to pay $200+ markup on ATM's exchange.
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:39:56
Always 
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:38:20
This means buy

Still trying to reach out to Coinbase, but I'm just opening my exchange options overall. Gonna look into GDAX as well.
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:52:06
Possible China is China
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:52:30
Whatever you feelsz
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:45:42
What other exchanges are trust worthy/ good rates?
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:33:54
We are strictly talking about how one of these two decisions will impact the value of 1 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:24:36
they want your money and to give you zero.  Edit** "When it's to good to be true it's usually not"
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:08:42
I think he is
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:53:14
What are good fee's for ATM's (best I could find uncharged $80) on current price (USD: buy at 1693.21 (7.5%), sell at 1540.77 (2%)
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:43:29
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:47:30
Extra deep
@_date: 2017-05-16 00:15:12
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:09:02
True, but in one way or another these exchanges are bending us over in the end.
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:48:02
I did, most are inflating total price by $160 or more. Wish I lived in NY lots of ATM's with not the worst fees. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:04:16
Could very well happen but I'm just pointing out that I solely looked as Coinbase for all my exchanges when in reality I should have looked at Gemini/GDAX.
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:09:33
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:42:09
Thanks for your opinion
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:58:43
rations are low
@_date: 2017-05-10 23:55:37
I agree Coinbase is nice, but the limits are low unless you have gone through the 30+ day verification process.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:01:09
@_date: 2017-05-06 00:42:10
Any exchange will let you buy any amount
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:23:44
After all decisions are final you think so?
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:17:12
so guarantee fork
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:42:15
Cheese dip
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:30:03
Gemini is good 
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:23:23
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:26:48
Fixed 
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:35:45
Are we thinking below 1300?
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:21:15
Interesting, let us know what happens.
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:41:39
My ears are stuffed 
@_date: 2017-05-15 20:34:37
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:36:49
Its current value bubble  1 BTC=2,000 USD
Sorry for not clearing that up
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:34:19
You think crash and burn?
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:41:21
The oooollll Reacharound
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:00:11
Yeah you get bent over by either company when it comes down to want to do anything regarding Crypto. It's really sad because there potential is here but certain roadblocks still/might always persist.
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:17:30
Might drop below $1700 soon
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:38:10
Same, buy up all the quick selling coins! Watch the price climb back up and surpass $2k 
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:01:20
I'm more or less referring to the "Cloudbleed" incident.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:39:46
I love you
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:47:47
Coinbase is having diarrhea when it comes to anything lately. They didn't expect this much of a influx in users I bet.
@_date: 2017-05-15 03:10:48
Fortunejack.com 
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:43:45
Good point I understand it is money/currency but also is treated like a stock because of its volatility.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:57:37
Rations were scarce
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:12:35
This sounds like a scam.. But Coinbase is an exchange buy/sell from and your Cold storage or wallet is your Trezor. You buy coins from Coinbase and for your circumstance you need to transfer those coins to a Blockchain wallet or your Trezor(more hassle, unless you are cold storage) then deposit however many much you want into your "gambling site" to be able to "withdrawal" your winnings or owed money.
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:20:18
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:27:12
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:10:17
They will at some point just wait.
@_date: 2017-05-06 04:57:45
Good to know. Do you use Coinbase strictly as your exchange?
@_date: 2017-05-16 00:44:19
Next to the Mothership
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:21:02
Terms of price..
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:35:57
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:29:01
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:20:25
So then what exactly happens to my coins today essentially  
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:25:18
agreed trezor is good
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:15:28
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:18:27
Love you, great name
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:49:45
No. I just don't understand why one company has not taken that extra step to allow customers the opportunity to buy BTC/ETH/LTC without giving your life away (in terms of identity). The verification process on both sites are bad however you look at it, on top of not being able to buy in at when you have the available funds/at the correct market price.
