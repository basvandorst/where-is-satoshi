noone thinks bits are difficult. uBTC is difficult.

I respect what you are doing; best of luck!

I agree, but at the same time, if the bitcoin system is so vulnerable that these early companies can literally destroy it, its not a good system to begin with.

even if he is absolutely wrong on this, that does not mean he is a clown shill by any means. I am sure we have all been very wrong about something, at some point or another.

i've never even heard of imgur pro before, but I'd buy it with bitcoin

great now its that much easier for anyone to subdue him and encourage a malicious attack...
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:28:57
you have told many souls already that you are potentially going to invest in bitcoins; locked doors won't help. Use different forms of security. BIP38 encryption is a good method.

that is scary

ghash IO won't have any effect on BTC dying, unless it was a flawed system to begin with. You just missed my point, I own many btc. We just can't rely on people playing nice to survive.
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:09:53
and coinjoin is implemented into bitcoin already right? And its easy to hard-fork to implement it? Coinjoin won't ever be a real thing. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 06:45:45
gg bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-07 23:32:03
Its not Ghash that is the problem, its any of the users who contribute to the hashrate. They are scumbags.

I was surprised to stumble upon btc as a payment option, made my choice to purchase much easier. Paid through the coinbase app and it was a great experience; one of my first payments with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 10:47:17
yeah but altcoins can legitimately threaten bitcoin by implementing features that bitcoin can't, darksend with darkcoin for example. Coinjoin won't be implemented because bitcoin won't hardfork for it. If anonymity is ever important, darkcoin will threaten bitcoin.

The super long addresses and the awkward need to copy/paste them or scan the QR code will eventually be replaced by more convenient methods. Who will figure it out first and be rich?
@_date: 2014-06-13 05:34:06
let it ride... if BTC dies because a pool has &gt;50% it is a bad system anyways. We can't rely on people being trustworthy/honest in any financial system.
@_date: 2014-05-31 22:11:24
no easy way unfortunately
@_date: 2014-06-05 12:57:07
I don't think its bad long term actually, it shows how powerful encryption can be in a way that people will not forget.

What have I been missing all my life...
@_date: 2014-06-05 13:01:26
yeah they aren't too bad, but they do have an "antiquated" feel to them. I have been unable to scan a few perfectly good QR codes with my phone and had to type in a long string of btc address and check it multiple times while trying to show how easy it is to transfer BTC. Think I killed the persons interest permanently.
@_date: 2014-05-24 09:24:09
me too
@_date: 2014-06-06 21:34:04
good luck, hope the luck turns around! 
@_date: 2014-06-13 05:35:44
the bitcoin protocol, if that is an actual risk.
@_date: 2014-06-02 10:29:39
Much better software than windows desktop, launch programs efficiently instead of double clicking on pictures or searching through start menu. I appreciate the program, and was surprised to see it is now accepting BTC donations!

you know what that also means...

really cool story, a glimpse at the potential of bitcoin to connect people internationally.
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:04:13
as a person who makes various investment choices for a living based on limited information, I would say its a great bet in terms of the expected value per dollar risked. The utility of the $22k is low to you, so that means, in my mind, you are better off taking a higher risk, more profitable gamble with bitcoin. Buy a small amount of bitcoins before you do this, though, and learn to secure them, back them up in multiple locations, etc. Set and forget.

do you get to vote on whether to double spend or not?
