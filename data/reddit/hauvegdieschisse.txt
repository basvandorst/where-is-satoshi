Kerosene is cheaper than propane man. Also look into waste oil burners.

Fortunately, for someone with no bitcoin who has finally learned his fucking lesson, this means that I can invest.

I think it's brilliant. They're almost $700 a month and you're required to live in them your freshman and sophomore years. I think he's just getting his money's worth.

Sold at my break even. That's what I get for not fucking paying attention all day.

I sold my bitcoins on Saturday and have not gotten my funds yet. I'm somewhat concerned.

I don't know what any of this means.

I was thinking about this earlier today when I realized I bought another .3btc at $485 and I'm still in the black...

I have no experience or education on the subject but if you give me money I'm a really good bullshitter.

If a stockbroker posts an ad in the newspaper saying a certain stock will rise and he is right, people will notice, but won't do anything. 
If the same stockbroker next week posts a story about another stock going down and he is right, people will notice. They might follow his advice. 
If he's wrong, he will be ignored. 
But that doesn't matter, as half of his ads say it will rise and the other half say it will fall, regardless of the week, and the papers are randomly distributed. 
Someone down the line is getting all of the papers where he's right. 
The point is, improbable things happen all the time. You being right before has little impact on your ability to be right about upcoming events.

In the winter, he just opens a window and throws a fan in it. It's cold here an overwhelming majority of the time anyways. 
Plus, the university can't do anything. The dorm contract doesn't say anything about overuse of electricity.

Nah. I'll buy cheaper and HODL. It's that last .3 that got me. I bought .7 for 190 when it was at 260 and it was driving me fucking nuts that it wasn't round and even (looking back, this is a stupid fucking reason to do anything) and bought the remaining .3 at $485, when I should have instead sold.

My buddy lives in the dorms here and bought a mining rig because he's not paying for the electricity.

Yeah it's a bubble.
Fortunately, bubbles like this are a way for me to get a bit of extra cash and buy stupid crap every now and then.

I lived there for 2 years and I had to a couple times, mostly because I was using power tools in the dorms which they didn't like (Even though it wasn't at night and it was a LOUD dorm). It said nothing about that or power tools.
