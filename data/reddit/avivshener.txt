Hardfork is a maybe, no?
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:12:22
Thank you. Unfortunately I have a feeling it won't work from Israel :/
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:05:26
I did not.
Good for you for knowing everthing. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:48:38
I'm sure that people in the carriages industry spoke against automobiles at the first couple of years.

I can't wait for my Ledger nano S to arrive. My coins are on blockchain and I'm worried.
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:41:56
Good. That's good. Still need to wait and see.
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:49:03
I would like to see something like that in about 3 years. Right now we're in a middle of a crossroad, and that is a crappy ending for a movie :)
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:28:31
I read somewhere that if you have bitcoin you're not supposed to die. That was a relief.
But anyway, I think that it's like if you had a safe. You need to give someone close the code and the location, or else it will be useless. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 11:52:31
Wait. So in November there will be another split and a new coin will be "born"?
@_date: 2017-09-23 07:19:30
Interesting piece.
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:33:30
Double your coins?
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:59:53
How and where did you put an order?
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:29:39
About time. It felt like there was a wall at 3,999.
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:06:21
Than why not wait until you get the shit coin and then sell it for alt?
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:23:28
Cats videos on YouTube. Never fails.
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:07:41
Probably the logo.
For real, there are just too many coins out there right now, the market feels like a joke to me.
Let the main coins actually get overall market acceptance and then create new coins that will join the market. We're not there yet, but still new coins are coming out all the time. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:08:02
Take that back!
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:33:41
Good luck, man. 
If it will have a big dip, buy a little more and then you'll feel better. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:20:07
Why not from their website?
It takes time because so many people are ordering, but they also have a retail section where you can see other options to buy from. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:25:13
Something about a final date for Chinese exchange to operate, I think. Could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:00:00
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:41:46
This is great to hear. A major step towards mainstream. Hope there is truth in the story.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:47:35
Ledger nano s. Read about it.
@_date: 2017-09-23 07:21:55
In my opinion, the day that a company like Amazon will decide to accept Bitcoin will be a huge step forward for all cryptocoins. Nothing says mainstream like Amazon. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 07:12:22
It's seems as if we're get closer to 4,000 now, but I wonder what will happend on the 30.9. this date as been mentioned a couple of times lately.
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:07:08
Did you tell your children that their father put all their money in an exchange? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:52:49
I don't see why. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:09:51
I agree that there are way too many cryptocoins out there, like enough already.
Still, most people don't know or care. They know about Bitcoin and want to see what will happend with it. 
I believe that Bitcoin would have been stronger, value wish, if the money was going in for one coin and not 100, but I'm not sure that it would have been more mainstream because of it.
I would still have liked for the tsunami of new coins to have happened a few more years down the line, when both Bitcoin and Ethereum would have had a chance to make a bigger impact on the world economy.
Oh well. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:58:13
Newer, can hold more coins, more user friendly and cost less. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:29:48
Is this for real?
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:29:38
I think it's more of a question of do you need the money now? If not, than maybe let it do it's thing. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:56:00
I have the feeling that a year from now we will look back on this time and think, "we used to have auch a small amount of cryptocoins back then".
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:28:24
No. Of course not.
Just sell a kidney.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:48:33
It's great. Don't worry about it. There is no wrong decision here.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:43:46
I don't know what will happend, but I'm starting to think about switching most of what I have in bitcoin to ETH before and November fiasco. After I'll see the results I can switch back. 
Don't know. This all thing is annoying. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:03:22
I've ordered from French to Israel and that was the sum, so I'd be surprised if you will pay more.
Maybe try sending them a mail and ask. I also don't think they can charge you more than what you pay when you placed your order. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:08:34
They should just go and start their own coin, without connecting it to Bitcoin (happened everyday is seems).  All this splits make the all thing feels like childrens are calling the shots. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:10:47
Most people that are not Russian will have a problem with supporting a Russian currency. At least that's what I believe.
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:19:40
Is the use of the word "satoshi" an official thing? Or is it just a Reddit thing?
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:27:10
Yes. That he did.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:02:53
I would go with Ledger nano S.
Newer and I believe that it will be better in adding new coins in the future.
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:18:57
I know it sometimes easy to forget what China really is, but at the end of the day they are not a democracy, so nothing of their latest actions surprises me. Unfortunately.
