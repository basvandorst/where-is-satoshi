Yes. Let's not bury our heads on this one. 
  
This is a major issue. 
  
Remember, Nakamoto himself stated that the issue with the current monetary system is that it requires high levels of trust. Bitcoin is supposed to solve this issue but if an entity owns 51% and we all just shrug our shoulders and say "Well, we trust this pool!" or "We trust that the miners in the pool will jump ship if things go awry" then the technology has lost one of it's core benefits to humanity.

Please hear me out! I think you have a great skillset for making Bitcoin a revenue stream. You may even have some good ideas, but please keep in mind that even the best ideas, and best intentions can end up in disaster with poor execution. 
Stepping out of a secure job with no plan and a family to support is really, really risky. Instead of just jumping out with no plan I recommend you take the energy from hating your job and wanting more and start building a plan. Plot it out, get feedback from people you respect. Find out what resources you'll need and THEN make your decision to leave your job.

Wow. You're absolutely right. This was a publicly available contract that people entered into with the ability to have full knowledge of the complete mechanism.
  
Those that want to fork over this remind me of another familiar "I didn't know what I was signing!" ideology - student loan recipients. You signed on a line, you agreed to an interest rate, but fast forward 5-8 years and you're angry that you have to pay back what you borrowed - with the full contract in clear view?
  
The difference is that student loans are offered to young minds that have likely not engaged in financial contracts. The DAO *should* have garnered the attention of more savvy technical and financial types.
  
C'est la vie, Etherium.

Yes. He had a good point, "Perception drives value", but lets not lean out so far as to say that we perceive fantasy things as valuable, in the context of Bitcoin. The more people understand the "realness" of Bitcoin the better off the protocol, market, and community will be in the long term.
I usually press this point by informing people of the exchange rate. That's when eyebrows go up. That's how I convince people that Bitcoin is, in fact, NOT a fantasy.

Of course they care about miners. Miners are an integral part of the Bitcoin economy.
I'd never ask for an Algo or protocol change. That's ridiculous. I like Bitcoin because of the algorithm/protocol. It's excellent. It should not be altered to assist the mining community, in my opinion. (Barring any unseen and terminal errors found at a later date.)
All I'm saying is that if some pressure/incentive was given to AVG, ESET, AVAST - what have you, (all of whom are already in the business of nixing viruses/trojans) it would have a positive effect on Bitcoin. It was a very short, simple comment. No "simply retarded shit" here.

@_date: 2012-10-31 19:33:55
Of course you care. It's stealing at the base of it. Do you want to help malicious software fund itself? ZeroAccess is nasty. It isn't simply a miner bot. You wouldn't want it on your computer and you wouldn't want to fund the guys who made it if you did have it. 
Stealing people's electricity, even for mining BTC, is bad.

Your last comment is interesting, and with Coinbase being in beta I would be interested in hearing the results of taking your test a step further. 
After transferring .078 transfer .002 or .012 and check the outcome. I'd suspect that it isn't displaying anything past the hundredth, but the underlying value is still taken into account. 
If I am correct in assuming that the value is intact underneath the output then displaying the thousandths, ten-thousandth and so forth is pretty simple. 
@_date: 2012-10-13 18:32:27

I just cancelled my order. I can't have my money, that was supposed to be earning for me by October/November, tied up until mid-January. I'm not angry with Tom at all, it just seems like there are more hurdles to clear then any developer either knew about or wanted to admit... 
Then again, it could be a bit more devious than that. After all, the early you could announce your ship date the more pre-order money you had coming in, regardless of what you could truly do. 
I will give props to Avalon for giving out an honest ship date. I'm interested to see what actually happens in January.
@_date: 2012-10-31 13:31:22
The Bitcoin Foundation should put itself to good work and pressure the Antivirus powers that be to find a quick and reliable way to clean up ZeroAccess. If we nix this botnet then hashing power goes down, then difficulty goes down, and us miners can make some more BTC!

I agree with you, you can try to make anything try to sound absurd by reducing it to its smallest parts but it doesn't change the sum. This type of attempt reminds me of the court hearing scene in Blow:

@_date: 2016-07-02 15:17:23
You're confused about this conversation. We are discussing supply and demand, not Bitcoin specifically. Supply can go up for a number of reasons and not all are tied to the value of a given item as you're positing here. My point still stands, if Bitcoin encourages growth in the alternative energy markets it will be good for everyone by making alternative energy sources more affordable for the average person.
A couple pointers: 
  
Don't open your argument with an ad hominem attack. That's the absolute fastest way to lose credibility.
  
Make sure you understand the topic being discussed before interjecting. This is best done with simple questions before launching into your position.
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:33:56
That's not the fundamental law. He is talking about supply and demand. More demand can be met with more supply, thus not driving the price up - which is 's point and I think he's right. As alternative energy becomes cheaper, more people will want to get into it and more manufacturers will venture into the market.

I'd like to correct you on the Ukyo/Bitfunder line item.

I had this issue a week ago. I hopped into Coinbase's freenode and chatted with Julian L who, while being initially vague, ended up explaining the issue with their fraud prevention system.

Government/High Powered Individual acquisition of over 51% of the network - injecting a modified protocol.
All this high conspiracy talk is a bit too fantasy land for me. There will be no Government "War on Bitcoin" - barring people of using it and setting up concentration camps for those that do - if any party with enough interest and cash wants to erode the integrity of the network it need only buy its way into the protocol. 
It won't be cheap, and it won't be lucrative but it will serve to end Bitcoin.

Do you even know what AM share price was when he purchased these? It's quite possible he could've doubled his coins instead of purchasing these USB Eruptors. You also assume that the only benefit of AM shares is the dividends and not the increased value of the shares themselves as the company continues its growth. 
Check out a calculator for 3 gh/s. (Here's one: 
Average generation time for a block (solo): 353 days, 12 hours 
This is at current difficulty... (hint: It's going up!) What little he might make will continue to diminish to nothing as the network difficulty continues to erode the value of these miners at a rapid pace. That .4949 BTC a week is going to decrease every two weeks with the difficulty adjustment. If the difficulty jumps another ~20% in two weeks his new weekly income is .406 BTC an ~18% decrease. This will continue month after month as more and more ASICS hit the network. I may be off a bit, but not enough to really change the reality of this scenario.
Here are some difficulty projections:  
  
21,335,323 29-Jun-13    
32,002,994 29-Jul-13  
48,004,490 28-Aug-13  
72,006,735 27-Sep-13  
108,010,103 27-Oct-13  
Source:  (I think this guy is under-projecting a bit.)
Guess who doesn't have to worry about this? Those of us with stock in ASICMiner! AM keeps up with the network hashrate so we don't have to. We get nice weekly payouts and get to see stock values climb as His Friedness continues to grow out his mining farm and produce better hardware, and that's if my dividend payouts don't increase, which they probably will due to increased sales!
MORE FUN WITH NUMBERS! I've averaged a .25046 BTC weekly dividend payout since I invested in AM on 5-15-13. At current network difficulty increases (~20% each adjustment) I'll make more than this guy's ten USB Miners in 4 adjustments or 8 weeks:
USB Miner Weekly Profits with Projected Difficulty Adjustment of ~20%: 
.406  
.33292  
.27299  
.22385  
How does 1-3% weekly sound now? How about having stock in the company that is currently monopolizing the mining industry? 
That's right. MUCH Better.

Pretty exciting, actually. A major concern was the relationship between the two entities (AMC and VMC), so creating one company to invest in is a great step in the right direction. This also clears up some of the financial information that was previously spread across two companies. 
It appears that Ken is not only listening to his shareholders but is also efficient in executing his plans. Things are looking better. There will be lots of FUD and nay-saying until the first of the AM Fast-Hash Miner is added to the farm/sold, at which point we will see true market acceptance of the company and a share value explosion.
