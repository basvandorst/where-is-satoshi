If you needed to buy $1 million in bitcoin, but you knew you couldn't do it all at once and had to spread out your purchases over 5 days, would you really keep $1 million in a trading account online on MtGox.com that could be compromised?
No, you would wire the $1 million to MtGox directly. MtGox would then program Willy to buy you $1 million in bitcoin over several days. That way, your money is safe in MtGox's hands, you can't be hacked, and MtGox would take care of the trades for you. Also, you would likely negotiate and settle on some kind of flat fee that would be different from the standard per-trade trading fee.

American companies engage in exact same practices, but we do it in a way that is more identifiable to us. For example, in this specific situation an American company would send a formal letter from a law firm that details the exact grounds for nullifying the original contract, and specific terms for creating a new one. It would be much more "straight", as opposed to Chinese companies which would do things in a much more informal and roundabout way.

Actually, it IS quite a bit more ridiculous. 
Bitcoin was a technological achievement that was researched and developed specifically to tackle some of the most glaring problems of the financial world in a digital era. 
Dogecoin, on the other hand, is a clone based on a meme of a funny dog picture that encourages speaking in broken english.

Wow, I never thought of it this way. That actually makes total sense. If people are living their lives completely in bitcoin, then their wealth (real estate value, etc.) is then priced in bitcoin, not in dollars. That's amazing, thank you for posting.
