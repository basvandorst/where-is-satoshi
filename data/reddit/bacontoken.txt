I would make a kit with a raspberry pi, some sort of casing, and the required software and offer it to the Bitcoin community and the raspberry pi community. Ask the first wave of users to assemble it and test it themselves and provide a step by step DIY for doing so. Charge only for the cost of the components and shipping and ask for donations to continue development. Let the demand build before you enter production. Very cool idea, I'd build one.

Right, you could still offer assembled units and consulting for a premium, but since it's open source, you might as well offer a kit to get it into the hands of the community with little overhead on your part.

With Bitcoin, the definition of spam is subjective and distributed among participants of the system. Wallet services may define spam to better serve their users. Miners may define spam to maximize their profits. The key idea here is that there are no terms of service associated with the Bitcoin protocol.

This would be more useful at a federal level, but could serve as a model to follow if implemented at the state level. 
Define it in its different use cases and the implicated tax requirements:
1. Long term investment as a commodity (capital gains over 1 year)
2. Short term use equivalent to a foreign currency (no tax liabilities on short term gains when used as a currency)
3. As a nonfinancial ledger- leave the door open for other use cases (data storage, smart property, something we haven't thought of yet) and ensure that services operating on the blockchain won't incur tax liabilities for nonfinancial ledger entries.

Regulators need to focus on regulating specific uses of Bitcoin and stop trying to set regulations on an open protocol. AML laws for large amounts used as currency? Good. FTC guidelines and regulations for using the ledger as a way to publicly offer and distribute shares of a company? Awesome. Make the distinction between use cases very clear and then regulate each use case in a similar way to the old form of business, currency, and exchange. Protect users and promote multisig by making it inconvenient to take complete control of a user's Bitcoin via a single private key. Make clear exceptions for non-fiscal uses!

He's literally asking the community for advise and you are responding with heated accusations. It seems as though the echo chamber is in your head my friend.
