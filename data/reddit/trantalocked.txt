If that's really how you want to define censorship, then the debate is over. People/orgs/companies including PayPal have the moral RESPONSIBILITY to "censor" what they deem unfit. Just as a 7-11 clerk should "censor" a screaming homeless man in his 7-11. This is how culture works and should work. Society "censors" (by your definition), while government enforces the law while not forcing legal action on people for speech.
Non-government parties shouldn't just let each other say whatever the fuck they want without social consequences. PayPal used their moral imperative to not let someone who's a total lying scammer use their private platform.

So we'd actually be able to crash the meme market?
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:11:39
Someone correct me if I'm wrong but bar some insane amount of hype on TV news, demand won't save this crash and only more BTC going to holders will. So if that follows, as % of BTC being held goes up, BTC price goes up, right? So we just need to wait a while for holders to take over?

Is the consensus not to use coinmarketcap for price referencing? Fluctuations are more volatile on individual exchanges.

It's a 3.67% loss from 6048 in february to 5826 just recently in june on coinmarketcap. Things are still looking promising, I'm just not completely sold on a reversal yet.

I agree, joking about suicide shouldn't be socially allowed in any context other than between individuals in private, and even then it's questionable. It's just so common these days even I catch myself making jokes like that to myself and it isn't ok.

Is a % growth chart a legit way to prove that bitcoin is still bullish even now?
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:30:40
A lot is speculation but a large portion of buyers and hodlers also believe that bitcoin will one day be a legitimate and necessary part of the world economy, and a household name to boot. It might not be the daily use type crypto but something akin to gold for cryptocurrencies.

FUD = Fear, uncertainty and doubt. It's often articles about it being regulated or outlawed in countries around the world, with India being the recent subject. There was also the news about Facebook "BANNING BITCOIN...or rather cryptocurrency advertisements...and just for now until the scamcoin pyramid schemes stop being a thing...and btw crypto is fine we're just trying to grab peoples attention with headline FUD."
Let's not forget that Valve was accepting bitcoin on steam, which serves hundreds of millions of users, for a while but had to stop (for now) because the price was too volatile. That was their reason; not because bitcoin doesn't have a future, because Valve knows it has a future.

Title is not the most helpful because it adds to the stupid Bitcoin Core FUD implying that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Core have nothing to do with each other and that we're being lied to. 
I keep seeing people shout "BITCOIN IS BITCOIN!" here and on twitter. Do these assholes not realize how they're coming off when they say this? Just fucking say that Bitcoin Core is the software implementation of Bitcoin instead of only focusing your words telling people "Bitcoin Core **ISN'T WHAT YOU THINK IT IS! WATCH OUT!** Bitcoin=Bitcoin=Bitcoin=Bitcoin=Bitcoin=Bitcoin=Bitcoin=Bitcoin=Bitcoin=Bitcoin=Bitcoin=Bitcoin=Bitcoin=Bitcoin!"
*This isn't the same* as Bcash/Bitcoin Cash vs Bitcoin for fuck's sake.

I'm guessing 5K is the point at which it nose dives. Otherwise it should continue to be healthy and grow into the future.

The people who say Bitcoin is dying/is going to die either use reasons like other cryptos have better tech or point out the flaws like power usage and transaction verification time. What these people don't get is the masses will continue to use, support and invest in Bitcoin as long as it's apparently secure and useful (as a store of value and as a currency) and remains a positive household name. Just because Bitcoin has obvious flaws doesn't mean it's going to die. Once scarcity really comes into play after the final Bitcoin has been mined, and once we've seen significant market and infrastructure implementation, it'll take a disaster to keep Bitcoin's value from skyrocketing. It isn't going to be a fiat replacement, but something like in between gold and fiat. Bitcoin won because it was the first, it has the name, it has market cap and investors. Again, it will take a *disaster* for it to die.

Took me some google searching. When the demand for bonds is so high, the bond seller can start charging people interest instead of paying them interest. This is mainly happening because people strongly want to hold money in foreign safe havens, to the point that they will pay interest to hold a bond. So it's pretty much specific countries getting a ton of bidders from other nations with less stable economies.

I don't feel like I necessarily deserve any huge gains, so while my instinct is to feel regret for not putting more in before, I'm also thankful I may get anything at all. I put a little bit at a time like you said; just what I'd be willing to lose and nothing more. Unfortunately there wasn't really ever a time for me to invest more than a few hundred dollars due to bills. So yeah, the moral here is we don't deserve this and anything we get, be thankful for.

I think it's worth investing a good amount now at 8k (or at dips to 6k) and then in increments later, holding. BTC should become more stable in the long run which will allow it to act as sort of a store of value or savings. 
Wait a few days to see how 8k holds. If it holds for a week with good buying demand, or goes to 8.5k+ anytime soon then it's a good sign, but we might see a dip back to 5.5-6k which could be an even better buying opportunity. I do think this is a bull run though, so it should be fun.
I've been looking for signs that maybe even 10k is a bubble that brings us down to 4k again. I'm not sure honestly. Many accumulated at 4k and want decent gains, and many including rich buyers FOMOd at 6-7k. Something tells me the short term will bring us 15k with heavy resistance by rich selloffs. If we survive that, may jebus have mercy on exchanges.
