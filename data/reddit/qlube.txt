Alternatively, the people who are ideologically aligned with the bitcoin community are also the most confident about its price, and perhaps most of those people are in the US.

It's not backed by anything.  So it is kind of strange that a lot of "goldbugs" are now Bitcoin enthusiasts.

It's not that hard to see what is going on.  Most people holding Bitcoin were doing it for the gains, not because it's useful as a currency or because the technology is interesting.  This is pretty apparent even reading enthusiast subreddits like here, where most discussions were about Bitcoin's price (e.g. HODL), not the technology (or the problems with it).
So for all the people holding Bitcoin as an investment, when the price goes down from one single bad news, a lot of those people are going to cut their losses (or perhaps say they've gained enough).  Which further reduces the price and causes even more people to sell.
The question is, how many of them are going to come back?  And how many new people are going to invest?  Now those answers nobody knows.  But if Bitcoin can't be shown to be a sound long-term investment, then maybe not that many.

Yes, that's how markets work, and so you're correct it won't crash to $0.  But that doesn't preclude the possibility if it crashing to $1.  I don't think it's likely given that ultimately there is some actual use for bitcoin, but the fact that every sold bitcoin is a bought bitcoin doesn't alone preclude any particular price aside from $0.

Casuals are also what raised the price.

Speculating on bitcoin prices is equivalent to gambling.  If it's not an amount you're willing to gamble with at a casino, don't do it.

Ask yourself this.  You say you need the $8k.  Well, that also means you really need the $4k.  Let's say there's a 50/50 chance between you recovering the $4k you've lost, and you losing all of it.
Would you rather cash out now or risk what you have to a coin flip?
And 50/50 is just a number I made up, nobody really knows what's going to happen (but $20k seems unlikely).  Do you really have the risk appetite to be gambling with money you need?

I'm just disputing that we don't know what's going on.  We know what's going on.  We just don't know what will happen in the future.

If you're gonna sell, better to sell at the beginning of this year than at the end of last year, since tax on the gains will be due a year later.

What's wrong with eating soy?  Asian-Americans have higher incomes and lower unemployment than white Americans, so sounds like it's working.

Who owns the Federal Reserve is not a particularly relevant question.  The decisions of the Fed are made by the Board of Governors who are mostly civil servants nominated by the President and appointed by the Senate.  There is no mechanism that would allow the nominal owners of the Fed to use that ownership to affect the decision making of the Board of Governors.  This is in contrast to a typical corporation whose shareholders directly vote for the board.

What's the point of this bet?  If you want to bet bitcoin will be higher in a year, why not just buy bitcoin?

Not really, they release pretty detailed minutes for all their meetings, and their primary policy tool, adjusting the targeted federal funds rate, is completely transparent.  
@_date: 2014-04-03 20:43:20
Whether or not any of that is true, who the shareholders of the FRB are is irrelevant once you understand how the Fed makes decisions.

It limits the power of the federal government.  The Constitution was intended to take away some power from the state governments, which have the general police power, and give it to the federal government.
Nowadays some portions of the Constitution have been amended/interpreted to also limit the power of the state governments.  But the general rule still holds: State governments have a general police power, whereas the Federal government does not.

Hearsay is any out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.  Doesn't matter if it's probative.  (If it wasn't probative, then it could be excluded on grounds of relevancy or prejudice.)

Hearsay: "out of court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted"
From a legal perspective, hearsay actually covers a ton of things normal people might otherwise consider to be pretty reliable evidence.  Emails, for example.  Or newspaper articles.  Or even scientific papers.  But that is also why there's a long, long list of exceptions to the "general" rule that hearsay is inadmissible (and also why the topic of hearsay takes up the majority of.  For example, a confession note by the defendant is hearsay, but could be admissible because it's against his interest and/or is a witness statement.  
Note that whether the interview is *authentic* is also another hurdle before evidence can be admitted. PGP signed message would be quite relevant to the issue of authentication, and at a trial, you'd probably bring in an expert to testify about how a PGP signed message means it's a very high likelihood of being DPR.
But as for the the statements made in the interview, if being offered to prove that what he said is true?  That's all hearsay.  And inadmissible unless you can get the "real" DPR to come to court and testify about them.
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:01:47


It's not just that, though authentication is also a hurdle especially with pseudonymous interviews.  Even if we were 100% sure that the interview was conducted with DPR, because Ulbricht is denying he is DPR, those statements are not made by anyone who can be called to testify at trial (so that there's a chance to cross-examine the declarant and also authenticate the statements).  Classic hearsay; it's the reason why the hearsay rule even exists.

How does buying bitcoin and then holding help bitcoin, like at all?  I would think the most important thing a regular person could do is to buy and sell things with bitcoin.  Like actual transactions with bitcoin, not those services that merely convert bitcoin to fiat.
People who are interested in the technology and philosophy should be doing whatever they can to create a bitcoin-based economy.  A bunch of people sitting on bitcoin hoping for the price (relative to fiat!!!) to go up is not an economy, it's just a pyramid scheme driven by people who care more about getting rich with fiat.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:02:15
They aren't selling things with it.  They're selling things in fiat.  You're not really buying things with it either, you're just using an automated process where you sell your BTC for fiat and then buy the thing using that fiat.
Very, very few transactions involving BTC involve a seller who wants to keep the BTC to buy something later.

$3m isn't *that* much for a house, a family with an annual income of $500k could afford it by financing it.  Yeah that's rich, but not filthy rich, plenty of Silicon Vally engineers make that much (by the way, $3m in Palo Alto gets you a tiny 2000 square foot house, not a palazzo).
 
Usually the seller won't care if the buyer is paying all cash or financing it as long as the purchase is not conditioned on financing going through.  A buyer can promise that lack of condition if they're confident their financial situation is sound enough for the mortgage to be granted.
But if the seller only wants bitcoin, then those who want to finance the purchase are pretty much out of luck because no bank is going to be willing to convert the cash into bitcoin.
And even if I as a buyer wanted to do all-cash, I would be very reluctant to pay by directly transferring him bitcoin.  I'd want to use an escrow (like it's done for nearly all housing purchases), but is there even an escrow company that would accept bitcoin?  Plus, between the time you transfer the bitcoin to the escrow and the deal closes (maybe up to a month), the value of the bitcoin could greatly fluctuate.  The seller/buyer better be negotiating a price in terms of bitcoin, not fiat, otherwise someone is going to get fucked.

All you have to do is point out that almost everyone, including the person you're talking to, wasn't in it for the fundamentals, they're in it for the speculation.  Which means it's a bubble waiting to pop.
If you're buying BTC at $15k hoping it will go up to $20k so you can make an easy buck, that's speculation, not wanting to buy BTC because of its utility.  Just looking at what people in this sub were mostly discussing for the past ~6 months and that much was obvious.
