Well that was proven wrong, spectacularly.

They also had insurance. Lol.

The moment they open the floodgates everyone and his mother will cause a rush on withdrawals. Their name and business is trash.
Hopefully most regular people get the majority of their funds back and then someone sues them into the ground anyway.

So why Multibit over the default?
Looks nice, does it do anything else other then multiple wallets?
Genuinely curious but couldn't get much info from the site on the differences.
@_date: 2014-01-02 09:51:42
Only one flaw in your plan.
It's never sunny in Melbourne.
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:26:11
What I don't get is, why is an attack not already happening on the various altcoins today?
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:33:17
I say, take a little bit and buy yourself a shitbox car while you're young and it doesn't matter how it goes or what it looks like.
The rest I would invest somehow. Keep in mind that Bitcoin is pure speculation and very much a gamble, that it might also not be the best investment for you.
@_date: 2014-01-15 00:31:23
Yeah that prank just backfired spectacularly.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:36:35
So is the potential loss..

I assume 100% that we are getting Goxed.

Poor guy OP.

Religious nut who has apparently spammed the blockchain with religious quotes.
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:12:02
And this is not a scam, how?
@_date: 2017-02-03 02:57:09
This is the first time a direct service has ever been available in these countries including mine. Prior to now you could only go via slightly dodgy local means or via the 2 maybe working ATMs 1000s of miles away.
I'm actually fairly excited by the opportunity despite the fees involved. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:19:38
Well it is about money, that's the whole topic being discussed here.
These kinds of features don't make Reddit any better then it already is and can be found on other social media sites if wanted. 
Reddit is capable of creating communities the way it is, look at subs like (and its spin-offs like and as well as the bazillion other special interest subs that exist. Just because they don't always meet up in real life doesn't make them any less of a community. .
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:12:05
I've sat in a similar meeting at a past employer once. It's simply insane what people assume is ok because of the buzzword "cloud", until it's too late and the business is without its DC.
@_date: 2015-01-11 00:53:06
Not automatically bad, but does have a few large negatives that you need to account for that costs quite a bit of money to mitigate properly. These are often ignored as cloud migrations are commonly justified on saving money instead of protecting the business better. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:54:47
The thing is, the features you listed wouldn't be useful to me. It's all subjective depending on what your might expect from Reddit. 
I prefer Reddit to remain semi-anonymous and I don't want to know about other Redditers around me, there are other websites and platforms for that. I would be concerned about my privacy at the very least.
For instance, "hey Brokenskill, there are 500 people and 2 regular posters in your area that like would you like to be added to a list of them?" Erm.. no thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:44:49
I'm actually OK with them not making major changes in the name of monetizing Reddit. At the moment Reddit is a simple and mostly advert free social media platform that I enjoy using; if it were to start shoving paid upgrades and special deals in my face I would get sick of it pretty quickly.
@_date: 2016-11-10 05:44:52
Nice. Also 100% more then I could afford sadly.
@_date: 2016-11-10 22:02:41
I will try not to let you down and will govern for all of Reddit.

I commented but I never actually expected him to pay.
Calling him out is fine though.
@_date: 2015-07-03 13:25:04
Thank god for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-10 04:54:58
This is why Reddit's he-who-came-here-first moderation system is horribly broken. 
Thanks for the post and raising awareness despite the stupid going on here.
@_date: 2015-07-03 13:29:14
Was a hobby project for a couple of students that just happen to gain a following due to disgruntled Reddit users knocking on their door.
Up until the first Reddit exodus, the entire thing including IIS and SQL Server were hosted on a single box. They were not expecting or prepared for this.
@_date: 2015-07-03 13:24:28
Unless I can insert my credit card so that they can receive Bitcoin then just the address is fine.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:47:46
Ghost written essentially.
@_date: 2015-09-06 06:50:26
Yes it did. They were legitimate files including the following:
* ..\ScryptMinerGUI\minerd.exe
* ..\Pooler-CPUMiner\minderd.exe
* ..\Dogecoin-QT\minerd.exe
The More Info link sends you to the link I posted. The reason is "Could be a Trojan horse Bitcoin".
My assumption is they recently updated their detection database to find anything like minerd.exe = someone mining Bitcoin using your PC unknowingly to you.
@_date: 2015-09-06 09:01:26
No not so far, just nailed the minerd.exe and similar files from all the clients and mining tools. 
Some of these I've had around for a long time when GPU mining was semi-viable.
@_date: 2015-09-06 07:11:45
You trust your AV to keep you safe and if you are a non-technical user interested in this Bitcoin thing it's pretty easy to take those warnings at face value. Further the more info link straight-up tells you Bitcoin is nasty. 
Even worse is the default setting when AVG does a scan is to remove the files it detects to protect you. So those files are gone for me now.
@_date: 2015-04-28 13:58:31
This crappy article requires a subscription to read the details. Anyone got an actual link to said exchange or a good article about it?
@_date: 2015-09-07 01:15:00
I was with him up until Linyx
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:25:09
Getting something of value out of it is a great incentive. Just like mining, running a node should give something back to the person running the node to encourage people to run them.
@_date: 2015-03-01 07:38:21
If this were like some 2D minigame that ties into EVE on my phone when I'm on the crapper I might consider playing it. By itself it resembles PC games from 20 years ago. 
I can't believe someone payed you a million bucks to make this rubbish!
@_date: 2016-05-04 12:41:08
This guy is doing it wrong. We here all know the best way to steal cash legally from the Australian tax payer is to either run or be mates with the guy who runs the main telco.
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:36:43
It must be a Dell officer, they run really really hot!
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:45:16
I would also like to apply. 
I only know how to install Bitcoin and throw a few scripts together to make it work with a website I can make with WordPress. My lack of skills will make it very easy to justify being hacked one day and cost almost nothing for you to get your exchange off the ground. I can also make a great logo using industry standard tools such as MS Paint.
All I ask is for a few percent of the profits you make when you, erm, decide to shut it down. I can have this ready for production use in a matter of hours should you wish to choose me.
@_date: 2015-02-05 05:13:09
Wow. I can't wait to see someone test this defense in a court. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:58:00
I can run my MS Paint creation through an online free Flash generator, will that suffice?
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:31:18
Crap. I guess I should have mentioned my PHD in Digital Currency then..
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:44:29
Or just set up a thermite bomb on top of your HDD with a kill switch tied to your arm. That way when the feds pin you down your incriminating evidence just melts away.
@_date: 2015-02-05 04:50:10
So are you saying that you aren't responsible for the random data in the free space on your hard disk?
@_date: 2015-02-05 05:11:35
Your reading comprehension is lacking. I am getting an enormous chuckle from your responses though.
@_date: 2015-02-05 04:56:09
The problem here is that you are relying on assumptions and things you are reading on the net. Your choice ultimately. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 05:25:23
I love people who make me laugh. I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person.
@_date: 2015-02-05 04:20:48
Hidden volumes remaining hidden? To the untrained eye sure.
Their data forensic specialists would no doubt have a field day with it.
@_date: 2015-02-05 04:34:46
I think, that you should go read the articles you linked to. The first one for example highlights that hidden volumes are farily insecure. 
The only magic here is the belief that this would actually keep you safe. Especially with Truecript, which again if you read the first article you linked is discontinued. Do a quick Google seaech to find out why; if you are currently relying on it you might not want to after that.
@_date: 2015-02-05 12:26:58
It's not really a bomb as such, [more like this](
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:40:10
I have to wonder what option would have actually been easier for Ross. 
Also, they do strongly encourage you to hand over your keys or just find you guilty anyway. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:52:06
I find it interesting that the main exchange for Bitcoin is, as you say, a dieing company.
I'm also not concerned about Coinbase stealing my money which is why I mentioned the VC. I'm more concerned linking my bank account with funds I rely on to eat and live to an online service that exposes that to being potentially hacked. See Sony hack etc
@_date: 2017-06-30 07:12:52
Glad it all worked out for dad in the end. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:54:35
If you sent him a cake with a file in it instead of just sending the file is it any less illegal?
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:18:19
Non US.
Not sending money to random site X is pretty much an unwritten rule when using the internet, you young whippersnappers have yet to learn the hard way :P
BTW I'm a Nigerian prince and I need to stash my 50 billion Bitcoins in your bank account. If you help me I'll give you a 50% cut. Pls send details.

Hey Indonesia. Spoiler alert. Trend didn't continue in China.
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:14:09
I think the purists will rag on it as it dilutes the purpose of Bitcoin somewhat vs Amazon actually accepting them.
I like the idea though, it doesn't sound difficult to implement it just has some financial risk to you I assume. I'm gonna go install and check it out.
 
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:49:28
There has been a few people saying the same thing, selective scamming, about a couple of sites now.
This can only hurt adoption of Bitcoin in the long run. Maybe it's time to petition Snoop Lion or Richard Branson to set up a trustworthy deposit service!
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:48:13
Checked this one out, supports more then just Canada which is nice. Unfortunately they have a very limited selection of banks they do support, only the major ones which excludes me from their services.
Also, in their FAQ: no refunds.
Thanks for the link though!
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:45:23
It's like walking around handing out Linux CDs as Christmas gifts.
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:29:21
I wonder how many are simply holding it because the owner has this new hobby called "Bitcoins" and is exchanging buying a them with this.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:11:13
Just go to  and you will not only learn how to use Bitcoins but will get some to start with!
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:11:34
So can our drug dealer.
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:25:08
So we are screwed when the banks wise up and release their own crypto currency to fix the issues with Bitcoin then?
This is what I took away from the article for some reason. It's a set up :p
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:04:26
There's more talk of it already.
Also there is the fact that we are now doomed to consume the internet only through pipes as tight as Abbots arse hole for the rest of eternity also limits what we can do. 
Download the blockchain again through the hole if you don't believe me..
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:00:38
Damn beatniks.
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:10:57
Reminds me of all those people who get burned trying to buy gold for their MMO from some shady forum or website and lose their money. Banks don't see that as legitimate either.
Sadly most avenues for dealing with Bitcoin currently resemble the same shady characteristics of buying MMO gold such as foreign payment gateways of dubious reliability just on a grander and higher stakes level. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:13:03
Maybe a good option in a hurry, but was hoping for something a bit better then a piece of paper.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:58:40
I'd have to get off my butt to get a gift card first, but I like the idea of this service for the fact I hate having funds stuck on gift cards with no other way to get a refund from them.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:06:20
This is an interesting way to publicise a website. I've never heard of it before now.
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:35:59
Outside US.
Looking at all the options including both of those to determine viability. Going into it I wasn't aware of the restrictions on some of those services, only that the services existed and checked them out. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:56:42
Once I have them in my wallet I'm fine, I would like a refund or some protection if the transaction gets screwed up beyond my reasonable ability to control it.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:13:47
Glad the dealer was reputable, I don't know if I'd be sending my wife and baby to see a stranger to convert some bitcoin to cash.
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:52:49
Or the worlds biggest troll when he does cash them all out and makes a killing.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:54:46
Thanks for the encouragement!
Bitcoin are extremely hard to obtain if you don't already have them first. It's why I'd love to see Bitcoin succeed in the long term, if only getting started was made far easier by the traditional banking systems.
