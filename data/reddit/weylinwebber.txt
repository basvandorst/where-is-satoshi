I am, I’m 21 live with my grandparents and am able to save a considerable amount due to that. I have 10% of my savings in BTC, 10% in ETH and then I got a Litecoin to top it off. The rest of my savings I am planing to put into a ROTH IRA. I’m still new to this but do you thing that’s a good choice? I mean I can put more of it to BTC but I don’t know if it will keep going up 20% in a day like this.

Here’s to hopefully retiring some day
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:09:05
Ok still very new to this, what is a brokerage account with a three fund portfolio? (I’m assuming stocks split into three companies?)
And I’m just looking into a roth now, I have no idea how it works to be perfectly honest.

@_date: 2017-12-06 12:55:52
I promised my dad if it made it to 20k I’d sell half my shares (because he’s afraid I’ll lose everything) looks like I’m going to be a liar...
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:47:57
