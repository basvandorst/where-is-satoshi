When/If this process is mastered, it sounds more likely that it won't involve cold temperatures at all. Removing all of the energy from a living creature sounds like a good way to kill it to me.

What if the laws that make my endeavour illegal were bought politically and I simply disagree that my victimless crime resulting in profit should be illegal at all? An obvious example is selling marijuana to someone with glaucoma or any illness that causes lack of appetite to the point of harm? Criminal today, community supported taxpayer tomorrow.
If you haven't seen enough of this world yet to make your own decisions on which laws are just, and which you feel confident ignoring than you must be the last person alive who hasn't downloaded music or rolled through a stop sign at 2am.

Hmmph. I suppose it makes sense. It's much easier to extend someone's trust instead of establish new trust. 
That said though, I'm going to take my business to the institution that makes it easy as hell for me to find information on services I need when I need them and does it's damndest to provide the best rates. If I know my bank is providing the best rates, why would I go anywhere else?
My biggest banking pet peeve in my region is the fact that when you become an adult usually the bank still thinks you're a delinquent - deposit delays, credit denial, ect. For both me and my wife(who has 100% beautiful credit history), it took a bank swap to finally get treated like we're valued as opposed to doubted.

Let alone the fact that seller protection is a farse allowing $450+ to be defrauded from my accounts.

I'm not sure I understand why deflation is a bad thing. Or, more importantly a *worse* thing than inflation. If the buying power of my currency increases over time, that doesn't all of a sudden grant me immunity to having to eat, or work, or pay for a home. And if every grocer on my block is lowering the price of food because the currency we all use is increasing in scarsity &amp; buying power that doesn't sound like a problem to me. Especially since the scarcity is being caused by losses from other people I'm not depending on.
But if my government prints more currency my buying power decreases because of decisions I had no say in, and see no direct financial changes from except harship since the baker is also finding himself a little poorer and has to raise prices.
Inflation wouldn't be an issue if my employer would promise to negate it's effect by scaling my pay. I suppose in a deflationary economic system regular salary adjustments would also be nessecary to prevent my employer from going out of business due to the increasing costs of paying employees.
It all comes down to how we're measuring the value of a bitcoin. It still needs to look to the world reserve currency to establish a reference to compare value to due to the extreme fluctuations, and it will stay that way until we can all live an existence paying and getting paid 100% in btc. Until we get to that point claiming bitcoin is unstable as an economic structure is pretty accurate. But just ask any japanese citizen how they feel about their YEN in their savings account about how their inflationary system provides them with a sense of stability and confidence...
Eventually both systems reveal that a global culture based on greed &amp; personal wealth is a little depressing rightsideup and upsidedown.

Perhaps they won't ever if they adopt to the regional needs within their industry. That'd be nice actually.
I always wondered why the hell Blockbuster allowed itself to die the way it did. I assumed that the owner didn't have an heir to leave the empire to, and figured he'd be comfortable as hell for the rest of his life after selling all the real estate - why innovate if the rewards for your efforts is enough to retire for a century?

Fucking christ this shit pisses me off. Why the fuck does my bank need to make SALES at all? They've already GOT my money - just fucking invest it behind my back and make a fortune off HOLDING my cash. Fuck banks man. Fuck banks.

It's called totally fucked since it's a service everyone needs to participate in the economy. Let me guess; you voted for the red tie and think privately owned prisons or hospitals is a reasonable idea.

I never understood this logic. Trading doesn't usually result in a winner and a loser. It results in a net profit, or a net loss.
If someone elses bot is MORE profitable, so be it. But if yours is performing better than buy and hold, why not?

To address your second paragraph; I just don't have the brain to ever accept "Trust me" as a good reason to believe anything. And I'm sure the great wizard will forgive me for not showing my gratitude for saving me from the pitfalls of a system I've no say in and did not choose.
I'm going to go look up that spiral thingey now.. cuz wizdom.

It's not really. The big deal lies in how the individuals who trust large banking institutes with their wealth have no say in policy.

In canada my checkbook has one use - writing VOID overtop a cheque and handing to an employer that wants my direct deposit information.

I don't doubt it. I hope the current crypto evolution of currency destroys these geezer bankers. Here's hoping Chase becomes synonymous to Blockbuster in 4 years.

It's only a good time to buy if you can sit there and watch the charts drop another $200 and hold your coins like a boss. I believe we'll see much higher one day, but I also believe we'll see much lower first.
Buy them and forget about them or don't buy at all. they WILL drop, your investment WILL be in the red - just don't sell and you haven't ever accepted a loss.

Just split your wallet in half. Trade with one half, hodl the other half and see how you do

Would a block of say 50 really high-fee transactions take less time to complete?
Mining is a bit of a race, right? if I were mining an identical block as the next person, the first processor to confirm and add to the chain reaps the rewards?
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:12:34
oh.... so why the hell would someone want to mine a half-full block? wouldn't that be a bit of a dick move? wouldn't serve to discriminate against transactions of certain criteria to the detriment of the miner?
I believe the individual I was referencing in my original question was mining Bitcoin Cash. Would it be possible that during that time there weren't enough transactions to fill a block?
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:04:10
worth NOTHING? or worth much less since half the TX's were already completed?
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:52:10
I see.
Right. So when you say "get included in the next block" the blockchain itself is preparing the ne... nope. I should really read the whitepaper at this point.
like why are 0.5mb blocks available at all? 
@_date: 2017-09-10 07:08:50
Thanks. I will
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:46:32
So I'm confused again. How would a miner be processing a block of transactions that was less than half full?
How are these blocks... 'packaged' and distributed?
I feel like that's a loaded question, but I want to understand.
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:26:32
I guess in the past I thought everyone had identical blocks in the queue to mine. First to the finish line wins. Next block.
But if you can make your own blocks of only high value transactions... what if:
Miner A starts mining a full sized block.
Miner B starts mining a half-sized block, opting to confirm only the highest 50% of transactions which are also included in Miner A's block.
If Miner B finishes first, would Miner A only be rewarded for the unconfirmed transactions at the time of completion since Miner B confirmed half of Miner A's transactions before he could?
Or would Miner A's entire block be garbage, since some transactions weren't verified, but some were already?

I never got the hang of trading on leveraged bitcoin markets because the whales do such a good job of forcing a margin call in just a few minutes.
@_date: 2015-11-28 05:28:01
It's called shorting. Professional traders don't give a fuck which direction the markets go, they make money in both directions. Just gotta catch the waves
@_date: 2015-11-25 22:40:17
Is there a way to make the deposit addresses a Bitcoin protocol link so either the blockchain app on my phone, or in another tab is called to handle the transaction? This could be made more useful with an input box that could prepopulate the amount.
If I'm betting from my phone it's a real challenge to close the chart, copy the gumlet address, get to the wallet, fill a transaction in time for a critical 2m or 15m opportunity.
Do the deposit addresses ever change? I could add them as favorites in my wallet I suppose.

The fact that money holds value is what makes it successful. Nobody would have services or products to offer for money that could not translate into real world food, water, shelter. As such, very few people actually care about money and instead really just care about food, water, and shelter because it's life sustaining and requires money to trade for.

Anything without moderation is harmful. How fast you travel in your car, how many chicken wings you care to eat, how many beers you drink.
I understand your point - that a drug addict has a higher chance of being a dangerous individual but I don't agree that using drugs make a person's nature sour.
In my experience the type of people that sell street narcotics need to be sought out, they don't go announcing themselves and pushing product on communities. Infact quite the opposite. They want as little attention as possible, and need to be introduced by a mutual contact.
On the other hand [alcohol death numbers]( are pretty staggaring to look at and in [2010, 60% of all overdose deaths were from perscription painkillers](
Surely my beer vendor or pharmacy isn't a community liability.
@_date: 2013-07-19 04:20:54
As someone who's worked in a gas station before and sold tobacco to my community, that's still a pretty unfortunate generalization.
@_date: 2013-07-19 05:40:13
So what about the owner of the beer vendor?
