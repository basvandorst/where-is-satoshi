I love bitcoin and I'm hodler but I have no strings attached, so I keep an eye on potential alternatives. I have no doubt satoshi brought a huge contribution to the world, but some people are dumb enough to think it's the ultimate solution and no alternative can come with a better solution as I have seen on bitcoin foruns quite religiously. That's just not how world works at all. Look at the internet history itself.

What you're saying is that bitcoin shouldn't be available and affordable for everyone? There are actually altcoins with great concept improvements and they might take over bitcoin if it comes handy for mass adoption in a proper time-to-market frame. Bitcoin does need improvements and you can't deny stakeholders. If improvements go live in time it'll definitely stay on top for ages. It's not back then when bitcoin was for few venture people in low volume. Wake up, bitcoin is open and people will use it however they want. Bitcoin needs evolution just as any other techonolgy does.

We've been told for ages that OUR money is safer with OTHER institutions (AKA government/banks). In general we are a brainwashed legacy generation that is slowly waking up about how money should work and how it should be used. 
*MONEY IS ONLY YOURS IF YOU CONTROL IT*
After so many crisis, crashes, hyperinflations and now the opportunity of controlling your own money, we've come to a great new disruptive technology that is taking place and will change how finance runs and reorder cash controls. We are experiencing it at the quite very beginning. It will take time to people educate itself, but so did people take time to learn about Internet and contribute to its evolution.
Exciting times.
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:58:15
All that you claim is considering a smaller altcoin. It's easy to say *Then why has Bitcoin not got it's LN yet?* when Bitcoin has 16x market cap, plus way bigger network, volume, etc. And it does now suffer from political reasons and other stuff. When you guys reach this big, tell me how you going to fix your bugs reaching a good and not damaging consensus . It's easier to change when it's smaller, when you go big you face bigger problems and barriers. I'm not disregarding ethereum in any way, they have their good solutions, but you don't need much to make a decision happen right now. You just can't compare this way.
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:25:44
I dont think you understand the concept of bitcoin quite right. Dedicate some time to read about bitcoin and its history so far and you'll know why people pay for it. And I have to say: if you still see bitcoin as a pyramid scheme then search what banks do with your money, what they've done over history and you might find why bitcoin was introduced.
@_date: 2017-02-18 02:45:22
I've been studying bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) outside here and it had been all technical stuff, which is not bad, but the r/bitcoin is like real state of bitcoin and its community (so does r/btc, but a little less because it's smaller). It's like reading books and you come here and boom.. real life. You get practical with bitcoin and learn a lot about all multidisciplinary stuff that it involves. I second your thanks.
@_date: 2017-02-13 00:05:57
"a complementary cryptocoin" that you're claiming doesn't exist yet. And if they get a massive adoption right away, they're gonna be in trouble too. The people who almost say"*oh my gosh bitcoin is failing*" doesn't take in consideration the bitcoin is over 86% market cap today, bigger network, bigger community, bigger issues and so on. Bitcoin does have solutions for small payments and scaling issues. But I personally think that these solutions can be done step-by-step. Maybe segwit first and then block size increase with proper testing
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:52:32
no need to worry. also, altcoin pumpers are already taking their profits right now. big dump happening at this moment
@_date: 2017-02-03 23:50:18
I have a personal alternative feeling that another crypto might rise for small daily payments if bitcoin itself or other third-party solution don't come with a good solution or consensus. I have seen people ignoring altcoins as if they were irrelevant, but there are good solutions out there and if big companies put a massive effort to make it happen for everyone there will be a big game changing. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 00:40:43
Now you made your point and i got it. It's definitely an immature product and I'm very excited about the concept in general and what can bring to our future.
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:46:28
I personally think we need a clean 2 to 8mb block increase HF. Core has built a pretty good stable implementation of Bitcoin and everyone agrees on it. Jumping to 8mb could be too much, but a least could get classic support and a big chunk from BU and clear this backlog for some years, then everyone can think about others/older issues and get back to solving it, like segwit, flexible tx, and other solutions that may come with them. Bitcoin can't handle peaks right now and it's very vulnerable to spammers. Bitcoin needs a breath asap
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:37:15
aren't the big miners rich? they have pretty much control over bitcoin growth now
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:28:36
Did they really need it? I like bitsquare :/
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:07:24
I couldn't agree more. Why not propose this HF so bitcoin gets some breath time and devs can code without twitter notifications spams on their phones. I believe Core can deliver a simpler/better approach to reach consensus from everyone. I wish I could read the code and make the necessary tweaks to deliver it in time.

There's a [Core Capacity Increase FAQ]( from 2015, which is pretty clear and it can answer most of your questions. And there's the [capacity roadmap]( that's worth reading and very clarifying too.
Once I have read it I had no doubt about that we're in fact under some kind of attack, there's no need for such a contentious hard-fork right now. Also, backlogs are pretty low and fees are getting back to normal, it seems the storm is gone for a while.
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:17:33
I don't think it will reverse. Altcoins pumps are overbought, backlog has been 'cleared' for more than a week, FUD is fading away. We can talk about scaling again without altcoin pumps, name calling and twitter senseless whining. I also think the spammers have run out of money. So there you go.
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:45:31
Yeah, core roadmap should be stickied. So all newcomers can read it right away before taking any misleading opinion (i was one of them)

There's an altcoin called NEM(XEM) that considers the importance of a node - they call it POI, Proof of Importance -  in the network and it doesn't only count the amount that it has, but also txs, activities and other stuff. I'm sure there are others with somehow similar approach, but NEM is the one I can remember now.
@_date: 2017-02-13 01:25:01
my body is ready
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:23:30
I follow your statement and I'd love to see segwit getting accepted by most miners so we could move on to new challenges. 
But you're ignoring the fact the we have a *slight* disagreement between BU and SW supporters. I know segwit brings a block size increase but that's too low for almost the other half, so why not try getting a consensus instead of dragging this to a contentious hard fork? I know BU has poor/no plans for a clean HF and they bear the most part of the contentious buzzword. But I haven't seen both sides trying to get something like a meeting to settle an agreement, put this in code and get this block size increase done that was predicted years ago. A clean block size increase HF supported by a majority would not damage bitcoin at all and I know you know that.
About the the spam origin: we may never know, but what if it could be even a scientific test or whatever purpose to do so? who knows? Spamming the network with low fees is actually not *that expensive* and it was even cheaper a while ago and it drags who really wants to use bitcoin, for what was designed to, to pay higher fees.
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:45:30
It wasn't random. There was no limit initially but at the very beginning of bitcoin it was pretty easy and cheap to spam large blocks and damage the network, that's why he did it at that time and it worked till last year. He stated himself that the limit should never be reached.

Nice suggestion, that would be nice. Maybe a long and open debate could bring some sane arguments and a common agreement. I don't think either side wants bitcoin to fail, they just have different approaches to scale. All this low 'quality twitter war' is not helping at all. I really wish they could set a debate where they could reach a common sense. I think it's worth trying (Maybe I'm being just too innocent, but that'd be nice if happened)

wait, what? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:18:44
I think core should restate/adjust their roadmap now that segwit is activated and publish as much as they can. A blocksize increase will be needed in future and they need to reassure that they or other devs or reasearchers are working on it to make it safe and clean.
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:55:46

LN may be functioning but not production ready, no one knows when an average joe will be able to use it.
I support segwit but to reach this capacity it has to process all current/incoming standard txs (aka clean the increasing backlog), and then expect everyone magically switch to segwit addresses, this will take time.
I belive if segwit + 2mb HF is supported by Core(release code and support) then it would address a lot of current issues like miner support, immediate onchain capacity bump and segwit advantages.

China exchanges were the most famous ones for a long time until the beginning of this year, when PBOC took actions, so the price crashed. Bots create false demand, thus creating FOMO or the illusion there's actually some volume going on, so poor human beings often fall and buy the trap. Aka, buy high, sell low.

I fear this was a perfect lesson. Cryptocurrencies in general should not be ruled by a single man announcement, we already have this: corporations, banks, governments, etc. And yes, this is kinda happening in bitcoin right now, but I believe we are in a different warning situation so some actions I take as necessary. Overall, these single man announcements just work for traders and speculators. Real hodlers and crypto believers live for what cryptocurrencies really empowers, so they just buy it, use it and help the community as they can or see fit. I'm not pumping it but monero has been implementing interesting concepts and all this helps the crypto space.

Litecoin has 4x onchain capacity and miners don't even need to bother about onchain scaling and probably for decades now, they had no excuse to activate it.
Is a block size HF really that skeptical if "both sides" agree and move forward? 'Cause it seems there's a contentious HF/UASF coming. What's more dangerous for you and the network?

Stop this HF FUD. In case it were that dangerous with a majority support, which is more dangerous than the situation now, a contentious EC/BU HF? UASF? Those are all jokes for me, pushing pressures for each sides, still keeping the stalemate and contentiousness.
2mb will give extra room for tx just as 1.7mb segwit will eventually  do. Whats the deal?

Was Satoshi a big blocker then? I'm not saying that Satoshi is a god or something, but the need of a block size increase was "supported" and clear for him.

You got the idea.
No solution will be perfect for all stakeholders, one side has to give up something and I'm sure it'll not hurt bitcoin if an agreement is done. 
Besides that, if the network goes full again, which probably wouldn't happen anytime soon with SW+2mb non witness data, it will be clear (more than now) that 2nd layer solutions will be the way to go for big flows of tx/s. There's no way bitcoin can scale only onchain.
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:57:21
Sorry, but this is no medicine, it's mostly math. Txs are becoming unreliable and/or unpredictable, the limit has literally been reached. But still, it feels like some are just holding a block size increase for non-contextual reasons when all sides can benefit from it.

I get you, but the thing is I'm feeling miners will really go for the 2x part. You should not reject them, there's also some economic services backing it up and don't forget users too! As a community/users we should really support the 2x part. It's a fair compromise in my view and the tradeoffs are negligible
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:34:33


There's no such thing to be called contentious right now. It's actually being discussed the viability of it.


This would be needed if the contentious part were to be proven right now.


Indeed, it would. But there's some really movement about it and Core does not seem to be neglecting it, which is important for the development. We might see more nodes being switched or added to the network as a response to the S2X development and its viability or not. The thing is to discuss it, not blindly reject it.
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:13:27
Regardless of it, you should get more info about the technology, which is being proven (until now) to be resistant to propagandas and censorship.

He's right. I'm a bitcoin believer and bitcoin is changing the world, so I bought. Early adopters will surely profit, but by using a valued bitcoin, not dollars. Late adopters *might* hopefully profit like 1% a year cause bitcoin will be a stable currency. 
So either you're missing the point of bitcoin or you're terrible trader and should stay out of bitcoin.

How to not worry if they split taking the majority hash power? It'll be a mess and we would have to hard fork anyway. What's the point of it?
For a moment take LTC as example, whose miners didn't have to worry much about capacity. Besides the script and the UASF pressure, they had no excuse for bigger blocks besides going for segwit. So what's the excuse to not give 2mb non-witness data for bitcoin, even back then on HK agreement?
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:07:27
Segwit + 2x is what miners are ok to go since 2 years ago. If say 80-100% (currently &gt;90%) miners go for the 2x part, Core will probably have to merge the new rules. The things is, this is open source, no one has control over bitcoin :) You seem to have too much strings attached. BIP148 is one proof of that, it didn't need Core's permission to get it 15% portion of the network
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:53:42
They can't even use both because it's bugged AF. I imagine a mess when a node flash crash happens due to their incompetence, but this time it's different because they can't rely on "Core" anymore to fix or review their code and they will have nearly 100% of nodes to crash and kill themselves

@_date: 2017-07-27 18:45:18
Take the 2x part: The most likely case I see is that most miners are going to the 2x HF. If they don't there'll be a natural split. However, if let's say &gt;95% miners go for the 2x part, current incompatible nodes will have to upgrade to the new consensus rules, otherwise they won't be able to transact. That's it. 
Have in mind that Segwit2x is the best opportunity to avoid a contentious split on Bitcoin and it has the most widespread "support" I've seen. I still can't understand why some devs are against this. IMHO they should support the 2x part so all the community would only benefit from it

@_date: 2017-07-31 17:04:55
Does it matter? Segwit2x is a simple code fork and there's no roadmap after a hypothetical success. Also hypothetically, Core can merge the new rule set and continue their roadmap development, one does not block the other. People often forget it's an open source system
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:50:31

@_date: 2017-07-27 04:11:22
man, are you lost? the 2x part is actually a no brainer and probably not dangerous if say like 95-100% of miners go for it. There'll will be no other chain to survive, bitcoin is roughly designed for it. Services and relay nodes will have to forcefully update their software anyways. This is how it's meant to be

~95% are signaling intent for NYA. But it's not guaranteed indeed. However, it has a good traction you have to admit. I run a full node and I'm willing to run segwit2x already. Let's see the outcome of it, there's 3 months to evaluate the HF part.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:08:03
No, the number is not important. I can myself setup 1 thousand nodes if I want
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:34:09
Ok, so let's find out, right?
Either ~75%+ hash power is gonna split then small-blocks will need a HF in days/weeks anyways (which will kill your argument about years planning a HF) or we're going to see big blockers following the current segwit proposal by pressure (I really wish this could happen).

Shame. They don't even allow 'fee ranges' like mycelium which doesn't allow custom fee. :/

Nope, btc-e is nothing, there are thousands of other exchanges, maybe a slight FUD drop followed by a recover

The thing is they will never do this because they know the price will go to 0. That's not the case we are facing today.

You get your US-af run by Putin then

The math is the same bro. Thus the loss is the same

Yes. The first part of S2x, which is segwit, is compatible with Core

Bitcoin is not for micropayments *yet*

You said it right, *guesses*. You can still spin up nodes way cheaper than pow bypassing the *very good guesses based on IPs and other factors*. That's the point of pow duh

Dont invest what you can't afford to lose. For. Every. Investment. But IMO, If you can truly hold for 1-2 year and you'll probably not lose money as you want to sell at the panic selling market right now.

Yes, it's segwit from core as it is today

how about you help improving the proposal so it can move faster instead of shitposting your 5% UASF fork?
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:22:10
Because BIP148 is dangerous and a failure? Because of its ~5% enforcing nodes? Why a contentious fork/split/whatever most people have been fighting against is now okay? Doesnt all this sound strange for you?
