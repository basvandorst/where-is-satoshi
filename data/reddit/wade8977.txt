woah...is autowikibot actually a real thing?

Ahh...interesting. I would consider myself an avid price-checker but have never noticed the difference in the spread. I will have to pay more attention to this in the future. Thanks for the explanation

Take my poll:
Is Huobi's trade volume real or fake?

I think the discrepancy is between the stated market depth and actual market depth. If Huobi is faking their volume than their market depth isnt really market depth at all...I believe the point of looking at the spread would be to determine whether Huobi follows similar pattens of other exchanges congruent with what one would expect out of Huobi if their volume is indeed as large as they claim, which would either confirm or refute their stated volume.

While I completely agree, what do you mean when you say that Huobi has less market depth than BTC China? From the picture doesn't it look like Huobi has a greater market depth to coincide with their larger trade "volume"? What am I missing here?

Because if 70% of the bitcoins traded are fake, that would have huge market implications on price

Cool! Thanks for this. Do they speak either english or google translator chinese? Have you contacted Huobi support before?

Just curious as to the sentiment in the bitcoin community

I'm a little upset that I wasted my time reading this...

Is there any way to collect emipirical data to figure out whether or not they are indeed faking their volume? I would seriously like to get to the bottom of this.
