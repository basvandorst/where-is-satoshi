Its the second one,the browser 'integration' for ln-pay is the same way how your torrent client integrates with magnet: URL or your Steam integrates with steam:// URL. So ln-pay starts up when a lightning: URL is clicked after ln-pay has been registered as lightning protocol handler in your favourite browser, and then it connects to an running lnd process through gRPC, and the user confirmation is done either through a terminal popping up and asking yes or no or by using Linux's [Desktop Notifications Standard](
In the future, I will probably make a proper Firefox addon that works kinda like Metamask but still talks to lnd, but I still don't understand Javascript and it probably introduces another possible attack vector

I actually don't expect my first python program released into the wild getting this much attention, especially with yalls.com author tweeting it :)  I've created this because I want to test LN without me copy pasting those invoices into lncli every time I want to pay something, and for some reason both zap and lightning-pay doesn't work on my laptop for some reason.
Unfortunately I cannot work on this right now, as I will have a maths final exam next week, but after that, I will make a proper reddit release thread after I've make the README much more understandable
