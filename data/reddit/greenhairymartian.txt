snitch? are you 12 years fucking old?

seems pretty standard manufacturing delays to me, while i don't think it's a scam, i think they're in over their heads, and don't have the skill or experience to understand that in manufacturing. shit goes wrong. you have to be real good to prevent these kind of issues.
i've seen this same thing play out in many, many different industries. someone with a good idea/concept thinks they can do it all.

@_date: 2012-06-21 04:25:07
ok, so i feel the need to explain, because i realize that friendster.com was 10 years ago, and in internet age, that's a millennia.
Friendster.com was the first 'social network' that really took off, they targeted it more as a dating site, but it was facebook before facebook was facebook, it was myspace before myspace was myspace. it was the original site that was mass adopted. it was popular, it had millions of people. but it suffered from a lack of scalability. when it got popular, it got sssslllloooooooooowwwww. it had server crashing, server not responding erros, it got so slow that people started to jump ship to this other website called 'myspace', which picked up where friendster.com left off and had the entire userbase of friendster.com jump ship, it had none of the scalability issues that friendster had. the rest, as they say, is history....

unless i'm mis-reading things, you charge a higher rate than bitinstant (4.8% vs 3.9%) for a cash deposit via moneygram, any advantage?

SR appears to be borked at the moment.
give yourself credit, you did what you should have, you looked at the blockchain to see what was up. the network confirmed the transaction, and you just need SR to update.
@_date: 2012-10-05 16:53:30
it is busy, but there isn't too much to do on there, just a few boxes to enter information, and they're nicely separated. I think the problem is that it's a bit of "WALL OF TEXT" like.
you can easily take out some of the redendant info and still get the information to the user.
examples:  
* "Use this section to configure your bitcoin wallet" &lt;- unnecessary as the title of that section is "wallet configuration", that kinda explains it all.  
* Under Twilio Setup: "Enter your twilio account details in the space below:" is also unnecessary.
work on streamlining the text and you'll get rid of the "busy" problem.

yes, safe. they offer a quality service. i'd highly recomend them as an easy entry into bitcoin.
if you're paranoid, use them to buy the bitcoin, and transfer it to your own wallet. (or mtgox, or an instawallet, or wherever else you want)
@_date: 2013-01-19 23:41:14
not a bad price for a 4runner.. although it depends on what work has been done to the engine, those 3.0 V6's were prone to head gasket problems.
@_date: 2013-07-30 04:11:48
yes, although you have to factor in risk, fees, and delay. the fees and delay in getting USD out of mtgox makes the selling price higher than on other exchanges.
@_date: 2013-07-30 04:10:54

as a merchant service, shouldn't you stay away from the speculation/astrology market?
i mean, I would say that the biggest thing that a merchant wants out of USD/bitcoin exchange is stability. making wild charts with triangles and lines makes you seem less legitimate. just saying.

i'd pay subscription to have a synced RES.
one of my biggest complains about my current reddit experience is i use 3/4 different devices, computers/phones/work/laptops/ipads, and i'm always scrolling past the links i've already upvoted/hidden/read, and anyway to make that easier would be a godsend.
res already makes things amazing, a synced res would be beyond words amazing.
