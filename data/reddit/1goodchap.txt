Bitstamp was founded in 2011. The price signal was there. There should have been more, especially in the US.
Deregulation would imply the regulators were paying attention and decided to dismantle previous regulation. What was going on was that they were not paying attention yet. I can see how this threat of future regulation and the uncertainty it caused combined with the regulations already in play at the time related to banking and money transfer could slow growth and let MtGox maintain its market share. I understand you cannot, and we will have to disagree on this issue.

If they did agree what new revenue they do get could lose purchasing power by loss of market share to cryptocoin  the one that didn't add more coins. Better yet after Bitcoin is forked we could see which fork maintains market share and generates the most value for its miners.

What surplus of exchanges are you talking about? Where are the exchanges for which I don't have to wire my fiat to random parts of the world? MtGox was in the process of losing market share to new exchanges. My argument is that this took longer than it should have. Why was it finally happening in 2013/2014? I think 2011 would have been a good time for this process to start. 
In my opinion some of the players with lots of money lost at MtGox were taking advantage of its price disconnection from the other exchanges and their privileged ability to circulate fiat after selling their BTC from other exchanges for a gain. I think a lot of these people knew that this was risky. As for the others, I think they wouldn't have been burned if there were true competition in this space.

The altcoin would gain in value at the expense of the Bitcoin miners.

Nice! I am looking forward to "Satoshi Nakamoto."

One could argue current regulation and uncertainty of future regulation caused MtGox to have more customers, or any customers, than it should have had by limiting potential competitors from entering the market.

I would just be happy that Bitcoin made it that far. If the world decides it wants some inflation and wants to give a greater reward to miners than necessary, so be it.
However, I think for Bitcoin to be the defacto global currency in 50 years mainstream economics would look somewhat different than it does today. The current mainstream looks at Bitcoin with doubt and incredulity. I think if it were a success the new mainstream would present some argument for why they think it became so.
