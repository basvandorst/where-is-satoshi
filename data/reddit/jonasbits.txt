I tried this with Bitcoin Testnet coins, works great. Locktime can be specified by blockheight or unix epoch timestamp.
I used this Python demo at
there is also
a nodeJS demo at

This is how it looks if you open a laminated wallet with heat  its not possible to scan the QR code, but i could read the private key.

So the scammer used a carefully created Phising email to get your "private key" to the escrow
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:27:40
Since 2008 sending email with hashcash or mbound stamps is possible with [Penny Post]( Thunderbird Add-on. Would be fun if scrypt and bitcoin (OP_RETURN) could be implemented!

Hope you get the payout soon! I have a long way to go with only one Block Erupter :-)

Any news? Is there some problem with converting this and sending him the money?

In fact every transaction already have a "Locktime" of zero, meaning no delay. In testnet you can schedule a transaction to be included after a certain time or above a certain block height, but in mainnet this is not yet possible. Instead you have to trust another party to broadcast the transaction when "Locktime" expires.
Also, this transaction can only include the coins available at the time of you signing it, so if you add coins at a late date you need to create a new transaction and change "Sequence" to be greater than the last transaction.

A very good article, thanks!

My payment via Bitpay timed out and the order didnt process at the webshop i was shopping at. This was due to me using a low fee and sending with to few confirmations.
I contacted the webshop and they could not do anything, I then contacted Bitpay with a signed message that I wanted my bitcoins refunded. This was over the weekend and my confidence of a smooth resolution was at 100%
It took time, but everything worked out in the end!

love it!

did the scammer really write his own code? in the link below they talk about Phising emails that was made to look like they came from the mentioned escrow service

I really like this read, in startrek there is a saying: IDIC, infinite diversity in infinite combinations. Maybe we should let the code do the talking, let the best code win. Code is stronger then the Pen, the Pen is stronger then the Sword.

compressed and not compressed public keys, the only difference is it takes up less space in the blockchain

Really good talk!

I think BitPay generates a unique address for every click on that button. And you can click the little refresh icon to make it generate another

I combined BIP38 with a generated 64 bit hex password from  and split it up in 7 parts, if they lose em, get 3 parts to reconstruct the hex password.
I gave one ordinary paper wallet sealed with holostickers, not yet done with the above safeguard :-)

I have to cut and paste a dot when specifying the amount, the keypad uses the swedish notation with a colon (,) but the app does not recognize that

There is a PERM_WRITE_PROTECT bit you can set on SD card with some custom hardware as this guy did

Here is a hack that could be modified to set the PERM_WRITE_PROTECT bit on a SD-card. Looks really interesting!

I like your idé to frame the paperwallet, but would use BIP38 if it was placed in plain view.
