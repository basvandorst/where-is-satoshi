"Do you understand how Bitcoin works, its pros and cons?"
If their answer is in the affirmative, then they already know not to buy Bitcoin.

MtGox only had the correct price when they were $100 higher than anyone else. Now they're showing less than the other exchanges so we're not using them anymore. Please switch to an exchange with a higher price, like [Bitstamp](
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:44:39


Literally nothing.


As has been said before, Bitcoin is the story of how libertarians learn the importance of regulation in the financial sector.
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:02:37
Don't throw your money away.
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:25:13
They're literally just offline backups.
@_date: 2014-02-12 03:01:04


@_date: 2014-02-11 23:43:10


Just money...
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:28:05
No. They will need to trade with their neighbours who will not accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:21:26
MtGox used to be popular around here, when their price was $100 higher than everywhere else. What happened?

Speculation, hoodwinking the gullible, etc.
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:45:43
Some libertarians learnt about regulation.
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:22:28
I'd say the numerous flaws in the protocol and lack of regulation are Bitcoin's biggest hurdle.
@_date: 2014-02-11 01:20:46


Your money is likely gone.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:57:47
tbh everyone who thinks bitcoins are dumb are probably trolls. They just aren't as smart as us!
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:30:50
Considering the recent crash was due to people jumping ship to dogecoin, I'm taking it pretty seriously. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:21:52
Last week I accidentally paid $20,000 for an item at an online store which actually cost $2,000. I called VISA and they reversed the transaction immediately for no cost.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:48:28
This is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:45:55
Is bitcoin better dogecoin?
@_date: 2013-12-14 10:25:26


Move to Somalia then.
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:55:25
I'd rather stay. The crash is going to be glorious.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:41:26
When people realise their bitcoins will be near-worthless in the very near future and everyone starts selling.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:42:27
Dogecoin is essentially taking over as bitcoin crashes, so dogecoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 06:11:53








Your greed has led you down this path. The best thing would be for you to learn from this experience.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:26:38
Email isn't backed by *math* though.
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:53:52
Pretty sure they require you to use an intermediary to convert your bitcoins to fiat first. They just recognise the gullibility of bitcoiners and are getting free advertising and sales from suckers.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:17:25


Not sure if serious...
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:12:03




Why can't I pay in bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:21:11


Actually not true. Bitcoin is hemorrhaging users to Dogecoin. The entrenched bitcoiners fear what they cannot control, so they fear it and seek to destroy it.
Don't worry, friend, dogecoin is only just getting started!
@_date: 2013-12-19 12:52:52




Truly bitcoin is the currency of the future!
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:32:01
Bitcoin has been slowly dropping all while people notice the power of Dogecoin.
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:01:58
People just don't believe hard enough. This is good news, guys!
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:23:42
If your family wanted bitcoins, they would have them already. Stop trying to force your ideology onto others.
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:06:57
What's the lowest you'll watch the price go before selling? Or are you going to ride it to the bottom?
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:59:19
You're wrong actually. Bitcoin is the currency of the future, and is far easier than traditional fiat so-called "money".
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:31:07


lol, they don't want bitcoin, they want USD.
They just know how to con gullible libertarians into shopping with them.
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:45:17
You are the reason people mock bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:48:07
Bitcoin users.
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:07:55
As long as you don't like having money, I've got a bridge you may be interested in...
@_date: 2013-12-21 06:28:31
If you read the interview you would know that they are planing on converting any and all bitcoins to USD immediately so they don't lose any money.
Make no mistake, they believe in marketing, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:05:35
Yep. Definitely going to go up again. It's just a cycle Bitcoin goes through. It's literally impossible for it to crash forever at this point.
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:25:14
This is *so adorable*! This community is a never-ending fount of amusement.
