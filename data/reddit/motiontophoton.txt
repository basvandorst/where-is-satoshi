From my research Trezors seem to be a good choice. Even if your pc is compromised and someone is using a key logger to record everything you enter, I understand that a Trezor is still safe to use even on that system. Its the same as having an offline cold wallet on a machine which is never connected to the net I believe. Bit pricey, but if you're trying to secure a decent number of coins, perhaps very good value. Not sure what others would advise.

You can recover the funds using other wallets and your recovery seed. From the coindesk trezor review..
"The next order of business is to write down a randomly generated 24-word seed. This seed will allow you to reconstruct your Trezor wallet in case you lose the device.
This is the only backup that can be used to recover your wallet in case of loss or theft. Trezor uses BIP39 and BIP44 standards for creating new wallets, so the generated seed can be recovered and used by other compatible wallets.
SatoshiLabs confirmed that users can use Mycelium 2.0, Wallet32 or Multibit HD to load Trezor's recovery seed to their computer."

Entirely depends on how much 5k represents to you. If next week, a fatal flaw is found in the protocol and the market crashes, will you be devastated, or will you be able to shrug it off. Bitcoin is not a sure thing. Repeat after me... "ONLY INVEST WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE."

I found this video to be hugely helpful in finally understanding exactly what private keys are, and how they work.

Store of value, speculation. If there was anywhere in the UK selling stuff I wanted, I'd be using it for commerce :) As an experiment and as a piece of technology its fascinating. If it goes to zero, I won't lose much, if it takes off, I'll be happy to have gotten in a little early.
