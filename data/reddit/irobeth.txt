**Transaction Malleability**
If a player would draw a card, instead you may look at the top two cards of his or her library. If you do, choose one of those two cards, then that player puts that card into their hand.

If BTC are worth millions, chances are there's state-sponsored exchanges or something. Just understand the kind of power you're giving away by exchanging something real and limited for something fiat.
Exchange to whatever currency is best used for investing and start making money make money through interest. Nobody can pay you interest on BTC (yet), so if you've got the material to live off interest then just use the interest to buy back into BTC once you have that engine working for you.

I imagine:
Mars cash is like bitcoins or something, just a medium of exchange. Wealth doesn't mean much on Mars initially, because the culture that makes it to Mars is a very unified under the effort required for the first Martians to "not die on Mars"
Initial trade with Earth would only be necessities because of the cost of sending stuff out of our gravity well, so I imagine Martians live a more minimal lifestyle than Terrans?

Could they still convert to eachother, then? You have the same latency problem there if you do, right?
There's gotta be a mars-earth exchange point somewhere, I imagine; what can it look like that allows 'trust-free' cooperation between the two planets' blockchains?

If I coudl have had a dollar for every penny I didn't pick up, I'd jump off a building too

I think if someone mines your post history for an ad-hominem to attack your current comment, you're safe to ignore them

If I could have a dollar for every penny I've never picked up, I'd be physically ill too.

Release a ransomware and use the wallets as cover to launder stolen coins from elsewhere?

...In which I reflect on posts like "this is the last time it'll be below 2000" from not even 4 months ago

the idea being they control the ransom wallets here, and are intending to launder stolen coins from a previous breech - whoever they stole the coins from may be watching those wallets waiting to see who gets them, but if the ransomware causes lots to deposit into those wallets, they may tumble them all out at the end of the campaign and they'd be harder to trace

When something is discretely countable, the appropriate determiner  is "fewer"; when something is continuous or impossible to count, the appropriate determiner is "less"
When you use "less than a mile", it is because "a mile" is treated as a discrete unit and thus any quantity "less than a mile" is either zero miles or some real quantity between 0 and 1 which falls into the continuous qualifier

I'm wondering what happens to all the BTC they seized in the raid, do those just disappear?
Does that mean that there's 21M-~26000 BTC left in the pool now? Wouldn't that alone raise the overall value of the remaining BTC?

$2 a day is $730 a year with no growth. BTC started at like $12 USD this year, has crept to at a minimum $54 USD in Q1.
It's not a cash grab, it's a long-term investment.

He said value, not money.
Someone made money, but BTC lost value

i.e. It's possible that the 26k + undisclosed wallets(?) are being held as a time-bomb to crash an exchange with a huge sell order?
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:32:27
There's only going to be 21M BTC, how feasible is it (for a well-funded agency) to try and buy up all the mined bitcoins to "lock them away" ?
