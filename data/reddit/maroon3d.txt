If you have wads of cash hidden under your mattress... not really. 
However if you start making large purchases with cash, you might catch someone’s attention. 
Definitely will raise some red flags if you go to the bank to deposit a large sum of cash.

How easy was it to buy the Bitcoin? I imagine a transaction worth two years of salary is large and could (would?) raise a red flag.

Look into various light wallets available that don't require you to download the entire block chain. Electrum is probably the most popular/supported one that I can recommend.

Actually it's worse. She also pumps "vaginal cleanses" or some bs like that which causes real damage.

With the 1BTC example, what if you only sell .1 at a time? How exactly do you match up the original purchase of 1 for $1 with say 10 sales at various price points.
Because I understand the general concept of capital gains, not so much how it applies when you can't physically separate which fractions are sold/bought.

I know this is an old post chain but I have a question...
Say hard fork happens and I personally have control of my coins, what does splitting my coins actually do and how would I do it?

Figure this would be a good place to ask..
Have my Bitcoin Core client running and up to date. At the top it says "Warning: Unknown block versions are being mined! It's possible unknown rules are in effect".
I imagine these are the BIP91 blocks. Do I need to do anything or just sit back and relax?

The official Bitcoin Core client is probably the best way to do it without having to worry about 3rd parties.
While the fact it has to download the entire blockchain is a slight issue, coming straight from the Core developers is the best bet.

So wait for instructions, got it. 
But is it safe to say if I currently have 1 BTC, and a split is offered, I'd then get 1 of each of the two coins?
