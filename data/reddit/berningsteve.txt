So bitcoin is a religion?

Later it will be time to sell at a loss
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:01:44
entirely plausible scenario. a test of $6500 does seem to be in order,
however, it is also possible that it first takes a side-trip back up to 8000.

If Bitcoin were to replace the $dollar, 
does that mean that the price of Bitcoin would equal infinity dollars or zero dollars?

Wouldn't it be the other way around? If Italy ditches the Euro it will soar because it won't be held back by Italy anymore.  Because the Euro is pretty much Germany and France anyway...

If you had bought bitcoin 1 year ago, you would be up more than 10%
@_date: 2018-10-11 10:18:28
hasn't bitcoin dropped about the same as the DJIA in the last 24 hours?
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:02:47
because its not a safer asset?
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:02:11
shocked I tell you...shocked

Its not about price, its about adoption.  IF high price stands in the way of adoption, then the price should go down for everyone's best interest.
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:30:48
its trying to, but people keep buying the dips anyway
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:48:24
The floor is the limit.
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:29:23
8000 is still possible, but I'm starting to have my doubts...

a healthy return on your investment?
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:22:27
Bitcoin is not Gold, but its worth noting that when Gold hit $800 in 1981 it took nearly 30 years to hit that number again.  Two Generations had to go by before the price set a new high, which, dollar adjusted, was still well below $800.

Bear markets end when the last true believer quits.  Give it a few years.
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:26:59
Short HODL
$1200 or so.

Year over year comparisons are not good.
New investors are probably not born yet.
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:24:34
Bear market. Retest the low of $6000. If it holds it may go back up. If it fails, then it will go a lot lower.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:21:20
Remember when bitcoin was as high as $9000.00?
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:25:28
Not how it works.
The people who bought at 15k aren't going to sell until it gets close to 15k again.
When they do, it pushes the price down.
This will happen for a generation to come.
Gold hit $800 in 1980, and it didn't get back for 20+ years.  By the time it did, the dollar was worth 1/4 of what is was the first time.
So yeah, save yourself the loss from time and inflation, and get out now.

Them is dick eating words, pardner.

Dollar Cost Averaging is BULLSHIT created by stock account managers.
A better plan is Buy Low, Sell High.
And don't fall in love with your investment.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:25:59
Because the people who bought it at high prices are waiting for it to go back up so they can dump it.
There is a huge amount of overpriced bitcoin out there that will take a generation to sell off.
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:24:22
Is that what you read? I clearly said it was going DOWN to at least $6000. It may stop there, the bear market will be over, and a new Bull market will begin. OR, it will not stop there and definitely go lower. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:17:43
More like $250
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:48:08
More like $300.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:27:29
It makes me feel better to know that a lot of other people share the same delusion that I have.
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:06:06
No. I mean $9000&lt;br&gt;
It was 45 minutes ago.&lt;br&gt;
 
It may never be that high again.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:43:45
Those who held were not rewarded for their patience.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:41:43
A qualified NO.
That said, bitcoin IS in a BEAR Market, 
which is less like a crash 
and more like having 
your teeth slowly ground down with an electric file.
