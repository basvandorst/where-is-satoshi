You know what’s surprised me? The overwhelming popularity of Lamborghini’s vs anyone else in these crypto chats and forums. I figured Ferrari or anyone else would be just as popular. Some exchanges (like Binance) have even done Lambo giveaways/competitions. 
Edit: who downvoted me over an observation? ��

The 17 shots fired to the back of the head indicate this was clearly suicide.

For me, I would do the 49” ultra wide Samsung at the bottom and do a 60” 4K at the top with DisplayFusion. Very similar real estate with a much cleaner setup.

You’re gonna make a killing on those earplugs. Customers will love that sweet relief when the cashier can’t shut up his rambling about crypto when they ask what the funny bitcoin box is.

Yeah... that’d become a tattoo on the bottom of my foot or something if it was $1B+

I’m ready to see the same level of aggression displayed with the development of Dubai. This could get interesting for sure.

Oh I’m sure some have been on it for YEARS. These are just the sites I “frequented” every few months.

Guys, keep googling it! The price is going down making for easier buy opportunities! ��

Yeah, it’s been this way for a few years now. I’m a silver stacker, so I noticed immediately. Started popping up the first time BTC got past $4k

Has there been an “official” monetary transaction done in space yet? If not, maybe we need to push for cryptocurrency to be the first ��
