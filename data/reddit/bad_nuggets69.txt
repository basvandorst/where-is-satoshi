I see your point, but that’s irrelevant since those costs are applied against the block fee on the miner side.

My coworker got in today for the first time before the sell off.  I keep sending him graphs asking if he is scared yet haha.

Classic middle finger pattern.  This pump is going to 24k at the minimum.

That’s how they do it in non-U.S.A countries.  It’s confusing a fuck.  India had a comma (or period) every 2 places

He tried to shill his J I M coin.  It’s only 0.02 bro, great time to get in.

This video is going to turn VEN into a pump and dump, place your sell orders now.

They are costs to the miner.  But miner costs are irrelevant to the topic.  The price of the block (block prize including any fees) is the cost to bitcoin of operating.  The market dictates that that cost is equal to the miners cost plus profit margin.
In a real world example.  You buy a stamp to mail a letter for 25 cents.  The cost to mail your letter is 25 cents.  It is irrelevant how the post office sends your letter (ground or air) and how much those methods cost.  You, the end user, have a cost of 25 cents.

I hated that game so damn much.

I dont have my life savings invested so I’ll be fine.  I believe in the underlying tech, so I don’t think it’s that great of a risk. But your right about the arrogance part.  It’s ez to look down on people when your standing on the fucking moon.

Girl did that to me to, but I ruined everything cuz she has me on tape saying “you can’t rape the willing”.  I feel like my life is ruined now.  I can’t even go public with this information - I’ll be a laughing stock

This is actually legit advice lmao.

Semantics.  But for sake of argument, different example.  You go to McDonalds and order a hamburger for 5 bucks.  The cost of the burger factors in the cost of the workers in the McDonalds, the farmers pay, and the cost to feed the cattle.  It all wraps up into that 5 dollar cost.  That is the cost of a burger from McDonalds.  It costs $5.
If you count the cost of paying the farmers, in this example, you are double counting your costs and overstating how expensive it is.
That’s the rules of accounting.

I’m thinking we hit 24k then have a minor correction.  Up to 30-70k and then the next major drop.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:46:43
Bought GBTC - simpler for idiots like me that are only comfortable with second level control of bitcoin.  Don’t understand wallets or trust any sources of wallets, but understand block chain.
Got once I saw the correction hit floor.  GBTC trades at a premium over the underlying bitcoin, I bought in at a higher premium than I would have liked, but I’m riding it up to ~22k bitcoin price, where I expect the next correction.

These guys don’t realize weed shops use bitcoin since they can’t hold money in the bank...

As far as speculating is concerned that volatility is good for making money

You earn a return on foreign currency exchange.  The idea is if your return is based on how the person you give the money uses it - that’s a security.
