Let's first hear your definition of bits. There are many of them flying around. Metric prefixes are nicely defined and everybody agrees with those definitions.
@_date: 2014-11-17 08:35:51
This can be true but it still looks childish because it defaults to dogeesque "Bits". I can imagine that with most people not familiar with Bitcoin the reaction goes like this:
What is ChangeTip? What are Bits? Neverheard. Don't care. 
What is ChangeTip? Oh, Bitcoins! I've heard of this one. Let's go see.
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:03:38
As a slang term. Let's ask banks to start referring USD as bucks or smackeroos. Can't you see why bits is a bad idea?
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:16:41
That was not my point. My point was using something like Bits seems to promote incorrect use of metric prefixes. I don't approve that Americans would rather make up arbitrary units instead of using the international standards. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:15:43
I would say that satoshi has an arbitrary value. The technology is called Bitcoin anyway.
@_date: 2014-11-18 16:31:51
I have a feeling that there is not a lot research done on Bitcoin. This fact might limit your choice of topic more than anything. This is why i stated that you might be asking the wrong questions. 
It was just an opinion, I don't have facts to back it up.
@_date: 2014-11-19 12:41:55
Americans have a history with avoiding metric prefixes by inventing new meanings for existing words. Most hilarious example is calories vs Calories. 
calorie = cal = 4.1868 J  
Calorie = kcal = 4186.8 J
aka "full retard"
@_date: 2014-11-16 15:49:47
This applies to the Bits proposition as well. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 14:46:08
No confusion? No confusion. Really? Except you just confused calorie and Calorie. Let's just see how confusing it is when merchants give their prices in milliBTC, no wait kilobits, kiloBTC, microbits?
@_date: 2014-05-09 21:39:37
Just stop calling them bits. Or at least define 1 Bitcoin == 1 bit. Assigning 1 bit an arbitrary Bitcoin value is stupid.
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:11:37
You end up using metric prefixes anyway. Why change the base unit then? Being a developer doesn't make Gavin's opinion any more valuable than anyone others.
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:28:55
Hence theoretically. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 21:40:43
How about educating these people instead of conforming to the lowest common denominator?
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:54:30
It is crazy to invent an arbitrary name to mircobitcoins or "ubits" among friends.
@_date: 2014-11-14 10:09:24
You wold rather invent a new meaning for an existing word and use the same old familiar prefixes than learn couple of new ones?
@_date: 2014-11-13 19:55:16
This is true. Prefixes are there for bringing the numbers to convenient values to handle and type out by hand. Using powers of ten accomplishes the same thing. Humans don't do well with long strings of zeros. 
Making up new meanings for existing words instead using universally accepted prefixes is just dumb.

When Dogecoin seized to be cool all the new cryptocurrency puppies moved to Bitcoin. Now we have bits... Great.
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:30:52
This is exactly the reason bits is a bad idea. The bits some people are fuzzing about are simply microBTC, uBTC. Now you can ask anybody "What does micro prefix mean?" on just google micro prefix or u prefix.
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:12:19
This is where you go wrong. Metric prefixes are an internationally accepted standard. There is no problem switching between them. The switch happens naturally when people find it more convenient to switch to uBTC because thousandths of mBTC are too cumbersome to handle.
@_date: 2014-05-09 07:45:50
You turn your back for few months and these american idiots try to fuck things up. 
"Nobody uses metric for currencies" ahem... 1 centidollar == 1  cent == 0.01 dollars
"Metric is confusing." 
"I don't want to learn new things." 
"I'd rather make up new meanings to already overloaded word." 
What is wrong with people?

Only if the world agreed how to display numbers. Where i live they teach us to put that 1 700 000 bits and 1,7 BTC. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 09:49:57
So you just don't want to learn anything new? I am very sorry but the world does not work that way. 
mBTC =/= MBTC, there is a difference.
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:07:02
@_date: 2014-10-22 21:19:56
This is why people use prefixes.
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:42:31
Bit is an arbitrary name for uBTC. Bit is an especially bad name because it is widely used in other contexts.  Why not just use uBTC and treat it in your head as a different word? Now there is no confusion because there are no multiple names for the same currency. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 10:18:32
Has it never meant 1 millionth of a bitcoin? You are just digging a deeper ditch for your argument. A word that has already many meanings some of which are closely related to the subject(technology and money) is worse than some totally unrelated word meaning of which cannot be misinterpreted.
@_date: 2014-11-19 16:08:14
I stand corrected. Same meaning none the less.
@_date: 2014-10-22 07:26:03
How about most of them?
@_date: 2014-11-13 12:36:50
It sucks that there is this loud minority promoting the idea of bits. I see nothing but harm coming from this. 
These people refuse to see the flexibility of metric prefixes. Today 1 mBTC is at the same order of magnitude than 1 USD(or Euro or GBP or whatever) in value so it can be said to be the designation of choice. In the future the value equivalency will go from mBTC to uBTC and beyond. Having to invent new units to every new factor of ten that seems convenient at the time is ludicrous. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 10:09:43
This won't be necessary if we stay with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:15:39
desidollar == Dime
centidollar == Cent
millidollar == Mill
Edit: Maybe you should start using lars instead of dollars. 10 000 lars == 1 dollar, because reasons.

At least this one does not have Bits on it's name.
@_date: 2014-05-09 07:26:46

I know. I was making fun of this bits nonsense. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 17:06:43
What on earth are you talking about? 1 Kilobitcoin = 1000 bitcoins. 1 millibitcoin(mBTC) = 10^-3 bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-05-14 11:10:06
Wait what? uBits? microBits? 1 Bit = 100 Satoshis. Satoshi is smallest possible transaction. uBit = 10^-6 Bits = 10^-4 Satoshis = 1 picoBTC. Too small for the blockchain. Why does the changetip-bot allow smaller-than-satoshi tips?
@_date: 2014-11-19 15:42:31
What do you think where that "cent" comes from? How about metric prefix centi, meaning 1/100?
@_date: 2014-11-13 13:06:04
Good job that you censored those decimals. Those horrible terrifying decimals! You better display those in bits because decimals are bad for you. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 21:15:18

So people would rather own hundreds of thousands of something than 0.1 of something? Why? 
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:25:49
It doesn't? 1,700 and 1 700 can be equal or be different by a factor of 1000 depending on interpretation. I would say it matters.
@_date: 2014-11-19 16:02:57
Slang is fine. Just don't default to it in everything. Nobody should be first exposed to bits before Bitcoin. ChangeTip and now Coinbase using them as default unit is simply harmful.
@_date: 2014-05-23 06:15:11
I wholly agree. Best thing is that i got tipped couple of uBits the other day and I was very confused because the tip seemed to be too small for blockchain. But apparently uBit == Bit... Rly? There is an expression for this and it has something to do with palms and faces and collisions.
@_date: 2014-05-14 12:57:42
I actually did know that. Just trying to make a point about Bits being stupid.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:50:13
You are changing the argument. uBTC is fine. Anything Bitcoin is fine as long as it makes sense. Bits are not fine because it is not Bitcoin. It creates confusion among new users.
Dealing with fractions is equally as annoying than dealing with thousands and tens of thousands. Why not learn to use mBTC while we wait for the price to rise and merit using uBTC. 
Opinions are like assholes. Everyone's got one and they all stink. Did Gavin give a good argument for bits or was it just a off-hand comment?
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:10:13
Nice nice argumentation mate.
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:39:10
And thanks to the flexibility of the system the "best" prefix for everyday life for the current value of Bitcoin can and will change over time. No need to invent new designations they are already there.
@_date: 2014-01-11 23:00:19
Yeah... It would make sense for the client to hash through the blockchain on import. Guess there is no risk. But anyway. Instead of putting their efforts into torrenting people should just run a full node.
@_date: 2014-10-22 07:29:48
So let's change the name every few years as the price goes up exponentially. Great idea.
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:49:18
And being "just right" is not a weak argument? Or "Why not to" is not a weak argument? 
Most pro-bits arguments are solely based on ignorance. Bitcoin is the smart, let's not conform to the lowest common denominator.
@_date: 2014-11-13 13:56:03
Theoretically you can go through the Blockchain and find a wallet with this exact amount of Bitcoins in it. If there is only one such wallet you have a name associated to the address.
@_date: 2014-10-22 21:30:46
They are not worse, they are descriptive. This is good because people are now aware of Bitcoins or bits in this context. The prefixes are established and universally understood. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 09:12:20
Sounds about right.

Just playing devils advocate here and pointing out that paypal offering a way to get ones money back in some cases is not bad. This is an useful feature. Surely it has it's downsides as we see from OPs case but let's not pretend paypal would be any better as a whole without this feature.
@_date: 2014-01-11 22:23:34
You skip validating the blockchain. Your client just accepts the blockchain you torrented as valid. I haven't thought this through but if someone was to maliciously modify the torrent and enough people used the modified version, something bad could happen. Maybe... I would not do this.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:01:05
Yeah! You can exchange Bitcoin to euros and vice versa in Finland without paying 24% extra for the government in taxes each time you do! Who would have thought.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:22:07
Word Bitcoin makes it clear that it's about Bitcoin. So yes, I think that substituting word bit with microBitcoin or uBTC will make a difference. 
Even if word microbit is used and it is somehow implied that Bitcoin is in question you should not have to know that Bit means one millionth of a Bitcoin. "Bit" should be nickname for Bitcoin at best.
@_date: 2014-11-13 16:52:29
Let's see.
The prefixes in question can be easily converted by dividing or multiplying by thousand. This is not hard. Now all you have to learn is that micro is smaller than milli.  Not hard. 
Confusions with prefixes are certainly possible but having to deal with millions of bits does not reduce the error rate in any way. 
For example paying 1700000 bits vs 1.7 BTC for a television or paying 8800 bits vs 9 mBTC for a coffee. I would argue that dealing with all these zeros results people using metric prefixes no matter what.
I have no problem with replacing Greek letters with appropriate Latin letters. Technical correctness is not the main point behind metric prefixes, universal acceptance is. America just hasn't caught up yet and it is about time that those guys caught up with the rest of the world.  
@_date: 2014-11-19 15:44:42
There is no reason at all that we can't use the metric system with Bitcoin as the base unit.
There are reasons not to invent new "base units" and lead to confusing kilobits, megabits, microbitcoins and millibitcoins.

No, and there is a reason for it: bit is short for binary digit. This is not a good argument for bits to be used as a replacement for uBTC.
@_date: 2014-06-01 08:04:20
No. It's not. How about something people outside of your jerk circle understands? Like 5.392 mBTC for millibitcoins? 
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:50:33
Yes they are using Bitcoin the currency. Why wouldn't they be? They may not be contributing to the network but they are using Bitcoin. It is totally unfeasible to have a full bitcoin client on your phone for example. Untrue blanket statements without explanation are stupid and get downvoted. Simple.
@_date: 2015-07-09 21:10:40
So that was your point. What does off-chain transactions have to do with rising the block limit? Coinbase is a bank that happens to deal in bitcoins. Why would you use carrier pidgin to carry money to/from your bank vault, off-chain makes sense and is significantly faster in Coinbases case. Is there something wrong with that?

The blocks are not processed in parallel. There is only one blockchain. A block is added to it every 10 minutes and a limited amount of transaction data is included in that block. The miners are competing to find that block to get the reward. 
Finding the block is exponentially more expensive than signing the transactions to the newly found block.

The limit is hard coded into the Bitcoin protocol. It will not change. 
Nodes cannot fuck things up, unless majority of the computing power decides to fuck things up in the same way in the same time. Even then fucking up is limited to double spends etc. not fundamental changes to the protocol. 
However you are welcome to fork bitcoin and make your own currency with it's own network with higher limit.
