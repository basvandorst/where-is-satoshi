Yes if you are sending a few $K worth of BTC somewhere, there is essentially no difference between 4 cents and 8 cents and even 100 cent fee.
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:35:06
True in many cases for sure.

Maybe he's speculating, not investing.
And yes there was a time when $430 was a fortune for me, but thanks to BTC (and other crypto), not so much now.

They aren't going to legalize it.  Too many women like to use sex as a weapon and they don't want men to be able to go out and get an incredible f*ck session for $60.  
And also a lot of insecure women who aren't good in bed do not want the competition there either.

I don't know if that's what he was talking about. But if you want to play that game, could probably find some dorky currency somewhere and go back 100 years and it has performed well.  Although of course fiat usually loses purchasing power.  Anyway, Bitcoin is a roller coaster and I wouldn't brag about it increasing in value right now after being so far off its highs a couple of years ago.

"The People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Monday continued guiding its currency lower, setting the yuan/dollar official midpoint at its weakest since July 2011. Beijing's introduction of a yuan rate index against a basket of peers - seen as a move that traders said would depeg the renminbi from the greenback over time - further weighed on the yuan."
I don't know if this is that big of a deal, but must be at least a small positive for Bitcoin.

I think you can sell whatever you want, legal or otherwise, although from what I understand, you can't use Tor so not sure if you can sell anonymously.  Although seems like you could connect through a VPN.   It should be interesting to see how it all turns out, in practice.
@_date: 2015-12-04 23:14:46
I've got to think that's the case.  And I suppose you would't want to load these with too much BTC because could still be pressured (at gunpoint, etc) to give up the funds, just like with an ATM card.  
Anyway sounds interesting and I like how there is still more development in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Yeah not tough to be best performing currency in the world when you lose 80% of your value right before that.
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:32:33
That is another strategy but I think he was talking about selling the top of a parabolic rise and then buying even more BTC at a lower rate.  That is obviously a very smart and good thing to do if you are interested in having more BTC and not having your current BTC be worth less.

Coinbase sucks.  They were pretty much thieves in late 2013 and early 2014.  I have no idea if they improved at all, but I would never give them another chance.  They would take money out of your bank acct..hold it for 5 days for bitcoin you purchased.  And then if the price of BTC had gone up, they would cancel your order literally 10 minutes before they were supposed to deliver it.  Total scam..total thieves.
And then to add insult to injury, they would pull extra funds out of bank acct and cause overdraft.   I always go out of my way to steer people away from them.

I lost $5000 worth of BTC to Blockchain.info last year ago due to a similar issue.  And blockchain.info customer support responded and said tough luck.
I have never used the site since, for obvious reasons.  I've moved to Mycelium and cold storage instead.
$5000 was a huge blow to me, but I survived.  I can't imagine 64 BTC getting lost that way.  And I kept that much in my blockchain.info wallets back then at the time....very scary.

Bitcoin is inflationary, not deflationary, right now.  And that isn't going to change in July either.  It will change in many, many years but doesn't help anyone at the moment.
And anyway BTC is so incredible volatile that I doubt anyone is holding it right now, because they think it is going to increase in value due to deflation.

What BS:
"Across the country, law enforcement is cracking down on sex trafficking of minors by going after online escort ads."
What % of prostitutes out there are minors being sex trafficked?   Like .001%??
No they are cracking down on it for political reasons because dumbf*cks will vote for someone who is against  prostitution.  Dumb, insecure unattractive women especially hate prostitutes more than anyone else.  But a lot of men hate them as well, which is always difficult to understand.
But anyway yes this is great for Bitcoin and also great for these women who are just trying to make an honest living, providing a very valuable (although illegal) service.

Yes why do you need bitcoin in Greece if you have Euros.  They aren't going to lose all their value overnight.  Of course if you want to leave the country with a bunch of Euros and they say that is illegal, then bitcoin could be better but I doubt is necessary for 99% of Greek citizens.

The "reasonable price' is usually free but I would gladly pay a few pennies or more if it's worth it to me.

Yes and genetics is the main reason...not the only reason but the one that accounts for well over 50% of why that is the case.
It's not some bullsh*t that young girls should be encouraged to like math in school or anything like that.  It's because they don't like math and they don't like bitcoin.  It doesn't interest them. And nothing wrong with that.

You still need the private key and BIP38 decryption phrase somewhere.  And anywhere it is, it can be stolen.  
But yes if you kept that decryption phrase broken up and hidden in many different places, might be better. If you just keep it in your head, it is lost if you die or get mentally incapacitated.  Actually you still have to write it down somewhere or the instructions down somewhere..no way around it.   You could use secret sharing though and make that more secure.

Blockchain.info customer support sent me the latest backup but it didn't have the private key for that address.   That was the problem..it was never saved/synced in the acct for some reason even though was showing that it was part of wallet and had BTC balance.

I was online.  And I did have them send me a backup later, but that address wasn't in there so the private key wasn't saved.  I don't totally understand how the site works, but I think this is pretty much what they told me.  You can export the private key from your wallet and yes, I definitely recommend being sure you have that in hand for every public key before you send funds to it.  I learned that the hard way but hopefully saved someone else from losing BTC from this same situation.

And yes I basically see what you are saying, but you can't "test" a paper wallet without making it a hot wallet first.    At least I don't know how to do so.

@_date: 2014-12-06 22:07:39
Yes exactly...just not reassuring to send BTC to your blockchain.info wallet and have it display the balance and confirm those BTC are in your wallet...then you find out they aren't.  It should confirm the address is valid with valid private key before it displays them in your wallet.

I'm not new to bitcoin.  I have used bitcoin for several months.  And big deal if I think sometimes that bitcoin may have difficulty succeeding long-term...it's because of reasons like the one brought up in this thread that make me feel this way.  Other times I am optimistic about it.  I would love to see it thrive but still feel that gov'ts may crush it.  You don't see it doing very well in Russia do you?  That's because you would enjoy up in jail if you used it there.
But I love bitcoin for the most part even after losing 15BTC this way and 11 BTC in Gox and a couple of other ways too.  It's very discouraging though and I know I'm not the only one who suffers these losses.  Using paper wallets may help now but still some risks.
And actually not new to reddit either but I try to create a new reddit acct periodically for privacy purposes. I was too lazy about that for months but recently finally did it.  I really should make a new one every couple of months.  
And btw, I never said bitcoin users are "bag holders"  That is straw man argument and shows where you are coming from...to make things up.  I use bitcoin a lot myself and still have signinficant holdings. I was saying in the trading reddit that it's not smart to just hold and watch your btc value decrease and decrease..better to cut your loss and buy back even more when it's lower.

@_date: 2014-12-06 20:11:06
Nope the site itself is glitchy and doesn't work right.  I lost about 15 BTC because the site didn't "sync" up properly with my wallet.  It didn't bother to save the private key for one of the addresses in that wallet.  So I sent BTC to that address and showed as there in blockchain.info.  
Then I log out and back in and the address is gone and the BTC are gone and their customer service says "tough luck".
Now I keep most all my BTC in cold storage and spend from there.

Thanks...I survived the financial hit and am mostly over it.  But it's things like this that can turn people off to bitcoin for life, esp new adopters.  That's why Gox debacle just decimated bitcoin user adoption growth.  
And I'm certainly not putting blockchain.info in that same category as Gox by any stretch, but their site is just too buggy and dangerous to use when things like this happen. 
But yes you are right the way to go is to be in possession of private keys.  However ,then a challenge to figure out where to store them and encrypt them and a keylogger could still trip you up, etc.  And if you print them out, then could be stolen or lost, etc.  Right now I generate them with offline computer and save screengrab of them into jpg file and then I encrypt that with PGP.  So fairly safe unless someone gets my PGP pw...which is complex and only exists in my head, but I type it into my online PC every day.
And btw, this type of thing is what makes me doubt bitcoin catching on more and succeeding.  This happened after I had been heavily into bitcoin for several months.  I wasn't a noob by any means. And I'm also much more computer literate than most people.  If I can lose my btc like this, then got to think it can happen to many other people....either this way or similar.  Oh well...hopefully better software and sites will be developed to prevent such disaster from occurring.  I'm smarting from this one but need to put it behind me and soldier on.

Yes I agree with all of that, and that's finally what I learned the hard way after this lesson.  
Of course I still have some BTC on exchanges to trade with, but that can't be avoided.  But with everything else, I have the private key in hand.  
So the main thing I trust right now is bitaddress.org (running on computer never online to generate the key pairs).  If bitaddress.org is somehow a scam or corrupt, then I could be screwed, but hopefully that is not the case and seems unlikely from what I've read.

Exactly.  After you buy a bitcoin, the price you paid for it means absolutely nothing, except maybe for tax recordkeeping purposes.  What matters is how much the bitcoin is worth at the moment and what you think the market price will be in the future.

Some of them were suckers..they bought at 1000 and sold to you at 400.   But some of them are smart and bought at 405 and cut their loss quickly at 400 and will buy back at 200 or so.  Time will tell whether you are a sucker or not.
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:35:23
lol...don't ask that.

Yes maybe good for bitcoin price that these were taken out of circulation but wasn't going for that kind of charity in this case.  I wonder how many other BTC has suffered similar fates and what the real # of accessible BTC is out there.  I have a feeling a whole lot of them have been lost.
@_date: 2014-12-08 01:41:14
Yes very true and I have wanted to do this SO many times.  I do not want to give Warner Brothers or Sony $10 but will happily give that to the artist and would love a way to do this.
And If Warner and Sony weren't evil, huge, multinational conglomerates, then would consider giving them their cut, if fair.  But they have so much power that their cut is $9.50 and the artist's cut is .50 (maybe).
So F them and hope this catches on.
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:54:41
No one is saying that bitcoin has been a bad investment if you bought 1 year ago and held the entire time.  Of course you would have been a poor investor to hold down from $1100 to $400 but there are a lot of them out there.

Don't you know that buy and hold is the only sound investment strategy??  To buy at 800 and hold until 400 is smart.   Why would you sell at 750 and buy back twice as many BTC at 375?  That would make no sense.  Buy and hold is the only way to go.

There's been many times when their deposits and/or withdrawals have not worked and they have always fixed it within hours..within 24 hrs max.  I doubt they are Goxing anyone.
It's a peculiar site how they never add any new altcoins. I don't think they've added any in a couple of years.  They don't seem to really need the site to be extra profitable and just content with it rolling along as it does.  Perhaps it's a way for them to liquidate their BTC from other operations or who knows.
I don't have any $ on BTC-e right now but I usually do...anyway no reason to be alarmed.
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:29:22

Gov't can kill Bitcoin anytime it wants. And no not kill the protocal but kill and crush the price and imprison anyone who is caught using it.

No their economy won't be hurt much at all.  And you must be kidding that banning bitcoin would cause their "social structure to dissolve".  
Anyway it's going to happen before long anyway so be prepared. All it takes is a false flag terrorist attack where BTC was heavily used and it's over.
@_date: 2016-06-22 16:35:55
Yes I never forget that.  And a lot of evil people who got there by being evil.
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:43:03
There are many ways to crush the price...too obvious to list.
And millions of people around the world aren't using bitcoin.  But the ones who are, they imprison them by apprehending and then holding a trial (optional) and then placing the person in a prison and making it so they cannot escape and then they are "imprisoned".
@_date: 2015-08-17 17:37:18
They have so many laws that we are all guilty of something.  If everyone is guilty, then they can arbitrarily decide who to lock up at will.  Check out that book, "Three Felonies a Day".
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:03:36
It seems a bit extreme, but should make a point if it succeeds.  And if BTC is truly this susceptible to this kind of attack, then better to find out now and with some warning, rather than being blindsided by it.
@_date: 2015-08-30 01:30:12
Of course they do.  What better way to discourage new merchants from signing on than by making it clear that they risk gov't (and IRS scrutiny) if they decide to accept bitcoin.
It's just another small battle that the Power Elite is waging against bitcoin....a war that they are winning handily, btw.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:59:34
Yes it's tanking the price more now..big dump on finex and down to 261.  I shorted a bunch to hedge in my long position in cold storage.

Yes it is money, there's not "money in it".   And you can easily google a chart to see if it is going up or down at the moment.

Ouch, another reason to sell/short BTC right now.
@_date: 2015-08-26 04:46:12
Acquire them from coinbase and send them to a regular wallet address and then to another one and then to LBC. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:27:03
Ok if you acknowledge the real risk and feel the benefits outweigh those, then I cannot disagree with that.  But yes probably too risky for me right now.
@_date: 2015-08-12 15:50:45
So you use that and still go to jail if you get caught...wouldn't change that much.
Bitcoin will just be like illegal drugs at that point...not exactly a great situation.
@_date: 2015-08-12 18:29:20
Yes of course they want to "destroy Bitcoin innovation".  That is the entire point.   And a very easy sell to the dumb masses as just say that BTC is for drug trafficking and sex trafficking and terrorism, and kiddie porn..  Those four will scare any person with low IQ and they will go along with it.  And they don't care because they don't use BTC anyway.

If bitcoin ecosystem can be killed that easily, then obviously best we know about it asap so a fix can be in.  At least they are announcing their intentions in advance.
@_date: 2015-08-22 15:33:59
Yes use bitaddress.org to generate paper wallet.  If you want to be extra safe, do this on a computer not connected to the internet and even better is one that has never been connected to the internet.  You can download bitaddress.org htm from the site and run it on the new computer.  That is probably overkill but that's what some people do.
But that will generate the paper wallet and you can either print it out (on paper) or just save it and encrypt a screen shot of it. (or save as PDF, etc).   But to fund the wallet, you just send BTC to the public key of the wallet.  Then you can check that public key online to make sure the BTC is there.
Then to spend or move the funds on the paper wallet, you use the private key.  You can enter it in different sites and wallets, etc.  Use Mycelium or Bitcoin core or many other wallets to access the funds.
This sounds simple to me, but just because I've done it.  It took me months to really understand paper wallets when I got into bitcoin. I just had a block there in my mind but they really are easy.
@_date: 2015-08-29 04:40:19
Yes there are other coins that have better privacy..DASH is an example and I'm sure there are others.   But bitcoin seems to be anonymous enough that it is still the most widely used.

And  btw, I store all my bitcoins in paper wallets, except the ones in exchanges that I use for daytrading.  So I think they are about the best way to store your BTC and more secure than most wallets that could have software problems or get hacked.  I lost 25 BTC on blockchain.info site because their wallet screwed up.  So be careful.

Yes I wasn't disagreeing with the title or OP.  I was commenting on the post I replied to.

Most to all great investors don't watch their investment slowly drop in value by 80% without selling and taking a small loss rather than a catastrophic one.

Yes the XT fork drama/FUD is just a MAJOR change in the short term fundamentals of bitcion and the BTC market.  I wouldn't think we were going below 200, but I can see this taking us lower for awhile.  
And traders/investors are losing patience/confidence with BTC as store of value that appreciates over time or at least stays steady.  We are significantly lower than we were in April 2013...just not good.
I still love Bitcoin and BTC as a trading vehicle.  And it will be about as useful in many ways if it is $50 per coin, vs  $250.  But I've sold all of my long-term holdings and mainly trade it now.
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:44:25
You must not have lost anything in Gox.  This is a day for celebration, even though it is hollow victory of course.  but I thought this was on cnn.com so was worthwhile to post it and others like me won't get tired of seeing multiple headlines that Karpeles is going to jail (at least for awhile and probably for quite some time.).
@_date: 2015-08-30 03:33:05
Yes exactly.  It's the seller's problem if he isn't licensed correctly, not yours.  Just look on LBC and maybe there are some sellers left...or go to a bitcoin meetup in NYC and see if you can find some.  
And yes good point and if you buy from somewhere else, if you tell them you are from NY state, then they couldn't legally sell to you.  It's unlikely they will ask that question, but if they do, you'll have to figure out how you want to respond to it.

I doubt it will go to 10,000 in an instant.  Those who bought at 700 should have sold at 650...then buy back when it hits 700 again if you want...at least you lose 8% there instead of 70% or whatever it is at now.
@_date: 2015-08-19 16:57:06
Yes I did this recently...used Gamestop gift card to buy Shell, BP, Dominos and Amazon gift cards at Gamestop.   They have some others too...pretty decent selection actually.
But there was a deal on ebay where you got $60 of Gamestop giftcards for $50.  And a deal at Kroger where you got $50 ebay gift card for $40.  So basically got Gamestop gift card for 33% off and any gift card you bought at Gamestop for the same discount.  So 33% off gas, which was even better.  
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:38:24
I doubt would be possible to prove it to you, and wasn't saying it was one trader.  A whole lot of people sold/shorted the XT news and for a good reason apparently.

Coinbase.. I mean CONbase is terrible and you are better off without them.  They cheat and steal from their customers all the time.  If bitcoin goes up since you placed your order, don't count on them giving it to you, even though they took the money from your checking account 5 days earlier.

@_date: 2015-08-26 04:47:08
That is the whole point.  The whole point of bitcoin regulation and related laws are to leave you SOL.  If you can't buy bitcoin, then you can't support it and help the price go up, etc.  It's a concerted effort to kill BTC and it's working.

I didn't read the article, but it's certainly why the price dropped (and is still dropping) right after the XT fork news was announced.

It is not designed to kill Bitcoin innovation...it is designed to kill bitcoin itself...or further chip away at it.

Sorry if it doesn't make sense to you but apparently it does happen.

Perfect time to buy more BTC was sub $200.  I bought some at 178 and 180, but sold a bit early at 226...still a nice trade.
Anyway I wish I could have bought more down there, but just couldn't make it happen.  But $230 is not a bad entry point either, considering we were at $255 a day ago....prices tend to be sticky, so I'm betting we get back to $240 at least if not a bit higher.

@_date: 2015-08-19 15:34:12
Well you could say the drop to 160 was a "panic" to some degree, although was more a function of stops being hit and margins being called.  
But those who "panic" sold at 210 and bought back at 180 are smiling pretty wide right now.
However some people just aren't traders...they just aren't cut out for it.  So sad to say, but just holding BTC is probably the best idea for them.  However, no way you can say buying something at 1000 and holding it down to 200 is "smart".

It is not a "larger issue".  It is THE issue that we are talking about here. And your statement "If the card was stolen or fraudulent, Amazon wont process the order of course." is wrong (of course) because they do process some of these orders.

You may be able to use cash to buy Amazon gift cards and use those to trade for bitcoin online.. on localbitcoins.com or elsewhere.  
I used to trade Amazon cards for BTC at about the market price, so I know it can be done but more difficult now that gyft.com is more popular.

Same way banks giving out fake money..operating a fractional reserve.
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:22:07
If "Coinwallet" can bring BTC to its knees so easily, then we have a very, very serious problem.  I've never even heard of them and this not like a big bank or gov't attacking bitcoin...it's some piddly company.  
Anyway I'm surprised the price is holding up as well as it is.  I am not going long BTC again until this XT fork thing is resolved and also after this Coinwallet attack is done.  I just don't see much upside at the moment.

"Our government" is only made up of people who work in the gov't.  Some of them are evil f*cks and some of them are nice, honest, smart people.   But yes I get your point and don't disagree.
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:31:39
Yes no way you can say that BTC has been a good asset to hold for investment purposes over the last 24 months or so.
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:18:02
Bitcoin doesn't collect any info from the user either, so more of the same doesn't make Shapeshift more than "pretty safe" which you could say the same about BTC.

@_date: 2015-08-15 19:54:15
I know what you meant and there have been many occasions where someone deposits cash into an account and then they get their bitcoin and then they go back to the bank and said they made a mistake (or claim there was fraud) and they get their cash back.  
I don't know if you would lose the cash that was deposited into your account, but good chance your bank account would get shut down and you would be banned from banking with that Bank forever.
There is also the "man in the middle" scam that I learned about by reading on LBC too.  In that case, the person depositing the cash would indeed be a victim of fraud, but not by you...by the person you sent the bitcoin to.   
Yes it is slightly complicated, but just saying OP better educate himself on this before he takes your advice that cash deposit is totally safe way to sell BTC.

Yes I agree. The 9% inflation is rough, and if you think about all the BTC that has been lost, and Satoshi's locked up coins, etc then the rate of inflation is probably even higher.
But the fact that all these new coins are being mined every day definitely puts downwards pressure on the price.  I know it is unavoidable but just a fact.
@_date: 2015-08-22 03:30:10

I've got to think that most hookers aren't going to be able comprehend the basics of bitcoin. Many of these women have pimps because they are unable to do hardly anything in their lives.  And I am pro-hooker and have been with 100+ of them, but that's why I"m saying most are not capable of properly securing their BTC or anything else.  
Of course there are some very bright ones but they are in the minority.  But I bet you get a lot of industrious pimps getting into BTC and this is a good thing.

They screwed over too many of their customers in the past and maybe it caught up with them. Terrible word of mouth is not very helpful.

You could do it with LBC...wouldn't take that long to buy $75K worth.  To sell it for cash might take longer, but if you don't need it all back in cash immediately, then could work and just sell a few $K at a time...and for 10% over going market rate.  
And you could probably buy the $75K for market price or below.

No....this would have already happened if it was going to happen.

@_date: 2015-07-10 23:50:42

@_date: 2015-07-27 14:39:41
Hey...but...."thanks for the cheap coin".
Anyway yes of course bitcoin usage is failing to grow in the past year or so and is actually contracting.   
The internet didn't have a Mt Gox to give it terrible publicity that could never recover from. 
Plus there weren't myriad gov't regulations to discourage/ban people from using the internet.
I could go on but no reason to.

Yes I would say buy bitcoin with some of it and maybe bury some of it somewhere where no one else is going to find it.  
And yes I'm sure the IRS would want a healthy cut of it if you tell them you found it.  And of course considering this is a public forum, I would have to encourage you to give them a few thousand dollars because that is the legal and right thing to do.

Speaking for myself, there weren't "huge red flags" of them being totally insolvent.  Very few people were speculating about that at the time and saying that and no one thought they lost 600,000 bitcoin or whatever it was.  Hindsight is 20/20.
But I was also a bit careless about leaving too many funds on there as well.. I lost maybe 5% of my net worth at the time, thanks to Karpeles and Gox.
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:46:47

And doesn't even make any sense because the adult ads at BP are free right now so people would just be using BTC to pay for ads selling a car or similar. 
And sex workers are doing something illegal, but can't get mad a beautiful young blonde who will make me feel incredible for .34 BTC.  It's a slam dunk and so simple.

I have to respectfully disagree here.  It is good to "advertise" OpenBazaar here and every time there is a post, it makes another person aware that it even exists.  And it needs users (buyers and sellers) to be successful, so the more people who are aware of it at launch are the better.
But thanks for letting us know about subreddit and I will check it out.  I'm definitely one of those unhappy ebay users and will post some items on OB as soon as it is up and operational. Thanks for your hard work on it.
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:39:17
Coinbase are crooks and that's why I haven't used them for well over a year.  They would withdraw money from my bank for bitcoin to be delivered a week later and then if the BTC price went up, they would say that they were canceling the order and would do this one hour before it was to be put in my account.  And this has happened to many people....just google it and avoid them if you are smart.
@_date: 2015-08-12 15:40:50
Way to follow along...if LBC doesn't sell BTC itself, why would it need to register with FinCEN??

@_date: 2015-07-04 15:41:37
Yes exactly...we are going to need slow steady price appreciation like this for people to give BTC a chance..it needs to stay above $200 and it could take years but slowly more people will get into it.
@_date: 2015-07-10 22:51:01

I spend from paper wallets/cold storage all the time with Mycelium and have never lost any BTC due to some "change address" issue.  That is simply incorrect. And I have never swept all of it to another address.  I recommend doing this, in general, but I haven't bothered and haven't lost a thing.

They are afraid of us, like we are afraid of an ant that we step on when it wanders into our house.

Yes.   normal processing of transactions is being delayed, so not "normal' any more.    
You may be able to get around it with higher fee added to your transaction but a lot of people don't know this and still points to fundamental weakness in the BTC network and protocal if so easy to "attack" it like this.

I don't trust anything that has to do with Bitcoin Builder because the guy who runs it is very dishonest.
He first said that the site would stay up indefinitely and you could trade BTC for Goxcoins.  Then he suddenly shuts it down with something like 20 hrs notice.  Not two weeks, not 7 days..not 48 hours.  He goes from "forever" to 20 hours..boom...and no more trading a way to get your goxcoins out by trading for btc as before.
And now he holds your BTC hostage unless you give him all your private AML/KYC info.  He didn't require it before and never said you would have to provide it to get your money out.  He's essentially stealing funds this way..not cool.
@_date: 2015-09-14 17:23:12
what a small sad sore loser you are.
@_date: 2015-09-10 19:56:14
I know they didn't go ahead with the regular attack, but they are releasing those private keys and still leading to bogging down the network.
How bad do you think it will get and I wonder if this will kill the rally? I may sell my BTC and buy back after a drop...or short some, but not sure. The price is strong lately and not sure if this will push it off the cliff or not.
@_date: 2015-09-15 21:08:53
This is bad news...anytime the banks collude to do something within their oligopoly, it's going to be very, very bad for everyone else in the world but them.

Why do you think a "smart" federal judge would want to clarify what bitcoin actually is?  It wouldn't be very smart for his career to do so.   Of course they want to have it vague so they can persecute people for as many bitcoin related crimes as possible.  They are trying to smother bitcoin in its crib and they will probably succeed.
@_date: 2015-09-21 15:36:08
Yes very true. Whenever a bitcoiner gets arrested for using bitcoin, many people here say "Well he broke the law so he deserves the punishment".  They miss the entire point.

No he doesn't have to abide by them.  Poloniex is based in the USA and they don't hold your funds hostage until you give them personal information.
He just has a history of deception and dishonesty, so use Bitcoin Builder at your own risk.
@_date: 2015-09-10 14:44:10
They've been fighting for some time and they are winning.  Part of the reason the price is this low is because of their efforts.  IRS regs, regulations in different countries and US states...they are tightening the screws and they will continue to do so.
And no they won't "kill bitcoin" but you can celebrate when many people are in jail for using it and the price is about $20 per BTC.  "Bitcoin lives and cannot be killed!"  Congratulations.

up to near 10,000 now.  I think I will short some BTC.

How do you sell for speculation?   Sorry but there is a limit you can sell per day as an individual.  There is no legal limit how much you can buy, but if you bring more than a few hundred dollars, I'm sure they could seize the cash for civil forfeiture before you even do any bitcoin trade.  
They can take lots of cash from you in the car or if you are walking down the street or just bust in your house and take it.  They have the power to do that and the law behind them.   That's sort of why bitcoin is so great because they can't seize what they can't get to (or don't know about ).
@_date: 2015-09-16 22:41:31
Gox is still not coming back and he reopened it a few months ago.

No one could forsee China cracking down on BTC.   Bitcoin was hitting new highs at $1100 and the Chinese are what made it crash...or start to.
And i'm sure you were talking about those "silly amateur investors" who bought at $600 at the time too...even though some sold at $1100 a week or two later.
@_date: 2015-09-03 18:55:23

So why can't they own both?   Oligoplies and monopolies are the American way.  
@_date: 2015-09-18 16:27:14
That's not really a practical way to trade BTC.  To buy and sell through LBC with all the commissions and spreads and not be able to get in or out until you have a trade partner.  Makes more sense to send your BTC to Bitstamp or Bitfinex and do it that way.
@_date: 2015-09-18 22:32:46
My point was that people don't "sell for speculation" they buy and sell on a BTC exchange do that.

Bitcoin is not a gov't currency or a drug or a firearm.  Regulating bitcoin is just regulating any other invention that doesn't harm people in anyway.  But yes the monied Power Elite see bitcoin as a threat so they use their goons in the gov't to regulate it and persecute bitcoiners..just the way it is.
@_date: 2015-09-09 16:52:28

It is really racing up now.  That stress test (attack) is just mounting. I'm nervous about holding too much BTC and just sold some of mine.  This thing hurt the price last month and supposedly an even bigger attack this time around.
I wonder if now is the time to buy some LTC too, as it is seen as an alternative, without this problem?    I'm not sure but the BTC price is holding up pretty well at the moment...should be interesting.
@_date: 2015-09-11 01:28:15
Too bad that part of what is "advertised" is being susceptible to a 51% attack.
@_date: 2015-04-15 05:12:28
Reality check is that regardless of the future of bitcoin and the price, everyone who bought in the last 2+ years bought at the wrong time.
@_date: 2015-09-10 20:08:20
Coinwallet planned a direct attack on the system, but they were getting too much heat for it, so they went with an alternate strategy of releasing the private keys for 200 BTC but in thousands of addresses.  So many people are trying to spend those funds in the private keys and at the same time and it's causing backlog in the network....very bad and could take a long time to clear out.
@_date: 2015-09-21 15:40:19
The marijuana plant evolved to withstand attack too, but that's not helping the thousands of people rotting in prison for using it.

@_date: 2015-09-11 01:40:48
Wrong...it was a classic speculative bubble and little to do with Karpeles and his magical willy bots.
The price increased because people thought they could double or triple their money...buying, and selling before the greater fool did.  And many of them succeeded and are retired now.
@_date: 2015-09-04 18:49:02
They should have already sold these but they are waiting for bitcoin price to rally first so they can take knock it back down.  This has been their strategy every time and the only reason they don't announce these auctions months in advance.  It's all part of their anti-bitcoin strategy which they are executing very well, on multiple fronts.

@_date: 2015-09-10 20:20:49
Or maybe you don't understand how the bitcoin network works... a delay is a delay.  No one said anything about transactions being "stuck".   
But the numbers don't lie and there is an attack on the network and it is causing delays in transactions going through.  Unless you think blockchain.info is falsifying their data, and not going to argue with you about that one.

No it's terrible news for Bitcoin because they will just crack down on bitcoin more if they are concerned more about capital flight.  They already caused the price to crash from 1100 to 600 or whatever it was.  So now we will thank them from taking us to 220 to 140 or whatever it will end up being.

It was due to China 20x more than Gox.  Gox just happened to be concurrent and helped it along a little.  There is no Gox now and you can see what the price can do.
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:40:55
Yeah maybe.  I am scared to jump back in and hold overnight at these levels, but you could also double your money in a week (or shorter).  With the $1100 bubble, there were some decent pullbacks along the way but no real crash until China released bad news.

Yes drugs are illegal and people are thrown in prison to rot for a lifetime for using drugs or selling them.  That is actually a good analogy.
Yes you will still have a few people trading bitcoins on the black market at that point, but it will effectively be dead as anything signficant or anything that can grow.

Time to add to my short on this news and the spike on nothing.
@_date: 2015-11-16 04:21:10
Yes, that is the plan.  The question is how much of a % will you get back.  I think around 20% is the consensus guess, but of course could be much lower than that.
But still anyone who paid 4% for their Gox BTC will probably come out way ahead.  I bought a bunch at that rate but dumped a lot when I found out Gox was insolvent.  Bu not all of it so should be a decent little windfall if 20% is the rate.
@_date: 2015-11-02 17:07:51

Watch the price tank before the halving.  The market often does the direct opposite of what is expected.

First of all it is Backpage.com, not "Backpages".  You want to have that straight or you are going to sound clueless from the start.  But check out the site and browse some escorts and body rubs so you have an idea what you are talking about.
As far as advice to give them, first recommend a good phone wallet...Mycelium is great for Android.  Don't try to explain cold storage to them because most sex workers are not rocket scientists....a few are but 99% of them are not.
And yes Paxful is a great site.  It is tailored around the Backpage sex workers with a lot of great customer support and easy to use interface.  So would definitely recommend it to them.  
Coinbase is bad and evil for a lot of reasons.  Localbitcoins is not safe for attractive young women.  Paxful is best.

China did ban it being used as a currency and it was a major blow to the price.  We were at $1100 beforehand and now at $400.  And if China banned all the exchanges there, we would be back down to $200...or $100.
And they can do it...any time they want.

Every run up with have the majority losing money because so many stubbornly hold even when the price tanks later.  Well I don't know if it is the majority but it is a lot of them and this won't be any different than the 2013/2014 time frame.  
Sure it's possible that BTC won't see the the $200s again, but it's likely that it will at some point in the next few years.  We dropped into the $100s three times after being over $1100.  That says it all.

And if you are having fun with it, then just see the losses as entertainment expenses.  And we could be back to $520 in a week or sooner, at this rate.

This is just the beginning and watch stricter regulations placed on bitcoin all over the world as a result of this.  They are always looking for excuses to limit/shutdown bitcoin as much as possible and nothing scares the dumbfuck sheep type person more than "TERRORISM!!!!"  .

Price is not irrevelant to anyone who owns bitcoin and cares about how much their asset is worth as part of their net worth.
But yes agreed that we were at $300 recently and then down to $190 and now back up to $280...doesn't seem like anything new...been fluctuating all year in $200 - $300 range and no indications that will change.  This rally especially seems like a pump and not based on any positive news.

Yes if you told people in late 2013 that we would only be at this point in late 2015, they would have laughed and said you were crazy.  Bitcoin has really failed to take off...I still like it but it's future growth prospects are not very good at this point.

Why do you not want to buy from people via localbitcoin?    You can meet them in person and then there are some where you just deposit cash into their bank acct and they send you bitcoin.

This is most likely some coordinated whale pump..it is too organized and predictable and so similar to past pumps (followed by a dump afterwards, of course).  But there is certainly a lot of FOMO buying as well and smart traders riding it upwards.  It's possible that China is genuinely getting back into bitcoin in a bigger way but just not believing it is the most likely scenario.  More likely some whale group just decided to use this as an excuse for their pump and to obfuscate the reality behind it.
Anyway I should be playing it better but doing a poor job. I try to short these spikes too early and end up losing..just a mental flaw but I'm sure most of you guys are doing great and good for you.  But it next leg up will probably come soon and bet we will hit 2000 on huobi or at least very close to it.

Not to be a dick, but yes if you uninstall your wallet software and don't have it backed up, then yes there is a good chance you will lose your BTC in it. 
But I have lost about 25 BTC before when blockchain.info screwed up, so I feel your pain.  I wasn't even able to make a backup in that case, but I did use it in the past when I could have so I did about the same as you.
So very expensive lesson and this is yet another reason why bitcoin won't grow much with the masses because 1001 different ways to lose your BTC.

Yes of course it is doing better than bitcoin retail payments.  I never suggested that it wasn't.  Apple is the most valuable company in the world and has something like $120 billion in cash.  They can advertise and promote their payment system and cause adoption, even if it it didn't work well.
But the point of posting that was to alert people that Apple Pay is far from a runaway success.

ok well sure if you buy bitcoin in 2011, then you are going to have enough for a big house.  If you bought Apple at $10, you would be able to as well.

Yes of course...and they shut down the exchanges and BTC price goes down down down just like at the start of 2014.

You are entitled to your own quirky definition of rich but 99.99% people say that $5 - $10 million of net worth qualifies.
@_date: 2015-10-30 23:29:08
I read and replied to exactly what you wrote.  It is above for all to see.

Better hope modern science finds a way to extend human lifespans so we all live to be 200.

Holding is the only rational strategy for small minded losers. But people smarter than you clean up and make millions with trading.   I know you can't accept that because you would rather everyone else be a loser too, but sadly it is not the case.

Yes and daytrading BTC is pretty fun too and sometimes more profitable, so whatever floats your boat.   Daytrading often feels like a videogame.
@_date: 2015-10-29 22:55:22
ok perhaps you are right because could turn into crazy bull flag after this.
@_date: 2015-11-15 19:29:33
Yes and people made a lot of money trading gox btc.  At the end, you could buy 25 Gox BTC for 1 regular BTC and we'll see how that turns out in a few months when they distribute what was left.

Yes "feel" is the correct term...not "think".  The same way that people "feel" that angels are real.

Yes some fucked up shit is happening with the blockchain lately...very troubling and I'm surprised (pleasantly) that BTC is still going up with this happening.
@_date: 2015-10-13 20:48:36
That's my thought but it's also free entertainment I guess.
@_date: 2015-10-31 20:03:44
Why hold if you can sell now and buy back 20% more BTC after the drop?   You end up with more BTC in th end.
And a drop isn't certain but just seems more likely now with the Ponzi closed.  We'll have to keep a close eye on China volume and see.
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:27:02
It wouldn't explain why Gemini volume is still relatively low, compared to the other exchanges.  There's no evidence of a lot of new money coming into the market through that exchange.
And Coinbase is regulated and in the USA and so many people said that would cause the price to surge at the time and it didn't.  China volume is fueling this rally and a mystery why.

Just use a VPN and don't worry about legalities if you aren't going to get caught.
@_date: 2015-11-02 19:04:46
more distributed than what?
And still doesn't change the truth about what I said and of course applies to many markets, not just BTC.
@_date: 2015-10-31 20:39:54
That is something different and sounds like a theory and not essentially a press release like this one is.
@_date: 2015-10-08 06:13:48
Yes had a a problem today...both myself and the person sending to was using Mycellium and both were having issues.
@_date: 2015-11-03 00:14:18
12 month price targets are enough of a joke with stocks but 100% absurd with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-28 07:46:29
You forgot "manipulation" by a coordianted group of deep pocketed individuals.
@_date: 2015-10-30 14:09:39
Well you still lose money on your early purchases and you are up on your buys below $300. It's interesting how people do mental acrobatics to "average down" and all that. It really isn't logical.
@_date: 2015-10-23 13:46:12
I agree that selling them on localbitcoins or similar is the way to go.   
@_date: 2015-10-26 05:37:41
If an "expert" says bitcoin is not the solution, then no way it could be.
@_date: 2015-10-10 01:31:13
That's a good point.  If i had $500K, I would pretty much retire or close to it.  Or just stop working hard and try to stay at that level without making more, most likely.
@_date: 2016-05-28 03:25:58
Yes I agree and the arrogance of blind holders is the shortest path to losing your money in many cases.
But I get that you must believe that anyone who trades well is imaginary gambling. If it helps you sleep at night, then go for it.
