Assumptions of motives on your end to move the field goal doesn't make me wrong.
But good on you for trying.
You are 100% wrong in your original claim.

So no...... 
it isn't designed to be fundamentally resist a hostile takeover at all.
That's all you had to say.

You need to go research what you can do with a 51% attack. I'm not going to waste my time arguing with someone who is ignorant and using assumptions to defend tangents you create.
I will check back at lunch and see if you actually looked it up or just moved the field goal some more.

Did they fix the 51% attack possibility? If not it is still fundamentally able to taken over.

Literally explained it. Read above.

It also loses more in a day than those companies do in a year. You pick your poison here. Both can be good both can be horrible.

A brand new account pretending he knows about taxes and claiming to be the top 10% wealth wise of Americans on a BTC subreddit!? How preposterous!! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:24:03
A 2 day old account interjecting context into my comments!
Then pretending to be an adult and dismissing me as a kid!
Dang man good try did you forget you were logged into that Alt account when attempting to defend yourself?
