Alrighty, here we go:
[My transaction out is here]( of 0.948 BTC. I'm not going to tell you how many repetitions. Can you easily tell me where it goes? Can you tell me where it goes at all?

[Well done sir](

Is that too cheap? What instantly let you know 'fake'?
@_date: 2013-07-30 14:04:52
Wow. I did not know that. So, more research on what it's supposed to look like next time. Do you have the link about the miner burning through a table?

At the end of my post, I say thank you for reading, and this gentleman was just informing me that I was welcome
