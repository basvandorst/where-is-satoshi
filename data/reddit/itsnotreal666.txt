Yeah, shady business is really common with cash, and most certainly never happens in corporate, banking, or government.
I mean, the government could never do anything shady or evil.

I hope you bought something nice in return for your taxes you paid.
What did you get in return? A road?
Or a war, more surveillance, more laws, less freedom, more bureaucracy, and government regulations invading your life and spying on you and your children? =p

Do you seriously think that your government will torture its own citizens over the passwords to their finances?
Hahahahah, you fucking sheep. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:58:55
Yeah, I'm sure the lawmakers won't illegally do anything.
Foolish citizen. They make the laws, not you.
That's why they rule over you, and you don't even know how bad it is.

What do you mean "you vote"?
Who is voting on this 1984 bill? I'm not.
You're not. I didn't elect any of these humans to rule over me and demand access to my personal finances. 
How dare they try to see how much money I have, and inevitably try to steal it.
You know why lottery ticket winners keep it a secret, or even move away, or change their name? Because once someone knows how much money someone else has, they'll get greedy.
That's why they not only spy on your finances, but they literally steal it from you, and call it taxes, and brainwashed morons like you think you "voted" for it.

Ahahah, you fucking moron.
You think the government just became "evil" last week or something?
Imagine this: Ape society. Biggest, baddest ape says "Gimme all da apples or ya get the stick."
Tah-dah. Government.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:44:44
And you call them your government?
Where the hell is your pitchfork and torch?
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:42:54
Well, what's stopping you?
Too hard to trust your community, eh?
Everyone around you is brainwashed into some religious cult or political party, right? Or a social movement even? Some shit that doesn't deal with the real problem.
Of course, you're probably brainwashed too, so you can fuck right off.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:51:38
You're a weak minded coward then, and I have no respect for you. 
You're a disgrace to your own humanity.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:05:21
That's right. 
The reality is that the NSA is already recording all that you do, and you already have to reveal your personal financial information to your government, so that they can steal however much they think is fair from you.
