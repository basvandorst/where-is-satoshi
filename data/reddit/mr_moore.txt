I mine ETH (Ethereum) with 1 AMD R9 290x and 1 AMD R9 295 x2. Power consumption is about 0,8 KWH and so electricity costs about 20 cents per hour (in my country). My hash is about 80 Mh stable. The last 3 months i mined between 15 and 16 Ethereum per month which I exchanged for about 0,3 BTC. I probably make some money when selling the hardware in about 6 months. 
Is it worth the effort money wise? No, probably not. But its fun and you learn a lot from it.
Money wise a better advice would be to just buy BTC with money you can afford to lose. Then hold onto it for as long as you can without any emotion involved (stay away from panic buying and selling).

Google “Kali Linux”. Boot a machine in “forensic” mode. Connect your old hdd using a usb docking station to the Kali Linux machine. Use Guymager to image HDD and save image as “yourfilename.E01”. Now you have a forensic copy of your hdd. Use software like FTK imager to mount the E01 file and extract the wallet files. Good luck!

Read the Bitcoin whitepaper...
@_date: 2018-05-29 08:15:57
We are still in a parabolic price movement. We had a few before and compared to this all looks normal. Bottom will be 80%-90% from last ATH, so around $2000-$3500. Thats when I’ll start buying again.
@_date: 2018-05-23 09:17:17
No its not. After the previous parabolic price runs, btc price retracted between 80%-90% from its ath. In this situation this means you should start buying at around $2500-$3500. You can still buy the dips while doing so as btc price will always be volatile...  PS: your username says enough.
@_date: 2018-05-23 05:11:16
That ati 4250 GPU has a killer reputation for mining Bitcoin. You should be able to mine 0,000000000000000000006 BTC a year when you turn it on 12 hours a day!

Nah, its the same pattern while we go down. It goes in waves...
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:56:39
You make the assumption that btc will go that high again. Do not say things based on nothing. Following your advice a lot of people will buy back in high.

Ffs... this is the third parabolic price movement in Bitcoin history. Looking at the previous two parabolic patterns and current trend lines, do you really think it is wise to advice people to buy more dips? Be real dude... Wait for this bear market to wear out and then start buying your way back up!

2500-3500 is the ultimate bottom... wont hit it this drop though, but within the year we will.
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:06:30
You must be new here... 
@_date: 2018-05-28 08:57:54
Its all human psychology... We are still in a parabolic price pattern. We had a couple before looking at BTC historical price patterns. Following these historical patterns BTC price will retract 80%-90% from its last ATH. Conclusion: start buying again when BTC price comes in the $2000-$3500 range.
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:35:07
It actually is quite predictable... start buying again when BTC hits prices between $2500-3500...

Start buying in again when we hit between $2500-$3500.
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:06:32
Yes, it’ll probably hit between $2500-$3500 based on previous parabolic BTC price movements. Oh and I wouldn’t call it a crash though. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:26:13
I’ll start buying at that bottom too. Previous parabolic BTC price movements show a 80%-90% retraction from that moments ATH. In this case that means we should bottom out between $2500-$3500.
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:26:10

It’ll go down even lower within a year. Probably bottoming between $2500 - $ 3500.

Hi Nice! Buy a write blocker before connecting the HDD!
Download and boot a Kali Linux USB or DVD and choose "Forensics mode". This prevents the OS to mount the HDD. Then use "Guymager" to make a forensics image to an external drive. Choose "E01" as file extension. This makes it possible to work on a forensic copy of the drive instead of working on the drive itself. You can later "carve" unallocated disk space for a wallet.dat file in case it was deleted. You can use "Photorec" for this from the "TestDisk" suite. Links to software: 
Don't start screwing with the disk without having a plan!
If you need more help with this, PM me.

Thats why my cold storage is so cold, it'll cost me hours to get my coins out. An avarage panic attack lasts for about 22 minutes. So when I have have a panic attack and want to sell, it takes so much time to access my coins, the panic attack layed down allready and I didn't do something stupid :)

This isn't the first price run in Bitcoin... i've witnessed 2 before. Exact same pattern. My guess it will jump even higher in the next months, say to 9.000 or even 10.000. So have fun but be wise. You're gonna need time to recover when it goes down. Because when it goes down, its gonna go down fast! So fast you don't even know wtf just happened. If you don't have time to hodl long long term because you need the money, don't jump in!

You had the option of 2FA and enabling a master password to lock your account yourselves. By locking your account it is impossible to add new wallet addresses to do withdrawals. To unlock it again you would need the master password or wait days. Sorry but if you put such big amounts of money at an exchange not thinking about security at all, you're asking for it. Now stop blaming Kraken for loosing it.

Such a bad title for this post... The poison being posted in both subs is getting worse and worse :( Its a classic example of this: 
Bitcoin was never meant to divide people. It was designed to unite people! It was designed as an alternative to this poisened and monstrueus other system that makes people slaves.
Seeing whats going on lately makes me think I was really naive thinking Bitcoin would stay free of human politics and the war tactics coming along. 
On the other hand I still truly believe this huge technological experiment will survive all the human poisoning and get better out of it.

It depends on how you look at things. From a users perspective this graph doesn't solve anything at all. It as well can stick at 94% percent for months, even years, meaning this won't benefit Bitcoin users at all. 
To be clear. I'm not supporting any "camp". I don't care about Segwit, bigger blocks or other solutions being introduced. Thats because I don't have enough deep knowledge about these solutions to judge. 
I just want to bring focus and attention back to the most important part of Bitcoin; its users. Because if Bitcoin doesn't progress soon, we'll be losing lots of them.

You can not compare Bitcoin adoption with an App or site going viral (Pokémon Go or Facebook). 
People are conditioned to use the fiat money system. Bitcoin is a fundamental change and it takes a lot of time for people to get their heads around it.
Comparing 2013 with 2016 I think Bitcoin has evolved a lot in multiple ways. All on a tech level though. Better exchanges, better apps (wallets), better Bitcoin source code, etc. Still much work has to be done. Bitcoin is not ready for mass adoption yet.
With all the monetary craziness going on in the world I think the adoption rate will accelerate quickly though.

1 of 2. Offline storage mode: Paper wallet with BIP38 password. Laminate it. Store it. 
2 of 2. Online storage mode: Create VeraCrypt image with sha-swordfish encryption using a very strong password and a keyfile. Store paperwallets PDF's in it. Store the VeraCrypt file in a 2FA enabled cloud service (Google Drive). 
Oh... and use a good password manager like Keepass2 with a strong password and a keyfile. You wouldn't want to loose those passwords ;-)

You must be new so welcome to the club! Psychology, so interesting. Why are people always jumping in when the price rises (including me in the past)? They never ever think about jumping in when it goes down (hard). Its fascinating, really.
From my experience I can tell you my Bitcoin bought at the time it al went down are more profitable than the Bitcoin bought at the Gox peak :-/
If you truly believe in Bitcoin (like me), it doesnt matter when you buy. Just hodl tight and you'll be fine eventually. Oh, and make sure its not too easy to access your coins to prevent panic selling.

Depends on your definition of "a while". I made 80% profit in about a year. Seems like a nice percentage for a year. But remember, there is NO guarantee for future profits. Bitcoin can be very nasty if you panic buy / sell too easy. Oh and it still can drop to zero!

The volatility in Bitcoin is a math problem. The volatility in fiat currencies is a human problem. As soon as Bitcoins (bits) will be posessed by billions of people price will be extremely stable. It will be almost impossible to manipulate it on a large scale, like it happens now occasionally. That is because people can't mess with its supply of max 21.000.000 Bitcoin.
Fiat currencies on the other hand... it seems to me you need to catch up on reality. Didn't you noticed what happened in the UK, Venuzuela, India, China, Brasil and Euro zone this year? 
O and by the way. The European Central Bank has been creating 80,000,000,000 euros each month out of thin air for the last year. It has been the biggest financial experiment (f*ck up) of our times. Explain that to me with your 101 economics please.

At this time Bitcoin is technically not able to handle such an event as an alternative payment system. Not even if the fiat system would colapse "slowly", lets say in a timeframe of 2 years or so. The amount of transactions per second to be processed needs to be in the millions per second. We are still far far from this point. Bitcoin as a store of vallue, thats something else though...

Never ever ever ever store that amount of Bitcoin online. Create 1 paper wallet per Bitcoin on an offline computer, preferable Ubuntu (Linux) booted from a usb stick. If you have the knowledge you can create pdfs and store them in an encrypted file (VeraCrypt) as a backup too. Use a paper wallet per Bitcoin as you can only spend the whole amount of it when you decide to use them. You can not partly spend Bitcoin from a paper wallet!

If you are willing to learn and spend 500 bucks on it you're fine. 
Buy Bitcoin in portions of 100 bucks, every week or so. This way you spread out the volatility a little bit. Hold them Bitcoins tight. Never sell when its going down (hard). Hold tight and enjoy the ride!

Technical privacy and security measures should be implemented by the code guru's. Treat users as scared 4 year old kids who can't read when they first start with new tech like Bitcoin. You won't give them the keys to a Ferrari will you? So start with a very user friendly app like Bitpay (Copay) and let them play with some dust. Otherwise they will be overwhelmed and become skeptical because its all too complicated. The right questions will follow on that. At least these are my best practises when introducing Bitcoin and it seems to work well.
@_date: 2016-12-12 11:47:10
It seems to me you have invested quite some time to gain knowledge about our current financial system. That is why I am always surprised when I meet and talk to people like you. You defend it and are well convinced everything is fine because we have governments and central banks taking care of it. It’s the biggest illusion of our time, and no I am not wearing a tinfoil hat all day…
Nowadays money == debt. The system needs to keep growing with debt indefinitely to stay alive and this is just impossible. Have a look at this  . Please don’t tell me it is quite normal all debt on earth is growing exponentially.
Let go of the illusion our financial system is fine and that quantitative easing is “normal”. The current financial system is almost at its end and quantitative easing is a draconic measure taken by central banks to extend the system a bit longer. But from a mathematical perspective the system simply cannot hold and will implode eventually.
Look, in my opinion humans live by illusions and concepts in our brains simply because we have the ability to do this. It makes us humans. It’s just time for a better and improved illusion (concept).
Let me answer your statements using my illusions and concepts. Oh and facts, I love facts:


In my believe the adoption of a new financial system consists several phases. We are still at the very beginning of user adoption of Bitcoin. So yes, I agree with your statement the Bitcoin price is determined almost completely by demand for the currency… at this time. But while reading your paragraph, you first state Bitcoin is a speculative asset, later stating it is a currency. And that’s how I believe it will be. At this moment it still is very much a speculative asset, yes. But eventually when it’s userbase grows globally and actual payments with Bitcoin increase, it will act more and more as a very stable technology driven trustless global currency. The speculative part will ease out because you would need enormous amounts of money to make decent profits out of speculation; it’s plain simple math.
By the way I do not have the illusion of Bitcoin being our savior. It might well be a much better and improved “altcoin”. Altavista eventually got smashed by Google… But yes, I do have the illusion our future financial system will be technology driven. Not central government / bank driven.


Wow. Now this is really reassuring. The USD being backed by the full faith and credit of the United States and not by a commodity sitting in a vault is just perfect. But you know what this really means right? At this moment this means EVERY US citizen has to carry the debt of $61,329 and EVERY US taxpayer has to carry the debt of $166,757. It also means the FED can and has created money out of thin air making the USD loose purchasing power (value) dramatically. One USD in 1913 was worth 2341.7% more than one 2016 USD. Again this cannot continue indefinitely.


I did not say “assets are created by central banks”. I said MONEY is created out of thin air by central banks. How do you think the FED is taking these bad assets off of Banks balance sheets? They buy national loans, bonds, assets and they pay with money that did not exist before the purchase! The money is created electronically out of thin air. They don’t physically print the money, that’s the only thing what is true about your statement.
Recently a Dutch documentary actually showed this money creating process at the Dutch Central Bank, you can watch it here if you wish and scroll to 6:10.  
I understand Dutch is quite difficult to understand. To summarize; it shows how the Dutch central bank “creates” about 1,000,000,000 Euros a week out of thin air. It is part of the ECB program of creating 80,000,000,000 Euros each month in the Euro zone. The interviewer asks if this QE program is the first time this happens and the answer is; yes it’s the first time and we’ve created 1,400,000,000,000 Euros so far by doing this. During the day several moments of “money creation” occur. At 7:44 the documentary shows a “money creation” moment. This transaction created 22,900,000 Euros out of nothing by the click of a mouse button…


True, central banks don’t just “print money”. That would be too expensive and it’s not good for trees. They create money by the click of a mouse button. Our current financial system is rigged, flawed and broken. Our paradigm (illusion) of money need to change, preferably before our current financial system collapses otherwise it will get quite messy I’m afraid…

What I do to mine Bitcoin with a PC (actually, GPU's) is to mine Ethereum (ETH) and convert them using an exchange (I use BTC-E). Is it profitable? Only marginal. Is it fun? Yes!! And... you will learn a lot about the different blockchain technologies. I use a Ubuntu 14.04 rig with 2 ATI GPU's mining about 6 ETH per month which is about 0.1 Bitcoin at current exchange rates. 
If you still want to mine Bitcoin directly check out the new Antminer R4 which is aimed for home mining. As other people already mentioned, you need cheap power for it to be profitable!

Link to researchers report: 
Copy of text of conclusion:
6 Conclusion
The possibility to store non-financial data on cryptocurrency blockchains is both beneficial and threating for its users. Although controlled channels to insert non- financial data at small rates opens up a field of new applications such as digital notary services, rights management, or non-equivocation systems, objectionable or even illegal content has the potential to jeopardize a whole cryptocurrency. Although court rulings do not yet exist, legislative texts from countries such as Germany, the UK, or the USA suggest that illegal content such as child pornography can make the blockchain illegal to possess for all users.
As we have shown in this paper, a plethora of fundamentally different meth- ods to store non-financial–potentially objectionable–content on the blockchain exists in Bitcoin. As of now, this can affect at least 112 countries in which pos- sessing content such as child pornography is illegal. This especially endangers the multi-billion dollar markets powering cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.
To assess this problem’s severity, we comprehensively analyzed the quantity and quality of non-financial blockchain data in Bitcoin today. Our quantitative analysis shows that 1.4% of the roughly 251 million transactions in Bitcoin’s blockchain carry arbitrary data. We could retrieve over 1600 files, with new con- tent infrequently being added. Despite a majority of arguably harmless content, we also identify different categories of objectionable content. The harmful poten- tial of single instances of objectionable blockchain content is already showcased by findings such as links to illegal pornography or serious privacy violations.

You can create paper wallets and add the public btc addresses as watch only in your Blockchain.info wallet. This way you can check your funds but never spend them with Blockchain.info. Don't import the private keys if you have no intentions spending BTC straight away.

Thats probably not even the right quote from the right guy... rumors say this quote comes from Baron Rothchild a long long time ago. Still the advice remains pretty darn good. I’ll start buying again when we hit -/-90% from ATH. Did it last time (at $200 per BTC) and we all know what happened next...
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:34:21
Nahhh, as soon as we hit -/-90% from ATH I’ll start buying again. Statistics never lie...

@_date: 2016-09-05 11:21:25
Yep, but at that time you can use any other wallet supporting this option. 
When creating your paper wallet you have the option to encrypt the private key (BIP38  Be careful not to forget this password otherwise you won't be able to import the private key and your funds are stuck forever!

Oh and by the way... august 4, 2011 investors lost a staggering $2.3 trillion at the stock markets. A drop of $90 billion in value is a fucking sneeze compared to that. 
Aug. 4, 2011
Dropped 512.76 points
Fears that the country is headed for a double-dip recession, coupled with mounting concern that Spain and Italy will slump deeper into the European debt crisis, sparked the worst sell-off since the 2008 recession began. The Dow slid 512.76 points, dropping 4.3 percent. And while percentage-wise the market lost about a quarter as much as Black Thursday in 1929, for example, about $2.3 trillion in investor wealth had evaporated by the end of the day.

90% of the world doesn’t know what crypto currencies are let alone knows how to use it. The commodity market is a mature market. 
A 90% drop from $10.000 makes it $1.000... Don’t be so naive, this can happen easily. I’m in since 2012. Bought both at Gox ath of $1.300 and at a low of $190,- after that. A big warning to you. If you consider this kind of price movement “impossible”, you’re in big trouble.
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:03:22
You’re gonna loose money doing this! Always “swipe” paper wallets completely. Paper wallets are used for cold storage, not to use as an actual wallet. Second, after swiping a paper wallet never use if again.

There is a advanced opensource forensic timelining tool called "Plaso - Log2Timeline". This tool will create a timeline of almost everything that has happened on your system. 
Are you willing to share a digital forensicly imaged copy of your machine so I can examine your system using this tool. To make an forensic image of your system boot from a Kali Linux live USB stick and run the tool "Guymager". You need an external drive to store the image too! The files we need will be splitted E01 files. The files are splitted so its easier to transfer them.
Be aware that you will share a lot of privacy sensitive info/data this way as deleted files will and can be examined too! 
If you're interested PM me.

Why must we stick to the concept of Bitcoin being a "currency" instead of it being a commodity? I think it would fit much better treating Bitcoin as a piece of gold instead of using it as daily money. Its getting more and more obvious its not gonna work like that anyway.

This sudden price rally triggers my Gox PTSS...

How have your 3 days as Redditor been so far? Enjoying yourself sir?
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:42:43
Still price is going down just as fast...
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:48:43
Sold 18 of my 21 BTC at $1,450... need to say more :-(
@_date: 2018-12-28 19:34:46
How old r u? 12?
@_date: 2016-07-08 19:37:50
It seems you could handle bigger blocks...
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:02:55
BTW... it costs a bit less right now ;)
@_date: 2018-12-22 03:27:53
Guess you were hibernating in 2014 when it crashed over 80% from its peak late 2013...
@_date: 2017-06-10 07:27:44
As soon as you get that loan and bought your Bitcoins you'll get pretty anxious when the price drops 30% overnight and another 30% de period to follow... It happened before and it will happen again.

Some will have a lot more than 100k on Kraken... 
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:49:40
Because people are selling for lower prices than before...
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:45:10
No. I'm saying AltaVista and Netscape got replaced by much better technology. Even though Bitcoin is pioneer technology like AltaVista and Netscape where, it will be replaced by better technology if it doesn't evolve and improve fast enough.
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:46:15
BS. This is simple human psychology and statistics at play. What goes up really fast WILL come down really fast. Waiting for -/- 90% from ATH then I’ll start buying again. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:53:56
BS. Too many conspiracy psycho’s out here. This is simple human psychology and statistics at play. What goes up really  fast WILL come down really fast. Waiting for -/- 90% from ATH then I’ll start buying again.

You have a magic ball? It is activated when it is activated, not earlier than that!

Lost = lost ! They're gone forever!

How much I love your statement, Bitcoin is already poisoned by politics, power and control. Bitcoin stopped being de-centralized at the moment the Chinese started producing ASICS and mining farms. 
Another thing. Mass public simply DOES NOT THINK FOR ITSELF as soon as they have all moderate and comfortable lives. They don't care all money, media and data is in control of a very small group of people and companies. Its the countries where shit has hit the fan a revolution can start from, but the rest of the world is still hibernating.

Lets see... when the bubble pops you gonna need do hodl for a looooong time again.
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:43:53
Waiting for -/-90% from ATH threshold... 
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:46:20
Bitcoin can be very volatile and hodling for the long term always seemed to be the best strategy. If you were in for the quick buck, sorry for you and rule 1 applies. Rule 1: Dont use money you cant afford to loose.

Bitmain is a manufacturer of Bitcoin Mining hardware. They have huge mining facilities too. Therfor, a big part of the Bitcoin hashing power comes from them, making them quite powerful...
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:28:38
Http:// . They are located in NL too and have a very good rep. Succes en groeten!
PS: Heb je een goeie stroomleverancier want anders is het niet rendabel in NL...
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:29:22
Its gonna dip at least -/-90 % from ATH so $2,000 is not that bad to bottom out...
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:17:27
At this time, yes. And newbies need to learn just like we did!
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:03:18
So its the best deal in the history of deals!
@_date: 2018-12-01 06:02:21
I will never believe Satoshi is an individual... Bitcoin (and its white-paper) is too brilliant to come from one mind.
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:09:12
I’m into Bitcoin since 2013 and it has been a great ride so far. But there is a pattern. People tend to loose their minds and stop using common sense when it comes to Bitcoin. Bitcoin price up (too) fast —&gt; woooooowww mass adoption!!!! We’re gonna conquer the world!!!. Bitcoin price down fast —&gt; It’s all a big conspiracy against BTC!!! Pffff gimme a break...

@_date: 2017-06-27 00:30:56
Short answer. Its pointless for you to mine Bitcoin. Electricity bill will be too high for you to make profit. Buy Bitcoin and hold it!
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:07:35
Yeah thats what happens during a bubble period... you did good cashing out in time.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:58:29
Here comes the drop!
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:33:15
You know after the previous price run AND crash we've got several suicide posts here by people who did the same thing you are suggesting, right? In other words, don't be stupid by being too greedy. Its not good for your health.
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:52:51
YOU CANT HACK MY MAC BECAUSE... well... ITS A MAC! But don't forget to put some tape on your Mac's camera while jerking off will ya?

Why kill a tree for a stupid book?
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:12:01
Bought a new house and car... thanks BTC! Remember peepzzz, buy low (-/-90% from ATH) and sell high. Its quite simple actually.

You already said it... because from France ;) 
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:50:54
Your post is not gonna do shit against human mass psychology. Price went up too fast so it will go down fast as well! It will bottem higher as previous bottem probably though...

You need to zoom out, you’re in a tunnel... 
@_date: 2018-12-01 05:56:54
Why and who cares? It seems you are denying the bear market period we’re in...
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:21:36
Very right sir.  Plain old human psychology and statistics at play here. The rest is big BS. What goes up too fast will come down even faster, simple.
@_date: 2017-06-27 01:26:24
Did you Google "Bitcoin difficulty" already? You wont mine 0.5 Bitcoin every month...
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:08:03
A book? Who needs books when we have the webzzz?
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:03:36
This is BS... it should be a couple of cents and it should be fast! The transaction could also be about 70 bucks, same fees apply atm!
