Was it a mistake to take my kids 529 account and sink it into BTC? 
Its down about 20% since I invested it, but Ive got 10 years before he needs it! 
The market is killing it ! But the 529 Admins are killing it even more. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:50:45
Ok so can someone explain to me what this represents exactly? 
@_date: 2018-08-13 14:06:12
Ok the cover photo of the video the lower right-hand corner has a yellow(ish) ball. Its connected to the northeast to a pink ball. This yellow ball remains largely unchanged through the video.

I'm not so sure. 5 years sitting in a 529 in their "aggressive growth" portfolio I think had an IRR of around 6% less fees. About half of what it would have been in the market. 
Its only about 1/2 a BTC so its not a big deal but I have more faith in emerging tech than I do in account managers. I also don't trust the 529's. They are managed by states...same as pension funds and some bonds etc. We see very well how all of those accounts work out! 
I think the BTC was a good bet at the time. The only thing I think i didnt anticipate was how successful the markets would be preforming under this administration. If they keep doing this well for another 6 years BTC will probably not work out as well as an index. 
IDK hard to tell. Overall I dont think Im going to lose anything.

YUP! Shut the Front door! 
About a year ago I hit up google to find the locations of all BTC ATM's in Dallas and Fort Worth! 
Suprise Suprise they are almost ALL in like shitty little shady convenience stores. Located in bad neighborhoods. 
I had an instant appifinany of how the little store has been surviving with bare shelves and almost no customers. 
Hmmm I wonder why?? What could be going on??

Ok thanks but I'm not sure I follow what you are saying. 
You are saying you use windows 10 as the OS, MSI Afterburner as the software and are connecting to your rig mother board by "RDC"?

Ummm....They do understand this is a different type of "mining" right?? LOL
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:51:47
Perhaps a difference of opinion. 
You think: "Bitcoin drops for some unknown reason, people sell their personal belongings (at arguably the worst time of year to do so) and buy bitcoin" 
I Think: "People want to buy shit, and start converting solid assets (stock bonds and yes bitcoin) into liquid ones. Thus causing price to fall"
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:30:30
Well you are obviously an authority here.

If Wall Street (I mean this in general referring to the giant banks whose business is trading assets) is anything they are insanely efficient. 
You and I, in general, are not. So you and I will benefit from a large upside like a BTC run to 20K. We are essentially long positions. 
Wall Street, on the other hand, can capitalize on the predictable inefficiencies of you and I more than they can from a position similar to ours. 
In this way, they quickly buy the dips and sell the spikes, over and over again very fast. The result we see looks like a very stable BTC. When in reality is just large fast institutions siphoning off value faster than the market can react. 
If you go back and look at this, the phenomenon began when the big banks announced the 1st ETF's. Many BTC traders lauded this as a good thing in the sense that it was legitimizing BTC in the financial sector. Without realizing that the legitimization came at the cost of loss of control.

Is the PDF available? 
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:40:39
On the contrary its good math....just bad policy.
@_date: 2018-10-11 17:58:16
Maybe...not sure! 
I never thought that BTC owners wanted "stability" per say. I thought they wanted recognition as a legitimate alternative and not just a scam or scheme.
I would venture that BTC owners wanted "recognition" in the anticipation that retailers would suddenly jump onboard and the price and utility of BTC would keep or accelerate upwards.  
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:29:48
I hope everyone realizes this is the impact of wall street in BTC. 
They are much more efficient in making trades and are continuous, buying and selling to suck all the profit off the top of BTC. 
Its how you control BTC.

Did you DIY the coin and just print stickers?
@_date: 2019-02-21 20:47:16
You should write them back and say something like
"Thanks for intruding on my privacy...I realize your POS service is a temporary disillusionment created by PayPal to stem the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. And while you may be interested to know what my transaction was for. Perhaps I'm sending money to notorious criminals, perhaps its a payment to Fidel Castro, perhaps it's my order for 2 underage Cuban prostitutes. But truth be told I dont really give two fat rats fucking about what you want. So please take this note with all kindness and regards and literally fuck your own face with it!"
