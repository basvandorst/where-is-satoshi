The merchant needs to add OpenNode as a payment option.

Customers do not need to KYC

It's interesting people jump to conclusions and immediately demonize a company. We don't live in a perfect world and ON or any other company that requires KYC is only following the letter of the law as it exists today. As cool as it is to run your own server and be decentralized, you open yourself up to millions of dollars in fines from the regulating entities. Bottom line, you can't transmit money without certain licenses.

That’s my point. As a payment processor, those rules apply. If you spin up your own node and become a payment processor those rules apply. Opennode is a bitcoin payment processor, the rules apply. If you decide to spin up your own node, you become a payment processor, as such these rules apply. The fines are in the MILLIONS. The idea that people can spin up their own node and not apply these rules is patently false.

The customer does not have to KYC. The merchant/Developer using OpenNode or running their own pay server has to KYC/KYB to be compliant in facilitating transactions. The merchant if they want to run their own server has to be AML compliant, and spend 100s of thousands to get those licenses. Or they can use OpenNode. But in order for OpenNode to be able to facilitate the transmission of money for merchants, they have to KYC/KYB the merchant otherwise they are not compliant. It sucks, but is the reality.
