Bitcoin's purpose was to further r/Decentralization. We have been overtaken by many traders. We are the few,  but the patriots are still here

Thanks for the comment. You're literally watching what your portfolio would be if you were willing to invest that amount of money. We’ve had people who never traded Crypto in their lives try this out. Once they had the chance to see for themselves how it works, they felt more comfortable with investing their own money. For most of us, it's just a game between friends. My fantasy portfolio looks nothing like my real one. 
Aside from that, Cryptex is a wonderful group filled with traders, analysts, miners, and developers in the Cryptocurrency space. We collect knowledge and share what we found amongst each other. Our main focus isn’t even the Fantasy trading, it’s just a neat thing we added that we thought people would be interested in. :)

r/decentralization is the way of the future. It being a fixed currency gives me way more faith than the alternative

Thank you, I wanted to provide value to the Crypto community. I think there are many of us that wanted a place to speak with others on their thoughts/predictions.
