Charisma's tremendously important, don't be foolish. Perhaps you're confusing being charismatic with being a good liar. The Winklevosses aren't liars, and they'll need a great deal of charisma to convince a bunch of dads why BTC is important and not a big scam.

The title, too. We don't need this sort of propaganda, we're trying to be taken seriously and legitimate.
If those involved were laundering money for drugs then they committed an international crime, legally. The medium being BTC is inconsequential to the fact, and the philosophical debate on whether drugs are bad is for another time.

So far they've been pretty positive. It's no longer a matter of whether Bitcoin is a plague or not, but rather: it's here, so how do we protect customers, institutions, and regulate it to avoid exploitation. It's all quite positive.
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:11:22
I believe what you're trying to articulate and what I'm trying to articulate are different things, and different elements of Bitcoin. Integration and regulation doesn't apply (and isn't thinking about, frankly) people using it amongst themselves for their our consumerist purposes. Just like nobody cares what you do with the cash you have in your pocket. But to pay bills with? To exchange BTC for FIAT in a bank? To insure your car with? To buy a home with? There will be regulation in these elements of use, because there's financial and legal risk there, both to the consumers and to the institutions that are involved in your future day-to-day use of BTC.
So if you want to use BTC however you'd like on Silk Road, the future equivalent to tossing your dealer a Benjamin for a bag of pot, nobody can really track your exchange and nobody really cares. But don't expect to be able to Dark Wallet your insurance payments through your bank's website from an anonymous account. You've signed contracts in certain conditions now, and they'll be revised and updated if/when BTC becomes a common currency.
edit: "Cares" is perhaps too glib of a word to use here, but there will always (and has always) been fringe groups avoiding regulation and making use of black markets. Regulators are aware of this, as are anyone invested in the coin. But for now, it's about consumer protection and infrastructure integration, and that's what the talks are about.
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:45:38
Your heated fringe doesn't anything of mine in a wad, no worries. But thankfully there are plenty of very large backers for the Bitcoin project that do want to be taken seriously, and are working towards mainstream integration. Bitcoin will be the next PayPal if they have anything to say about it, and wont get there by putting a recognized criminal on a cross, whether his medium of choice was BTC or not.
You should watch the NYDFS heatings that have been going on:  they're quite interesting. Charlie Lee of Litecoin spoke, as well as Fred Wilson, and we've got Fred Ehrsam (Coinbase) speaking today. The Winklevoss twins were yesterday as well. Lots of big names who aren't interested in some pro-drugs, Dark Wallet fringe campaign. They're leaving that to you.
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:43:58
True, but regulation also means those able to use the site are far less likely to wake up and find the owner of the site took everyone's Bitcoin balances and fled to Bermuda.
Regulation is a double-edged sword, and hopefully China comes around on the new normal that is Bitcoin.

You get more flies with honey. If you want to be taken seriously, as a new frontier of the economic world, you can't be associated with drug money launderers. Him 'resigning' was an adult move. It showed, despite what individual opinions are on drugs and their harm, the time and place for such a talk isn't amidst international laundering charges. Don't be silly.

Well, their unreal overhead inflating their asking price simply takes the tall hurdle of procurement difficulty and turns it into the medium-sized hurdle of cost. But it is a nice step forward for sure. People understand credit card = things.
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:30:53
I assure you, those with millions invested in the coin know about how their investments can be perceived as deconstructive and negative. The panel may not be aware of the specifics, but they're aware there's always a way to get around regulation. With Bitcoin or anything.
But those speaking to the panel don't bring up, or otherwise deliberately avoid the methods/possibilities of exploitation because that doesn't help what they and those of us interested in the currency as a mainstream medium look to achieve: legitimacy, security and integration.
Those thinking Coinjoin or the Dark Wallet is the seedy, true intention of making BTC acceptable are as delusional as assuming the NYDFS isn't aware there are ways to exploit this service and use it as a black market medium.
But there are plenty of ways to launder and obfuscate FIAT transfers, so the point's more or less moot in the context of seeing if Bitcoin's right to be integrated into our existing infrastructures.
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:25:17
While he kept himself firmly in the realm of volatility risk hysteria (which is his position, fairly), he did bring up points that many chainmail dads still have: that holding Bitcoin can be very risky, that its value could be artificially inflated, that it's not as cheap or smooth as everyone claims, and if we're really going over the cliff: that Bitcoin is or could be a shady market controlled by trade cartels or be 51%'d relatively easily with enough money.
The other professors did a good job at mitigating his simplified concerns, and what I consider fringe fears, but they're not uncommon ones. Ones you've all got family members or coworkers who've expressed. And for Bitcoin to grow and thrive and become adopted institutionally, they're speculative fears that need to be addressed.
So with that said, I'm glad they had him on as a surprise panelist from the other side of the table. We need to address these concerns— as hysteric as some of them may be— now, before the regulatory laws are being written up so as to not make any error.
I didn't like his presumption that Bitcoin usage *itself* could come with a higher (he cited 9%) fee than credit cards groups, though. That was a cheap pass and one that wasn't entirely truthful. Bitcoin services could come in with higher fees sure (the Bitcoin ATM charges what? 7%?), but a consumer-to-consumer usage will very rarely see that level of fee, if any, and that choice for the consumer is an important factor for keeping fees low. That we don't *have* to use an institution or credit card to perform an exchange.
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:56:35
Dishonest may be a stretch, but he was definitely coming from a very specific angle, so yeah, he was picking which facts that best fit his case and avoiding others.
I did like that he made the claim of an absurd volatility, then the Silk Road crackdown and the Charlie Shrem arrest was made as a case for further scrutiny on Bitcoin officials and bodies (also as a case for the ease of ledger tracking and a case against the presumed anonymity), but then they asked Williams what this big deal had on the market and his only response was, "It fluctuates every day, I couldn't say." So that more or less sells me that he's not keeping tabs on the coin, that he's not as fluidly educated on how events affect market volatility, and he's just regurgitating what he's there to say. But fine, they're hysterical speculations that need to be aired. The old world mental state needs to be educated.
And while I agree regulation isn't perfect, and you're right there is a lot of foul play amongst big bodies that are otherwise "regulated", we can't be naive on the other hand either, and assume all regulation is bad, that it's just some headless institutional hive mind trying to worm its tentacles into your beloved freemarket, that we need to maintain this Wild West, and yada-yada-yada.
A number of us backers are trying to be taken seriously, and to be taken seriously you need to play by the rules that've been established in the countries where they apply. Like them or not, exploitation or not, there're pros and cons with both regulation and a lack there of. Let's not pretend the Bitcoin market hasn't seen pump &amp; dumps, which would be illegal in many cases under a more regulated market, and they aren't presently. People with an angle will cite cases where P&amp;Ds occurred in regulated markets, but they'll conveniently ignore many more cases that have seen arrests under the same regulation. There's going to be exploitation in any framework, and pirates may just re-brand as profiteers when regulations crack down on present schemes, so what needs to be done is to protect the users as best you can with what tools you have, which is what these talks are all about.

The cross-exchange gap on exchanges like LibertyBit and outer-US exchanges is massive, too (talking $30+ frequently enough). A group that could make cross-trading viable for more exchanges than just the usuals (BTC-e, Gox, Vircurex, Bitstamp) would make a killing.
I hope to see further outer-US exchange coverage as you build your platform.
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:34:47
Tremendously doubtful, but there may be some responsive fluctuation. Some people are likely to sell off what little BTC they're playing with out of fear that Silk Road's 'gone', but it'll be back up, and if not, there will be and are other narcotic marketplaces available. It's an inexhaustible, highly profitable market, so it's never going to go away.
Short answer: There will never not be some kind of Silk Road, and crypto-currencies will do just fine with or without.

For sure, but it'll level out. The coin doesn't stay below $100 for long now-a-days, so I doubt we'll see it fall too much further. It's a fairly well-tested floor.
Plus it's a blessing, perhaps. Having your primary investors all just investing to prop up their drug habits may not be the soundest long-term model. The more coins shook out of their pockets into more stable party's may add stability to the value, and frankly, a more professional appearance.
@_date: 2013-09-10 01:21:05
Yeah, it's just a monitoring aggregator from what I can tell. It does nothing to mitigate the actual processes involved in cross-exchange trading.
So essentially you need to keep FIAT and BTC balances in all exchanges you want to trade on, this you handle yourself; TruCoin wont do this. And then you buy/sell through TruCoin as you normally would, but to transfer BTC or FIAT balances between exchanges you need to do that yourself, too; TruCoin wont do that.
So all they are is a consolidated live ticker that you can buy/sell through with API permissions, but the cross-exchange trading support is limited to zero.
Open up three tabs in your browser, one to Clark Moody's live tracker, one to your BTC-e account, and the other to your Gox account. There, you've just re-created TruCoin.

There was more to my conversation with him, I was just gisting, so I'll address your bullets individually as I understood his case. Ours was more an argument on obtaining coins, though, not circumstances once he had them,
* There are some minor fees transferring money from/to your wallet, that goes to the miners for operational expenses. There are also transfer fees associated with getting money in/coins out of exchanges, which is the only really reliable place to acquire coins presently.
* This is true, but it's not short compared to the time it takes to use a credit card online.
* This is also true, but he's just your average consumer, and had no need to worry about funding transfers beyond possibly $500 a day, and very rarely if ever transferring large sums abroad.
* True, but what average consumer, assuming we were switched entirely over to Bitcoin, would ever want to spend all of the money they had? It's a speculative restriction at best for someone who, at most, spends $10 a day on lunch.
* Addressed somewhat in the first bullet point, but this is valid enough compared to credit card interest, bank fees, sales tax, etc.
* Those third-party, centralized institutions bring personal security along with the restrictions and fees associated with them, though. His fear that you could very well lose your 'bank account' if your laptop crashed was enough to have the idea not settle right. I know (and educated him) that it's irresponsible to keep all your money in a single wallet on your laptop, but let's be honest, how security-minded and intelligent is your average person with their money?
I'm not trying to pick at your arguments, though. I'm very much a supporter of crypto-currencies. I'm just trying to rationalize the switch with the viewpoint of your average, law-abiding, center-left, 9-to-5, lower-middle class person who just wants to buy the occasional book online and a nice lunch and not think or fuss too much, and is willing to pay a fee for that absentminded convenience.
@_date: 2013-04-29 05:48:49
Hype helps short term, but it doesn't help long term. It causes panic interest when the coin shows promise, and panic flight when it shows weakness. Instability will cause degradation for the coin's perceived long-term value. Long-term stability of, not just Bitcoin but crypto-currencies on a whole, require infrastructural investment from businesses, and the only reason they'd do that is if a large enough consumer base desires it. So keep requesting it of your favourite businesses. Send them emails, ask them when they're going to start accepting Bitcoins. Link them to BitPay as a viable merchant solution, etc. If they get enough requests they'll look into it, even if they respond to you with 'we have no current plans'. You need to plant the seeds. Remember when it was rare companies would accept PayPal? Albeit PayPal had a much smaller hurdle.
From the consumer angle, educate people on the current two largest fears of crypto-currencies: That banks/governments hate it (valid, but not necessarily true), and that it's difficult to convert money to coins (true, but not necessarily impossible). These two hurdles are the current biggest public interest blocks, and once they're gone, and enough business start showing that little 'we accept Bitcoin!' banner, BTC will become commonplace.

Honestly, the best [read: healthiest] thing you can do if you're holding out long-term is to stop watching the ticker. Close the window, don't look at it. Highs and lows happen, it's part of the game. There will be more more bubbles, more pump &amp; dumps, more drama. It's all part of the game.
But none of that matters long term. Your job to improve your investment is to get the word out and make BTC accepted more places. Don't watch the ticker.

The potential to be very disruptive and damaging far outweighs the benefit as I see it. It's a direct source of pump&amp;dump/short&amp;distort tactics that, from a trader confidence perspective, should be mitigated as much as possible. The fewer tools people trying to manipulate the markets have, the better.
I don't even think the order books should be visible, really, since there's lots of room for people to cause undue panic there as well, but this is the 'wild west' of forex trading, so we've got a long way to go before this whole game is made presentable and professional.
Plus just from a business image perspective, if anyone who wanted to start trading came to BTC-e, the first thing they see are a bunch of children throwing up what's essentially stock fraud, along with emoticons and bullshit banter, it doesn't appear professional or trustworthy to potential investor's who want to deposit funds.

The problem isn't that they think Gox is the only place, the problem is the trade volume is comparatively insignificant on [most] other exchanges. I'm talking minutes between trades of relatively small volume. Only Gox currently lends well to something close to day trading.
A con with the decentralized aspect of the coin, if you can call it a con, is that not only the ownership of the currency is decentralized, but so are the traders. Everyone will tend to centralize themselves under one or two exchanges because that's where the action is.
Plus some exchanges, because they're dealing with such low trade volume, have wildly above-market selling points, and move very slowly against market fluctuation. While this can work in your favour, seeing the price drop $20 on Gox, while your exchange is still selling at the price it was all 6 hours ago can be painful, and an incentive to drop the tiny exchanges and move to Gox.
What would be neat to see is an exchange aggregator of some sort. Then it wouldn't matter what your exchange of preference is. The issue there is cross-exchange action fees and account ownership and yada-yada, though.

We appreciate your open-mindedness on, not just Bitcoin, but crypto-forex in general. Like you and everyone's said, there are plenty of markets out there, and to put all your eggs in just the Bitcoin basket may be short-sighted. Litecoin, especially, has be toted as the silver to Bitcoin's gold, and I'm sure any diversification in revenue streams your business has access to would be taken welcomely.

That article (and this title) is somewhat bias, and misleading. The Reuters article is a little more level-handed:
Essentially Poland has two pension buckets a private one (OFE, held by banks, brokers, etc.) and a public one (ZUS, government held). Poland's taking over the private bucket and adding it to the public one to make their national debt % appear less on paper (giving a bump to the public assets, and giving them another reason to avoid national debt).
So really it boils down to a nationalism quibble. And it doesn't really apply to Bitcoin anymore than a story of a man being mugged for his cash does (his friend who had only Bitcoins not affected).
edit: Even that analogy isn't very good, since nobody's being mugged here. It's a juggling of ownership, not a confiscation in the loss sense of the word from the pensioners perspective.

Yeah, this has been a concern of mine with the recent mining hardware trends. There's going to be some value exploitation on the manufacturers part as Bitcoin ramps up and everyone thinks they'll make it big off mining.
Out of curiosity, is there a site out there that would do the calculations for you on how long it would take a person to mine back the cost of these units? Taking into consideration average mining return, electricity costs, etc, etc? Starting in a $22.5k hole before you even turned the rig on seems like an awful start to any sort of lucrative mining operation, especially at current difficulty levels.

The problem is, too, is that your options right now are a Craigslist-style hand-off, which many find slow and sketchy, which can also fall prey to charge-backs. And your other option is to sign-up for an exchange, which takes some time to get verified, usually means a walk to the bank, and you start getting nickled &amp; dimed by trade fees, withdrawal fees, etc.
Someone I know once argued, "If I'm getting fee'd either way, and I don't care about anonymity or taking down the man, what's the difference between this and my credit card?" And frankly, I didn't have an answer that would satisfy him.

The linked article brings up many other points that carry weight to the issue. It's not really an issue with 'unintended people stumbling across bad messages', it's a matter of Bitcoin networks being used to transmit data and all that comes with that.

I don't see how that's a surprise, or amusing even really. New regulations on cryptocurrencies are made, that's bound to happen, and things change. The US feds were acting on their new regulations and doing their job. Gox got nipped (or rather those US-based groups working with Gox were/will get nipped), but they'll probably be allowed to re-apply appropriately and hopefully re-gather their US-based customers.

Granted, it's up to whomever wants to use the coin, but from a developmental standpoint, from the standpoint of wanting Bitcoin (and other crypto-currencies) to succeed, and not be blacklisted by banks, discredited by countries, you don't want to be getting public thumbs-ups from crime syndicates and abusively-wealthy tax shelter seekers.
It's their prerogative, but it wont help the image. And not everyone (I dare even say not the majority) who supports or would like to support crypto-currencies are anti-government, or even anti-tax.

True, but cross-exchange comparison is used in trades. When your primary exchange is down like Gox is, then you go to a site like this:

It depends on which market interest you're relating the movement to. From a consumer use perspective? No, why would LTC move in tandem with BTC. BTC has uses, is being adopted by businesses, LTC's not.
From a purely speculative trade market perspective? Sure, maybe. Crypto-currencies are going to be a big trading market 10 years from now, mark my words. It wont be about Bitcoin alone, cryptos will be traded like highly-volatile stocks.
And then you have the 'post-rush miners' angle, where BTC becomes more difficult and less profitable to mine as the difficulty rises, forcing miners to find other cryptos to experiment with, so BTC becoming mainstream make cause splashdown to other cryptos in that regard. The miner drain may also result in slower BTC transactions, and if LTC already promises faster transactions that drain may work to its advantage.
And who's to say other cryptos wont see consumer-acceptance. 'Virtual Currency' isn't just Bitcoin. Plenty of factors at play. This is all speculative, of course, but that's crypto-currencies in general.

I don't know if this is the take-away from what his friend said. I don't know the whole context or conversation, and while I agree with you on the "If you can't afford to lose, don't bet," anecdote, I think the better take away is how brief and unsupported pure speculation is.
So perhaps it should be phrased: If everyone interested in Bitcoin is just interested in it rising in value, get out. If nobody spends, and nobody promotes the coin to businesses like they should, eventually everyone will realize the valueless-ness of the coin, and everyone will bail.
Hope's great, but work's a better bet.

Welllll, while it's true popular media has blown the criminal undercurrent of Bitcoin far out of proportion, I mean Lybian rebel groups aren't buying AK-47s with Bitcoins or anything quite so definitively criminal, the fact is a major element (or what degree you can consider major) of Bitcoin's use is Silk Road, and other sites that cater to drug and substance enthusiasts.
Now while the moral or ethical pitfalls in that criminal demographic are up for debate, it is considered criminal by law, so to that degree Bitcoin is providing a safer avenue for people to purchase drugs, and so in that sense Bitcoin is providing a safe haven for criminals.
And it's not a small sum. When Silk Road was blackmailed a few months back or whenever it was, and their site DDOSed into the ground, and there was speculation it may not come back up, we saw a big correction in the BTC market. Like a market shifting correction. So we can't speculate the Silk Road influence is small.
But personal drug use is just legally criminal, there's little ethically criminal about it, so it depends on what criminal element we're talking about here.

Yeah, definitively, but it's a different nuance than what's intended by it's usage in the title I think. The Polish government is telling the private pension sector to fuck off, and nationalizing the cash cow, but not telling the pensioners to fuck off, and taking their money. The title implies the government is taking money from its citizens.
So yeah I guess that line was a bit of a troll, but it's down to semantics.

Well when the big bubble popped the floor presented was around $70, and it very quickly found buoyancy and rifled back up to around $115. Then there was some floundering and a bit of a panic that saw the price drop to $60 or so in another flight, and then again everyone rushed in to gobble up the displacement and we saw a rebound back up to $118 before another drop.
Then highs/lows of $155, $127, $149 then now this drop that brought us down to $96, and it's held today. And right now we're seeing a buy-back to bring it up to $104.
So whatever the market deems the coin is worth, it's around $100 right now. That seems to be where the current waterline is, and what I'm willing to say is the new normal.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:04:43
The floor of sub-$100 has been tested multiple times since the big bubble. Any action below that mark corrects very quickly. There's certainly a floor, don't spark any unnecessary hype.

I appreciate the tips. Nobody on LBCs are offering the volume I need, sadly, but I'll give it a shot and register. Who knows.
I've got a value in mind, and I have no problem paying above market price if it means both the seller and myself come out of it without an exchange shekeling us.

Granted, there's a lot of risk with speculative trading in general, but so is there with sitting on 5500 coins hoping one day the world adopts them. It's just two types of trading strategies. The quick &amp; dirty faithless vs. the long &amp; loyal faithful.
But day trading is a legitimate form of Forex trading, that'll never go away. Whether the coin becomes anything aside, crypto-forex is a brand new trading platform and very exciting. Good traders know how to read the candles and if they're trading a large enough volume they can make a living off it even now.
The beautiful thing with volatile, speculative markets, as Bitcoin is currently, is if played right they're very quickly profitable. A $20, 20% swing is huge compared to traditional Forex trading where a speculative value my rise or fall fractions of a cent, and with the incentive that it'll only go up long-term? The risk is minimized. It also means they don't need to have faith in the coin. They're making money right now, so who cares if one day the coin's made illegal.
I know you're not looking for long-winded rants, so I apologize. It's just all very exciting from the perspective of someone who loves traditional Forex trading. This crypto stuff is like the 19th c. gold rush of the Americas.

My timetable is flexible, but the sooner the better. If you're actually able to aid me, that would be great. Message me for an email if you'd like.
I'm indifferent on the anonymity part, though to be honest, it's just the lengthy exchange time, rounding up all those coins from various sources, and fees I'd like to mitigate if possible.

Like I said, the sums are inconsequential, but that's hardly the point. They're irrecoverable beyond the first decimal point. A balance of 0.04444444 BTC is presently worth $6.13, which is yours, but you can't collect it. So technically, anything that can't be rounded up to 0.1 on BTC-e is theirs, not yours.

Those are all fine points, honestly they are, but I'm talking about your average consumer.
Your average consumer doesn't sell things on eBay, maybe the occasional craft or old tools, but those typically go on Craigslist or to friends. They're spur shoppers, not sellers. Your average consumer doesn't browse Silk Road, they get pot from their friends, if at all. Your average consumer doesn't buy things from people they don't trust, they buy from Amazon almost exclusively in a lot of cases, otherwise they'll walk over to BestBuy or Walmart or Walgreens. Your average consumer doesn't finance anybody abroad, and typically lives with some amount of personal debt. Your average consumer's understanding of global events comes from CNN, FOX, or the BBC.
I'm talking about your average, white, lower-middle class, 35 to 55-year-old. They have a job they're not thrilled about, they have an hefty mortgage on a little two-bedroom, they have a kid or three, and a truck.
These are the masses, and these are the people that still see Bitcoin as a 'newfangled geek internet thing'. Just imagine your mom or dad, and try to figure out how they can regularly use, or more importantly want to use Bitcoin vs. their MasterCard. It's not easy to understand why they would.
We'll get there eventually, but Bitcoin has to be made easier, has to be able to be used like average consumers use credit, and in the same places.

The 'crackdowns' aren't as widespread or as all encompassing as the hype makes them out to be. VirtEx got into some risk-related trouble with their bank, but they're alive right now and doing fine.
And if Gox shuts down a smart entrepreneur will start another right up again. That's the beauty of decentralization, there's no 'heart' of the business.
Short answer: No. Bitcoin's fine. There'll be bumps, but bumps come with everything.

I've experimented with EMT for smaller sums, cash and wire for larger sums. All of which are pretty quick. EMT is capped at $1000, but it's the fastest general route, and takes around 24 hours, never any longer I've found.
The fastest route for me was cash, but I happen to luck out with living in the same city this exchange is hosted, and can walk right over to their bank. I took a deposit slip directly over to their bank and then called LibertyBit to confirm as I was walking out the door. The money was in my LibertyBit account before I got back to the office from the trip to the bank. I've also done the same thing and emailed them instead and it's just a few hours slower, but still intra-day.
I assume a wire would take the typical 48-72 hours.
edit: It's worth noting, too, their fee structure seems to be loose as well. They claim it's an extra fee for submitting cash over I believe $7200 but I received no such extra fee and had done it more than once. They're good people.

It's true, it's a very nationalistic move, one you don't see often, and there's risk with keeping all your investments in one bucket, which was sort of forced on the pensioners by the Polish government here. Always diversify kids. But its threat depends on how much trust you have in your federal government vs. how much trust you have in your bank, and what your political poise is in general to private vs. public.
@_date: 2013-09-06 19:34:15
Exactly. It's just smart business. If you can't force a disruptive new currency out of your game, you figure out how to have it make money for you.
So they introduce Bitcoin (or cryptos in general perhaps) into your PayPal wallet, and skim transaction fees off you, instead of trying to force you not to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:41:06
What timepad said, BitPay's fine for now as long as it keeps some things in mind:
* 1) Fees. PayPal is going to rape people with fees, because it's their MO. If BitPay can undercut 
them in this regard they'll have a better footing.
* 2) Further crypto-currency support. BitPay's given everyone who's asked for alternative crypto-currency support static, saying Bitcoin's the way to go. I bet with this news they'll be looking at other crypto-currency support a lot more to scoop up residual market share for when PayPal jumps in.
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:48:29
That looks to be $0.5m, not $0.5b, but yeah.
And by all reason, we need BitPay. People who hate PayPal (a very sizable lot) will be looking for alternatives, so BitPay will never really go away in that regard.

I should've clarified, sorry, I had browsed Localbitcoins first, and the volume isn't what I need. Few in my area offering more than 25 coins, and those who have as much as 150 are expecting far above market price for them.
Also Localbitcoins comes with [some horror stories]( but I guess all mediums will to a degree.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:06:03
LibertyBit because they have better rates and are more responsive than VirtEx, and Canadian options are sadly limited. I've gone from cash in my hand to BTC in my wallet inside of a few hours with LibertyBit, they move quickly and don't nickle and dime you on every damn action.
Otherwise I'd use Gox since that's where the action is.
@_date: 2013-09-06 23:59:56
eBay would lose billions.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:08:19
Seconded. LibertyBit shekels just 0.5%, flat.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:23:40
Unless you can undercut LibertyBit's rates (so far all your Deposit/Withdraw rates seem to mirror LibertyBit's, which is good), I'm not sure I see the point of another exchange. I'm not griping of course, nor am I pegging you down. I'm glad we're getting more options up here, and it looks like a clean build, congrats. It's just trades will then be spread across 3 exchanges in Canada, watering down trade options for Canadians between them, since we can't be expected to throw real money into every single exchange to cover the spread, and transferring dollar balances between exchanges isn't currently a clean option or without double-dinging us with fees.
What we *really* need up here is some Canadian trader consolidation into a unified exchange, like a Gox of Canada (only not awful), but I know that's not your issue or concern at all.
**But**, supporting other cryptocurrencies before VirtEx and LbertyBit finally do is a big deal, since a lot of us aren't comfortable with BTC-e. Anyway sorry if any of this comes off insulting or offensive, I support you whole-heartedly.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:41:42
That said, though, I have a lot of faith, not just in Bitcoin but crypto-forex in general. We'll see steady growth if we can avoid any damning reception from the powers that be, but to pin a value to it today may be silly (and somewhat dangerous with adding to panic movement, which causes bubbles). There are a plethora of reasons why crypto-currencies will or will not become a success.
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:16:36
This is a great explanation, thank you. Everyone here is actually shedding a lot of insight for me.

How does this make it easier to see similar inclusion for other crypto-currencies?
@_date: 2013-09-06 22:45:05
Yep, and neither do traders/investors. Other cryptocurrencies will always exist and fluctuate in tandem with each other as long as speculative trading is viable among them, and it is.

Seong, could you _please_ (please) add a secondary-level login/transaction protection? Either like how BTC-e does with an email confirmation request before transactions are completed, or a Google Authenticator secondary verification on login like LibertyBit offers?

People will think they then need to get in on the 'ground floor', but honestly I don't expect much movement from this. The previous bubble happened with no real recollection of a bubble previously (even though there was one). Traders will be a little more weary moving forward.

As a professional analyst, never [ever] use top-level, historical extrapolation as a sole trend identifier. You'll lose your hat every time, this is why auto-traders don't work.
Had you made this same extrapolation just 22 days ago, when it was at $250, you would've guessed 1 BTC = $1B USD right now.

After the big bubble there's been a lot of resistance sub-$100. Whenever it dips below that it recovers quickly.

I'd argue otherwise, but I'd also argue that the narcotics trade as a business is criminal by law more than by moral. While the facilitation of money laundering for the purpose of extortion, arms sales, the flesh trade, etc. are very much moral quandaries that one doesn't want to associate with.
Not that tax sheltering is necessarily a moral pitfall, but this is all unrequested philosophy. It boils down to: if you want your business to succeed, and be accepted, or even allowed to exist, you don't want to bring your loud-mouthed anti-establishment associate to the press meetings.
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:39:05
He should also realize an attack on Gox means the prices will fall on other exchanges, too, since everyone speculates off Gox, and not on their local exchange. Whoever's biggest dictates market movement for all exchanges.

No worries. Sometimes you just need to be a little pushy. Calling LibertyBit right after you make a deposit will speed things along, but I can't suggest it because they're a small company and swamped as it is.

While that's true, the threat of Bitcoins dropping to $0 is in the hands of those who'd rather make $138k than $0. Big cliffs aren't caused by long-term holders/casual spenders, they're the product of panic sellers who don't have a lot of faith in Bitcoin to begin with.
If he has faith, like he claims he does, there should be no real fear. That's of course assuming the majority of investors aren't trading on a hair trigger, and in it for the haul as well.

It's difficult to impossible to completely deflect DDoS attacks, so maybe 'withstand' isn't the best approach here. Gox, and exchanges in general, need to come to a reasonable method of making DDoS attacks non-profitable post attack. Perhaps with halting trades to let everyone cool off, or limiting trade sizes for a set amount of time post-attack. But that's possibly not the way to go, and to have all major exchanges agree to that sort of response would be tremendously difficult, as exchanges are technically competing against each other for business, and they make money off trades, good or bad.
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:55:36
I'm positive about BTC's long-term growth, so I'm hopeful you're right, but let's be honest, there's a lot of money to be gained on shorting, and it is a valid way of trading. So while the these last few DDoSes don't seem to be creating the same bubble burst as 'the big one', which is good for long-term investors, and may convince DDoSers it's not worth it anymore, it's still a way to make a quick buck off small, quick trades.
And as long as traders know they can make a quick buck off the, albeit small drop in value post-DDoS, they'll continue to happen. It's not a 'panic' anymore, it's market manipulation and taken advantage of by shorting day traders.
