What you are really saying is you want to give away a few bucks in hopes it will attract Unique users to your app.  
It is not hard to give away crypto.  It is hard to find users of an app in a saturated market.  Everyone and their dog is making a crypto app.  
Suck it up and pay for marketing.  $3650 can be better spent.

Bitcoin is not like stocks and anyone who thinks the potential for unlimited growth upward is real is extremely naive.  
You can make money on the swing but the days of buying now and holding for a large profit are over for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-12 12:57:19
Are you joking?  I understand Bitcoin it seems better than you and I have watched many of his videos and read much of his work AND I still have this opinion.  
How much Dark money in USD do you think exists?  The mexican cartels do not take Bitcoin and neither do Government Super Pacs for political donations.  If Fiat were to fail where would all this dark money go?  
Too many people have too much to lose from USD failing and the only reason they would invest in BTC now is to play the swing and make more Fiat plain and simple.
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:39:36

And if Governments Ban all digital assets and only allow government backed crypto?  It would not be hard for them to set up a private ledger that only they have access too and then what?  What makes you think they are not working on this already?  Digital Currency is the future for sure but it is definitely not Bitcoin.

Besides its as easy as registering a domain and service content from a certain group of servers.  Not that hard or cost prohibitive...

@_date: 2018-07-16 14:27:16
I was wrong here...  Not reducing the actual seed sorry.  And tuliptrading is right about Passphrases HOWEVER... I do store my seeds physically and digitally.  Here is my process.  I Encrypt the seed with PGP and a 6 Word passphrase (you can also use your private key) I then encode the PGP encrypted seed into a QR code which I store physically and digitally. To reverse you scan the QR code and unencrypt the PGP encrypted seed.
@_date: 2018-07-18 01:26:13
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:29:59
And how is what your saying not anecdotal?  You have no clue how most addicts start you don't know them right?  So I guess not even anecdotal you are just spouting off with nothing behind it?  I provide a study that you just disregard because "addicts said so".  It seems you only know who to debate in bad faith.
@_date: 2018-07-29 23:06:33
Its pretty easy actually.  There are apps that allow you to install a full linux distro on your android device.  The app you use will vary depending on the device though.
Personally I use a Magisk Module (Magisk is the go to root method on most devices now) that installs Kali Nethunter which uses chroot to create a full Kali Linux Distro. 
After you have the linux distro its as easy as compiling the wallets from source.  
Obviously you wont have storage space to run a full daemon/node for all the wallets but smaller coins with smaller blockchains are doable (This is why I use remote nodes).
You could use this for cold storage if you just create the wallets on the device grab the address and turn it off.
If you need more info let me know I can help you out.
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:17:42
Just give me a Smartphone with a Full Linux environment by default (You can already do this on android with root and chroot).
I already run the cli linux wallets for a bunch of coins on my phone connecting to remote nodes I run.

Not worried about addicts at all that's the whole point. I'm not a user (aside from a plant that is legal come October where I live), but have family who have battled with opiate addiction and Also have lost friends.  Every.Single.One. started with a script thier DR gave and then kept filling after issues arrived.  But it's never the Dr's fault right?

@_date: 2018-07-31 13:21:37
Fuck you man.  Most addicts start from a prescription from a Dr they trust and just feeds them full of opiates cause the asshole doesn't really give a shit about you and just wants to see the next patient.

This is a bullshit statement. One could argue that buying from a street dealer you have known for a long time would be safer from some random you never met on a DNM.  
Nice try though.
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:31:10
You can use PGP with just a Passphrase without a Private key.  But I agree for sure and yeah definite pros and cons. No real reason I chose PGP aside that I can decrypt it on my android device after I scan the QR code using the FOSS barcode scanner app and openkeychian.  I figure I can print the qr codes and store them anywhere and then just come with a single handheld device and have immediate access to the seed and funds.
