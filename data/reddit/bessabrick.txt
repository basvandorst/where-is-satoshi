Do more research about what ?
You post a link to volume charts, ok cool, so I guess your pointing towards what ? btcnCNY ? 
I'm not even going to consider doing anything with btcnCNY.
I'm an Australian, just in case you missed that. An Australian exchange would be the point I was making about someone with financial balls actioning something for the Australian market let alone the rest of us, how many of you feel uncomfortable handing out personal ID to overseas companies that, honestly cant even be bothered answering a support ticket. 
The news and internet are putting mtGox in the limelight, everyone thinks that mtgox is the shiz, so all of the new guys head straight to it.
Its miss leading and its not good for the coins if people cant even get in the door so to speak. we want more people involved, but we want them to go away and tell there friends that this was a good experience. I hope you understand what I'm trying to say here.
Thanks for your reply either way :)

* "Alternatively, you can try an alternative "lite" client such as Multibit or a super-light client like electrum, though these clients have somewhat weaker security, are less mature, and don't contribute to the health of the P2P network." 
as it states in the FAQ, and i kind of dont feel confident that these lite versions would have a solid long term survivability, im not bitching or being negative there doesn't seem to be any long term vision or direction, it seems a lot of lets see how it goes kind of thing.

thanks for your reply ryanzhoutong,
I, as I'm sure most look forward to the new verification methods.
 
The current initial verification delay time from my perspective of any of the bitcoin exchangers or converters is something that would make a newbie rethink the idea of bitcoins, it encourages the idea of distrust especially to someone new to it all. This is something that should have been identified a long time ago and placed high in the priority list of initial project development issues to solve.
can you imagine if it were, your company would stand out well beyond the others and your client's word of mouth alone would sell the product based on that fast id check and confidence in knowing that you guys have it together over your competition, this alone encourages and builds trust.
I would imagine anything that improves the fluent access, increasing the spread of bitcoin use to the masses would be a major goal of the bitcoin currency. 
As for the NAB, its great that you can use these banking methods, I'm all set up and ready to go, but it is only useful AFTER verification, in the meantime I have to sit and wait reading more about bitcoins and watch the others trade stocks ;P
I appreciate your reply however, this alone makes me feel a little better knowing that someone human IS watching from your company and cares enough to at least respond.
thanks again for your time,
Brick
