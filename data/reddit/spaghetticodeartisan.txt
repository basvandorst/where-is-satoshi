So does plastic.


Yes, but currently some 10% of gold production is used in electronics, suggesting its real practical value is _much_ lower. Also, I've read reports that gold is overused in electronics and in part could be replaced by alternatives.


Yeah, it pretty much boils down to this... But you know, times change.

That's an incredibly stupid article. Half of it is telling us that gasses and radioactive stuff aren't suitable as a currency. No shit. It's hard to get more obvious than that. The rest of it deals with how other metals were impractical in the centuries long gone, which is relevant today how? It's not.
Most importantly, though, the entire premise of the article is completely off. Essentialy they assume that once you rule out the elements that are not suitable, the winner(s) somehow must be suitable, because that's the only thing left. There's no reason for that though. The reality may very well be that _no_ periodic table element is a good currency. Afterall, how is gold really different from any other currency? It' not. Only about 10% of it is used for some actual practical prupose (such as electronics) and even in those departments it's usually not the only option.
Let's face it, gold is just a shiny yellow thingy. The only difference between gold and paper with symbolic value is that gold has the longest trandition of having symbolic value. That's it.
