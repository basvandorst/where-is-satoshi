Can't you do that with a simple log file?
@_date: 2014-06-25 00:02:13
This is where I got lost too

Only thing I havn't wrapped my head around yet is why is swarm necessary if counterparty has dividend pay outs?
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:13:55
Get out.

Are messages not verified untill they are packed into a block?
And what is the overall purpose of having blocks?

Thanks, that analogy makes sense.  So the locking/unlocking makes sense.  When would one sign a transaction with a private key?
@_date: 2012-12-12 23:27:06
Aw I see, without blocks if could take the decentralized system a long time to decide which of your two transactions to accept as the real one.  With blocks we know a transaction is picked within about 5 min or so.  (I hope this is correct reasoning at least!)  What happens if two different blocks are found simultaneously on the network?
Thanks for all the help man

I like the analogy, and finding the right "bow" makes sense.  I guess what I am still confused on is why can't clients just compare the entire transaction history with each other to keep the official record?

Oh smart.  I think I am starting to like this bitcoin thing.

I was under the impression that transactional security is only dependent on the number of blocks, not time.  So you would not need 60 confirmations, the same 6 will do.  But the overhead is a good point.

already new RES tag, sorry bro.

I don't like the dotted lines between links, other then that it looks great. Nice work!

This was my best stop when backpacking through, gotta do it.

I'm not positive, but I think a large part of the apple system is automated.  So it might just require a closer look from them to remove it.
@_date: 2013-10-23 03:21:04
This is awesome, but isn't apple going to attack it?
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:42:57
I personally like no lines.  It looks clean and I don't have trouble separating links.
