I edited to 300k but I disagree that a kid makes 100k starting off.  They are lucky to break 70k out of college.

lol, the new dankmemes format.  Too bad I got banned for posting [B] memes.
Yeah, I bough at 8k dip.  I thought about selling at 11.5k, I literally had my finger on the button.
I regretted it until I realized by the time I sold it, got the funds, it would be back to 11.5k plus.

I think Bitcoin has a chance to go back up to 15k+ by one-two months, but I see your point.

Good for me though, I bought back a .5 at 8k, just made 1k doing nothing.  I'm going to wager my end of next month it will be back at 15k+.

Joseph Smith, who started out as a gold digger (literally), claimed he had a vision that angels told him Jesus visited Native Americans.  He wrote a new testament transcribed from plates written in a language he claimed only he could read.  From Wikipedia:




Smith was later tarred and feather.  He tried to marry the wives of his associates.  A mob stormed the jail he was at, he fell threw a window crying, "Oh Lord my God!" and was shot several more times.
By all accounts he was a fraud and huckster claiming his Bible to be the one true word of god.

You just need to wait.  You're right.  Pretend it's not there.  I'm assuming you invested about 100k+.  Well, just don't think about it.  There are guys on this sub that sold a few thousand of bitcoin back when it was $.80 now worth millions.  Just pretend it's not there, check back about 6 months.  And reevaluate.

I've been on r/bitcoin , ending in dirty downvotes
List'ning to the weakhands, thinking 'bout this 'n' that
They said, "its Soros, its the stock market, its FUD, look at this projection, Bart Simpson, this and that."
Turn it down a little bit or turn it down flat
Pump it up, when you don't really need it
Pump it up, until you can feel it
Down in the pleasure center, hell-bent or heaven-sent
Listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander
There's nothing underhand that weakhands wouldn't understand
Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it
Bitcoin been a bad dip, like a chemical
Though you try to stop it, Bitxoin like a narcotic

I signed up on GDAX yesterday and transferred my coinbase funds because I wanted to set up stop-loss without having to check every 5 minutes.  First half an hour spent trying to figure out why the Fuck it was only selling bitcoin for vergcoin.  Then I remembered a post on this sub about how bitrash was the default for GDAX.  I clicked on the menu top left and changed it to BTC/USD.
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:09:52
