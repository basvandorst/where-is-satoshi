Loaning out a deflationary currency doesn't work. It's not an option.

Fair enough. There's realistically no other way to do it I'm afraid. 
An insurance company that will pay out bitcoins would have to exist. That's literally the only way you could do a bitcoin payout on a bitcoin loss.
Nothing like that exists. The next best solution is a fiat payout which is very possible and what I'm proposing. 
Edit: That sentence probably should be:


But I think that would confuse people. They might think we're guaranteeing that the value of their bitcoins won't go down.

No worries.

Of course. The fee scheme will be per BTC. You transfer 1000 more BTC into your account and you'll be paying 1000x more fees. 
Anyway, it wouldn't be our promise. It would be the promise of the insurance underwriter we pay and keep happy (Regular security audits, etc).

If we ran away there'd be 50 employees wondering what the hell just happened. We're an established company, not a new start up. We've been in the industry 20 years. Running away with bitcoins isn't an attractive option for us. It'd also mean running from the law as well as destroying our current business which is doing very well.

The insurance would be an agreed upon amount per $1 worth of bitcoin stored. Something like $0.005 per $1. 
Since the fee is in BTC then the fee will scale correctly depending on the value of the coins. 
If 1BTC is $1000 and the person was paying 0.005 BTC to insure it then they'd be paying $5 for $1000 of insurance. That's equal to $0.005 per $1.
The survey is saying that the vast majority of people would only pay 50 cents a month per $1000 worth of insurance. 
It looks like this plan is dead in the water. It might be a case of wanting too much for too little.

$50,000 worth of insurance for $50 a year is way less than we'd ever be able to agree with an insurer. That's nearer the *monthly* fee to be honest. If you multiplied it by 5.

It's doable.

It's uncertain right now as we need to speak with insurers but I find it very unlikely that they'd pay out in such an event purely because it's so unlikely to happen. 
They'd also need access to your email account. 
Upon either the changing of your email address or the transfer of funds an email would be sent to your registered email address with a one time link embedded in it. If clicked within the 24 hour window, this would cancel the transfer and/or email change. No log in needed. 
So the thief would need to steal the post-it with your email username and password on it, steal the post-it with your vault account username and password on it, steal your phone and steal your hardware token. 
They'd also need to stop you from finding out that all of that stuff had been stolen for 24 hours. 
It seems so unlikely that anyone claiming it had happened would likely just be attempting insurance fraud. 
It's completely possible that we could implement an optional third, second factor of authentication. One time password sent by snail mail. I'd like to see a thief attempt to steal a house! 
Obviously the lead time on transferring funds would increase dramatically if that was enabled.

Absolutely correct. There would be some extremely stringent auditing requirements from the insurance companies to ever make this a viable business.

Not yet established. It will be a big name underwriter. For the sake of the survey lets say Lloyds of London. 


100% of deposits. 


If there is a failure of our security which results in your bitcoins being stolen (We are hacked, broken into, etc) the insurance will pay out.


Your countries fiat using the exchange rate at the time of theft.

Insurance costs money. No one will be doing this for free, I'm afraid. Somewhere along the line you'll be charged for it. The cost might be hidden to you in some future case, but it'll still be there.

It's per bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:45:44


It's not. 


No interest is gained. This is a vault service. It's job is to keep your bitcoins safe, and if it fails at that the insurance company will pay you the value of your bitcoins. It's akin to a vault storing gold. You don't get more gold for storing your gold in a banks vault. 


We secure bitcoins, not fiat ;)

That's what we're talking about. From my original post:
