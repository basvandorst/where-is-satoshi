Charlie Lee said on twitter 2 days ago that they're going to reduce the fees with the next update.

He doesn't have a billion dollars, it's a billion in danish kroner, which is a lot less than a billion in dollar (still much money though of course).  
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:04:41
Well yeah, but it's a billion bitcoin in danish kroner. There's been people cashing out $100-200 million probably several times before so I don't think you're right on your second statement.

Something, something John McAfee.

What the fuck is CHUP, and why are you repeating it?
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:52:53
Why are the knife running?

Fuck, easy to understand, off, real easy to understand. FUCK OFF @_date: 2015-01-16 17:31:43
Wow, you have almost 2 days of fighting bitcoin now, you must be so proud of yourself. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 03:08:18
They have to rewrite all of it if this is new information for them, which it probably is.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:02:50
You're trying to catch a falling knife, not chasing a runaway-knife.

They've said on bitcointalk that we'll get more than 55%. 100% is showing right now.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:30:57
They've held my money for over a month now, so if I get it back, why shouldn't I trust them? I don't think new customers is on their minds right now...
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:31:29
And what are they called?
@_date: 2015-08-28 14:14:41
His favorite. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:56:42
Reddit doesn't seem to like them.
@_date: 2015-07-25 08:22:58


@_date: 2019-01-28 14:44:31
Yes, and if Bitcoin was new that would also be noteworthy, but it's not.

Did you hear about  Burger King opening up a new restaurant in Sheboygan? They made their first burger to cash transaction the same day.

Some people have so easy to complain just because they didn't double their money the last month. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:25:17
I think most of them are celebrating the (potential) end of the bear market, not the 15% gain. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:59:34
Sounds like you're complaining about the price, when it's still higher than what it was 3 months ago. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:44:34
@_date: 2015-11-11 23:51:50
How much do you want to know it?
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:03:37
They're polish, not russian. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:08:25
Doesn't work right now, but I don't care if they're watching, as long as I get my funds back. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:22:01


The least you could do is look up their twitter before you start complaining about them not explaining themselves. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:45:53
No it's all fine, they'll be up in a few days. Just some unexpected maintenance.

As long as he wasn't the owner of BTC-E, there's still hope.
