what country?

There's no fee to move bitcoin to another wallet there. Check the amount of BITCOIN that was transferred. The USD-BTC value fluctuates in this market a lot.

So you werent invited. Why would you expect password reset to work if you never got an invite?

You're very accusatory. At the end of the day, the following occurred:
1. Coinbase fucked up.
2. OP should have left the coins in his/her account.
3. Coinbase support didn't respond to a 5-figure (USD) fuckup on their part.
4. Coinbase abused their knowledge of OPs bank account information to try and fix their mistake.
Seems downright shady to me.
End of story.

This is amazing

Looks like they say "checkout" so maybe it's only for NFC POS services like, the BitPay app?

Agreed- it'd be nice to only sign in via oauth instead of giving them my username+password

The test bitcoin network is not reliable (often down, hacked, etc). Altcoins can also provide a way to test different ways of doing things entirely.

I keep hearing horror stories from this company - mainly that preorders took so long to fulfill while difficulty skyrocketed.
Now crappy hardware too??

Coinbase has recurring buys. That's probably the closest you can get with little friction

It depends on where you think  Bitcoin will go. Many people here think Bitcoin will change the entire financial industry (read: $$$$) - but that's a long term view (in other words, it could go down a LOT before going up). 
If you agree, Bitcoin at $1000 might be cheap.  But again, you need to be ready for some wild swings in the short term.
Also, don't invest what you aren't willing to lose.

Maybe. And no.
Price is set by supply and demand. No real maximum value. No real way of determining future price.
Only thing we know is that the minimum value is 0.

Exciting.... as long as they don't china us.

Bitcoin family: reality show following a family who ONLY operates in bitcoin- converting to fiat only when they MUST (eg utility bills)

I'm not so sure I trust CoinJar. Co-founder Zhou Tong was behind Bitcoinica.
Fool me once...

I dont want to take anything away from you saying this for months, but this has been a major, if not THE MOST major, concern of Bitcoin since the beginning. At least for some of us.
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:51:55
How much was this for?
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:24:20
Skip the money part, Bitcoin is built upon a concept that was created to prevent spam. It's called [Hashcash](
Basically it'd require every email sender to solve a computationally-intensive problem before sending the email to each recipient. For regular email, the time to do this would be unnoticeable. But for spammers (with tons of recipients), it'd take a long time and a lot of computing power to send out mail... Thus making it less profitable to send spam.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:11:54
They did 6 in a row in the past, too.
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:12:43
Right now it absolutely is mostly speculation. It's a guess of the future value- like any other investment. 
Bitcoin happens to have a lot of buzz with very little real world application AT THE MOMENT. We'll see soon.
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:37:40
Gotta hear this story... What happened?
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:39:51
Blockchain.info is not the actual blockchain. It is just a website showing showing blockchain data.
Also: bitcoins stored on a paper wallet still exist in the blockchain. Paper wallet just means storing your access keys on paper, not the actual coin.
