A Trump supporter who wants to create fake IDs and use PO boxes for narcotics trafficking?

The idea that Trump only has what his father gave him is a myth, created and spread by the Clinton campaign to attack what they saw as one of Trump's biggest strengths (business success).
Try researching it for yourself instead of just swallowing everything Clinton and the MSM tried to spoon feed you.

You raise some interesting points and yet still fail to set forth a better way.
Of course, "better regulations" is silly, and "better law makers" sets forth a noble ideal but fails to provide any realistic path forward. We currently have shitty regulations and shitty law makers. Of course we'd all like to do better in both of those areas, but how?
And in the meantime, what can we do to stop hindering the growth and expansion of small and medium sized businesses in our country?

How would you propose simplifying existing regulations and also discouraging the proliferation of new ones?

You make some good points. I can definitely see where your coming from.
I do think that one tiny source of hope is the movement to limit Congressional term limits. I think that would go a long way towards reducing corruption, especially in tandem with the proposed lobbying ban for government officials. Neither is a panacea, of course.
