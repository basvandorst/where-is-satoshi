So just because enough economist believe this it’s untrue?
Here is some direct evidence that a slight positive inflation rate is good.
Galloping inflation occurred during the 1980s. It prompted President Ronald Reagan to famously say, "Inflation is as violent as a mugger, as frightening as an armed robber, and as deadly as a hit man."  It took double-digit interest rates and a recession to stop galloping inflation. Thankfully, it hasn’t returned since then. The worst types of inflation are hyperinflation and stagflation.
The housing industry provides an example of both inflation and deflation. Until 2006, gradually rising prices attracted investors. They saw there was a chance to make money by buying now and selling later. This created more jobs as home builders tried to meet demand.
But between 2006 and 2010, the housing market experienced massive deflation. Prices fell 30 percent. Those who could afford to buy a house decided to wait until the market improved. The longer they waited, the lower prices dropped. 
Many people were trapped in their homes. They could not sell their homes for enough to cover the mortgages. They became upside-down. Eventually, they could not see any light at the end of the tunnel. Even those who could afford to keep paying, often just walked away. This sent prices even lower.

A small amount of inflation is necessary for a healthy economy because it incentivizes people to invest their money now because to not do so would devalue their money in the future. ... When inflation is too high it becomes difficult to receive a return on your investment higher than the inflation, which is not good
