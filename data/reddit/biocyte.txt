I'm so glad to be a part of this, the revolution, the change of our lifes, bitcoiiiiinnnnnn, say it with me, BITCOOOOOIIINNN, I'm so happy, my wife was pissed and then I went to bank and put 100$ on the table and she was like "oh".

It's not worth doing threads like this, you'll just get downvoted, sadly.
People need to experience it to learn, words are no use.
Just realize that you don't go to a new ATH 2 days after a 40% correction. It's just not feasible. Look at the volume. Don't get caught in the bulltrap. There needs to be price consolidation first. Every previous major correction has lasted much longer than this
Anyways, happy New Year! Good luck in your investments.

@_date: 2017-12-30 15:22:13
Not even a pentium would lagg and freeze like this. GDAX has been absolute shit lately, what a disgrace
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:52:14
Yep. I Sold everything yesterday, fuck it. Until there's scaling solutions implemented, it's a worthless asset.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:59:08
It's the end of the year. Christmas is here. Of course people are going to take profits, specially since bitcoin has only been above 10k$ for 14 days (that's nothing, imagine everyone who bought before that selling right now...yeah).

Lol bitcoin cash is an altcoin bro, this sub is for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:38:57
lol easy there spider man
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:54:47
I agree. Though I think we're going through a dead cat bounce right now and will go even lower.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:07:03
We'll see 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:51:04
34$ is the average right now
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:15:45
yeah people seem to comment copy pasta like that shit comment, all the time. Tbh it's starting to sound ridiculous.
"if you believe hodl, if not, don't" 
"thank you for selling your cheap coins!"
hodling this, hodling that...
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:14:59
I'd say correction is deffinitely not over yet. You don't just crash dip from 18k$ to 10k$ in 2 days and go straight up to new ATH lol, not feasible. There needs to be consolidation, and market needs to settle on support levels first, that takes time.
There's a lot of bull traps right now so be careful. I think we might go back and re-test the 10-8k$ levels.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:29:34
I have a market sell pending a well. Once all the sell orders start going through, my guess is we're fucked. Like what happened when btc-eur dipped to 8300 euros few days ago. FUCK GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:30:39
I don't see it breaking 20k anytime soon. Specially not before the end of the year. As for next year, maybe.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:50:03
It's not over yet...It'll crash again
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:52:13
this isn't youtube
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:06:55
this is cheap lol? check back in a week
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:19:21
Same, for 2 hours now. Motherfuckers

[December 2013 vs December 2017](
Because every Investor will try to redeem their profits, before the close of each year. Check previous years and you'll see this is normal.
I'll buy back in in beggining of 2018. Till then, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:02:55
"I came here just because of comments" is the type of shit you see in youtube comment section.
Of course we're here for the comments, what does saying it explicitly contribute to anything though?
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:19:58
It can't
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:59:14
14k$ is pretty damn high for bitcoin. We've only been above 10k$ for 2 weeks. I'm actually surprised it lasted this long and went as far as 20k.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:52:49
Same, I won't be using GDAX anymore after this one. It has happened too many times for this to be acceptable.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:50:37
do you even paragraph bro?
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:52:23
I wonder what news will trigger the next stage
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:47:32
Oh yeah. Go ahead and buy :D
We're deffinitely  ^' Back to normal ^'

I'm out for now, but I'll be watching the charts and the bloodshed. Crypto is fun
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:16:29
Might as well send the private keys via registered mail, should arrive faster and it's cheaper than sending bitcoin for the same tx fee. Ridiculous
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:09:15
Where the price goes lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:19:01
I ain't going to buy any bitcoin until this whole high fee bullshit is fixed, what a disgrace
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:09:14
No it doesn't worth it what?
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:40:08

Visit a doctor why? It's time we lose those preconceived notions that some drugs are bad and other drugs are good. 
Psychadelics are generally VERY safe, (referring to magic mushrooms and LSD here), in no way shape or form can you die from taking regular recreational dosages. 
People have taken up to 2000x the recreational dose and not died. Hell, the lethal dose hasn't even been determined yet. Now you look at alcohol where the lethal dose is so low and damage accumulates in your liver and brain with chronic abuse, yet it is as legal as water and for many, it isn't even considered a drug.
Psychedelics are safer than aspirin. Even for (moderate) long term use, there are no side effects (unless you're genetically predisposed to have schizophrenia, in which case it will just speed up the appearance of the disease, but it will appear sooner than later regardless).
As a side note, take some time to research psychadelics and try LSD. There's a big chance that it will change your life for the better :)

What are you talking about? Psychotic breaks are very common even among people who have never taken any drug in their life.
Having a psychotic episode does not cause permanent damage. That is absolute nonsense. 
1 in 13 people will experience at least a psychotic episode in their lives.
Psychotic experiences are associated with an elevated risk of later mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, and others. Drugs are not the problem. Ignorance is.
Backing up my statments with the following studies:
1)McGrath JJ, et al. 2016. Age of Onset and Lifetime Projected Risk of Psychotic Experiences: Cross-National Data from the World Mental Health Survey. Schizophrenia Bulletin.
2)McGrath JJ, et al. 2016 The Bidirectional Associations Between Psychotic Experiences and DSM-IV Mental Disorders. American Journal of Psychiatry. (AJP in Advance)

Forks have always been part of bitcoin. It has had forks before, issues arise and have to be dealt with. Forks help us improve the technology and let the community decide upon what the majority supports.
