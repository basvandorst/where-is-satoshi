This guy missed the tech boom and has a flip phone, what did you expect?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:19:54
You need accepting bussinesses for that
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:09:06
Which future potential? Steam actually stopped using bitcoin as a payment because of the high fees. Adoption is going backwards and the transactions are clogged. 
Downvote me all you want. Bitcoin is WAY overvalued at the moment and people are only buying out of massive greed and fear of missing out.

What makes you think the price is not being manipulated before the release of wall street futures?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:36:22
What use case is bitcoin when you can't do anything with it except for holding?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:41:39
They invested 11 million in bitcoin in 2013. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:59:33


Same as the blockchain is not a bubble, but bitcoin definitly is.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:24:29
In 18 months? lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:13:07
Adoption by whom? Have you read my comment?
@_date: 2018-10-13 10:21:29
It will get worse before it gets better. No guarantee the support will hold.
@_date: 2018-06-09 11:41:45
That sub is literally cancer
@_date: 2018-06-02 01:59:44
Explain Venezuela, zimbabwe and recently the turkish lira
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:19:43
We get it, but it’s not funny
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:04:18
Seems legit
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:24:01
Somebody got triggered
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:59:39
How does such society account for human characteristics like jealousy, greed and things like status and ego?
@_date: 2018-06-09 11:12:35
How can resources ever be free? Nothing in life is free. Wether is costs money, time, effort or anything else of value. Explain this to me.
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:59:35
Money =\= marketcap
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:38:23
It does not work that way bro. People are not going to give you money and hope you will do the lottery, just because you have done it before.
@_date: 2018-06-09 11:14:38
Risk to people, profit to themselves
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:15:12
You actually lose money if you are saving it in the bank, due to higher inflation than the low interest rates.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:26:12
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:41:12
Lol no
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:28:25
Taxation is theft
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:21:07
Why is this retarded advice given so much? Of course it matters, because buying at the right time will give you more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:34:03
If only it would be spent well, it wouldn't be theft
@_date: 2018-11-04 14:18:39


So, you actually owe money to your portfolio. Bear markets are hard man.
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:06:35
Did none of your closest people got hurt by the financial crisis bitcoin was born out of?
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:03:45
Why are you here? 
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:15:33
Are you high?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:18:28
They got chickenburgers bro
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:30:26
No, I just forked it to Poopycoin cash ABC - which is the real poopycoin
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:18:52
I have a million poopycoins, u buy one from me for 2 dollars. I now have 2 million dollars in market cap.
I buy the poopycoin back for 1 dollar. Oh no, a million $ value has lost! That deleted money could have helped us all!
@_date: 2018-11-22 11:14:47
You forgot that bitcoin halving is in 2020
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:04:34


@_date: 2018-11-30 19:37:18
This holds so much weight
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:13:29
r/buttcoin is over there
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:08:38
Holy fuck bro get a life. You are obsessing. Salty you missed the boat?
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:05:19
We don't agree to taxes, we are being forced to pay it. And it's up to the government who extorts our money, to dictate how much we need to pay and how they will spend it (protip: horribly).
The concept of taxes is great, but the use of it is flawed.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:14:12
How many times has bitcoin been banned already lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:38:35
retard gambling addict
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:13:21
In the future when you do anything, do the opposite
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:17:03
Please go to r/buttcoin pussy

THE CHARTS TALK TO ME
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:21:33
This is true. They don't trust it at the moment. But FOMO will reek them in anyway.
@_date: 2018-04-13 10:40:11

@_date: 2017-07-29 17:45:43
It's not like it was worth that much when it was being stored
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:55:07
