There are roughly two options:
1. Encourage and support people's incompetence, by continuing to provide ways for people to "use" things (or perceive to) and acting as their nanny in the process. They will stay incompetent forever; there is no obvious incentive for them to change that, because "it works already".
2. Help people become competent and learn (and gain perspective in the process), and have them carry a reasonable responsibility over their own actions (and, in this case, property). They will become competent over time, as 99% of the people are not inherently incapable of backing up a file on a HDD, to put it bluntly.
I'd say that option 2 is a vastly better option than the first one, which could be paraphrased as "keeping people dumb".

1. The CC0 involves legalese, the WTFPL does not - legalese and other nonsense is exactly what I'm trying to avoid.
2. Many major projects and organizations (including those with legal teams) consider the WTFPL a valid license; see also  ("Is the WTFPL a valid license?")
3. I have yet to see a concrete problem pointed out with the validity of the WTFPL. I frequently run across vague meaningless and parroted statements like *"yeah well, it might not be valid in all jurisdictions"*, but nobody appears to have a source for this - and despite quite a lot of searching around, I've found exactly 0 reliable evidence or analysis of this.
If you know of a concrete way in which the WTFPL might be invalidated, I'd love to hear it. Otherwise, I'm going with the same response as always: "I'm pretty sure that's not the case".

I'd say Satoshi's claimed intentions are [pretty well-documented]( While there is no way to be 100% sure he isn't lying (like for just about everything else in the world), the design of Bitcoin completely matches that intention, and does not support the alternative popular theory that Satoshi was just looking to "cash in".

Right, that basically sounds like reinventing SQRL to me.
@_date: 2014-06-04 00:17:02
Not necessarily. If there are stacked algorithms, then that means that the total hashing power of commodity hardware is also lower (after all, more work has to be done). That means that, as an ASIC user, you also have a lower network hashrate to compete with for the same (relative) pay-off - and slower ASICs are still cheaper than faster ones.
If anything, this might actually make the divide between ASIC and non-ASIC mining *worse*. Determining that with certainty would require a closer look at the algorithms used (and in particular how these relate to commodity hardware instruction sets), but it's not inconceivable that the stacked algorithms just open up more optimalization vectors for ASICs.
@_date: 2014-08-13 10:27:00

Yes, but keep in mind this very important thing: **Electrum *cannot* regenerate the keys for imported keys from your seed.**
What this means in practice is that the 'seed' you were given when creating your wallet, *will not be able to recover any funds in your old addresses*. Addresses that are created newly by Electrum itself are not affected by this.
Either way, I recommend 'sweeping' your old addresses into new (Electrum-generated) addresses. That way, if you *do* ever happen to lose your wallet, and you have your seed backed up, you minimize your losses, to anything that was sent to the old addresses *after* sweeping them.
Sweeping is not currently supported by Electrum, [here]( is a workaround.

Because people have been taught poor security practices for years by institutions that are supposedly trustable?


Bullshit. Go look at the development of KeePass, TrueCrypt, PGP, and so on. There is not some kind of mythical security-paranoid attitude that started existing with Bitcoin. It has been around for far longer than Bitcoin has even been on anybody's mind.


All of those apps do effectively the same thing. The security of (almost?) none of them has been publicly audited. If you want to come up with "convenient ways", then come up with ways that are *actually different* and not just the same concept with different branding. Trezor is an example of a different convenient way, and such solutions using keypairs have been around for a long time - what exactly do you think a [YubiKey]( is?


Which is exactly what I said, and which you conveniently left out from your quote. Classy.


This has absolutely nothing to do with BitID, nor with Bitcoin itself. It has to do with the wallet software. **Bitcoin and Bitcoin wallets are not the same thing.**


Okay, yeah, I'm sure that's why there's multiple competing pieces of PGP software with new ones surfacing every month or so, and why SQRL despite being extremely new already has a number of implementations. Clearly, the development community around cryptography other than Bitcoin is dead in the water. Right.
Please, go look outside your bubble.


Do you even understand what SQRL *is*? It's a protocol, not an 'app'. Just like BitID. Which doesn't have anything to do with Bitcoin other than that it reuses Bitcoin keypairs - *which, by the way, is a fucking awful idea from a cryptography and security point of view*. Implementing one or the other doesn't make a difference in terms of what time is spent on.


Uhm, no, they wouldn't? What exactly makes you think that a "whole separate key management system" is needed to store a different kind of keypair? This just makes no sense.


Except it wouldn't be. Cryptographical functions are provided by third-party libraries and can thus be implemented easily. *If you're using homegrown crypto, your security is already going to be broken.*
I'm going to be honest here, and say that I don't think *you have even the faintest clue of what you're talking about*, and you're really not qualified to argue on this topic. You keep implying some kind of inherent connection between BitID and Bitcoin, and *no such connection exists*, it's that simple. You also - for reasons that are beyond me - keep insisting that SQRL somehow uses PGP, *which it doesn't*.
**BitID is NOT a Bitcoin protocol extension. It is NOT a Bitcoin transaction. It does NOT have anything to do with Bitcoin, other than that _it reuses your fucking keypairs_.**

No, it's not. Anarchy is absence of enforced government, not enforced absence of government. There is no reason why government cannot exist in an anarchist framework, as long as it's genuinely and truly voluntary (thus, not tied to eg. permission to be on a plot of land). If you do not wish to associate, that should be your choice. If you *do* wish to associate, that should equally be your choice.


I think you're confusing anarchy and "kicking against the establishment".


You seem to be conflating a lot of things there - how are "painting a target on the back of their heads", Silk Road and an "unstable commodity" (which is a dubious claim in itself) related to each other?


Yes, I think this story is a tad too corny - however, that's unrelated to the topic of anarchy.


That is a personal decision that is up to them, and nobody but them. Just like there are valid reasons for obscuring your identity in some situations, there are valid reasons for exposing it in others. The right tool for the right job and all that.


Anarchy by default involves free speech, just not in the legal sense. If anything, this perfectly conforms with the concept of anarchy.


I can't help but observe the irony in you complaining that the word 'anarchy' is thrown around too much, only to then proceed to do the exact same thing yourself.

As far as I'm aware, this is done regardless of license, and it's up to you as the billed entity to provide evidence that you have a royalty-free license.

Yes, but that's the point - if people cannot handle a fallacy being pointed out, it's never going to turn into a good debate and I'm just wasting time I don't have on constructing a logical argument that's not going to be understood.
Somebody does not even *have* to know the 'strict rules of debate' - I provided a link to a Wikipedia page that nicely explains what the problem is, and specifically stated what the specific false dichotomy was. If that is ignored and insults are thrown instead, it's not just 'not knowing the rules of debate', it's simple disinterest in making a valid point and/or disrespect for the other person.
If somebody is infuriated by somebody pointing out a flaw in their reasoning, it was never going to be a constructive debate to begin with - until that issue is overcome, it's more or less pointless to try and have a further discussion.

They effectively expose your data in plaintext form to any application that cares about it, for the duration of the mount. It's the same problem as when using 'encrypted archives' where the files are written to a temporary folder in plaintext, except here you're talking about disk volumes and not a temporary folder.
There are significantly more attack vectors that result in disk access, than there are attack vectors that result in RAM access. This is why proper encryption schemes for these kind of things (KeePass, BIP-38, etc.) only store the plaintext in RAM and never write it to disk.
EDIT: Moral of the story; if a purpose-specific encryption or security scheme is offered, always use that. You're almost certainly overlooking an edge case in the generic solution that could make your security entirely useless.

The thing is that the same security could easily be applied to *any* kind of keypair. There's no inherent limit to the amount of keypairs you can store in a secure scheme, and in fact it's good practice to reuse keys as little as possible to avoid analysis-based attacks on it - which, I presume, is why SQRL uses per-site subkeys rather than just the master key.
Hell, you could probably even just store SQRL keypairs in a Bitcoin wallet if you *really* have a valid reason for specifically wanting to store them there. That doesn't require a completely separate authentication scheme design - specifically, one that appears to have a number of weaknesses that SQRL does not.


Yes, and that lack of information concerns me. This just seems like a serious case of [Not Invented Here]( - something that's generally a bad practice in software development, but downright dangerous when it comes to cryptography/security.

[Prostitution is illegal and will be prosecuted, unless you have a permit](
Weed legislation has actually been tightening up for a few years now, with a [crackdown on transparent marijuana growing ops]( introduction of a 'weed pass' to [try and discourage foreigners from buying weed]( there has been [an incredible amount of raids and seizures]( even for 'personal growing', an increasing amount of 'coffeeshops' closing, and all that on top of the fact that weed *was never legal to begin with*, just 'tolerated'. That tolerance is rapidly shrinking, and at this point there are several US states that are more progressive in this area than the Netherlands.
BTC is also not exactly *supported* by anything related to NL government, there just happen to be a bunch of Dutch people who set up stuff (such as Bitonic). The Dutch central bank [explicitly warned against and made ignorant statements about Bitcoin](

RAM is significantly harder to access (attack-vector-wise) than on-disk things. There are a lot of attack vectors such as LFI attacks (or the workstation equivalents) that will simply only give you access to the filesystem, and won't allow for escalation to RAM access - while the other way around, RAM access would likely let you escalate to disk access. Your RAM really *is* less likely to be compromised. Additionally, it requires more skill to do so, so you're no longer low-hanging fruit.


Sure you can? If you're using BIP-38, the client will simply ask you for the password to decrypt the key, and even if you're only using KeePass (which I would not recommend for private keys for the exact same reason) a client should just give you an input field that you can paste it in, so the decrypted key never hits your disk.
As far as I am aware, all major clients currently store their wallets in encrypted format, so I'm not sure where you're seeing a problem.

This is the same fallacy that has caused an incredible amount of problems with Anonymous in the past.
Bitcoin, like Anonymous, is inherently decentralized. For people to fully understand its model and implications, they will have to learn to deal with decentralized systems. **You don't do that by giving them a half-assed centralized frontend every time.**
Centralized organizations, time after time, become powerhouses and sources of problems. Bitcoin, to be used to its full potential, will require an understanding of decentralization to begin with.

Not sure if your comment was intended as a joke or if you're missing the point, but I'll answer either way.
RealPlayer and Silverlight both have significant problems. The big problem with RealPlayer was the bundling of all kinds of rubbish with the (required) software to use it, which in turn made usage drop when better alternatives became available. Nowadays, to my knowledge, RealPlayer does not offer *any* benefits over container formats such as MKV and codecs such as h264, so there is no reason why people would suddenly start adopting it, and it simply doesn't have the momentum anymore.
The main problem with Silverlight is its incredibly poor portability. While alternative implementations theoretically exist for platforms that aren't Windows, these implementations are almost always incomplete, unstable, buggy, or otherwise not very usable. It also offered very little, if anything at all, over the already-in-wide-usage Flash. Even the latter has been seeing a decline lately (primarily towards HTML5/CSS3/JS), and there's no reason for Silverlight to gain any real adoption. It does not have any distinguishing features that aren't offered by another platform that is better in some way.
Both of these are not at all comparable to Bitcoin. Bitcoin offers a certain set of desirable features, combined into a single protocol, that are not offered by anything else (aside from derivatives of Bitcoin). That provides the reason for adoption. The part of the explanation that you're quoting, simply clarifies on why people would change their stance towards the concept over time, and why a currently negative perception of Bitcoin does not somehow spell its doom.

I don't actually have a lot of time to look through the code (I found this through three `grep -ir`s), but judging from how it's used, all input in that form will be cast to a float, and eventually back to a string. I don't know from the top of my head on what values floats cause problems, but this should give some insight: 
It's probably a bad idea for me to submit a patch - I'm not at all familiar with Django, so I'd be just as likely to break something, as I'd be to fix it. The solution *should* just consist of using strings (when passing on to RPC directly) or smallest-unit integers (for calculation), though.

While correct, this is not really much different without TOR. In fact, depending on routing, using TOR may mean that *less* entities could inspect your traffic - for example, if the route from your exit node to the destination is shorter than it would be from your own ISP.
There's anywhere between 10-30 hops from your home connection to any destination. That traffic goes past an alarming amount of potential tapping points. Whether you use TOR or not doesn't really matter - the only way to prevent this from happening, is to use encryption towards your destination such as SSL, or - in the case of eg. an IM service - end-to-end encryption such as OTR.

In the short term, no. In the long term, there's absolutely something to be afraid of. If Bitcoin were an immutable protocol, there would not really be a problem - but it isn't. It can be changed, even if not by a single entity.
Decentralization isn't a magic bullet; propaganda is its biggest enemy, because it can make an otherwise rational group of independent individuals work collectively towards something against their own interests. Note that I'm using the word 'propaganda' here according to its original meaning: manipulative information.
EDIT: To clarify, the problem I'm foreseeing is that people will adapt the protocol to fit the organizational model, rather than the other way around; that is, changing Bitcoin as a protocol to function within a centralized, regulated and obfuscated environment.

3. No single person or company controls or owns it, and nobody can decide what you can or cannot do with it. You get to choose whether you want to control your own money, or want a "bank" to do it for you.
4. It's open-source. Anybody with enough time can look at the code, and verify that it does what it promises.
5. It's an important technological breakthrough; it solves a problem that was previously considered more-or-less impossible. That's why something like Bitcoin hasn't existed before.
6. It's secure. It being based on cryptography and open-source, it doesn't have a lot of security problems that other things do have.
7. There's a fixed amount of Bitcoins. Nobody can just decide to "print more Bitcoins" at will.

Fairly sure these things as described are illegal here (the Netherlands). For context: 'having a creditcard' is not an assumed thing in the Netherlands, the dominant form of payment is 'bank cards' (which I suppose equates to a debit card tied to a bank account). While you *can* go into debt for a certain amount if it's enabled on your account, the general attitude is more towards "don't spend what you don't have" than in for example the US.

That's incorrect. Written consent is not a requirement, only a pre-existing contract/agreement is - which is free of form in Dutch law, and I imagine in quite a few other European countries as well.
I also think this is no different for automatic charges in the US - I suspect it's not a matter of what is legally allowed, but how it is followed up on.


Sure, but I doubt that's any different in the US (at least in theory).


I think that this is the big difference between SEPA and the US banking system. In the US, it can apparently be quite hard to get rid of unauthorized withdrawals, while that is *usually* easier in NL (and again, I suspect other SEPA countries). [That doesn't mean it never goes wrong...](

The \*coin daemon accepts string arguments, not floats - those strings just happen to be made up of numbers, and have a dot in them. The problem with "keeping things as a float" is that you're not *actually* keeping them as a float - you're casting them from some input format (likely a string), to a float, back to a string. You're losing precision in that process, which is the *exact* reason you shouldn't use floats for anything other than display purposes.
The correct way is to keep all amounts as "amount of satoshis" (or whatever the smallest unit of a \*coin is), and either use a library specifically for financial/precise operations, or at the very least cast it to a string and add in the dot at the right place.
EDIT: Unless the language/framework you're working with has a 'financial' or other precise decimal type, of course. Then you should use that.

Interesting how you apparently choose to misinterpret or misread nearly every point I mention.


Despite all the recent panic about double-spending unconfirmed transactions, it is still perfectly possible to accept unconfirmed transactions for small amounts (for example, a cup of coffee). When larger transactions are made, these are typically not transactions that require instant 5-second processing. There is a reason I said **fast transactions** and not fast confirmations.


Which is *exactly* why I said 'low/optional' and not just 'low'. Reading comprehension.


Again, reading comprehension.


That *includes* choosing who to outsource the security of your money to. I'm really not sure how you could've misinterpreted this one - **if you don't want the security of your money under your own control, then *you are free to outsource that to somebody else*, without that being a requirement.** That was the whole point I was making.


I don't understand how you even consider this a remotely valid response. This doesn't even begin to touch upon what Bitcoin is or can do - Bitcoin is not a debit card. Bitcoin is not something to withdraw money from ATMs. Bitcoin is a purpose-agnostic way of currency bookkeeping.  That is a **much larger scope** than what a debit card does. Comparing it to a debit card makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
If you want to send money to any arbitrary country *without actually physically going there*, then you're going to be shit out of luck, and you'll quickly find out that this simply isn't a reasonable or affordable thing to do for many countries. Let alone global e-commerce transactions. And those are just two very obvious examples that have absolutely nothing to do with debit cards - and are definitely not facilitated by them - and where Bitcoin solves a problem.


I am not talking about, or interested in, exchange rates. I am talking about Bitcoin. The protocol. The concept. The network. The exchange rate doesn't matter even one bit for its continued existence. It has absolutely *nothing* to do with this thread of discussion. Whatsoever.

Okay, I'm getting tired of this going in circles. **Prove to me, incontrovertibly, that Bitcoin development has sped up security improvements as a whole. That means with clear statistics, not by pointing at random projects.**
You seem to be completely unaware of the pre-Bitcoin ecosystem, so unless you come up with statistics that *show* this increase in security improvements, you're just not qualified to make that statement. That you are only discovering things just now doesn't mean that they weren't being worked on before.


Okay, so, exactly what has been going on with crypto and security for a long time. Again, you are comparing the Bitcoin ecosystem to an ecosystem that you are not familiar with *at all*. You are not qualified to speak on this topic.


No, it's not possible to prevent it. BIP38 won't help you when you have a keylogger (so, basically any malware), and MultiSig does nothing but changing the location/medium where/how keys are stored. This is at best mitigation and, like I already said, is not new.


You seem to be under the impression that there is somehow always some to-be-implemented thing. There isn't. When something is feature-complete, it is feature-complete. To be frank, your "but it must stay in constant movement!" is ridiculous and exactly *counter* to a reliable security ecosystem.


Sorry, what? You are claiming that Bitcoin somehow gave the incentive for companies to develop GUI virtualization? I'd love to see a source on that. You just seem to be making shit up at this stage.


Ask average Joe that. I've been arguing these topics with average Joes for years, and the reality is that *the majority of people just doesn't give a shit.*


No, it's not, and I never made such a statement. Stop trying to use strawman arguments against me.


Because *that's what their fucking usecase is!* There is simply no desire of the average Joe to use these things, so it would be a colossal waste of time to design for them. This is what "target market" means. It's ridiculous to claim that you can't design something tailored to a specific group of people.




I already answered these.


This is unrelated to SQRL as a protocol.


No, it wasn't, and it still isn't. What do you think the scalability development is about?


Because there are problems with the older standards? Because they suffer from a case of 'Not Invented Here'? Because of internal disputes? Because of any number of other human biases?


It doesn't do "the exact same thing". It tries to fulfill the same *purpose*. That's something very different. Again, read the specification and note the differences.




These are misleading statements. Those Bitcoin wallets also 'already have' the same crypto functions and libraries that SQRL uses. I'm not going to try and explain this further - I've already tried that, and you don't appear to be picking up on it.


[citation needed]


Whether it's easier to implement is irrelevant. We're *talking about a fucking authentication protocol here*, not about a word processor.
Finally, I have one question for you. **Why are you still trying to argue against the use of SQRL, when it's still unclear why BitID is even a project in the first place?** You should be asking BitID developers for clarification regarding their issues with SQRL, rather than arguing against me.

I'm in the Netherlands. If I wanted to buy BTC from Bitonic, anything up to 50 euro would not require verification, and would happen instantly through iDeal, the Dutch online payment system (from traditional banks). Above that amount, I'd have to send them a transaction of 1 eurocent as verification, which would go through in a day - that's the worst-case scenario.
if I wanted to accept BTC as a business in the Netherlands, I'd just sign up with Mollie, which offers basically the same merchant service that Coinbase and BitPay do, except they support a shitload of other payment methods, too.
Before Bitonic was around, I've used Bittiraha to sell my BTC using a SEPA transfer. No verification hassle, and they arrived in some 3 days.
I'm really not convinced that Coinbase has much to bring to the table in this area.

This has been an implication throughout the entirety of your posts. You have repeatedly presented 'features' of BitID or Bitcoin as if they are somehow groundbreaking, or even explicitly stated that a phenomenon hasn't happened before, when in reality it has been happening for a long time.


I was refering to your claim that many developers of *other* Bitcoin-related software/wallets had supposedly found security issues in Bitcoin independently. The majority of BIPs is written by the same people involved in core development, so that statement doesn't hold true.


That's quite literally not possible. If the box holding your keys gets owned, it's game over. No Bitcoin software can protect against this sufficiently, and no Bitcoin software ever will. No other software ever will either, for that matter. Your best hope is [full OS-level GUI virtualization]( which is far from production-ready and has nothing to do with Bitcoin whatsoever. "Box owned, game over" has always been the assumption in (digital) cryptographical design.


[Hardly a new invention.]( You don't encrypt files with your key, by the way - you encrypt them with the (public) key of the recipient (using a block cipher with an ephemeral shared key).


Such as a [YubiKey]( you mean? Or [RSA SecurID](


Ah, you mean like [Enigmail]( Not to mention that PGP has numerous usability issues of its own that other implementations (such as OTR) do not have.
None of this is new.


What does this even have to do with my point? I was simply pointing out that more development based on these cryptographic primitives take place. I fail to see how media reporting is even remotely related to that.


Pretty much none of them *besides* Tor are designed for your average Joe. They have a very narrowly designed scope. If you are somebody for who Tahoe-LAFS would be relevant, for example, it's piss easy to set up and use.


This is a problem with people and their attitude, not with software.


Except for, I don't know, pretty much all the effort going into Tor that doesn't go towards scalability? There's *tons* of work being done on this, but it's very hard - if not impossible - to fix stupid. This is not an issue with the software, even if people try to solve it through it. Hell, just look at the many stupid ways in which people lose Bitcoins.


.. what?


Uhm, because no matter how good you make the software, stupid behaviour is going to undo it all? I'm really not sure why you're even asking this. This isn't a problem with key storage, it's a problem with human behaviour, and is not solvable through key storage.


Because that way you just move the "box" that contains the private keys (partially) to a different place that may not run things that create a large attack surface? Again, this is not new, authentication devices and other dedicated cryptographical (enterprise) devices have been doing this for a long time.




Have you considered that these two might be related?


And it hasn't occurred to you that perhaps they're not being updated because the implementation is complete?


Which they could've also done with SQRL instead of BitID, and they would've had a better authentication system for it. Not to mention that this means that a significant amount of software is now running on an evidently insecure draft of the protocol, because somebody felt they had to reinvent the wheel. I'm not sure what's so hard to understand about this, you seem to be going in circles.


So why is it already being implemented in its current state? And why are they (still!) reinventing something *that is already readily available in the form of SQRL*?


I don't think you understand what I mean here. Anything that says "Bitcoin" right now seems cool to people, regardless of whether it actually has anything to do with Bitcoin or not, and regardless of whether it's actually a good idea or not. *That* is what is leading the adoption of BitID, not that it's some particularly well-implemented authentication scheme (it's not).


The Bitcoin-QT guys seem to generally know what they are doing. I am not aware of any of the Armory developers having a (documented) background in crypto - and they *are* still using bitcoind after all, their own crypto implementation (insofar it exists) is very limited. I am unable to find any involvement in anything crypto-related of the Mycelium devs, prior to their involvement in Bitcoin projects. And that's not even touching on the myriad other wallets where the developers appear to be careless, unqualified, or it isn't even clear who they are and what their history is...


That sounds like an accurate analogy to me.

Your personal dismissal of the damage that the Bitcoin Foundation is doing "because we all know it already anyway" doesn't keep them from actually doing that damage, and you're effectively just letting them continue unchecked.

As mentioned in my other comment, I hadn't even noticed the reference, and they do not elaborate on it at all.


Signing a message is a pretty basic thing to do in cryptography. This isn't unique for Bitcoin, and I doubt that Bitcoin has any implementation that is significantly different from your average garden variety crypto-signing implementation.
Implementing SQRL signing...
1. Wouldn't take a significant amount of time (assuming good practice is followed and existing reviewed libraries are used).
2. Wouldn't be any more complex from a UX point of view.
3. Wouldn't require any significant changes to other aspects of the application.
In other words, yes, on paper it sounds like BitID is a 'logical continuation'. In practice, however, it doesn't provide any notable advantages over just implementing SQRL, while introducing a mountain of possible security issues. There's really no point to using Bitcoin signing, other than to make it sound fancy like it's "a Bitcoin thing".
@_date: 2014-09-11 19:32:33
Possibly. They may not even invent a new currency, just try to somehow incorporate existing currencies into blockchain-like technology, with some kind of bank-exchange mechanism (similar to the proposed gold-backed cryptocurrency proposals around 2010). There's quite a few options for building a currency that *looks* like a decentralized cryptocurrency, but actually isn't.
@_date: 2014-09-11 19:34:52
Perhaps. That wouldn't be very different from any other asset to invest in, though.
Yes, it's quite possible that Bitcoin will drown out the traditional banking system. It's also quite possible that a scheme like this prevents that from occurring. It's important to stay vigilant for any attempted "coopting" (I don't like the word, but can't come up with any synonyms), and to not just sit back and look smug.

That's why I'm constantly calling for a (third-party) audit. An experienced cryptographer (with peripheral hardware knowledge) would likely be able to give at least an initial reliable judgment as to whether the algorithm stacking would live up to its claim of providing more security and/or more ASIC-resistance - even if he can't tell with 100.00% certainty.
I am not a cryptographer myself, so all I can do is think of possible ways this could not work out as planned, and be skeptical. What concerns me is that the developers also do not seem to be cryptographers - and if they are, they're definitely missing the cryptographer mindset - and the ecosystem/community around it seems more concerned with telling people that "it'll all be fine, trust the devs" than with actually making an attempt at verifying claims or calling for an audit.

What, exactly, do you think has been happening since approximately the start of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-18 00:35:58
There's a problem with the wording there:


This implies that it's stored "securely" so that it's "ensured" that nobody but the intended recipient can read them; however, you cannot ensure that (what if it gets compromised? And you can always read them anyway). It's effectively still a meaningless claim.
That section should really focus on the possible weak points inherent to such a service, rather than emphasizing the strong points. Right now PGP is just thrown in there as an after-thought, and it's completely unclear to a novice user why anybody would use PGP for it, or what gain there is from it - or rather, what risk there is by *not* using it.

You'll want to make sure to look into Bitcoin Armory if you're not already using it; it has a pretty decent offline transaction signing setup. That said, I'm not sure if it supports transaction data exchange through QR/webcam - moving a USB thumbdrive between two machines isn't exactly the safest option either...

No, BTC is like IP. Currently IPv4 is the dominant version, that will become IPv6 in the future. They're based on the same concepts.
It's no different for BTC - a change to the core protocol would just be a new 'version' of sorts, which can be propagated and supersede the old Bitcoin protocol version. You don't need a separate protocol for that.

"Vote with your wallet" (pun not intended) has never worked, and likely will never work. There's a very simple reason for that: those with nefarious intentions are generally willing to go to much farther lengths to convince others of their POV, than those with "legitimate" intentions.

There's a bunch of problem with it.
1. Bitcoin is not 'anonymous'.
2. Transactions are not simply "free of charge" - while it is *possible* to send a transaction without a fee, this is likely to lead to delays, and most clients will not do this by default. Regardless of whether it's possible, it's misleading to state this as a default.
3. There's a lot of typos. "PayPall" instead of "PayPal", "weeeks" instead of "weeks", "minute" instead of "minutes", "enterpreneur" instead of "entrepreneur"...
4. It focuses far too much on the "OMG you could be rich if you use Bitcoin". Bitcoin is a currency, not a get-rich-quick scheme.
Definitely not the best Bitcoin explanation video on the internet (but I suspect that was just linkbait anyway). It does more marketing than explaining.
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:50:46


Yes, Bitcoin is still small. And provided that no fatal flaws are found in its design, it will eventually grow. Foundation or not.


What's the problem with personal accountability? That's kind of the point of decentralization - not only giving people the choice to take control, but also having them take the associated responsibility. I feel like you're trying to fit Bitcoin into the mold of existing payment systems/currencies and people's perspective of them - that is not how it works.


"X is a fantasy" is one of those red flags, along with "in the real world [...]", that typically indicate somebody doesn't actually *have* a valid point, and is merely frustrated that a new or unpopular concept doesn't fit into their existing world view. Don't be that guy.
If you have a valid point, you can argue the point itself, rather than having to resort to calling other things a "fantasy" or otherwise.

Great way to start out your argument, telling somebody that his field doesn't really require specialized knowledge at all, despite you evidently not having worked in that field professionally and thus not being able to judge this.
Newsflash: Installing Wordpress or Joomla with a bunch of plugins is *not* web development.


It's not. Unless you like having a storefront that looks like your fourth-grade niece threw it together, and that randomly errors out on the user half of the time, thus costing you sales.


Great. What does this have to do with selectively disabling a payment method for a specific product? Oh right, nothing.


Hahahaha, no. There are countless security issues with off-the-shelf software, especially with exotic plugins for exotic usecases, and *especially* (albeit not exclusively) in the PHP ecosystem. Show me a PHP shopping cart plugin with less than 1000 users, and I could probably show you a vulnerability of some sort.


If you value the continued operation of your business(!), then no, it's not. If you "copy and paste files via an FTP client", then you are almost certainly not a properly qualified software developer.


If you run WordPress, you should not be operating a storefront.


Great, who's going to integrate it with your theme? And with the other conflicting plugins that also try to modify your list of payment gateways based on a conditional of some sort? Certainly not the plugin author.

Helpful tip for people interested in these (activist-y) topics:
__Whenever somebody's proposal includes the word '*recruit*' or a variation thereof, be very very wary.__
Almost without exception, these proposals originate from an "infinite growth" mindset, where the proposing entity puts (rapid) growth of the network/group/etc. above anything else, even if it means abandoning principles or goals.
The proposal will virtually always involve 'defeating the point' of a project or group, just to "collect more souls". As far as I can tell, people do this primarily because it makes them feel like they're part of something big.
I've seen this happen countless times within Anonymous, where people would come in and suggest *"why don't you restrict Anonymous to these and these 'good' topics?"*, completely ignoring that this would defeat the very point of Anonymous. When pointing this out to them, the only response is usually *"but think of all the people who would suddenly want to be Anons!"*

Right. You should probably push a little for an investigation into whether it disappeared through a vulnerability in their system, or simply through your password being guessed/bruteforced/etc. They should have bruteforce protection in place anyway.
And be sure to use randomized passwords in the future; they literally can't be guessed. [KeePass]( (or [KeePassX]( on OSX/Linux) are great for this.
@_date: 2014-04-05 09:07:09
The simple answer: yes.
The more complex answer: the only way to have a truly secure storage for a cryptocurrency (or anything sharing its characteristics), without completely defeating usability (eg. over-the-top password requirements), is to have a system where every single point of access is known, documented and guarded. That necessarily means that your platform needs to be as simple as it can be, while providing the functionality necessary. A mobile platform has far too many "side-features" that are hard to audit, prone to change, and even harder to defend against.
It's like living in a giant mansion on your own, with all the doors unlocked - there's absolutely no way you're going to notice somebody on the other side of the mansion stealing your valuables, because you can't oversee everything. The various secret passages (the technical equivalent of this would be "undocumented features") only make this harder.
Realistically, such a dedicated 'device' does not have to be expensive or bulky. The RFID chip in that pack of underwear you just paid for at the counter, is also a 'device', and it is quite a bit more complex than you'd initially expect. It's not unrealistic to expect dedicated hardware wallets to eventually take on the form factor of a credit card. And at that point, it's just "yet another card in my wallet", and the entire "but it's an additional device" discussion simply stops being relevant.

No, it's not. It's a much more simplified (and less well-defined) authentication scheme that tries to solve the same problem that SQRL has already solved, except starting from scratch. It's also not compatible with SQRL or any other mechanism.


The point is that *that's not what you're doing!* You don't "use your money to authenticate", you use a *keypair* to do so - a keypair like any other. There's no reason to try and shoehorn this into Bitcoin somehow - it doesn't provide any advantages, and really only comes with drawbacks and a lot of wasted effort.
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:17:16
Some of the biggest ones:
* Resistance against (financial) censorship or meddling of any sort
* Fully under own control; by extension, this means deciding for yourself on who you trust or do not trust with the security of your money
* Resilience; decentralized nature removes single point of failure
* No borders
* Fast transactions
* Easy to get from point A to B
* Low/optional transaction fees
* Fungible
* Extensibility (not just technically, but also conceptually - see for example 'provably fair betting')

Well, the problem is that "the filesystem" is considered a less-privileged thing than "the RAM". You wouldn't want an arbitrary local application dicking around with RAM that doesn't belong to itself - and it would be a very clear sign that something bad is going on, see also DEP - but a local application being able to read out arbitrary stuff on the filesystem under your user is 'probably okay'.
By storing something in the filesystem instead of RAM, you're basically storing it in a place that's not meant to be as secure as RAM would have been, a lower 'tier' so to say. A lot of (security-related) software will make that assumption as well, which opens up the possibility of undetected malicious access to it.
Similarly, developers of locally-running software will be less careful about restricting filesystem access (eg. preventing LFI-type / path traversal attacks), even if they wouldn't dream of exposing arbitrary memory access.
@_date: 2014-08-13 00:38:17

EDIT: A more elaborate answer: 
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:56:01
Having /tmp on a ramdrive doesn't really make a difference, though. Even if it's technically in RAM, it's still accessible as a filesystem. The filesystem-related attack vectors are related to the *representation* as a filesystem (and thus accessibility through the relevant APIs), not to the fact that it is physically stored on a disk.
Aside from that, I'm not sure I understand why you're storing it in a RAR inside a KeePass DB to begin with - just KeePass should be sufficient. If you don't want it to be accessible with your regular KeePass master key, then simply store it in a separate KeePass DB with a different password.
EDIT: Sidenote, definitely look into KeePassX. It's a native implementation of KeePass for *nix.

It's not really a viable strategy.

Naturally, that applies regardless of method.

* Bitcoin regulation: again, clearly not compatible - if Bitcoin was meant to be regulated, why would governments not be appointed to control the blockchain? Why would it be made so that no single entity can control the network?
* Hiding Bitcoin usage: when you hide Bitcoin usage, and people do not learn about the nature of Bitcoin, that directly impairs the ability to accomplish the above two things.
These examples I've given are in direct contradiction with the *design* of Bitcoin, not the intention I or Satoshi assigned to it. To make these examples reality, requires changes to the core Bitcoin protocol and ecosystem; changes that are inherently incompatible with Bitcoin's design.
All this reminds me very strongly of the myriad people who came onto AnonOps, claiming that "Anonymous needs to pick a leader to represent them", and various other suggestions that amounted to "make it like existing charities" - completely failing to recognize that that would defeat the very point and right of existence of Anonymous.
Eventually this *did* happen to some degree: YourAnonNews grew bigger and bigger until it was basically the single heard voice within Anonymous.... [and the rest was history]( I warned for this within Anonymous years ago, and those warnings were largely ignored, with the above consequences. I'm hoping that the same mistake won't be made here.

To the best of my knowledge, it is intended as an identifier for a transaction *that has been absorbed into a block*. In other words, a 'permalink' of sorts for informational purposes. It lets you do stuff like referencing transactions on blockchain.info, or even bookkeeping (assuming you are implementing things correctly, and getting the transaction ID *after* it has been absorbed into a block).
It can be used as an identifier, just not until the transaction has been 'set in stone'; that is, processed in a block.

Jesus, chill the fuck out.
Bitcoin - which I assume is what you're refering to - is *not* built on top of a commercial foundation. Even if the concept itself is meant to facilitate commerce, the protocol itself is open, agnostic, not controlled or organized by a central party, and there is no one single party that stands to profit or 'skim off' from Bitcoin usage - which is, as far as I have been able to understand, *exactly* what the business model of Maidsafe is.
No matter how supposedly ethical Maidsafe's business model would be, by building a "new internet" on top of it, you introduce an "internet" where the primary requirement for participation is basically giving money to Maidsafe. It's as if you'd have to pay IANA for every packet you sent, no matter where you lived or what ISP you had. Maidsafe will hold a financial undisputable monopoly.
Maidsafe is the exact *opposite* of decentralization of power. It just exchanges regulatory centralization for financial centralization.

Because its core functionality (*and I am not talking about the exchange rate!*) and core advantages are and remain true, regardless of public perception, regardless of legislation, and regardless of adoption. It is not affected by environmental factors. This means there is always some guaranteed basis of usage.


Yes and no. The general adoption of new technologies is such that, at first, they are ridiculed at large because people don't see the value in looking into it well enough to understand it. This leads to misunderstanding the concept or benefits, and thus resorting to considering it a joke.
Over time, people start wondering "hey, is $technology still around? I wonder why...", and they start looking into why it's not dead yet. This is the adoption you're seeing, not only with Bitcoin, but also with other technologies.
The bottom line here is that, over time, the impression that people have of Bitcoin will change, as they start actually trying to understand what's going on with it. The "guaranteed basis of usage" is what ensures Bitcoin doesn't die before that gets a chance of happening.

For a bit more context; the kind of hotels that is refering to are mostly 'prefab' hotels - the most widespread chain of these is most likely Accor, who carries a number of budget brands.
Their low-end hotels are generally nothing more than a room with a bed, TV, washbasin, electricity outlets, (usually shared) toilet/shower cubicles, and sometimes (free) WiFi. They also tend to offer a very spartan breakfast in the morning in the reception area - but it costs extra, of course. There's usually not any service at night - no hotel staff is present unless they are called, there are machines on the outside that let you book a room, and you can't get inside the building unless you have a room booked.
Formule 1 (or 'F1 Hotel') is the cheapest of them, is primarily found in France, and a room will cost about €30 to €40 for a night in most places. [These are some pictures of an F1 Hotel]( the one in Colmar if I recall correctly.
Accor also has some slightly more expensive and less 'prefab' hotels, such as Ibis Budget (formerly Etap) and Ibis - these are more in the €40 - €90 per night range. Ibis Budget is somewhat similar to the F1 Hotels although less obviously prefab (still lots of plastic IKEA-type furniture, for example), but regular Ibis is considerably more 'luxurious' - they have an actual reception desk (usually manned 24/7), 'proper' furniture, and in-hotel restaurants (at least, the Schiphol one did).
One very big upside to the low-end Accor hotels, as compared to (apparently) a lot of cheap hotels/motels in the US, is that their hotels are consistently clean and generally well-maintained. They're also very consistent - of each low-end 'daughter chain' of Accor, there's probably only 2 or 3 designs/versions of it in existence across Europe, so you always know what you can expect.
Accor isn't the only chain; there's a [few other ones]( - but if you speak to anybody who has ever been on holiday to France by car, they'll almost certainly know what the F1 Hotel is :)

Those two statements are patently wrong. I'm not sure what response to give here, other than "read up on the history of security and cryptography".


Again, wrong in the exact same sense. Bitcoin is inventive, has the potential to be revolutionary, but it is in no way the first of its kind.




Quite simply because PGP has a narrowly defined scope, and it is effectively feature-complete. What more is there to develop on PGP specifically? Development for the sake of development is a waste of time, and just leads to hard-to-audit feature-bloated software. If anything, it's harmful.
Instead, people work with the foundations of PGP (which happen to be the same foundations that Bitcoin is built upon) and build new things on top of that. This is not something that magically started happening with Bitcoin, even if that's the first you heard of it. Hell, look at projects like Tor, Freenet, Tahoe-LAFS, I2P... All of these pre-date Bitcoin, and build upon some form of public key cryptography in the same way that the things you describe build on Bitcoin.


Quite simply - key storage for Bitcoin is not any different conceptually from key storage for any other public key cryptography application. The reason you see people letting other people know that their PGP key should be assumed compromised, is because they assume the worst case - that is, that somebody will have magically found a way to break the security of PGP keys, and it's safer to just assume it has been compromised as a whole. That's the exact same (correct) security-paranoid attitude that you were refering to. If your wallet gets stolen, regardless of whether it has a password on it, *you should be doing the exact same thing*.
Key storage is effectively a solved problem, and has been for a long time. Bitcoin - or its ecosystem - doesn't bring anything new to the table here, other than potentially some optimizations that are specific to the use of Bitcoin as a blockchain protocol (which thus do not extend to using it as an authentication mechanism). There's nothing to win here.


See previous answer. The amount of implementations is also hardly a good metric - it doesn't tell you how many *good* implementations are, and the only advantage BitID has here is first-mover advantage (which is effectively based entirely on the Bitcoin hype train, as is visible in eg. this thread).


What makes you think that SQRL is dead? [It was only released in October of last year.](


That's not what [the draft specification]( says:
"After a Bitcoin address is chosen, or created on the fly, the full bitid URI is signed with the address’ private key. The signature and public key are then POSTed to the callback url."


I hadn't even noticed the SQRL reference (it's not even elaborated on), but this is a question you should be asking the developers of BitID, not me.


It's quite likely that this has nothing to do with deciding that "SQRL is not sufficient" - if you have a source for that being the reason, please do share it. It's more likely that either:
1. SQRL is considered "too hard to implement", or
2. BitID caught their attention because of the hype train around it.
I should add that most of the people working on Bitcoin wallets are probably not qualified to implement crypto, and may very well miss a basic understanding of good practices - which can lead to decisions based on "which is easier to implement", rather than "which is more secure".


Some basic rules of cryptography for non-experts, off the top of my head:
1. If you're rolling your own cryptography, you're doing it wrong.
2. If something seems easy, it means you're missing something. If your implementation is simpler than that of somebody else, you have concrete evidence of *what* it is that you're missing. This one is particularly applicable to BitID.
3. End users will fuck up. Every time.
4. Cryptography is a line of defense, not the be-all-end-all of security.
5. Impenetrable crypto doesn't exist. You're not trying to make it impossible to crack, you're trying to make it hard enough to crack that it isn't worth the effort/expenses.
6. If it's new crypto, be wary. Newer crypto means less review, scrutiny, and audits.
7. If you cannot see the exact inner workings of a cryptographical primitive or implementation, you should assume it to be faulty.
8. If you need to hide the internal workings of your cryptographical primitive or implementation "for security reasons", it is faulty. See also [Kerckhoff's Principle](
9. Everybody is your adversary.
10. Cryptography isn't a game - doing it wrong can literally cost lives.
Authentication is one of the most critical things that cryptography can be responsible for.


PGP is just a single cryptographical implementation - in this case, one that is meant to provide authentication, confidentiality, and integrity:
* Authentication: through identity-verifiable signatures.
* Integrity: through those signatures being of the message body.
* Confidentiality: through encrypting that message body with the key(s) of the recipient(s).
PGP is not a cryptographical primitive or algorithm - it just uses common algorithms like RSA, to form a 'suite' that provides the above functionality. But OpenSSH also uses RSA. And so do the implementations of many proprietary 'encrypted communication' applications. And OpenSSL does too. And many other things do.
Basically, pretty much anything that does public key cryptography uses algorithms that PGP/GPG could also be using. PGP still doesn't have anything to do with them, in the same way that a Honda Civic and a Tesla have nothing to do with each other, despite both being cars and having roughly the same components under the hood.
EDIT: I am not a cryptography expert. My understanding of cryptography is good enough to roughly understand what goes on behind the scenes, and more importantly, how to detect 'red flags' and how to detect what not to touch. I'm at [stage 2 of the scale of competence]( so to say.

Not really. Unless the VPN is under your control, you're just moving the snooping point from your WiFi provider to your VPN provider. Plaintext data is still sent in plaintext in the end.
If you want to be reasonably secure on a public WiFI AP, either use a self-hosted VPN, or use Tor.

As for one password giving access to everything; this is no different from password reuse, except you remove an attack vector because you don't send the master password to third parties anymore. Similarly, maintaining separate DBs is no different from having several reused passwords. This is not a problem with password managers.
As for being keylogged / having the DB stolen / etc.: it's already game over. Once your own box has been compromised, you're fucked, and no amount of security-related software or practices will protect you against that.
EDIT: No, don't use a "password-encrypted RAR". Managers like KeePass(X?) can handle multiple password databases just fine. Just keep it in a separate database. Trying to 'stack' other encryption technologies onto it will only weaken your security; for example, have you considered that storing anything in an encrypted RAR means that the plaintext will be *written to disk every time you use it*? This is not the case with password databases, which decrypt purely in RAM.
Never try to outsmart the 'security guys'. You'll almost certainly screw it up. Security and cryptography are hard.

I'd like to respond to a few points:


There's not really a way to reliably determine the reason for this. Are less things being sold for BTC? Are less people daytrading? Are more transactions done off-chain? Without this vital piece of information, there's no reasonable way you could determine the decline of trading volume to be either good or bad news.


As far as I can see, the point of brick-and-mortar acceptance for many Bitcoin enthusiasts isn't so much their own convenience, as it is a PR move. Being able to pay "IRL" with Bitcoins makes the whole thing more tangible to people. It makes people (unconsciously) realize that it isn't just some arbitrary number in a database, like WoW gold is. From a "public perception" point of view, brick-and-mortar acceptance is an absolutely crucial step in adoption.


This is not actually a problem. The volatility of Bitcoin has already been decreasing since its inception, and is continuing to do so. No banks or other "institutional money" have turned out to be necessary for that.
The mistake I think you're making here in your reasoning, is that you're treating Bitcoin adoption as if there's an urgency; as if there is a market to capitalize on before a competitor does. That is not the case - Bitcoin is not a commercial centralized project. Bitcoin adoption will certainly take some time (and it's actually already moving much faster than I'd expected at first), and "institutional money" is not a requirement for that.
The only people who benefit from "institutional money" or "venture capital" in the long run, are those receiving the money and those handing it out. It doesn't play an irreplaceable role within Bitcoin itself.


I'm sure. The difference is that they can do far less damage, because they do not have a monopoly on either control or knowledge of Bitcoin. They can't do anything more than anybody else with a wad of money.


That's actually just plain false - Bitcoin doesn't work that way. The "market cap" of Bitcoin is purely a projection of value based on the *current* exchange rate. It does not take into account changes in that exchange rate *once you actually start buying up Bitcoins*.
In simpler terms: good luck buying the last Bitcoin. You'd be paying dearly for it.


I think you'd be surprised.

The common - practical, not philosophical - problem I see with this, however, is that it's very very hard to actually *enforce* the GPL. Due to the brokenness of the copyright system (which you seemed to hint at as well), it's nearly impossible for an individual or even small group to pursue prosecution for GPL violation, and even open-source foundations only have a limit amount of budget and time to allocate to such cases.
Taking into account not just the theoretical effects but also how they play out in practice, I would say that the GPL, while in some (but not all) ways a noble effort, offers more drawbacks than advantages as compared to liberal licenses, and isn't really very useful. At least in the current copyright model.

The short summary is this:
You have roughly 3 'camps'.
1. Those who believe Tor is infallible, and impossible for anybody to break, no matter what. They are wrong, there's not much more to say about that.
2. Those who believe Tor is generally secure when used correctly, but weaknesses do exist and it requires constant diligence.
3. Those who believe Tor is broken and compromised by the NSA / FBI / GCHQ / whatever.
Now both option 2 and 3 are technically possible. The problem is that **those who believe in option 3, do not have the evidence for it.** I've talked to many people who believe that Tor is compromised entirely, and every single one of them concluded this because:
* Tor development is funded by government entities, or
* They misunderstand the threat model that Tor is meant to protect against, or
* They fail to understand that Tor is not a foolproof technical solution and still requires end-user vigilance, or
* They do not understand the way Tor is designed and assume that the involvement of "untrusted nodes" means it's automatically compromised, or
* Somebody else told them that Tor is broken, and they believed it without doing their own research or even bothering to ask them for proof.
There are currently no known backdoors - and the source code can be freely inspected - or unpatched vulnerabilities that entail a full compromise of the security model (to my knowledge).
While I am not excluding that Tor *might* be broken, those who say it's broken generally do so out of misunderstanding or ignorance, not because they have a genuine reason for believing that it is.

It's just an idiot/troll filter. Nothing more, nothing less.
EDIT: And as mentioned below, I didn't actually take a stance. That would have been more or less impossible anyway; when somebody presents a false dichotomy, taking any stance prior to agreement that it's a false dichotomy is pretty much a guarantee that:
1. My reply will be misinterpreted (because it's read in the context of a dichotomy that doesn't exist), or
2. Assumptions are made about other aspects of my point of view, based on which option in the false dichotomy I appear to be 'closest' to.
Neither is desirable.

You're missing the point.
*PR doesn't really matter.*
DarkMarket, like Bitcoin, can exist and thrive perfectly fine on the 'fringes', if that were to be how things played out. It has an inherent value, an inherent usefulness and, unlike centralized projects, it does not need a good reputation to guard itself against closure or retaliation. It exists because it exists. It doesn't *need* to have "mainstream adoption".
The only requirement is to make people *aware of its existence*. Once people start having the need for such a platform, they will find it. Reputation does not play a role there.
Trying to make it sound 'friendlier' is just obscuring the idea behind it. You 'lose the message', so to say. If you want a *truly* free market, then it's not just about the technical aspect. It's about the social perception that free trade, of *any* kind, is okay. 'Watering down' the name of this project to make it more 'socially acceptable' will not get you there.

The loss of precision isn't necessarily just in arithmetic operations. Depending on the implementation and circumstances, solely storing something as a float may result in lost precision. It's just not worth it to take the risk.
As for '8 decimal points' - you should not assume this. The Bitcoin protocol (and that of other \*coins) can theoretically be changed to support smaller denominations, in which case changing the storage format or smallest-denomination calculation is a lot less error-prone than getting rid of floats after-the-fact.

Friendly warning: VPNs are *not* anonymous or private, no matter how much VPN providers want you to believe that they are. You're effectively just proxying all your traffic through them - which means that they can see any traffic that isn't encrypted. You have no way to verify that they don't keep logs, or that they don't pass on your data to something/somebody else.
Really, the only things that VPNs (in the commercial sense) are good for, are ban evasion and "I don't want this site to have my IP". Both are extremely narrow usecases.
A VPN won't reliably protect you from a government, nor from somebody trying to sue you over downloading a torrent.

I responded to it there, I'll repost it here:
The point of a QR code is to be error-tolerant; it can be scanned with a relatively low-quality scanner or camera module, and you still effectively have a guarantee that the scan will come out valid and un-corrupted.
That’s not the case with a URL (nor will it ever be) – your camera needs to have a particular resolution, lens quality, stabilisation mechanisms, etc. to even *begin* thinking about OCRing out URLs. It’s also not even close to the feature described in the article – creditcard numbers have checksum digits (with a similar purpose to error correction in QR codes, albeit more human-error-focused), whereas URLs do not.
Added complexity comes from the fact that a single mis-OCR of a character in a URL will render the entire URL effectively unusable. WordLens does not have this problem – it can ‘guess’ the correct word, autocorrect-style.
If OCRing URLs is ever going to be a reality, it’s quite far away. You won’t see it being relied upon until high-resolution high-quality stabilized camera modules are a given, even in lower-end hardware.

That's not my experience. You just need to be vigilant about who you buy from. I frequently buy random stuff from BuyInCoins, for example, which as far as I know started out as a Chinese eBay seller (though they have their own site now). I think the same applies for Lightake, which I also use occasionally. And there's of course always the classic DX, though I don't think they have an eBay history.
All of these have worked well so far, some more than others (especially BIC is really nice). Chinese sellers really aren't inherently scammy - it's very possible that this is just a bug, most likely something with a frontend proxy that's not handling sessions correctly. You really shouldn't knock these guys (Pesobang, that is) before trying :)

You're looking at it from the wrong perspective. The '12 word passphrase' isn't treated as a set of characters, but as an *encoded* set of characters.
Think of it like a 12-character password, where every character is picked from an alphabet that is the size of a dictionary.
Just changing characters in there wouldn't help; you'd just be using words that aren't in the dictionary. Now I'm not sure if Electrum actually uses a full-fledged English dictionary or not, but the principle remains the same.

"Everybody can log into your accounts and steal your shit" is a pretty strong incentive, I'd say. And I honestly don't think there even *are* that many "convenient ways for keeping Bitcoin keys" - *definitely* not more than there are convenient ways for keeping authentication keypairs.


That really doesn't matter. Something doesn't have to be actively developed if it's feature-complete, as long as bugs (whether technical or UX-wise) get patched. Not to mention that how active *Bitcoin* development is, doesn't say anything about how active *BitID* development is. The effort for building BitID would be much better spent on SQRL implementations. This is just reinventing the wheel.

As far as I have been able to tell, the "ease of use" that people derive from an iPad is largely rooted in marketing - which, in turn, has its roots in the exact thing I'm describing. When people are convinced ahead of time that they will understand something, they *will*.
A somewhat different example of this would be this video:  Notice how people approach it when they're told that it's something they already know, and are thus presumably already familiar with.
In the long term, "keeping people dumb" is not the solution. A large part of the way people approach new technology is a cultural issue - it's not a given, it can be changed. By keeping people dumb, you keep them dependent. By keeping people dependent... well, look at what happened with Mt. Gox, MyBitcoin, and so on.
Trying to portray Bitcoin in a different light might be the quick-and-easy 'solution', but in the long term it's going to come back to bite all of us in the ass.

There are several issues with this:
1. The statement on your website is *still* wrong. It *is* copyrighted - regardless of what license you distribute it under.
2. Saying that "it cannot be taken off the community" is a very deceptive blanket statement. Indeed, you cannot revert the licensing on an already released version of the software. **That does not mean that you cannot take away any future versions from the community, thus screwing them over anyway.** There is no guarantee that it *would* be forked, or that that would even be feasible, regardless of whether it is theoretically possible. Something being GPL'ed alone is not enough.
3. The above also does not remove concerns about vendor lock-in. It is my understanding that anything building on the MaidSafe network is considered a "derivative" and thereby subject to either the GPL license or the commercial license. This is unacceptable, and to put it directly, a disgusting practice. You are positioning yourself as the sole gatekeepers of anything that isn't GPL'ed - which not only includes proprietary software, but also software under more liberal licenses. **This kind of monopoly has no place in a supposedly core infrastructure component, full stop.**
There are enough corporations trying to 'own' the internet or have some kind of guaranteed slice of the pie. We don't need more of them. If you *truly* are interested in an open and decentralized internet, you don't abuse strict licenses like the GPL for this. Whether it is under an entirely proprietary license or any other viral license like the GPL, you're still forcing people to do things.

With regards to a vanished person holding a lot of BTC, there's a million possible explanations for that - some nefarious, some legitimate. The 'vanishing' part makes perfect sense from an ideological point of view (take a look at Assange and Snowden to understand why).

They don't seem to have "taken the SQRL idea", that's the whole point. They appear to have started from scratch, completely oblivious to the previous *existence* of SQRL. Which in itself is fine, but it has now been repeatedly brought up and there has been no satisfactory explanation as to why they are continuing to pursue their own implementation when a better alternative is available.


There is no compatibility because compatibility is irrelevant here. SQRL doesn't inherently have anything to do with Bitcoin, nor does BitID. BitID just reuses Bitcoin keypairs (which is a terrible idea), other than that it has nothing to do with Bitcoin *at all*. It doesn't even require having a Bitcoin wallet or even blockchain access - as long as you have the same kind of keypair, you can implement BitID.
It's like saying that a Tesla car isn't compatible with Kelloggs cornflakes - there's nothing to *be* compatible with, they're entirely different things. That both of them may share an ingredient somewhere doesn't change that.
The compatibility problem is *between SQRL and BitID* - [this]( is a relevant summary. There are now just two different competing systems that both have their own adoption and are not interoperable - and one of the two (BitID) is already more poorly-designed than the other.

You should either remove the word "securely", sufficiently explain it, or add a warning that the service can still read the messages and you should use something like GPG if you want full privacy.
I've noticed a tendency of people to just always include "secure" in their marketing copy, because it sounds good. This is a very bad thing. Some things simply *can't* be secure, and by calling it secure anyway, you are misleading users... with potentially disastrous consequences. Mt. Gox was only one example of this, many many more exist.
Don't call it secure when it isn't secure. Security is not a game, and *definitely* not a marketing game.

Bitcoins have (perceived) value for the same reason dollars or euros have value: because people believe in them as a viable instrument of trade, and a viable representation of value. Just like dollars and euros, their exchange rate for other currencies can fluctuate, sometimes heavily. Basic concepts of supply and demand, all that stuff.
There are some pretty big differences between how Bitcoin works and how dollars/euros/etc. work (for example, government currencies being inflationary and Bitcoin most likely being deflationary over time), but the above is pretty much the answer to your question.

I'd argue that the exchange rate in itself doesn't really matter much, it's just a number. A currency isn't inherently better or worse because individual units are worth more or less. Add to that that the smallest common denomination in BTC is the Satoshi (8 decimals) whereas the smallest common denomination in USD is the penny (2 decimals), and it gets even fuzzier.
Far more interesting is the stability of and relative changes in exchange rate between Bitcoins and everything else.

Worst possible alternatives. Tradehill has grown way too quick through a referal system (that has invited rather some spammy behaviour), and Bitcoin7 has already been shown to be insecure and horribly coded (store balances as floats? Really?).
it is probably a good idea to just go to  and find a proper exchange that "plays by the rules", and is preferably open-source so that people can actually check if the code is secure.
Whereas you have funds insurance for IRL closed-source banking systems, you don't for bitcoin exchanges. I would only ever recommend an open-source exchange platform in this situation.

That's addressed in the article, though, specifically in the [linked page about decentralization]( Fewer full nodes does not really centralize the network or affect the security, since security is provided by miners, not full nodes.


Do you have a source for this? As far as I am aware, the amount of data in a block is practically negligible compared to the PoW effort.


How would a less efficient protocol introduce 'additional attack vectors', and what would those vectors be exactly?


That's not really accurate. For a single blocksize increase, yes, this would occur if the latent demand is larger than what the blocksize is increased to - however, for a negotiation protocol that dynamically adjusts blocksizes based on network requirements, this isn't an issue as blocks can grow to accommodate increased transaction volume. Therefore, there would be no congestion in the long run.


Isn't that precisely why there are proposals involving dynamic blocksize adjustment, as opposed to incidental hardforks involving one-time increases?


This sounds very hand-wavy to me. How does censorship resistance require blockchain space scarcity, and how is a blockchain 'unreliable' exactly?
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:10:52


Sure, but miners also have the funds to run a more expensive full node, so that's not a problem.


How do they, concretely?


Sure, but that doesn't have anything to do with network security. There's an entire separate discussion to be had there; namely, how likely is it that the user gets lied to or otherwise treated negatively when using SPV, how much do they want to avoid that, and what is that worth to them? It's not at all clear that "everybody should be able to run a full node" is a valid or useful goal to have.


I remain unconvinced that such a correlation exists, for the reasons already described. You still haven't conclusively reasoned exactly how an increased blocksize will reduce network security, and you're ignoring several of my questions and counterpoints that address the reasons you've given so far.


I have, I just don't consider it significant. Yes, every network is affected by latent demand - but latent demand also always has a ceiling, a point beyond which the latent demand dries up. Unless you can argue why it's undesirable to scale up until all latent demand is fulfilled (that is, all users that want to use Bitcoin but currently cannot), I don't see a problem with continuous scaling, regardless of what it scales to.
It's quite unlikely that Bitcoin would actually be used for 10 billion transactions a week by a single individual; this doesn't mesh with the requirement of transaction fees (that can be imposed by miners). An internal settlement network is much, much cheaper to operate at that scale. Which leaves the cases where such an internal network is impractical, and at that point, why *shouldn't* Bitcoin scale to meet the demand that exists for it?


I've already pointed out that the amount of full nodes does __not__ correlate directly to network decentralization, and you have so far not presented any concrete arguments to show otherwise. That makes this a non-argument.
As for miners: like I already said, miners are *very* likely to have sufficient funds to support running full nodes even when blocks grow considerably. This is even more true when you consider mining pools which, like it or not, are very commonly used (and that will probably remain the case).










While all true, this is an extremely narrow definition of 'reliability' that completely ignores all other aspects of reliability (will a transaction eventually be processed, will it be immutable?). Many other payment networks have other kinds of unreliability (chargebacks, fake cash, etc.), and Bitcoin is not particularly special in this other than picking a different tradeoff.
It's certainly not notable enough to speak of an "unreliable blockchain" - while *technically* speaking you can argue that there are unreliable aspects to it, your phrasing suggests that it is somehow more significant for Bitcoin than for things other than Bitcoin, and that simply isn't true.
(Nitpick: It's not "Blockchain", it's "a blockchain". It's a technical concept and design, not a brand.)

General-purpose reminder things like Boomerang will always be more hacky, less easy to maintain, won't provide statistics to the campaign owner, won't give people the idea of donating every month, seems like a hassle, etc, etc. They're all tiny barriers that, put together, make people just give up on it, donate once, and forget about it in the future.

Inability to "interfere once a crash happens" is a feature, not a bug - it means it's not possible to build pretend-economies like what is happening now.
Volatility will strongly decrease as transactional adoption grows (in fact, if you look at the relative numbers wrt. exchange rate volatility rather than the absolute numbers, you can see that this is already happening).
Supposed "anonymity" in Bitcoins (there isn't any by default, by the way) is not really a concern for a competent law enforcement agency. As can be seen in the few Bitcoin-related cases so far (Silk Road, Trendon Shavers...), "following the money" is not required to follow up on supposedly illegal transactions (and this is from an entirely practical viewpoint, leaving aside whether following up on those transactions is desirable to begin with).
This is somewhat reminiscent of the situation with crackers ("hackers" as media outlets like to call them) who break into stuff; usually they're not caught through their IP address (which they often take great care to hide), but through more social means such as an informant, or simply the suspect not being able to keep his mouth shut.
EDIT: I am aware that you already mentioned the decreasing volatility through adoption, but I think you're looking at it from the wrong perspective; your third point appears to imply that it's somehow expected for everybody to adopt Bitcoin *right now*. That is not the case. Adoption will be and should be a gradual process - and this can be seen through the adoption it has seen in the past few years.

I'm not sure if that was what you were looking for, but Bitcoin Armory ( offers functionality for offline wallets.
The idea is that you have two machines running Bitcoin Armory: one online, blockchain-connected machine that stores no information other than a read-only wallet (let's call it Machine A), and one 'airgapped' offline machine (Machine B) that just holds your private keys. Machine B never touches the internet - it shouldn't even be physically connected to it.
Machine A holds a read-only copy of your wallet - that is, a wallet that only has the public keys. When you want to spend Bitcoins, the client on Machine A creates a new unsigned transaction for the specified amount and address, and stores this on for example a USB thumbdrive.
You then plug your thumbdrive into Machine B - which holds the private keys - and load the transaction into the client on there. It 'signs' the transaction (thereby making it valid) and stores the signed transaction on your thumbdrive. You then plug it back into Machine A, which broadcasts it to the network.
Basically, Machine B only acts as a signing device, and never sees either the blockchain or the internet at all. The only possible attack vector in this situation would be something that autoruns from your thumbdrive and invisibly carries over your private keys [EDIT: or a physical attacker] - but aside from being quite hard to pull off, it's also easy to mitigate by disabling autorunning from USB devices.
Note that Bitcoin Armory also has a bunch of features for true offline wallets (as do a few other clients), where you can for example print out QR codes for your addresses, then destroy the local wallet, and keep the printed QR codes in a secure storage (such as a vault). This, however, means you cannot spend any of the Bitcoins in the addresses.

Ironically, an analogy can be made to Bitcoin mining here. It seems like you can earn more by mining in a pool than by mining solo, when in reality you're just distributing the rewards differently. Over a long enough period of time, the rewards from both methods are about equivalent.
The same thing applies to centralizing your security into one large pool - which is essentially what you're doing. Individual instances of a "compromise" may seem less common, but *when* it happens it's on a much larger scale. Over time, it evens out to pretty much the same amount of damage.
