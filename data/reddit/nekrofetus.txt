Yeah, its been two days with no further help though. They said they forwarded the case to a specialist or something
@_date: 2019-03-03 13:22:09
Nice one, i never really thought about this.
Is it only the seller of bitcoins that can be a victim or could i as a buyer of bitcoins be scammed via some similar method?

I got a response saying they had put a specialist on the case?
" Hi there,  
 
Thanks for reaching out. I understand your frustrations with this account issue and appreciate your patience.  
 
I’ve documented the information you’ve provided and have escalated this  case to a specialist. We will follow-up with you as soon as we have an  update. "
What does that even mean, just close the account!
@_date: 2019-03-16 13:15:36
You can make a channel from your android eclair wallet to your full node and send payments via that one. I know eclair will soon release a version of the mobile wallet that can receive transactions as well.

I've tried bisq and localbitcoins. They both worked!
Bisq is better anonymity but worse liquidity. Its very cool, i hope it will grow.
Anyway: I cant even delete my coinbase account which is my problem at the moment. I have no dust left but i still cannot close the account.
@_date: 2019-03-02 11:15:34
Is there any good guide for doing this on windows?
@_date: 2019-03-26 20:31:50
Well spoken!
@_date: 2019-03-02 00:58:12
I refreshed and clicked the close account button a bunch of times as well as relogged twice. Still couldnt close it. Any other ideas?

Hm i actually have no idea. Btw, Bisq is great!

K will try that later. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-03-02 18:38:32
Haha. I got an identical response today and now i could close my account. This problem is obviously not new or unique. Either way, good riddance!
@_date: 2019-03-03 14:33:04
Yeah, i thought the same. Ty!

@_date: 2019-02-28 22:47:02
I actually did but i can't close it anyway.
@_date: 2019-02-19 22:00:07
Actually it is implemented. Just buy via localbitcoins, bisq or maybe others. The BTC you buy will have no connection to your name. If you want to you can use Wasabi wallet to mix your coins as well.
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:31:42
I want to delete my account but i literally cannot do it for some reason.
All my wallets are empty and show green check marks when i go to the close account page. 
But when i try to close i get the message: 
" You can't complete the account closure quite yet. "
Surely they are not so incompetent that they try to prevent their users from closing accounts? I doubt that would be legal, especially under GDPR..
If anyone knows a solution to this, please let me know.
@_date: 2019-02-28 22:46:33
Yeah i saw that, but i have no dust and i still cant close it.
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:08:32
Yeah there's not a single satoshi or anything left, even coinbase themselves acknowledges that the wallets are empty. But i still cannot close the account. : /

Hey well done finding this post then. I am running two LN nodes over tor on windows atm : )
There is a link to the standalone tor executable if you go to the "advanced" section or something similar on the torbrowser download page, so you do not need the browser. After that you just need a few lines in the torrc config file and the lnd.conf files and you're good to go!
Try it out and ask here or in DM if you need more help!
@_date: 2019-04-01 17:13:09
I would say get it right straight of the bat and go with hodlhodl or bisq. Buy from your peers with venmo/bank transfer/paypal/cash without placing your personal information OR your bitcoin in anyone elses care. Exchanges can get hacked which means you can loose both your funds and your personal information. With the two alternatives i mentioned, the funds are stored in your own wallet, and no KYC is required.
If you do use a more conventional exchange, just make sure to not leave your coins there but withdraw them to your own wallet as soon as possible.

I feel the pain of anyone who lost funds. Never leave your funds anywhere but in your own safe storage.
I have to recommend anyone looking for alternatives to use Bisq instead of LBC as it provides mostly the same features as LBC but without risking your funds and in a more private manner.
Instead of storing your BTC on someone else's site, it stays in your client (with seed word and backup possibilities). Instead of risking 2fa/sms/whatever login, you access your peers through a tor network using the client.
The only downside is that its not as popular yet, but it works very well and should grow fast.

Thank you! !lntip 66
 I am running eclair at the moment and it seems to be working well. It cannot be minimized to task tray but other than that it is exactly what i wanted. If anyone wants to try opening a channel to me, or wants help to run eclair with a full node on windows 10, just let me know!
My node URI: 020d98c2ccc70c6e19d445a55791cd0caa98049af479ae59bea2c65cdde9f61978

Nice, but it should be quick.
I've done maybe 5 transactions on chain last week, all with 3 satoshi/byte fees. All of them got confirmed within 20 minutes.
If you want instant payments, try setting up a lightning wallet like eclair for android. If he accepted that, he would get the tip instantly and almost no fee for you.
@_date: 2019-01-26 17:17:35
Is the fee big to do something like this? Is it complicated?
Maybe in the future all wallets will have features like this and bitcoin will be truly fungible, like cash is.
@_date: 2019-01-27 16:20:31
If its less than say 200$ of funds i would go only with a mobile hot wallet, that way you don't have to keep track of several different wallet applications.
I think electrum for android is a good one with a good reputation.
If its more than that i would go for a PC electrum client set up in an offline environment with seed word backup.
If its more than 1k$ i would get a hardware wallet (trezor or ledeger) and use with the electrum client.
If you want to help the bitcoin network and have hard drive space to spare, run bitcoin core on your PC and become part of the network by running a full node!
@_date: 2018-04-13 06:12:59
The data directory is not the default location, rather : 
D:\Full node\Bitcoin\blockchain
In the EPS config.cfg file i just wrote:
datadir = D:\Full node\Bitcoin\blockchain
Thoughts about this?
Also, im not sure what to put in the other fields in the [bitcoin-rpc]
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:23:15
Yes the Electrum thing solved itself so it was probably totally unrelated to this.
But i still cannot run start-server.bat for the same reason. Could it be due to the space sign i have in the data dir location? I see the .cookie file there so it definitely exists.
I see that there seems to be another method than using the .cookie file (Setting up RPC u/p). But with my limited knowledge I'm not sure what to put there.
My bitcoin full node is currently accepting incoming connections via the default port (8333), on the same PC as i want EPS running.
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:05:07
I really like the sound of this but I'm not super experienced yet. Trying to set up a full node, use it for my own wallet and learn something new as well. But i Ran into some problems.
I have bitcoin core running and inbound connections are accepted. I downloaded the release of EPS and started in the config file, but when i try to run start-server.bat i get the error: unable to find .cookie file, try setting 'datadir' config.
I did fill in the datadir field but maybe i did it in the wrong format? 
Also it seems that my electrum wallet is no longer synchronising to the other servers, even though i didnt change any settings in electrum yet? (Red network sign)

I'm prepared to put some funds on there just for fun. Maybe 50-100$ or something. But i want it to be a software client, i don't want to buy a Casa or a  raspberry pi and have that laying around in my house. Any suggestions for that?
@_date: 2018-12-30 11:54:38
I see these suggestions are popular. But why is it that most suggest that i use a stand-alone device for my LN node?
I'm already running my PC 24/7 with the bitcoin node, I'd rather not have an additional device in the house just for LN. I want a software client that i can run next to bitcoin core, minimized in my task tray. Does it exist?
@_date: 2018-12-30 11:58:39
It looks cool, but if possible i would avoid having an additional device as i am already running my PC as a server and don't want more clutter in the house.
Any software that can help me set up a node in a somewhat smooth way on windows?
@_date: 2018-12-30 12:01:31
It seems casa hodl and the raspberry bolt are both good solutions. But i would prefer something which does not require an extra connected hardware device in my house. What about Zap and similar wallet software? I think if there is just a single program i can download that lets me open and close channels, and configure basic routing options, while sitting minimized in my task tray next to bitcoin core the rest of the time, that's what i want.
Maybe it doesnt exist yet?
@_date: 2018-12-30 11:57:17
Thats how i believed it was as well.
But i know the LN node is connected to the bitcoin full node right, to watch the blockchain in some matter? But it cannot differentiate between the UTXOs that are "mine" and others?
