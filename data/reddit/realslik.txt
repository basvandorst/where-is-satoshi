In the future if it becomes feasible to make them with nuclear reactors or with quantum physics, gold could get close to 0. I heard there's an asteroid with an estimated quadrillion usd worth of gold.

In calculus nothing ever goes to zero, it infinitely approaches it ��

We definitely do need it. I vote for the ⚡ You guys need to understand the psychology of it; many people will feel better buying and spending satoshis than fractions of btc. Can't tell you how many times I had to explain this to people and then go on to speak of inflation and % of currency supply

First of all I know calculus so you can stop before you even get started. Second, you need to accept the fact that the world's population is mostly stupid. A good "business" understands this and caters accordingly. If the whole world was smart they wouldn't even use fiat in the first place. If you don't understand that, you shouldn't be involved in the space.

Guys why haven't we all agreed upon the lightning bolt yet? It's clean and illustrates the fact that it's an electronic currency, plus we have the lightning network. I don't wanna see any @ signs or other terrible ideas... ⚡ the satoshi.

I would like to buy some. It's history and some day a museum will buy it off me for bitcoin.

Not gonna lie, I knew about the federal reserve and the debt based economy before I got into bitcoin but I just kinda thought that's the way it's gotta be and at least the economy was growing. I'm not saying btc will be the "golden bullet" but I have no doubt it will have its place in the future and the technology it inspires will certainly address issues with our current system.

Lmfao at you criticizing me for "supposedly" learning everything from YouTube and then you coming here and posting articles from business insider? Locking your money up in T-bills means it is effectively not able to be spent until time has psssed so you are basically sacrificing your capital to avoid inflation. Stocks are not equivalent to the "dollar" and businesses can easily do commerce in any number fiat currencies or perhaps even in bitcoin. Seriously man, post some scientific peer reviewed sources or GTFO. You literally have no idea what you're talking about and I think it's becoming obvious to everyone that you're a 17 year old troll. Shouldn't you be in class? You certainly need to be.

Lmfaooo! You're awfully ignorant and narrow minded but I like your style so I'll actually leave a response. Where should we start? Perhaps with gold, the oldest form of money. What gives gold value? Nothing really, except the fact that we all agree it has value. There is very little industrial use and it currently holds its spot because we simply agree that it should. There are metals that are more rare and valuable but they aren't gold because they don't have the same notoriety or recognition. Now we move onto reserve currencies or as us crypto enthusiasts like to call them, "fiat currencies". They are no longer backed by gold but merely debt, and faith in the nations issuing them. If you believe this faith is unwavering think again. The United States has many enemies that would love to see the dollar fall. What you say is true currently; demanding all of the debt would crash the system and likely cause suffering for all, but if done slowly, the USD would endure a slow and gradual decline until it no longer is the standard. Countries like Russia, China and Iran are not fond of the US, and do not appreciate the sanctions being cast onto them. Even though we all know dollars have no intrinsic value or scarcity, they have worked pretty well so far because bartering in gold would be a major hassle. But now we have crypto.. Immutable, secure, robust and unaffiliated with any nation state politics. Everything is speculation, including holding onto USD; its just that bitcoin has everything to gain and the USD has everything to lose. I'm actually very knowledgeable about economics and I understand the benefits of inflation.. As well as the crippling consequences. If you can't understand this then you along with many others will lose much of your purchasing power due to blind faith in a system that you seem to know very little about and have no control over. Anyways, hope you learned something, you're life savings may depend on it. Cheers ��

Funny how you mentioned that bitcoin has crashed 8 times but forgot to mention the part where it rebounded and went parabolic never to return to those prices again. I would call you a pleb in the system, but frankly you don't seem intelligent enough to be hired as one. Is "cringe worthy" the extent of your vocabulary?  You really do need to be in English class�� 
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:07:07
Lol you mad? My bad for schooling you like this but if you're gonna try to talk shit at least get your facts straight to save yourself from looking like a fool. I think I honestly gave you too much credit. All of the "facts" you  just pulled out of your ass were false and you can barely even spell properly. You clearly don't understand the psychology of economics at all and cattle was not "money" it was used in barter, understand the difference. You should be paying me for tutoring you right now my time is limited. Pick up a book, read more and talk less.

LOOL. Well seeing as you are in the bitcoin subreddit I presume you understand that the entire world is currently in a global debt crisis. Obviously those who have the least power and influence will succumb first. Be patient and soon you will see many other countries unable to repay debts and  collapse as a result. Tbh even if all the countries in the "dark corners" of the world were to start using btc which is arguably a decent percentage of the world, btc could still double in value. Long term, western nations will get behind it because there's more profit to be made than in trying to destroy something that can't be destroyed.
