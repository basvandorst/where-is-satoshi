Its called a bubble, genious. And has he noticed the upward trend? It always "crashed" to something higher than before.
What he wants to say is that it can be volatile and that you shouldnt buy in times of a bubble.

Life in prison, come on you can literally kill children and you will get the same sentence in many countries of the world. (Some US states maybe not)
In Germany you can kill somebody and you will get out in 15 years.
To me it doesnt really make sense to pile up the years from the supposed crimes that you commited or helped to make happen.
I think people did not donate more than $600 because they think the guy must be rich, which they at least say is not true.

I never looked it up on SR but was that even on there? I could imagine it was banned Im also not sure if weapons where on there all the time.

That's what I thought immediately, are they betting on falling btc prices? But then again what would the company gain

Any idea where I can change bitcoins in europe with my bank account?
Bitstamp wants documents that I just cannot provide

Uncertainty is good because Im hoping to be there in the "under the mean phase".

I did not sell because I figured Im simply too late to profit from the drop in any meaningful way.
Even though I believe that technical analysis and looking at past patterns does not really work I whish I had put in a stop order at around 1000 € because in retrospect it looks like a bubble.

I guess they insta-flip it but thats just risk aversion, they could keep it a month and get rich just as well as lose money.
Same as if I say I accept dollars here or euros or whatever. I will make or lose small amounts of money if I dont exchange it the same day.

If I liquidated my bitcoins then I would have to pay some kind of tax on yields from shares or something like that, correct? What do you mean by hodling for one year? 
@_date: 2018-11-03 17:20:22
Not saying you're wrong but that would mean you could make insane earnings from btc completely tax free. It could be a million for example thats hard to believe.
How do I proof that it's me who put the money into the wallet? I could white wash any amount by saying I put in x amount in 2010 and these are my earnings now. Maybe a whole different problem but still

Better than those government bonds my parents bought me. Couldnt touch them for 18 years for what? 10 percent.
On the other hand we'll have to see about BTCs performance over 18 years, a lot of things can happen. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:22:59


My parents told me that I cant have anything ever because it costs money and they cant send me to work because its illegal. So I had to be poor.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:57:56
Well, its just completely random volatility (+ market manipulation)
and the more choices you make the more likely it is you are wrong.
With BTC you have to stay with it for at least a year because the trend has always been up.
With all my stupid buying and selling I lost so much money in opportunity cost that instead of a nice new car today I can buy a 5 year old used car. Hooray...

Even if I had made 10 bucks into 1k I would not have bitcoin as my licence plate.

I cant think about the opportunity costs of the shit I bought it makes me sick.
I could probably buy a mercedes if I had held these coins.

Watching the changes all day will make you more impulsive in buying and selling. At least thats how I lost a lot of money. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:18:24
That is a variable that the fed controls for quite a while. It makes sense to use this to deflate a bubble for example. When you let the market do this then the bubble is bigger and also the fall afterwards. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 08:28:28
How do you control the interest rate without the fed being able to control the money supply? 
I agree that cdo, cds, subprime mortgages should have been regulated but that's being captain hindsight really. 
Why they let the interest rate go so low? I guess Bernanke thought inflation would be a greater evil. 
@_date: 2016-05-30 08:57:19
Do you think technical analysis works with bitcoin?

@_date: 2015-03-23 09:10:05
Yes let's invest in technology like phones etc that lose value as we speak good idea, not stupid at all. 
It still has nothing to do with inflation but everything with irrational behavior. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:19:52
If the money devalues why doesn't this show in the inflation index?

When you burn a small amount of data on a cd then only the inner ring looks different. So while there might be some amount of error correction its not burned on there 100x redundantly.
If you create the same wallet file 500x with a slightly different filename then yes saving on cd is only half stupid.
He probably did not do that.
Hes likely just fucking around and wrote "100 BTC" on some old CD

I think I formatted what was 15€ back then on my phone. That was like 1 coin.
I will never put coins on my phone anymore anytime soon or only small amounts for practical reasons.

I'm not sure why western union charges so much because for that money you could send it physically with express and insurance. 
I aso don't see what the extra service for this btc company in the thread is. Basically you need an exchange service in country 1 and then the workers can send the btc around the world and then you need an exchange in country 2.
All it would costs would be fees and unfavorable exchange rates. 
Maybe that's a bit much to ask from normal people but a service doing all of that is not really needed. 
What's positive for the company using btc is that they don't have to deal with other banks and that the sending costs next to nothing.

Is multibit really offline? I wondered a while ago but did not look it up. 
I use it so I dont have to download 12gig. That still means its offline right? Sorry for stupid question, tired. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:15:37
I liquidated this time and will be back next year or so hopefully for a lower price.

It would even be safer putting it into a truecrypt container and putting this into a dropbox for convenience, still not very smart to put it online but people cant access it that easily.
Would the problem be using that blockchain sit at all?
I remember using it for a specific problem but I dont remember what it was, in general Id save the bitcoins that I get from the site I bought them to my pc.

They are scumbags (paypal) however from a consumers point of view its a nice service because I can get my money back.
But when looking at the big picture I think that Bitcoin is really great and Id use it for non-physical goods like downloaded games etc and for donations.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:53:25
Especially if you want to make a little money with the ups and downs. 
It looks like bitcoin will be big anyways

By bucks I mean dollars and right now it would be more like 500.
I suspect it was one bitcoin, when it was worth $13 at the time.
Because I formatted twice (1x new rom and 2x raspberry pi system) I figured it would be impossible and I did not try. Can something be found when its even different file systems that it was formatted to?
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:40:54
Exactly its not overwritten, the table is erased or something like that.
Its not like its wiped, overwritten with nonsense but the old data can be easily overwritten because its declared "free".
I would have a thousand bucks if I hadent formatted my phone and put a new rom on it.
But I am aware the chances would be extremely slim to find that wallet.
Actually I might have formatted twice so the chances should be zero.
But it would be interesting to know if a tool can find something like that.
@_date: 2013-11-16 10:44:36
And also the prices, this is tea not marijuana. You allready cut out the middle man and now you still want to rip me off?
Im talking about retail prices why do I see these first, nobody can and will pay 8$ for 15g whats the reasoning behind that? (People will close your site on seeing this)
People should see the wholesale prices first. 
Is there a minimum for wholesale that I have to order and how do I get this through customs? Things from India will be inspected one hundred percent so there should be a bill or customs declaration on the outside.
I dont think this will work just because its fair trade. I can get a kilo of tea for half the price and I will get it in 3 days. With you I will pay 2x + shipping around the world, customs will give me trouble, I get it 2months later and I feel like an idiot. Something will have to change so I can see a benefit for myself
@_date: 2013-08-15 08:09:32
I wouldnt have wanted them in the first place, especially the origin only ones which I can use because I will not install origin

He had this made propbably months before the arrest so he can wear it in the event of DPRs arrest.

Activated them over steam, shame that some are origin only
@_date: 2013-07-04 10:42:26
Lets assume I want to buy weed, its closest to the truth.
But if I change my euros to BTC which takes like 3 days in the time inbetween I can lose like 20% of my money easily.
And if I calculated not enough safety then I cant buy my weed either, thats the problem.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:01:00

@_date: 2013-08-15 10:40:30
I guess that many bitcoin users dont want to use origin and thus dont see a reason to even pay the 5 bucks.
Just like me, I didnt want the games in the first place and now some charity on the other side of the world has my money. (Which is a win for them)
I wouldnt have donated money to them otherwise and EA doesnt make money with this meaning they probably dont have to pay EA money.
@_date: 2013-07-30 18:15:22
