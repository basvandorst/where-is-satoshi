Wow, the big picture is so clear now.

Just how dishonest are you going to be with yourself exactly? Here's Jimmy Song explaining the Segwit consensus upgrade and it's impact on average block size: 
My initial point is still valid. There are times when you are willing to upgrade the consensus rule, even if it does mean that on average the block size will increase. (because yes it did, cut the dishonest bullshit about "base blocksize" what really matters from your Tribes point of view is how large the blockchain becomes because oh God we absolutely need to be able to run a node on a raspberry pi).

Consensus rules are meant to be upgraded
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:27:33
Yup, easily done with dead switch contract and a modified multi sig.

You're such a great example of how perfidious the BTC/BCH/BTG community has become. Have a great day

Nothing in the white paper mentioned artificially throttling the throughput either

Segwit blocks absolutely have a larger base size than pre-segwit blocks. You're probably just too busy keeping the tribal fight alive to even stop to think about the upgrades you do.

What a fucking twat. If that's a $10 word for you no wonder you can't understand the article I linked you. Thanks for reminding me why I stopped hanging around the BTC/BCH subs long time ago. Bunch of losers who aren't technical enough to contribute in any meaningful way so they prefer to take it to Twitter and Reddit to fight for their tribe and throw the "fuck yous" around. I preferred to remain civil but obviously you're too fucking retarded to have an actual conversation.  
Worst part is your too fucking dense to realize you and your type are hurting the community and driving actually productive people away. Hopefully I dumbed this one down enough for you and you won't need a dictionary for this one. I'm still right on my original comment, you did actually change consensus rules last summer and it did actually lead to an increase in average blocksize (but yes not to the "base blocksize" as if the distinction actually mattered in practice). I'm done wasting my time with a moron who's managed to convince himself that he right even if he obviously has no fucking idea how the tech works.

Wow you are gilded! You are so important, this sub would really miss out if you weren't here. You're a 14 year old loser who's only skill is to argue pointless arguments on the internet, doesn't realize his bias (not sure if that's a $10 word for your ignorant ass too) Go do your homework kid, you're useless right now
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:23:27
In what year?
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:56:30
But you upgraded your consensus rule for bigger block last summer no? Also, no need to get aggressive
