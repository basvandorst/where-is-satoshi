No one is forcing the consumer to to buy from anyone. It comes down to choice. They can choose not to do business. The business doesn't have that choice in most cases.
And you are forgetting that the consumer can still take legal action here. Not just pay visa 20 bucks to reverse his transactions.

I don't fully disagree, but the current state is no balance whatsoever for small businesses. They are totally left in the rain when it comes to fraud.
This culture of people not taking responsibility for their own wealth safety and credit card companies using crappy tech needs to end.

I couldn't agree more. this mentality of giving all the burden to the merchant is a joke.

Reputation is a great form of customer protection, if you do your research you will know about scammers, stop relying on babysitters to live.
The real problem is that today all the burden is left on the retailer and if you are a small business you have no leverage with payment processors.
There is a large chunk of the world is completely left out of the economic because of this.
