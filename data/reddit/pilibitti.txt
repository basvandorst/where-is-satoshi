I totally agree. Because of that , something that costs $10k today that will *surely* cost $100k soon enough to beat the rest of the market **without a potential risk proportional to potential returns** cannot exist either. BTC can go to $100k, or a million, or more, sure. But comes with a proportional risk. It is not a mostly risk free way to get 10x gains when you weigh the risks by comparing it to other similar options in the market as a whole. Or else, it would be the definition of free lunch.
For instance you can bet that US dollar will lose 1% value before gaining 1% value and use 10x leverage. It is not more riskier than hodling $10k bitcoins hoping to sell them for $100k in a timeframe beating the average market. Just a different instrument.

Maybe in the sub $50 per BTC days, that might have been true. Crypto trading is as frictionless as trading forex and / or stocks for a good while. The only difference is that counterparty risk is significantly higher (scams and / or bankruptcies) which is priced in the "potential risk" I discussed above. I see your point with the "barrier to entry" argument but it just doesn't apply to cryptotrading space right now and it has been that way for a long time. In where I live, trading stocks / forex has a higher barrier to entry than trading BTC, basically.

And that is again, speculation which is what all traders (not just crypto) do. There are infinite scenarios where some of the coins might perform 100x, and another set of infinite scenarios where they might be worth nil tomorrow.

He is sitting on top of it, but that isn't a problem. There are perhaps tens of thousands of bots monitoring the blockchain realtime, waiting to snatch funds sent to addresses with known keys. Really. Try to send btc to a brainwallet created with a couple words from english dictionary; you'll see that the money will be snatched in mere seconds.
If it doesn't end up in btcrobinhood's hands, it WILL end up in someone else's pocket. And regularly it does, btcrobinhood gets lucky only some of the time.
The difference is, from what I see, he is more or less a public figure, and if it is your money, he returns it. I've seen a couple of instances in reddit where someone posts a question about their missing funds from their compromised addresses then it's figured that btcrobinhood has it. In the instances I've seen, he showed up and returned the money in full. If someone else snatched it, they probably wouldn't see a dime of it.
I really don't know who he is, my comments are from the perspective of someone that has seen a couple of instances of the stuff I've written above. So I'm not vouching for him in anyway.
What I'm trying to say is that btcrobinhood is not the only person around getting funds from compromised addresses. Thousands of people have bots doing the very same thing. But if it ends up in his hands and you somehow get in touch with him, you'll probably get your money back.

No economics don't work like that.
If FED says "it will be impossible for USA to create new money after 2030, the amount of USD in the world will remain fixed", you don't see its effects reflected in the market in 2030. You see it today, the second those words are uttered (and it would be catastrophic).
Also bitcoin creation rate is not linear. As years pass, created BTC will be negligible. 80% of all BTC has already been mined.
This all "hold and it will raise in value making us rich" craze is the prime example of it. It is exactly the inverse of what you would want in a functioning economy (if everyone started accepting BTC today, would you use it? who here doesn't know the 10k BTC pizza? who wants to be that guy?). People think it will be rare (practically fixed) and valuable so they hold onto it. You can't have an economy with people holding their money. That attitude of the people is what we call "economic crisis" to begin with. Since 2008 crash, USA is trying to *create* inflation (2% target), all the recovery is focused on that, because you *need* it for recovery. When you are in a deflationary risk, creating inflation is fucking hard.

You need to think bigger. Loans do not exist only for houses.
Think of a town. There is a profitable business. Needs a factory and an office building. Will employ hundreds of people.
Now normally, you'd take a loan, start building immediately, once done set up the business, employ people, make money in the business and pay your loans from the revenue you generate and at the same time employ people.
In your model... You sit and save (with what?) and after decades and decades, you save enough to build the factory... Then... Oh the town is long gone.

Doesn't matter, wages will steadily drop as the value increases. So additional interest will be paid because they'll need to work harder and harder to pay back.
And don't forget the risk premiums. You can't seize bitcoin without owner's cooperation, so if you lend money to someone and that person decides not to pay back, you are SOL. Your only leverage is debtor's prison which doesn't make economical sense and you still won't have your money back. And depending on the size of the loan, unless you prison someone for life, they may be ahead when they get out. So they HODL and do nothing in prison. When they are out, they have money! It's like they paid their loan without working. This will have repercussions in the economy as a whole.
So to mitigate that risk of not ever recovering your loan, your risk premiums (added interest) needs to be through the roof to break even. Every loan is a high risk loan, basically.

professional traders are not emotional about investing and they have no emotional attachment to the things they trade. this is essential for them to filter the bullshit out because anything guided by emotions in trading is *the* recipe for ruin. I know traders that don't trade their own country's currency or stocks for companies that they actually like in a "human" manner because they think that will cloud their judgement and introduce bias.
so traders specialising in bull markets, just switch the things they trade - or pay attention to others that they keep an eye on. There is no shortage of bull markets across countless number of commodities, currencies, stocks etc.
They don't hodl because hopefully they already are out of the market a little bit before the end of the bull market. So if they are successful, they won't have anything to hodl to begin with. The HODL meme is devastating particularly because it spreads emotional investing as a meme to a large community.

And it would be a fallacy without further testing. If you can't repeat it, it is luck.
20 times all heads isn't even that astronomically improbable. That's why intuition with these matters is very prone to being wrong. If everyone on earth flipped fair coins 20 times in a row now, 7500 would get the same face in a row. If they thought it wasn't random as you claim they should do, all of their intuition would be wrong. Yours is also wrong.
There are lotteries with worse odds, and some people win them. They buy the ticket thinking they have realistic odds of winning. When they win, it is random. What they think doesn't change that.
OP had a 1.1% compounded profits on average for 8 months. As I said earlier, NO ONE on earth sustainably made those returns trading **anything**. Never in the history of mankind. If you make those returns, you *should* think it is due to luck, and not what you thought you did. Because if you continue doing it, you'll lose. And that's what happened to OP.

This too is a fallacy. Whales won't care if it goes up or down, they can still make money. They are not emotional about price. A whale or a group of whales can slowly build a short position, then set a trap at a price, then purposefully "poof" the wall and drive the price lower and lower and their older short positions will gain more and more money.
The direction doesn't really matter.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:10:19
That is the problem of this mentality. You made those bets because they made sense to you at the time. Now you think it was a bad mistake *because you lost*. If things went your way, you'd see it as "I saw an opportunity and grabbed it".
That is how you see your past wins, you think "well obviously I won so I must be doing something right". You are unable to separate luck from educated guesses. It is very rare that you'd think "shit I pushed buy when I meant to push sell but it went my way by luck". No, if you place an order you wanted and it goes your way, you'll naturally think "I was right" which may or may not be true.
Find an order history from somewhere, and if you know a bit of computer programming, program a bot that trades randomly, optionally with leverage. They should trade coin tosses without any analysis. You'll see that, especially if you use leverage, a small portion of them will get very very rich before losing it all. Most of them (the percentage of "most" will depend on your average leverage) will lose all very quick but *some* of them, by pure dumb luck, will get ridiculously rich before losing it all. This is math, statistics. There is a non-negligible chance that you could have traded with coin tosses for the last few months and gotten very rich.
Now imagine if those random bots were humans. They'd have a *story*. They'd say "man I was going great, I guessed many things right, I was reading the market, I got rich from almost nothing" and then they'll find an excuse for their losses. Like how they weren't disciplined enough, distracted, got greedy, yaddayadda.
The sooner you accept that your gains were due to luck (and due to trading in a bull market) the sooner you'll recover.

And as you were writing that, that wall was breached.
Don't trust orderbooks.


BTC is down 60% from ATH. If you don't call that dramatic, I don't know what is.
Again, BTC can go above 8000 later so no issues there. My point is, don't trust the buy / sell walls or the order books. There are hidden orders, and there are spoofs / spoofers. You can't look at a huge wall and say "no way that wall is toppling, I'll get my free money". If that held true more than 50% of the time (or proved false more than 50% of the time) everyone would have infinite money. The order books (not just in crypto, but all markets, even government bond markets) are a poker table. And spoofs etc. are illegal in non-crypto markets, even then they are there. Always. In crypto, the issue is worse because it isn't illegal.
As I write this, we are at $7900. That wall is gone.

Suppose you have 1BTC in an exchange. I tell the exchange "I have a feeling that at $18k, BTC is overvalued right now. Give me 1BTC (exchange gives me your BTC) so I can sell it now and buy it back to give it to you when the price dips. Here is my collateral in case anything goes wrong." Exchange says ["k"]( and gives me 1BTC to sell, and I sell it at $18k. If I'm right and the price dips, I buy back 1BTC for, say $10k later and give it back. I pocket the $8k difference.
Of course I animated all to show the basic mechanics, in reality, you just put a sell order. This is called shorting. Exchange already has your collateral, so if you think X will go down, you just submit a sell X order to the exchange and close the order when you think you are done.
Of course if you are wrong, and price rises, you have to buy back the BTC by giving more money from your own pocket, which becomes your loss. Exchange uses your collateral money to fund this. If your losses come dangerously close to your available collateral, the exchange will automatically close the order (buy back the BTC using money from your collateral as if you yourself closed the trade) and ask you to fund your account.

No, gamble and risk are not the same things, though everything involves risk - and gambling does too.
Gambling is the activities comprised of a specific subset of risk taking where you are partaking in activities with the hope of getting ahead even though statistically you are likely to lose given the data.
So with gambling, the odds must dictate that by merely participating in it, in the long run, you are more likely to lose (a statistical certainty) though there will still be some winners by sheer luck. And you partake with the hope that you will be in the winners bucket even though statistically it is more likely for you to be in the losers bucket in the end.
Most gamblers and gambling addicts are not smart enough to do the above maths though and think that they know something that most other people can't see - so they play / invest because they think they are smart and the rest of the world is stupid. They think they found a loophole, free lunch. You'll see that most gamblers are also conspiracy theorists because they share the same trait: They feel that they can see and understand things most people in the world can't see or understand. A sheer underestimation of the collective power of billions of people's survival instincts and a sheer overestimation of their own intelligence.
And it is not just the instrument that defines what is gambling and what is not though, also it is how you use it.
For instance, partaking in a a fair coin flip game with "lose all or win double" is not gambling by itself. You have 50% chance of losing your money and 50% chance of doubling it. Statistically, it is neutral. You are not expected to lose or win except for your time of course. In the long run, you'll break even.
If you decide to bet using the martingale system (doubling down after each loss) with the above game however, you are statistically expected to lose your shirt (unless you have infinite money). So you are gambling. 
If you are buying US treasury bonds for the little return they will provide, well it is a risk but an insignificant one. You are betting that the USA will exist when it is time to get your returns. It is a risk but an insignificant one.
If you invest in bitconnect, if you do the math, you will know that it can't work and you are certainly going to lose. You can't just invest in bitconnect because everything in life is a risk. There has been people that cashed out more than they put in in bitconnect, but an overwhelming majority of people lost.
In the markets, the potential returns are **always** proportional to the risk. So when investing in anything, if you can't figure out how much you can lose and how fast, just look at how much you expect to win. The higher it is, that automatically means the more likely you are expected to lose it all.
Some risk taking is in gambling territory. If you are "investing" in something with odds that majority of participants are going to lose - you are gambling.

So you don't have a stoploss. You don't have a trading plan if you don't have goals based on a risk reward ratio for a particular trade. Your risk is infinity and reward is less than infinity. So it's not a trading plan. "Adoption is 100% certain" is result of an emotional response. Market doesn't agree with you or it would have been priced in.
And even if the adoption of the *ideas* that made bitcoin a reality is a certainty, it surely isn't certain that *bitcoin* is the one that will bring those ideas to the market with the fewest downsides.

Yes, we call that economic crisis. Lending stops and economy halts. People hoard, businesses go bankrupt and unemployment rises.
To make lending / borrowing attractive again, we make hodling expensive (0 or negative interest rates) so that economy can function again. People lend / invest instead of hodling so that there are jobs again and a positive feedback loop occurs to have a functioning economy.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:07:37
It needs a stable price and a very slight inflation to be used. Price isn't important. It can be $1, or it can be $100k, as long as it is stable and doesn't encourage hoarding, it can be used. If those don't happen, it won't be used.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:59:10
You are getting it.
Bitcoin is deflationary. Deflation in an economy is the worst thing you can have. Search for deflationary spiral.
You can't have a deflationary currency. Period. A functioning economy needs modicum amount of inflation to work. People should think their money will slightly be devalued if you hold onto them without investing or using it. That is the "electricity" of a functioning economy. That's what makes it *run*. People buying goods (or investing in things). Buying goods generates profits. Profitable companies employ people. Employed people get money. Then they spend that money.
If people think their buying power will increase with "hodling", the economy collapses into a deflationary spiral. 
There are countries (like Japan) trying to devalue their currency and failing at it (there are signs of life after trying for 3 decades, Japan stock market ATH is in 1989, think about it, it crashed and never recovered, still about half the value of ATH right now). Deflationary spiral is the worst.
The idea of decentralized *anything* is interesting. For money, deflation cannot be hardcoded into it. Otherwise it can't work as a currency in the long term and it is poised to be a speculation device which is what we are seeing with bitcoin.
Future's decentralised money, if it will exist, must not have deflation built in and needs to have a solution for ensuring price stability (which is the job of central banks now, so it needs a decentralised solution). 
When that "coin" arrives, no one will see it as an "investment opportunity" or "get rich quick" device. They'll *just use it*. Because you don't invest in a currency. If you feel the need to invest in a currency, that means it will fail to be a currency.

You can't know that.
Think about it, you are a new trader. You do lots of research, you watch news and charts. You make $100k - $200k (depending on price) in a few months.
Is it... that easy? Do you think that you found a very clever way to make money that most of the world don't know about? Can't learn about? People spend their years in schools, in gruesome jobs just to make a quarter of that money in a year. Hedge funds ran by phds in all things economics struggling to get 10% returns exploting any and all inefficiencies in markets and you made 1500% in a few months. You, a new comer, found *something* that beats the collective intelligence of billions of people?

That's a fair point. I was talking from a trading perspective because I assumed OP was asking about such a context, talking about bulls and bears. Still, HODL is confusing - when people ask for advice about price changes, no one says "HODL unless you are a trader", they just say HODL. Traders should not hodl. Traders should remove emotional attachments etc. and do their trades based on data and analysis.
In any case though, even for people with dreams of widespread adoption, there should be a limit for emotional investment. Decentralised money is a very interesting idea, and we don't yet exactly know how to do it right. While bitcoin is the *original* idea and has first mover's advantage, there is no reason to believe that the developers behind bitcoin will always get it right and make it the best digital currency. The landscape *might* change. Bitcoin was invented (as far as we know) by one person. He is not the only person capable of making technological strides (although such people are rare.) There *is* a possibility that bitcoin might be left behind - there *are* problems to be solved and someone else (or some other group) might suddenly / gradually come up with solutions that make it more suitable to what bitcoin aims to be - with fewer downsides.
I like what bitcoin aims to be. But I don't particularly care which "coin" makes it work. It might be bitcoin in the end, or something else not even existing right now. So hodling investors (not traders) should still watch the landscape. If they look back, they probably fell in love with the *idea* of what bitcoin aims to be and not the name bitcoin itself. So if such a time comes that there is a competitor poised to the job better than BTC then there is no point in hodling BTC, is it? I'm not speculating that this is the case right now but it very well might be. When I learned about bitcoin, it was the only cryptocurrency out there. If I learned about cryptocurrencies today (with no historical context / prices but with current and planned features), bitcoin surely wouldn't stand out to me as the most interesting one or the one with most potential (personally.)

Let me put it in another way, last one I promise:
You think it's not all luck. 
With the profit you made, you made an average of 1.1% compounded profit a day for 8 months.
Think about it, there has been no trader of anything in the history of mankind that managed to **sustainably** make a measly 1% profit a day. Not even close to close. Not even Buffett. Not even any other name you can think of.
If you could sustain such a scheme, with $1000 initial capital and 1% average profit a day (less than you made, this is what bitconnect, davor and alike promise btw), in 10 years, you'd have: five quintillion, nine hundred twenty-nine quadrillion, four hundred forty-eight trillion, five hundred seventy-two billion, sixty-nine million, three hundred sixty-eight thousand dollars.
More than the total money in the universe I suppose.
Do the math and you'll see how *lucky* you were. Not how talented or hardworking. You were at the right place at the right time. Took a bet and it worked. These don't come often. That's why you eventually lose. You think it's *what you did* made it work where it hasn't. So you try to do it again to get more obviously but surprise! It doesn't work. Because it wasn't what you did that made it work. You were lucky. For once.

You don't have a stoploss at zero. You just don't have a stoploss. There is no difference between not having a stoploss and having a stoploss at zero.
So that is not a trading plan. When I buy a lottery ticket, I automatically set my stoploss at zero (meaning I don't have a stoploss). I don't think of myself as a trader when I buy one.
Betting and trading are different things.
Full time profitable traders don't trade like "I'll let this go until I'm in the green - or nothing". Every trade counts.

You gambled. You are / were a gambler.




And worse, you learned the wrong fucking lessons. You were just like another gambler in the roulette or blackjack table. The accuracy of your predictions are imaginary. "It went this way too long, that can't happen, bound to reverse" heuristic is simple and just the recipe for loss.
And just like a gambler, you chased your losses, and lost again. If you find money and try to recoup your "initial investment", you'll lose it again. Again and again. Until you realize that you are approaching everything with a gambler's mindset.
Don't forget, when you lose even 50%, you need to make 100% just to break even. When you lose %75, you need to see 400% returns to break even. With desperation, astrology and confusing random guesses with trading knowledge, there is no chance that you are sustaining those gains. With dumb luck, you'll make something, and if you continue, you'll lose it all again and again.
If you feel like doing this again, stop and look for resources regarding gambling addiction.

Why do I lend the money I get from you to anyone? I need the money to get a factory built. I'll give it to people to build the factory and they'll buy apples with it and eat it.




Why do you not need me to pay you back? Instead of me lending your money, why don't you just lend it directly to others? Forcing me to lend money I get from you to others serves no purpose, makes no sense, and you don't benefit from it directly or indirectly anyways.

Doesn't mean that it can't recover later in a more healthy fashion, but also doesn't mean that it will recover. In any case, the touching $20k phase was indeed a bubble, and it popped. Time will tell what will happen next, bitcoin had a few other bubbles and pops earlier in its life.

Investing is either "buying" a piece of a company, or founding a company. It is "buying". My point is that people don't do that in deflationary economies. You expect your purchasing power to increase if you just hold onto your money, why would you invest in companies or found companies in an economic climate where people don't spend money besides the bare minimum? In a deflationary spiral people will  neglect their wants and focus on their minimal needs. Are you disputing this simple economic fact that is not just theoretical nonsense but seen over and over again in countries that experienced deflation? In a deflationary spiral people are out of jobs, or scared to death of being out of jobs - they don't buy phones they don't need, and they don't subscribe the cable if they can help it. You are giving examples from an inflationary economy, you probably grew up in one and never experienced deflation in real life so I can see how you can't imagine it.
A simple thought experiment for you: If cryptocurrencies had NO adoption problems, and a store offered the same goods for the same price both in USD and BTC, which one would you spend? If you are rational, you'd spend your USD and not BTC because USD lives in an inflationary economy and BTC lives in a deflationary bubble. If that store accepted only BTC, it would be harder for you to part with your BTC mentally because you expect BTC price to increase. You can buy more with it tomorrow. Spending USD is easier because you expect it to buy less tomorrow.
Now, if you didn't have the USD option and lived in a deflationary economy, then all the people around you would share a similar mindset, revenues would drop all around, unemployment would rise and it is called "deflationary spiral" because insecurity about jobs make people spend less, and when people spend less revenues drop and when revenues drop unemployment rises and... you get the point. It is survival time, not "wants" time.
Investing in that climate is stupid because everything you can "invest in" (buy) with your money will lose value whereas your money is expected to increase in value. Just go read the wiki article I linked about deflation above.

What does this have to do with lending?
You're saying that someone will loan 50btc to someone else with the *hope* that they will be paid 45btc in 30 years. Can you hear how ridiculous this sounds?
Do you hold any BTC? Would you give me a bit of your BTC now? I'l pay 95% of it back to you next year, I promise. This is called gig economy, a new paradigm.

You mean, like, the great depression? Observable deflation, for any country, is an extreme economic crisis.
@_date: 2019-09-30 07:43:34
Dude, deflation for any economy is a crisis. It is survival mode. I don't see how you don't get it. It is when stock market tanks, and unemployment rises to unacceptable levels. You're talking about investments in such an environment like everything is normal. What you are suggesting is like selling hair combs during doomsday.

Oh really? Please show me an example of prospering deflationary economy so I can have a taste of that empirical evidence. I'll make it easier for you: it doesn't have to be current. Show me any example of any country / group of people freely prospering in a deflationary economic environment (today or in documented history). I'll wait.
The reality is from experience that we empirically know uncontrolled inflation is horrible (believe me I'd know, I grew up with 90% inflation and it wasn't even particularly one of the worst examples - people would spend their entire paycheck on the way home to get maximum value out of their money). Deflation is horrible (and is harder to get out of once it happens, dealing with hyperinflation is easier if the country act rationally, but getting out of deflation is a lot harder). And we know that controlled and "natural" inflation creates countries and economies that prosper and advance. If you have counterexamples, I'm happy to hear you out.

That is the point, if the economy is deflationary, that means your money gains purchasing power faster than any investments you can reasonably make.


This is from inflationary economy again, does not work that way with deflation. In a deflationary environment there is no stable / growing demand to anything besides basic necessities.


All the reasonable people hoping to have a shot at retirement *do* invest today. Because they lose purchasing power otherwise. If you are making average amounts of money but sitting on top of it doing nothing with it, you are losing purchasing power every second. People buy property. (In the context of USA, I'm not from there) People have 401k, interest gaining saving accounts, money in the stock market, vanguard, roth ira etc. all are investments - you are funding *something* that hopes to grow and profit directly or indirectly. This only happens if you have some sort of inflation going. If it isn't happening, such investments don't make sense because they are sure to lose value.
People attending to their wants happens in a world you are used to, with healthy amounts of inflation - in a functioning economy. When the economy ceases to function (deflation) it is EMERGENCY mode. It is when companies are bleeding money with mass layoffs, and you are so insecure that you hold onto any amount of cash you can.
I can't really see how you guys are having a very hard time between the basic idea behind inflation vs. deflation. It is really simple and something you experience everyday in your lives. Just think about it which one makes more sense:
You are sick so I offer to mow your lawn **today.** And tell you "hey you owe me one, when you feel better I'd appreciate if you can mow my equally sized lawn". Then life happens we lost touch for, say, 40 years. You never get the opportunity to pay me back for it. 40 years later we meet again. Which one makes more sense?
1. I generated "value" for you 40 years ago. You can pay for that today, but since so much time passed, you need to mow my lawn TWICE. (deflation, the value you provided 40 years ago is worth MORE now)
2. I generated "value" for you 40 years ago. Buy me a beer and let's call it even. (inflation, what you did for him was very much relevant and valuable back then but gradually lost relevance)
There is absolutely ZERO natural reason for the value you generate today to be of more value tomorrow if you do nothing with the returns of such value generation other than sitting on top of it. Is there?
Like do you ever sit and think: I worked today to be able to afford 1 whole chicken to eat. If I sit down and do nothing, I should be able to buy 2 chickens with that money tomorrow. It is my natural right as a value generating person.
Does that make natural sense to you? Because that is what deflationary money promotes. It is against the natural laws of everything known to universe, it doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2019-09-28 22:16:50
Good luck surviving in a deflationary economy. If your BTC will be worth more tomorrow (deflation) why spend it today? If people don't spend beyond basic necessities, how will they make a living? [Deflationary spiral]( is named as such for a reason.
Money NOW has an opportunity cost. There is no reason for the value you generated 20 years ago to have the same purchasing power today. I mean it makes no real sense. It would be nice to have that but it is like... it would be nice to suspend gravity sometimes to have some fun but the natural world doesn't work that way.

The definition of "profitable" is not something that is open to interpretation. It's simple maths. Just like how 2+2=4 isn't open to interpretation. But by now I'm pretty sure you're just delusional or a giant troll so no worries.

Your accountant hopefully knows what a profitable investment is. If you didn't break even (yet) all you have is an investment. We'll see if you actually are profitable when you recoup your investment. You writing "I'm profitable" is simply misleading.

read the wizsec report.
Some of the stolen gox coins were moved directly to btce internal storage without ever hitting customer wallets.
Some of the stolen coins, after going through btce went right back into gox, to wallets controlled by Vinnik.
If Vinnik really is a btce (co)founder then it means him and his company were instrumental in the hack and laundering of some stolen funds.
Reports indicate the person and related wallets were also instrumental on other btc heists.

In terms of mtgox losses, that is pretty much normal. Remember that when mtgox was a thing, people were buying a pizza for 10000BTC to send a message to the public. 200BTC was probably chump change those days depending on when they got in.
@_date: 2017-07-01 13:08:26
Oh my god how can somebody be this dense...
If you have not recouped all the money you put into all your equipment **you are not profitable**. You say your profitability depends on bitcoin's price rising.
So you are not profitable *yet* but you *believe* if things go up, you will end up being profitable.
I don't know if you know nothing about money, investing, or if you are trolling, it's just stupid.
If I buy a stock right now, thinking it will rise, I AM NOT PROFITABLE. I am profitable only if THINGS GO MY WAY. That is a huge huge difference.
From your responses, I see that you haven't even grabbed a pen and piece of paper and did the most simplest of calculations. You just have a feeling that this will be profitable in the end. I... just don't know man. That's just stupid.
The probability of price of an asset rising means absolutely nothing. There are lots of stuff that is guaranteed to appreciate in value. The problem is about time: how long will it take to reach x? The thing with the markets is that you are not the only player and the time cost of appreciation is often priced in. It is always 99% priced in, the last 1% decides if you'll ultimately be profitable or not.
Can you answer this simple, very simple question: Suppose, bitcoin price stayed THE SAME as today's. It won't fall, it won't rise. In that case, exactly how long would it take for you to recoup all your investment? If you can't make this calculation (and I'm not talking about feelings) then you're just gambling just like any other.
With that answer, we can calculate how fast bitcoin should appreciate for you to be *actually* profitable, say, in 1 year, or in 5 years, or in 10 years. You are not profitable yet, and the odds of you being profitable depends on this simple calculation.

Nothing is really worth anything other than what people as a whole decide what it is worth.


This is all circular logic. I agree with you in principle but if the method of attacking it is trying to buy it whole, then it becomes circular logic. The problem here is "how are you going to attack it and possibly destroy it". My point is that your suggestions don't make sense.


It was a simplification. In reality, it isn't a single people. It could be millions of people holding a fraction of it. While US government is buying it, it will increase in price, and people seeing the rally will buy along with the government.
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:14:58


Are you playing dumb? The issue isn't that people were not able to get their funds transferred back from BTC-e. The issue is that they were a criminal organization.
Their crime was not not paying their customers their money. They were actively doing money laundering, and they seem to be directly involved in gox theft years ago.
The issue isn't about their customers getting their money from their accounts. That has nothing to do with the nature of their criminal enterprise. Completely different things.
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:55:02


What does that even mean?


At what cost? You can crush all cryptocurrencies if you sabotage the worldwide Internet. All they can realistically do is to stop banks from doing anything BTC related. I don't live in the USA, they can't stop me from exchanging fiat for BTC from my neighbour. Even if they can control BTC in the USA (they can't), the world at large will keep using it and developing it.

Sorry but you have absolutely no idea how markets work. Buying and selling is a self balancing system. In a market, you have buyers and sellers. If buyers (or the amount that needs to be bought) overpowers sellers, price shoots up. As price shoots up, sellers demand more and more money to sell because there is buying pressure (that dynamic is what moves the price). Suppose BTC price is $1, and you have the last BTC. USA comes to you and says I'LL BUY IT FROM YOU NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES, how much money will you want from them? Yes, rationally you'll want ALL the money they have. The price of a single bitcoin becomes that. That's how markets work if you have guaranteed buyers (or sellers, the inverse happens then).
Not to mention that BTC will continue to be mined.
If you know someone is trying to buy huge amounts, sellers wait. When they wait, buyer must increase the price. When *people* see price shooting up, they join in the buying amplifying the buying pressure. Price goes up and up and up.
When you buy all, it doesn't magically be worth trillions of dollars btw. Because if you want to liquidate, then the reverse occurs, there is selling pressure. The price goes down and down and down.
Banning, I can understand the attempt though I don't think it would be successful. Trying to buy (or seize and burn) would be stupid, it would have the inverse effect.
And even if they do it somehow, BTC serves a purpose. People can create something new and identical in functionality to serve the purpose if BTC becomes impossible to use. The technology allows it.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:38:40


Ironically this has never been Bitcoin's forte, yet. It's not like this exists and US can threaten it. And let's not forget that cryptocurrencies are global and can serve different functions in different economies / countries / circumstances.


This comes to my "at what cost" argument. There are reasons why US can't stop it. There are ways of stopping it, but the game is played in a way that all those ways are way costlier / impractical.

Where do they say that? I just used Google Translate and it says "We'll try to get the site back online, but if we can't do it by September 1st, we'll start refunds". Doesn't tell much about "how" but tells a bit about "when" am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:02:25
This will never be Bitcoin's forte. Investing, exchanges etc. will always be unsafe or too much of a hassle.
Why? Because centralized fiat money has emergency rescue methods when shit hits the fan. When you deposit your money to a bank, bank uses your money to invest. Gives it away as credit. It is opaque to you, you assume you will be able to get your money back. Your money is not at the bank however, someone else has it and it is uncertain that they will be able to pay it back to the bank so that it will be paid back to you. But you generally have not much of a worry.
If economy goes to shit and no one can pay their debts, banks shit bricks because they won't be able to pay you back if need be. The money is not flowing in the economy.
In that case, governments, banks can create money out of thin air to inject some movement into the economy. With correct policy management, the crisis can be averted with no ill effects.
With bitcoin, such a thing is not possible. You can't create it out of thin air. You can't safely store it in an exchange. An exchange cannot invest the deposits without risking **your** money. You are never shielded. You can't be shielded from a crisis by design.
Bitcoin is great for many things, but saving / investing using a 3rd party will never be one of them. Not because they can't be secure (although that is a huge problem) but because of the way modern economies work. No one has central control of the money supply so you can't have a central monetary policy (which is by Bitcoin's design, it's not a flaw). That means any crisis will always be destructive to investors not in direct control of their money. I can't see a mechanism where this will change.
@_date: 2018-12-08 12:33:51
It doesn't work that way either. Betting that the value will go down is not automatically a bet against volatility. Someone can claim that it will go down (or up) but might not know the path it will take. If it goes up, *then* down, having sizeable shorts can bankrupt you. Or if you are betting it will go up, it does not mean that it can't go down substantially before going up to your target - which can again bankrupt you.
So to take a position, you should have a target, yes, but you should have an idea about the path the asset will take to reach your target. If you don't / can't know the path, just because you are confident about your target does not mean that you can take a position with that target in mind. It doesn't naturally follow.

Suppose the guy thinks it will go under $1k eventually.
You first said "I'll buy your coins for $1k now PM me" and it didn't make sense.
Then you said "if you are so sure, short it!"
My explanation is for the second one. Just because you have a target does not mean you can trade on it. It can go to $10k before ultimately reaching sub $1k and you might not have enough cash or risk appetite to ride that position to $10k first. And this is relevant to the fact that you don't know such volatility *will* occur, but that it *can* occur.

You can't run a *legal* exchange that is able to work with your money without knowing who you are. In other words, the thing you are suggesting can only run by people you shouldn't trust your money with.
You can't have an anonymous and risk-free (meaning government will interfere if they try to steal your money, among other things) exchange system if you want to work with a government's issued currency. That is by design.
