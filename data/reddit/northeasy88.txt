countries that don't have 300 million people or spend 4% of their gdp on military.  also, if I had a bad hip or knee, I'd rather not wait [6 months]( for surgery...

Comcast, if you consider them a monopoly, would be an example of monopolies existing in a state-run capitalist society... it wouldn't be an example of how a monopoly could exist if they had no state to run to, to deter competition.
I wouldn't consider them a monopoly though, since I live where they have a pretty big market share (the city they're actually headquartered out of) and Verizon is actively competing with them.  In fact, Verizon is literally paying people to hold sign up booths on their lawns in neighborhoods and people are flocking to them, me included, because Comcast's customer service is so bad.

all you said was "batshit insane," "crazy," absolute nutters."  You could have taken one sentence to, you know, actually state what you disagree with instead railing off adjectives.

bombs and guns are very expensive.  their prices would rise, and competitors would appear... ones that don't have giant private military budgets.  how long do you think WalMart would be in business if they were kidnapping people and putting guns to their head and saying "Shop here, now."?  most of the money "companies" like blackwater get are from taxes.  thinking a military in a stateless society could just do as they will, ignoring their customers and shareholders, is a fantasy.
