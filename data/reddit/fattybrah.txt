Don’t know why you’re downvoted. Most shorts opened in the 7+ range and are in profit. We would need to blast up to the fucking sky to get them liquidated.

I like following the herd. It’s made me lose a ton of money but I feel better about following the herd because it comforts me in knowing I’m not alone but I’m part of the herd. Thank you for reading.

any technical analysis geniuses from the Bull Market of 2017 want to give insight on what the future holds for us? or did your crystal ball stop working?

Bitcoin needs to go lower anyways. So low that a shitload of buyers enter the market and spark the next run up
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:02:13
I was greedy while others were fearful until I was -95% down from my initial investment. Now i'm just delusional

He says we’re going up and this reversal is the real thing. If he’s right then he is a fucking GOD. If he is wrong then he’s still ok in my book. His content is valuable.

no one wants to buy when prices are low but people want to buy when prices are sky rocketing
@_date: 2018-08-04 21:32:45
if it looks like a lambo, feels like a lambo then it must be a lambo
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:34:57
If I was a whale I’d be happy that price is tanking as bullish news are releasing. Scoop up cheaper coins before the next wave up 
@_date: 2018-08-31 22:01:38
that's some next level poetry right there

Market makers aka people with deep pockets who can push price a certain direction due to lower volume

@_date: 2018-08-29 21:20:01


they probably sold at the bottom, opened up a fat short position and is banking on the market going down to recoup losses, however, as btc price slowly climbs up they will get liquidated completely.
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:13:39
We been talking about ETF approval since 2013, actually lol

I enjoy a bull market more where you can gain anywhere between 1x to 100x of your initial investment.
@_date: 2018-10-21 00:02:47
I’m guessing they are also buying OTC

if the Tulip Mania has taught me anything its that human greed doesn't care about fundamentals in an asset that is going parabolic. Greed is crazy!
@_date: 2018-11-02 18:41:11
People are attracted to buying high. Right now prices are low so they don’t want to buy lmfao

No body knows where bitcoin is going. And if someone says they do, they’re delusional.
