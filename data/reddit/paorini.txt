If you like it so much you know better than me how governments are doing everything they can to keep less and less in circulation. I remind you that electricity, paper (environmentally undriendly) and ink, in some cases plastic or other materials are needed to produce cash. Cash is awesome BTW, BTC can't replace it and can't compete with it if not on the point of the ease of paying internationally with it.

Paper BTC you mean?

I just looked up MSFT (Microsoft stock) market cap, it is 1000 Billions roughly. So BTC reaching that market cap should make it much harder to manipulate, not impossible but very risky to manipulate for virtually anyone. I am sure there are groups of people able to manipulate a stock like MSFT or AMZN, the reason they don't do that is that there are easier targets and it takes such an enormous amount of money that none is willing to risk that much :).

Sorry to tell you that you are as biased as the author of the post. 


Fiat does require electricity, the international banking network certainly consumes plenty of electricity.


International wires take up to 5 days at the moment... A SEPA transfer in Europe more often than not reaches the destination the following day. Very few people consider that visa and mastercard transactions are confirmed instantly and than cleared much later. So they are available to the merchant after several days in many cases, because of the reversable nature of fiat transactions.


Fiat payments require a fee, whenever you tap your card somewhete the merchant is paying a % of the transaction as a fee. The merchant just includes it in the price so it seems free to you, but you are actually paying it.


True! I couldn't agree more, that's why it can be useful to look into alternatives like Monero.


I often think about this as you probably do. Even assuming that over 50% of BTC is controlled by a group of people the system of BTC blockchain is still awesome. What would suck is if over 50% of computing power is controlled by a group of people.

Just relax it is a matter of time and money thrown in BTC. When market capitalization and liquidity of BTC and crypto in general will increase volatility will decrease. Let the free market do it's thing, regulation is just a way to stop new players from coming in and make the rich richer.
