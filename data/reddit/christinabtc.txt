Paging He is flying constantly to get stories. He is in Seattle right now working on a story. I'm not sure I have met anyone who hustles as hard as he does for stories.
He tweeted a picture of the BFL ex-parte order before it was unsealed and people ripped him to shreds saying it was fake... then it was unsealed and other sources reported it.
I'm biased. I write for the site as a contributor but I was attracted to it because he is trying. Really fucking hard.

Christina from Coin Fire here and I am curious as to what sort of impact the proposed BitLicense regulation will have on your business. Will you keep serving these new businesses in New York you will be onboarding from the zero processing fees promotion?

He hustles a lot.

Yeah, I think his flight leaving out of Seattle is soon though. Tweet him  or send him an iMessage mike and or email.
He is always looking to meet up with people.

A place like the NYT will take months of investigating even if he has the goods.

Lesson: Don't respect embargoes imposed by government agencies. Just publish. See them in court later.

The need for a birthdate, city etc makes this ripe for phishing in my mind. My thoughts.
If you remove the requirement I provide those info and make them optional I would be more inclined to signup.

That was very revealing as a female.

We actually had boots on the ground so if we had run them when they said we would face legal ramifications we would have had a hard time avoiding some potential issues in the future.
Lessons learned though. Verbal agreements will be treated as if they didn't happen and we won't agree to embargo anything.

Still seeing some issues on my end. I'll give it a try again in a bit :)
Hope we can all help with the beta testing.

I'm sure they are working on the other half?
