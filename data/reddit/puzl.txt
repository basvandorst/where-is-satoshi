I've always maintained that more pools like ghash.io was the solution.
In fact, wouldn't p2pool allow an entity to amass 51% without anyone knowing.  If I had 51% of all bitcoin hashing power grown slowly over 12 months in p2pool, what would stop me from suddenly switching all of that hashing power into a private pool with nefarious intentions?

Aaaah you never disappoint
@_date: 2017-02-07 13:55:23
Yes absolutely.  Those who wish to access additional services outside of those provided by the public funds would need to pay for them themselves.  
For example, people who wish to race cars above the speed limit and want to do so on their private race track should not expect public funds for such endeavours.
People who wish to indoctrinate their children into a specific creed should be allowed to do so, but not on the tax payers expense.
Your comment is suggesting that parents somehow pay for their education through taxation, but this isn't the case.

I 100% support the rights of parents to educate their children in whichever type of school they choose - but not at the cost of public education funds.

I what if a  storyboard of season 8 is there?  With specifics of how the endgame plays out and how it will setup the spinoff shows.
That's a huge treasure trove to HBO.  From a purely financial perspective 250k is cheap to keep that from leaking.  The problem would be that once they demonstrate a willingness to deal with hackers they would surely legitimise the strategy for other would-be hackers.
@_date: 2016-12-05 09:58:41
These communities will find a way.   Facilitators will spring up and charge a hefty commission for making the money flow.   From one person to another it'll be a cash to cash transaction.  The black market facilitators might use Bitcoin.. or some other mechanism for bypassing regulations.   It's not entirely different to how banks work, after all.

bitstamp is also good, supports easy money transfer from bank account and allows purchase via credit card.

Just some advice:
Iterative SHA has some weakness for password generation in general.  I'm assuming these weakness are not as exposed in PKI as the problem is different in nature, but still, would you not look at some kind of key stretching instead like PBKDF2 or even something based on scrypt?
BTW the correct way to test this is to post a list of, say, 10,000 words that you limit your password choice from.   If your intention is to make it difficult for someone to brute force from a pool of words that contain the password, then you need to guarantee that people are brute forcing with an algorithm that will eventually work, given enough theoretical time... otherwise, you're just hoping people don't guess your word, aren't you?

Okay.. food for thought right there.. I too used to root my phone but stopped out of security concerns.
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:30:17
I just wrote a quick python scrypt to get some idea.
First, I generated a dictionary of 1-5 character common british and american english words, removing duplicates.
This gave me about 7618 words.
Then I pregenerated all the private keys for some specified numbers of SHA iterations ( 1..255 ).
Then I wrote a scrypt to calculate the public key for each key in each iteration using pycoin.
This takes ~200s per SHA iteration set.
so, assuming a number between 999 and 99999.. it is going to take a while...
I think you'd have to do this on a GPU to have a reasonable chance of beating it.

Perhaps a new way to pump and dump is the hype pump.  Move a large amount of old coins to create unease amongst whalewatchers and add some random satoshi lore to the transaction comment and see what happens.  Surely the expectation is the price will drop as people wait to see what such a large amount of coins do.
@_date: 2013-11-08 08:37:52
They are held by bitstamp.  Read up on the basics and always use two factor authentication when available.  When I started I moved half my funds from bitstamp to an electrum wallet.  Start by moving £1 to get the swing of things.  Do not take shortcuts with your security.

Personally, I've no interest in gambling.   I just like to see Satoshi-Dice promote themselves in such an effective way, and consequently, promote BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-19 11:02:56
But you don't have to pick a difficult to remember number..  You can just pick a simple deterministic algorithm for generating the number from the password.

Did you get a reply from support.  Moved my coins (not a large amount) about an hour after I spotted the news here on reddit, and received them the next day.
 My ~€200 is still there though.

I tried googling you to find out who you work for.
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:36:12
Not really. There was definitely a large amount of coins moved. Definitely mention of satoshi in the tx. High likelihood of caution by whale watchers.  All I'm imagining is intent.
And even at that, I'm just proposing it as a possibility to consider.
