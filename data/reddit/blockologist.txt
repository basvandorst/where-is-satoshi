Increase the block size please! Have you seen the tx's the past two days? Everything is back logged.

Won't this create a "fee market" as some have put it? With dynamic fees as you suggest won't the fees just increase then and everyone will be fighting for higher fees/faster transactions? I'm not clear on how this is stopped. Does Bitcoin then become an elitist currency, which won't be used by the common person? 
Why would I pay high fees for a Bitcoin transaction when I can pay similar fees for credit card processing?

What??? So another year and a half of this???? Why doesn't Bitcoin Core just raise the size now and do Segwit later?? I don't get it.

But a handful of Chinese miners and Core devs does? 
@_date: 2016-03-01 01:17:57
What on earth?? I'm not a coder so I can't do that. Are you saying I should sell my Bitcoin and leave since I want Bitcoin to scale?

You can hodl forever but that won't solve any problems when at the end of the day you just end up a bag holder with Chucke Cheese tokens.

Welcome to Reddit. And to answer, No I did not forget to put /s.

That's right, you show who's the real boss around here!
@_date: 2016-03-03 00:42:13
I'm not leAving. I've done nothing wrong! 
@_date: 2016-03-04 20:46:51
Cool, nice video too
@_date: 2016-03-01 01:58:03
No I won't leave! You leave!

huh why don't you become a mod here instead, this sub needs it way more. have u tried to be a mod here, it probably would be more useful and needed to audit things here instead. 
@_date: 2016-02-04 23:08:51
Good catch! Source code aside though, I highly doubt bci is sending your information/tx's to law enforcement lols more like working with them to educate them on how bitcoin/blockchain works. Anyways, this can't be good for Samurai.

yeah I get that it's open source but i've been reading lately that blockstream pays 10 core devs. is that right? 
@_date: 2016-02-05 13:09:39


I don't get this comment. Blockstream has $75m in funding and they are sponsoring/paying 10 or so core developers. I wouldn't call that volunteering. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:25:50
Great.....when will Core increase the block size? This seems to be hurting us badly. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 15:13:00
Cool! I'm trying to use it but it's running a bit slow. When do you think the newer version will be deployed? I can add it to my list. I try keep tabs on block explorers, and see the differences and see what's new (and missing) when extrapolating data from the blockchain. I thought I'd share my list with everyone in case they didn't know there were quite a few explorers out there. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 16:02:34
feel free to post back here when it's done so I can add it! :)
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:14:50
Yep, got it already (line 12). Thanks!
