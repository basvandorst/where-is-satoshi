Except on an exchange theres no way to specifically identify an order placed by someone else, unless it is outlandishly outside of the values in the current orderbook.
This is why fine tuning is important. If I've set specific conditions for the bot to trade with, a rogue transaction would stand out like a sore dick.
Moreover, if it was trading on my behalf if'd never have access to more funds than I give it. If I'm sensible, iI'd never give a bot (or indeed any trading scenario) more than I could afford to lose.

...and my point is its hard to drag yourself out of being poor without getting hammered for tax. Its not a great environment for future financial planning.
Lets say you have $37k saved up to invest and wisely you decide, one day I might be too old, fucked and ill to be able to work and care for myself. Therefore I should prepare.
$37k isnt a lot of money...especially if you sit on it for decades.
The government should reward you for that decision. Since your money isnt only working for you, its being used to fund businesses, pensions and so on. You're taking financial pressure off the powers that be.
Instead everytime you take a proactive step to make your money work, to make sure its invested in the right place the IRS penalises you.
If you invest capital into a property of some description and that investment starts to lose steam forcing you to move your invested capital into a different property you get penalised.
The IRS is a ball and chain.

Ones ability to reduce tax is proportional to the amount of crypto available to liquidate.
If someone had $1million, purchasing a flight to Monaco (or $tax_haven) and opening a bank account to deposit to is trivial. You just need an airline ticket, proof of ID and €250,000 (minimum initial deposit amount).
If someone had say $50,000 (over the threshold of most countriesnfor CGT), not so much. A bank in Monaco (or indeed $tax_haven) won't give you the time of day. You're stuck.
It's not difficult to make yourself tax efficient, it just requires large amounts of capital as you are  probably aware.

*Rubs temples*
Alright, in a broadstrokes nutshell.
Bitcoin is a distributed ledger that contains a record of which keys control what proportion of the existing "coins".
There are no coins to speak of.
Think of it as a kind of giant cake with a distributed list of who has a portion and who has control of which portion. All without physically possessing a slice of the cake.
Everyone round the table knows who has what. They can verify who has what by asking around the table.
When you broadcast a transaction on the Bitcoin network. You're letting everyone know that you've assigned a specific amount of value to another set of keys.
Or in the case of the cake, if you want to give someone some cake, instead of physically slicing a slither off your slice and handing it to someone, you simply update everyone round the table telling them that you've given a piece of cake to someone else at the table.
Unlike a cake though, Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. You can have ever thinner slices.
Whereas with a cake, you can only slice it to the point where its physically impossible to slice it any thinner. You'd need to bake a new cake. Inflating the amount of cake.
I hope that makes sense.

Firstly I'd put on some Ultravox then sip my whisky in a room with nothing it but loads of candles, a table and a decanter of scotch.
I'd lean against a pillar on the wall and put my face on my arm looking like I'm in a state of anguish.
Id hang there for a few minutes.
Then I'd randomly have a burst of rage and throw my whisky glass at the opposing wall, collapsing to my knees. Putting my face in my hands. Id ponder how it came to this.
Then I'd thrust open the doors to my balcony and let the wind billow through the flowing white curtains.
Id then step out into the rain, drop to my knees again and look at the floor and just stay there for a bit. Contemplating the point of hodling for so long for so little.
Then I'd walk back in, pick up the decanter and drink from it. Then I'd sling that at the wall.
Then and only then, when I've come to terms with cashing in Bitcoin, would I transfer some to an Exchange, trade it and withdraw to a fiat account.

I think it will rebound soon. The price feels artificially suppressed to me.
I've had "8th - 12th" on a post-it note stuck to my screen since December. I based that prediction on previous years. We seem to rebound a couple of days earlier each year, though we seem to be on track for the 16th. (Which is where we rebounded a couple of years ago).
So sometime soon we should see some upward movement again. Will it be a moonshot? Who knows?
We are at the end of a cycle that repeats itself though. Various indicators are suggesting a rebound. 
What I have noticed is a lot of analysts were waiting for around $11k-$12k before entering a position. We could still slip that low. We'll see.
I'm not a self aggrandising "technical analyst" though, I just follow what I read. Historically I've usually been right.
I'm also a long term trade kind of guy. My last position was in Litecoin...for approx 6 months. I'm not a short term / day trader.
Right now Bitcoin looks pretty juicy to me. $7k short of the ATH, stable(ish) price, indicators in the right place. We just need the whales charts to line up and them to swoop in...

Neither was your ambiguous request.
Are you looking to talk about the business use case, economical impact, social impact, applications in automation, energy use, implication of using surplus business equipment for mining out of business hours ... ?
How about you start an interesting dialog and then we can weigh in.
To understand how to begin a dialog. Walk into any department in your university and tell them you'd like to talk about X. I.e. go to the Physics department and ask them for a conversation about Physics.
The first thing they will want to know is which aspect of Physics.
You: Hey is is this the Physics department?
Prof: Sh'yeah. Sup?
You: I'd like to talk about Physics.
*awkward pause*
Prof: Aight, what about it?
You: You know, Physics, I need to write a persoal statement about it.
Prof: Yeah but...what the whole field of Physics?
Bitcoin and the discussions within it are vast and varied. You don't just talk about Bitcoin.
I think what you meant to say to us was:
I need to write a personal statement about Bitcoin for my Business course, I'm not very imaginative or creative (which makes me prime MBA fodder) so I'd like some ideas. What topics should I cover?
You'd have got a warmer response with that.
Now come on. Help us along here. What do you want to cover. How can we blow the hat off your prof?
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:05:11
What are you on about?
If you invest and buy 1 bitcoin and that bitcoin goes up by 10% then you draw down the original investment leaving the remainder invested, you haven't actually turned a profit (or to use proper terminology, made a capital gain) until you draw down the remainder since the remainder hasn't been realised yet. Since the remainder is still invested the taxes are deferred. You have to make a capital gain before  capital gains tax applies. If youbdraw down your original capital you haven't made actually made a capital gain.
In the case here. Fiat is your capital, Bitcoin is your property. Until you realise a capital *gain* from the property you have no tax to pay. The bitcoin still held is property not capital.
Thats how CGT works pretty much everywhere.

It takes time for things to be available to the poor.
Based on this quote. All the cancer treatments in the pipeline should be dumped until we can find one cheap enough for the poor to benefit from. It's not worth it if its expensive.
Also, fuck SpaceX.
If we can't send all the poor people in India to Mars on the first flight, why bother?
Lastly, Bitcoin does help the poor ultimately. Crypto has its "own brand" value range...they're called shitcoins.
Bitcoin is definitely a revolutionary technology, but its not upto Bitcoin to feed poor people. Thats for society to sort out. If society doesn't care theres nothing Bitcoin can do. Bitcoin is simply a conduit.

Well theres no limit (outside of current technical limitations) that I am aware of.
Currently, it is divisble by 8 decimal places.
In the world of 64 bit computing we can reach somewhere around 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 decimal places should we choose to.
Granted thats not infinite, but its a technological limit imposed by current memory addressing bound by a 64bit space. It is not a limit imposed by Bitcoin or maths.
Bitcoin has no explicit finite limit to the number of decimal places it can support outside of 64bit boundaries...at least not that I've ever seen. Something that is not finite is infinite.
Therefore divisibility is infinite.
It's important to understand that infinite does not mean never ending, it simply means there is no explicit final point that can accurately be determined.
Think about it purely from a mathematical perspective.
At what point do we cross over from 0.1 to 0.2?
Move along from 0.1 incrementally until you hit 0.2.
I'll kick start your list.
Lets skip a bunch to save time.
Ok we got this far, we can finally rollover to 0.2 right?
We can keep going 
and so on.
We can keep doing this forever and never reach 0.2 there is no mathematically explicit limit to the number of decimal places that can exist.
You can only reach a point where a decimal place is so small that it is mathematically insignificant.
The same applies between any two numerical points.
Between 0.1 and 0.2 the number of decimals is infinite.
Between 1 and 10 its infinite. Between 0 and infinity its infinite.
Mathematically, we can continue to divide forever. Theres no physical limit to the maths. Maths doesn't care.
Assuming underlying technology keeps improving and ticking along, we can increase divisibility as it moves along and as adoption increases over the decades.
Vires in Numeris.

Id imagine most people here have less than 0.5 if thats what you're asking. But 0.5 is probably average.
Given the distribution of coins across wallets listed at blockchain.info I'd wager tha the vast majority of people holding Bitcoin probably hold less than 0.25
Once you get to 1BTC levels the number of potential hodlers drops dramatically.
The curve gets steeper still when you reach over 10.
Lets do some simple fag packet maths. There are 12 million addresses with between 0.1 and 1 Bitcoin.
Lets assume the average wallet has 24 inputs (no basis for it, but lets be generous).
That means approx 1 million wallets hold somewhere between 0.1 and 1 BTC. The median being around 0.5.
Id say 1 bitcoin is uncommon. 10 Bitcoin is rare. Above 100 is extremely rare.
This also means that the average hodler is below most capital gains thresholds until Bitcoin breaks $12k again.
This is probably why we get an influx of tax questions when Bitcoin hits a certain price point.
Of course this is speculation. I could be horribly and massively off the mark.

Yes we have and rebounded just as many times. Bitcoin isn't done...yet.
I think we have another couple of spikes yet.
I too have been in since early 2013 I've seen what you've seen. However, I also think that a lot of people from that time that have cashed in probably did so because they've never seen the wealth they've accrued before and are probably afraid they may never seen levels like it again and like you are quitting while they're ahead. Which is fine.
Also remember, for every sale theres probably multiple buyers right now. Nobody is buying Bitcoin in massive blocks. The small trades are far outweighing the dumps...this chips away at the whales...hell I'm aware of loads of people that have recently bought in during this dip that have previously dismissed Bitcoin and it ain't just fomo. The more people are talking about Bitcoin the more people are understanding its benefits. Wider adoption isn't far off.
After a couple more spikes we'll probably hit a long term period of ranging prices...mainly due to saturation and adoption but also because it will become a lot harder to manipulate the market and because more regulation will be phased in.
To be fair, I think this consolidation is a good thing. If we'd have gone higher the dip would have been much, much deeper.
We've seen bigger drops and longer bear markets. We've endured more FUD and until recently most of us have endured being sneered at.
Thats just my 2c though...I am not an expert and I could be completely wrong...I'm pretty certain I'm not though.

You export keys using the Core Wallet software (the software thats telling the blockchain isnt going back far enough).
You dont need the full chain to export the keys. You just need to get the keys out with the dumpwallet command in the debug console.
It might be worth checking blockchain.info to see if theres actually any coins in the wallet.

Yeah I smell something fisby with Tether however, who says they have to have a physical dollar in order to realise the value of a dollar?
As we all know the vast majority of actual USD that apparently exists only exists on your banks books.
It is probably possible to create tether on the back of a sale of Bitcoin on an exchange.
For example, user A has 1 BTC he wants to sell, user B (exchange masquerading as a legit seller) wants to buy BTC.
User A puts order on USDT/BTC orderbook. User B has USDT (backed by nothing, theres no actual Tether to back to fill) and fulfils the order.
User A now has x USDT balance on the exchange. Value has been created since something with value (BTC) was swapped for something that doesn't.
As far as I am aware Tether only claims to back the USDT coins 1:1 with the dollar. I havent read anything that explicitely states that they're stockpiling actual dollars.
Still incredibly dodgy, but probably not as dodgy as some people think.
It is just another shitcoin and will probably fail hard at some stage, but I'm not convinced its 100% scam. Dodgy for sure, ill conceived probably, a scam though? Hmm not sure.
Will it drag down Bitcoin? Nah. Probably only Finex users. Expect serious liquidity issues at some point.
P.s. I hold zero Tether and never will. My gut instinct is telling me thats probably the dumbest thing to do.

How can a bot siphon cash? If you're using it for trading simply lock down the API keys so they can't withdraw.
Common sense prevails.
I'd trust a bot as far as my ability to lock it down and properly configure it.
If a bot claimed to be a point and shoot type affair, then no, I wouldn't trust it.
However, I'm an engineer so as long as I can see the source code, view the network traffic, control its environment, stop it at will and finely tune it then why not?

Don't worry. It'll come.
I can't see mankind sending colonies out to Mars with bags of coins, notes and debit cards.
When you see fiat the way I see it, its absurdly archaic.
I want my self driving car moving around refuelling itself, getting repairs, paying road tax, tolls and picking up passengers while I'm busy figuring out the best spot in the asteroid belt is for the highest demand minerals without it having to hold cash or have a  card reader.
It's going to have to calculate journey distances and thus prices and be able to accept payment before anyone climbs in.
I haven't got time for mundane shit like taking my car for a service, paying my road tax, organising repairs etc etc. Too busy trying to enjoy life.
I also don't want to own an asset that can't pay for itself.
We can't have fully autonomous systems without crptocurrency.
How else can distributor transact with a space based manufacturing plant? Or a manufacturing plant transact with myb autonomous mining fleet? How does the firm leasing the mining ships to me keep a track of the usage of their ships?
The autonomous mining ships need to arrive at the factory, quote a price for the mined materials and take payment before it docks and unloads. If the price isn't acceptable it needs to refuse delivery and head to the next factory and try again.
The ship also needs to be able to transact with refuelling stations and maintenance platforms. Surplus value needs to be sent to both the leasing firm and my Earthbound wallet to allow my TV and smart fridge to pay for Netflix and chips, so when my automated car gets me home I can sit on my smart chair can be ready to give me a full health diagnostic while I watch Game of Thrones and eat my chips and dip. The chair can then update my fridge to adjust my next shop to reduce the carbs and increase the protein in my next fridge. More importantly if the chips and dip are shit, the bowl can let the fridge know not to order them again.
My dogs collar also needs to be able to hold value so that when it detects that my dog has been drinking piss out of the loo again, it can communicate with the car to give the dog a lift to the vets and pay for itself to have its stomach pumped.
We need a world where more than just fleshy meatbags can carry value for anything like this to happen.
In the future value will be everywhere but in a meatbags pocket.
Of course, I could be crazy and we'll still have cash and the planet will go to shit because we'll be unable to clean up the atmosphere due to manufacturing still taking place on Earth and we'll run out of natural resources because we can't mine anything in space.
I know how I'd like the future to be.
To all the FUD and doombringers, history will remember you the same way as people that used to believe in black magic and burning witches.

Relax man. Everyone here has dabbled in alts at some point.
The key is to diversify a small chunk into respectable alts (Eth, Ltc, Xmr) and the rest in Bitcoin.
An 80/20 split seems to be the sweet spot. 80% BTC and 20% alts.
Given that the alts pump after Bitcoin pumps, you tend to gain on the alts when BTC drops and vica versa.
Avoid ICOs and tokens at all cost. You are highly likely to lose with those.
That way your portfolio value never really takes a big hit. It still dips but less so.
Softens the blow somewhat.

Those who panic about it need to do some googling.
Quantum computers are faster, but operate in a way that makes bruteforcing Bitcoin hashes extremely inefficient.
It would be harder to use a quantum computer (and more expensive) than a Government backed datacentre full of conventional CPUs / GPUs.
Luckily for us theres no benefit for an organisation like a Government to crack Bitcoin.
That said, if it has been cracked we'd never know about it.
If a State actor announced their ability to crack Bitcoin (or indeed any cryptographic algorithm) they'd be flushing money down the toilet since enemies of that state would switch to a different, stronger, algorithm rendering that billion dollar cracking setup useless.
When it comes to cracking encryption there are things to consider. Firstly, if its possible is it worth the risk of your enemies finding out? Do stronger algos exist that can't be cracked if they did find out? Will they switch to those algos if they find out that the weaker one is cracked?
The problem isnt technical, its political and strategical.

Satoshi suggested implementing a phased blocksize increase. Gradual increases over time.
However, since then we've come to learn that blocksize increases following demand leaves the network open to certain attacks.
Imagine this phased in approach still existed, people like Roger Ver could co-ordinate an attack on the network that forces the blocksize up ... above say BCASH.
He'd then argue that BCASH is less decentralised than $SHITCOIN.
Increase blocksize dynamically: Have people argue that decentralisation is under attack. Waste development time. Etc.
Leave blocksize: Have people argue that fees are too high, blocks should be increased. Etc.
You see no matter what happens with blocksizes you'd get some windbag claim that "bitcoin is broken".
Hence why it has been determined that offchain solutions be implemented.
As much as I think Satoshis "original vision" should be sacrasanct, some liberties need to be taken.
Satoshi is human after all and to err is human.
Satoshis vision is idealogical for the most part, since Bitcoin has been put there lessons have been learnt, we need to learn from these lessons and adapt it's as simple as that.
Bitcoin now has 9 years of wisdom to feed from, those involved in the dev can reflect on those 9 years of experience to deliver better and more robust solutions.
The alts that claim to solve the problems with Bitcoin generally only target one specific problem as well as creating problems of their own. Ultimately all cryptocoins will hit obstacles at some point. What matters is how much experience you have to draw from in the long term.
Bitcoin will always be the first and will always have more experience to draw from. Epic amounts of building and testing.
Some alts are written from the ground up and work in completely different ways and embarking on a different path (these are the interesting alts) some are just forks that take the prior code and bolt on short term fixes (these are shitcoins) usually by people that don't share the same previous experience as the original devs. They only see a problem and a quick solution a la BCASH.
Bottom line: It doesn't matter what Satoshis vision was. His original vision was a guide to follow its not the ultimate goal of Bitcoin. There are people involved in Bitcoin now that have tangible experience now that Satoshi didnt possess (unless he is still involved somewhere).
Banging the idealistic drum helps nobody as long as the core principles are kept. Decentralisation, censorship resistance, peer to peer, cryptographically assured, trustless, low cost.
All of those still apply. Even though the fees are high, they are still cheaper than the alternatives when you consider international transfers etc.
It doesnt matter if the fee is $300 or $3. Consider that a lot of ATMs charge upwards of $3 for a withdrawal in countries all over the world. Also consider that most countries have banking fees considerably higher than that.
Right now only transactions cost money with Bitcoin. Anyone can easily move their money from one side of the planet to another for free if they just carry an encrypted copy of their keys.
If increasing blocksize was the way to go, Bitcoin would already have bigger blocks. However, based on what the devs know and what they have seen it has been determined that blocksize isn't the way to go right now.

Sit him down. Give him a brandy. Ask him how he's doing. Make small talk.
Then, when your midget butlers bring in the 19 year old Swedish blonde covered in sushi, politely offer him some.
When he picks up his first maki, slam both your hands on your rosewood desk, flip it and tell him to stop being a wanker.
Point at your genuine framed McAfee cock morsal and ask him "YOU THINK THAT WAS FREE?" then pause. Then say "I PAID FOR THAT WITH BITCOIN" pause again, facepalm a little then walk out. Slam the door and mutter "JESUS CHRIST".

A web frontend wouldnt be tricky to build either.
Also, if you closely at the LCD. It has a joystick and buttons. An interface could be implemented.
I dedicate time to fleshing this thing out, but I have a family to feed. Guy gotta work for a living.
The main issue is trust. I can rig these things to generate new wallets on first startup as well as lock them down, but that wouldn't be enough to prevent trolls thinking that they're backdoored or the private keys are somehow being sent out.
A third party audit would be required to ratify that.
Even then, you'd get the "its just a raspberry pi" crowd creeping out the woodwork.

I'd do it for Bitcoin!
Minus the screen (which is fundamentally superfluous) the hardware cost is around £90 (I used bits I had lying around, so not sure of the precise cost).
I have to say though, it needs testing and tweaking. Its not 100% reliable. Bitcoind does occasionally crash. Once a week roughly.
I can probably resolve that though...just need to set aside time.

Are you sure you aren't just a pushover?
Twice is enough to be a coincidence, more and there's a pattern from which you have to derive the common constants. The common constants are generally the root of the pattern.
If I bake 20 different cakes with 20 different recipes, but ice all of them with dogshit, if people don't like the end product, I can't make the assumption that there's something wrong with the recipes. I have to conclude that it's the dogshit ruining the cakes.
It's probably best to have a long hard think about the dogshit rather than the cake recipes.

But the difficulty will increase in that time. Over which you will have mined nothing.
Its better to mine something, take the cost on the chin and sell it when its up in a couple of months time.
If you're on the breadline and trying to mine, you'll never make a profit because your circumstance won't allow it because each time you switch the miner off, you're pushing your break even point further away and letting the difficulty pile up.

Won't work. Its already been debunked.
Bitcoin was built with this in mind.
Also, there is no incentive for a government actor to crack Bitcoin even if they could.
Imagine the impact of revealing that you have the technology to crack sha256...
If it became widely known it would undermine all the investment and time put into developing it because sha384 is already out there and is considerably harder to crack.
A nation state wouldn't want its enemies to know that it can eavesdrop on sha256 because countermeasures would immediately be implemented.
This is also the case with Bitcoin. If sha256 is threatened, Bitcoin is designed to allow a drop in replacement to be utilised pretty much immediately.

For sure. My old man is old. Old people refuse to try and understand new things because they like familiarity. Especially those old people lucky enough to see some serious economic booms.
I'm young(ish), I've never experienced the government or banking system doing anything to help my generation along. Skyrocketing house prices, no tax breaks, crap pay...etc etc.
Yeah previous generations had higher interest rates, but they didnt have to pay 80% of their income on the mortgage alone and they could borrow consiserably more money relative to their income. So it was more expensive to borrow but you didnt need to borrow as much.
Then I heard about Bitcoin back in '11, since I had nothing to lose and couldn't envisage anything changing in the legacy system anytime soon I thought "fuck it" and I went full metal retard for Bitcoin. Have been following it and trying to build businesses around it ever since. Some successful others diabolically bad.
Its been an amazing ride and long may it continue.
I have absolutely no reason to trust or care about the old system. It's abstract, dysfunctional and full of people making decisions on your behalf to allow them to make decisions on someone elses behalf.
Its a system deliberately designed to be opaque.

Well when you consider that the Bitcoin network has capacity for 500k+ transactions per 24 hours and you factor in the fact that recent growth has nothing to do with general adoption its predominantly trading and exchange sites (most of which store a large proportion of the Bitcoin purchased because a lot of people will either not know to move their BTC to somewhere safer or won't be able to move it due to fees), it seems pretty unlikely that the entire userbase of Bitcoin is generating the volume of transactions we're seeing. Ergo it has to be spam transactions.
Someone or a group of people with deep pockets flooding the network with transactions that go nowhere.
Right now, it wouldn't cost the likes of Roger Ver et al much at all to jam up the mempool.
Especially when they benefit on the other side with BCH spiking. Spend a penny, make two pennies.

They have more problems in the public sector than just expertise.
1. IR35
2. Crap funding.
Why would anyone want to work for the public sector (at least as a contractor) if you're guaranteed to earn less and be forced to pay more tax?
I feel no sympathy for the public sector at all. They've had a mass exodus of highly skilled workers because they tried to fuck them.
Their only option is to ditch IR35 and pay market rates.
They also need to make bidding on contracts a lot fairer. At the moment if you try and bid on a public sector contract, you're up against Crapita et al who have a long track record of bidding low then dragging out work to make up the shortfall...which they get away with due to backhanders and brown envelopes.
The public sector is bent as fuck and doesn't really want to be helped. Therefore, fuck them.

No it doesn't, but it makes 1 coin more divisible and keeps the mining going. Difficulty will always increase and rewards will always halve. At some point you need to add a decimal to keep the rewards halving and the mining going.
If you keep adding decimals you can keep halving rewards indefinitely.
I'm not sure why people think there will be a day when the "last coin is mined".
Mathematically, we can get infinitesimally close to the last coin but never actually reach it.
I'm guessing human nature is what causes people to think that there has to be an end point. However, in mathematics there is no such thing. You can keep dividing and multiplying forever.
Think about it. How many decimal places are there between 0 and 1? At which point do we finish with decimal places before we reach 1?
Bitcoin can keep dividing indefinitely as long as we don't hit the limits of the technology at a given time. Obviously, we'd need a BIP for that and possibly a fork, but mining will never be finished.
In our current 64-bit world, we can have 9,223,372,036,854,755,807 decimal places.
We're currently using 8.
If we add 1 more decimal at some point, 1 satoshi becomes 10 (deci-satoshis??) whatever we call the next smallest denomination.

I don't want to make a sweeping statement but...
Ill bet the dude that drives it is about 55 years old, bald, divorced, wears a leather jacket, flat cap and driving gloves and has a younger Asian girlfriend. 
He regularly visits Thailand or the Phillipines.
He has golf clubs in his boot, but isn't a member of a club (he just mooches off guest passes).
He'd order a small Merlot in a pub for himself, then drink large gins if its someone elses round.
He drinks wine out of boxes at home and usually has the horse racing on.
He arrives at the pub about 3pm, but leaves at about 5pm to avoid large rounds.
He lives in a nice area, but in a flat over a bookies.
He rents a garage nearby to store his Jag, and covers it over at night.
Despite having an expensive car, he still uses a cheap Polish car wash outside of town. He never gets the inside cleaned, only the outside.
He smokes Hamlet cigars at the pub, but Mayfair Superking fags at home.
Nobody really knows what his job is, but it's probably sales related, possibly a market trader he may run a caravan park or a Post Office.
He knows everyone and can tell you what time they usually arrive at the pub.
He usually orders lamb chops, chips and peas at an Indian restaurant.
He knows a guy that can sell you trout if you want some.
Occasionally does day trips to Adinkerke because "he likes Belgium, but definitely not for the cheap fags and 10l value boxes of wine from Auchan".
Then again this is the US. I'm basing my prediction on typical UK Jag owners.
When people overseas think Jaguar, they think suave, sophisticated and quintessentially British.
When Brits think Jaguar, they think everything I described. Unless it's an older circa 90's Jag. In which case they think builder, decorator, plumber, plasterer etc.
People from the UK know what I mean.

Historically, I'd agree. However, we're currently in uncharted waters, at least as far as Bitcoin is concerned. There are big players in the game now. The patterns aren't really following the "norm". None of the points this year where I would usually expect action have provided action.
Not only that, but we've gone through the stage where the smart people have jumped in and are already onboard. We're currently facing a different crowd of people that want to get onboard but are wary because that's their nature. They're all waiting for someone else to go first.
I personally think the attitude you (and many others) hold is a major contributing factor to the price being held down.
We'll get a bull run when the "scared" money gives in and finally buys in. Because those purchases will be larger purchases. These are the classic "not sure when to get in" people. People that are making a perceived trade off to get into the action...e.g. do I buy a new car, pay the bills or get into Bitcoin? There is a perceived impact (whether it exists or not). These are average white collar people. The type that stay in the same job for decades, work 9 to 5. They grind, and because of this grind their perception of money is that it is hard earned. You'll hear them use phrases like "if I won the lottery...", "when I retire..." etc. They constantly wait for luck, miracles, time or opportunities to come to them. These people mow their own lawns because it saves twenty bucks and they don't see how that couple of hours could be put to better use. They only see the money. They generally live in fear of losing their only source of income. The government loves these people.
Waiting for the dip for these people is like trying to catch Moby Dick.
The smart money is already cost averaging and is still profiting and accumulating. Smart money doesn't care about bull runs. Smart money operates over years. These people don't perceive investing in Bitcoin as a trade off. Its just somewhere else to store their money. Like a savings account or a pension. These people don't wait for opportunities to come to them, they go to the opportunities, they make time and luck. They pay people to do time wasting tasks like mowing the lawn because they know that the 2 hours saved could be put to better use. Like attending conferences, reading, researching etc. These people don't focus on the money, they focus on the time. These people have multiple residual incomes as well as a primary income. These people don't live in fear of losing their primary source of income, because they have residual income and continue to stack residual income.
Waiting for the big dip isn't a thing to these people because they're generally profiting anyway.
I also believe that any early adopter long term hodlers that are left are genuinely in it for the long term and won't sell for many more years. These people hold a lot of coins and will not dump them all at once. They will slowly sell them off...residual income. A percentage of what they take out will be DCA'd back in. These are the people providing support.
The people waiting for the massive dip and massive bull runs are the ones we don't want because they bring fear and panic to the market and make it irrational.
Bottom line.
If your considering getting in, get in, cost average. You will make a profit over time. You will end up with a residual income.
If you're waiting for the "fabled big one", be prepared to miss it....over and over again. You will probably never make any profit. If you are lucky enough to make a profit, it'll be a one off because you'll end up waiting for Moby Dick again and his appearances are going to get fewer and further between as time progresses. You are the reason the market panics and flaps from time to time.
Wealth is something you accumulate, it's not something you suddenly come into. There are no quick wins.
Just buy Bitcoin, hodl, bleed out cash slowly, DCA a percentage of your profits back in. Wash, rinse, repeat.
If you can't wrap your head around that, stay away. Investing isn't for you.

I know plumbers, plasterers, florists, stylists, butchers and pubs that accept Bitcoin. I only know that because I asked.
I also accept Bitcoin. I'm a freelance IT guy.

It's also worth letting her know that if family helped each other out like they did in her day young people wouldn't need to take large amounts of risk and Bitcoin might not exist.
Don't sound too entitled, because you're not entitled to anything, but it's key that you highlight that the financial system is like a flushing toilet. After the first flush, once the shit has drained away, the cistern needs to fill up again to help drain the build up of shit when it piles up again. Right now the cistern is full, but the handle is broken so us young uns can't flush and the shit is piling up faster than Jurassic Park.
What that means is all the shit is piling up so fast that when the handle is fixed and the toilet does flush, it wont be enough to move the shit away. Ultimately making the flush worthless.
Next, flip the table again and kick the turkey at the TV. Then pick up the turkey and trimmings drag her to the bathroom and yell "this, is debt, interest and rising property prices and fractional reserve banking" then shove that turkey and trimmings in the pan and if possible the stupid fucking woolly toilet roll cover that is inevitably there. Jam it down with your foot. Hard and aggressively, like its your job. Slam the seat shut.
Then flush and watch the toilet over flow.
Open the lid. Point at the mess.
Then yell "and that is what happens when money doesnt hit the economy at the right time, the shit won't flush, the problem is now worse".
Make it clear that she doesnt have to give money to you, but she does have to gradually spend it to keep the economy ticking over. We can't earn unless they spend.
Slam the seat down, preferable causing it to come off its fitting then calmy light a cigarette (your hands might be shaking at this point, but thats fine, thats why you have the cigarette), put your shades on and walk out muttering "that's why I hold Bitcoin" then shout "FUUUCK!".
She'll soon understand that the only way to fix a broken system is to replace it with a better one. One that doesn't require a flush because a flush is no longer necessary.
Once you're done. Apologise to your granny. She's probably a harmless lovely old lady and doesn't deserve any of this shit from you. It's not her fault energy prices are insane and food prices are high.

If we do hit 5k theres going to be one hell of a bounce.
I suspect theres cognitive dissonance occurring within the so called "institutions". They want in but don't want to be seen getting in.
They want in because Bitcoin is the future, but they don't like that they dismissed Bitcoin in its earlier days and don't want to be seen doing a u-turn.
Furthermore, in jumping in they're going to make a lot of new people rich and they have no idea who.
If you suddenly make a lot of people rich, you're introducing a lot of new people to power.
Power that can be used to change established practices.

Who said it won't happen?
I'm simply pointing out that it will (at least while they find their feet) be shit.
Bean counters don't see the benefit in just handing out their tokens far and wide.
If they successfully nail some sort of utility, its in their interests to give as many away as possible. That way the utility will have value and will in turn give value to the token. If you only circulate a tiny fraction of the tokens you stunt the potential of the token and kill off the chances of a market around your token from taking off.
For example. If a club creates 1 billion tokens, give away less than 1% and float the token at $1. The bean counters / execs will assume that means they're sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars of tokens.
In reality, anyone interested in investing in that token will see 99% unavailable to the public and possible mega dump further down the line.
Thus, no liquidity will enter that particular market making the token basically worthless. At least financially.
Also, if nobody outside of the airdrop can buy any tokens (because the majority has been redeemed against the utility rather than trading them), then its impossible for any meaningful liquidity to arrive at the table.
My message to anyone considering launching a token, either give the majority away or build in some means of earning them back (in meaningful amounts) into your utility.
When a token is leveraged to create loyalty or is used as an exclusive means to purchase something, it can be a powerful thing. When used as a channel to raise funds nobody really wins.
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:58:38

I should start assuming sell offs at each mini pump I think and adjust the curve by about 10%. That seems to be the recurring pattern.
@_date: 2018-08-31 09:33:53
I don't see how it can be overtaken by another coin.
The main attraction of Bitcoin is that nobody owns it, runs it or controls it.
There hasn't been a coin come close to this yet.
Furthermore, every coin that has launched since Bitcoin has followed a template of sorts.
1. Write a whitepaper.
2. Produce a roadmap. Give yourself 4-5 years of bullshit goals to reach, keep pushing back the main technical milestones.
3. Build a one page Bootstrap website complete with team page.
4. Create a bunch of tokens.
5. Give away less than 10%.
6. Get a market maker to fake trading for a month or two.
7. Start a telegram chat.
8. Pump and dump over and over again.
Etc, you all know this cycle by now.

Gripping tight...hodling perhaps?
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:50:40
No I don't.
As an individual, I like Monero a lot. However, when wearing my business hat, it creates a lot of headaches and concerns that just don't exist in Bitcoin.
I don't see the cryptocurrency world as a "one or the other" tit for tat sort of thing.
I understand that it's human nature to think that there has to be a "winner" born out of challenge. That's how tech has always worked. I.e. Facebook beats MySpace. Fanboyism is normal for tech as well AMD vs Intel, NVIDIA vs AMD, Mac vs Windows etc.
However, I think theres more to crypto than just the tech.
Nobody has anonymously released a cryptocurrency since Satoshi Nakamoto.
The anonymous release of Bitcoin is a fundamental cornerstone of what makes Bitcoin, Bitcoin.
The successor to Bitcoin will have to be released like Bitcoin. Or better yet, not by a person at all.
A cryptocurrency born from AI that is maintained by AI but controlled via humans through votes creating consensus is the next killer step...we're waaaaay off that though.
That, would turn my head.

You can give them a QR code. Many people are familiar with scanning QR codes.
Especially retailers while stock taking.
It's not difficult to combine a small LCD with a script that generates a payment request with a QR code output.
This how payments are supposed to work at a basic level.
What we need is a point of sale integration...
I've been trying to research this for ages, but I dont know the standards very well and I also don't have a PoS system to play with.
Trouble is us devs are competing with the massive R&amp;D budgets of banks and their ability to push out hardware for free/on the cheap.
Here in the UK when contactless payments rolled out, most retailers could just plug in a contactless reader into their existing PoS system (unless it was truly ancient).
If anyone out there wants to fund a project to attempt to build something like this or can somehow provide me with the appropriate hardware, I'd love to have a crack at solving the problem.
I'd imagine most readers, scanners, mag strip readers for PoS systems operate over some sort of standardised rs232 interface, so it'd probably just be a case of capturing the output from the PoS system over that interface and have an intermediary device that reads the info and spits out a QR code (either a Lightning Invoice or straight up wallet address).

You sir are not seeing the big picture and you are a simpleton.
Its not purely about putting trivial amounts of value in the hands of a fisherman on the coast of Somalia.
Blockchain is about transparency.
When I donate to charity, I want to be able to see where, when and how the money was spent. This ensures that my donation is used correctly and ethically.
If I choose to donate £1 to help a starving child, my hope (as naive as it may be) is that the majority of that £1 goes towards feeding that child.
Under the current system, if I put a quid in a pan rattlers tin, I have no idea where its going. It might be stolen by the pan rattler...who knows?
Under a blockchain based business, I can follow the transaction. I'll know when and where the coins went...I won't necessarily kniw how itbwas spent, but 2/3 ain't bad.
I believe in the underlying tech...hell, I basically have to, my entire life professional and otherwise revolves around tech.
But I'm under no circumstances expecting a farmer in Botswana to accept, spend and hold Bitcoin...at least not until their country joins the same ranks as fully developed nations.
Bitcoin allows us to do more with our money and hold people accountable. That is where its value lies.
On the flipside, if people are into Bitcoin for the gains, I'm fine with that too...to each their own.
Wanting only to make money isn't repulsive, everyone has the right to make the best of their lives as they see fit.
The same philosophy applies to religions. If someone wants to believe in god, thats fine. I don't care.
If the existence of a "god" was proven, to me, that would prove the existence of aliens not the divine since creating a world in 7 days would require some serious terraforming tech and a use of energy we can't understand yet...there are no magical powers in this universe there is only science and technology. Most of which we don't understand and we don't possess.
Therefore, believing in a technology is probably the wisest thing a person can do as taking advantage of new tech moves us further along as a species. To deny that, makes you very ignorant indeed.
The future always wins.
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:37:44
Fuck yeah. Elites have done this for centuries with gold. It's how they get richer over generations. It's to allow future generations to get wealthier yet dumber.
Finally, having a fourth generation dumb fuck heir is possible for anyone that can hodl hard enough...not just the elites.
Divitiae in Hodlem!
My long term plan is to ensure that a dumb 4th generation heir has enough cash for a legendarily retarded blow out. He'll regularly be found drunk sitting in his own faeces in his crashed Lambourarri (they'll have merged by then), under a statue of Elon Musk on Mars.
Hodler "ZeroFucks" Smith-McBitcoin III will be a legend and a disgrace.
Some rich people buy sports teams, massive super yachts or rare art as displays of their wealth...but I think the ultimate display of wealth is to have a worthless distant future heir who blows it all with a complete lack of style or taste.
If that isn't an epic plan for hodling, I don't know what is.
Future memes won't write themselves. It's our responsibility to lay the foundations.
This may seem pointless and wasteful to you, but when future generations perform research on Ancestry.com and filter by "weak hands", I don't want to be in the list, I'd rather be in the "dumb but courageous" list.
Cash in if you wish, but you run the risknof having highly intelligent yet cripplingly poor descendents.
HODL. ✊

@_date: 2018-08-05 19:12:08
Yeah silly lines, I'm onboard there...but is the manipulation conspiracy actually a conspiracy? I'm not so sure it is.
Institutions are resistant to change, they don't want a shift in the top 1%.
The people within institutions are institutionalised. They don't understand or relate to anything outside their bubble.
We don't really need institutional money either. Its commonly accepted that 1% of the population controls 50% of the wealth.
That means 99% of the population controls the other 50%.
Id rather onboard 99% of the world, than 1% of it. In that situation, the 1% will have a high chance of not being able to spend their 50%. Which pushes up the value the 99% holds while forcing down the value of the other 50%.
If you're not a one percenter, just buy as much Bitcoin as you can afford. The more of us the better.

There are tons of hodlers because they have confidence in Bitcoin.
Also, it's probably better for hodlers to wait until their stash has some reasonable value so it can be liquidated via an OTC service rather than via a public exchange. A lot of OTC desks have a minimum transaction size to buy and sell.
That way you can have proper contracts in place, legal recourse in the event of a cock up and a greater level of privacy when liquidating.

I somewhat agree. However, there is an entire generation of people (young people) that haven't been given pay rises for many years and are in a position where they are considerably poorer than their parents were at the same age. They're also considerably poorer than people born a mere decade before them.
I'm not surprised a lot of young folk are hodling on and hoping for the best. It's one of the very few options they have. They can't own property, they have very little to invest and they have no immediate prospect of a pay bump. In short...financially...it sucks to be a young person right now and for that generation it will probably always suck.
Specifically in the UK, the younger generation had to shoulder the banking crisis by taking large pay cuts, facing redundancy and giving uo pay rises (which is still ongoing for many) and they are expected to shoulder much of the impact of Brexit (which most of them voted against).
Before moaning about young people, it's probably worth understanding where they're coming from.
It's also worth remembering that most of the oldies moaning about youngsters had access to cheap easy credit, reasonably priced housing, self assessment mortgages etc. We don't. We have KYC, AML, unfair credit scoring systems, massive deposits to make, declining pay packets, massive price rises etc.

Why do you feel you have to learn it? It's not mandatory to understand everything for it to benefit you.
We can't expect every one of the billions of people on the planet to understand every technical aspect of Bitcoin. That's crazy.
All you need to understand is that Bitcoin is cryptographically secure (public/private key cryptography), decentralised (controlled by nobody), it is peer to peer (no third parties between you and someone else), transactions are confirmed by people called "miners", you can verify your own transactions using your own full node (bitcoin.it, bitcoin.org), there are multiple different wallet software packages (which you choose is down to personal choice, they're all free, go and hunt them down, figure out which you like) and you should never give anyone your private keys. Also, never store your coins at an exchange.
If that piques your interest and you want to know more. Explore the internet...that is what I did and I'm sure most people here did.

Spam, lack of end to end encryption, time consuming to manage, third party trust required etc.

Email has no place in 2018.
Most people treat email like an IM anyway these days.
For important long form messages, you're better off using document encryption and signing then sharing via an IM or some other means of transfer.
Emails people send are either trivial or non-trivial. There is no such thing as a "sort of important" or a "not that important" email.
I do IT consultancy for a living and have done for over 15 years and I've yet to hear an argument in favour of email that isn't "its just easier" or "I need Outlook because everyone uses it".
There is no rational technical argument in favour of email, just dumbass users set in their ways and latched onto Outlook because "muh calendars".
Whomever thought that putting your calendar and messages in the same place was a good idea is a moron. Not only can your data be stolen from your inbox, the hacker can know where you are and what you're doing. All in one handy dandy place. So if your mailbox gets popped, the hacker can conveniently check your calendar to make sure he's safe to dump your data. If he can see you're in a meeting, awesome. If you're not, he can check for a time when you will be away from your email...oh look, John Smith is on holiday for two weeks next month...I'll come back then.
Furthermore, in the 90s it was necessary to manage your own calendar.
In 2018 there are AI services that do it for you.
In the 90s, nobody cared about security or understood why encryption was necessary.
In 2018, people have seen enough data leaks and have experienced enough fall out to know that encryption is necessary.
More importantly, people have witnessed how centrally storing data leads to monumental hacks and theft.

Quantum computing isnt simply faster though.
Its not like jumping from 1ghz to 2gz or even single core to multicore.
Its more like jumping from 16bit to 64bit and those bits (or qubits in quantum computing) having additional states (other than 1 or 0). I'm not entirely sure what the states of qubits can be, but what I do know is that the more qubits you use the more superpositions you can have and therefore the more possible states there can be.
Ive been around a long time in tech, every time I've seen an architectural change the software written for the previous architecture running on newer architecture has either been slower or horribly inefficient (if it even works at all).
Switching from transistor based computing to quantum computing is considerably more complex than switching from 32-bit to 64-bit.
Therefore, simply assuming quantum will just be faster and able to simply crush existing encryption is madness.

I agree. Just brings my piss to a boil when I speak to people in banking...they all follow the company line without question in fear of losing their jobs.
What kind of career or working environment is that? Must be soul destroying working for a bank.
Bitcoin bias aside, it makes you wonder what else the employees of these organisations blindly follow just because they'll be fired if they don't.
A lot of (older) people have a lot of (misplaced) respect for people that work in banking, when you get a glimpse behind the curtain it's horrifying to see that the advice you get from these people isn't actually worth anything, they're just following orders. The advice and information you get is what they've been told to dispense, not what is actually the best advice for you. A total sham.
Moreover, threatening people for thinking outside of the norm seems really fucking low and probably explains why the banking system continues to fail over and over again.

I don't think it will be crackable in seconds. At least not in our lifetime. Especially not on the fly.
As far as I can tell, theres only (currently) two ways to attack ECDSA.
1. Rainbow tables. These are pre-generated lists of key combinations. Given the sheer number of possible combinations, it'd take beyond the heat death of the universe to compute these and require more storage than you can imagine to store them. Moreover, it'd require huge amounts of time and resources to just search through the tables.
I'm sure someone, somewhere has ready tried to generate rainbow tables and has realised the scale.
2. Finding collisions. This is a situation where more than one key pair generates the same wallet hash. Again, the resource requirement and time requirement are beyond anything you or I could fathom.
Some other feasible attacks are:
3. RNG tampering. If someone were to compromise your local RNG or you have poor entropy, your next key pair could be forced or predicted.
4. Wallet tampering. If someone infiltrated your wallet software, they could simply steal your keys.

It was a TDi I think. TD5 is waaaay newer than I had. Mine was from 1986 (but I adopted it around 2000).
2.5 litre I think.
It wasn't particularly fast (topped out at about 110mph and had pretty lame acceleration), but if I needed to park through a person's wall or drive on the beach when I went surfing it was awesome.
It was especially good at dealing with troublesome road garbage. Road cones, street signs, bollards etc no problem, go through them.
I had the suspension raised slightly and had steel plating put round the edges for protection.
It was like a tank. So much so that on the day I passed my test, I backed into a Micra (parked round a corner on double yellows) that was lower than the backend of my landy. Went over and slightly through their bonnet and into the windscreen. The bonnet curled up like tinfoil.
It was then that I understood the true might of a Landy. The sheer power. Being able to reverse into and ruin a hatchback and barely feel it.

No you misunderstand. Quantum computing doesn't resemble contemporary processing at all.
It's as different to an x86 CPU as an ASIC is.
Quantum computing isn't simply "faster" it's completely different.

This quantum computing issue keeps coming back.
I understand why the average person thinks quantum computers might be a threat to Bitcoin (more power is more right?) and security on the whole however, it isn't for quite a few reasons.
First and foremost, the hashing algorithm used by the Bitcoin network can easily be changed and Bitcoin is already setup to switch if necessary. There doesnt even need to be a fork.
Secondly, cracking sha256 on a quantum processor isn't as clear cut as people may think. A quantum CPU is nothing like a current generation CPU. It is not going to be like jumping from a 7th gen i5 to an 8th gen i5. It's going to be more like jumping from a PowerPC CPU to an Intel CPU. The x86 instruction set functions using bits that can be toggled on or off. Binary if you will. Quantum processors have bits that can be in multiple different states. Therefore translating software that requires a binary instruction stack to a platform that uses a stack that operates in a completely different manner will be massively inefficient. E.g. a "bit" being switched to "on" in quantum computing may not hold the same significance as a bit being switched "on" in a current CPU. Hell that state may not even be a thing...it might not be that simple since a "bit" in a quantum CPU has multiple states. On, Off, Both and Neither...possibly even more...anyone here know all the quantum states?
Thirdly, where a nation state cracking Bitcoin is concerned. If you were a state player, and you managed to build a system that could crack anything. Would you risk your enemies finding out by pissing around cracking Bitcoin? Indoubt it. It's simply too risky. Would you risk pushing Bitcoin to a stronger algorithm that you can no longer crack? No, you wouldn't.
Therefore mass cracking of Bitcoin by a nationstate will never happen. It would be catastrophic.
Is quantum computing a threat any level? No. No it isn't.

@_date: 2018-06-16 20:37:58
Kind of agree. But most people here still wouldn't get it.
Too young to have been through a generational change in CPUs probably.
What is hard to explain is that sha256 performs slower in a 64bit environment than it does in a 32bit environment. Therefore any operations (such as bruteforcing) would be slower in 64bit than 32bit.
Factor in the way quantum computing works and you have a recipe for hella slow...not only that, the memory requirement is larger and given how inefficiently 32 bit floats would be addressed on a quantum computer (sha256 is 32bit), you have a situation where cracking sha256 becomes measurably more difficult...probably.
Finally, a lot of people here seem to think qubit based processing is some sort of far flung futuristic tech...
Which it ain't...you could write a program to attempt to crack Bitcoin using quantum qubits right now...on Microsoft Azure...of all places!
It's not theoretical...it exists...commercially.

Skills are worth considerably less than qualifications. This is because qualifications are a stupid persons method of attempting to determine skill.
If countries like Australia really cared about only allowing skilled people to work in the country, they'd fund programs to determine that skill.
Instead they rely on academic achievements and character references...which can easily be faked.

@_date: 2019-10-30 15:25:28
Yeah I'd be hard pressed, but it's not impossible. Therefore, not prevented. Ergo (whether formal or not) a ban did not bring about prevention.
The US is a really poor example as well, since the US likes to isolate itself because it's backwards as fuck. 
In Northern France (and that general region, including the border towns of Belgium), I can happily spend British pounds...despite the primary currency being Euros.
Same applies in a lot of places in South Africa that I've been to...despite the Rand being their primary.
Most pertinent though is that for international trade to occur you need to accept other currencies (business to business). A US company cannot expect to buy goods from a foreign nation in dollars. Some places might prefer dollars (if their home currency is shit), but most won't.
There is no "effective ban" anywhere. It's just infrastructure is geared up around specific currencies at local level for simplicity sake.

To go from 10% to 9% theres something like a £50k a year jump.

With £100k of Bitcoin, if the price still rises year on year by at least 10% a year, you could take out your tax free capital gains allowance each year and never run out of Bitcoin.

Yeah but shit runs downhill, in a crisis event where the peasants start kicking off you don't kill the golden goose (Buffet-like whale investors), you burn the village (people with savings, small time pension investors etc).
Buffet isn't successful these days because he knows what to pick, he's successful because businesses can't operate without his massive investments.
Moreover, investors like Buffet tend to own the assets the business holds (or at least some sort of guarantee over them). So whether the business fails or not is irrelevant, what matters is that they put the "investment" in the right assets.
It's why investors frown on you paying yourself out of the investment they give you. If your business goes south, they can't cash you in. However, if you spent the investment on premises, equipment and holdings...you can fail all day long they don't care they have stuff they can seize and as a bonus they can fuck you around in court for the shortfall. Their money never actually goes anywhere.
Sometimes it even pays to lose since you can write off losses against gains for tax purposes.
Buffet probably was a shrewd businessman at some stage (he had to build up from somewhere), but once you have money you don't need to be smart. It's entirely optional because your investments look after themselves...especially if you invest in a solid legal team.

Sure they could Subpoena an exchange, but there is no requirement for the exchanges to keep a log of which addresses they used for your account for any amount of time.
Nobody knows for sure what records they keep, but I suspect they only keep a log of of what you bought and when rather than where you sent it.
Even if they did keep a log of addresses you withdrew to, can anyone prove that you control those addresses?
Maybe you paid for something straight out of Coinbase, maybe you bought the coins for someone else. Nobody knows except you.
It's the same as "tracing" a phone call based entirely on your phone records. Sure, your phone bill says a call was made to Dominos at 10pm Saturday night, but unless you live alone, I can't accuse you of being a fucking savage for ordering a Hawaiian. It might not have been you that made the call...the guy at Dominos that took the order can't ID you from a phone call...short of possessing a recording of the call, there's no way I can actually prove anything...I'd have to get to your place fast and pump your stomach contents and check for ham and pineapple...even then, I can't prove you ordered it, I can only prove you ate it.
@_date: 2019-06-20 14:50:51
They can be. But when they blatantly rip people off...no.
If I ran an ATM, I'd charge a flat fee and have a minimum/maximum transaction size.
Charging $2 for a withdrawal larger than $50 but smaller than $500 seems fair.
Encourages regular max transactions.
Charging a percentage actually drives your revenue down because fewer people are dumb enough to put a massive transaction with a $2000 premium on it.
I'd wager most ATMs deal with transactions around the $20-$30 mark because of their premium. Holding out for that one nutter that wants a whole Bitcoin.

So you get taxed if it is deemed to be income or an investment. What's unfair about that? It *is* generally one or the other. Same as any asset that isn't your countries sovereign currency. Gold probably works the same way.
The only way you'll get to avoid tax entirely is if you paid for your stack in cash, break it down into smaller amounts and you wait until it's possible to spend it.
It's why we're all pushing for adoption and why most of us support businesses that accept Bitcoin, whether we want their products/services or not...because we want to drive adoption.
Nobody that's been around for a while cares if the fees are *high* etc, we just care that one day there will be a way to accumulate wealth and spend it outside of the current banking / political system and take it wherever we like, safely and securely.
Also, there's a lot of talk about Lambos and p ovate islands and shit goes on in the Bitcoin community, but seriously, who really wants a Lambo? Surely it's better to pay off your mortgage gradually with your tax free allowance? Or have a nice holiday every year?

Not true. Forex requires CGT beyond a certain threshold.
You can easily cash out Bitcoin with no tax if you cash out below the CGT threshold.
If anything that plays into the hands of BTC holders because it forces you to hold more for longer and to keep cash outs below CGT.
The threshold is £12k in the UK. Anything below that and you don't even need to declare it.
Source: 
Cash out £12k then DCA 50% back in weekly. Wash rinse repeat until you reach enough that the 20% tax is meaningless.
You get a bonus £6k each year and you benefit from DCA...all on house money.
Or better yet...just hodl until 45+ then retire.

You'll struggle to find anywhere to buy Bitcoin with Paypal due to the extreme risk on the part of the seller.
A paypal transaction is reversible, Bitcoin is not. Therefore the seller would be exposing himself to fraudulent buyers.
The same goes for credit cards etc.
This is why buying through places like Coinbase requires so much personal information and a confirmation SMS or email. Its to cover their asses in the case of a reversed transaction. It gives them ammo in the case of a dispute.
E.g. if you have to enter a PIN they sent you or click a link they can prove the Bitcoin transaction went ahead and that you got your coins at that point in time.
It's shitty but necessary unfortunately due to how easily the various fiat based systems can be abused.
If anything it proves how weak and easily manipulated the fiat systems can be.

Absolutely none of the comparisons you made are deflationary in nature or anything like Bitcoin.
Might as well overlay a graph with the golden age of piracy on it (which would have a peak in the middle), global temperatures between ice ages, the financial rise and fall of the Roman empire, the price of food during World War II in Western Europe, broadband adoption rates across the world, etc etc.
You can find charts with similar curves almost anywhere...doesn't mean they have a damned thing to do with Bitcoin and the current trend.
We've seen this behaviour before in Bitcoin at every previous spike.
I'm not saying we're not in some sort of bubble and I'm not saying Bitcoin will be around forever, but the comparisons made by some people are absurd.
You can find patterns and causality in all sorts of charts when you compare them.
For example, I posit that the rise in global warming is directly linked to the fall in the number of sea going pirates. Since the Golden Age of piracy, at which point the number of pirates on the high seas dropped off sharply, the planet has been warming up. Weird!
Also, between 2007-2014, in the US, HIV infection rate dropped approx 18%, over that time eBays year on year profits also dropped by around 18%...weird...clearly it's not in eBays interests if HIV is ever eradicated. Am I right?
Bitcoin has risen and crashed many times..It just so happens when you zoom the chart out, it appears to be crashing upwards since each fall is preceded by another rise.
Enough about AIDs and Pirates.
That chart alone shows 5 large crashes, followed by 5 even larger rises.
Have we got another crash on its way? Almost certainly. Will it wipe out Bitcoin? No. Will Bitcoin spike after the next crash? Probably. Are we in a bubble? Probably. Will the price keep booming upwards as it has forever? Probably not.
You simply cannot compare Bitcoin to anything else that has come before it. It resembles nothing we've seen before.

Many reasons. In my opinion the platform isnt very secure, its difficult to moderate, places end up invite only (which I detest, communities should be open by default, like this here sub).
Also, the platform needs structure and it needs to be accessible across as many platforms as possible and with as many clients as possible.
The three things about Reddit that frustrate me are theres very few ways to access it, the upvote system stinks and DMs are poor way to chat with someone if you manage to strike a dialog up with someone interesting.
The up/down vote system causes interesting topics to vanish into the ether and leaves the community wide open to FUD attacks. 
Plus with the way things are structured the threads become difficult to follow very quickly.
That and I want to interact with regular Bitcoiners. Most of the IRL meet ups now are corporate dross full of suits and shills and they're not really on the pulse.
This place, despite many people shitting on it, is the pulse.
I freakin' love reddit, but its not a platform for discussion really. We need an off chain solution. ;)

If you look at the climb you can see we already had two corrections.
If you're going to buy, just buy. Even if it does dip again significantly it wont take long to recover.
Seriously guys. Use your heads, never make a financial decision with emotion. Coming here and asking "when is the next dip?" is buying with emotion since you're cleary seeking validation.
To be a true hodler you need to be cold. Ice cold. Watching someone kick your dog to death and shrugging it off cold. You need to make Ivan Drago look an emotional hormonal old woman by comparison.

The traffic fingerprint, ports in use, bandwidth usage etc etc.
You easily spot a node and ban it.
Its unlikely to happen though as widespread banning acknowledges Bitcoin as a credible threat.
Therefore in a weird twist of irony, banning Bitcoin would only serve to add credibility to Bitcoin.

If it was possible to derive an xpub from a bunch of public keys it'd be possible to prove this as I'd imagine the spam is perpetrated by a person sending to themselves.
Therefore if you could prove the addresses all belong to a small collection of xpubs you could summise that this is indeed spam.

We're not naive...we know there is a problem. The technical people amongst us understand that there is no quick fix. The institutional money understands that as well.
If we were seen to be jerking left and right on a whim we wouldn't be seen as a safe investment.
Stability comes from stability. This is a financial system worth billions. You can't just fuck with it anymore. Changes can't be rolled back.
If you introduce a fix that creates more problems you increase the problems that need to be fixed. This makes the problems harder to fix further down the line.
Right now I believe BTC is in a good place. We need to push segwit adoption. Once that is sorted we can push lightning adoption.
I don't believe for a minute that high fees etc will prevent institutional money hitting bitcoin. All it prevents is small time investors. Which right now arent really helping adoption as they are buying and "hodling" hoping to make a quick buck.

Not sure why anyone would go to such lengths to hide IPs. No IP information is stored on the Blockchain. Only the initial transaction, even then, if you run a public nide there's no way to prove that a transaction belongs to a specific person.
I'd be more inclined to increase your level of anonymity rather than outright trying to hide yourself.
That said, "hiding your IP" should be done as a matter of course in general use of the internet.
It should be noted that hiding your IP is actually harder than you think.
The only realistic way (with peace of mind), is to use Tor and stick to Onion sites where possible.
If you use Tor to access sites on the clear net you should consider yourself to be exposed (even if the chances of exposure are slim).
In the case of using Tor (or a VPN), you should check for DNS leaks and disable WebRTC where possible.
To check for DNS leaks you can use  or for a more in depth look at your browser privacy settings 
It's key that people understand the difference between anonymity and simply hiding your IP address.
Anonymity is a situation that occurs when you appear, for all intents and purposes, to look like everyone else. You blend in.
Hiding your IP address can make you appear less anonymous given the amount of information leaked by your browser.
E.g. timezone information, screen resolution, latency and so on.
If your IP address appears to be in Belgium, but your timezone is PST...you obviously aren't in Belgium and you stand out more than you would if you just used your own IP...not only do you stand out because of the mismatch, you also, clearly, seem to be attempting to hide. Thus, in hiding your IP you made yourself less anonymous.
Screen resolution is also important when using the Tor browser. If you leave the screen size as the default (don't maximise), you will have a screen size more like the majority of users on Tor. If you maximise, you could end up being that one guy using 1280x1024 screen resolution and become that much easier to track.
Remember kids, anonymity is blending in, it is not hiding.

It's not that difficult to implement. There really isn't that much to Lightning on an implementation level. Everything is already there, you just need to hook into the local API and plugin to your existing payment logic.
The biggest risk of LN implementation is people wanting to make larger transactions. In order for a transaction to go through you need routes with channels large enough to accommodate the required transaction.
At the moment we have loads and loads of channels that are tiny, so moving small amounts works perfectly. But if you want to move say $1,000 the number of channels that can accommodate that shrinks considerably. Even more so for larger transactions.
What lightning needs is a mechanism that breaks down transactions into tiny amounts and reassembles them at the other end.
This may be in the works, but I've never seen it in action.

Bitcoin as it is, is not what Bitcoin will become.
It's still very early days...innovation follows necessity.
In the early 90s, I used to have to get on my bike, cycle for 1 hour to get to the town centre, withdraw cash out of my savings account with my savings book, queue up at the store, collect the game I wanted, cycle home, install the game off multiple floppy disks over the course of an hour, tweak the batch files to get the right memory balance and only then could I play the game. Thats only if the local retailer stocked it, if not I'd have to wait weeks a mail order request from the states.
Now I can buy the games I want on Steam with Bitcoin and be playing within minutes. It took 25 years to reach this point.
Bitcoin has been around for about 8 years. It's only been 5 years since it started gaining mainstream attention. 6 months since it starting gaining serious value to the point where its started turning heads.
Sit back, relax and just wait.

Looking at the equation, you could plug in all kinds of values and get the same S.
Let's use a less complex equation to demonstrate.
S = (5 * 4) / 5
S = 20
S = (10 * 4) / 2
S = 20
S = (20 * 1) / 1
S = 20
The real question is, does it matter if you can have collisions on S?

Unless you know for sure that your entry and exit node aren't run by the same people, you can't know that you're safe. 
An exit node can see all your unencrypted traffic too. So if you login somewhere without HTTPS or the exit node forces an HTTPS downgrade, you're compromised.
That's why it's better to assume you're already compromised.
You should always use HTTPs over Tor as well. Never browse anything without SSL/TLS.
Tor is also vulnerable to time based analysis.
You're far safer on Tor if you leave it running all the time rather than only firing it up when you need it.
Your ISP doesn't know what you're sending over Tor, but they do know when you connected / disconnected.

Profitability depends on how you approach mining.
If you can mine for a year and suck up the costs...its profitable.
If you mine and immediately cash in it probably isn't, it takes 9 months to break even (if you include running costs as well as hardware cost).
It's always been this way though...at least since 2013.
I like to think of mining as advanced hodling. Instead of putting your $6000 into Bitcoin right now, you're *almost* dollar cost averaging over time.
Mining is not out of the reach of regular folk. Only large scale mining is, but it always has been.

Lightning doesnt require them to be interested. Its off chain. Core can keep doing its thing. From my brief playtime with Lightning-C it appeared as though lightningd worked alongside a core node not physically integrated into it. Its a protocol not a feature. What we're waiting for is devs out there to interpet the protocol and build a solution that executes it.
Just make things a little clearer for people. Core are the guys that look after the infrastructure, not unlike the guys that look after powerlines, water pipes, phone lines etc.
Just like your phone engineer, Core doesn't care about anything beyond the phone socket. Which is quite right. Lightning is something that plugs into the network it is not a part of it.
For the network engineers out there, what we are likely moving to with Bitcoin is an OSI model sort of set up.
Not unlike this setup you're familiar with. 
ARP (Bitcoin)-&gt;TCP/IP(LN)-&gt;DNS(???)
If LN or other solutions were built into Bitcoin we'd end up in a similar situation to X11 on Linux. Something that started out with a specific purpose (session management), but ended up with loads of extra crap in it (printing subsystem, etc).
If Bitcoin is kept simple at its core (no pun intended) it remains hardened and secure.

Im not sure net neutrality is something that can really be killed.
As an engineer Id lend my skills and time for free to work around it. Im not alone.
I think at this stage any ISP offering a tiered service would die off pretty quickly. The only way they could get any traction is if they offered their service for free subsidised by the big businesses.
Als, when average Joe realises that he will have to pay extra for the "porn package" and that the "porn package" will be itemised on his monthly bill you'll see a rapidly growing opposition to tiered internet services.
In fact small fry like movie streaming services will have to lobby harder than the porn industry to actually get net neutrality killed off.
The porn industry is bigger than you think and will likely fight any attempt to kill off net neutrality.
Id also imagine an anonymous peer to peer internet based currency is right up their street too.
I think as soon as you see mainstream smut sites picking up Bitcoin payments we'll see some pretty rapid adoption in Bitcoin. Forget Amazon et al we need Xhamster and Pornhub onboard.
As much as I hate the idea of porn driving crypto adoption I think it is necessary. Just like the video format wars.
When people say that crypto and the internet is purely for porn, they are only about 99% wrong.

Well I use pretty easy to find off the shelf libraries. Such as the PECL trader module for PHP.
I wrote a guide here:
I've been planning a follow up demonstrating how to use it.
Once familiar with that. Inthen set out to find a decent source of candlestick data.
This is harder than you think because most data feeds are lagged behind the actual market by a whole candle.
So how far behind the market you are is pretty much determined by the candle size you use.
I typically use 15 minute candles.
The candle data is stored in a sqlite database and is topped up every minute (more than necessary to ensure I dont miss any candles).
I then have a PHP script that fires as a cron job every 5 minutes that runs the data through the PECL module which spits out a bunch of numbers I can interpret (I use indicators like ADX, RSI, DMI etc).
If the numbers all line up to match a set of conditions this creates what trader calls a signal which gets sent to my phone over pushbullet.
At that point, I can then trigger another PHP script that moves Bitcoin (using the JSON-RPC on a full node) to my trading platform of choice and open a position.
In then wait for another signal (or periodically check the market myself) and run another script to exit the position and move my BTC back.
I could fully automate this, but I feel a lot safer with manual intervention.
I started out learning this stuff using forex data (its easier to come by) and built out a simple dashboard to get used to seeing the numbers represented visually and not in chart form...for me charts sre misleading and provide way more data than I actually need. All you really need to know is which direction the market is moving (DMI), whether you're in a trend (ADX) and what the momentum of the market is like (RSI).
My forex experiment still up and running...

I also agree. However, how do we determine the next blocksize increase? Will it be enough? Too much?
Right now adoption isnt driving Bitcoins price and the only reasons we have a backlog are a) BCH is more profitable to mine and thus has the hashing power and b) since adoption hasnt climbed at the same rate as the transaction rate we have a lot of spam on the network. I.e. the network is under attack.

I sent that formula to the boys in the lab and the results are interesting. It was touch and go though, we nearly ran out of chalk and there was a punch up towards the end.
If Bitcoin jumps up 100x then his $50 of Bitcoin will be worth $5000.
Interestingly, if it only rises 50x then its worth $2500.
No matter what we do we can't fault the logic. No matter the factornof increase the result always shows a result relative to that factor. Fascinating.
The guys wearing glasses cleaned their lenses just to make sure and the result was distinctly and considerably the same.
These are the guys that make the difference. As a scientist I have to believe in what I can measure and learn not to trust my eyes. Distinguished gentlemen with poor eyesight don't have to trust their eyes because they use glasses to see...an invention of science. You see we use science to make science.
We've hit some sort of golden formula here.
Unfortunately though we've lost a tiny and insignificant fraction of the team.
They thought the result we got using maths and spectacles is incorrect. Apparently, they wanted bigger chalk and instead of maths they want to use interpretive dance and poetry.
We're not against their methods per se, its just we prefer our expressions to be purely mathematical. We like to avoid the nebulous metaphoric and overtly arty nature of interpretive dance and poetry. It is pseudoscientific hocum.
They're claiming to be the original lab too. Don't worry though, me and the boys are still in the same place, doing the same experiments and we're sciencing hard as we have always done.

If I ran one, maybe. If I run half a dozen, not so much.
The key to a good ATM is the footprint. The bigger the footprint, the higher the ground rent.
Most corner shops will only charge you peppercorn ground rent to put one in because they hedge on the extra footfall. This means the actual running costs are low.
$1000 a month from a machine that costs $1500 to buy and about $20 a month in ground rent seems like a good deal to me.

There arent many reasons, but I'll bite...
Hugely bigger pool of engineers, more rewarding to mine, greater adoption, it isn't a knock off, isn't controlled by douchebags, less centralised, used by nations, has more nodes, has institutional interest, has been tested and used by countless retailers (some huge supermarket chains have trailled it), it's the original, respects consensus, isn't a fork, more wallets, etc etc.
Finally like all crap cheap imitations if you look on the underside of most BCH it says "made in china".
That said, BCH isn't crap though since it's based on the original, however it is, for now, largely pointless.
The problem with BCH is the people behind it rather than the coin itself.
Bitcoin will have its blocksize increased eventually and will have additional technology implemented to improve things and add further functionality and possibilities. That alone makes Bitcoin innovative whereas BCH is just derivative.
I wish BCH all the best in the future, but for now, for me...it doesn't make a lot of sense. If they do something innovative that catches my attention I'll sit up and take notice. Until then Bitcoin was, is and will for the foreseeable future be the daddy.

Ok for starters nodes need to distribute blocks across other nodes. Running a node isn't a singular activity. You're participating in a network not standing alone.
So you're only storing one copy of the blockchain but you're sharing many many copies of it with other nodes, new nodes, out of sync nodes etc.
Vaguely like seeding torrent.
Upload speed is more important than download speed. Most households have a fraction of upload relative to download.
E.g. I have 200meg down, but only 10meg up. Im on an exceptional package in a very well covered area.
Also, blocksize is only a temporary fix. It will ultimately need to be increased again and again and again. Its a short term fix.
Eventually, BCH will hit the limit on their network and the only way they can go is bigger blocks...forever...since they don't have segwit.
If they implement segwit further down the line (probably after Core is ready to increase blocks to accommodate additional scaling technologies), what they will have is a less advanced version of Bitcoin.
What we need is a solution that allows us to spread these increases much further apart or render them moot. Core is working on this. Just hang tight.

Welcome to Bitcoin!
Print a QR code for people to scan to send to, install a read-only wallet on your phone to confirm payment has been received. Import your xpub only.
Thats the simplest method without anybthird party involvement.
However, its worth having a bunch of QR codes handy for different addresses in the same wallet to minimise address reuse.
Don't store your private keys on-premise. Bung them in a fireproof safe offsite.
Make sure you verify they are sending the correct amount before they send to reduce the chances of you having to provide a refund...if your keys are offsite you won't be able to do any immediate refunds.
There are better and more sophisticated ways to do this, but I think for your purposes this will work just fine.

For those confused about the "proof" verification. I'd implement that to ensure that joiners are legit bitcoiners to help keep spam out.
The process would require a wallet with a positive Bitcoin balance.
The process would verify that you both own the wallet that has the balance and that the wallet indeed has a balance.
A user would effectively have to either sign using their current wallet public key. For those with tinfoil hats, they could move a tiny amount of satoshi to another address and use that address to sign a message.
The only requirement is a positive balance, as long as its more than zero you're in.

That's not how investments work.
I don't buy a house and expect to recoup the costs in the first year. I put my money down, tie it up in the asset and when it accrues enough additional equity I sell or leverage the asset.
E.g. when I pay my mortgage, I dont expect the mortgage to cover itself.
Same applies for mining and associated costs. It's an investment.
You put your $x in, sit on the result and realise the profit when there is some.
If you can afford to mine for a while, do it. Don't worry about profits. Just put your money in and hold the Bitcoin for a while. You don't have to immediately sell it.
The only situation I wouldn't mine is if you have to mine hand to mouth. I.e. you can't afford to invest the money.

Uh huh...
I suspect that for quite a few people fee are disproportionately high because of the number of inputs and outputs in their transactions.
For example, if I wanted to send 1BTC to someone and I have just over that 1BTC existing as a single input in my wallet, I can send it as a single output. The fee here would be approx $1.92 at the current rates. Based on getting confirmed within about 40 minutes.
However, if my wallet is fragmented (lots of smaller amounts of BTC that need to be scrounged together to make 1BTC), it would cost me more. Lets assume I have 10 pieces of a Bitcoin scattered in my wallet. That would mean 10 inputs to create 1 output. I'm moving the same amount of Bitcoin, but the fee is now $15.22. Based on getting confirmed within about 40 minutes.
Yeah the fees are a bit steep right now, but they are made a lot worse by people not knowing how the fees work in the first place.
Reference: 
My tip of the day concerning fees, is work out how you're regularly going to use bitcoin and arrange it accordingly.
Not all transactions on the network are the same.

Because legend has it, if you collect all 21 million coins you get a wish and/or become immortal.
Eventually there will be a grand tournament only hodlers can attend where they fight to the death until one remains.
The gateway to the tournament only opens up when Satoshi Nakamoto sees we've mined the final coin. Only then can we cross into the dimension in which Nakamoto sits upon his throne to oversee the events. There he sits until one remains at which point he steps in as final challenger.
If defeated in his final form, the whole 21 million goes to the victor.

I'd like to thank the team for all their hard work. If it wasn't for the boys in the lab sciencing the fuck away into the wee hours we'd never have known for sure that 1BTC = 1BTC.
Endless man hours and billions of tax payer money well spent I think.
When we first caught on to the idea we were intrigued so we set out on a journey that both enlightened and surprised us.
I'll never forget that fateful moment at 3am on a rainy Sunday when the graph printed out and it dipicted a horizontal line. We'd done it. We'd successully shown that 1 bitcoin was, is and always will be equal to 1 bitcoin.
In the beginning the team went out running all over town trying to find things that were equal to approximately equal to 1 bitcoin.
Fish, potatoes, bicycles, lattes, cars, train tickets, poker chips...you name it. We laid them all out and one by one we ruled them out.
Is 1 bitcoin equal to a sockeye salmon? No. Is it equal to a Seabass? No. A pigmy shrew? Fuck no.
Then it hit us, lets calculate a graph comparing bitcoin to itself. The maths was hard, gruelling even. Some of us broke. I won't lie they were dark times. We  fought hard. There were fish, potatoes and miscellaneous items everywhere. A mess. A shambles. Utter bloody chaos.
When the sun came up, we shook hands, calmed down and got back to it. Finally we were united.
One of us couldn't agree and so bravy he announced he was going out and that he may be sometime. We wondered how he would survive by himself since he was mute and had the strength of an infant. Itbwas snowing outside afterall. We shrugged and jumped back in.
Roll on 2 years and 3 months. None of us had seen our family, celebrated a holiday or even eaten properly.
We emerged, bearded, dishevelled and severely malnourished...but we had the answer.
He didn't survive. He came back. But the buzzer was broken. Only bones, a lab coat and a beard remain.
But still the work was complete. We went through hell and we can tell you with absolutely certaintybthat 1btc = 1btc.
Life will never be the same again.

The zeros are the issue.
Also, Bitcoin has a change system built in. So as long as you transact with a reputable person, you'll get refunded the 'extra' you send.
Im not sure how everyone else transacts, but I set up a receive address with the right amount on it as a courtesy to person(s) sending to me.
Most wallets let you do this.
Anything over the request amount goes back to the sender as unspent inputs.
Various places implement this. Like Shapeshift for example.

Lack of concensus isnt the problem, time and complexity are. We all agree that World Peace is worth a crack. Trouble is, wanting it hard is not the same as implementing it properly.
Fixes are in the pipe line. Theres a few working Lightning implementations you can develop and test with in order get yourself ready for it.
If you're interested in the spec you can read it here:
Once you're upto speed feel free to wade in and help test / develop like a lot of us here.
If you're only here for the memes thats fine, sit down, eat your fish sticks, take in some dank memes and let the grown ups get on with it.
If you're only here because you're a speculator struggling to sleep at night. Sucks to be you.
Everything you need to know about Bitcoin, where its going, whats being done and whats in the pipeline is all out there follow the code. Bitcoin is as open as it gets. Nothing happens behind closed doors thats why it is valuable.
Virtually none of the information you seek is on this subreddit. Consider this subreddit to be the tabloid of Bitcoin.
You don't have to be a programmer or engineer to follow the development, its pretty clear whats happening.
Coding, building, testing and deploying takes huge numbers of man hours. So relax. It's coming.
In the meantime if you're really concerned go and badger your favourite Bitcoin platforms to implement segwit. That already solves a lot of problems but nobody appears to be demanding it.

But you're missing the point. Outside of the exchange they can't prove you control the keys.
The steps you take outside the exchange determines whether or not something can be "proven".
Most legal systems rely on proof as well as evidence.
I can't recall a single case where proof alone was used against a Bitcoin user. In almost all cases I can recall either the person arrested handed over the coins or the proof was found after their equipment was seized.
Therefore, if no proof can be found it doesn't matter what the exchange has in its records.
Without proof you have plausible deniability and they have no case.
There has never been a case in court to test this because LE knows they can't win and precedent will be set.

Concensus can be reached. The BCH crowd needs to understand that in order for concensusbto be reached sensible public debate is what is needed in order to bring proposals to point where a majority can agree.
All BCH has done is prove just how strong concensus actually was. A weak splinter group created a shitcoin to prove that they had concensus, hardly anyone followed it, thereby proving that hardly anyone wanted what they wanted.
If they were right, Bitcoin would be the minority fork right now. Which it isn't.
The majority stuck with Bitcoin, therefore a majority concensus was found.
The miners argument is weak as F as well as miners are in business to make money, they will mine whatever makes the most profit. Very few miners care about the long term.
This is an understandable approach because they invest heavily in kit, power and space. They have to make money.

I just want to get segwit moving now on BTC. We need to start pushing that to sort out scaling.
We have our solution, we now need to encourage vendors etc use it.
If we don't we will constantly be up against big blockers because it will always appear to the less technically minded that big blocks are the better solution since more = better is easier to understand.
While a blocksize increase on Bitcoin is inevitable, I'd rather it happened later rather than sooner and start the ball rolling on LN and segwit.
The trouble with increasing block size is it just sweeps a problem further down the road and as adoption picks up the block size will have to be increased more and more frequently.
What happens when 2mb isnt enough? 4mb isnt enough? And so on.
I could be wrong, but it doesnt seem like a long term solution to me.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:58:55
The size on disk isnt really the problem as far as I see it. The problem is bandwidth. Then again, I'm a network guy. I'm more interested in getting nodes set up and synchronised faster. The problem I'm trying to attack is "how do I get the data there" rather than "what do I do once its there".
Diskspace is cheap and can be shared locally. Bandwidth isn't.
It's already possible to compress the throughput with a cheap VPS and some proxying / caching. You can use a $5 Digital Ocean instance as your gateway and compress everything that comes downstream.
You could probably do it with a remotely hosted Pi as well. Or both.
I.e. use a Pi as a local gateway / cache / distribution node and a Droplet as a remote gateway / cache.
I'm still refining it, but as soon as I have a workable reproducable solution i'll publish here. Assuming I reach that stage.
Im trying to stick to a pure open source based solution avoiding proprietary scripts and techbwhere possible.
What I don't know and struggle to fathom is the impact this would have if it became widespread since you're technically adding latency and to a certain extent centralisation (if you share).
At the moment my solution isn't really workable for the masses as it requires some technical knowledge of networking and Linux to get it going. But if I can make it easily deployable of course I'll share it.
@_date: 2019-02-11 13:26:02
Or start a shop in Pantip Plaza.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:31:44
To be honest, I think it goes hand in glove. Saving bandwidth and disk space don't have to be mutually exclusive.
Nor does it have to be an ongoing process at node level.
I think right now, if we can shorten the time it takes to just prime a node, we're making interesting steps.
At the moment, it can take some people weeks (or months if they have a bandwidth cap at their ISP).
If you stay just a single block behind to just prime the nodes then let the nodes catch themselves up naturally (via a compressed link / proxy) you're saving huge amounts of resources.
Not only that, you can keep things incredibly simple.
Kinda like old school store and forward SMTP.
Another step that needs some considering is the indexing step. Not many people consider that. It's very attractive to be able to run a full node on a low power device like a Pi, but even when you iron out disk space use and bandwidth use, you still have a CPU bottleneck for indexing!
I've never run a node on a low power CPU, so I can't even imagine how slow it is, I've only ever messed about with Xeons and powerful multicore setups. Even then, it can be like pulling teeth!
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:21:03
There is no trust on first use. Every node is self verifying.
If you synchronised 100% horseshit the node wouldn't verify it.
Also, if you pushed 100% horseshit you'd be blacklisted from the network pretty damned quick.

Bitcoin isn't the problem here...it is basically anonymous.
The problem is KYC and AML bullshit forcing you to hand over your personal details.
That is what makes this swoop easy for the IRS...
I think a fair compromise here for the US citizens would be the ability to claim inflation as a loss. Because technically it is.
If you can be taxed on your Bitcoin gains, why can't you claim the drop in value due to inflation as a loss on dollars.
On the flipside, if you're only taxed when you exit bitcoin perhaps this will encourage people to save into then spend Bitcoin rather than cash out to fiat?

Yeah some manufacturers used to use custom adapters to make their laptops thinner. The disk is a standard disk.
A USB converter is about £8. Cheap.
The difficulty is in getting the recovery right. A disk that old has risk attached to it.
There's a good chance it's fine and will be a straight forward job, but there's also a chance that a combination of age and sitting around for ages may have made the disk unreliable.
If you're somewhere around London UK (within a reasonable distance), I'd be happy to help. I have all the appropriate kit and I do this kind of thing for a living.

That looks like a PATA drive with some sort of adapter on it. You'll need a USB to PATA adapter to read from it. You'll also need to remove that adapter.
If the disk is readable, your coins can probably be recovered.
Ironically, recovering this disk is trivial for a technical person to recover (like me) but potentially difficult for a none technical person.
If you get an adapter, I'd recommend getting a write blocker too and take an image of the drive, then attempt recovery from the image.
The write blocker is just a precautionary measure to ensure the integrity of the data on the drive...you don't want to accidentally overwrite something or trigger a format...a write blocker will prevent this.

Lots of people save because they believe the high interest rates on savings accounts are worth it. I've seen savings accounts (or money market accounts as they call them) at 7% or more.
But when you factor in inflation and the dropping exchange rate, even at 7% you make a loss.

Agreed. With a commission on successful trades. Though I would open source the code and leave out the secret sauce.
It's possible to open source a trading bot without giving away the parameters.
Even if you did disclose the parameters, automatic trading is an arms race, it has more to do with the underlying infrastructure than the actual algorithm.
If you've already got the low latency infrastructure, a competitor would need more than just your code to compete.
Slippage is your biggest enemy in automated trading. The time it takes to actually execute a trade and respond to the signals. In this situation you're up against other bits, not really the market itself. The market is what it is. As long as there is movement, money can be made.
Literally billions are spent on reducing latency from data centres to trading floors just get the competitive edge.
The only exception to this being an algorithm that has high success rates on commodity hardware that isn't affected by latency...an algorithm that can see into the future...fun fact, that's not a thing.
Let the traders take the risk. A solid trading bot is only the cherry on top. The underlying infrastructure is the meat and guts.
So for scams like this one, you need only figure out what infrastructure they have.

Firstly, Bacon with a "B". Have some respect, man.
Secondly, nope.
Thousands of people have spent many years researching and experimenting. Seeking the answers to questions that may explain the origin of all things and unravel universal truths.
Billions of dollars, countless failures and set backs.
The culmination of all this gruelling work is that the internet has no religion and that Bacon (actual Bacon) is the breakfast meat of the Internet.
Religious people have club houses and medieval stone sheds to eat vegan bullshit in. Often surrounded by hundreds of years worth of corpses.
As for me...It's Sunday. Time for Bacon and other associated foods...on my deck in the garden.
Not at a medieval stone bunker surround by the dead drinking metaphorical human blood and flesh.

The difference is, if someone decides to throw a lot of money at it, it benefits everyone not just the whale.
For example.
If a person throws £1million at a bank it only benefits the investor and the bank.
Everyone else gets the same interest, security, guarantees no matter how much money is piled in.
If a person throws £1million at Bitcoin (be it mining, buying bitcoin, setting up nodes etc), it benefits everyone (greater hashing power, more nodes, value increase etc).
So yeah, more cash buys you a bigger slice of the pie, but has the knock on effect of boosting everyone. No matter who they are, where they are or how much they have invested.
Also, my understanding is, Bitcoin isn't about destroying financial elites. It's about breaking the financial system and regaining some control. Making the system less unfair in terms of control, not distribution.

It's no worse than cash for consumers. It's not the responsibility of the financial platform to protect consumers.
Common sense and consumer law is there to protect consumers.
The major difference with Bitcoin is that you can *prove* you handed over the cash. Whereas with regular cash it's your word against the merchants.
If anything Bitcoin is *better* for the consumer because you can contest a transaction without a third party corporation being involved. You can go straight to the courts.

Never ceases to amaze me how dumb people are are. All transactions are publically viewable on the ledger.
If your coins are stolen, post the TXID...people here can then follo a hats going on and maybe, if you're lucky,help retrieve your coins.
The sooner you post the transactions the sooner people can follow the stolen coins and the easier they become to follow.

BCH will get forked into oblivion.
Their entire community is made of people that can't reach consensus.
As for Craig S Wright, he is incapable of intelligent and rational debate (if you think otherwise, just watch some of his talks and appearances on YouTube, the dude is garbage). This is why he always goes down the route of hard forking. No need to be articulate and knowledgeable if you can just fork the code right?
Sure, changes come relatively slowly in the Bitcoin realm (or at breakneck speed if you compare to other technologies), but the pace of change in Bitcoin is a positive thing. It keeps the network safe, solid and secure.
If I were a bcasher right now, I'd be starting to feel the burn. If I had a shred of intelligence, I'd be realising that all the fervour, shilling and so called loyalty has led to yet another hard fork.

Yes I'm building a lightning explorer and I've noticed this.
Most of the explorers out there count offline nodes and nodes with no channels.
They're basically displaying all of the nodes their node has ever seen vs nodes that are currently active via network gossip.
That said, there are probably hundreds of nodes with no channel that arent detected via network gossip.
My explorer will most likely only report nodes with open channels.
I'm also looking at distributing the stats contribution.
Is that something people here running nodes would be interested in contributing to?
I.e. run a simple agent that pushes out your local node statistics (anonymously) to a central stats dump for a more accurate explorer?

No worries. I don't really mind FUD because it presents an opportunity for clear explanation...I think most people here would agree with that.
It's repetition of the same crap that is a problem because it is done deliberately to bury the sound explanations since it takes a lot more time to explain something than it does to repeatedly shitpost.
The mods probably have a hard time with this as if they delete repetitive FUD it could be seen as censorship (which is what common garden variety bcashers accuse the mods of here).
That said, the more people we can provide explanation to, the less likely it is that FUD will be taken seriously and less crap the mods will have to filter.

Yes, good. But it's only 9 years old. Fiat is thousands of years old.
Replacing a monetary system isn't like updating a website with the latest version of Wordpress.
Stability comes from widespread adoption. Widespread adoption comes from saturation. Saturation comes from high value.
All of these take time.
The higher the price, the wider Bitcoin can (and will be) distributed.
It's far easier to distribute a single Bitcoin worth $1million than it is to distribute a single Bitcoin that is worth $10,000.
The higher the price goes, the greater the number of people that can come along and buy it.
For arguments sake, lets say the circulation of Bitcoin is 100. So in our imaginary world. There are no more than 100 bitcoins.
At $1 a coin, its easy for fewer people to own the lot and thus very hard for millions of people to own a fraction.
If each coin is worth $1million, a small cohort would need $100million to own the lot. Thus, it becomes harder for fewer people to own swathes of Bitcoin but easier for millions of individuals to buy a smaller slice...saturation.
This is also why the recent drop is a good thing. People shorting Bitcoin are distributing it. It is changing hands and probably being broken down into smaller fractions as they sell off. A few alts here, couple of dollars there. One person distributing to several people...growth.
Once you have millions of people on board, they want to be able to use it or leverage it. Now the adoption starts...as the number of people holding Bitcoin grows, the motivation to accept it grows. Businesses aren't stupid. They will go where the customers are. Right now, Bitcoin is undervalued and thus not held by enough people, therefore it presents a relatively small market to a business.
Its a tricky, long, growth process, but we'll get there.

"cannot exist under the laws of the EU"
Well then, since Europe runs the whole world...
Seriously though...anyone publishing personal information to an immutable blockchain should understand that they're creating a permanent record. The onus is on them.
Most courts base judgements on the basis of what a person may find to be reasonable. I.e. law is interpreted it is not taken literally unless its an extreme case.
That's why case law generally leans on precedent.
Prosecuting someone is akin to fitting a square peg in a round hole. E.g. the law will clearly state the rules, whereas a crime might vaguely fit some of those rules.
In the world of criminal law there are two things that need to be clear. Mens rea and actus reus. I.e. did someone do it, and did they intend to carry out a crime?
In the case of holding a copy of a blockchain, all you can prove is that they have a copy of the blockchain. You can't prove that they intended to commit a crime on the strength of them simply having a copy of the blockchain and in pretty much all cases, the holder of the copy intends to commit no crime.
Therefore, a sound judge and a crew of intelligent lawyers would not pass a judgement against the use and/or ownership of a copy of an immutable blockchain via GDPR.
Finally, is GDPR a threat? No. GDPR is a regulatory framework (the hint is in the name) designed to help organisations and individuals understand what data they can hold, how long they hold it and the rights of the people the data came from.
This is sensationalist bollocks. The author of this article is a twat and doesn't understand how the law works and can't tell the difference between a criminal law and a regulatory act.

Yeah the estimated cost is low. But actually gathering that hashing power is insanely hard.
If you were to simply try and buy the kit to get that hashing power, you'd have nowhere to put it, nor would you have a power source capable of juicing it.
If you tried to rent it, you wouldn't find enough. There's nowhere you could enter your credit card to buy that much hashing power. 51% of the network is not available for rent.
The cost on that site is representative of the distributed cost of that hashing power, it's not representative of the cost of executing a plan to deploy it.
I suspect the actual cost would be orders of magnitude higher. If a 51% attack was likely, we'd have seen one already.
Moreover, if a government was seen to be planning or executing an attack on Bitcoin, it would irreparable damage trust in that countries government and expose them as weak and afraid. Not traits an average person wants to see in a government.
Furthermore, a government exists to enforce the will of its citizens. I don't think there's a "people" that wants their government to prioritise killing Bitcoin.
People want healthcare reform, crime reduced, pot holes filled and fat cats to pay more tax...
Unless the fat cats jumped ship into Bitcoin, Bitcoin poses no threat to the man on the street.
Finally, in the overwhelming majority of nations, monetary policy has nothing to do with the government, it's an entirely separate (and independent) arm of the nation.

Dip, dive, crash whatever you want to call it. Its all the same.
Based on the size of this &lt;insert favourite word&gt;. People will be looking for bigger dips in the future.
People buying the dip were used to minor swings here and there, now though we've seen how far a drop can go and how far a real bull run can go. In my opinion, in the future people will wait longer to get back in and the bull runs will be sharper because we have new players in the market.
Therefore, what we're seeing will henceforth be what people may expect fro a dip.
The people taking Bitcoin seriously and trading for a living are not Dave from the pub, or Joe that sold his house to buy Bitcoin. They are smart, they are tough, they are ruthless and more importantly they can afford to watch people burn. They have time and money.
What we're seeing is a test of the market. We now have institutional players on the field. They aren't fucking about. They're here to make money and they don't care who they shaft to do it.
Theres no mysticism here, theres no obscure reason for whats going on. We're seeing people that know what they're doing operating in a market that doesnt have them chained down by regulation.
Bitcoin is not a niche investment anymore, its a wide open market that ruthless and unscrupulous people can manipulate.
As sad as I am to say it, we may actually need the exchanges to be regulated to a certain extent.
Bottom line for all those looking for some sort of answer.
Bitcoin is not dead, far from it. Its swinging like a bipolar neurotic teenager because it is being manipulated. This happens in all markets. Bitcoin isn't even technically complete yet. Its still a shell on bricks in a garage being built, it's at Version 0.15 (soon to be 0.16) ffs. We havent even reached a major build number yet.
Of course, I am not an expert, this is my current opinion, it may change tomorrow...I just prefer to hold a sort of pragmatic view.

Indeed. I've flirted with many ideas. There's a few insane things I'd do with massive Bitcoin profits.
I'd buy all my cheese from Fortnum and Mason, but eat it with bread from Tesco. I'd pretend I buy the Tesco bread because I have some sort of insight into the baking process and use the Fortnum and Mason angle to suggest I'm a connessieur.
There's a fine Speyside Glenlivet 40 year old single malt in Fortnum at the moment for £2,500. I'd buy that and drink it out of a coffee mug (so as to remove the pretensiousness) and serve it with After Eights chocolates. That way, if people see me, they'll know I bought it specifically because it was expensive not because it's an excellent whisky because the After Eights will trash the flavour.
You see, I don't think any has really explored the outer limits of what it is to be a rich twat. I'd like to break new ground.

I know right!
People are more concerned about short term growing pains than what this technology can potentially bring.
Believe me, engineers like myself are extremely excited and we're already trying to figure this stuff out.
Best of all, most of these innovations will be completely transparent to the user.
Thats the beauty of Blockchain, you will ultimately be more care free because you will have to trust less third parties.
Or more accurately, you'll care about other more important things.
Blockchain makes complex processes a lot more transparent and more fluid. Especially when you stack them or inter-connect them.
Imagine not having to worry about whether your money is appropriately divided for your household budget for example.
You could have software that tracks which food is currently in season (based on crop reports broadcast to a blockchain prividing useful data like harvest projections, crop yields etc) and a nutritional blockchain that has kept a tab on your personal nutrient levels (which your GP can access and use to prescribe supplements / dietary changes to fix a deficiency before you're aware of it), which in turn links to your favourite grocery store who receive an order on their blockchain. Finally, using a series of Lightning Channels payment can be reconciled across all the points in this chain that are chargeable).
Once ordered, an app on your phone could use your grocery order history from the grocery blockchain, examine it and determine the most cost effective way to use those ingredients and schedule recipes in your calendar according to nutritional balance and the shelf life of the food.
Following a week of recipes you could rate each recipe, the data from which could be stored on a blockchain to help catalogue your tastes and preferences and influence this whole process in the future.

No, it is not a bank in the modern sense.
Think of it as a bank in the Wild West sort of sense.
It's a crappy wooden hut, in a small town with a vault in it.
It's all fine and dandy until a bunch of bandits ride into town and drag the safe out of the building and run off with it.
Then following the heist, they can't repay you or guarantee anything because everything they had was in the safe.
They are custodians that offer zero guarantees.
Storing your crypto there is the same as handing your cash to a stranger and trusting him to look after it for a while.
The stranger might be trustworthy and give your money back when asked, but he also might rob you blind.
Hence all the noise about moving funds to your own keys. It's the community way of weeding out the rogues.
That said, just because a rogue wasn't caught this time, it doesn't mean they won't ever be caught.

I agree the barrier to entry is very low in terms of beating Bitcoin.
A competing crypto would just need to deploy more ATMs, be more widely accepted and recognised, have satellites in space broadcasting their Blockchain, have a significantly higher user base than 5.8 million people and be at least as revolutionary.

Well all you'd need to do is check all known derivation paths. The used keys will be determined.
I'm not entirely sure I understand what you're trying to do.
Deriving public keys from a seed is precisely what wallets do.

Using shear statistics the average Bitcoin user is:
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:54:39
More or less. I dismiss price predictions (such as the one linked here) that are entirely baseless.
If the prediction includes some sort of verifiable insight into how they reached their figure then I throw it on the pile and see how it affects the average.
Right now, my average price prediction list is saying $15,000 by end of March / early April and approximately $30k for Christmas with moderate dips in May and September.
Last year was all about $10k by Christmas. Which if you disregard the mania following breaking the $10k threshold, leaves us $1,600 below last years sensible expectation. So even though we've dropped 60% from the ATH, we're only $1,600 below where we expected to be. Not bad.
If we repeat the 2017 action and our expectation consistently hovers around $30k, with a burst of mania we could probably expect twice that at least to be the 2018 ATH.

Ok chill...
You don't need diagrams for the predictions you made. We'll probably see retracements at most of the $1000-ish limits, until we reach somewhere round tje ath again...it's the healthy way to grow. Unless we get some outrageously good news we won't see a massive spike again soon.
One correct prediction isnt impressive. A fucked clock is right twice a day.
What would be impressive is if you kept a log of your predictions (along with trade history associated with your own advice) and you managed to be right 60% or more of the time. I'd watch you like a hawk.
I personally only take TA seriously if the advisor follows his own advice and has a proven track record of trades.
Admittedly I use TA myself occasionally, but usually only if I havent a clue whats going on and my gut is going bonkers.
I've been around since 2012, I've seen technical analysts come and go.
What drives me nuts is that the average TA guy celebrates when hes right, but never addresses when hes wrong...which is just as valuable! Why did the market make an unexpected change?
Look at this guy...
He thought he'd spotted a 60 day cycle. Technically his predictions were right, we are on a normal cycle, but he was ultimately wrong about the 60 day window but he never addressed why (which is just as valuable in my opinion)...he simply moved onto another pair...some shitcoin vs BTC.

Price does not reflect value. Price reflects what people are willing to pay, value is determined based on the leverage / benefit one attains from the price paid.
I.e. if I pay $10 (price) for a spanner and I get paid $1,000 (value) to do an odd job as a result of having the right spanner, the value of the spanner is $1000 to me but the price was $10.
The odd job cost a person $1,000 for me to perform and it may have been $200 cheaper for me to do the job as a favour therefore to him the work may have had a value of $1,200.

Actually, the point of money is to temporarily store value and allow you to transport it to the point of your next transaction.
It's to save us having to move chickens, live stock and so on in order to trade.
Money wasn't invented to have value, it was invented to tokenise and represent value and to make value easier to move and divide.
Chickens: Hard to divide, transport and value directly proportional to the number of other people that rock up chickens therefore scarcity unlikely. Perishable. Decentralised.
Gold: Slightly easier, but still difficult to transport, scarce, but hard to divide. Non perishable. Difficult to counterfeit. Centralised.
Fiat: Relatively easy to transport compared to gold but bulky, easy to divide, not very scarce, can be produced ad infinitum. Non perishable. Can be counterfeited. Centralised.
Digital Fiat: All of the above fiat attributes above, except very easy to transport, but requires third party involvement to transact.
Bitcoin: Easy to transport, scarce, easy to divide. Impossible to counterfeit. Decentralised.  No third parties.
Bitcoin. It's a good thing. All the benefits of previous generations and then some, none of the drawbacks.

Right dip shit, this is what a Bitcoin loan would look like if I wanted to make approx 3.5% out of you over a year.
Situation: I lend you 1 Bitcoin for 12 months based on annual deflation of 3% with a 3.5% adjustment for profit.
12 monthly repayments (calculated using a rate of deflation relative to the rate of deflation I've calculated to profit from the loan).
1. 0.08750000
2: 0.08728125
3: 0.08706305
4: 0.08684539
5: 0.08662828
6: 0.08641171
7: 0.08619568
8: 0.08598019
9: 0.08576524
10: 0.08555083
11: 0.08533695
12: 0.08512361
Total Loaned: 1.00000000
Total Repaid: 1.03568218
Not only have I made a profit, but I've kept your payments at a relative level so vs your income, they are basically the same value, just different amounts.
Notice how each payment gets smaller each month, thats because of the relative deflation of Bitcoin.
If I held 1 Bitcoin, after 12 months, I'd still have 1 Bitcoin. Whereas if I lent it to you, I'd gain more value than deflation alone would give me.
Yet, you've still had the benefit of an upfront Bitcoin and each monthly payment has the same relative value (whatever that means in a Bitcoin only world).
Why is this so abstract to you?
It's clear as day to me. Mathematically, I can deflate your payments and still inflate my end result.
My formula even works over different periods of lending:
1 Bitcoin over 24 months based on a fixed 3% deflation adjusted for 3.5% a year:
1. 0.04583333
2: 0.04571875
3: 0.04560445
4: 0.04549044
5: 0.04537671
6: 0.04526327
7: 0.04515011
8: 0.04503723
9: 0.04492464
10: 0.04481233

Notice, no matter what happens, no matter how I stretch the time period, I always make a profit, the payments always decrease slightly over time, but you always get the benefit of a Bitcoin up front that you otherwise wouldn't have had.
Now what you will notice is that deflationary economics incentivises borrowing over longer periods, because the monthly payments are more affordable. Even though the loan is more expensive.
Is this clear enough for you now? Or are you still going to tell me it's impossible to make money lending Bitcoin?
This is just one model, there are plenty of others (which are admittedly a lot more complex and less practical, but it can be done).

I don't think the energy consumption of Bitcoin is a concern, what is a concern is how we produce energy and what we build tonconsume that energy.
If you consider that theres enough solar energy hitting earth to produce around 1kW per m2, theres freakin' tons of energy we can harness.
Trouble is investment in renewables is woefully bad.
Theres also very little investment in researching energy efficiency.
The vast majority of energy consumed is probably wasted. I'm not aware of an electrical device that doesn't generate some heat...that heat is wasted energy.
Admittedly we are getting better at producing energy efficient computing chips, but we're still miles off a decent level of efficiency.
The best way to visualise how we use electricity is to imagine filling a glass up with water using a high pressure water hydrant and trying not to spill anything.

Are you sure? Some stats suggest that wallets containing greater than 9.5-10 BTC are in the top 0.5% bracket.
I seriously doubt the average hodler has tens of Bitcoin.
I think the overwhelming majority of people have less than quarter of a Bitcoin. Hodlers above that are either people that bought loads within the last year or are long term early adopters.
I think a larger than you'd expect number of early adopters are still around and still hodling but the amount they hold is considerably less than people like to think.

No I'm saying lending will become a social thing rather than an institutional thing.
We're seeing society moving towards this model right now with the gig economy and services like Uber.
At the moment though our slow move into decentralising everything is having to straddle the old way of doing things as well as the new way of doing things.
E.g. Uber.
That is a decentralised collective of cabbies, but due to regulation and so forth, it has to be centralised (taxi licenses etc).
Same thing applies to Fiverr et al. Decentralised work force which is managed via centralised market place.
These things can easily be decentralised if regulation were to be adjusted.
Look at BISQ. A decentralised Crypto exchange. Theres no reason that model can't be applied to the gig economy, lending platform etc.
I see lending in the future as being purely a short term thing. I don't see how mortgages would be possible.
Mortgages and long term loans are a product of inflation.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ��
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick &amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ��

No. You see, you're applying the mentality of the current system to a completely different system. Thats why it sounds crazy.
If one person turns up at the office dressed like a pirate, he's a lunatic. If everyone turns up dressed like a pirate, he's sane.
You can't see beyond the way things are.
If we lived in a purely Bitcoin oriented world, I'd "lend" you a small percentage of my BTC on the proviso (baked into a smart contract) that you reserved a small percentage of that Bitcoin and "lent" it to others following the same conditions I set up. I'd release the funds in accordance to additional contracts you set up with other third parties only filtering down, never up or sideways. This is possible with a public ledger because I can see where the coins have gone and to whom you have a contract with.
In fact, I could base your "creditworthiness" on the likelihood that you'd actually follow through based on previous performance.
It is advantageous to me to give you bitcoin and contract you to lend out a small percentage. 
Sure, I'd be holding less Bitcoin, but ensuring that ever smaller fractions of it get distributed far and wide pushes up the value of the Bitcoin I still hold. I gain from lending. Which is the purpose of lending...right?
I don't need you to pay me back (that would be entirely at your discretion), I just need to ensure that you also lend out.
Even if I don't share, I still win because others will.
This is just one of the ways lending can work in a Bitcoin centric system and alas, it only works if fiat dies.
There are many, many other approaches.
They just require a different mindset.
All that matters in the world of lending is that some form of benefit can be expected.
It doesnt have to rebound directly off the person that you lent to. It can be purely environmental.

Depends on the deal the service staff get. I think if tipping were to become arbitrary, I'd like to know the establishments that don't look after their service staff.
Im reluctant to pay a tip if the staff are well paid or the owner is a douchebag that takes a cut.
Ironically, if an establishment was open about underpaying / not paying the staff as is rife in the US, I wouldn't go in because it's plain wrong.
The service staff contribute just as much as a top chef does to a restaurant / bar plus they have to handle situations where people get out of hand / are extremely drunk.
What good is a top notch meal if the service is shit?
Same goes for charging staff to eat at the place they work at.
If they've never tried / can't afford to try the food, how can they make an informed recommendation?
Same goes for wine pairings, I'd wager restaurants lose a fortune there. If people don't know which wine to pick, I guarantee they will pick the appropriate colour wine and get the second cheapest.
The number of times I've seen people buying a crap pinot grigio or cheap flavourless chardonnay to pair with excellent seafood is insane.
Makes me want to go full Ramsay and stand up, flip the table, walk over, pick up a mussel off one of their plates, wave it around and shout "a dry South African chenin blanc is better with those mussels you fucking savages" look the lady at the table in the eye and calmly say "this man is a cheapskate, leave now" then throw the mussel back on the plate and swipe everything off the table. Crouch down, facepalm a little then cool off, pay both bills, definitely leave a large tip, and wait to be kicked out.
But then, I might just be an arsehole.
If the staff are capable of recommending a solid pairing, all this drama can be avoided and I can enjoy my meal in peace.

As is the case with a large scale commercial loan in our world, I'd be a stakeholder in the business until such a time that the original equity (the relative value, plus deflationary offset as a sweetener) can be released from the business, or I can simply buy you out. 
Depending on how hostile I am of course.
If we wanted to structure some sort of repayment scheme over a given time period (assuming cashflow is present) the repayments would look different to our current system.
For a start we have to take into account deflation in order for the repayments to have relative value. So repayments would get smaller over time but have the same relative value. E.g. 1 bitcoin today may have the same relative value as 0.99 bitcoin next year. Therefore your repayments would drop 1% over the course of a year.
We'd have to agree a time period for the loan and calculate a realistic rate of deflation over that period of time (this is where I'm taking a calculated risk).
For a return on my investment I'm looking for relative value not an absolute value. So over the course of the loan I might be looking to earn 1BTC on top of my original 50BTC. That 1BTC can be taken into account in the repayments.
Using the agreed rate of deflation, we apply a relative increase to each payment.
At the end of the term, I have my original investment back, plus an additional bitcoin with additional value relative to deflation.
Its not difficult to picture a simple loan with deflstionary features. It just depends on the rate of deflation.
I think the main problem people have visualising this kind of setup is because of deflation, the underlying asset that you'd usually secure the loan against would deflate over time meaning if you had to liquidate it, you'd get slightly less than the original investment back. Based on current deflation, that could be devastating.
However, you can't base how the deflation in the future will be based on todays market. We have extreme volatility right now and low saturation. We won't have extreme volatility forever. Deflation won't be massive once Bitcoin has reached a wider level of saturation. In the same way (in stable economies) we don't see hyper inflation.

I somewhat agree. As far as user experience goes it's more of an educational problem than an actual design problem.
The trouble with anything new and technical is that people feel the need to understand it rather than just use it. At least that's the problem I see.
When a person is issued with a contactless debit card from the bank, they don't ask how it works or worry about how the money moves. They just bonk the card and a payment is made.
However, with Bitcoin people feel they need to understand all of the technical aspects before they use it. The same thing applies to a lot of tech in general as well.
Imagine applying this thought process to other factors that are common in life and you realise how dumb it is.
Like driving for example. Did you need to understand how a drive chain works to pass your driving test? Does knowing how a turbo injector works make you a better driver? The answer in all cases is no.
Imagine breaking down the steps involved in conventional banking in minute detail.
You have to pick up you car keys, walk out the front door, get in the car, drive to town, walk up the high street, queue in the bank, speak to the teller, hand over your cash, take a receipt, walk back down the high street, pay for your parking, walk to your car, get in, drive home, open your front door, to inside, sit down, relax.
Most people will summarise that and remove the complexity..."all I have to do is go to the bank and hand over my cash". People don't do this with Lightning/Bitcoin.
To summarise Lightning, the same way an average pleb summarises conventional banking...you just download a wallet and put cash in it. Then you can spend wherever it's accepted.
In terms of widespread availability, Bitcoin is comparable to American Express (outside the US). Most places don't accept it, but in the case of Bitcoin it's not because it's expensive or difficult, it's because back office services like accountants don't understand it yet. 
My previous accountant was entirely oblivious to Bitcoin other than the odd bit of media coverage. They weren't even aware of the government rules around it.
Moreover, you have to rethink how an EPOS system works. I'm currently developing one suitable for small businesses (it's slow going, but it'll get there).
There are already solutions out there, but they're freakishly expensive and have some serious drawbacks from a security perspective and generally, you are not the custodian of the Bitcoin wallet.
Based on all of this, the growth of the Lightning network is astonishing so far.
If it keeps going at this rate, it'll be massive in a few years.

I suspect this prediction is based on GPU mined coins getting harder to mine and eventually being mined with ASICs / FPGAs.
Either that or we have some sort of turber nutter nitrous mining hardware around the corner that they know about but we don't.
Most likely its because there will be a glut of high end cards on the second hand market by next year. Maybe.
Or perhaps because interest rates are about to go up it'll become unprofitable for Joe Miner to mine.

Well ok, but also for crypto it has a well documented random number generator and entropy algorithm which is constantly being improved and hardened.
We know virtually nothing about Microsofts rng or sources used for their entropy.
If you know what is used to create entropy, you can stir the pot and create better entropy.
Pretty hard to stir a pot you can't see.
Also, since we know virtually nothing, we can't possibly know if their algorithm is compromised or crippled in any way. i.e. backdoored / deliberately weakened.
If you trust a closed random source of entropy, frankly, you're a fucking idiot. 
Especially since this is used to help generate your private keys and wallet addresses. The less entropy you have or the more predictable it is, the more exposed you are.
If you're going to do anything cryptographic avoid closed proprietary tech. Nuff said.

In the case of a mechanic (which is a bad example), Id ask for sufficient information to get a second opinion. Most (reputable) mechanics will give you a diagnostic print out for this purpose. I don't need to understand the mechanic to make an informed choice. I just need to consult more than one expert to see if the advice matches up.
I also wouldn't try and fix my own car. I'm not a mechanic, nor am I deluded enough to think "that fix sounds simple enough, I'll give it a crack".
Yeah I get the Newtonian Mechanics angle, but it doesn't change the fact your advice was shit.
Most phone pwnage happens when the device is unlocked. Via rogue apps, dodgy texts, malicious JS via browser etc. 
Also, while the phone is unlocked the device is decrypted and in a lot of cases apps (possibly the wallet app) can be running in the background. If the wallet app is running, the keys are exposed and any number of vectors can be used to swipe those keys from memory.
Not all mobile devices are built equally, not all of them good memory management that auto kills background processes.
For all you know this guy could be rocking a $35 Alcatel land fill Android running a generations old release of the OS which is unpatched. He might be running a rooted OS with dodgy compromised sideloaded apps. His phone might already be infected without his knowledge.

Not at all.
What I'm saying is, that building a fiat based transactional system on top of a fiat based transactional system meets less resistance due to it not actually being a new system at all.
All m-pesa has done is introduce a new third party into the loop. It's not new.
Instead of dealing with banks directly, m-pesa users are dealing with Vodafone...who in turn deal with the bank.
It's no different to how broadband providers work.
E.g. here in Blighty, the vast majority of the broadband infrastructure is owned and maintained by British Telecom.
You can get a connection straight from BT, or you can go through a third party who buy access to the BT infrastructure at wholesale prices.
If you go via a third party, like Plusnet, you may think you're dealing with a distinct entity but in fact you are still effectively using BT since Plusnet doesn't own the infrastructure, BT does.
Same thing applies to services like m-pesa. It seems like a novel idea and outside of the scope of traditional banking, but in reality it is underpinned by and can only exist because of traditional banking.
If you think about it, m-pesa is a great way for banks to escape the risks and costs associated with holding an individuals money, since they get to hold the money (via Vodafone) but have no duty of care to the end m-pesa user. A bankers wet dream.

Right now, people are asking me if we've hit the bottom yet...to which I respond "I've no idea, nobody knows" then they usually indicate either a desire to buy Bitcoin or mine it (usually asking if it can be done on a phone or laptop).
I have noted that a not insignificant portion would rather have simple exposure to Bitcoin rather than have the stress of having to manage their coins...a bit like futures, but more like the system Revolut has.
When I show these people that you can flick back and forth at will on Revolut, they shit their pants and dive straight in as it gives them the reassurance that they can get out whenever they wish without having to faff about without having to transfer anything around.
I strongly believe that the exchanges are part of the problem. Its a high barrier to entry for average people with no trading experience. Plus you have the agro of sending your ID documents, verifying your bank details, understanding miners fees etc. This is daunting to most people...not only because its confusing but also because some of the Exchanges are based in obscure countries e.g. Bitstamp.
These usually involve using bank features and services people aren't generally familiar with like IBAN numbers and Swift.
Hell, a lot of bank accounts don't have Swift or IBAN numbers. Especially if its just a cash account.
On the flipside, you can be up and running on Revolut within minutes. You can have all those details or just use their crypto feature. With the added bonus of being able to draw down at a regular ATM whenever you feel like it.
That's why I think the money being traded and driving the price isn't Joe Public.
Dave at the pub just wants to invest. He doesn't necessarily want to own it because of the risks and barriers (wallet security, learning how to use a wallet etc).
This is where hodlers come in. The more Bitcoin that is shorted by hodlers and put into the hands of the institutions, the less influence we have as a whole in the market.
I've said it a few times on here, collectively this subreddit is an uber whale.
If we all bought an average of $20 of Bitcoin once a month within a short space of time on the same day, we could have a serious impact.
There are 600,000+ of us. Thats $12million dollars (on average). Who on Earth could consistently match that month on month in a short space of time?
Thats over 10% of the current 24hr volume on Bitfinex.
Pretty certain there are no individuals out there accounting for a whole 10% of the daily volume of a single exchange.
This subreddit needs to declare a specific day for people to buy en masse.
We talk a big game here, but as a community we appear to do very little.

You can get a return for it. Its simple maths.
In the future we won't have deflation at the same rate we have now.
The only difference betweeb a traditional loan and a deflationary loan will be the way repayments work.
They get smaller over time but track slightly lower than deflation.
If you lend 1 BTC its possible to make enough BTC to beat deflation over time if the deflation rate is in single digits without financially ruining someone.
The only difference is inflation.
With a traditional loan the interest rate takes into account inflation over a given number of years and then some.
E.g. inflation runs at around 3% but interest on loans is usually between 10-20%
Lets say our deflation rate on Bitcoin is eventually 3%.
If we lend out Bitcoin we simply need to ensure our investment deflates at a rate that is less.
So we lend out at 2% deflation and gradually reduce the repayments by that much to take into account deflation to make the repayments affordable. This makes lending more affordable for the borrower and it still profitable for the lender.

For example, even though you may be hosted in the US, if you get UK clients, you'd still have to comply with the UK Gambling Commission for example.
Also, most regulators have abclear definition of what is defined as pure gambling and what is defined as "gaming".
TL;DR gambling is where a game is considered to be based around pure "luck" ... I.e. you pay in for a chance to win.
Gaming is defined as a situation where you pay in, but the outcome of your "gamble" as it were, is based on skill.
So...e.g. a paid prize draw is gambling, paying to play whack a mole for a prize is gaming.
Both are regulated quite heavily and licensing is expensive.
There are grey areas though. Like lotteries. There are ways to produce a lottery that stays clear of regulation.
Ive been considering setting up a Bitcoin based lottery for some time. If you're interested DM me.
The struggle with a lottery is, if you want to remain unregulated, you need sponsors or a secondary source of revenue.

Its a hybrid piece of furniture that old ladies hang shitty knickers off that also functions as a vacuum cleaner specifically designed to collect cocaine in its nose piece.
If you try and collect the full set of this furniture the Robbie Williams often refuses to work with the other three pieces. When it does work with the other pieces it has a tendency to cause one of the other pieces to leave.
The only piece that doesn't leave if the Robbie Williams shows up is the Gary Barlow. Presumably because the Gary Barlow is crushingly dull and is made more exciting by the unpredictability of the Robbie Williams.
A Robbie Williams is a bloke your mum would fuck to death even with your Dad in the room, probay because your Dad is too busy talking about boring shit (e.g. Morrisons pies, whippets, woodbines and other miscellaneous boring Northern shit) with Gary Barlow.

So far.
Until an inspector asks why you didn't pay the loan back.
In which case you'll have no legitimate argument.
Doesn't matter if the law doesn't strictly forbid it or explicitely allow it. What matters is your motivation.
If they smell a tax dodging scheme, they will go for you. Especially if it's worth their time.
Even if they lose, it'll cost you a fortune to defend yourself.
Incidentally, in this situation if you used a legit registered accountant, they are usually duty bound to share correspondence and all associated documentation in a court of law. If they don't they run the risk of being struck off the register and losing their livelihood.

Another person that thinks progress in technology and energy production are forever stuck as they are.
In the last 150 years we've moved from burning various animal oils and fossil fuels to nuclear energy, solar power and wind energy.
Sure, progress is relatively slow to the outside observer, but it will continue to progressively improve over time.
Yes, mining uses a lot of energy, but we're becoming progressively better at producing energy. We're also getting better at electrical efficiency. Who knows where we will be in 50 years time?

Funnily enough your shit does have value. Your local authority probably sells it off to be enriched / purified and used as fertiliser or fuel to generate power. You just don't benefit from it directly.
Your pubes are worthless because everyone has pubes. There's a huge amount of them available and there's no functional use for them apart from when I tickle your mum's nose with them.
Just because you don't value something doesn't mean there is no value.
Value isn't always measured using financial metrics either.
Financial metrics are generally used as a way to simplify value for lay people to understand.
E.g. 
Scientist: Using this human shit we can create the energy equivalent of 2 million tonnes of coal.
Dipshit Mortal: Ok but what does that mean?
Scientist: $9.5billion worth of energy.
Dipshit: Well why didn't you fucking say so??
The average person can't fathom the energy output that 2 million tonnes of coal produces...but they can understand that $9.5billion is a heck of a lot.
Similarly, most people can't fathom the intrinsic value of Bitcoin because it isn't easy to measure nor understand at this stage.
It's intrinsic value will be measured based on its impact on society, government, international relations and so on...because it will become intrinsic to the way trade is done or taxes are paid and so on.
We're so far off being able to measure that though, that it's difficult to fathom...but we can see the impact on places like Venezuela...Bitcoin is becoming pretty intrinsic to day to day life over there.

Bitcoin does have an intrinsic value...because you can't produce Bitcoin without energy and you can't manifest Bitcoin out of thin air, you also can't spend it without energy...at the very least it is worth the same as the energy used to produce it.
In fact I reckon Bitcoin has more intrinsic value than any fiat currency because printing bills requires next to nothing to achieve, whereas producing a Bitcoin requires a hell of lot by comparison.

I agree that the keys aren't usually exposed during a phone left, the same can be said of a PC with a correctly configured wallet.
Mobile phones run the same kernels as desktops these days. It's still general purpose. It also takes far longer for exploits to be patched due to OTA updates having a massive lag as they have to get through the manufacturers first. Therefore leaving you exposed for longer.

It is actually illegal, unless you pay back the loan.
The only legal method I'm aware of is the purchasing of assets using the trust, but the trust holds the assets. In which case, you need to verify that your trustees arent bent and that you can pay the annual fees (which are often about the same as the tax in the long run).

Id be wary of any medical blockchain technology that is built by and managed by a central source. If its entirely open source and decentraliser like Bitcoin...brilliant...if its an ICO its a data/cash grab.
I have massive respect for healthcare professionals, you all work your asses off and are grossly underpaid and overworked however, unfortunately centralising medical records has nothing to do with cost effectiveness of the healthcare services. It comes down to what people are comfortable having their private health records stored on.
Look at how Grindr (admittedly not a blockchain company) handled peoples HIV status. They sold the information. Whether it was public information or not, they made a massive error.
I know people that are involved in medical blockchain tech and I can tell you they aren't in it for the benefits to people or medical staff.

The 0.89 was "change". He clearly had all of his Bitcoin in one address.
Think of it like this...
His Bitcoin was like a $10.89 bill, to spend $10 in that bill he has to hand over the full bill and get $0.89 in change.
This is why people recommend using lots of addresses for your Bitcoin. If you use a single address people can see your entire balance when you transact with them.

Yeah, in an extremely vague report.
I know what % goes to Lights, Roads etc...but how is it spent, why do they get that %?
Every time some information is revealed via a freedom of information request you discover that at least some money has been spunked up the wall savings had to be made to paper over the cracks.
To prevent these embarassing revelations, it'd be far more prudent to publish a less vague breakdown of at least the biggest areas of spending.
That way, we can make more informed decisions on who we vote for and taxes can be kept fair.
For example. Paying for roads, lights, healthcare, emergency services...thumbs up!

Perhaps if you started a conversation on the topic of wallet security skewed in the direction you're researching you'd be able to discern so more useful information?
An online survey will never reflect reality...especially if it was posted on Reddit.
Perhaps invite a cohort to an open discussion at a physical location somewhere and have them provide the data you need in return for coffee and muffins.
Do several of them at different locations around your country / region.
There is a reason market research is conducted in this way.

Lightning is a protocol not a software package. The safest and most secure way to use that protocol is with the tools that already exist.
With the tools that exist is a built in JSON API around which it is possible to build a UI.
If you have some ideas about how you think a UI should look for LN and how it should function for people like you. Sketch it, post it online and link it on Reddit.
The trouble with developing a unified "commercial" wallet application is nobody really  knows at this stage what is the best fit for humans since the most common feedback is "I'll wait for a better application", but nobody bothers to define what "better" is.
Functionally, there isn't that much to Lightning. Deposit funds, open channel, raise invoice, pay invoice, close channel, withdraw funds. That is essentially it. The rest is largely optional amd transparent.
As for not having enough knowledge. You don't have to be a Linux kernel developer to be able to install and use a command line tool.
The only difference between a GUI and a command line tool is that a command line tool doesnt present all the options to you at all times and a command line tool depends on your typing accuracy and your ability to think ahead.

This is the backbone of Amazon.

I personally use Amazon because of the insane reliability of their shipping. As a guy that once owned and ran a multi million pound logistics company I can tell you their setup is jaw dropping.

Yes, very good. But bear in mind that the Bitcoin ecosystem outside of Exchanges isn't typically commercial.
Between a vendor and the exchange the infrastructure and software is largely non-commercial and it is typically very difficult to commercialise.
For example, if I build the worlds most fabulous Lightning Wallet, I'd struggle to be able to turn revenue from it since in order to do so, I have to make it closed source and license it.
Being closed source adds an aspect of trust that would otherwise not be there which turns a lot of savvy users off using your product...no matter how straight up you actually are.
Without revenue development of tools, services etc takes a lot longer as you have to rely on the generosity of others.
There is a lot of generosity in the Bitcoin space, but there are far more people simply demanding more progress. This demand requires technical resource both manpower and infrastructure...these are expensive.
Ive built and scrapped numerous projects because I've been unable to sustain them financially and when your motives aren't profit driven it's virtually impossible to attract investors because they want a return on their investment...which is yet another cost.
If it was possible to rely on donations alone, we'd probably see faster progress since people will feasibly be able to dedicate more time to their projects rather than their main source of income.
A lot of us out there are desperate to build and sustain things but we are unequipped financially to do so.
That said, if someone out there wants something developed or some degree of consultancy, I am for hire...DM me.
Or if you're simply feeling generous and just want to dump some money on someone that might just do some good in this space with it. Get in touch.

Craig S Wright is currently the worlds greatest purveyor of the finest, purest, handcrafted, artisnal, organic and gluten free vegan bullshit.
His brand of crap is so pure, science has yet to find a way to quantify and measure it. It defies all known science.
Rumour has it the main problem is the intense smugness surrounding him. In the same way that in quantum physics, the act of observation changes the measurement, observing Wright's crapwave increases his smugness which via some sort of self aggrandising feedback loop changes the purity.
Another problem is, his bullshit can exist in three different quantum states with four possible outcomes that can change upon observation. Either he believes it himself, idiots believe it or nobody believes it or indeed all three simultaneously. If unobserved entirely, then none of these states. A kind of Schrodingers paradox of sorts.
Take for example, a speech he may deliver at a crowded venue typical of him and his associates...lets say one of Roger Vers backyard barbeques, with 5 put of 6 of the chairs occupied. At the time of delivery only Wright believes what he is saying as nobody else there cares (they're chatting amongst themselves enjoying the free booze) and/or they are people paid to be there. However, upon publication of a video to the Internet the state of the bullshit changes because now it has been observed by the people at Ergo due to observation the state is now "some people believe it". Eventually the video will make it to whereupon it is called out as bullshit. Another observation, another change in state. Now nobody believes it because tangentially start talking about censorship, satoshis vision, fees etc therefore no longer acknowledging the bullshit.
Many scientists have considered that it may not be a quantifiable variable but a universal constant, since regardless of the state, it's all still bullshit.
Further to this, after drawing a curve with a red marker on a whiteboard, some beard scratching and then erasing the curve scientists have concluded that  in sometime during his lifetime CSW will probably make the following claims:
1. He cracked the Voynich Manuscript.
2. He invented the Antikythera Mechanism.
3. He knows and has coffee with Lord Lucan.
4. He can fold a 1m square sheet of paper more than 12 times.
Less likely, but also possible:

The gambling regulators are the enemy here. Its a lot harder to set up a lottery than you think.
In some countries there are ways around it if you can solve the funding issue.
For example, have you ever noticed that the types of questions you need to answer on a radio phone in competition are insanely easy?
Thats not just because they want to get as many daft people as possible to phone in, its also because the triva question changes the game from a pure gamble to a "skill" based game thereby swerving gambling regulation.
The reason its necessary is because when you phone in, you're paying for that call. Without an element of "skill" its a pure gamble. You're gambling the cost of the call on a chance to win.
Even though answering a question correctly and being picked out of a hat at random seems like the same sort of situation as buying a lottery ticket (theres still an element of chance involved), gambling regulators don't...it's a razor thin loophole...but it's widely used.
The easiest way to avoid regulation is to remove payment on entry entirely. If your customers don't have to pay to enter, theres nothing to regulate.
This is where funding your prize pot becomes tricky. You need a way to provide a prize and monetise the people entering the competition without those people actually paying.
Tricky stuff.

Yeah but whats your angle? Seems like you're treading old ground? Theres a bazillion podcasts/youtubers etc already covered this in great depth.
Do you have a niche audience that may be ignorant to all the things that have been said over the last 10 years?
Even my crotchety technophobic daft old man and the other flat cap wearing old duffers at his allotment club can tell you the advantages of Bitcoin.
Perhasps you should interview someone like that to get their perspective?
I'm more interested in what the older generations think rather than my peers since they are the ones we have to convince because they are predominantly the captains of industry / holders of the wealth.
My generation (20's to 30's) is already savvy, just very few of us have a pot to piss in. It's very difficult to bring about economic change if you have very little say or power around economic discussions or decisions.
It's also hard to vote with your wallet when your wallet is empty.
Therefore, understanding the concerns and perspective of those that do have the power to invoke legitimate change is important.

It is. But if you use a precompiled binary you can't compare the binary to the original source code. Therefore, you can't know whether the binary you installed was compiled from the same codebase available in the code repo.
Software distribution and trust is a whole different rabbit hole.
Even if you compiled the software, can you trust the compiler you used? The tool chain?
The idea is to have control over as many aspects of the software stack as possible. Thereby removing as much trust as is humanly possible.
By using a binary, you're adding layers of trust. There are ways to help identify issues along the way though.
Did the binary come from a reputable server?
Check the route to the server and do due diligence on the server IP, hostname and servers in between.
Did it get modifed in transit?
Compare the signature hash of the downloaded file vs the signature hash presented along with the download (if its presented at all).
Did they compile from the repo?
Compile the code yourself and compare the binaries (sig hash, blob size, hex compare) to see if they match.
Did they use an unmodified compiler?
If above test shows differences, check the differences. Do they look patched in after compilation time? Do they look malicious? Try different compilers until results match and find out if that compiler is known to be compromised.
If you can't find the same compiler, something is amiss.
Did they use untampered with libraries?
Same as above, but rotate libs instead of compiler.
Its a lot of work, and I've only scratched tje surface, but if you want a totally trustless crypto setup where every aspect is known to you, this is necessary.

Unfortunately, storage costs are pretty uniform across the board.

Then you would probably do an onchain payment, no? Since the fee, proportionally, will already be very low.
LN isnt for replacing every payment, just smaller ones...at least for now.
I'm sure it will come though.
In order to do what you suggest, you'd need to somehow create multiple invoices and link them.
I.e. it wouldn't be a feature built into LN itself, it would be down to the person accepting LN payments to add the functionality to their payment system.
As far as you would be concerned, you'd just see multiple payment requests in your LN wallet.

So its the same as buying a house then. Which he said is an investment.
The only difference being a developer can plonk a load of "affordable" houses right next to your old shit tip and push the value of your house down.
I'd say the housing market is more of a gamble than Bitcoin since a house experiences wear and tear, the area in which it sits can be subject to creeping flood plains, spiking crime rates, a drop in interest in the area, banks slowing down lending, crap broadband in the area, a downturn in local investment, pikies moving in on the local recreation ground, McDonalds opening a drive thru on your street, unexpected shit academic performance in your local school ... i could go on.
There are so many factors out of your control on property investment that for most people it is actually a gamble.
Sure, if you're buying prime property in an upmarket London postcode its less of a gamble, but not many people can afford that.
Warren Buffet is an out of touch old bastard that only understands his small slice of the world.
If I had £100k, I'd drop it on Bitcoin in a heartbeat, because I could drop it on Bitcoin in a heartbeat.
I wouldn't have to go to endless house viewings, negotiate with twats that have optimistically overvalued their property, deal with a mortgage company with dumb requirements, get locked in for 25 years while having the banks erode the equity with creeping interest rates and so on.
Mr Buffet totally misses the point everytime.
Bitcoin is a sound investment because you can get out as fast as you got in, theres no third party charging you for the privilege of holding the asset, there isnt a small army of dubiously skilled accountants, lawyers, estate agents, banks and surveyors between you and your investment...its just you and your cash.
You also dont have to worry about whether your Bitcoin is in the right postcode, near the right schools, far enough away from electric pylons/substations and all the other crap I listed above.
You can get in and if you crap your pants you can get out.
*ALL* investments are gambles. Some are just a lot less risky and complicated than others.
People like Warren Buffet hate Bitcoin for one simple reason...anyone can buy it and hold it. Not just wealthy elites with armies of people on retainers, literally everyone. There is zero barrier to entry or financial hurdles to jump. Unlike the stock exchange, forex exchanges and so on.
He may be fabulously wealthy and subjectively a good investor, but fuck Warren Buffett.
If I had his money and power, I'd never have to worry about my investments being safe because I'd only have to worry about two things. One, will it return a good profit if it works. Two, can I nail down and sue the fucking balls off someone if it doesnt work to get my money back.
If both boxes can be ticked, good investment!

What exactly is it about Bitcoin that you want to discuss?
The reason you haven't figured out who to interview is probably because you haven't figured out what you want to talk about.
Bitcoin in itself isn't a tight niche subject. I'd also get more than one person one...otherwise you'll have too much of a bias. This is why twats like Roger Ver always seem to be interviewed by themselves all the time. No need for him fight, all he has to do is repeat his own garbage propaganda.
For example, if you wanted to discuss the adoption aspect of Bitcoin, it's no good speaking to a developer, because they can't answer your question. You'd need to find someone already accepted Bitcoin and someone that wants to but can't and get both sides of the story.
Lets say you want to talk about the economic aspect of Bitcoin, you'd need an economist ornsomeone famiar with economic policy and impact. Preferably two, to get both sides.

You don't understand money then.
Even billionaires have mortgages. They leverage their capital to take out whopping big loans.
Why burn your own capital to buy an asset when you can borrow cheap money?
Think about it, if you take out a 10 year loan to buy an asset and it accrues a decent amount of equity within 5 years and you decide to capitalise on that equitable increase, you've made the same money you would have made if you'd paid outright for half the risk and cost.
Using the proceeds from a few of these and you got yourself a damn fine asset for next to nothing...just a piddling amount of interest.
Also, borrowing becomes cheaper the more money you have.
Want a short term payday loan to stop you starving to death? That'll be 600% APR please...want a million bucks on a mortgage for a nice house? that'll be 3% APR please.

It's a solid idea, but doesn't offer peace of mind. You probably know as well as I do that SD cards fail in Raspberry Pi devices...a lot.
If I were to launch a product like this (which I have considered), I'd be putting the value in where it counts. Replacement SD cards for free for a limited time (up to 3 years), solid support (assistance with backing up / recovering wallets and so on).
Without those value added services you're going to get kicked in the balls every time someone has their wallet die because the SD card failed and they lose their coins.
You can have disclaimers up the ass covering you against other people's losses, but those don't offer customers "warm fuzzy feelings" when they go to bed at night.
A device like this should be an extension of a service, not the core product.
The difficulty isn't in the tech itself, it's in having the man power to deliver a service behind it.
Ask China, they clone shit all the time, because it's cheap when you don't have to do the R&amp;D.
That's why you don't publically offer your Pi images for download (at least that I've found), it's an easy product to clone.
You know what's difficult to clone? A solid service...because that costs serious money.
I've tried to get something off the ground before but investors right now generally don't understand this space so securing funding is fucking hard. I think for now, a full blown wallet hardware/software support service is a bit ahead of its time.
It's especially tricky because you have to be transparent about every package / piece of software used in your product. We live in an age where products being backdoored / compromised is a very real problem...people are also becoming a lot more security conscious...over time that is only going to increase and improve, the demand for transparency will intensify.

I see your logic. However, before he came to be in front of Goku there were tons of filler episodes of Vegeta in a pod heading to earth.
Later in the series, most of his time spent in pods travelling across space was spent training.
Combine the two and you have Vegeta training in space while waiting a long time for a fight. Perfect meme really.

Well...yeah but there's a lot of (and I mean a lot of) engineers out there that will keep comms running.
Only systems like DNS and such are significantly centralised.
In a post apocalyptic situation there will still be global(ish) comms....it'll be slow as fuck and your average person will find it harder to use, but it'll be there. Memes will be at a premium and shit posting will have to be rationed.
Protocols like TCP/IP are open standards, nobody can prevent anyone implementing it.
What's a government going to do if a group of skilled engineers wants to keep things running? Send them a court summons?
I think Governments will be a bit preoccupied with all the looters and violence.
Large corporations will be preoccupied with stealing and hiding all their physical assets.
Nerds breaking in and taking over infrastructure won't be a priority to them.
Poor people will be looting from retailers and neighbours, rich people will be stealing from themselves and engineers will be kicking doors in at phone exchanges, civil utilities and power stations.
If you want to get through an apocalyptic event in a civilised manner (warmth, light, shelter, plumbing, memes and shit posting to Reddit etc)...follow the techies.
Civil engineering buildings are built like fortresses and have nothing worth looting in them. They also tend to be out of the way...therefore a lot safer than say...your local Tesco / Police Station / Hospital etc. They are also industrial buildings and therefore lots of first aid equipment.
If you intend to stock up on expensive stuff you can't use, a lifetime supply of paracetamol / lemsip and get into a few fights, pick up your hammer and crowbar and go looting at your local shopping mall. That's where the action will be.

I was drunk, because it was Friday. He said "man, I got a bargain for you right here. A quantum sleep."
Now I'm a sucker for science so I thought, "there's no way this scruffy looking dude has quantum tech for £5...but I decided what the fuck, I'll take it.
He handed me a balloon with a sleeping pill and a mushroom inside and told me to eat them.
I complied but not before he stopped me in my tracks.
"Take them out of the balloon, you fucking idiot" he said.
So I did. Swallowed them and now here I am. As for the pill and mushroom, clearly they did nothing.

Well in a normal setup we have buy and sell (or do nothing) as our standard set of trading functions.
If they've gone quantum, then we can buy, sell, do nothing any combination of the three or some sort of position between any of them.
Let's say buying and selling doesn't cut your current stance, if you could use super positions you could slightly sell but mostly buy in a single move.
Bottom line: I was shit posting and sending up the notion that a trading platform can be "advanced". Fundamentally, all you can do on any trading platform is buy, sell or do nothing. Being advanced would suggest you can do more than buy, sell or nothing.
Sure, there's leverage and lending and other fun stuff. But at its core, trading is buying, selling and holding.

Yup. Post Vegeta and it adds $100 to Bitcoin. Check the charts and the time of this post.
If everyone posts Vegeta memes we'll hit his magic number in no time.

That's a Bitcoin SV hodler with a sore arse.

Can we expect super position of BUY and SELL? Or is just BUY and SELL like other exchanges?

There are some indicators that work well if you need to understand what has happened or what might be happening now, but none that can tell you where it's going.
Check out Welles Wilder. His indicators can be very useful.

No need. Vegeta teaches patience and stoicism. If you can't HODL your balls are inert.
@_date: 2019-05-28 10:40:25
That's not true. I travel forward in time all the time without a machine. It's just really slow.

Yes, YES. LET THE MEMES FLOW THROUGH!

Yes because tickets to Consensus are insanely expensive.
It's bonkers that they even charge at all.
@_date: 2019-05-17 08:02:13
No reason they can't co-exist with atomic swaps.

Are you...Jackie Chan?

Nah nonesense. Its easier to set up and interact with an LN node than it is to build an entire eCommerce platform.
I think his problem might actually be lack of skill out there willing to build and integrate a setup for him.
There is large demand out there (if my DM's are anything to go by), but because there are so few of us willing to assist with LN implementation right now the day rates for the work are probably insanely high...mine arent in case anyone is wondering, but I know that a few people round here are charging megabux!
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:36:05

Get your Vegeta memes ready.

You laugh but I'm serious. I get messages from time travellers all the time.
This one guy came and told me that Rome is going to fall thousands of years before now. He wasn't wrong.
Then this other time I thought I had a chance to re-live a day and do it again differently.
It all started at a train station in Surrey. I walked through the ticket barrier and picked up a copy of the Metro. It was dated Friday, which was weird because I was convinced it was Saturday.
There was only one explanation. I'd gone back in time. I ran home immediately to speak to my past self to tell him that Bitcoin was about to moon, but weirdly I wasn't where I remembered I was the previous day. So I spent a few hours retracing steps.
I must have been narrowly missing myself because I was nowhere to be found.
Suddenly, my wife woke up and opened the bedroom door and began walking out. As a precaution I hid in a nearby cupboard. I didn't want her to go into shock at seeing the future version of myself. That's be weird I thought.
I waited.
She left the house with the kids and I got out of the cupboard and continued my search.
Then I got a phone call, it was my wife from the future asking if I'd arrived at the airport to pick my mother in law up.
I tried to explain that I was trapped in the past and that this phone call must be happening via some sort of quantum entanglement. I told her not to worry as I didn't need to be there for another 24 hours.
I've been trapped 24 hours in the past ever since. Ducking, diving, hiding. Looking for my future self.

Depends on how you envisage the movement being detected.
Are you looking to use a technical indicator or just "notify at x% change"?
@_date: 2019-05-01 13:01:35
It's not the money that changed him.
If I looked like Kevin Spacey, I'd probably change my appearance too.

I too remember that day.

Either way, given that this is a cyclical process that's good news.

"Bitcoin uses enough energy to power the life support machines of a thousand baby orphans"
Yes, yes but where do members of the general public buy these life support machines for all these orphans?
It's not like Bitcoin miners chose between saving a baby and mining Bitcoin.
Even if all the miners did chose to run incubators instead of miners they'd still get shit for practicing medicine without a license.
Where do these fuckwits come from?

Interesting. I put "time cop" in a Google image search and seems the most prominent one is Jean Claude Van Damme. He must be the chief. Makes sense because he doesn't seem to be in any movies these days, maybe he changed career?

Omg this meme. It's like the meme gods are sending a sign.
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:29:39
That's not true. We will still need brainless fuckwits to peel the plastic off the kiosks.
Think about it, if we try and automate that job it's an infinite pit of wasted resources.
We'd need robots to peel plastic, and a kiosk to manage those robots, which needs the plastic peeled off. Which needs to be done by robots controlled via a kiosk...and so on.
We need to either solve the plastic peeling problem or keep the working class around a bit longer.
