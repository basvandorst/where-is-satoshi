Not more than I was prepared to lose ;)

I think it's probably still worth it, what's the worst that can happen? Even if it just puts you to the top of some kind of queue.

You should insult people less, and probably read more.

Ah, well then I guess we're the second. They should advertise that fact though!

Thanks dude!

Yeah, exactly, if it doesn't come back then it's no big deal really but if it does, I'll feel like I've won some money.

Thanks for the good luck! The bank did say to go to the police but as oskArtists says below, it's fraud and not theft. Either way, I don't see the point in going to the police, it'll just slow the whole process down.

and we appreciate your sentiment! As we say, we know it's probably not the right demographic but we believe in bitcoin!

I expect it to be frozen for a long time, the bank suggested I file a fraud complaint with the police but I declined knowing that it would just prolong the process...I can't imagine that everyone feels the same though, I'm sure at least one person would have been to the police.

Oh no! The last thing we wanted to do was make you feel cake deprived! Don't worry, I'll eat a piece for you. 
Just so you know, we're opening up a shop soon too so this is kind of like a little bitcoin taster session before we launch ;)
