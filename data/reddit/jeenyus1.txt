Dang! Pretty advanced fishing technique :S
Curious, did you buy these Bitcoins or mined?

This is why I think in the near-future something will be done, the tipping point is soon and if we don't see some sort of regulations or hostile take-overs, I'd be very surprised and quite frankly thrilled because I do think BTC is about more than just monetary gain for investors and miners, I think with  decentralized currency, hundreds of years from now the world can be a safer place in the long-run.

Buying politicians can be a greater risk/reward scenario as opposed to spending a tiny, tiny, minuscule amount of capital into hardware/infrastructure. To put it into perspective IMF has 90.5 million troy ounces of gold alone (valued at $11,348,700,000 = eleven billion, three hundred forty-eight million, seven hundred  thousand dollars
@ current price of $1254/ounce)... Spending the amount of money necessary to quash Bitcoin for the IMF or even large banking institutions is a drop into a large, large bucket.
Theoretically, they wouldn't even need to invest in hardware itself, they would just have to hold a majority of Bitcoin purchased through exchanges. Thus being able to fluctuate the value of such cryptocurrencies through manipulation just like fiat.

You hit my question spot on. So Once I create a brand new Paper Wallet and have it printed, I would physically still need to transfer my Mining BTC funds to the Paper Wallet's ADDRESS. Then the physical Paper Wallet I've created weeks prior, will always reflect the current amount of BTC I have as long I constantly transfer funds to this Paper Wallet, correcto-mondo?

keyword :controlled.
If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their  currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks…will deprive the people of  all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered…. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs. – Thomas Jefferson in the debate over the Re-charter of the Bank Bill (1809)

I am now a shareholder of Overstock.
If you believe in Bitcoin and are an investor invest in Overstock. 2 birds with 1 stone.
