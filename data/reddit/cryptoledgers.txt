Firstly, welcome and thanks for taking this leap of faith. I follow a simple analogy with regards to storage. Once you own Bitcoin, you are your own Bank and hence you need to acquire banking grade security to protect it. I suggest never to store Bitcoin on any online exchange or wallet. Instead buy Trezor or Nano S and store your Bitcoin's private key on these devices and when you want to make a transaction, sign it using these devices. Have a read and you will become a fan of cold storage of Bitcoin.

Agree completely. Bobby is a great speaker but somehow I find him not appreciating the intellect of his audience at times or may be he doesn't do the preparation or is ill informed by the event organisers. He gave a very odd speech about Chinese capital flight during Blockchain week 2017 in London recently explaining the process using one of the most slow-witted presentation of thoughts I have witnessed in recent times. Overall, I do find him just the right kind of personality one would need to take bitcoin to the masses.

Well said. In fact, if anyone is in cryptographic and blockchain world and is not aware of Balaji Srinivasan of 21, you are missing out following one of the brightest contributor to this technology till date.

In the trading world, it is better to be silent and watch things from the sidelines if you are just a speculator. You telling people not to sell their houses won't make them stop selling their houses. These types of free advice means nothing unless backed by concrete proofs regarding the fundementals supported by technical analysis.

How about [BITKAPITAL](

It's an asset if you want to view it as such. It's currency if you want to trade with it. Bitcoin is like gold that's faster to move and easier to carry. All we need now is businesses to start accepting more and more of Bitcoin along with Fiat.

I bought 10 back in April 2016 exactly at $350 for my wife who wanted to take a leap of faith and is now a hodler!

Good to know you own 1000 Bitcoins!
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:26:40
It's okay. You can always sell your car and buy Litecoin and hope you will recover it all in 1 year!

Coinbase is great. But I do feel kraken and Gemini have more resilient infrastructure. The demand for BTC is at all time high and with arbitrage opportunities to make almost $400 a day trading different markets have put an insurmountable amount of pressure on these exchanges.

One of the easiest way to enable such a mass adoption would be to enable whatsapp users to be able to send each other Bitcoin through the messaging interface. Be able to buy, sell from the same.

Good luck! If you do manage to recover ETH, don't sell!

Why didn't you buy 8 Cassacius Bitcoin then if you liked pretty things? At least you would still have $24 million sitting right next to you and yet be as pretty as the kitchen knife.
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:34:08
I bet. That were just 2000 bitcoins with current valuation of $5 million.

That's one of the wittiest comment I have heard here in a long time!
