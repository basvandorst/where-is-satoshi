This was recorded December 10, 2013 at the Inside Bitcoins conference in Las Vegas. I've prepared a video that syncs the talk with the slides from the talk, and you can also get audio-only version or download the PDF of the slides from my website, at 
Alan Reiner, CEO of Armory Technologies, will give a layman's introduction to how Bitcoin works, and then discuss best practices that every Bitcoin user should know to safely use and manage bitcoins. He will describe why Bitcoin is different than other payment systems, how the network reaches agreement on transactions, how to backup your wallets, and how to use addresses to maximize privacy. The concept behind ʺCold Storageʺ will also be explained with information for new users to get started using it. The presentation will also touch on developing technologies in the Bitcoin community, including hardware wallets and multi-device authentication.

I get it on everything I post. I just posted a two hour video of Andreas speaking to the LA Bitcoin meetup group and it just gets downvoted. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:22:08
You ask me why I'm involved in this conversation if I'm not familiar with the nuances if the mining industry. 
I never said I wasn't. And I've said several times why I posted what I posted. But I'm sure you'll have a witty, skewed retort for that.
You can't carry a logical line of discussion and have repeatedly misrepresented what I've said. Good day.

Perhaps you should consider I'm not playing out anything. I saw people in the community getting upset. I reached out to someone if talked to there before and asked what was going on. I was told what I was told, and relayed it to the community. I don't know anything more than anyone else. 
I don't know why no one seems to be able to take what I say as just that. I've also repeatedly said that they need to communicate better. They are currently sucking in that department. The repeated changing of terms is also something that should be answered for. I've never ordered or considered ordering anything from them, so that's not an aspect I've followed or pretended to follow.
I've never heard of test net? That's why I mentioned he live network. Jesus Christ. If hey manufacture equipment, they're allowed to keep a few boxes and mine with them on the live network if they want. This is hardly the big issue. If it's not customer equipment then it isn't customer equipment. If people got these boxes and they didn't work on he live network FOR WHATEVER REASON then everyone would crucify them as well. You're ignorant to think companies are never testing their equipment internally on the live network. 
I'm passing on information. I'm telling people what they said. Yes. People lie. That's not my problem. I'm telling you what I know and what I think.  I never claimed any of it was fact or proven. I don't own any equipment by them. I've never been paid anything or given anything by them. I don't know if what they say is true or not. I'm relaying my opinion; which is just as valid as anyone's. I'm sorry if my lack of investment and ability to look at the situation objectively upsets anyone. It is what it is. I was providing the information I have. Period.

I don't know what you expect us to do. This is a problem the community is highly aware of. The difficulty self-adjusts every two weeks to help, and it's a rare occurrence. For this to be a real danger, it has to happen in a predictable way, and right now, while it does happen here and there, it isn't regularly occurring. And furthermore, there's no way to predict it happening to leverage it financially. 
"I guess no one really cares" isn't quite accurate. But most of us are just users like you. What do you want us to do? Picket?

Is be really interested in companies strategies. I wish more would share what they do. I don't think Gyft converts all their BTC holdings. 
Either way, all I'm saying is the payment processor isn't an indicator. Someone could just as easily implement a custom cart solution and still be cashing then out daily.

It's not arrogance. I'm annoyed at having words put in my mouth and being taken out of context. I'm not getting between anyone. I'm standing up for what I said and setting the record straight for people who can't seem to understand what I said and what I didn't say. I don't have a dog in this fight. I was merely telling my experience. 
I'm sorry if you didn't get your miner or whatever. None of that is my problem. I didn't come in here with a hostile tone. I came in and made a statement I thought might shed some light on the subject since others had been unable to contact the company. 
People view opposing views or information as hostile. Granted, I'm not in here sweet talking anyone, but I'm also not going to so there and be taken out of context or misquoted without setting shit straight.  
Either way, good luck with your miners.

As far as I know it does. They are supposed to release a lite version soon that won't have to download the full blockchain. But as of now they are lagging a bit. The Mac version is in desperate need of a refresh. But I saw the latest version running on Ubuntu and it was pretty slick. The features are great.

Just because someone uses Coinbase or BitPay doesn't meant they're converting to fiat instantly or ever, nor does it mean they are converting ALL of their BTC to fiat. I think it's misleading to use the word "directly"; they both accept Bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2014-01-01 02:15:36
Hi. This is Patrick from the Coinsider This! podcast. I reached out to HashFast over the weekend and have had an ongoing dialogue with a few of the employees over the past fee months. 
They have issues a statement to me that they are, without a doubt, not mining with any customer equipment other than to do a burn in test. They do have a small handful of machines ( I'm told 5 or less) mining on the live network. Those machines will never be sent to customers and are in use for testing and development. 
My initial instinct is I believe them as I've talked to several people there and they seem really honest and genuine. 
The lack of communication is the main issue. I have talked to them about how important communication with customers is and was told in so many words that they are pretty much too busy to keep up their blog or communicate regularly. 
That should be more of a priority.

What is that based on? I'm just wondering if you're speculating or they've made a statement? I would think any company that has invested in accepting Bitcoin as a payment probably has a holding strategy of some sort. The fact is, business has to go on, so converting some to fiat to handle expenses may be necessary.
Regardless, they're accepting Bitcoin and seeing sales made in Bitcoin, and that isn't bad for the ecosystem no matter what. I guarantee both companies convert BTC to fiat as needed. But for us to guess what that means is just that - a guess.

We've been on the front page of the main podcasting page in iTunes, as well as the front page of Society and Culture and Philosophy sections, and now they've tweeted us to 220K+ people.

That doesn't even make sense. Vouch for someone you don't know means a) you don't know how vouching works OR b)your vouching for someone is meaningless. No offense. But that sentence is meaningless. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:13:43
No worries I just want it to be seen, not only because it's my show but because this kind of stuff is super interesting and important, yet not readily accessible to most people sitting at home who can't come to these events. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:58:48
I live in LA. This would be huge I think.
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:40:11
But the graphic is old. There's much better tools now to educate people about how a bitcoin transaction works. 
And regardless, just because you want someone to see something that was posted a long time ago isn't an excuse to repost it. That's not how reddit works. If this were the case, every subreddit would just be a constant regurgitation of the same items. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 03:25:22
I don't recommend doing anything. I just know some people will. I also don't recommend anything on a virtual machine, as something like cryptolocker or a similar piece of malware could compromise anything on your physical or network disks. I have no idea what this software does! Just be careful!

"Our internet connection is secure"
There's no such thing. If you're connected to the full open internet, it's impossible to guarantee you're secure. Do you mean that your wifi network has a password? Because that's a very small piece.

Who designs the billboards? Can we see them anywhere? There are several up in Los Angeles right now, but no one seems to know who put them up. At least 7-8 of them in east LA. And they are designed pretty poorly and the message is ambiguous and non-impressive at best. 
I wish the community worked together on these things before they were deployed to deliver a clear, well-designed message that will be educational AND impactful. There's a lot of science behind billboard marketing.

@_date: 2013-12-02 19:43:40
These posts are starting to feel like spam. Everyone appreciates that these businesses are accepting Bitcoin, but this doesn't scale. We have directories for businesses that take Bitcoin. It's great that your son makes bracelets or your wife makes puzzles, and I'm glad you made four sales in one day for the first time ever, but these are starting to get annoying. Not personal, just my two cents. I view these threads that are doing nothing but shilling as spam.
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:26:57
I understand. Insane though. And with a company like Google, they do a lot of localization and emails come in local languages. But yes, if a non-English speaker got this I can see how they might not be familiar with the nuances of the English language. 
I guess the rule is be suspicious. I won't even download the dogecoin client to play with it because I'm too suspicious.

So, in a way, if you think these are real you are "more stupid" or at the very last "not perceptive". Correct?

No worries. Thanks for watching!

This is great. I am running a bitcoin shirt design contest on my podcast, Coinsider This!, and thought you might be interested in throwing a design in the ring.

Some guy from butterfly was giving a talk on mining and when the q&amp;a portion happened, someone asked "how do you guys defend your business practices?" Or something like that. The session was promptly ended with no answer to the question. It was awkward. I may or may not have a recording on my podcast soon.

There was a reporter from USA Today at the Inside Bitcoins conference and she did spend pretty much the entire day there, diligently taking notes and writing. Hopefully the press is starting to really learn about and take Bitcoin seriously.

Haha yes. I need to go back on again sometime. Thanks and check out nobodylikesonions.com. It's my other podcast.

To say you have no legal recourse after sending your bitcoins is also not correct. We are watching a lawsuit right now where a man is in trouble for stealing peoples bitcoins. Theft is theft. If it's illegal, you always have legal option to go after the seller, especially a company. Just because it's not built in to the protocol doesn't mean there are no rules for commerce where you live, and stealing is now legal.

Pointing it another problem with reports here doesn't make you doing it ok.

Hey guys. I'm the host of the Coinsider This! Bitcoin podcast and am local in Los Angeles. I will head over tomorrow, get some pics and videos and try to talk to the owner if he's there. I'll post back here tomorrow and let you know all the details. This is great!

I'll remove it soon. I want to let some security-minded people grab it up to play with and dissect.

Furthermore, even if you don't get notices of transactions, there is nothing you need to do to receive an amount of bitcoin from someone. You don't have to approve a transaction (reddit bitcoin tips aside), confirm anything, install anything, etc. if someone sends bitcoin to an address, it's there. Period.

I will be uploading a few more talks from the conference over the next few weeks and also traveling to more next year. So subscribe, either on iTunes or YouTube!
I submitted this myself but it got zero traction. Hopefully this one climbs a bit. I think this is an interesting talk that a lot of people would like to hear!

Who the hell is down voting this? I'm bringing you the full talk of a very important sector of the bitcoin economy by some very influential people. There's absolutely no reason to down vote this post.

WALLET SOFTWARE! Bitcoin needs solutions to make it easier to understand and use. Right now wallet software development is slow and limited. More people making wallets will drive competition and innovation. You don't necessarily have to work with the bitcoin development team to help develop bitcoin. That's the beauty of it!

I can vouch for the quality of these things. Heavy, thick, and about twice the diameter of a Casascius coin. The standard Casascius coins feel really light after holding this hefty coin. It's also really beautiful and fun to use as a Bitcoin conversation starter! (I'm going to be talking about it on my Bitcoin podcast at  - there's my shameless plug!)

I tend to consider tech support more customer service than IT. I wouldn't look for over 40K for this position. But I have no idea. Just offering some point of reference. My background is from IT in Florida, though.

I'm lucky to not have had any of these issues. I've even bought a Gyft card using safari on iOS and then used it in the app within a minute, pretty flawlessly. 
The one big I've noticed is the same Gyft card showing up in the app more than once with no way to get rid of it. Deleting the app and reinstalling fixed this temporarily. But it always comes back and is duplicated. So I have he same cards twice. Odd.

Hi. I'm the host of the show and the guy who posted this. As you said, yes, from what china has said at this time, it's not only illegal for a Chinese company to accept Bitcoin for goods or services, but they can't even price things in Bitcoin. This is way more restrictive than the US is right now. However everyone still seems very optimistic that regulations will be clarified and relaxed at some point in the future.

Sure, if you have no idea how Bitcoin works. Sure.

It blows me away every time I see one of these that they seem to never be proofread at all. Not even a cursory once- over. Why would the word hacker or thieves be capitalized for no reason? Does this feel like anything google has ever published? EVER?

IT is vague. I think you're wishing on a dream in this economy if you think someone working tech support (with the qualifications above) is going to make 60K in Texas. I wouldn't be surprised if it's between 30K and 40K with bonuses.

I have called and spoken to people there twice today. They don't have any idea what Bitcoin is, nor do they accept it. They also don't have anyone named Raaj who works there. This seems to be a hoax or prank. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 03:07:35
This isn't true. The iOS app sends without asking anything. And sometimes it sends fees that are insane. One time I was charged a .007 BTC fee when the value of bitcoin was over $1100. That's over $7 for a transaction fee. Blockchain.info refunded me, but how many people don't catch stuff like this? Looking forward to an app update!

I'm the host of the Coinsider This! podcast (the guy who uploaded the BTC China talk from Las Vegas with Bobby Lee).
I posted that very talk on r/Bitcoinmarkets and was quickly voted to the top of that subreddit. Hours later, a mod there questioned it's relevance to the subreddit and gave me a warning. I snapped back that it was a discussion about Bitcoin in the largest market for Bitcoin by a guy who runs the largest exchange. Their mods fought with me and I couldn't believe it. I am now banned from posting in that subreddit due to arguing with mods about free content I was trying to provide the community.
I've also since posted the final panel from Inside Bitcoins Las Vegas last week in this subreddit, and it got no traction at all. It's a fantastic talk with Andreas M. Antonopoulos and many others. If you haven't seen it, check it out. 
TL;DR; - I have no idea what logic dictates the things that get voted up or down here. It seems random to me.

I just think the space hasn't had much innovation or competition. Lots of room for new products. And the current wallets don't get updated frequently.

I would honestly love to know the logic behind down-voting this content. How could me providing this be construed as negative to anyone in this community. I don't understand Reddit sometimes.
