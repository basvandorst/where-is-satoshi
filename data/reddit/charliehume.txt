Good old Uncle Hodl

Coinbase charges a fee for credit cards.
Cash advance fees are larger. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:16:15
Hey as long as you don't go into crypto debt you're technically hodlin at zero. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:04:43
Oh this is just fucking magic. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:44:57
What else would it be treated as? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:02:06
So what is it you think I'm saying? That a merchant would charge you interest on a cash advance from a third party? That's madness. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:36:01
39 million? Imagine all the crypto you could buy with that kind of money! 
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:00:21
Oh that was either a long time ago or those people are really bad at reading. Coinbase charges a fee to use a credit card and it's no where near the typically 25.99%+ APR for a cash advance. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:19:36
Where in my post did I say coinbase is charging for a cash advance? How would that make any sense? Coinbase charges higher fees for credit cards and I said those are lower than the APR for a cash advance. You do realize this is a thread about purchases with an interest free period of a credit card right? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:15:46
Maybe you shouldn't respond to random posts without reading the whole thread? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:39:27
But it said we had an invoice due! And I don't know the send but I can't let my boss that I let an invoice slip! So they asked for my mother's maiden name? Who doesn't!? Last 4 of my social? I mean it's not even the whole number, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:20:01
a 6 figure salary isn't exactly common anywhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:29:58
There's probably a similar ratio for paper money. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:18:49
Jesus keeping anything above 1 btc on a software wallet is just insane. How pray tell was he hacked anyway?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:27:50
Nah that's a bunch of well thought out in the moment ideas. I was born in the mid-80's and the idea of a credit card being used to pay for groceries was unthinkable when I was a kid. Hell I had a job just 14 years ago at a popular retail/grocery chain that had a detailed policy on check handling because the majority of our customers paid in either check or cash. I switched industries after that and saw that our customers went from 80% cash to 70% credit in just 10 years.  
Old people just adapt to whatever thing works for payment. It's not like they were good at counting money or writing a check. Seriously, have you ever been stuck behind an old person writing  a check for something? That's never fast. I love BTC for being the OG but honestly one of these coins is going to be accepted at check out lanes very soon and within a few years it'll just be the thing we do. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:09:06
For a company that basically shapshifted altcoins for a fee? Yeah I'm going to guess it was a real bad hack by the infamous 4chan and everyone at the company is real sad about it. When I'm sad I usually liquidate my accounts and move to another country.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:33:43
Yeah well the invention of purses led to record highs of purses being stolen.

This post is one of the best fucking things I've ever seen as a argument for hardware wallets. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:17:27
If they actually kept $60 million out of cold storage they are all fucking stupid beyond belief. I own a very small amount and I keep that shit off the internet because jesus christ, it's the fucking internet. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:13:10
Yeah here's the thing, they could have been stealing everything all along and realized with the recent upswing in BTC  that people might want to cashout. Run on the banks who don't have the money to cover debts? Boom. We're uhhh closed cause HACKERS!?! Yeah. Bye. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:14:29
I found some asshole selling Bitcoin "packs" as basically a pyramid scam. Is this a common thing or should I be posting this shit on here? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:15:04
That's like saying the last card in a deck has to be an ace because you've removed 51 other cards. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:55:06
Zero? Who knows. It could be one of the options, or maybe just one coin will win. I'm hoping there's mass adoption of multiple coins, which will probably be the case. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:05:05
Hmm, well that just makes me think "got hacked" means "realized they could just keep all the money they had." 
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:24:53
211k... wow. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:29:01
Aren't there 1 million bits in a coin?
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:09:01
But SDR isn't a currency? I may be wrong here, but isn't it exchangeable for the four major currencies - Euro, Dollar, Yen and Pound? How would it replace the dollar? Isn't it worth the respective weights of each of the funds it represents? Also, to my knowledge there's really not very much of it in circulation currently. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:03:18
Well that's just not accurate. The USD has had periods of negative and positive inflation. Compare the early 1930's to the late 1940's for instance. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:29:58
I'm a fracking toaster?!
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:51:35
All along the watchtower
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:32:06
So you're thinking the dollar is going to collapse? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:25:06
The Yuan got added? I am behind on this, whoops. Off to Google. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:27:49

Fracking toasters! Oh wait...

After the last fork it went up

There is now a year of fairly non volatile data.

What lol a software wallet is like child level easy 
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:43:30

It's not a market it's a currency!

It's like buying the Dinar if the US actually gave a fuck about repairing Iraq. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:22:09
Sweet, no idea why you give a shit how old I am, but thanks for thinking I'm a kid. Buy my shitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:50:54
lol like anybody gives a fuck about rich people and their weird shit? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:01:32
The relative amount to a fiat currency and the amount of time are not the important factors in volatile.

Holy shit, I'm pretty sure any woman of average intelligence can figure out how to get your coins onto fucking coinbase and sell them if you die. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:56:22
I'm sorry I don't hide these things from my spouse and I think it's weird to do so. I was assuming these would be provided. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:53:48
It's easy to say this while not facing oppression. This is the same argument as "stop hitting yourself" if I use your fist to hit you.  
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:08:14
Jesus look at the white knight riding in the defend their honor against my horrible comment! How noble.

You think empathy is training? Jeez, that's interesting. Tell me about your relationship with your mother.

“Don’t let this man distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer’s table.”
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:55:24
Only if you're incapable of empathy and assume people claiming oppression are doing it to harm you. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:58:28
You're one of those intent is all that matter types, aren't you? Just because you don't get why someone is offended doesn't mean they're lying.
