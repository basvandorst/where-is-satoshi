I don't like a technical decision being resorted to PR campaigns. The correctness of a solution is never judged by it's reddit upvotes. If such approach (pushing an opinion about a technical decision thorough PR campaign) succeeds, it will worries me a lot that the robustness of the entire system is vastly dependent on the marketing ability of attackers.
Personally I like the idea that the limit, along with other parameters, being adjusted by some sort of market mechanism or negative feedback loop to discover its optimal equilibrium. But I fully respect and realize the concerns of the core developers who are against the limit change. **The potential risks/costs of lifting the size limit are far more real and severe than that the blocks getting saturated and the transaction fees raising several cents.**
The likely net losers (in the case that block spaces are in shortage) that I can think of are payment processors like Coinbase and/or Bitpay, though I am not sure how much money would cost them. But it's definitely not a good idea to implement a short-sighted workaround solely for helping them profitable 'effortlessly'.
In summary, what I strongly disagree, except particular unsound and/or short-sighted solutions to the problem, is the approach how some of the supporters pushing for it.

About the second point "Centralization Death Spiral", I have a question. Doesn't the blocks have to be broadcasted and accepted by the majority of nodes, and eventually spread over the entire network? If every node can set their own acceptable upper-limit of block-size, isn't a 'smaller' miner able to refuse to relay the blocks that they don't like because it's too expensive to process? It looks like even the miners with advantageous bandwidth power can't arbitrarily abuse those weaker ones, but I'm not sure.

Not exactly. The banks *borrow* money by CDs. founds, insurances, and *invest*(speculate) the raised capital into financial markets. Notice that the *leverage ratio* a bank typically holds, you'll understand whether a bank is actually a borrower or a lender. Again, a bank profits from leverage, ever. That's why when financial markets and banks get into trouble, there will be something happening called 'deleveraging', and government and banks just get panic.

I hope so. But the accumulated spam data would still be there


SMTP is not an optimal, or is even a subordinate, file transfer protocol regardless it's 10KB or 10GB limited. Therefore the rationale for raising the limits to compete with other file transfer protocols is strategically flawed. However bitcoin, as an infrastructure layer protocol and a "SDK", it does provide the required essences (some are to be amended) for building various higher-level innovative applications, including payment network with extra demanded features. 
What one would ask in the first place with regard to the block size issue is the *minimum* required size capable of extending to its full potential. If 128KB is enough to support full-fledged lightning network and sidechain for example, then 128KB is better than 1MB. If 8KB is enough, then 8KB is better than 128KB. Imagining that the maximum block size and required network bandwidth is so low that you could have the node being running like a normal "nice" background program without the need of a dedicated network connection, people, regardless of their opinions, would have much more full nodes for their favorite implementations on board already.
Edit: Fix grammar and typos

3. If Lightning Network were ready now, would it help solve the problem? If no, what characteristics do you demand for as a feasible solution?

Currency and the settlement layer are orthogonal concepts. They are not mutually exclusive. Which means, you can have USD over various settlement institutions, and meanwhile you can have a settlement mechanism capable of dealing with many currencies. It's confusing to say something like "I want USD to be a currency/I hate USD to be a settlement layer".
Edit: In short, one million US dollars worth deposit of a checking account is not less (or more) "currency"-ish than the same amount of money stored at somewhere else.

Like Gavin Anderson said, payment processors, exchanges and other types of services can make clearing agreements, get federated together or establish an EMV-like organization on top of Bitcoin. But I don't regard it as a negative thing. It could be likely to be a natural evolution in the future no matter you like it or not, big or small block. This is also not something that can be prevented *mathematically* by the Bitcoin protocol.
Imagine that VISA enables Bitcoin payment someday and being capable of thousands of txs per second immediately. The transaction fees could be significantly low, even lower than our *traditional* Bitcoin services, and suddenly making block size a non-issue.

The whole debate has already successfully distracted the resources and focus of the core developers (and those of Blockstream who are the primary engineering forces of side-chains, who are coincidentally the centre of hatred being directed to) and has given more 'breathing room' for those coins to prevent bitcoin from uniting a wide scope of applications in cryptocurrency space, which would result in the loss of opportunities of boostrapping yet another pre-mined coins.

The scalability (in this case, we are talking about node numbers) is *inversely* proportional to the cost of a single node. The "my four year old machine" argument can NOT deny the equation. And this small constant of the equation influences how the whole system will evolve. We either get more and more nodes to strengthen the decentralization, or we have less and less nodes and miners.

@_date: 2016-01-23 01:12:50
This is not a good approach in my opinion. Raising block size is an unrecoverable change. In all regards, anything supposed to be transferred on networks should be as small as possible and no smaller. We don't scale IMAP/SMTP (the protocols for emails) to do what FTP, BitTorrent or Samba is good at even if it can be used to transfer files with the attachments. Also we don't scale Ethernet frames to be large enough to fit the demand of a BD. We build layers on top of it like IP for routing and TCP for reliability. Heading over to the scalability goal along only one dimension and expect it to fulfill the unlimited needs is an anti-pattern in engineering. It's not a good idea to solve a exponential problem with a linear-capable algorithm. In addition, it's invaluable to make the reduction of cost of running bitcoin nodes, so that they can be deployed pervasively as the technology progressing, given that the max block size stays constant. It's unfortunate to see the "[every progress is canceled]( quote happen in bitcoin due to a poor decision. There are certainly other incentives other than the block rewards that would justify running a node, which is very helpful to approach more decentralization — the core selling-point of bitcoin.

Can you clarify what you mean by "small transactions"? Does it mean transactions with small monetary value or transactions with shorter length in bytes?
If you mean smaller-bytes-sized transactions, then I don't see why or how the satellites would filter out small transactions but allowing big ones.
If you mean smaller-monetary-value transactions, I don't know how it would related to the bandwidth of the satellites either.  As far as I know, higher amount of bitcoin doesn't result in fatter packets.

I do think, for the sake of efficiency, the block size is a smaller-is-better number like the size of battery package or area of IC chips. Say, if there were an altcoin which consumes an order of magnitude smaller bandwidth and storage size (Note that the two parameters do not contribute proportionally to the security of the network like computing power) but provides the same features as Bitcoin, it would likely be a Bitcoin killer immediately.  
Given that the block size increase is a by-product introduced by segwit, I do not hold a strong opinion about it.

Bitcoin, as its raw form, is more suitable to be the backbone infrastructure which is transparent to average end users. Now companies like Circle can serve as *hubs* for packing transactions in batch or use Bitcoin literally as clearing network, which would be very advantageous and economical than, say, as a cheaper PayPal or VISA alternative. I think this is a case of entrepreneurs' innovations driven by the price signal (of the fee market), despite they are complaining hard. Meanwhile, the distributed nature of Bitcoin will not be compromised. These 'hubs', being well decoupled from the backbone infrastructure, still don't control the network from any aspect.

As I said before, what the larger block folks care about is the *Time To Market* issue.
IMHO, if bitcoin ends up with just targeting to be a cheaper credit card alternative, without even the consumer protection feature aka charge-back, and depending on a free-lunch economic model (that paid by the block subsidies), its prospects would be very doubting.
However, it could instead be the backbone and building blocks of various innovative products and services. It could be a settlement layer which unites many heterogeneous transaction systems as a true 'inter'-net of money. Promoting the least interesting and shallow application of bitcoin at all costs is really disappointing.

If the minimum spec of a node becomes data center class, even common developers are unable to afford to test a node at their own computers. Every programmer who wants to join the development would have to be backed by an enterprise.


Because the impacts are permanent and irrecoverable and I don't like a urgent/hurry/desperate workaround fix on the protocol level.


I would support it if it were not for linear-extrapolation of transaction capacity and some abusive usages/business-models in a hurry. I hope raising the limit would bring about a fundamental progress, not just "buying us some more time".
The internet has perhaps 5 ~ 7 layers or more of protocols. The bitcoin protocol has only layer-0 so far. So I don't think it's time to worry about too many layers yet.

Some a-littile-bit-off-topic thoughts:
At first I can not understand what the motivations are behind the aggressiveness of some larger blocks proponents. It's quite unusual that disagreements of a technical issue can be so hostilely argued and even involved heavily with public opinion manipulations. However, I think I have eventually figured out something by reading up the comments from several major proponents of larger blocks.
I am not sure how many of you have ever sold the idea of bitcoin being 'a low fee Visa/MasterCard alternative', either by giving formal speeches in public or casual conversations with friends. I can feel that the 'urgency' of larger blocks basically comes from the pressure of delivering what has been intensively marketed by some people (or the community as a whole), and attempting to save the reputation (either for personal or the bitcoin 'brand') from failing to fulfill that promise.
Therefore, the larger block proponents will refuse any 'excuses', no matter how logically valid or technically superior they are, if the 'real' concern is not mitigated. Because this is a *business* from their perspectives, not merely an engineering issue! And the boss is worrying about what the engineers aren't aware of or don't care much about.
I hope those who disagree on larger block can understand this, and probably providing solutions if possible. Otherwise the conversations which have been always revolving around technical and engineering perspectives will not have any meaningful progress.

Do you mean the feature hasn't been implemented on the UI of most major wallets? (I say most because, I guess, at least CLI crafted transactions are still available.) By the same logic, wallet authors can refuse to do their jobs because there is no working nodes with the feature for testing.
We didn't prohibit web servers and TCP/IP stacks from implementing HTTP2 and IPv6 just because no web browsers and routers were ready. So I don't think that would be a compelling reason for suspending the feature from being merged into the bitcoin daemon.

From another prospective, fixed 1MB block size means that the costs of running a node will be getting more and more economical along the way, which will probably enable some applications which are currently too costly. Say we will have widespread ultra-high bandwidth of something like 100Gb/s data-link and petabyte class storage inside car computers, smart phones and even contactless smartcards. What if bitcoin nodes are ubiquitously deployed in embedded systems and personal electronics? Small blocksize and bandwidth consumption can itself be an enabling technology.
However, scaling transaction capacity relentlessly through block size increase will kill a full set of opportunities like that. I don't think buying coffees in a cafe though smartphones is really a revolutionary accomplishment.
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:04:50
I know many people have concerns about the impacts to the price of bitcoin regarding the blocksize debate.
1. Higher transaction volumes don't necessarily translate into higher bitcoin price. If any, it could possibly be the opposite. If we apply the quantity theory of money to the case, higher 'velocity of bitcoin' would lead to price inflation of the goods. In other words, the currency would become less worth.
2. Increases of the sales of bitcoin receiving businesses may imply that the bitcoin economy is running trade deficit to import too much goods from the USD economy, given that most of those businesses are not 'domestic' in that they don't price their products in bitcoin. That would depress the exchange rate of BTC/USD as well.
Believe it or not, I just provide another viewpoint about the fundamentals of bitcoin's price.
@_date: 2015-07-24 06:59:23


You're essentially socializing the cost of a blockchain that will can only be used by a tiny fraction of the devices &amp; people that are storing it
First off, the potentials are not limited by what you (and I) just imagined. Also, ubiquitous deployment is a good thing for decentralization. If running a node is cheap enough, the utility it provides can be beyond the revenue directly generated from the processing subsidies and transaction fees. For example, I think any developer who runs a node is not just for making money. Nodes that form a virtual private network like mining pools might enable applications that not viable through just one big node (e.g. DDoS attack. Okay, just kidding).

The fundamental design of the Blockchain technology does not aim for solving that kind of problems -- low latency and massive throughput data storage and transmission. It's algorithmically inefficient for that. The correct order to solve the problem is to choose appropriate algorithm, data structure and system architecture first. Upgrading memory, processor and bandwidth can help, but it should not be prioritized over algorithm and architecture solutions especially when it comes to permanent impacts.
Leveraging technologies that are excellent at other aspects on top of the foundation will serve our purpose more effectively. Also Bitcoin itself is a combination of various technologies which offer different essences. 
Every design has its trade-offs, and "one size fits all" often leads to a bad one.

There is a blind spot: Number of transactions is not equal to number of users.
It's similar to stock market that a small fraction of institutional day traders or HFT companies account for most proportion of all trades and volumes.

The rationale matters. I might agree an increase of the block limit or even complete elimination of the limit if a sensible rationale is proposed. But I am not sold by the presented reasons by the advocates. Yet there are indeed valid technical and economic reasons against it.
I am aware of the issue you mentioned regarding micro-payments. It is expected to, and can only to, be systematically solved by advanced payment-channel technologies.
I think we can both agree that the modest increase (or even complete elimination of the limit) can only be a "buying-time" solution if the growth of bitcoin usage is really exponential as expected. 
My pipe-dreamed alternative reality is that all businesses involved in the *big* problem can work together with the technical community (namely the Core developers) to help accelerate the development and deployment of a true solution rather than lobbying for a cost-me-least quick answer.

One of the big problems of the conventional payment solutions is you have to trust a third-party and let it keep your personal information.  Even if it is a trustful one, it can cause big troubles one day when it's hacked. If we can have a way to verify our transaction counter-parties independently, it can enable us to do transactions *online* without signing up a particular third-party service provider.
If I understand correctly, using the wallets on mobile phones still requires you sending the transactions or querying the ledger through a third-party remote server.

I would say most average users aren't going to be affected by this.
I've said this somewhere else and let me say it again.
Number of transactions is not equal to number of users. It's more plausible that a small fraction of pro-players account for most of the transaction volumes like what can be observed in other financial markets.
It's similar to stock market that a small fraction of institutional day traders or HFT companies account for most proportion of all trades and volumes. In that case, the average stock investors would not be the most sensitive ones freaking out about the rises of transaction taxes and fees. Likewise, the most impacted ones of any transaction fee rising of bitcoin would NOT be normal bitcoin holders or the people doing casual shopping. 
It's like an HFT company wants to stop the increase of transaction taxes, and meanwhile complaining with the excuse that it's would be devastating for the helpless and innocent average retail investors.

The value proposition about bitcoin is very about the immutability. The immutability includes the fixed money supply, the ledger, and the consensus rules. Bitcoin used to undergo upgrades, but they are for bug fixes, mostly related to security vulnerabilities. It has never been changed for economic **interests** of any participants of the ecosystem.
This has deeper implications than it sounds like yet another software update. That gives its participants the confidence that the 21m number is real, not something that would be changed if some big enough businesses are falling into troubles. Will we have to "2x" the number of bitcoin supply if some powerful industry alliance demands it? I think the market has reasonably decided to take a step back and "calm down" about the fate of bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general.

One superiority of bitcoin among other claimed decentralized altcoins(Ripple is not decentralized as it's advertised) is that the author of bitcoin removes the authority of himself from the system. He doesn't go around making speeches, nor be interviewed on television like a celebrity.
Therefore, bitcoin can't be attacked because of the author being accused of sexual misconduct or other scandals, which may destroy the credibility of the artifact even if the protocol itself is flawless.
So if the disappearance (of Satoshi) is an intent action, all I can say is he really understands the meaning of 'single point of failure' and has implemented the whole 'scheme' very wisely.

If the goal is to approach higher employment rate as possible regardless of any side-effects, then it's the most valid argument so far out of all proponents' smoke.
But the problem is, resources are scarce. And all entrepreneurs, companies, industries, and sectors are competing for them. Monetary inflation or more straightly, bailouts, may stimulates or rescues a company or an industry temporarily . But fulfilling one's satisfaction unreservedly also implies starving the others. Even if money is becoming abundant, __real__ resources aren't. Attempting to fortify the existed economic structure also hinder its self-adjustment and steady evolution for the future. It's like a game rule against challengers and in favor of existed winners. In the end, when the unbalance is unmaintainable, larger scale energy-releasing/collapsing will go its way like what we have seen.

Inflation of currency can't prevent people from hoarding other assets. Bank savings(or certificate of deposit) are no fundamentally different than corporate bonds in the case of hoarding. In other words, fiat money is kind of unsecured bonds without maturity date issued by governments. If the bonds suck, people just turn to other bonds, stocks or other instruments for avoiding losses. There are still many economics issues confusing me but the old and repeated argument about the goodness of inflation is still far from sound reasoning to me.

Not exactly. Monetary inflation has deep impacts on long term evolution of economy, like wealth distribution and resources arrangement. It's like an intervention to an ecological system, or drug addiction, which might alleviate symptom immediately but could harm the physiological system permanently. As you probably know, monetary inflation also transfers wealth from fixed-income people to assets holder.

It seems like your major concern on the subject is related to social welfare and support services. I don't  disagreed with that.

Briefly, they have to at least separate their front ends and backends.
For example, they can set up a 'public' relay server, which is only responsible for verification and redirecting all incoming connections to a group of 'protected' front servers. The protected servers always accept only verified connections redirected from the aforementioned public front ends. In turn,  one or a group of private backend servers, which are isolated from the internet, run the actual business within their private LAN. With such configuration, only the 'public' front ends have to deal with unpredictable connections, and only the 'public' and 'protected' front ends are exposed to the internet.

What you are talking about is price inflation, typically referring to some kind of price index like CPI. It can be influenced by, but isn't equal to, monetary inflation. Of course increasing the money supply in a price dropping situation can be more possible to keep the CPI not going wild.

Hoarding money is no harm as long as the unspent money is 'useless'. That being said, if food, water, oil, lands, houses or some useful scarce resource were used as currency, the hoarding would indeed harm others by preventing others from utilizing. An inflationary currency just rewards people who hoard those useful assets. Think again, it's whether inflationary or deflationary which may have contribution to Warren Buffett's fortune?

The reason for preference of inflation are taught in the fresh year at related departments of almost all colleges and universities. But if one has more carefully comprehension or extensive exposure to economics other than Keynesianism, he would find the argument is not convincing enough.
Regarding the issue of investment, even if a fiat currency is kind of deflation, it's usually saved in banks by the hoarders rather than storing the money in their refrigerator or closet tank. The banks definitely will invest or speculate something with the savings. In other words, the hoarders lend their money to banks, trading high profit opportunities for risk-less(ideally of course) but lower fixed income, namely the interest. Given that there is no bank involved, deflation means all goods become cheaper, including capital goods, which in turn will give rise to potential investment opportunities for entrepreneurs. It's a fair game for either investing or saving if there is no inflation and bailout. Both credit side and debit side suffer opportunity cost of choice. In summary, deflation has equilibrium but inflation doesn't.
Exercise: If there is inflation and bailout, which side, credit or debit, borrower or lender, would be more advantageous than the other?

Price is defined as the exchange ratio of two commodities, which is irrelevant to the percentage of someone's income. And by definition, increasing of price is by no means attributed to either monetary deflation or price deflation.  Inflation is inflation, not deflation. Even if they would be perhaps causational. Winter is winter, not spring. And provided that monetary supply is stationary, the so-called price deflation can only be caused by either decreasing of the demand or overproducing, namely __excess capacity__. It's a time for self-correction rather than cultivating the unsustainable bubble.

[Wikipedia:Scarcity in economics]( for your reference.
Scarcity of a good is irrelevant to its price by (economic) definition. And again, price is the exchange ratio of two scarce goods.  Therefore even though a good is relative cheap to other ones, it's still scarce in terms of economics. It's also irrelevant to how people employ it. Time is scarce resource even if people can waste it. 
Let me clarify further. An economic system is dynamic, and is envolved, not designed. It is always changing its form and structure, which is probably only visible in a larger scale of time. But it's obvious that the whole things one hundred years ago are very different than that of nowadays. People's demands are changing, and the suppliers adjust themselves to catch up. In the process, not only individuals may lose their job, but also companies probably disappeared,  and even a whole industry may be extinct. Hundreds years ago the agriculture sector perhaps occupied more than half of the GDP but today it composes only a small fraction. Consumers drive the transition, determining who can be prosperous, and who deserve to decline. When we are shopping in a mall, picking goods only by their price, we are responsible for job outsourcing and manufacturing overseas. 
Now do you still believe monetary inflation and bailouts can prevent american farmers in 19th century from losing their job and keep the same population of agriculture sector doing their decent job till today?

In real world, an inflation currency doesn't prevent people from hoarding their wealth. As we all know, those rich people are rich absolutely not because of their savings in the bank.
