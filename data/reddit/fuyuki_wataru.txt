Honestly believe that this is only the beginning. Yes it might take another 3-5 years to get the blockchain mainstream, but don't let that discourage you. A few years is nothing.
Disagree with their chart from 2015. Cryptocurrencies in their chart shows that it goes down, but based on these charts it shows that it actually goes up in 2015...

Of course, they did. 
Local elections are in June. No one is going to make a statement / ban cryptocurrencies because no one wants to risk losing voters.
The majority of young people in Korea support the movement of cryptocurrencies (don't underestimate the amount of support for crypto, because it's also linked with the fact that Korea is supposed to be a democracy and citizens want to see market freedom. Funny thing is when reading comments there everyone bashes their government for looking like the Northen government. Telling people what to do, what they can't do etc).
If a ban will arrive, it will be somewhere at the end of the year. Until then you will hear more fake and fud stories about a possible ban.

Just so you know, I sold a tiny part of my cryptos because I had to pay some bills. I think this can be applied for many users.
No one around me is selling because of a ''crackdown''. Not sure if I would call it a crackdown either, more like looking to register some additional details of users using cryptocurrencies.

Actually not true. It's a few whales working together to make everyone believe that Bitcoin is now a stable coin, and worth investing in and using as a currency. There are massive buy orders at a few dollars below to prevent the price from falling. There are sell orders a few dollars above, to keep the price from raising too much. What's changed a lot now though is that their using bots to auto buy a few coins per second, so you can't see the walls they out up. Only a bit longer and the whales won't be able to keep control.

I believe it allows crypto exchanges to operate in the EU if they give information on their users. Think Poloniex, Kraken, etc. It's already being done with some exchanges in China like Yunbi. They want to know who you are. 
Anyways thanks to Ethereum we now have smart contracted decentralized exchanges that they cannot shut down. So even if they enforce all these rules and people want to remain anonymous they can just switch to a decentralized exchange...

The fact alone that we dropped to $5000 goes to show how much of we are on thin-ice.

If you don't have it, see what your lawyer thinks about this idea something along the lines as: contact him and ask if he used your brothers computer about 2 years ago, when he was deceased, and make sure it's on paper. 
2)   Was the computer password protected?
3) Post the address that the coins where send to, maybe some Bitcoiners can help try and find out 
which exchange he has used to cash out. Then we can try and contact the exchange for extra help. 
Hopefully this guy has sold his Bitcoins through a exchange where he was verified with his passport/address and then I think you'll have a solid case.
EDIT: Also you need to act fast, the guy might be reading this subreddit and he might come across this post.
Good luck.

Here's what I do
*   I look at the bigger picture. Remember why you took the decision you took and try to stick with it (still, sometimes you've made the wrong decision/strategy and you have to create a new one. Don't blindly ignore it.)
* I try to avoid cash, physical cash. Don't hold or see physical cash so you can't really put any value on it (works for me). Don't become dependent on the money either. If you live a expensive life because you make a lot of money, guess what happens when you make a few bad investments? You'll worry that you have to sell your lambo if you fuck it up... and then you do.
* I go to rand watch cute videos of animals. Watching cute videos of animals helps with cheering me up.

Btc e was one of the first exchanges to trade on. They where accused left and right, because of the language barrier and lack of insight into their services.

Won't be able to access the websites at all because their flagged/blocked. This means Chinese citizens will have to use VPNs, but unfortunately the Chinese government is also starting to track these down, making it more and more difficult. 
Therefore it would be wise that if the ban is true, and you are a Chinese citizen who managed to get his coins on another exchange outside of China... to either send the coins back to a Chinese exchange or sell it all together and keep it in USD.
Or just move to another country. But whose going to do that?

I think you'll be fine with trading your usd for Bitcoin. Do note that your usd that you held is now converted into usdwex, which should be bought back by wex. So if you held 10,000 usd, you now have worth around 4,000 usd in wex tokens. Holding your usd on the exchange and not selling immediately might increase the chance of getting your entire usd amount before the exchange shutdown happened, back.
Its at the token tabs, the prices that wex offers to pay. Anyway I don't work there so I might be wrong.

I really don't know. In short term I think we might dip further than everyone is willing to admit. We have given millions to useless icos who also hold btc and will cash out. And... We also have too many alt coins inflated, those will need to burst.

This is exactly why I warned a lot of people to sit it out. This was a classic bull trap, making users think the price is going up because a few shorters got out. Eventually the price will slowly... decrease over time and panic sets in, starting the next chaos trip to the bottom.

The majority of news such as bans or hacks seem to stem from Asian countries.
Due to the language barrier it is often difficult to sense whether or not a news story is legit or not, as well as the differences in usage of platforms/communities makes it harder to debunk fake news.
Some users are aware of this and know it may take up to 8 hours for news to be debunked. In the mean time it's OK (in their eyes) to try and publish rumors or fake news to influence the price. Also why are the pictures blurred out? 
Be aware of this and don't let yourself get fooled young warriors!

Sorry to hear, but let's be realistic here. Perhaps this might help with overcoming this. 
Chances are extremely likely that you would've sold your coins.

Few years ago I was already suspecting how profitable it was for Russia to back Le Pen. Cause havoc in the EU and turn the countries against themselves. When reports emerged that Le Pen received millions in private campaign donations from Russian bank accounts I knew.
If she wins, then I don't know anymore. All polls are indicating that she doesn't really have a chance at all. And the users on social media don't seem to vote for her, and in real life I haven't met anyone either. But the same could be applied to Brexit and Donald Trump. If she does win it might be a good idea to start investigating whether or not our electronic voting counting system hasn't been hacked by a foreign government.

Me. All the time. And they even say that I don't have any money because it isn't real. So yeah, where do all these vacations, trips and other capitalistic materials come from huh? 
Either way it's fine, more for me.

The only paper from the 80s I know is the Phoenix currency.

Perhaps this?

You will have to go through intensive checks of KYC and AML when using exchanges in the future (EU report on crypto). Besides do not surprised if you will have to list whether or not you own cryptocurrencies when entering the US in the future.
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:46:16
Perhaps I jumped the gun here a bit too quickly, but I haven't watched the video yet. The headline does give a clear picture of what the subject is, and I believe I'm ok informed about the latest developments. 
The reports I've seen that come from US are a few politicians asking for harsh rules on Cryptocurrencies, but most likely will not be able to do anything with it (which we already know) because there isn't enough support, right now.
If we look at the EU, EU reports are not indicating a ban, but regulation. They even list that the currencies aren't used by terrorists either but the currencies impose a great risk for the future as terrorists might start using it. Thus the decision is to impose regulations at the end of the 2017 and create a database with all active cryptocurrency users in EU.

While that may be true, Jihan still has great influence over miners and seems to always have something up his sleeve. What may have great support now may no longer be tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:50:45
Don't trade crypto then. 
There's no regulation here. Poloniex.com is rich af and has a army of lawyers, you won't be able to compete.

If anything, this investment will be 100x bigger than internet investors. Because this one is already connected and anyone can participate.

Well can't say he is not entirely wrong. Money changes people ;)
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:46:02
Interesting. The average amount of active users on Poloniex is only 33,000. Compared to 48,000 during the bull-run. So I am not seeing any activity increase on Poloniex. You would say with such a enormous growth other exchanges would benefit, but they haven't.
@_date: 2017-07-19 11:49:07
From a outsider perspective, this whole crypto space looks like one big joke. 
Edit: It seems that many users are implying that I think this space is one big joke. I'm not calling this space a joke. I'm calling it a joke from the perspective of those who are not invested in this new emerging technology, from my experience when I speak with those who are not invested in this technology the so called average joe. Miners, hardfork, 51% attack, all new gaming/it/nerdy terms. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:21:19


Yeah that's going to be difficult lol. For some people Bitcoin isn't just a technology but also a ideology. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:13:40

Looks like the Editor in charge @ CNBC is actively trading in the crypto community. They opened the flood gates of negative articles about Bitcoin/Ethereum/Blockchain since two days ago.
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:30:21
Just wait. I've been waiting for 2 months for them to reply. 
It's absurd, but the user growth they have experienced is absurd as well. Your lawyer will only cost you money.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:53:35
A new update is on the website - Which website?
Yes 
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:47:15
Yes. And in a few days he will stop signaling and go in the opposite direction, causing a market crash. This goes on... and on... Even if he doesn't chance his stance, end of November we will have another potential hard-fork. Then he will play this game again.
@_date: 2017-07-19 11:59:40
I said from a outsiders perspective. Someone who isn't familiar with crypto starts reading about miners etc
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:12:57
The rally has already started. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:27:27
Don't know why you have to act like that. Shit maybe I don't even want to know. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:13:47
I like it. Layout is shit but the guys behind the exchange seem friendly and honest. It's Canadian I think. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:11:46
It goes against what their signaling. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:31:28
Respect for this man. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 11:14:07
I don't know which dates. I expected them to signal BIP 91 on 24th of July, and not on 17th July. They probably have to offload their own coins before they start fucking us all over again by not signaling BIP 91 no more. And when that happens chaos is returned. Be safe
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:18:00
Or the numbers are fake, falsely interpreted.

@_date: 2017-07-18 10:37:52
It seems there won't be a split until November. But I would be cautious, because my spidery senses are telling me that at the last moment the Chinese miners will back stab us like they did before (they said they would split Bitcoin, but then yesterday said they wouldn't), and cause havoc when they start towards splitting Bitcoin. The crash that will occur once they do will be great to watch though.
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:12:06
Then how come they haven't seized the servers yet? Usually when this is happening they seize the servers. Perhaps they are CDN servers. Since when does CDN servers fall under the category of main hosting server though?
@_date: 2017-07-08 22:31:41
Total destruction. Bitcoin split into thousands of pieces and earth rotating faster than the speed of light into the sun.

This is a whole new industry, and many exchanges operated without an license in the beginning.

Don't see anything. Bullshit
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:07:29
I wouldn't trust them at all. Bitmain uses their mining power to push to pump and dump the BTC price. Don't be surprised if they suddenly change their stance at the last moment, causing major panic. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:30:05
Well if that is true, then it's funny I haven't seen any Chinese refer Johan as eunuch. I am not a fan of Jihan but this seems like spreading fake and false information. Perhaps he can link some proof. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:47:21
Bitmain always has something up their sleeve to direct the price in some direction. From shouting China Bans bitcoin every once a while through CnLedger to shouting that they will hard-fork now. It's pretty known now by veterans that Bitmain is more than just a mining company now. Can't blame them though.
@_date: 2017-05-13 15:52:02
Curious about this as well. What about mintpal? They also stole my bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:39:42
No surprise. Darkmarkets being shut down, they'll probably come after the mixers as well now. Better quit while your at the top! 
@_date: 2017-07-13 11:20:53
lol I've seen your post so many times.
Drop your BTC address and I'll send some bitcoins

How am I supposed to hold USDT or USD in my ledger?
If I'm actively trading I have to hold it on the exchange.

These are great prices to sell at before it dips under $2000 again. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:47:25
After the hardfork on 1st of August. Users who held coins there will not be able to profit from the chain split. 


2) To isolate these effects of this activity, the btc-e core trade engine and dependent applications have been quarantined
3) Work around code has been completed and tested in a sandbox environment, however:
4) BTCe should be fully functional *only after* August 1st as a contingency
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:31:06
Or sell your Bitcoins. Either way prepare yourselves because this might get ugly.

Jihan is just a business person.
I'm starting to see Proof of Work as a disaster. One person or a few selected group of individuals can block consensus. Not to mention that Proof of Work is consuming a lot of electricity, I believe it's even more than Croatia does at a daily point and thus turning this whole network/project into a non eco friendly investment. 
Perhaps Proof of Stake will present itself in the future to be a better alternative. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:03:15

It'll be replaced within a few months by anotjer coin. Bitcoin is no longer unique, we can just make a new and better version any day. The only reason it's around because exchanges profit from the back and forth trading between crypto assets which are often linked with btc.

They can't.
You have to tell them how to receive them.

True there will be negative pr but any pr is positive. This ball has rolled and can't be stopped. Blockchain will revolutionize the world. Bitcoin will be part of Blockchains history but remember Bitcoin was only the first Blockchain application, and can be replaced.
