Are you implying "insider trading" is an actual bad thing?
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:27:07
Exactly. That's the best way I've seen it put in this thread.

When was the last time 50 reporters hounded a 64-year-old man about it though? When was the last time in this context someone's house and license plate were posted on Newsweek?
Completely different.

They should rename themselves. It's seriously one of the best BTC services out there. Easiest way to do USD/BTC transactions IMO.

well, it's regulated, so you're halfway there

haha, sorry. I thought the title explained it. I have a websocket open that's looking at unconfirmed transactions on blockchain.info in real-time. Every transaction is represented by a circle relative to the size of the transaction. Similar to listentobitcoins.

Someone trying to divert attention from the exploding Dogecoin community

I love this. I signed up.

what'd it say? he deleted it.

I would also buy one for ~$50

I will not be using Mt. Gox again after this. 
This is ridiculous. I added funds to my account so I could buy as a regular user when the price bottomed out today.

man, as I was reading it, I was thinking -- "this guy's either schizophrenic or severely abusing meth" -- and it looks like you also came to the same conclusion, mentioning schizophrenia and meth in your final letter.

So, it's a bank?

Try tweeting [ -- that's worked for me a couple times. You could also try the bitinstant sticky thread on bitcointalk.org under the newbies section.
Their support from their site is basically nonexistent from my experience. You have to reach them through other channels.
