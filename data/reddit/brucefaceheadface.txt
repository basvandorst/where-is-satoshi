If you're thinking about buying, my advice is get set up and authorised on an exchange as soon as possible. Not sure if it's different in the US but there's a fair few hoops to jump through in Aus. Figure out how it works, deposit some money in and try some minimal buys, transfers out to external wallets. If I had my time over I would do this. You want to be ready, and know exactly what you're going to do when the dip comes.

That sounds like a great way to lose friends.

No one's sure of anything, but crypto in general is highly volatile and prone to massive swings. It would be a first if it didn't. No one can tell you anymore with any certainty. So as I said, just be prepared, sign up, try out some transactions, figure out what external wallet you want to use, because when/if it does happen you want to be ready to act.

Independent reserve seems to track a little higher in terms of price than BTCMarkets, but their fees are lower from memory.

It'll feel like an even bigger deal when you look back and realise you should've held and bought a Moon Lamborghini

Or because we’re experiencing the worst housing bubble the world has ever seen and no one can afford a house.

Of course, but there’s literally no evidence of money flooding from traditional markets into crypto in a correction, only the other way around. So personally I know my plan of attack when it eventuates.

I mentioned that. The recent downtrend in crypto was exacerbated by the stock market having its worst day since 2011. Here in Australia it was the worst performance since the GFC in 2008. Go and have a look at corresponding dates, you’ll see it too. I watch all markets, and while a lot of people think money will flood into crypto in a down market the opposite was true for the big dip traditional markets just had. As I also mentioned, I think when do have the next GFC crypto will recover faster than traditional stock markets/realestate markets, so it’ll be a great time to buy crypto. I just think saying 2018 is the last time we’ll see $10,000 is optimistic depending on when (not if) the next GFC arrives.

I wouldn’t be too confident, crypto still hasn’t lived through its first GFC. The recent downtrend was helped along by similar massive losses in traditional markets. Next GFC seems like it could be really close too, and whenever it does hit, it’ll take crypto with it. At least initially, but I’m also banking on crypto recovering a lot faster than traditional markets too.
