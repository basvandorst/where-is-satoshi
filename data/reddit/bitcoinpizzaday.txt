I had actually found Laszlo's address, but he moved before I could mail him a invitation, and I wasn't able to find his new one, so unfortunately he won't be making it to the party unless he finds out otherwise. That said, my goal for next year, (or this year if the community is kind enough) is to establish a pizza for life fund for Laszlo. The man deserves two pizzas every May 22nd for the rest of his life for what he did.

Hey how's everyone doing? I hope you're doing well. If you weren't already aware, Bitcoin Pizza Day is this Friday, May 22nd. I created this website for the Bitcoin community to share Bitcoin Pizza Day events with their friends, their community and the world. If you want to list an event you can easily do so from the front end of the site and I'll be online most of the day today to approve postings. As of right now there's one submission that I've approved. So submit your parties, and have a great time celebrating the 5th anniversary of this piece of Bitcoin history.

That sounds like a decent idea. I'd be into it. We'll see the community response here and go from there.
