I got the dark cherry one myself. Hate to say avoid the cinnamon rolls but Anne Sather's has the monopoly on that. Props for the support. When I can I'll check out Ember Smoke Shop and give them some bitlove too.

For those of you outside of Chicago I ask you show your digital support by telling them what you think of them accepting bitcoin on their facebook page here:

Sweet I'll drop by there soon. On the phone they said no one's used it yet so I call first.
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:43:14
Who knows but I rather encourage them to accept it than do nothing.
@_date: 2014-04-18 16:45:54
Sure thing. I go to Glenn's once every 2 weeks and hit up the bars by you every now and then. In the meantime take care of that bitbaby! lol.

Dinosaurs voted against asteroid research and we know how that went.

In Chicago there's very few businesses accepting bitcoin this could be because there are no bitcoin users in Chicago so no user to fund such businesses or they simply don't know businesses that do accept bitcoin. It's up to all parties in a decentralized system to support each other, otherwise we should just use centralized systems and pretty much be slaves to whatever they give us.

Compared to what those who use gold, federal reserve notes, the euro?
I have no way to determine how many users are in Chicago but their should be more here than in most US cities except CA and NY.
Based on what?
I don't think the business is expecting anything from accepting bitcoins the owner is just trying it out when I asked him. If bitcoin users don't support each other then they should not expect support from anyone else but with that mentality bitcoin never grows, disappears, or is regulated to death (which is happening right now because no one is stopping it).

Nice. I'm over by Irving and Broadway. Hoping to get more places to take bitcoin but it's a process. I'm always up for meeting fellow bitcoiners in the city at dive bars then chatting up the owners into accepting it. One of these days it will pay off.

I found the 1st one! It was ironically on top of their ATM but instead of giving out federal reserve notes it gave me bitcoins!
It was stuck on pretty tight so I just left the tag there but they are noticeable if you have an idea of where to look.
Thanks so much for doing projects like this Chicago needs more active groups doing fun things like this.
@_date: 2014-04-18 16:25:41
Awesome! Are you in the area often?
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:40:20
Lack of security is insecurity. Surprise!
@_date: 2014-04-18 16:56:10
When I asked then they said they had few users was using it so I do understand why would anyone accept it if no one is going. I'm hoping you guys can show them people do use it and care. When are you in Chicago next?
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:54:50
I'm not affiliated with the business but I don't think they have posted anywhere online. So spread the word!
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:42:02
I don't think the owner is trying that hard to reach out to anyone he seems to just think it's cool and likes offering it. But for accepting it he deserves the support of the bitcoin community imho.

Hey Chicago bitcoin users. Would love your feedback here. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:47:31
Your welcome! I've been going a few times a week just because it's refreshing to actually spend bitcoins at a cafe and I suggest the grass fed chili.
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:48:34
What good is people showing they support small businesses accepting bitcoin? If you don't know you're not human or much of a bitcoin fan. Also being your first and only post screams spammer try adding to the conversation than bringing it down with negativity.
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:34:23
Right? Thanks for the comment.
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:45:54
Awesome but I'm just a user. It's great to see other users support each other much like a real life decentralized network.
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:42:23
World's a small place even for bitcoiners!

Most people on the planet don't make enough to buy a latte everyday.
Like I said he didn't seem to expect any massive sales and I don't think he's doing it for marketing more because he just likes it although it's funny when companies like overstock accept it they make bank.

For those too lazy to link.
"Hello Crypto-Chicagoans.
Starting today our group will be "tagging" Chicago with bitcoin. We are putting NFC tags in bars all over the Chicagoland area containing a backup of an encrypted Bitcoin wallet key with values ranging from $1 to $100.
Requirements: You must have an Android smartphone with a NFC reader and have a bitcoin wallet installed. Also the password for all wallets is chicago to make it easy for everyone and all tags are locked for your safety.
After finding the tags post your find here and tell us what you think. I'll post more information when the team meets up at Big Chick's tonight to go over our mission.
Message us for any questions, hints, or support! Message us for any questions, hints, or support!"

Yeah it is. Maybe when the bitcoin atms show up things will change.
