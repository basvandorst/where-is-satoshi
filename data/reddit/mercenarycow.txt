That money I invested was already taxed when I earned it. Why does uncle Sam have to double dip when I do things with it

Once firm, it becomes much easier to slice thinly and add to sandwiches or hamburgers.
@_date: 2019-07-23 13:13:36
I'm so conflicted... By now? Or wait to see if it hits 9k
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:27:33
Lol shit. I got a notification at work today that it was like 9800 or something. Finally have some time to look at everything and wouldn't ya know it, it's almost 11500 already. Guess I'll hold off til tomorrow haha. This bitcoin thing varies wildly

So I want to start investing in bitcoin. I'm thinking about putting money in every week, or every other week. I used coinbase for my first purchase. It's my understanding that I need to transfer this to a wallet now? If so, what wallet is a good and simple one to use? Also, how is coinbase as an exchange app? I noticed the fees on it and I wonder if it's worth using or if other apps have less fees.
I'm just looking to buy at regular intervals and keep it safe. Also is it worth investing in any other coin? Specifically looking at this bitcoin cash here.
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:07:48
10k is 10k. I'd say keep it, and give them bitcoin to equal the value it was when they originally bought it. If they bought it for them when a coin was 20 bucks, then.. Give them 20 bucks in bitcoin again
@_date: 2019-07-07 00:34:05
Examples? Like.. Bury it your backyard or something?

I never seen that joke before, wow! So good!
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:13:56
What's all the terminology used here mean?
Hodl? Halfing? Bull? Bubble? Ledger? Etc...
@_date: 2019-11-25 02:45:42
To me I just get big money signs in my eyes. Cus I can buy for cheap and it's going to go back up.
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:53:44
Dips more, buy more. Throw all the money at it
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:42:09
I've heard of that trick. And I've tried it twice.
The first time I did it. I did 100, and after an hour like 10 bucks was available to transfer. The next day like another 40 was. Took a few days to do it. The 2nd time I tried it, I couldn't transfer anything for like a week
@_date: 2019-08-16 21:06:11
How could I give somebody bitcoin? Let's say for example I wanted to just get 100 bucks and give it to them somehow. It's somebody who doesn't use it. So they don't have any kind of wallet. Either they can just put it in a filing cabinet it or a safe or something and hopefully they'd get interested eventually and get their own wallet and start buying and holding themselves. Or they'd just realize in 10 years that bitcoin is now 10mil and they got a cool 100k they didn't realize they had.
@_date: 2019-10-03 22:09:02
Yeah. The app is $3 upto a $200 purchase.
After that, it's a percentage of your total purchase. It's a lot more. I used coinbase pro website because it was like 15 cents compared to 3 dollars.
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:49:41
How much is maxing?
@_date: 2019-10-03 21:12:21
I don't mind too much the extra fee. What bothers me is it takes like 2 weeks between putting money into coinbase pro and actually being able to buy bitcoin with it. If I'm paying more fees, they should speed that up
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:45:03
My work matches upto 5%. So I just do that. I don't even know how it makes money outside of me putting the 5% in and my work matching that. 
I don't even know what an IRA is... I also don't have a good job anyways.
@_date: 2019-08-19 01:23:41
So.. How should I store bitcoin? I been thinking about getting a hardware wallet lately
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:55:02
All the bitcoins I can possibly get my hands on until I can retire off of it.
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:58:44
That literally happened to me yesterday... That extra half hour is going straight into bitcoin anyway
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:15:08
"few dozen coins"
How much you buy weekly? I been doing $100 increments and still don't even have half of one coin haha
@_date: 2019-06-29 21:48:13
Should I really watch this as a newbie? Or is this some bullshit?
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:56:10
I need a better paying job so I can throw more money into the bitcoin....
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:29:59
Why do I see some people saying around here that DCA is a myth?
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:46:35
My "portfolio" is whatever is happening to the 5% i put into the work 401k thing that they match. And some into bitcoin. How stupid am I?
I literally have no idea what's going on with the 401k since I've never looked at it once in the 5 years I've been doing it....
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:18:21
How do I do this in coinbase?
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:13:37
And it's still $3 for the same trade on the app.
And I basically only buy bitcoin in $100 amounts every once in a while. It's a long long road to 1 bitcoin. But I'm not too concerned with the fees.
Honestly right now, I need to figure out how to do a wallet
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:57:18
That's too much for me.. But I can put some away.
What is a Roth? And an IRA? And a vanguard? And vtsax? What are these words and how do you make money from it?
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:52:18
My coins are on coinbase. How do I move them to a wallet? Is it free? What wallet should I use?
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:28:07
Oh sorry I'm a different guy who was reading you argue with him
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:52:03
So I went into this doing no research at all, just going off of the advice of a guy at work. Seems like a mistake. I put $200 in yesterday when it was 12k, and the highest my 200 went was like 225. It's at 175 now. 
Guess I'm an idiot. But the whole bitcoin thing interests me and I'd like to do some research and figure out how I should invest in bitcoin smartly. I'll have to look around this subreddit and read up when I get home. 
For the time being, can anybody recommend what I should do with the mistake I've done? Should I just keep it, or sell it for now?
Edit: thanks for all the advice. I'm going to hold onto what I have and not worry about it. It seems like it's a smart idea to invest incrementally. So I'll look into that, and maybe sit down every week and put $100-200 when I see it lower.
Edit 2: do you guys invest in other coins as well, specifically bitcoin cash? Or do you just do your investments in bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:58:58
So you're saying to basically buy small amounts of bitcoin in like every check?
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:03:17
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:58:07
I was going to do a lot more, but I figured I'd go small to start just to see what happens. And it plummeted right away lol
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:15:34
What's a bull run? And halfing? I didn't invest anything I couldn't afford to lose. That's why I just put in 200. I'll hold onto it
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:44:42
Imagine if bitcoin became illegal and the government forced all companies in the US to shut down that act ad a marketplace or whatever.
I think that would make it drop close enough to zero as everybody tries to abandon ship
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:08:46
This is why I have a reminder to put $100 into coinbase pro every week.
I keep dismissing every time, so I have no money in coinbase pro to buy the dip ��
