According to you, Seth bet only for  so you should consider all the others as Kane's win. Kane didn't bet that $200 would happen before $2000, just accepted Seth's bet.

I have done literally nothing to help his money was gone before I ever heard of BitGo. If we didn't know what was the problem, he would be in exact same situation.
Except now he knows whom to blame: both actions that were required for the bug to happen were done by the same person, and the same person could have fixed it.

The original MMM caused losses of between 5 to 10 billion dollars, and it operated only in the countries of the former USSR (300 million inhabitants) and before the internet. 
Bitcoin's market capitalisation is 6 billion dollars. So if you took all the money lost in the original MMM and put into bitcoin, the price could double.
This time, MMM targets multiple developing countries like India, RSA, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, or Peru. I do not know what is the total amount scammed out so far, but it's possible it's several billions.


The same reason a standard pyramid scheme uses actual money, except for the fact that bitcoin is less regulated and easier to move around.


Paycoin is sooo 2013. Also, the whole point of a pyramid scheme is getting money from the gullible, and if not money, then something that could be easy sold for money. Printing their own fake currency means nothing if they can't sell it – and they can't do it for money, since their [bank accounts can easily be frozen.]( 
Besides, they do have their own scam tokens:

[Colombian peso]( and [Dominican peso]( use $ too.
And I also agree that Thai were first and ฿ is theirs.
Bitcoin is a new currency, so it need a totally new symbol.

Why are you using [peso]( sign to refer to other currencies?
