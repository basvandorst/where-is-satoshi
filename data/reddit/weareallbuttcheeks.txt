And I very much hope it does change the world for the better. It just seems awfully suspicious because I hear the exact same stuff from Bitcoin enthusiasts as I do from scammers. If it looks and sounds like a Ponzi scheme... ya know?

If you say so ��

Oh, I've heard it plenty of times. It's also really, really weird that literally everyone who's into Bitcoin uses the same set of buzzwords and phrases. "Just trying to share the wealth." Sure you are. Just like how car salesman are passing the savings on to you, and timeshares are an incredible deal you'd be insane to miss out on! Maybe bitcoin is the exception, but any other time someone's trying to get you into something (other than a job) with the claim that  "you'll make money!" is usually a scheme of some sort. You've gotta realize that.

That's a great story!

People call it a scam because you guys make it sound like a scam. "You're missing a once in a lifetime opportunity!" "It's totally not a bubble!"

No, I don't think that. If you're making money off it, seriously, congratulations. It's just that all signs point to it being a scam. Not sure why Bitcoin enthusiasts refuse to see that.. . Oh wait, cognitive dissonance.

I know that it's grown, I'm not blind. It's just extremely suspicious to me that people are so eager to get other people involved. I'm not saying you can't make money off it. People make money off Ponzi schemes.
