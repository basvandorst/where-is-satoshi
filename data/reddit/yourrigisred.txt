Meshnets won't be able to reach everywhere. At best they would function within larger cities, but they wouldn't have any external connections outside of that. IMO each larger city able to create a meshnet would utilize its own crypto within the meshnet. Outside of that and in rural areas or checkpoints, metals would be used. Electricity is easy enough, with solar, wind, and those are hopefully improving all the time (though sometimes I question solar).

I think that is more about the dmv and regs than visa. Visa fees are maybe $0.30 and in many larger places they aren't a direct consumer fee because the overall costs charged by visa are spread throughout the prices of products. Such as with walmart. Smaller places, such as very local gas stations, will require minimum purchases with credit cards. Why they don't just use Square or the other similar pay systems is beyond me.

no it wouldn't. read the actual net neutrality documents. yeah it is a daunting and repetitive piece over 300 pages. net neutrality is an in your face example of double think.
Netflix threw a tantrum about getting charged more for the bandwidth that is used (infrastructure and networks are expensive). So they went to the fcc about it with other streaming services and cried about it. then made the completely false claims that isp's are going to block sites. ISP's aren't going to do that no matter how crappy they are with customer service. it would easily allow competition to come in. they don't want that (which, surprise surprise, Net Neutrality regulations out the smaller competitions).
it would only effect consumers who stream netflix 20+ hours a week. 
remember before net neutrality? probably not, maybe you too. people paid 50+ a month at one time for dial up. eventually that got cheaper because infrastructure and technology allowed it to get cheaper. 
this continues today as fiber is increasing in various areas along with new technology such as what century link's G.Fast does.
