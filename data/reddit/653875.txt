Lets not rule out non-determinism. Perhaps some things occur without cause. Perhaps there is no system to observe.

So predictable there was an amendment about it written into our Constitution over 200 years ago.

Yea, but Mastercard and Coinbase are implements of surveillance. Coinbase account money is not a cash/gold equivalent like bitcoin. And who needs yet another mastercard based on dollars, gold, dong, btc, or otherwise?

Block size should be zero. The cost of bitcoin is too damn high!

NAMBLA can publicy donate to you. You can't hide how much money you have from anyone with access to your body. Someone will eventually dissamble you looking for the private key.

Gold is hard to fake too. Bars and coins can be faked because people don't want to bend, drill, hammer, or melt them. But a false 24ct gold wedding band will be found out immediately. You can fake one attribute such as density, reactivity, or hardness but good luck faking several at once. If we went back to bending links off a gold chain it would be pretty hard to counterfeit.
