I believe what you're looking for is "There are no anarchists in Goxholes".

Actually, the reason I've yet to buy anything with BTC is precisely because tracking and reporting gains is a headache, and I intend to be compliant even on the proverbial cup of coffee.
The thing is: this is hard now, but it doesn't have to be— all this information is in computers, the calculation of taxes could be completely automatic, it just takes having software that cares. First step would probably be adding a standardized, optional way of denoting fiat cost in the payment protocol, the rest would be pretty easy to do entirely in a client.

You can. There's a dropdown when creating a sell order. You can even charge a negative premium if you're ~~laundering money~~ feeling generous.

Gemini doesn't have limits on Wire withdraws. I think you could also use something like itBit (but I don't really understand dark pools or arranged transactions).

I don't think you understood the proposal. The block reward halvening is also a promise about the future, but people aren't particularly concerned about it being kept.
The point is that the "promise" isn't done with a handshake in a room, it would be baked into the same code that activates segwit. To break the promise would require an active code change, which could be viewed as a hard fork of its own.
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:51:05
Totally agree that it'd be hard to find a metric that's difficult to game. I suspect people could find something though, if they were on board with the general concept.

It seems like the impasse is that small blockers want to avoid any kind of HF if at all possible, while big blockers are afraid of losing their leverage if they allow SW to activate and it proves to be insufficient. Saying SW+2MB soon doesn't really help either side. The small blockers still have to swallow a HF, and the big blockers don't trust that the capacity increase will actually happen, or that it will be sufficient if it does.
I think a possible solution that might be feasible is to accept a SW proposal that formally codifies a *conditional* hardfork. Obviously, choosing a condition that both sides can agree to is going to be the sticking point here, since it'd have to be something that can be objectively measured and not easily gamed, but I have some hope that *something* could be found.
As a strawman, let's say that SW/LN people think that fees will fall as people are incented to move transactions off-chain. Big Blockers think that fees will continue to rise because they either don't think LN will work, or get traction, or that just LN settlements alone are too much for the current blocksize. This creates an opportunity for each side to "bet" on their prediction. There should be some fee price that the SW/LN don't think will be maintained, but the Big Blockers think will be exceeded. Under this proposal you'd do something like:
1. Activate Segwit immediately
2. After 18 months, is the fee size above $X/kB? If so, the block size automatically doubles
3. After 12 more months, is the fee size above $X/kB? If so, the block size doubles
4. After 12 final months, is the fee size above $X/kB? If so, the block size doubles.
So if everything goes according to the SW/LN plan, there is never a hardfork. If SW proves to be insufficient though, then a blocksize increase happens automatically, without people having to update the code they are running again. This helps the Big Blockers trust that the fork will actually happen if it is needed. Ultimately, this particular strawman could end up with 1MB blocks, or as large as 8MB depending on how many of the doublings were triggered.
Again, the schedule I gave above is just a strawman. I don't know how many size increase events would be best, or what factor increase to use, or how far apart the conditional events would be. I just choose some examples that seemed roughly reasonable (with an extra 6 months for the first event to allow time for LN to take root). I also don't know what sort of metric would be best. Fee in BTC? Fee in USD? Mempool size? Average time until a transaction ends up in a block? Something.

Neat. In the meantime, figure out why Hint 4 isn't free yet ;)

This one hung me up for a while. You're not looking for a missing treasure. The keyword that got me moving was in the text. lost ELEMENTS of history.
Hint  You can count the treasures on 1 hand
What's missing is "The Fifth Element" of history.
I must be particularly derpy today, because I *still* don't get it. I was totally on board with "Elements", but I don't see what about the four given suggests what you're looking for. Maybe if they had "earth" "air" "fire" "water" hidden in their words or something.
I was looking on a periodic table (even before the "Atomic Number" non-clue). I was thinking Holy Grail = Hg = Mercury, Patiala Necklace = P N = Phosphorus + Nitrogen, etc. (I'd decided that the presence of "The" meant a two-letter element symbol, and its absence meant two one-letter symbols).
Did the stray capital D mean anything? Since it came at the end of a word, I took it to mean that the answer would be spelled backwards, or that there was some hidden information in the clue that could be read backwards, but I never found anything. I'd actually tried both "Boron" and "Norob" as the answers to bin 3.
@_date: 2013-05-17 01:50:16
now that that's over— if you do log these things. I'm pretty sure that I'd tried "CYPRUS" (and then "CYPRES") quite some time before I finally got around to trying it *again*.
Similarly, at one point I went back a few clues, and then couldn't get "PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES" to be accepted, even though I already had past that chest before.
It's quite possible, even likely, that I'd mistyped or had an extra untrimmed space or something, but if you have the logs available, you might want to check that everything was indeed working the whole time.
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:32:07
You're overthinking it.
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:20:07
My guess is that each number block corresponds to a word. 3-6 is a good length for words.
I'd also guess that the digits in each number index into a source text somehow. I'd guess that source is the lyrics to "Strange Currencies", but I can't find any indexing scheme that produces a useful plaintext.
@_date: 2013-05-11 05:18:22
That one was just the keypart that you'd just been given.

chrome stable (26) / mac.
probably a typo on my end or something. I can't repro it, and reloading the page "fixed" it (or retyping fixed it, but I could swear I tried it)
One thing that made this scary at the time was that there's no way forward if you've already solved a chest without reentering its answer. I hoped that a reload would take me to the last chest I was on, but I think solving an earlier chest again reset my cookie's position.

It would be neat if those stats were visible in the site as well. It'd be fun to have a graph of how far behind I am (and be able to know things like I'm 15% slower on this puzzle, but 5% faster on that puzzle than average).

Anyone figure out what "Wings" was?

I've heard "Mikes" as in micros.
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:25:59
One possible indexing scheme (that I can't make work), would be that each digit is the number of steps from the previous letter. So that leading double zero could just mean that the word starts with a doubled letter that matches the last letter of the previous word. So something like "eerie" or "llama".
That said, I think I'm barking up the wrong tree.
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:04:18
Okay, now that I've looked at the rest of the puzzle, the capital letters make sense.

the format, as given in one of the hints, is always two decimal places.
@_date: 2013-09-24 19:07:34
One thing I'd like to see standardized is a way to denote the value of a payment in alternate currencies if applicable. So if I buy something priced in dollars, I have a computer-readable record of what the exchange rate was at the time of the transaction. This would be *super*-helpful for calculating cap gains/losses for those of us that want to keep tight track of such things.
Of course, any such proposal would have to be flexible enough to handle mixed transactions (something similar to a Casascius coin could have part of its value as pure BTC/LTC/whatever and some of its value in fiat/metal/whatever), but having this available would really help accounting and adoption by those for whom accounting is a priority.

It *is* part of the protocol. It has to be because the breakdown is typically going to come from the seller. If I buy something through BitPay, they're the ones that are going to be dictating the exchange rate for the transaction. It's not something I can do in a custom wallet.
