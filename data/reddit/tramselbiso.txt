It depends which stocks vs which crypto.
The only difference between stocks vs crypto is that ownership of stocks is denoted throug a centralised registry that keeps hold of your identity whereas with crypto it is through cryptography. Based on this, there is no reason to believe one is safer than the other. It depends on the underlying asset.

Some crypto do pay dividends (e.g. Neo). There is no reason why a cryptoasset cannot pay a dividend.

Government cannot be destroyed. Government is simply whatever entity has the most power in a society. Hence in a power vacuum caused by deregulation etc some entity will simply outcompete others to become the government. The question is should that government work on behalf of the people via a ballot box (democracy) or on behalf of shareholders (plutocracy) or on behalf of a family (monarchy) or a small group or people (oligarchy). Libertarianism or anarcho-capitalism is impossible because they create enough of a power vacuum to incentivize people to grab power.

The fiat you use to buy BTC has value because there is demand from people for it. The same applies with USDT. USDT has value because there is demand. It is no different. It doesn't matter if there is a high supply of USD or USDT due to quantitive easing. That just increases the supply and lower the value of USD or USDT. Yes USD and USDT are created from thin air, but just about all currencies are, not just USD and USDT. Something being created out of thin air doesn't mean it is worthless. This is why USD, USDT, and even BTC have value.

I agree that there needs to be a government, but the capitalists are the ones who want either small government or no government (anarcho-capitalism). Socialists acknowledge that there must be a government and that government should serve society.
The huge amount of privatisation in the past three decades has led to the private sector controlling government. This is why there was a bailout during the GFC and why bitcoin was created in response to obvious abuse of power by bankers who became powerful because of policies designed to favour capital and capitalists. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:51:19
The operation of a bank can be programmed into the ethereum blockchain, so loans from multiple lenders will be pooled and borrowers will have credit ratings based on evidence of creditworthiness, which can be verified on the blockchain rather than with the traditional system where documents are forged thereby causing the GFC.
Because a bank decentralized autonomous organisation does not pay employees and executives who are clearly overpaid then the spread between interest paid to lenders and interest charged to borrowers will be lower, meaning interest rates are lower for borrowers and returns to lenders will be higher.

It depends on how things pan out in the future. If lightning network works well, it becomes more useful as a medium of exchange. Otherwise perhaps it will function like gold, i.e. people hold it because they expect it to hold value and not be ravaged by inflation (since there is a 21 million BTC limit).
If BTC does become a very fast and effective currency, its volatility is not a problem because it may completely replace fiat. Bitcoin being a global currency will help its adoption. Imagine travelling to, say, China and not needing to convert USD to Yuan. You just use your BTC. 
If there is complete adoption of BTC worldwide, items will be priced in BTC. For example, one bottle of almond milk in a shop may be priced as 12k satoshi. The BTC you hold will not be volatile because 12k satoshi is always 12k satoshi. If BTC becomes the reference currency then USD will be seem volatile compared to BTC. It's all relative.

This is not true. Holding assets denominated in a variety of different currencies is less speculative than holding assets all in one currency. For example, suppose I held all my assets in USD. That would be far more risky (and speculative) than if I held all assets denominated half in USD and half, say, in euro. This is because the USD may depreciate against the euro.

The same thing as in the traditional system except it will be automated or coded on the ethereum network. When someone borrows money from this decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), they will provide some sort of collateral, e.g. 100 ETH. If they default, the DAO will take the 100 ETH. Then there will be on a blockchain a reduced credit rating for this borrower.
Basically in the traditional system, there is an arrangement between the borrower and lender, there is a contract that is drafted, and humans verify and execute the contract. However, in the future, what I predict is that, rather than have a paper contract between borrower and lender, the contract is coded into the etherum network (or some other smart contract network) and rather than have lawyers and courts verify and execute the contract, miners will perform this role.

Well I think he is a nationalist but there are factions. There is a small government faction and a big government faction, and more nationalism cannot work with smaller government. In order to have a nation you need a government. Nationalism is pretty much socialism given that a nation and a society are pretty much the same things, that is, a group of people.
The more I do things online and with crypto the more I see nations as irrelevant and the more I see them as completely artificial constructs. When online, nations mean nothing. Nations are nothing more than invisible lines drawn on a map by powerful people, and people only believe in the sacredness of these invisible lines because of propaganda by big government.

It's difficult to know if one caused the other given the stock market has always been going up after the GFC due to money printing. Interestingly money printing is why bitcoin was created in the first place. 
Nevertheless, my opinion is that Trump is a nationalist so he supports more government whereas I see bitcoin as anti-government. Bitcoin is a global currency without borders. Bitcoin doesn't care who you are or what your nationality is whereas traditional finance requires your identity and nationality. The traditional finance system operates via banks and government whereas bitcoin and the internet in general has made nations obsolete. My hope is that bitcoin and the internet in general can do away with countries and government and nations and nationalism as smaller government and more free trade has always made people better off. The more people use bitcoin the less power governments and banks have making governments and therefore nations less powerful and obsolete over the long term, which goes against nationalism, which goes against Trump.

If a business has a liability in USD, the price of that liability in USD can change due to changes in foreign exchange. For example, one liability may be hiring workers and paying them in USD. If the USD depreciates against the euro, those workers travel to Europe to get jobs thereby decreasing the supply of labor in the US. Exposure to euro partially hedges against this.
The bottom line is that every business has different liabilities, costs, risk appetites, and therefore have different foreign exchange risk management policies. They don't all want to convert back to local currency.

What do you mean by "hard capital" and why is it relevant? BCC was an overvalued asset. The market corrected BCC's value to its intrinsic value. If USDT is not backed by USD, the market will simply correct USDT's value and it will fall similar to how BCC's value fell. It is simply asset prices changes. I don't see how "hard capital" is of any relevance unless there is something I'm not aware of.

Capitalist do mooch off workers. I would know because I am one. I don't work  very hard but I control capital and live off dividends. I was able to accumulate all this capital because I am an antinatalist ie I believe humanity is fundamentally depraved and oppressive  so I have no children and I never married so I don't need to buy much and so I am able to save up a lot by living a minimalist lifestyle. So it's not true that rich capitalists work hard and poor workers don't. The poor workers may have a family and children and work to earn enough just to feed the children.

As a result, I had little use for my income other than investing while my peers were drowning in debt because of obligations. I was also too lazy to date, marry, and have children. According to Time Magazine, one child costs about $1.1 million. This means I was able to save up a lot. It doesn't mean I worked hard for it.

Gold is a good safe haven, but there are circumstances when you're rather use crypto rather than gold. For example, suppose a dictator suddenly gained power in your country and started oppressing people and you needed to flee. You run to the nearest boat intending to flee to a safe place like New Zealand. You have your gold in your pocket. Then some random thug on the boat feels you up, finds your gold, and robs you. Now imagine the exact same scenario except rather than having wealth in physical gold you have wealth in a diversified portfolio of high quality crypto e.g. BTC, LTC, and DOGE, and this is all protected by a BIP39 15-word mnemonic that you have memorized. Then you run to this boat that is heading to New Zealand and then the thug feels you up, finds nothing on you, and moves on to the next guy. Then when you get to New Zealand, you convert a portion of your crypto into NZ dollars to buy some bread and rent a place to stay for the night.

I would go even further than your advice to not go into debt to buy crypto. Try as hard as you can to never ever go into debt at all. If you must hold a credit card, pay off any debt immediately. Only buy a house with cash. Don't get a mortgage. Trust me. The risk is not worth it. If you break the word "mortgage" up, the prefix "mort-" means "death" and the affix "-gage" means "grip" or "contract" so a mortgage is a "death contract" or a "death grip."
Ask yourself what is the reason why banks lend money to borrowers so that the borrowers invest in something rather than the bank invest in it directly themselves?

Yes, I see many people doubt me, which is understandable because I think bankers have completely brainwashed people into thinking debt is good. In theory if you borrow at a low rate and then invest and get a return higher than the cost of borrowing, you come out ahead, but so much has to go right. You are assuming your investment goes up enough and the interest rate stays low enough. Everything has to go right in the future and the future is uncertain. Interest rates change, asset prices change, and you may lose your job. I've been in debt before it is literally slavery. 
In the days of the pharaohs in Ancient Egypt, the slaves who built the pyramids had two choices: (1) work hard by pushing that heavy stone and suffer from moderate pain or (2) get whipped for not working and suffer from significant pain. Because the pain from (1) is less than the pain from (2), the slave was coerced into working.
A modern wage slave with a mortgage has two choices: (1) work to pay of the debt and suffer from moderate pain or (2) not pay mandatory monthly mortgage repayments and be subject to punative interest rates or even having the bank force sell the house with transaction costs dumped on you. Because the pain from (1) is less than the pain from (2), the wage slave is coerced into working.
Slavery has not been abolished. It has evolved. The jobs that slaves perform today at more intellectually advanced therefore requiring far more sophisticated slavery techniques, and modern slavery today is built upon debt.
The mortgage or debt in general are the whips of today that compel people to a life of slavery. I strongly recommend to people to try to live a life without any debt. There will be circumstances when you must go into debt, but pay it off straight away, and if you absolutely must go into debt then keep it low. 
Aim instead to stay debt free, diversify your investments, and live off 4% of your net worth (as per [the 4% rule]( Follow the 4% rule as fast as possible even if you have not retired yet. This is what you do to become a free man in today's unfree world.

Bitcoin will become like gold, a store of wealth, with lightning and other second layer solutions being the new fiat, but it will all settle on the blockchain similar to a gold standard. This will usher in a new era of monetary stability since currency will be pegged to something of fixed supply (bitcoin) thereby destroying the boom bust cycle that was a product of excessive money printing.

Arguing that social structures should endeavour to mitigate negative consequences for losers is pretty much the argument for socialism, and I am sure he and his supporters do not advocate for socialism.
Peterson believes socialism is driven by resentment and says the following about Marxism:
“There is the dark side of it, which means everyone who has more than you got it by stealing it from you. And that really appeals to the Cain-like element of the human spirit. Everyone who has more than me got it in a manner that was corrupt and that justifies not only my envy but my actions to level the field so to speak, and to look virtuous while doing it. There is a tremendous philosophy of resentment that I think is driven now by a very pathological anti-human ethos.”
Going back to incels, incels are the losers of the sexual free market. Incel rage is also driven by resentment. How is it consistent then that Peterson seeks to mitigate negative consequences for incels? There are many articles that quite Peterson as against socialism and "actions to level the field" yet he supports incels with enforced monogamy.

I have just subscribed and I'm looking forward to more videos. Another crypto travel vlog I like is the bitcoin family.
Now that there is blood on the streets I am heavily dollar cost averaging onto bitcoin. In a few more years I expect  a massive pump and I will become super rich. Then I will travel and spend bitcoin directly because bitcoin to bitcoin transactions have lower fees than bitcoin to fiat conversions. 
Many people claim that bitcoin is useless because no one accepts it. However, when bitcoin pumps heavily, those who made massive gains will want to spend their bitcoin to realize their gains. Once they do they will seek to spend bitcoin rather than converting to fiat due to cost. This demand will result in supply by merchant to accept bitcoin. The more merchants that accept bitcoin the more demand there will be thereby creating a virtuous cycle.

Renting gives you complete flexibility and frees up your money so you can buy something that really makes you a lot more money, such as bitcoin.
Suppose you buy a small house for $100k. It will probably go up 10% per year (optimistic assumption) so it will appreciate and you make $10k. Had that $100k been in bitcoin then based on historical performance bitcoin doubles every year (100% returns annual, which is a highly conservative estimate). You make $100k per year. By having your cash in property rather than bitcoin you lose 90k per year.

Personally I think these movements are simply anti-women, another hate group that perpetuates sexism and hatred of women. These movements are growing rapidly, especially following the Donald Trump "grab them by the pussy" incident when harassment of women gained legitimacy. All the efforts made under feminism to make society safe for our daughters is being torn down. This is why I don't want to have any children. It is very likely that if I have a daughter she will be sexually harassed by a manospherean conservative at school, so it is better to be childfree.

I already know about the Chinese economy and that BTC is an asset, as is USD. How are you sure deflation will increase inequality? Yes, I own BTC. If I wanted to buy right now, I use fiat. However, what I don't spend, I invest, and I invest in BTC as well as other investments.
Even though BTC exists, I still spend money using fiat. Just because BTC is deflationary (as is other investments) it doesn't mean I hold on to everything. I still need to spend on e.g. food. Even if fiat didn't exist and I got paid in BTC, I would simply spend a portion of my BTC. 
Let's say for example I currently get $1000 per week from my employer. I put $500 into BTC for investment and the rest I spend. Now suppose there is not such thing as fiat. Instead you get paid in BTC. You get $1000 per week in BTC. You leave $500 in BTC for investment and you spend $500 worth of BTC on what you need. Nothing changes when you replace the fiat currency (an inflationary asset) into BTC (a deflationary asset). People will still spend and invest.
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:01:01
I buy and hold BTC because I expect its price to be far higher in the future and I imagine many others are doing the same as well.

I mistakenly replied to you, but my point is that people don't avoid spending BTC just because it is deflationary and goes up in value. If that were the case, why do people spend fiat now when they could simply convert it to BTC?

Have a look at small cap stocks and compare them to large cap stocks. Large cap stocks have lower volatility. This is due to the fact that when an asset has a small market cap, it has a low base. For example, suppose an assets has a market cap of $100. Then if you add $5 then the market cap increases 5%. However, if the market cap is $1000 and then you add $5 then this is a 0.5% increase. The same amount of money coming in gives a lower percentage market cap increase for the asset with higher market cap.
What data is there to suggest that bitcoin will increase in market cap? In 2013 bitcoin was $100. Now it is $8000. Of course, past performance is not a guarantee of future performance, but we are talking about data or figures here.

You can't say lower interest rates are better than higher interest rates. There are winners and losers. If interest rates rise then those with debts suffer but those who save earn more interest. There is nothing wrong with higher interest rates.
Having inflation eat away your debt is not helpful as people just go into more and more debt expecting interest rates to stay low. If it does not they are in big trouble. Having higher interest rates will force people to be more careful with debt and to take on what they can afford.

Countries and companies will not necessarily suffer if interest rates are higher. Low interest rates encourage more people to borrow money, which increases asset prices, leading to higher rents and higher prices of everything. Those who win are those who hold lots of assets. Those who lose are those who face higher cost of living. This is the primary reason why wealth inequality is rising so fast. Interest rates should simply be allowed to adjust according to supply and demand. This is what is best for the economy.

Look at all the destruction we have caused to the earth, the animals, and the environment. Noah delivered the first flood. The next flood will be a mushroom cloud.

I need to exist in order to encourage others not to breed. Hopefully I have some impact on the world. By going on a birthstrike, not only are you helping the world and helping humanity, but you are also helping yourself financially as one child will end up costing you about $1.1 million (according to Time Magazine). Simply by never having children and putting whatever money you would have spent on children into bitcoin, you are pretty much guaranteeing yourself a comfortable life with lots of money and early retirement. Nature rewards those who protect her.

Many people identify with what they invest in similar to how they identify with political ideologies so an attack on anything you identify  is seen as a personal attack. It is not logical but that is how most people are.

Why would it matter if the government made bitcoin? Bitcoin is simply an idea. Furthermore, bitcoin threatens the control governments have, so why would the government willingly cede control?

Exactly. What a brilliant currency.

I made that gesture to a lady yesterday. She slapped me on the face. I figure she's a litecoin lady.

I personally think it is wrong to not allow someone in due to what country they are from or what race they are. For example, many people argue that Africans are more likely to commit crime and therefore governments should ban Africans from entering a country, but those who commit crime may be more likely to be young and there may be more young Africans. There may be confounding variables. We know for example that men are overrepresented in crime stats but that doesn't mean we demonize men or don't let men into the country.
Conservatives nowadays seem to be trying to incite racial hatred, sexism, and other division  which can lead to race riots, gangs with machetes hacking each other, Nazis on the streets, etc. Conservatives have been using racism and sexism to divide us. Just today a young schoolgirl told me that she was grabbed by the pussy. I spoke to the girl's parents and told them to do something about this, maybe tell the school administrators. She seems afraid to do anything thinking this was normal male behaviour, which is quite sad because Donald Trump and conservarives have normalized toxic manospherean behavior that involves disrespecting women. Now schoolboys are emulating the behaviour thinking it is normal to treat women with disrespect because they hear the President disrespecting women and so it becomes normal behavior, and all of this behavior is encouraged online by conservative manosphereans who believe that women should have no rights. They truly belive that women are childlike and cannot properly reason and so a man needs to take control and own her and control her. Some of them (scuh as Roosh Velizadeh) belive that on private property women should be allowed to be raped. 
This is the world we will live in with the conservatives have their way. There will be race riots and murders and killings. Women will be raped on the streets and disrespected everywhere. It worries me because many non-whites and women vote for conservatives. I need to remind them just how much their safety and welfare is under threat if they do so.

Something that is illogical from Peterson is his argument that hierarchy is natural. However he supports incels who are the losers in the hierarchy, and Peterson says that there should be enforced monogamy to allow incels to have wives, which goes against natural hierarchy. If he truly believed in natural hierarchy then he would let the women chose which men they want to go with and also have polygamy and promiscuity and free sex ie a deregulated sexual marketplace and let natural hierarchy emerge rather than go against natural hierarchy with enforced monogamy.

That kind of music should definitely be banned.

Whether or not Peterson fits this label, I have issues with his defence of the incels and the TRP MGTOW manosphereans.
Many of these conservatives believe that it's okay to use aggressive techniques to undermine women in order to have sex with them (e.g. using dread game and negging). Whenever I speak to conservatives and tell them that it is important to treat women with respect and dignity, they always criticise me and tell me that I am a hypocrite for treating women better than men, and they claim I am a hypocrite for not supporting equality. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity regardless of gender. I fear that as conservative values spread, women around the world will be victims of hate. Significant progress has been made in educating women and making them independent and self-reliant, but now I am seeing this progress being set back as conservatives seek to restore women's positions as sexual playthings and that women are not entitled to their own autonomy.

I find that those on the right are selective when they talk about what is PC eg if they say something such as what TRP r/MGTOW  manosphereans say eg "women should be in the kitchen and not work but should serve the man" then they will claim that anyone who is offended is PC but if someone were to talk about eg r/antinatalism then those on the right usually get go offended by this they will censor you rather than engage in any rational or logical discussion.

I think the reason is because Peterson supports incels and wants "enforced monogamy" so that incels can have wives, and incels have been controversial as many have gone on shooting rampages and have mowed down women in vans eg Elliot Rodgers and Alex Minassian.
