People who browse are not average redditors.

I got this as well, I'd imagine it's a mass mailing to anyone who has posted on First tipoff, claiming "Bitcoin mania" was the cause of Reddit's downtime last week. What an idiot.

How much is the consensus of what someone would need to invest today to be "rich" in the future? What kind of % gain are you guys expecting in the next 5-10 years? I thought we are long past the early adopter stage, like back at $20/BTC

Care to take a guess what you think bitcoins will cost in 1 - 5 years?

Thanks for providing a specific number, even if it's only a guess.
I will consider transferring some funds to an exchange so I have them ready, but probably hold off buying for a bit.

Just installed 50Miner on my PC to give it a quick go
On max power I can get about 250 MH/s but started getting graphical glitches on my screen almost immediately. At half power it runs at about 180 MH/s and started getting glitchy after a few minutes which is worrying. 11 solutions found and I earned $0.0024 in about 5 minute run. At minimum processing it gets like 1 MH/s which is pretty useless.
So it might earn like $0.02/hr, probably not worth risking it.

If it's even a digit better than the websites that pay you 0.00001 BTC per click I'd be happy
