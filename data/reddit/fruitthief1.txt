Dude, people like this guy insert themselves into any position that is open. Like the head of the DEA does not actually know anything about the DEA and what it does. Or head of the FDA knows nothing about food or drugs other than they take it; with a bit of bribe. 
These people are incompetent and give zero fucks a out their job. They’re their to take money from lobbyist. The whole government, or most of it, is nothing more than a money making scheme for the people involved. We temporarily fixed the recession by creating more government employees.

It will become more stable as the price rise. Its not there yet but you can imgagine a 300 billion market cap is harder to move than a 70 billion market cap. 700 billion market cap and you wont even feel a 100 usd price swing. Its volatile because its still young snd growing, once it mature it will be more suitable for everyday transaction.
You can see if you look, a lot of people are working on it to improve it every day/fork/year. It is only getting better. Its like a pawn on a chessboard, it can only move forward snd never back capability wise.

You can download a mobile wallet on your phone. I like Breadwallet. Its easy to use and secure. Easy to spend.
If you want more security buy a trezor or a l ledgerwallet. Your phone and computer are vulnerable to malware, the wallets mentioned previously can give you peace of mind. Should you want to cash out your coins at a rate &gt;10k per day, get a bitpay card or cards like it. Just send your coins to card and you have cash.

There is an option to set it to offline on the top left. There should be an option to set it to online there too. 
It takes days for armory to download the blockchain, you will not see your funds until it has downloaded and fully synced with the btc network. 
I cant remember how many words there are in an armory seed but I am guessing it is 24. A seed is a 12 to 24 word ( depend on which wallet you use ) that will allow you to restore your wallet should you forget your password or your hard drive crashes or stolen or blown up by aliens from moro a planet on the 3rd ring of saturn. Whatever the cause as long as you have your seed, you can download your wallet again anywhere that is possible and restore your wallet to its former glory and a new password of your choice. If someone else get access to your 12 to 24 word seed, they can restore your wallet and take your shit.
Has your armory finished downloading the blockchain?

Everytime a country tries to turn away from the US, which the saudis are doing, freedom and democracy gets rained down on them. Them purchasing Russian military equipment is very telling.
Their war in yemen shows the world that they are ineffective in modern warfare. They are located in a place on earth that is more volatile than bitcoin. They ate surrpunded by enemies including Iran, Syria, Isral, et al, and the war in Yemen have shown to the world that they cannot fight a war. Their soldiers ate getting absolutely slaughtered by Yemenese guerilla fighters. They have the best equipment money can buy but are still getting wtfpwned by guys in rags and sandals.

@_date: 2017-10-28 22:58:02
Ok. I see your problem. Your armory is downloading the blockchain thats why you see it as offline. 
When you start armory, you will see it downloading the blockchain. Leave it alone and let it download. You’re just exploring armory before it finishes downloading.
Transaction ID is given to every transaction that is made. You can use this to find out all the detail about the transaction but more importantly, it act as evidence as to whether or not a transaction actually took place. If you sent me 1 btc and I said no you didnt, you can pull up the transaction from the blockchain and say yes you did and there it is you lying, scamming sack of shit. You can use blockchain.info to do that. Just paste transaction ID into search bar there. You can find transaction ID in the transaction details on coinbase.
