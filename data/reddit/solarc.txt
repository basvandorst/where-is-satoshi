The solution is a basic concept called [Database Transactions]( Basically, the first transaction locks the row until it finishes working on it, while the following transactions wait or return with an error.

It's just another altcoin, there's dozens of them so replace is kind of a big word, what makes you think it could replace Bitcoin?

If you hover the green button in your last link it says "Value at time of transaction", so I imagine the difference is because multibit is using the current rate.
Either way, you have 0.0001 BTC, whatever the conversion to USD is.

No bitcoin is lost unless you lose the keys. If you want to transfer 0.175645, you'll transfer exactly 0.175645 (plus fees).

The problem with that is that Bitcoin transfers are irreversible, while Paypal's can be reversed at request of the buyer. So it becomes a risk for the seller.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:29:19


Sounds like an electrum seed. Download [electrum]( install it and when you open it the first time choose *Restore an existing wallet from its seed* and use your word sequence.
If you do get them back, get a new wallet and transfer your coins.

They keep the users' balance in a database, the coins are probably bundled together with that of their other users in a number of wallets. This is what happens if you handle 2 orders at the same time without checking for race conditions:
* Order 1 checks the balance from the database: 100
* Order 2 checks the balance from the database: 100
* Order 1 withdraws 100 coins to your wallet: 100 - 100 = 0
* Order 2 withdraws 0.001 coins to your wallet: 100 - 0.001 = 99.999
* Order 1 saves the balance back on the database: 0
* Order 2 saves the balance back on the database: 99.999
Final balance in your account: 99.999
Amount withdrawn: 100.001

Read through the [source]( [code]( looks like accounts are a way to group wallets (say your personal account and your bussiness account for example).
Also, the menu option will enable when the [seed version is greater than 4]( (4 being the current version) I imagine it's going seeds are going to be migrated to a newer version later and the menu will enable.
@_date: 2014-01-21 14:42:58
I read more about it, it seems to focus on faster block confirmations. I like that people experiment with altcoins, that way they can try different combinations of settings that can better the experience, but it seems more feasible for bitcoin to adapt to what these coins find than for the other coins to beat it.
If lower difficulty and lower amount of blocks for adjusting it are really such a great idea as Worldcoin proposes, Bitcoin could adapt to it.

That's interesting. What are the actual downsides of using bitcoins? Only the volatility comes to mind and that problem is already fixed with stuff like bitpay.

Is this for a speaker? then shorten the text. If it's not for the audience, don't let them see it. They'll just lose focus on the speaker to try to read it.

At least it should give some explanation to them, to register so they can send BTC. Or go a step up and show the BTC address so they can transfer directly :)
@_date: 2013-07-22 02:42:51
The most simple way is to use a service like bitpay, they take in the coins and deposit dollars in your bank account. The highlight is that the prices are converted from dollars at the moment, so you don't suffer from bitcoin's volatility.
You can also see the [wiki]( for ways to do it yourself, basically you pregenerate addresses (always use a new one for each transaction so you are sure who send it) and use a [notify service]( that calls a url on your site when a transaction has been confirmed.

@_date: 2013-11-16 04:16:15
As I understand it, each miner implements whatever they want, then process the blocks and sends it for verification. If the rest implement the same protocol then they'll validate it, if not, then they'll discard it. So only what the majority (&gt;50%) uses will be valid. You don't want your blocks to get discarded so you implement the valid algorithm. Eventually all of them get into it if they want to generate valid blocks.
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:22:24
You could use it as a proxy to anonymize which wallet is sending money to which wallet.
Maybe not public, but among a trusted group of people, it could work.
@_date: 2013-07-19 17:50:31
Well transactions are public anyway, so as long as there's nothing that ties an address to yourself, that's not a problem. The real threat is if someone had access to your PC and copied your wallet and/or used a keylogger to get your passwords, so they could steal your bitcoins. But that threat exists independently of the NSA thing.
As long as you use measures to protect your pc (don't install software from suspicious places, update your software to prevent exploits, etc), that's avoidable.
@_date: 2013-07-14 14:20:42

Less processing power per miner would mean a lower difficulty, which means solving faster. Bitcoin wouldn't be affected at all.

The hash rate adjusts automatically through the difficulty. If it gets too slow, the difficulty drops so it becomes easier to get a valid block, if it's too fast it increases.
[There was one case]( when a new version of the software was incompatible and the blockchain split in two, they had to downgrade to make the one by the old version the one true chain.
