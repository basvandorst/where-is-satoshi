BitGo is a good service but everyone here will downvote  because I didn't praise an expensive Trezor.

So you could transfer Bitcoin to Altcoin and back? Or am I misunderstanding? How is the exchange rate determined?

After reading this, I checked my two nodes at FTPIt (One west coast and one east coast). One was suspended and the other wasn't. No word back from support but I suspect the same thing. Their TOS is the same, prohibits mining, but doesn't specifically prohibit running a node. Been running these for a good 6 months now. Wonder how long its been suspended (Thanks for telling me!!).

I have been using BitGo for awhile now. I have not had any issues at all and have never seen any reports of stolen coins or other issues.

I use a credit card to buy everything then pay it off at the end of the month.  Will your system be able to do the same thing with credit card purchases?

Anyone else use Bitcoin? I put a few Bitcoins in there and so far I like it. Anyone see any downsides to this over cold storage when I'm not storing tons of Bitcoin?
BTW, I did manage to figure out their offline recovery tool.

Are there any easy tutorials to install a stats script on an Ubuntu VPS? Have had a full node running for awhile, but dont know how to view stats like in the comments here.

I just signed up and got Level 1 verified. I will start with $50/paycheck to see how it goes.
