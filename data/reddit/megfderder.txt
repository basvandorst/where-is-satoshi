Every transaction may be accompanied by an optional fee, usually a few pennies. You set the size of this fee. The bigger the fee, the faster it will be included in ledger. You added a fee of 0 to your transaction. Most nodes choose to ignore transactions which pay no fees, and most miners do not include them in the blocks they mine. 
Tl;DNR: Basically, you asked for your tranaction to be sent for free and everyone ignored you. Your coins are still in the sending address safe and sound.
Fix: Zap the zero fee transaction and resend it with a fee.

This sounds perfect. I've written a handful of moderately popular Wordpress plugins. I'll take a look at the code, thanks.

Whales manipulate the price, but no one can manipulate the underlying machinery unless we all agree to. Bernake could replace the dollar with oak leaves tomorrow.

6 Chinese miners do not 95% make, brother.

6 Chinese miners are, at worst, an improvemnt over the 5 Jew bankers

About 80-85% usually.

I'm talking about altering the fundamentals of the protocol which requires a 95% consensus. I think you are talking about a Chinese 51% attack on the blockchain which would cripple confidence in bitcoin and basically trash their massive investment. It’s not in their self interest to do that so I don't worry that they will.

If you hard fork the dollar they put you in jail.

A $1,000 rig will mine .02 bitcoins a day atm, not counting electricity. If you can't afford a 100 GB hard drive, nontrivial mining hardware might be out of your reach friend. That being said, no, you don't need a copy of the blockchain to mine if you join a pool.

75 whatever. You fucking tutletle.

Panic and then kill yourself. Not sure if that's the order to do it in though probably it is. 
Hope you didn't have much in there, sounds like it's in hell with Satoshi and all the other lost coins.

That's the only world where it is possible.
