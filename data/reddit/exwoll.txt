If the code itself forks from bitcoin, it would become The bitcoin, there is no point there to address, since everyone would have the same amount of them as the old chain. 
Now in case that it's some new coin, it should be really really really very good and in some way beat the shit out of BTC and deem it obsolete in all ways in order for people to leave an established, and gradually shrinking in supply asset, for some new coin with a short blockchain, lower value and uncertain future. We already have coins that beat BTC in a lot of ways, but there are still no queues of people wanting to sell their BTC to jump into them!
Would be the same case as gold (with so many other options that outperform it in every single way) or some "solid" equities being out there for ages even when a lot of new and better companies pop out every other year.
I never wrote that BTC will remain  doubt it will keep that place for the next year or two, but Berckshire isnt the  company either (or, 2 o r 5) and it costs almost 300kUSD/share.
Those 1000 people will have that BTC as precious stones and use them to settle trades efficiently with very big quantities for the years to come, unless something really big happens that would kill the coin and make it obsolete in one of its main attributes.
ps. All my opinion of course. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:49:31
Really cant understand why people dont take chances. I first heard of bitcoin when it was 400 a year ago, tought about buying one but went for a new gpu instead. Then it soared to 1k and I was like WTF, isolated myself for a couple of days to research and was just blown away by the potential. 
It will easily cost 1B+ USD in 100 years. Shame none of my friends told me about this back in 2010 -.-

Scarcity is the main promoter of value in the world. Couple that with security, liquidity, practicality and programmability and its a self sustainable circle. 
As long as is it scarce, it will grow in price, as long as it grows in price, it will be attractive for miners, as long as miners are in, the security of the transactions and the blockchain rises, which attracts more value from less secure instruments (cash, deposits, derivatives, real estate (depending on location)), which rises the demand, and the cycle repeats (and I´m not talking about traders, but you can put them into the equation and it will just accelerate the thing).
Of course it will not hold all the capital in the world, but even taking in count the other cryptos, the available supply from the physical world is really big (and growing every day thanks to the fractional reserve system and the ongoing devaluation of the old "paper" currencies), and "real" instruments are very scarce (physical gold and other precious metal and elements, art, etc and lack the liquidity/practicality that bitcoin and other cryptos have).
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:56:59
Did you even read what i wrote?. I repeat that I doubt BTC will be the  The values comes from belief. Nothig else. 
Gold is valuable because some folks think shiny yellow metals for some reason are nice and worth the high price (personally I hate the color and the physical metal lol), Diamonds arent even scarce but people still pays huge sums for a piece of worthless glass, cash is just a piece of paper with some sogns on it that are issued with no rule whatsoever to control it, and people give their lifes for it, cars cost thousands above their production costs just because they are shinny and well marketed, etc.
Masses are irrational.
Ps. Also there is the USD and other currencies devaluation factor. People know that holding USD in the long term is bad for their pockets. So the value of btc could be more a sign of the devaluation of the dollar.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:29:42
There where hundereds of those "colored coins" back then, all using different approaches or using the sanme btc code with something better. How many of them are still around?
Like I said you could make a 2k usd lambo copy with superior stats, but people would still buy the original. You have people buying apple computers instead of superior pcs, etc. 
"Time and usage", sure, and miners, and a lot of energy, and investing, etc. I doubt its doable for anyone in the short timeframe.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:35:41
Thats irresponsible behavior. While the price going up is a certainty, it will go through a lot of up and downs through the years. Even then, creditors will want their money back a lot sooner than 100 years, so it´s a very bad idea for anything but for an expansion of an ongoing business with a 100% certainty of getting the funds pack quick to payback the banks (I´m personally against credit).
But I´m mining and getting what I can without compromising my financial future.

You can also create your own paper.money, and I dont see the dollar falling because you made your own. Why would people crash btc because of another coin? They can all exist along. And no one is faking anything, as long as the 21M limit is in place it will hold its value.

@_date: 2017-08-04 14:28:02
Im mostly talking about the comments, the picture is specifically making fun of satoshis vision comparing it to a religion and ridiculizing the ones that agree with it. 
Technology can change,a vision and an idea not, they just turn into other visions and ideas. And in this case what happened is the same that happens with anything that tries to go against the system: the system destroys the originators, absorbs the idea and reshape it for her needs. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:32:59
Its also fun that you mentioned Jesus. Thats a good example of what happens to the ones going against the system. They get destroyed, their ideas twisted and reused in favor of the system and their bodies used as a hanging trophy.
P.s. I dont believe in gods nor religion, but I respect Jesus as man, and sadly Satoshi probably followed his steps to the grave. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:20:52
Do you see any posters worshiping him? Most people just mention him with the deserved respect he deserves for daring to go against The pyramid and probably paying for that with his life. 
When someone "invokes" "satoshis vision" he's talking about that specifically to add weight to their statments quoting the one who introduced the technology and the idea. A thing that many don't share and only care about their own little private interests, which is and has been flawlessly used against the community. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:37:03
It is even possible to waive your right? I mean since when can an agreement negate that?
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:10:48
Ill bet on that. Specially taking in count the 30+ "suicides" related to bankig in the last years, it seems really possible. Specially taking in count that if the guy was incognito, no one would even dig into weird stuff surrounding his death or even notice something off (supposing he had family and friends, there a lot of smart guys living all alone out there).
And it would take A LOT of work to find something related to this theory for a journalist.

Japan is a US vassal state and also their Keinessian lab rat . If japan gets the mining majority it will be a lot easier for the bank cartel to control  BTC, specially if its a big corp, since tje government and other players gonna have a lot of mechanisms to pressure them (ranging from favors exchange to blackmail).

Actually BTC isnt anonymous at all, the NSA doesnt need to backdoor btc to know if you have BTC. They have all your email with your addresses, they have all your wallets and passwords via Windows 10 and Android and even if dont have yours, they certainly have one of those fro. Your counterparts which immediatly will lead the TXs to your wallet(s).

3. And you have it? The size increase is more tied to bandwidth capacity than to latency, which is the same no matter how much are you trying to deliver. 
Also the problem might only arise in a couple of years, you don´t know what advances we gonna have, since we gonna gradually change to more effective technologies in long distance data transfer.

@_date: 2017-07-03 16:37:41
From Segwit abstract:
**Transmission of signature data becomes optional**. It is needed only if a peer is trying to validate a transaction instead of just checking its existence. This reduces the size of SPV proofs and potentially improves the privacy of SPV clients as they can download more transactions using the same bandwidth.
**Commitment structure**
A new block rule is added which requires a commitment to the wtxid. The wtxid of coinbase transaction is assumed to be 0x0000....0000.
A witness root hash is calculated with all those wtxid as leaves, in a way similar to the hashMerkleRoot in the block header.
The commitment is recorded in a scriptPubKey of the coinbase transaction. It must be at least 38 bytes, with the first 6-byte of 0x6a24aa21a9ed, that is:
   1-byte - OP_RETURN (0x6a)
   1-byte - Push the following 36 bytes (0x24)
   4-byte - Commitment header (0xaa21a9ed)
  32-byte - Commitment hash: Double-SHA256(witness root hash|witness reserved value)
  
  39th byte onwards: Optional data with no consensus meaning
  
and the coinbase's input's witness must consist of a single 32-byte array for the witness reserved value.
If there are more than one scriptPubKey matching the pattern, the one with highest output index is assumed to be the commitment.
If all transactions in a block do not have witness data, **the commitment is optional**.
Any commitments that are not consensus-critical to Bitcoin, such as merge-mining, MUST NOT use the witness reserved value to preserve the ability to do upgrades of the Bitcoin consensus protocol.
The optional data space following the commitment also leaves room for metadata of future softforks, and MUST NOT be used for other purpose.

As I mentioned before, I´m not happy with any of the two, but I have a base idea to make my choice from. It's a free world (at least at this point), and I can make whatever choice I think is the right one. 
Now you seem to somehow not understand what a "conflict of interests" is, and how can it hurt any endeavor. When such thing exists there can´t be equal chances, or total fairness.  Like when you have a small gold mine somewhere in Alaska, but Big Buck Joe comes to town, and has his bro working at the Land Bureau, and suddenly your small gold mine is now property of someone else´s because BB Joe´s Bro was the one writing the commas in the documents. 


Who said something about "tradition"? 
I'm with the fundamental ideas of the project, which have a whole lot of broader interests that to only serve as a visa replacement for big banks. 
" Tradition" lol. It's like if I bought a plane for the obvious reasons, and then someone comes to cut its wings and tell me that it gonna drive well, with the new tires they want to install.
And when I'm just about to tell them to f*ck off, they start blaming me for being such a retrograde idiot who only cares about tradition.

Without miners there is nothing to use for the users lol, they are what makes the system decentralized.

Reputation is a relative concept, it all depends on who youre looking to get your point from. For example - the clintons are quite reputable if you only get your facts from CNN.
I personally dont feel confortable with it, since I think it holds back BTC for the sake of the interests of one side of the lake(in the best case scenario, not going into deep thin-foil stuff), and that a better solution could be achieved if actually **everyones** interest was counted for.
But what can be done? Anarchism isnt pissible in a world where only 0.00001% of the population actually care for the "common good", but at least the blockchain gives some hopes in that direction.
And thanks to Satoshi for that. He probably ended up paying with his life for his contribution to humanity.

Miners are also users, and they have the most benefit from a strong currency, since they receive their incentive on it. Hence the long term stability of it is at line with their interests. 
That's why I will reject any change that takes out miners of the equation. 
I'm completely in favor of less fees or a mechanism that could provide instant transactions with the minimal fee tho, but this can be done without disrupting the blockchain ecosystem in such a way that the long term outcomes turn pretty dark (for the average user, not for the ones making the changes, as always)

Wouldnt say by far, a lot cap already taken by others. 
And thats mostly devs fault because in 2 years they havent managed to solve their corporate greed issues and have taken the development of btc through a rough path just because it goes with their private interests. 
Miners just mine. There are a lot of interests working against Btc, with lots of financial and man power, that benefit from the division, the chaos, uncertainity and ultimate fall of it. Miners are the last people that want to go against the cow that they milk. 
And I would say that the division among devs is a result of the work of these "unknown" actors, that flawlessly executed the "divide and conquer" method. 
Jihan can he the worst human ever, but he needs a strong BtC. Satoshi designed the system in such way that miners greed keeps the machine working. 
Take that away and you will end up with a Visa-like empty profit instrument for banks.

@_date: 2017-07-19 12:05:01
Yup. 
That 80% understand that the 1mb artificial ceiling is damaging the scalability of the coin and acts like a bottleneck that allows some middleman to take prifit by creating private sidechains.
They agreed to give that middleman their profit opportunity in exchange of a strong btc, but cash/abc would be their ultimate goal. 
Btc wasnt designed to have a limit in blocksize, this should advance with bandwitch evolution. 
If the hard fork doesnt happen peacefully, we gonna have real troubles, because at this point the NYC was a really bad deal looking from the blocksize perspective. 
It scares to see how a minority with power slows down the development of btc. 2 years already ffs. -.-

2. Monopolistic corporate move. Thats what corporations do, welcome to capitalism :)
3 and 4. They're idiots, i dont arguue about that

6 and 8. They are 2 power groups fighting for power. i doubt they mentioned the whole picture (screenshots? Videos? Emails? As proof) and I dont believe neither of the sides (bitmain nor blockstreaam)
7. Oh common, I will not pay attention to the blameseeking of the losses of an investor that failed to actively manage his savings, nor had the balls to hold. Thats life with speculation.
9. Indeed they're doing badly with that. But both sides are to blame with this.  
My bottom line is that I'm for on chain solutions, I dont care where they're coming from. In this debate there is a lot of nonbtc interests in play for both sides. The only one that suffers for it isnthe ecosystem.

By e-mail right?. Those are still 3rd party words about what supposedly happened. 
I don´t think that they would ALL make that up. 
What I think is that it´s extremely weird/suspicious that someone as idealistic as him, that gave so much time, effort, and energy into a project he thought gonna change the world, and that who at the time was worried about the incompleteness of his work, asking people to avoid marketing the thing up because it wasn´t ready, just out of the nowhere, decided to shut up all activity, communicate privately with only a couple of selected individuals (instead of publicly saying that in the same way he did when he just entered the scene) and completely stopping his work, while at the same time giving a message to trust the ones that he privately (supposedly) communicated with, and that ended up taking a different path of what he had planned originally.
These are patterns that an idealistic person would not follow, those people fight for their projects till the end, to death if that´s necessary, because their are worth more than their life for them (and I can deduce that Satoshi was this kind of people by how he was committed to BTC, developing, supporting through 24/7 mining, etc). 
*And also I believe that he was a single individual because of the so early release of his work to public, be him a team, they would had kept it in secret till all critical moments would had been thought about and addressed in the code*.
Because of this I have a really firm suspicion that the guy was taken out (first silence period) (killed or arrested probably, or blackmailed with serious threats to family), then the person or organization that did that gained control of his accounts and tried to mitigate that silence while collected all the data that was needed from them.
It is worth to note that this is the common modus operandi of governmental organizations when dealing with cybercrime. Attack, shut off, gain control, turn on, retrieve useful data, shut off again. It´s a scenario that repeats itself every month in the deep web. 
I don´t say that Hearn, Gavin and Greg had anything to do with that, however I really suspect that they certainly know more of what they publicly said, and moved along the agenda out of fear or just personal interest (fabricating all that last private communications so people could trust them and panic wouldn´t break lose).
But the mainstream version is way too simple and fairy-taly to be seriously considered as the truth, taking in count the scale and importance of the things involved in the work of Satoshi, and the interest involved (both private and governmental). .

Basically what the implementation of Segregated Witness does is converting a currency with inherent value, based on the trust that the blockchain provides with the mandatory global "history compilation/verification" - and what gave Bitcoin the ability to become "virtual gold" - into a "virtual fiat" currency that has to depend in the faith users have upon the mechanisms of verification of a couple of centralized agencies.
If it prevails, it will signal the beginning of the fall of BTC as a libertarian global real currency, and the defeat of every single person that believed in it. Greed and ease would had prevailed upon the original principles, and the status quo will win by making us defeat ourselves with our own hand.
BTC gonna be an enemy that resisted external attacks, but that perished to same people it was created to protect.
Once that initial value had been taken away, they will start pushing for the implementation of inflationary measures, then mechanisms of control of "unintended" consequences and finally just surrendering the control to a single entity which will be an easy target of manipulation by the status quo.
Don't let them use your greed and confort to fool you into false dilemmas, there has to be another way, one which address the bottleneck without compromising the original intent of BTC.

1. Miners are the only party directly risking capital to provide life to the system by creating trust in it via the verification of the hash. 
2. They're not the only party with direct financial interest. Every single person that profits from bitcoin and not only uses it as a vehicle to transfer wealth has direct financial interest.
3. Segwit destroys the inherent trust that BTC has because of the mandatory transaction history verification and hence takes the inherent value miners deposited in it.
4. You don't descentralice the market with Segwit, you just give the power to another party and at the same time destroy the value of the coin, converting it from virtual gold to virtual fiat.

The same data. Mining works as a factory where each miner grabs the transactions data and adds them into a block. For that work they receive coins as a prize. 
If the coin doesnt have a price, then there is no incentive to create the blockchain and the whole cryptocurrency dies.
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:47:53
You could replace the last phrase with any of the power groups behind the wanted changes and it would equally apply. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 12:57:42
Oh yeah baby, I like that! Gimme one more time!
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:04:02
Well there are people that believe that segwit is a targeted attack. With the same conviction you do. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:31:07
Keep up tha trolling. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:39:18
With bigger blocks miners can squeeze more transactions into them, gaining more fees per block (gaining with volume not individual amount).
Yes, the incentives gonna get lower, but the price of each unit should compensate for that, also by that point the fees alone should be able to "sustain" their mining taking in count the amount of them that would fit in an "unlimited" block.
I rember that Satoshi himself was talking about 32mb blocks at some point, but didnt placed any limit to it. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:19:41
Yup that's true. 
The choice I see looks like: (a) get fucked at the beginning vs (b) get fucked the rest of the road. 
I'll bet my ass on the 1st one lol
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:28:43
Oh please sir, sorry for the inconvinience, ill surrender to the truth you carry since its the only source in earth!

I dont think he has only 300k. In the early days some people collected way more than that, he could easiily be holding 2x or 3x that sum.
And smart people dont talk about non proved sums of money that the IRS could be interested in ;)
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:54:28
Hope they do that. Because Im pretty sure they will get a lot of cash from it.
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:25:55
Bitcoin is not conjured out of thin air neither. Theres a lot of work involved. With differentiates it from fiat and shortly from Eth with its pos

I'll open the world for you: as long an item can mine effectively there will always be a mr.money bag that can buy a lot of them and try to get everything he can from the market. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:31:27
Its fun because thats what people says about segwit.  Let the forks happen and the strongest survive
@_date: 2017-07-03 11:56:18
Miners only mine, and care about profits, they don't care about politics and need the trust of BTC to earn their money. 
The lies and attacks come from the status quo that systematically erode the trust people has in BTC and try step by step to destroy it (Segwit is the first one).
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:43:33
Same as the Blockstream guys.
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:13:28
Read some BTC books, inform yourself and form an independent opinion instead following blindly.
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:37:40
So, some corps are trying to get btc control from other corps while governments also fight for it, specially the chinesse. Whats new here? 
@_date: 2017-07-03 11:54:09
Segwit is political interest to destroy the trust acting as foundation for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:52:23
"Targeted attack". Thats a quite too strong statment. They have their own vision of the coin (which also happens to be heavily based on the originao whitepaper), they're free to let markets decide which one gonna have more credibility in the long run.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:41:09
I think you didn't understood what did I meant with that question.

You sound like an evangelist pointing the bible to prove god´s existence lol.

No money probably
@_date: 2017-07-03 13:28:20
SegWit gives a L2 accounting system that doesn´t go into the blockchain, which goes against the main principle that gives BTC a value based on the hash of previous transaction in the chain, hence making impossible to fake transactions. 
It basically turns BTC from a currency that´s based on the trust of its inherent value (aka virtual gold) to a currency based on trust on the centralized agents that verify or not all the previous transactions (aka virtual fiat). 
You can see this idea expressed in different words in this short presentation:
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:15:41
Why bother? I can just spit it once to you. :)
@_date: 2017-07-03 12:41:16
The only attacker of Bitcoin I see is you and your greed for cheaper fees and faster transactions. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:08:35
Its certainly just a theory, but the trend with conspiracy theories is that they sooner or later become conspiracy facts.
By his own words and direction he gave to the project from the beginning was clear that the thought process was highly idealistic, and those ideals escaped from time to time from his words during his whole period of activity.
Had he been interested in business he wouldnt made the project opensourced, or would had taken actions to gain control over it. 
What history tells us, is that idealistic people dont surrender their ideas for personal gains, they're even ready to endure hardships as long as their idea advances. 
And since the initial idea **was** a really good intent of liberation, I would orbit towards the assumption I wrote in the previous post. 
Btc had been moving from an ideal weapon against banks and fiat economy to a tool of profit for them  since 2013/14. Which is the time around which Satoshi went out and supposedly left his child idea in "good hands".
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:05:41
Those algos are there for their own protection. Once a certain limit is reached, the algos will see any further action as damaging to their owners and will shut off, or liquidate their positions themselves.
Things like this fueled the great flash crash of 2010
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:26:03
Google "NYSE is broken again" and you will see how many times an exchange is closed due to similar issues. 
Controlling a flash crash is a really complex issue that sometimes can't be achieved just individually closing an element. The chain of causation can be very long because people place their stops and orders for one instrument depending on the price of another.
In the end you get an avalanche effect that just destroys everyone.

The main idea behind the post was that whoever created the blockchain had the genius to use a financial incentive for people to unite CPU resources to solve calculations that otherwise would had been impossible to do. 
Giving an X amount of Bitcoins for Y amount of solved problems with a system/environment/blockchain that auto-regulated itself to increase the amount of the "tasks" to be calculated depending on the total amount of processing resources working on it. Which at the same time increased exponentially the amount of calculated data and gave value to the the received price (Bitcoin)
It explained the whole idea in good detail, with a very strong note on the unknown nature of the data being computed by every node or of what was the purpose of all of it, noticing that this was the main idea behind bitcoin, and that if the motives are "good" the results would have a "miraculous" level. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:09:12
Lol thats what they said
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:32:35
Thanks, I already took a look into the original whitepaper, but find it really "to the point", like only an abstract from a greater work. 
I really see the technology as the language people was given in the "Arrival" movie :)
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:17:19
If the "crowd" that supports BTC don´t do stupid decisions there will be a time where even 10000000000000000000000000000$ will not be worth a mBTC.
Hope BTC isnt taken out before of that.
@_date: 2017-06-22 11:17:52
Ha!  About digital markets in general. These things are called "flash crashes" and are really common in most financial markets.  I persinally know about a couple of guys that lost a lot trading stocks because of these things. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:54:04
Mostly because of ETH. They're having lots of troubles with that.
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:02:11
I think they already done that. Track weird changes in the BTC medium through the years. Many bad decisions were taken, and i doubt that big players didnt had anything to do with that.
Divide and conquer.

In you opinion. Ive heard the same thing about everyone of them

This is so childish.. like really, they closed due to a ETH flash crash to avoid damages, which is the very best thing to do and everyone goes crazy lol
