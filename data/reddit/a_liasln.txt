Thanks, this seems like a really good step in the right direction.
As it appears, there's still a bit of manual work and technical know-how involved.
What I'm hoping for is:
(1) Send a LN payment to a company (like yours) and receive in the mail a piece of hardware like this
(2) Plug it in, connect via web browser to it's friendly and easy to use UI to see (all) configuration settings, node fee info, etc
   (2.1) Clear, step-by-step instructions for creating a couple of channels and simple channel balancing info / requirements, ideally this is taken care of for me, but I get that we're not there yet.
(3) Use the built-in POS invoicing / payment system / UI that I can use from my desktop for live, in-person lightning payments.
(4) I want this device to give me an extremely easy API. Basically I want a code snippet that I can drop straight into my existing website that says "pay with lightning" button, and all I have to provide to the API is the USD amount of the thing being bought. The QR / invoice generation, public IP of my node to use, etc, should all be done for me behind the scenes.
When I have this, I can start really taking lightning pretty seamlessly for online and in-person sales. If it's even "kind of" simple, it will catch on for small business merchants. The problem I have currently is the barrier to entry getting LN invoices created, making sure my node is up and accessible, worrying about whether I'm book-keeping my invoices properly, etc.
