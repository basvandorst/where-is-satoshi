The new bonus will take precedence over the first deposit bonus as it is offered at more favourable rates. If you would like to receive a first deposit bonus instead (at a less favourable rate) please email our support team at support

I can, though I suspect it may come across as a little hollow...

Yes, I work for Cloudbet

Hi there, Dennis from Cloudbet here. We think we've got a pretty slick offering and would encourage you to give it a try - we've got instant deposits and withdrawals as well which we think you'll find pretty convenient. If you have any questions or run into any issues I'm here to help in any way I can!

Hi toastedjelly_,
I'm sorry to hear that your experience hasn't been up to the standard to which we aspire.
I understand our tech guys have been in touch with you, have identified the issue, and are working on a solution right now. Thanks for your patience and understanding.

Unfortunately the dresses don't come in my size ;)
@_date: 2014-06-12 13:32:39
That's correct

Due to an overwhelming response we have decided to remove the 5000 entry limited - we will now be accepting unlimited entries. Be sure to tell your friends!

That's correct, if you would prefer the first deposit bonus up to 5 BTC (and without the additional 1 BTC) please email I support team and they will sort it out for you.
