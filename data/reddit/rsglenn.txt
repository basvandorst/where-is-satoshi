I sent less than $500, so this shouldn't be an issue - right?
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:23:33
I bought a few today ...

Because there is a demand for bitcoins.  If there is a high demand of a commodity, the price goes up.  If there is no demand, the price goes down.  True?  Again, just a thought to ponder...
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:31:53
Me too....
@_date: 2013-04-06 19:39:04
I have done both and neither has replied to my emails.  I don't know what else to do.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:41:05
I sent money to Bitinstant via MoneyGram on April 3.  BitInstant in turn forwarded my money to Mt. Gox.  Mt. Gox tells me they do not accept deposits from BitInstant.   I have sent emails to BitInstant a few times now (and even called them)...they have NOT responded to either.  What else can I do to locate my money?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:52:53
I'm still laughing!  
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:31:08
I have been waiting all day for my funds to show up in my Mtgox account.  Is anyone else experiencing a delay with Mtgox?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:55:30
Thank you
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:00:04
Damnit....I thought as much.  My last transaction with them was a cluster F***.  Don't want to go through that again.  I want to buy some more coins, but am at a quandary as to what to do....
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:28:35
I'm looking for one too.  So far, I've checked out BitFloor, but like Gox it is down also.  Other members of this forum have suggested BitInstant, Campbx and BTC-e.
Hope this helps...

Thanks, spaceroach.  I did exactly as you suggested when investing in dotcoms.  I'm seriously thinking of buying a few bitcoins and see where it lands.  I'm a housewife, but I'm a pretty smart chicky.  Plus it wouldn't hurt to invest a few dollars now and then.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:10:44
Awwwww, ok, got it....Thanks to all of you for taking the time to explain....
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:57:43
What do you mean by saying noting to be lost but fantasy numbers?  If, say, I spend $500 from the get go and the price drops, I will certainly lose money
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:36:47
Yep, looks like trading came to hault - here we go again
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:05:45
I would love to use live chat, but it is not an option on their contact page or anywhere else on there website.  I read a post on here a couple of days ago that said live chat is not available on BitInstant.  Seems like BitInstant is incommunicado!  I'm stuck and frustrated as to what else I can do....please help Zabelin

Last week, I stepped up to a craps table with $100.  After an hour, I walked away with $3k or so and I didn't have to deal with the chaos of getting your bitcoins to its final destination.  Although, I could have bought bitcoins instead.  As I see it, bitcoins are definitely a gamble, but a gamble I'm willing to take with a few hundred dollars.
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:30:01
Aw ha!  Apparently, deposits made after 5 pm will be processed the next day.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:54:06
Bitinstant, you are repeating yourself in every posts.  Instead, fall on your sword and admit you continue to fucked up.  I'm moving on to a new service...anything is better than your fucked up service
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:36:30
I find it interesting that both Gox and Bitstamp are down, while the value of bitcoin is falling at fast pace.  Hmmm...
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:51:23

I've been going back and forth since the recent rise in Bitcoin trading/buying and the subsequent increase in Bitcoin's value.  Like everyone else, I have watched the value of Bitcoin's gains considerably in the past week.  I took advantage of the dot com mess.  Commonsense told me to buy when it was low and sell when it went high.  I made a considerable junk of change and left it alone.  Bitcoin reminds me of what happened with dotcom.

Not only should I be in the kitchen, there is laundry to do and all of the other things that housewives have to take care of.  Our job doesn't just stop at 5:00 pm.  It's a 24/7 job...
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:17:36
I don't know, but BitFloor is back up and the price is at $89 and some change.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:15:09
I agree with you Mahn.  I have been reading posts on this forum for a couple of weeks now.  As I see it, most of the exchanges utilized in transferring money or purchasing bitcoins cannot keep up with the demand, or rather, are incompetent. Mt. Gox forgets they are handling other people's money. I made my first purchase last week - needless to say, it was not a pleasant experience.  I expected these transferors/exchanges to be professional and competent.  Boy, was I wrong!
I would give you an upvote, but I can't figure how to do that (I'm a newbie).
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:38:34
I can't believe this bull shit.  Why don't you hire more employees to cover the workload more efficiently.  Btw, Charlie Shrem, you are not easy to reach. I sent emails to Bitinstant, left voicemails, posted on your facebook and twitter.  So, please don't bullshit all of us.  NO EXCUSES!  I'm happy to report that you guys finally funding my Gox account 6 days after I sent the money to you.  Why wasn't I offered an extra coin for my inconvience???

@_date: 2013-04-11 13:22:44
Vealio, I am thinking the same thing.  If you read the statement written in the forums section on Gox's website, they are not under a DDoS attack.  However, the post on Twitter claims they are under a DDoS attack.  I see a conflict here.  Looks as though one hand doesn't know what the other is doing.  I find Gox to be unprofessional and incompetent.  They are over there heads for sure.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:13:08
LOL!  I picked up some beer and ordered a pizza.

I tried to convince my hubby in investing in bitcoin.  He just laughed at me and said it's not a good idea because the price is so volatile.  For once, I listened to him and didn't buy at $200 a pop.  However, I'm thinking of taking advantage of the low price and hold on to them.
I agree that one shouldn't put all of their eggs in one basket.  I hope you didn't raid your savings or take out a loan to buy bitcoins.
I hope everything works out for you
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:33:39
Yeah, but NYSE doesn't close for an entire trading day.  Does anyone know how many days Gox will be closed?  I just don't get it... how can Gox arbitrarily closes trading at a moment's notice and think it is ok...they are handling other people's money for pete's sake.  I have lost all confidence in Gox and will move on to another exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:51:46
Sure it does....if you put on a BIG post-it
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:20:17
I have suspected all day that some wheeling and dealing is going between the exchanges.  Gox went down this morning and BitFloor followed, then this afternoon BitFloor came back soon after Gox came back.  Now, Gox is down again and BitFloor wasn't far behind.  Seems fishy to me...
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:04:02
I posted the following on another thread - I should have posted the following here...sorry for duplicate posts folks...
I've been going back and forth since the recent rise in Bitcoin trading/buying and the subsequent increase in Bitcoin's value. Like everyone else, I have watched the value of Bitcoin's gains considerably in the past week. I took advantage of the dot com mess. Commonsense told me to buy when it was low and sell when it went high. I made a considerable junk of change and left it alone. Bitcoin reminds me of what happened with dotcom. My husband thought I was crazy in buying dotcom stock - he changed his mind when I sold it and made a very good chunk of change.  I told him about bitcoin -- he just laughed at me and said "no way." So, I'm thinking about trading in bitcoin anyway.....what should I do folks?

Thank you, MiracleRiver.  I'm just getting nervous because I don't know of my payment even arrived at Mt. Gox and, if not, what do I do to find my money.  This was my first time buying Bitcoin and I have to say it hasn't been a pleasant experience...
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:39:51
This is third excuse that I have read for why Gox is down.  Check out Gox's forum page on it's site on twitter for the other two excuse for why Gox is down.  Seems to me they are throwing excuses against the wall to see which one sticks.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:25:06
Thank you, Zabelin.  I just posted on their facebook page.  I will be persistant, so wish me good luck.  This was my first bitcoin transaction and it hasn't been a pleasant one.  Thinking about not buying bitcoin in the future as all I see from posts is there are a lot of problems in trying to do so

I made a deposit at B of A yesterday.  Does localtill send an email confirming the deposit?
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:30:25
Did you send the funds to Mt. Gox via Bitinstant?  Thank you...
@_date: 2013-04-06 19:30:40
Good for you, Snakemcgraw.  Do you have any suggestions as to how to I resolve this issue?  I sent them an email with no response.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:53:05
The email BitInstant sent to me when I sent the funds says "no need to use a coupon code on this order," so they did not send me a coupon code.  I didn't see that BitInstant does not deposit to Gox in FAQ; however, BitInstant claims they do make direct deposits everywhere else on they website.  I'm stuck!
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:29:27
Thanks to all of you!
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:07:18
I'm definitely not using them again.  It took them 6 days to fund my Gox account.  They never answered my emails or returned my call.  Yesterday, my coins miraculously showed up on Gox account after many posts on here, bitcointalk, their facebook page and their twitter page.  I guess you have to be persistant (my posts were not nice because I was fed up with their excuses.  These services need to be more professional as they are dealings with other people's money.  I lost a considerable chunk of change due to Bitcoin's incompetence.  If they can't keep up with the orders, they need to hire more people - simple as that!
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:52:17
All I can recommend is be persistent.  I had the same problem with Bitinstant, so I posted all over the place until I finally received an email from Charlie, the CEO.  He apologized profusely and got off his ass and took care of the problem - it only took him a couple of minutes to transfer the money to an exchange.  Post on this forum and on bitcoinalk.org (the CEO hangs out on bitcointalk fairly often, twitter and facebook.  Good luck.

Dasstrooper, I also read that press release on Gox's website, and the post on Twitter suggests that they are under an attack.  So, I'm not sure what is going on here.  Seems to me that Gox is hiding something, or just plain incompetent.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:46:10

The only phone number I know of for Bitinstant is listed on it's support page.  I called the number twice and left messages.  I didn't get a callback, rather, I received an email from the CEO.

@_date: 2013-04-08 14:44:50
I sent money to BitInstant on April 3.  They transferred the funds to Mt. Gox.  Now, Mt. Gox tells me they do not accept deposits from BitInstant. I have not received a responses to my emails or calls. Seems like they are ignoring emails and phone calls.
