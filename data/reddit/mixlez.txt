You're right, CT, CCT and ZC introduce this. If you can't see the amount in plain text, you have to trust the mathematical proofs of quantity.
It becomes possible to print money with well-defined low probability, like it is possible for you to guess someone's private key with a well-defined low probability (that is, astronomically unlikely).
Thankfully, unlike key generation, these quantity proofs won't print money due to "random number generator" bugs like the ones that impacted some Android wallets recently. As no systems explicitly hold the secret that can be revealed to print money, there is nothing to crack but the math itself*.


It is possible to unmask transaction values with well-defined low probability. Just like private key generation, a bad random generator can cause values to be revealed.

To quote the paper (I have made updates, but this part hasn't changed much):


I think the range proof may have to be different to the novel compact smallness proof. Proving `curve.n - x` is small using the existing method would not prove that `x` is big enough. A new bigness proof would add significant size and slowness of verification, and an implementation risk. It's a trade-off, and I think non-zero fees are a better solution than doubling the cost of the system. The paper is already quite long, too.

Please see my reply to &gt; I know you didn't write Maxwell's paper
Haven't read it in sufficient detail either. Top on my reading list!
CCT solves two security issues:
- `t` gives confidence in generated proof (if too low, someone could forge coins)
- `fuzzbits` prevents brute force of hidden values (if too low, someone could reveal an output)
Ideally, both would be at 128 or above. I may have been out by a factor of roughly two in the paper, so CCT may well need 500 bytes for the same security level. And/or we could trade some `fuzzbits` in for a better `t`. Work in progress.


CCT paper is for 64-bit value actually :-p but that's not where the factor of two went.

That's ok. What I did is statistically unlikely in so, I can see why you weren't impressed :-)
Goes without saying this stuff assumes I haven't made a massive "oops" mistake in the math, which might get picked up by review or implementation, and might mean that CCT is impossible!


The short answer is yes.
The long answer is, bytes required depend on the equivalent bit-level (e.g. 128 bit or higher/lower) security you want for the hidden values. It may be that you want 256-bit security, in which case it'll cost you more than 230 bytes, maybe 500 (not exact). But mathematically, CCT does require significantly fewer bytes than CT, and does not depend on ring signatures.


I do hope the market would find a level.
@_date: 2015-06-10 05:20:11


Yes. This is part time and unfunded (*wink*), so I've got to spend a couple of days on another project before I get back to it.
My expectation was for Blockstream to release sidechains first, and hidden balance stuff much much later, giving me time to refine and maybe build a sidechain, but the early release surprised me, so I just pushed out as-is.


That makes two of us (and many more to come)!


Good spot, it looks like I've omitted the relationship between `x` and `b = 2^(fuzzbits + valuebits)`.
`T = 2^(t+l)` defines the gap between what is required to construct the proof (`x` less than small number `b`), and what the verifier can be convinced of (`x` less than bigger number `b*T`). This is fundamentally probabilistic. That is, you might be able to still construct valid proofs for `x = b + z`. But as `z` gets bigger, you're less likely to succeed.
Some values of `t`, `l` and `b` are suggested in the old [CFT proofs]( `t` is referred to as "Schnorr’s proof security parameter" (soundness), which is how many bits are in the non-interactive hash. `l` has to chosen big enough (completeness), and is forced on us depending on the choices for curve order, `t` and `b`. I have not found a full analysis with charts anywhere, so if anyone finds one that would be great.


I would not be surprised if the security is a bit lower. I once estimated that 128 bits of fuzz, and 64 bits of coin value, should give initial numbers small enough to make chance of proof failure negligible while keeping `t` near 128. But I think this is probably horrifically wrong (may need 128 more bits in the curve!). Our `T` is further limited by number of txn inputs of course. I would prefer independent confirmation rather than me pushing numbers out.

It reinforces that Bitcoin is a good idea. Watching fiat after fiat fail (including centralised btc exchanges), reminds me of watching trivial zero-day exploits for Windows over the previous decade. The correct model was always *nix, and we are getting there in the end (OSX, GNULinux/Android). Watching software has taught me that most people do not voluntarily put effort to learn to switch to a better system (without peer pressure or economic incentive). You just have to wait for the old generation of users to become less important. Day after day of watching the old system fail creates a new generation that can't be bothered to deal with the failures, and build out the new stuff.

Making moral judgements is the antithesis of Bitcoin. It does not say who the governments should judge, who has right to be violent or sell which plants. Bitcoin simply processes transactions for all.


Violence is only ever "ok" as an equal measure response to [explicit threats of] other violence. Initiation of violence is never "ok". There was some theft/fraud at MtGox, which is deprivation of property. The state will clumsily try to go in and try to figure out who-dun-it, so it can apply the equivalent deprivation of property on who they think is the perpetrator. Whether it is justified, who knows, but that's the way things work. They will attempt (and no more) to make the victims good. We all agree that theft is wrong, so "something must be done", "something is being done".
Silkroad was entirely peaceful except for the weak attempted murder allegations they tried to pin on the guy, I think? We don't all agree about which plants are dangerous to society, nor whether their distribution is as bad as theft. Nor whether connecting distributors is as bad as distribution itself. The state going in to enforce a weakly supported policy, not to punish violence nor to make victim good. And the agents naturally fucking it up.

That is what UK, IBM and UBS, etc are probably going to try and make. Cryptographic Pound Sterling that is centrally issued, with peer-to-peer transactions that can only be confirmed by the [semi-central] bank (maybe a system with n-of-m master keys for the "trusted" parties).
Blocks are really not useful for this at all. They are much better off with real-time verification.
Edit: Block delays are not a benefit of Bitcoin, they are a cost we put up with to achieve the benefits. If you want something other than a trustless cryptocurrency, you don't need the blockchain. Even for archiving, you can just use a hash tree like "git" version control.
@_date: 2015-04-10 05:50:48
That's less secure than not using POW at all, because you're essentially exposing your own system to the risks of your other trusted parties. Specifically, if any single one of your parties has a security breach, and touches a malicious powerful miner, the whole network is disabled.

There is now some agreement that the current CCT design is correct. CT requires about 10x more storage than CCT. Relative to plain old Bitcoin, CCT roughly doubles the size of a typical 2-input-2-output transaction.
A practical sticking point however is CCT requires a safe large order elliptic curve (~768-bit). I'm not aware of a (provably not backdoored) one that can be [pulled off the shelf]( I think CCT might be the first use case for such large curves. Once we find or generate such a curve, the CPU effort in doing 768-bit multiplications may be a significant barrier for adoption in Bitcoin core. had some ideas around using curve extensions from existing 512 curves instead of a full 768 curve, to make it go faster, but not sure how far he went with it.
Spent several weeks trying to generate my own provably safe curve, but couldn't get a high quality one (prime point count). This stuff doesn't pay the bills, and my idealism will be recharging for a while. Open source will get there eventually.
@_date: 2015-09-14 12:01:35
Quick update on this, I have worked out how to construct a 768 bit curve. OpenSSL precalc'd elliptic curve multiplication time (sample size 1000 on Intel Q9550):
secp256k1: 1.90ms
my768: 7.13ms
768/256 = 3.00
7.13/1.90 = 3.75
So it looks more friendly than O( n^4 ). This previous-generation desktop cpu can verify 35 CCT output proofs per second on each of the 4 cores.

It does not matter how many miners. One miner is not necessarily less powerful than one thousand miners. CEX.IO pool can be considered as a single 'miner' for the purpose of an attack.
If you create a network restricted only to the resources of a few trusted parties, those miners will be much weaker than the Bitcoin network. Probably also weaker than some alt-coins. A 51% attack would be easy, and this has been demonstrated on alts many times.
Real world companies have to manage not just operation risk, but also reputation risk. The mere possibility of looking bad in a situation like this is enough to deter the development of such systems. Especially given that block-free alternatives are available, faster when operating, and easier to build.

This question is not formulated in a way that it can actually be answered, like "how long is a piece of string". But here is a loose attempt at some hypothetical answers, to help you learn about some properties of the network:
- People mine bitcoins [too slowly]( to make any difference to the current hash rate, so it really depends on the sorts of computers they would use (i.e. the question does not give enough information). If these were powerful computers, then the supply of bitcoins would increase in the short term (price falls) until the difficulty adjustment (price reversion). The number of people as a number by itself, is only relevant with regard to transaction volume they might generate, not to mining speed (price unchanged).
- Everyone would need to mine individually, because if everyone mined in a pool, then either fees would eat up all of the coins, or there would be immediate scalability issues with 1 billion transactions per block to split the proceeds, that will overwhelm the network, as the current infrastructure cannot cope with so many small transactions (price would go to zero with pools).
- Assuming these people don't actually spend their coins, or off-chain services take a sufficient load off the network, the current software infrastructure would continue to work. There will probably be some fraction of bitcoins for everyone (if mining individually, some people might not get any directly), but a lot would be eaten up in fees like in the legacy banking system today (fees rise, demand falls, price falls).
- If all this causes excessive transaction volume, the network will be destroyed, demand will drop and the price will fall to zero. If transaction volume does not become an issue, and assuming supply and demand remain otherwise constant, the price will stay the same or rise as existing mining investors may choose to purchase the coins that they had previously expected to mine, but now someone else will mine.
@_date: 2015-04-12 08:43:26
POW is about mining power, not number of parties. All your parties would need to buy up powerful mining equipment to defend themselves, and would still be defeated because their investment will not exceed that of the public networks (they have a real business that requires the capital more). Thousands of trusted parties is what, 0.0001% (pick a magnitude) of the world? That's how weak, in terms of mining investment, the network would be.
Worse, you would have thousands of access points. A link from any single one of these to the 'real world' could overpower the network. How long can you keep each of a thousand heterogeneously configured and globally distributed hosts, from being breached? Considering that well over 1% of all computers already carry some sort of malware, this sounds risky.
What makes you think that any company would want to take this:
* miner-maintenance cost
* operational risk
* reputation risk
* additional transaction delay
Instead of just using a triple-entry accounting system, or semi-centrally n-of-m key confirmed real-time transactions?

Volatility is a bad characteristic for a currency, but negligible valuation is a worse characteristic of a currency.
When all the bitcoins in the world were valued at a few thousand dollars, it was impossible to buy a car or a house with bitcoin, because the liquidity wasn’t there.
Now, all the Bitcoins in the world are valued only at a few billion, the valuation is too small to allow use in large scale commerce. Therefore as the valuation rises, more use becomes possible.
The rapid price advances do damage to Bitcoin’s volatility profile, but this is more than offset by the new markets which become available at the higher valuation/liquidity level.

Lets go through your examples then. Examples involving state currency are no good (use of force causes bad outcomes).


A Bitcoin has been a Bitcoin and will continue to be a Bitcoin. A dollar has been a dollar and will continue to be [slightly less than] a dollar. We have 4 years of history and no significant change in substance going forward. You better have some reasoning to back up a future change in behaviour.


Tell that to Bernanke, Yellen, Kuroda :)


There are other ways. Unfortunately, the system does it the inequitable way, and forces people to comply through taxes and legal tender laws. I would be fearful of what the existing system is doing, more so than what a voluntary replacement might do.

Denninger continues to bash Bitcoin, having previously focused on tax implications.

Guess chemists aren't that much into Reddit :)

Lets wait until the daily volatility is in the 1% range and then consider it again. Because if we fix a name right now, we'd need "new new new Bitcoins" in a few months and confuse everyone.

No offence intended to either of you, but be aware you're sending money to a stranger on the Internet, and Bitcoin transactions are irreversible in all senses of the word.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:41:29
Of course, but if you provide a track record for your word (web of trust, ebay, or any kind of history linked to your reddit account for transacting several grand worth of coin), that could help the OP make a decision.

You are describing how it could be done. It is not how things are done today.
Just as banks do dodgy deals (and get caught and fined), they deploy systems with cut corners to achieve timely software delivery. Plain text.
You may recall several ATM and card outages in the UK last year. Those were just clumsy accidents. What do you think might happen if incentive is added? Do you think an accidental outage will get fixed faster, if the guy fixing it has incentive not to do so?

Whether I have a clue or not is irrelevant. Just looking at the facts here.
Money market accounts generate interest, which grows exponentially over time to infinity. The growth is very real, though not as much as you might like. This is especially well suited for seniors, whose risk profile is skewed for extra safety.
Markets were at record highs in 2008, and you could have made the same claim back then. Remember how that went? Equity or debt claims with a paper profit are not dollars.
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:55:19
MM accounts don't usually beat inflation, but they do increase your nominal number of dollars.
So it was the act of exchanging things for dollars that got you more dollars. Well done.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:12:05
So do you have more dollars now as a result of giving away dollars for other things? Or is that just a "paper profit" on some screen? Because usually it is giving away things for dollars that increases the number of dollars you have.
As for 401k, joke is on you. If people were to get the dollars out, in aggregate, do you think there would be enough dollars behind the rehypothecated credit promises? I guess you do. I remember when many 401k balances crashed 50%... that was fun.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:41:08
Before you peel off... Remember you can also spend it by exchanging it  (i.e. giving to someone like cash)! There is a small but significant premium for original physical coins where the hologram is still intact. So you can sell it on ebay for more than today's Bitcoin price.

In some jurisdictions, Bitcoin sales of red bull are already banned :)

Usually sit down in a public place (cafe?) count the cash, do a mobile-to-mobile wallet transaction and wait 10 minutes for it to confirm. There are risks involved obviously, because people can just run off. This is why smaller amounts are good. Another way to get rid of coins is just to buy stuff online. Some pizza places accept them via takeaway.com etc..
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:30:58
How about this one?
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:10:40
You totally can make an invoice expressed in BTC. Blockchain records transactions and encryption signatures are good proof for a court of law.
"Legal tender" is about debt settlement, not transactions. Don't mix them up.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:06:54
I don't have one (and never did) and don't track them except for headline news like 50% drops, so where are they now (in real terms)? Probably not in FDIC insured dollars. Certainly not where they would be if people wanted the dollars, or if ZIRP ended, or if a recession started.
Thanks for not answering my other questions.

The guy practically invented the modern internet packet routing system where providers try to route packets out to peers. He did it in one line, and let engineers figure out the minutiae:

Like sending cash by recorded mail - if you can prove the money was sent (recorded delivery for cash, blockchain for bitcoin) and you can prove the contract by showing the communication you had with the seller, you can sue in small claims court in jurisdiction of the seller. IANAL.
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:59:24
There is also the issue of stock vs flow. You are looking at stock, assuming constant flow. But if the inflow is abrupt, we may overshoot to a "market cap" of several trillion during the inflow phase, and then undershoot back down to billions...
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:12:35
The market price is £700 each, you're not gaining anything but suspicion by underpricing. If you insist on £200, I'm happy to do a cash deal in London :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:44:46
Agreed!
