Ah yes, that other coin that actually works and has no need for LN because they fixed the actual issues instead of creating a new layer that will hand all the power right back to the banks. That coin? Yeah that coin probably won’t implement any LN.

1000 tx/day eh? Cant even google properly lol. And several cents is a lot less than tens of dollars...

I like the concept, even if its not quite literal enough for the techy types on here lol
But if you wanna make some adjustments to help convey the message you should look into some of the history of crypto, IE, satoshis whitepaper or something.
A few people have done puzzles that contain an amount of btc or some such.
11 links with clues to 11 of 12 mnemonic words would be cool.
Or even just the address of the genesis block.
But if i were you, and not looking to dump a buncha money into making the sculpture into a treasure hunt, even a qr code linking to your site would be cool. Id definitely look into adding a qr code for your wallet for donations, can fund the next piece!

Youve brought up some good points, and yes onramps are a challenge, although I usually spend from my main investment and add to it as i can afford to. So my onramping is minimized, preloading once im in crypto seems like a hassle, especially because it ties up my coins. Which is important to me because i dont just deal with bitcoin.
I agree with the change leakage stuff, needs to be fixed somehow. But bitcoin usually leads in crypto right? So if lightnings the best method we should see many other coins adopting similar systems no? I suppose only time will tell.
Thanks for the chat though, cheers!

Well, btc used to be pretty quick... and bch is. I dont get how lightning is more private though, that doesnt add up to me. And microtransactions i understand, i do feel like most scenarios dont really need micro transactions though... not all but most.

Idk man, can you honestly say lightning actually adds functionality?
Edit: honestly, im mostly just concerned that lightning is centralizing the power and that at some point we’re gonna see major censorship in bitcoin, if you can tell me why thats not going to happen im all ears, maybe im missing something idk.

Is it scaling if its layer 2? Wouldnt that be layering? Bch is just bitcoin before the powers that be decided that crypto was too open and immutable. Gotta have all those checks and balances so nobody can spend without authorization right? Wouldnt want the public to control their own money would we?

Most of my on chain btc transactions take between 20-60 mins, i had one ages ago that didnt go through for a full day. Which i thought was absurd. But bch is never more than 20 in my experience. And i cant really speak to the privacy of lightning, i dont know enough about it, will do some reading. Regardless, yes i can agree that micro transactions are new functionality, but it feels like a hell of a lot of overhead just for a feature that i dont see most users needing.
Idk ever had one of those refillable gift cards? Thats what having a lightning wallet feels like to me. I dont want to refill my card every week, i just wanna pay with cash. Nevermind worrying about whether or not my wallet can find a path to yours through the nodes.
