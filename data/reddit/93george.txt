That’s not how it works.
If bitcoin hits $200,000 tomorrow and then comes back down to $10,000 by this Friday and the hash rate stays the same throughout it means it was profitable to mine the entire time for all of those miners.
If the price hits $2 the following Monday and the hash rate decreases by 50% it wasn’t because the miners were concerned about the volatility of bitcoin price it was because for that half of the miners it was no longer profitable to mine due to their electric rate and/or other expenses so they turned off their machines.

Adoption and energy usage are not correlated. 
Hash rate is much higher than needed to simply maintain network everything after that is simply security.
Price and energy usage are correlated.

I could be mistaken but it seems like all they have to do is say “We can’t talk about it while the investigation is still ongoing”
If they never close their investigation they never have to answer any questions about where it went. Seeing as how it’s an internal investigation they have no reason to rat out their own people.

Maple syrup federation of Canada uses a similar business model. They basically just keep warehouses filled with 55 gallon drums of syrup off the market.
They cap the amount producers can sell them and are the only legal buyers *and* sellers of syrup  it’s a big racket.
Edit: and another thing comes to mind, my mother takes a patented iron supplement called feotol or something she likes it because it doesn’t upset her stomach which is why everyone else likes it and the reason for it’s patent. Shit you not I am instructed to buy whatever they have any time I see it, they can’t keep it on the shelves, and this shit ain’t cheap.
Have to make up that they are just artificially lowering supply to keep the price up.
