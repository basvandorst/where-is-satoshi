Lighting is going to fail hard. You tie up say 1 BTC in a Lightning channel. Takes a few days to get in the channel because well the network will still be clogged (don't kid yourself 7tx/sec is terrible even with 8MB blocks it's only 56). Great now you can spend it fairly easily, quickly and cheaply. Now, uh oh, the channel unexpectedly closed. You'll get your remaining balance back eventually. But in the meantime you have no funds to spend and even if you did have reserved coins it'll still take a while + fees to open another channel.
It's like locking up your debt card for a few days while you wait a week for a new one in the mail.
Please tell me where I'm wrong. And if your answer is something to the effect of the mempool won't be backlogged, please refrain from even commenting because that's asinine

Can someone answer me this 1 question?

Nah. It's called Bitcoin can't scale and is dying. 
Ib4 "this time it's different"

I already sold my bcash. I'm still bag holding a fuckload of Bitcoin, hoping to god I am wrong.

BTW the core dev weekly Thursday meeting has started here: 
We'll see if any relief is being planned
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:56:45
Yes and that time will be what? If the mempool is like it is now who knows when you'll get it back. Bitcoin was idealistic in it's idea that it is better than traditional money transfer. It's not anymore and ive finally seen passed my wishful ignorance
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:36:56
I don't. Or else I would have cashed out. I want to see it as a useful tool to transact in a borderless, trustless, semi-instant, low fee, manner. It is failing at two of the 4 I listed right now. I think for any crypto to be widespread and ubiquitous it needs 4/4.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:52:45
Yeah Ideally I'd move the BTC to a BTC wallet, BCH to BCH wallet, BTG to BTG wallet for each paper wallet (I have over 20) and throw out the old paper. This is a PITA and I just really care about moving the BTC now to a more secure Hardware wallet while keeping the 20+ paper wallets with the alt coins as I don't plan on doing anything with them for now, but I don't want to lose them either.

Zooming all the way out you can see a massive increase in the amount of sell orders relative to buy. Blue line indicates about what the graph looked like a week ago
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:34:07
You are missing the point. I don't care about the USD value in bitcoin that I have (well I care to some extent) but I want Bitcoin to be USEFUL. I want to send transactions to anyone any where in a short amount of time. I want bitcoin to be adopted by online retailers. And I want to ditch the banks!
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:39:53
big if true
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:57:54
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:42:05
I'm not pulling out. I think "crypto" is hear to stay. The question is will bitcoin be the face of that market still?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:56:12
Lol just look at it's post history. Clearly doesn't have it's head screwed on right, that's for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:08:12
I didn't say you have it all in a channel. But what you just said is equivalent to saying it's not a big deal to be cut off from your checking account for days because you still have a savings account
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:20:27
Keep holding those bags kiddo
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:53:15
And what I'm saying is the Lightning network is being propped up as a grand solution when in reality it is terribly flawed and only good in niche scenarios. If bitcoin cannot maintain being fast, cheap and reliable then it's dead. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:39:50
I agree with everything you said here. But how long will that first mover advantage play a role? 6 more months? a year? Without Lightning or something else (even just a solid roadmap) to ease this mess, I fear what the outlook for Bitcoin is in a year. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:40:25
"hopefully" 
And if hopefully doesn't work? Then what? You're left sitting on your hands until it reopens in a few days/week
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:37:50
I see. Thanks for the info! 
Would you have a recommendation of what android application I can use to move these balances? Is there a risk when I am doing this that the app will move both into another address? how does it know I want to move either the bitcoin or bch?
