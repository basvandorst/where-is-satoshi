1) Why do you keep your money in a bank? Probably because it is more convenient than storing hoards of cash at home. Storing bitcoins in a wallet whose keys are under your control is far easier. 
2) You can hold the bank responsible in case there is a theft. The bank will normally be insured and will provide you some amount in case of a theft. Of course, a banking system collapse can happen but that is a doomsday scenario and if we talk about doomsday, anything can happen and there is no point in doing anything.
3) Now when you come to storing bitcoins on exchange, what advantage do you have? Why won't you want to have control over your money when you can secure it on a bitcoin wallet. The exchanges are prone to hacks (every electronic system is) under normal circumstances not doomsday scenarios. One advantage you will have that you'll be able to trade on current prices if you store it on the exchange - for that keep some amount on the exchange. 
4) What legal recourse you have once you lose your bitcoin? Since Bitcoins transactions are one way and there is no way to get it back unless the receiver agrees to do so - you can't do anything. 
5) Banks are normally regulated through a central banks and are under governmental control. These exchanges are private companies and there is not as much regulation of them as of the banks. Bitcoin being a difficult concept to grasp and define does not help and governments are also struggling as to what to do with it. 
I don't understand why you even are having this debate. Keep most of your bitcoins with you on a wallet under your control. It is not very difficult and definitely easier than storing all your money as cash at your home. This sub and would be more than happy to help you secure your bitcoins. That's what this community is.

Wanted to get a taste of how it all works before making a bigger than that purchase. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 02:42:39
Are those addresses infinite? Can electrum keep generating new addresses?
@_date: 2017-01-20 03:13:41
I don't think this is going to happen. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 13:30:54

What is this about? Good or bad?
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:03:20
Where did anyone say it is a safe haven? 
Any advise thread mentions that don't put in more than you can lose. 
Of course, this sub is a circle jerk of bitcoin supporters and enthusiasts and hence few threads go overboard in promoting it but majority ask to take caution.

@_date: 2017-01-06 12:53:54
You are just being argumentative. 
I'm new bitcoiner and almost everyone told me to be cautious and not invest more than I can afford to lose and it is still volatile and not mature. 
I liked you post and even up voted but by your comments it seems you are just going on a rant. 
There are few people here who believe in bitcoin and AR holding but even most of them advise not to put more in to bitcoin than you can afford to lose as of now. If you are believer in the potential and can take a risk, then dive as deep as you want. 
When you give this advice in the starting itself, I think you make people already cautious of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 09:48:23
So someone can use my public key to guess my private key if it was weak? 
Here is the particular example. I use electrum and it generates the 12 word seed in the beginning. If someone knows my public key (since it is public, it is possible right?), they can find their way to the seed? I mean, that is theoretically possible?
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:47:17
Unocoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 01:58:44
@_date: 2017-01-16 09:12:31
How can someone crack a private key? 
Is a public address enough to do this? This should not be possible right?
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:10:58
Not really. 
Though if someone wants to steal 25$ worth of bitcoins, I guess he needs it more than me :P
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:00:13
I know. I haven't invested much anyway but holy moly it is swinging like crazy!!
@_date: 2017-01-06 11:27:01
Let it be. I only visit this sub because I like this sub atmosphere. 
The breaching of $800 mark was really a magical and cute moment in this sub! 
Somehow, even $1000 didn't compare to the 800 imo.

@_date: 2017-01-13 04:51:31
Ah well, got your point. 
I can create a new wallet or delete my reddit account. That would safeguard me from this mistake I made right?
I don't know if I'm really big enough for someone to put so much effort in to knowing my identity but yeah, I got your point.
@_date: 2017-01-18 04:14:10
Cool. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-01-12 19:13:21
Damn, I just broke my bitcoin virginity today.
You missed it. I think I can still have some more though :P
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:24:42
It is not that.
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:16:58
I don't understand what you mean by spread?
@_date: 2017-01-13 02:58:48
That would give you my wallet address which is public anyway right? 
Plus you will need to subpoena reddit to get my identity and stuff. 
Is it that big a risk?
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:26:24
What exactly happened? Did they just warn or ban? 
Isnt this bad for the future of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:25:50
Can you kindly link 3? I want to see in what context are they saying that. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 13:42:13
Haha lol. I'm a newbie. 
I thought I missed as I was thinking of buying at $930 and then it went to $1100 in a blink. Not it is back to below $800. 
This thing swings like crazy.
@_date: 2017-01-28 04:22:26
It took me over a week. 
It really is difficult to get started easily. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 17:49:23
Yep, it is quite confusing in the beginning with seeds, master keys, public keys, private keys, addresses, wallet passwords and so many wallets - especially when everything is a long string of letters. I think I have got the hang of it now though. 
Yeah, I had this doubt about electrum. I didn't know it decentralized and can't be shut down as pointed out by another user. I thought if the service shuts down due to some reason, what would be the procedure be to get the wallet contents on another wallet service, say mycelium. 
Another person suggested me to export the private keys and use those to restore my wallet of any other service. I went and tried to export those keys and electrum showed me a many keys. My question is, will I need only one of the keys or I'll have to copy all the keys in to mycelium to recover my coins? The seeds might have some 'compatibility issues' but the private keys can be used with any wallet. Is my understanding correct? Am I making sense to you? 
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:47:46
Can you eli5 this halving which happens?
@_date: 2016-12-27 01:50:49
Thanks for writing that up. 
I think I got it. I will be able to use the 12 word seed to recover my wallet using any program. That's all I wanted to know. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 11:48:34
What the hell is going on guys?
@_date: 2016-12-26 14:25:26
So, kindly correct me if I'm wrong. New user.
I just downloaded Electrum wallet on my windows machine and set up a wallet. It generated a 12 word seed for me which I have written on a paper and kept it safe. Then of course, there is a password for the electrum Wallet which it uses to encrypt something. 
According to what you are saying, If I use that Seed in another wallet program, for example - mycelium to create my wallet, I would get all the bitcoins I had in my Electrum Wallet? 
Is that 12 word seed all there it is to protect? 
@_date: 2017-01-16 15:17:41
Thank you. 
The way the post is titled, it seems as if OP used the public key to crack private key. That was really a scary read at first sight. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:13:59
Crap article.
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:33:44
You inspired me to buy some more :D
@_date: 2016-12-26 16:01:52
I think I'll have to copy all the keys. 
Thanks for the help still.
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:47:28
How does unocoin compare with Zebpay. Anyone used both?
@_date: 2016-12-26 15:18:07
Ok. So in case electrum shuts down or goes bankrupt or whatever, I'll have to go through this process of converting my 12 word Seed to the xprv key to recover my wallet?
Do all wallets use their own method to generate this 12 word seed and are incompatible with each other?
Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2016-12-26 15:37:03
Oh, didn't know that. 
Another wallet, as in another Electrum wallet or any other wallet - mycelium/armory etc etc? 
I just tried what you said and it showed me so many private keys. Would any one will be enough? 
Sorry if I'm sounding like a complete idiot.
@_date: 2016-12-27 03:14:20
That's what I wanted to understand. 
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-04-21 00:16:10
This is truth at the current transaction rates. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 03:03:52
As far as I know, you can't exactly determine what the size is going to be. Someone more knowledgeable can correct me if I'm wrong. It depends on various factors such as the size of the transaction, your wallet, number of inputs/outputs etc. 
However, wallets will let you select the fee in Sat/Byte. For example, Electrum has a slider on its *send bitcoin* tab which allows you to set the fee before sending. 
You can check the status and distribution of transactions according to their fee here:  It also shows you the current best fee to get the tranx confirmed in a reasonable time. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 00:56:13
It was from an exchange which doesn't give me the option to set the fee. 
However even the fees are getting on the higher side now. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 10:39:02
It was my regular schedule of buying small amounts every 3 weeks. 
Moreover, this pace really was pissing me off. I was in conflict whether I should buy this time or wait for a drop as this has gone too high too quickly and has now made me very skeptical. It definitely has happened to me that the price drops after I buy. So I decided - what the hell. I'll buy and see of the luck rules not in my favor again.
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:34:23
I just paid $1.5 on a $20 transaction which I had to do :/

@_date: 2017-05-09 10:14:03
Enough. I bought some. Should start to drop any moment now. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 09:59:16
Except it is not rubbish. There are many new bitcoiners these days and they are all encountering such long confirmation times. 
There needs to be a solution. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:18:40

@_date: 2017-05-04 15:40:43

@_date: 2017-05-12 02:24:07
Time it takes to confirm these days is pushing bitcoin out of many practical use cases. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:54:23
You think it was not? 
It was definitely a factor. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 05:01:15
Just re-confirming. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:22:18
Don't think this is the biggest negative 'news' about bitcoin even if it is the biggest attack of its kind.
It survived silk road, don't think this will affect much imo.  
@_date: 2017-05-10 02:37:25
Many software wallets will allow you to set the fee on its transaction page/tab. 
currently, 200 Sat/byte is a good fee. There are also online estimators to do the same.
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:28:36
120 is too low imo. I did a huge trax yesterday with a 139 fee and it took almost 17 hours to get the first confirmation. 
Expect to wait more. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:40:28
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:10:57
Haha sure. I know. To be frank I wasn't expecting it to touch even 1700 so soon so I have revised my targets :P
It is alright though. I'll definitely at least cash out the original amount which I invested. The extra is all going to stay. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:35:03
2% rise a day is pretty steep imo. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 02:46:56
I'm sorry for using the language I used but tbf your comment itself looked like a rant against me as if I'm calling for the doom of bitcoin. 
I understand your argument but with high fees such as these days and time it is taking to get confirmed - it certainly isn't a big positive.My transaction was still fairly big so I probably don't mind about setting a high fee. However, if that transaction was for 1/5th of that amount, I don't think I would be happy. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 05:01:26
Got it, thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-10 02:01:43
When people become arrogant and fail to acknowledge that problems exist, businesses fail. 
Instead of going on a rant against me, acknowledge that bitcoin transactions are increasingly getting priced out for many use cases. 
Also, FYI - I have already put a mail to them about this. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:57:25
How do you explain the maths? How do you explain that I can in my notebook make a calculation on where one of those things called stars will after 6 months?

@_date: 2017-05-09 05:22:36
Lol. Though there is also a saying which goes don't put more than what you can afford to lose. 
We are all optimistic but we still advise to exercise caution. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 08:31:34
I made the same argument in a thread a few hours back and I was thrashed here.
People said I don't understand bitcoin and should stick to debit cards. 
The fees and confirmation times are getting ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:43:31
Isn't it still sustaining? I don't see it crashing as of now.
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:50:55
Yeah when it went 1300 it seemed the same to me and I regretted not buying more. Then it came to 900 and I was relived that I could but at that price. 
I don't want to buy at this price. 
Although I must say when 800 was crossed, the atmosphere in this sub was fucking magical. Probably because it took a long time and only hardcore hodlers were active. These days there are too many people. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:23:51
So it is positive?
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:26:34
Lol yeah. This isn't crash mode exactly.
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:09:17
Hey, I agree with you. I also want what's best for bitcoin. I want bitcoin to be able to function in both capacities. 
I do think segwit is the way to go and even the majority supports it. 
However, I'm not going to stop complaining what I find is wrong in my opinion. I also believe unless bitcoin is used for transacting, there is going to be a resistance in making people confident in investing in Bitcoin because, let's be frank, it is not a technology which is easily understandable. We need more and more people to do their daily transactions with bitcoin so that there is consumer confidence. Currently, small amounts already have very high fees sometimes and I do have to think twice before doing such transactions. This imo will impede the growth especially if altcoins start coming up with better solutions and scaling. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:25:42
Is this pace sustainable? Genuine question

@_date: 2017-05-10 03:32:10
No, you money won't go anywhere. I think the deadline was 72 hours but has been revised recently. If the transaction doesn't go through it is reversed to the address from where it came from. There is nothing in the middle where bitcoin can be lost. It will either be at the receiving address or the sender address. 
The exchange will also basically send you bitcoins and they'll need to get confirmed. You should talk to the exchange for their policies in case the transaction doesn't go through.
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:59:09
Not really. However the pace definitely makes it for me a case of too good to be true. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 10:52:19
Are you not skeptical of this rally? You think it is going to crash? 1300 itself was amazing I thought. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 03:25:44
Well, if the fee was indeed low, then sadly yes. Though many times transactions do go through but lately with the price rise and publicity many new users are coming to bitcoin increasing the number of transactions. 
Scaling is an issue which bitcoin really needs to solve. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:32:32
