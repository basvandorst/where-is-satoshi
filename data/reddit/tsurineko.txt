Well do you? The question mark denotes a question, in case you weren't sure.

My number 1 suggestion for you is to buy from an American exchange and put it all on a hardware wallet. If you just want to hold it, then put your hardware wallet in a safe deposit box and memorize your twelve word key.

Here is my knowledge of wallets, in relatively basic terms, from beginning to end. 
Essentially, when you store bitcoin in a 'wallet,' you're storing it under a really big number, called an address. This address is ultimately derived from something called a private key. In order to access the bitcoin you have associated with your address, you need your private key. 
Wallets, (electrum, breadwallet, bitcoin core wallet, trezors, ledger nanos, etc.) are pieces of software that securely generate and store these keys, and the public addresses that come from them. They also usually have the functionality to send funds to another bitcoin address. 
 For a beginner, I would recommend keeping the small amount of coin you'll buy in an exchange like Coinbase (extremely user friendly). But, once you start accumulating real value, I HIGHLY recommend you get a hardware wallet to keep it safe. Not an encrypted back up drive, etc. I myself can be a bit paranoid, I make sure to never have any sort of private key etc on my computer or even in my clipboard. I would recommend doing the same, safety can't hurt. 
TL;DR Coinbase vaults/wallets are great for beginners but once you care about the investment a hardware wallet is the way to go.

While large scale inflation is bad for obvious reasons, it must not be confused with healthy levels of inflation. In some cases, inflation is necessary for economic growth, encouraging people to take out loans and to spend their money. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:43:21
It's still in the mail. Though, with the heavy inspection I have done of the reviews and whatnot, they seem to be extremely usable and secure. I plan to keep one in a safe deposit box and the other in a safe in my house.

You can't buy from PayPal on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:15:38
The only reason to unsub from rbitcoin would be if you are a conspiracy theorist who wants to sit in an echo chamber of lies about bitcoin unlimited all the time (aka rbtc). 
@_date: 2017-02-05 03:22:40
Use Coinbase instead, you can buy with credit card instantly.

I'm starting to invest in mining, just bought a new antminer s9. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:31:58
But that would raise btc price. If they took upon that strategy they'd ban crypto withdrawals instead. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 11:53:24
I've known of its existence since it's very early days, but I only got into it the first time the price spiked. I was convinced it was dead after it dropped again but I have much more faith in it now.

$1000? Maybe?
@_date: 2017-02-14 05:52:21
It has plenty of market support. The recent growth line is just passing the actual price, we're probably going to rally and then fall to a price that is just a bit higher than what it is now, probably somewhere around the 1050 range IMO. 
No expert here though.

It's just as petty to believe I would do that as it would be for me to actually do that. 
Mike Pence is extraordinarily far neo-conservative, about far right as you can get.

You can go ahead and try it on my address, I'd be happy to help you test your theory, so long as you supply the coins. ;)

You can use bread wallet, there is another good wallet coming to iOS soon but I can't remember the name of it.

Wildly implausible until quantum computing becomes more widely developed, when traditional encryption becomes irrelevant.

I'm not going to reply to all of these brainwashed comments, but inflation is an important aspect of the economy that, as I said, keeps the money flowing. Go back to college.

What if I'm libertarian and also believe trump is going socially authoritarian on us, which always and I mean ALWAYS has lead to economic authoritarianism as well?
It's not just a left/right spectrum. It's two dimensional.

If you're in the US then there's not much that's nearly as credible and safe as Coinbase out there, unless you want to pay massive fees on Gemini. If you really don't want to use Coinbase then you can use localbitcoins which is very overpriced. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 00:44:26
Eh it's not wrong
@_date: 2017-02-26 15:29:00
The US still has their dollar "monopoly" if you wish to call it  that, and I assume we have several decades left of that at the very least. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 04:33:25
This is a good idea.

I use electrum and keep my 12 word recovery phrase memorized, but if you have 14 xbtc then I highly suggest you get a trezor.
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:51:49
Because bitcoin is still volatile. Diversify your assets.

@_date: 2017-03-08 04:34:58
Hell no. I'm not stupid. I just think that seeing half the rbitcoin posts being about rbtc is at least mildly annoying when you came here for intelligent discussion about this currency instead of just politics. Do you disagree?
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:44:33
A bit of advice: put those three bitcoins on a trezor, lock it in a safe, and forget about it for several decades until you're ready to retire.
Don't stress yourself if/when we hit our next crash :P

I kind of hope it gets denied so I can get some more $1000 coins
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:39:25
I give it roughly a 1 in 5 chance, given the positive feedback in the letters. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:38:15
Of course, but the dozens of posts that have no redeeming content in them need to stop. Thank you for proving I wasn't delusional. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:32:12
Well I apologize if I came across as rude and conspiring as you did. 
I am okay with intelligent conversation and debate. However, the emotional splodge of anti rbtc content is still annoying. If I see emotionally based politics on a social platform, even if I agree with them, I typically dislike or unfollow the page and move on. 
If you insist on spamming my Reddit feed with emotionally charged, pointless, constant criticism of a completely different sub, then I will stop using rbitcoin and stop considering it a reliable and interesting source of information. 
Trust me when I say that you're driving away potential users of bitcoin with these shame posts.

I'm not trying to shit stir, I was just alerted when I saw that BU support passed segwit. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:24:09
But what if this hardfork is the imperfect bitcoin unlimited which inevitably will have critical bugs?
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:34:31
Of course. But maybe we can reduce the ratio from 1:2 to 1:10 (exaggeration of course)? That content in excess will drive away potential new bitcoin users. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 02:16:57
If it hasn't gone through yet try putting it through the [bitcoin transaction accelerator. ]( 
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:21:41
Bitcoin would have to reach ~$280,000 for that to happen.

Coinbase's customer support is shit, I had to tweet at them after four unresponded-to tickets that I waited the maximum time for to get noticed. I recommend if this problem persists to file a support ticket and tweet at their support twitter.

You could just not sell your bitcoins...
Canadianbitcoins, coinbase, and localbitcoins are all options though, if you insist.

Why do you think less regulations destroy competition? I don't want to get into a debate, it just seems more logical to me that anti-trust laws are more in favor of protecting us from monopolies, which obviously increases competition. 
Just curious to hear your views.
@_date: 2017-01-29 03:24:17
Because, regardless of whether it is true (which it probably is), it is extremely emotionally charged material. This kind of stuff is what fuels conspiracy theories like Obama being a communist. It just puts a very cynical, conservative lens on the world, and I don't like that. 
I'd be perfectly fine if they expressed their political opinion in a more informative way, like other conservative news outlets do; I've never seen an Economist, WSJ, Fiscal Times, etc. article that is using heavy, shameless rhetoric as harshly as in this video.
