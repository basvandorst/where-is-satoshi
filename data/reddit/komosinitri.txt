The machines are coming ...

Simply fascinating!
@_date: 2015-06-11 12:13:48
Good read.

How could this reasonably be done? By mobile device? By email perhaps?
@_date: 2017-02-22 20:53:45
How will this create value for the economy?

Scaling will come as more developers learn the open source code and fork it.
@_date: 2016-01-22 17:18:10
This is interesting. Very interesting.
@_date: 2016-12-16 18:31:27
Good food for thought.

No it won't!!
You guys know nothing of bitcoin or even tax!

Bitcoin will surpass gold in 2017 and not look back.
@_date: 2016-12-11 04:02:19
Good article. Bitcoin has a few key advantages over gold such as portability and divisibility.

Enjoyed this quiz with a 45 minute time limit. Fortunately I finished well before and learned from my incorrect answers.

More than anything, it seems to be an ideological issue for bitcoin. What does the community envision the technology to be?
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:28:44
How has your perception of the world changed since you dived down the rabbit hole that is bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:30:12
This is not news to anyone who has been watching bitcoin for the last few years.
It has tremendous disruption potential to the financial industry.
@_date: 2016-02-22 04:52:15
This. The level of sophistication that goes into our technology today demonstrates that people (on average) will continue to know less of the things which they rely on.

I don't think the word 'dangerous' adequately describes bitcoin either. More like 'revolutionary' or 'groundbreaking'.

Roger Ver should hand over the bitcoin.com domain to someone who is qualified.

Leave the older (currently in power) generation behind and let us build our own society.
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:30:10
Momentarily ... I'm sure we will be back in no time !!
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:06:40
All aboard the bitcoin train.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:44:51
Buy 100 bitcoin.

Now you should make a "Political Advocates of Bitcoin".
Travis Patron, [Canadian Nationalist Party]( right-wing nationalism, Canada, establish national bitcoin trust

Sometimes all it takes it reaching out to the person and explaining the benefits. Nice work!
