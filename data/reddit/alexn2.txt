I would also like to note that you don't need to register in order to play the game. Just tap Login as Guest to start trading.

\&gt;Or simply use the sandbox of coinbase pro?
As I understand the coinbase pro sandbox allows to test their API, not exactly related to the game.
\&gt; Would need some users to get it going but I think your app will have the same issue.
Yes, we already have active users but of course the more the better. Also we have a market maker bot which provide the liquidity but doesn't affect the prices much. It guarantees that you always are able to buy/sell but in every case your orders affect the price.
I know that there are many such things such as dummy broker accounts and forex/binary options related apps. But they all just use current exchange price as a random number generator. Think about it, it's crucial.
What I created is a closed market simulator. I mean the game doesn't generate exchange prices as  a random numbers and you just buy low and sell high. Only players' supply and demand affect the prices. In such conditions every player affect the market price as it is on the real markets. And only in this case you can feel the market dynamics. For example, you can pump the price by buying significant amount, but if you just sell high, you don't make any profit. You need to make other players buy in order to make profit on dump.
The game also provide the ability to take/give loans to other players with any interest rate. So you can be a banker if you wish. This creates more deep gameplay.
