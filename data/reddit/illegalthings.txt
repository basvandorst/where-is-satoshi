Perhaps they manage their finances so well that all of their expendable income goes directly towards non-taxable destinations like 401k’s, HSAs, FSAs, etc?
Maybe their money is just tied up? Maybe they *are* spending their expendable income on Bitcoin?

I know a lot of people who work both remote and on-site. It's really hard to argue that working remotely is superior. It may be cheaper, especially when you're based out of a city like SF, but there's a lot of work involved in building a team and culture that works well remotely. If you've worked in a successful remote team you may take a lot of that for granted, but if you've worked for an unsuccessful one its glaringly obvious how much you'd benefit from having everyone in the same location.

Could you explain in detail why this is the case? The government can say selling heroin is illegal and they can say transferring pirated copies of movies is illegal, so why couldn't they say selling bitcoins is illegal or that transferring bitcoins is illegal? From a practical perspective, they already have regulations in place on forex trading, why wouldn't they just apply the same rules to bitcoins and make them more restrictive?
I don't necessarily think the gov't will actually ban BTC, but I certainly don't think its outside the realm of possibilities.

I mean, HTTP is a centralized protocol, but so is 95% of other protocols being actively used. Decentralized protocols are a relatively recent thing. 
I'd also argue that your statements about HTTP being the new TCP is becoming outdated. WebSockets are removing the reliance on HTTP by browsers. I'd argue the popularity of HTTP, and its use as a transport layer, is the direct result of it being the only protocol natively supported by browsers. Moving forward, it (or its successor, HTTP/2) will probably still be used for request/response style responses, but we'll be able to move past the square peg/round hole hacks of the past.

It's _really_ hard to break even when you're paying for electricity. I bought a new computer earlier this summer and I mine to help offset the cost. If I were paying for electricity, I'd be operating at a loss. That being said, my setup certainly isn't the most efficient, and new special purpose hardware is going to help.

This. Proof of work is required to verify transactions, but the amount gained from transaction fees are next to nothing compared to mining coins. When we run out of coins to mine the fees will still be very small but technology will have caught up and a proof of work will be completed significantly faster. 
Technology will improve which will make it more profitable, but competition over transaction fees will make it less profitable. Supply and demand will basically ensure that the profitability will remain fairly consistent (sans bubbles and market inefficiencies).

Everything you provided as a use case for a private blockchain has been around for many years using well established technologies. Blockchain is quite far from being the first distributed fault tolerant auditable solution, and I simply don’t ever seeing is overtaking an alternative where trust can easily be established. The key here is trust... when trust can be established, there are much more efficient ways to achieve consensus. 
That isn’t to say I don’t think blockchain will be useful in the healthcare space. I just think that private blockchains will never be practical. 
What I do think is reasonable is a semi-private blockchain. Something where partial trust can be established. For example, a trusted network where participants aren’t a single company, but a number of companies all working together. Think trade groups.

Hedging is an action you can take to reduce risk when there is partial trust (or alternatively increase reward at the cost of additional risk). 
Alternatively you can accept the risk.

Speaking of which, are there any businesses out there that provide zero confirmation transaction verification. Adding a few nodes to identify competing transactions would significantly reduce the risk of double spending. 
I’d imagine you could easily be 99% confident a double spend won’t happen within a few seconds of submitting a transaction.

The money hasn’t actually transferred to your bank when you withdraw it. Banks will usually mark these transactions as pending and will sometimes allow you to withdraw the money if your balance is high enough and they deem it as not very risky. It’s all smoke and mirrors to make it look fast, but if you had a zero balance or you were transferring thousands of dollars you might have a different experience. It’s more akin to accepting a transaction with zero confirmations and saying the money is in your wallet.

Yeah, I agree, it’s definitely worth pointing out that even if your storage is cold, your aren’t necessarily protected if you have other gaping security holes in your process. You’re only as secure as your weakest link, and that would be the insecure computer used to generate your keys. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:41:10
Those aren’t typically considered cold wallets because you connect them to a computer. A cold wallet is usually a wallet stored on a usb drive, hard drive, or some other long term storage and never connected to a computer. Typically you’d store it in a secured location like a fireproof lock box so it can’t easily be destroyed or stolen. 
A ledger or treznor could be considered a cold wallet if you never connected it to a computer, but in practice is actually sits somewhere in between a cold wallet and a hot wallet.

It’s not really a rumor. It’s unknown if the keys were lost, Satoshi died, or they’re alive and just holding on to them. 
The addresses associated with Satoshi are pretty well known though. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:58:26
The defining characteristic of cold storage is that it isn’t connected to the internet in any way. So, it depends on how they’re used. Connected to a computer on the internet and it’s considered hot storage no matter how secure you think the device is. Disconnected, it would be considered cold. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:46:23
There’s absolutely evidence he has at some point in time had access to an inordinate amount of BTC. Whether Satoshi still has access or is even still alive is a different question. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 23:40:08
Even then, the money hasn’t been transferred until it’s cleared like you said. The banks get around this using a few things. Like you said, insurance is a big one. They also store large amounts of money in vostro accounts as a buffer to fluctuations in balances. The third thing necessary for a system like this is enough liquidity and volume to balance out transaction imbalances between banks, thereby reducing the amount of money needed in reserve. All of these things are extremely expensive for banks to maintain, and it’s sometimes unreasonable for a small bank to participate in a network like this. Because of these reasons, most banks have limits much lower than 250k, frequently as low as 10k.

Why not? Do you trust anyone completely with zero doubt? Do you trust no one at all? I trust that the economy won’t collapse under my government, but not absolutely, and I know there is a chance things will fail. I put money in my bank and mostly trust they will return it to me when I ask. There’s a homeless man down the street from me I think most likely won’t return my money, but there’s a 5% chance he will. I’d actually argue that all trust is relative to the individual and always partial.

My call is that there will be a correction, but it won't be as big as a lot of people think. There's certainly a lot more adoption by larger companies in the past 6 months, and that's likely a major cause of the current rise in price. The spike in early 2011 was primarily speculative, and caused by being featured in various news outlets, which caused a rush to buy.
If you look at the all-time charts you can see that it corrected itself, and by late 2011 it started rising steadily, right up until Jan 1st of this year. At this time the price shot up. Maybe this is caused by major adoption, but to me it looks like too much. I'd guess that in the next 3 months it'll correct to the lower 20's and then rise again.
Also, the volume is still low enough that one really well written article could create another bubble that'd change all of this, so its actually really hard to say with any certainty how it'll actually play out.

Infinity. If USD ever crashes to having zero value and 1 BTC has any value then 1 BTC will be worth infinity dollars.
Realistically, this is highly unlikely as people will inevitably keep USD as novelty items and thus will always have some small value.

To be fair, it is technically possible to counterfeit a bitcoin (overwriting transactions). It'd just take a multiple of the combined computing power of the top 100 supercomputers all acting in concert. If you were able to pull this off, you'd only really be able to double spend, so it'd also require a market that would accept your payment and turn a blind eye to the obvious attack going on. Of course, as popularity increases this will become increasingly difficult.

The answer is, and always will be "it depends". I understand the point you're trying to make, but throwing out numbers that are an order of magnitude (likely multiple orders of magnitude, very few products have a 2700% markup like your numbers suggest) off doesn't help your case, especially when it's an argument where the numbers actually make a difference.

Coinbase doesn't give much detail on how they derive their numbers, but my guess would be that the chart reports their buy price, which would be a terrible deal. The only reason I'd guess this is it makes the chart look more appealing.
I checked out other markets and none of them showed a spike, so it could also be incorrect.

The exchange of bitcoins on their own is a worldwide thing that isn't effected by regional differences. The regional price differences come from the exchanges that convert other currencies into and out of BTC. These exchanges have their own prices set by supply and demand, and differences between exchanges are considered inefficiencies of the market.
When the price difference becomes large enough arbitrage opportunities open up. What this means is that after all transaction fees (factoring in risk of someone else correcting the difference before you can) you can buy in one market and sell for higher in another market. Essentially, if you're faster than everyone else then you are guaranteed a profit. As it becomes easier to buy and sell and more people begin trading these inefficiencies will become smaller and smaller.
The same thing happens in the world of stock exchanges and foreign currency exchanges. These exchanges are more efficient for a few reasons. Most obviously its because there's more people actively participating. There's also a variety of financial instruments (i.e. options, futures, swaps) all with differing uses which make it easier or less risky to correct the prices. As far as I'm aware, since bitcoin is so new, there aren't currently any exchanges which support use of these derivatives.

Facts: The general rule of thumb for investment is buy low, sell high. Right now Bitcoin is the highest its ever been.
Speculation (no facts here): BTC is bullish right now, which is a good thing, but that wont last forever. When news stories get out that BTC just broke its USD record, the price will probably briefly become more bullish as people will be trying to cash in. I doubt it'd break $40 in the coming months, and probably not even $35. Within a week I'd guess that the market would turn bearish, and by this time next month I'd guess it'd be back below (or near) $20. Wait until the price drops and stabilizes then buy.
