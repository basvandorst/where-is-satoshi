Unlikely assumption. Get real man.

Oh riiiight! I should've known. Silly me.

Yet all these companies get thread after thread on top of the mainpage with dozen of posts about moon and gentlemen. Every. Single. Time.
They're laughing their ass off all the way to the bank with all the free advertising they get here. This sub wil never learn. 
Blinded by greed and promises of 10k coins they keep falling for the same "scam" over and over again.

All you need to know is that that company exists for one reason: to empty the pockets of Bitcoiners. Their fiat dollars of course because they don't give a crap about Bitcoin itself. 
It no different than pretty much all the other companies in the Bitcoin economy.

And let's not forget how Bitcoin is scammer heaven. 
Edit: downvoted because it isn't true, right?

Bitcoiners are the product. All this data is how they make or will be making money. 
It's everything Bitcoiners are against. But the promise of moon and 10k coins apparantly makes them forget such things. 
We already know how shady the Changetip people are. Spam, bots, fake nicks, you name it. This are the same people that hold all your info. Good luck with this clusterfuck. You're gonna need it.

Uh what?

That means he won't get rich by "hodling" 2 coins. So this likely scenario isn't accepted. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 23:23:38
Do you actually even for a second consider this a plausible scenario? I find that very hard to believe. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 08:33:12
I expected people to say exactly what you said. It's the company's fault and buying stolen cards is perfectly fine. 
Spoken like a true Bitcoiner. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 20:35:15
Kinda odd how it's so quiet in here. I wonder why. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 00:34:50
They don't care. Hardly anybody pays with Bitcoin. It's not worth their time. 
It was nothing but a quick promo stunt to make some extra dollars off Bitcoiners. This sub gave them an insane amount of free advertising. They took their profits and moved on. 
It's always the same story. But you people will never learn. 
Just keep this in mind. Everybody gets rich off Bitcoin except Bitcoiners.

I'm so happy i never touched that shit. This is gonna end so bad. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:45:48
This time it's real. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:59:09
No. Nothing has happened in the last few months and it certainly doesn't start to play a big role there. Who told you it did?
@_date: 2015-05-13 20:55:33
Use some common sense.
