Already did brother. Just bought some Bitcoin on my first market for 420. Then blazed. Then freaked out cause my transaction wasn't withdrawing then I realized I was trying to withdraw the bitcoins from my wallet and not the market :p 
Happy ~420 milestone

Risking commenting on an already -13 comment. Each block was rewarded w 50BTC. Current market price would make it. Roughly $3000-3500. (per block!)

Tldr; It would be just a legality. 
If any money specifically gifted/provided by a government institution were to be used in illegal means (by later blockchain analysis) it could be 'bad' for the college/university. 
In regards to news headlines 'mit gave students money to spend on drugs' and the ramifications to their image.

Tldr; it's currently only profitable to mine if you have free power. (over the long term)

Find their repo, bugtraq. Get into the code base. Start contributing/helping with the latest issues and bugs. 
Once you are fluent with their codebase you can move away from fixing bugs to making features. Hopefully they have a forum or some other type of client rant section to see what the public "wants"(needs), And create pull requests for those features when they are ready to be merged.

Why does it matter? If people give away their money to other uses it's for them to decide. Isn't that part of what we are trying to achieve? Freedom and independance and ability to send and receive money to anyone, anywhere, anytime. 
I have always though of change tip as part of the new 'fossets' where people have the ability to give a little to people that help them out. You watch something on yt, give them a tip for their hard work. Maybe a site doesn't believe in advertisement and you give them a tip. I don't need to go on about the possibilities as I'm sure tones of others on already know the benefits of this awesome system.

Localbitcoins.net is great if you can deposit cash, but it's up to the seller's disgression, as they are taking all the risk with personal bank accounts compared to a real market. 
But some of the people want real names and will call you etc etc as to reduce scams. Tho I have never had this happen.

It possibly could be. Theoretically speaking, 
Depending on how it uses your gov id. This might be the hardest to fake. If it takes a screeny, then easy. 
But if it has some type of rfid/smart card reader then it could be a problem for you. I won't go into how to falsify this. But it could be done. 
And just an anom sim card. Or Google voice? As a way to anonymously receive an sms.

this is VERY similar to the new browser being launched by mozilla's ex-ceo [brave]( who are using BitGO services to provide bitcoin so each person can tip the content creator. where as this is a pay wall and if you don't ~~tip~~  pay in bitcoin (the currency 1% of people use) you cant see the content....
