Only (ONLY! Let me say that again: ONLY! ) reason you see sites like this popping up and people making millions for selling drugs is your utterly broken and retarded "illegal drug" law. 
Legalize it all and see how cartels and dealers vanish. On top of that, you have new source for tax revenue. You can spend that on education, quality control and buy more bombs.

BTC users are in much worst situation than cash or even CC users. 
Q 1: If you want to change USD to EUR, while in Paris, what documents do you need to copy or take picture of so currency exchange can keep your information indefinitely? 
A: None! 
Q: ... but what if you pay in cash for a TV, laptop, furniture etc? 
A: NONE! 
and so on and on 
This whole KYC/AML is bull shit and abused by "businesses" to collect your data for who knows what.

"TransferWise will be out of business in matter of years if Bitcoin was more popular" This is what TransferWise guy said about less than a year ago. 
The fact is, there is still no easy way to put cash (fiat) in from one end and take the same amount of cash out from the other end. Not because of fees but because of volatility, exchanges additional transfers and so on. 
Lets be honest, it's damn slow and expensive task. 
If I send you 1000 EUR in BTC, you have to find trustworthy exchange that can send cash to your bank. This will take days even if it's SEPA transfer in EU. 
BTW, SEPA costs about 0.36 EUR, not 10 EUR, like some exchanges charge you. 
Bitcoin is as much currency as TransferWise network is.

Lets see now. 
I want to send my brother 500 EUR. 
I have 2 options. 
1) Get it done in a day or so via SEAP and pay 0.35 cents or
2) Sign up to BTC exchange, crawl trough all the KYC bull shit, transfer funds to exchange (SEPA), buy BTC, send him BTC and ask him to go trough all that I just did.  
Now, lets say we both have accounts and I got the BTC. 
He still hast to sell BTC and transfer proceeds to his bank. 
There is a 50:50 chance he lost XYZ% in price fluctuations.
There is a third option. Use something like this Estonian bank did. LVH or something. They used coloured coins and allocated 100K EUR to get it going.
I HATE REDDIT formatting bull shit!  FUCK!

You are talking about hoarding :) 
by adoption I mean: becomes useful in commerce as a way to transfer currency. 
No mater what die-hard fanatics are telling you, BTC is not a currency. In this context, cryptocoins is a technology for transferring fiat/money as you do via "wire", SEPA etc. Except it's decentralized (but not for long) and relatively inexpensive, while extremely inconvenient to use.
Problem is, if I send you X EUR worth of coins, by the time you can cash it in, it's value in EUR has probably changed X+- unacceptable %. 
This is why stable price is good. 
Are you willing to do business in Zimbabwean dollars? I hope not :) 
There is another option - coloured coins with fixed value.

Are you sure about this because spending coins becomes almost irrelevant in this case.

If your CEO and CFO are worth their salt, I bet they have already show you the secret recipe for happiness:

It makes way more sense after I read your other post :) 
 
Thank you.

I have no idea. I thought you have to put that picture there some how. :) 
@_date: 2015-07-11 07:27:54
SwagPokerz let me insult you even more. You have obviously failed to understand that if service can be spammed to oblivion with minimal cost, this "service" becomes useless to everything else. 
Who ever is spamming blockchain has probably pointed this out several times before and finally decided to demonstrate it - paint it red and stick it up your ass (right next to your head) so you can see and feel it.
PS! Get some help for your gambling addiction.

This is good news and can become even better news, if local tax authorities start pulling their heads out of their asses and stop harassing EU Bitcoin enthusiasts.

Good one! LOL

Are you sure you are Estonian? Maybe you are just a russian living over there?
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:27:53
Thank you Luke-jr for detailed explanation and example. 
BTW, even  is questionable, because I can ask my rich evil brother to sign the message and pretend, I did it.
But isn't this working in reverse too, making it impossible for evil tax-man to prove you own any coins.
This brings up a new question. How can 1, 2, 3 (from luke-jr) example, be implemented so it cant be abused by someone not in control of the wallet.

I researched this wonderful ID-card not too long time ago. I found out that there is no reliable way to check the votes. So, anyone with access to the system, can (and probably has) manipulate the result.
It's a perfect case where "It's not the people who vote that count, it's the people who count the votes" applies.
(BTW, why is this in @_date: 2015-07-27 19:39:11
how did you measure "times better"? Pulling numbers out of your ass will not qualify :)
We moved a business from Windows to Linux / KDE and after about few weeks, when everyone realized what a load of shit Microsoft's rants about TCO and re-learning really are, productivity started to get better and better.
Small simple features, you never pay attention to, can make a huge difference in productivity and guess what Microsoft has none of those features. 
Enough said. This is getting way off topic, btw.

Actually they did but it was too late. If I recall, Greek finance minister at the time stepped down and that was it.

Yes 
@_date: 2016-02-20 14:23:25
I used wrong word "count". What I actually wanted to say is that there is no way to verify did your vote went to a guy who you voted for. 
Actually, if you look closely, Estonian voting system is a total cluster fuck - you cant really vote a person but the party because votes are transferred to the top guys in the list. At least this is how it works with PM voting. They also use so called "vote magnets" who have no plan to be a part of the parliament but they collect votes to make sure their party members get in. If this is democracy, fuck it. 
It's not as bad as the UK system but it still sucks. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 20:43:51
Voters have no way of knowing but I guess the same problem exists with paper ballot. At the same time, fixing one of those has become really hard because of all the people involved while ID-card or any electronic democracy circus is way easier to fuck with.

Sure. Why not. Do not forget that majority of this billion are absolutely clueless when it comes to OS of any kind.

if you say so. There was another rabid Microsoft fan-boy, who told me it's 39 times better (what ever that means)

I have bad news for most of you. Your ability to type really fast and code some complicated stuff is completely useless when a slimy salesman, like Adam Back, is playing you like a fiddle. 
I have worked with programmers for a very long time and I completely understand how you guys don't get it when Adam Back and his little merry band of sock puppets are selling you all a shit sandwich.
Lets talk about it again in a year.

a lot of wishful thinking and questionable logic.

SwagPokerz, try pulling your head out of you ass. You parroting someone else ideas and confuse yourself thinking it makes you smart or something. LOL 
Because you head is so deep inside of your intestine, you probably fail to understand it.

If you look closely, BTC had been on up-trend from January - this is 4 months, going on fifth!
@_date: 2015-04-30 15:42:24
How did you communicate with them? 
The one who supposed to handle my ticket can't read nor write English. 
They replied in Russian and then sent me a reply: 


:) I am not making this up. 
BTC-e wont let me access account and I cant get my coins out of there.
I wrote about it here:  because I have no idea how to get in contact with them and get my money back. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 13:50:29
... And they deleted my ticket again. 
Is there any other means contacting btc-e? 
@_date: 2015-09-07 16:49:18
This article is a fluff piece.

Stay away from btc-e. 
Don't be surprised, if they lock you out of your account and keep all your coins. Happened to me and it's sucks.

Interesting, because this is exactly what I am looking for. 
Not sure about 13" screen but if it's sold without Microsoft spyware, I am happy and frankly, I am sick of lugging that 17" screen around. 
Maybe smaller is better.

Why do you keep releasing this software? 
It's absolutely unusable unless you have a dedicated computer to run this crap. 
My PC becomes practically unusable when this thing gets started and it downloads absurd amount's of data before you can do anything with it.
I guess "it's all distributed" was just another pipe dream.
