Yeah it depends on a lot of stuff, I have about the same percentage invested though mostly in mining gear pre-orders which is either less risky or even riskier depending on how you look at it.  But for me it's not as risky as it sounds because my income sucked ass the last 12 years- I spent most my time in college and med school making $0 whereas my income will be much higher for 2014, so risking losing even all my life savings isn't a big deal.  I mean I'd still be upset but I wouldn't be financially ruined since I'd still have a good income.  Whereas if bitcoin goes to 10,000 my upside is far greater. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 05:13:39
I'm sad too because I was considering putting in a BTC for laughs at that time and evidently it would have been equal to almost $3 million at current prices (though I'm guessing if you dumped 5% of all NXT to ever exist onto the exchange it'd destroy the price).  Mostly it sounded like a scam to get people to send BTC for no clear reason.

If you really do not know how to obtain your own API keys you really should not be running a bitcoin based business, period.  If you yourself can't handle it you should hire someone who's able to configure this kind of thing.  Honestly anybody even considering starting a bitcoin business should be well versed in dealing with command line interfaces, editing obscure text files, SSHing into random machines, taking apart defective hardware that's been damaged in transit and fixing it yourself, etc.  These aren't consumer retail products!
If you're not technically capable yourself you need to partner with someone who is.  My partner and I both are used to at least basic hardware hacking and he's a software engineer who writes custom scripts and whatnot while I'm also able to configure our *nix systems whether it's a full blown server, a raspberry pi, a beaglebone, or some shady router, even though I'm a friggin physician by training.
Basically, if you would have difficulty setting up your own bitcoin node on your own custom server you should probably not try to deal with any other bitcoin related hardware.  You need to be able to configure your own hardware and troubleshoot hardware problems yourself because there *will* be hardware failures and issues and as a business you'll be the one replacing failing hardware parts because it's not practical to constantly ship problematic hardware back to the manufacturer.  I know other miners who will desolder and reflow mining boards themselves with new mosfets to fix defective boards!
Frankly, you guys got in way over your heads.  If you want to make money off of bitcoin but you're not technically literate you're way better off just buying bitcoins unless you want to either learn all about hardware and software or hire someone who already knows.
There's a reason why a lot of early bitcoin people were IT guys.

I mean it sucks that they didn't tell you but I could see them locking it out if they've been hit with fraudulent purchases, thieves steal banking info all the time and it's pretty easy to buy tons of bitcoins and run off with them with coinbase so they probably just needed verification that it was actually you spending your money.

You don't earn more on the larger pools, their income is more consistent because of the high percentage of blocks they mine but you get the same overall payouts over time.  A very small pool will be very unpredictable but if we split the hash power such that no pool is ever over 5% you'd still get reasonably stable payouts.  What is disappointing is just people don't seem to learn, this has been an issue since deepbit was the largest pool years ago.

Never use anything ever again because nothing is ever going to be absolutely safe.  You do realize that glaring security flaws exist even in open source software right?  OpenSSL would be the most glaring example where even though anybody could review the source code there was a massive flaw right there that nobody noticed.  Are you going to do a thorough code review on every app now by yourself?
Seriously, the really important thing is that companies like Coinbase get insured against customer losses, so that in case there is a flaw found someday you don't lose everything.

The reason is mostly that Amex uses the fees to treat their (usually high spending) customers with typically better rewards, various insurances built into the cards, etc.  I remember I used to own a Compaq laptop once that had the screen go bad after 22 months and Amex basically cut me a check for $1100 because the repair wasn't worth it and junked the laptop for me because they have an extended warranty feature on the card.  Was very pleasantly surprised at how good they were about it but then again I've paid them a shitload in fees over the years.

"For instance, when CT realised that they were to miss their december date, they offered their customers to switch to the January batch for free, that was priced at half the price point."
That's not true cedivad, they let people switch when they dropped the price for the January batch but by the time they realized they weren't going to make their December date they were no longer letting people switch to January.  Instead the December batch people just got an extra unit in March, which is still better than Hashfast but still, they only offered this after quite a bit of wrangling.

The property ruling has made using it as a currency a complete and utter nightmare.  I spent 14 bitcoins today that I had mined and now my accountant has to figure out which fractions were mined on what day, what the price of bitcoin was that day, then basically do dozens of small capital gain and loss calculations, all so I could spend 14 bitcoins.  This is a complete nightmare in terms of actually using bitcoin as a currency.
It was a big boon to early bitcoiners who wanted to cash out millions of dollars, because they got taxed at a lower rate, but in terms of actually using bitcoin as a currency it has made it very difficult.  On top of that, it has forced all the companies that take bitcoin to immediately dump it on the market because they get taxed in dollars based on the price of bitcoin at the time of receipt.
A hybrid model would indeed be best where one could hold it as an investment or use it as a currency but unfortunately current tax laws just don't deal with with it.  To be honest for the future health of bitcoin we should push to have them reclassify it as a currency because while the tax hit is larger it's the only way to help it truly grow long term into a real and globally valid currency.  It's a bitter tax bill pill but one we're going to have to take if bitcoin is to survive.

I don't understand this crazed paranoia...I get that we've all been burned at one point or another by sketchballs in the bitcoin world but all Coinbase did was basically ask a 3rd party developer to write the mobile app...this happens all the time, the only reason you know this time is because he published it under his own developer account.  
@_date: 2014-12-10 12:07:25
To be fair companies like Coinbase do have insurance against losses, and people who hold their own keys also get hacked from time to time unless you put everything in cold storage always so it's not neccessarily safer to hold your own coins versus saving it somewhere like the Coinbase vault.

HFT does not increase volatility except when someone's bot goes nuts-properly done it would actually smooth out price changes since the HFT bots would be boosting liquidity on both ends.  Also, as long as the majority of BTC isn't being traded on a HFT enabled platform it's not a big deal that HFT markets exist-even if a bot went nuts it'd just screw up the pricing on that one exchange.

Actually, more adoption by businesses that sell off the bitcoin immediately on Coinbase or Bitpay just drives the price down as a lot of people will be spending bitcoins mined a long time ago so it's just adding to the supply.
Which is actually a good thing I think, makes it easier for people to still buy bitcoin now or the price would be astronomical.  I think once Bitcoin has it's killer app and has more adoption then all that needs to change is the legal tax treatment to allow people to better hold bitcoin and you'll see the price skyrocket.

All the people who do nothing but hold bitcoins whining about "the miners" are ignoring that miners are the ones putting lots of their own money on the line to secure the network, often not really doing any better than spending the money just buying bitcions but they're the ones doing the important work of securing the network.

While choice is nice I would like to point out to you that the happier you are with your doctor the more likely are you to die sooner compared to peers who are unhappy and the more healthcare dollars you are wasting:
Unfortunately people tend to be happier when their doctors order lots of totally unneeded tests that often have side effects, so in other countries where your doctor is more likely to just tell you to go fuck off if you're unhappy about it, they may actually be doing the right thing in not overtesting or overprescribing, whereas here an unhappy patient will just go find some quack who'll do whatever they want.
It drives me crazy that my girlfriend is one of those patients who'll get super overtested.  She claims it's the doctors making her do all this extra crap that runs up healthcare dollars needlessly but I honestly think it's her since she's constantly being paranoid about having x or y health issue, and she's basically found equally ridiculous doctors that basically overtest to make their patients happy.

Honestly, I'm not sure the time is right yet for an approval.  I'd like to be able to buy more bitcoins somewhat affordable and frankly the ETF will cause a bum rush of speculators just dumping money in blindly without understanding bitcoin.  And these people won't be used to the huge ups and downs of prices in bitcoin and will freak the hell out since they're investing retirement assets and it's all going to make bitcoin look bad.
And since there's basically an ongoing war in bitcoin itself between the big blockers and supporters of segwit it's probably better to wait until that's basically hashed out.  The COIN ETF voting to just go with the blockchain with more hashpower is pretty sketchy, are they just pocketing the other chain during a split?

I honestly have to say that while my Cointerra hardware ended up dying after half a year or so that the hardware was actually relatively well built compared to a lot of other mining equipment.  The server case was overengineered and even the power wiring was well done but the boards themselves had a bad habit of dying.
You haven't seen halfassed until you've opened up a generic Chinese coincraft a1 based miner that's using a wad of masking tape to try and insulate the power board from shorting out on the metal case...
Just glad I bought real hardware from Cointerra and managed to cancel a second order almost a year ago now.  But the writing was long on the wall and I don't know who in their right mind would have bought one of their contracts-they were insanely overpriced for the hashrate so it never made any sense even if they did pay out.  
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:57:02
I just sold 26 of these for $70 each with PSUs so...I would definitely not pay $200.
Of course part of the problem was that we had to sell them ASAP and had a lot of shipping costs if we tried to part them out.
If you really want one I'd aim for about $100-$120 tops and if you're buying in bulk you can get huge discounts

Then you're betting that the market will choose your new algorithm with very little hash rate behind it over the proven existing PoW algorithm with tons of hash rate behind it.  The fork with more hash rate behind it and the original algorithm would be perceived as the safer and less risky one for sure.

Any computer savvy accountant should be able to deal with this though you may need to go over bitcoin regulations with them at some point since not everyone is aware of treatment for specific scenarios (like mined bitcoins).  Keep in mind that if you are actively using or mining bitcoins your accountant will end up spending a LOT of time working on this.  Luckily my accountant is a friend of a friend who did the work for us very cheaply but he spent well over 20 hours doing the numbers so if you are hiring a regular accountant expect things to get expensive if you're actively changing how much you're holding on a daily basis.
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:55:50
This is where you're wrong, bitcoin has value because people use it, but people use it because it's secure.  And it's secure because there's so much hashpower behind it that to compromise it would require an absurd amount of computing power.  So doing a fork that threatens that security would harm bitcoin until there's enough computing power behind the new algorithm to make it truly secure, and that can take a very long time.
And frankly even if you changed algorithms you'd likely just end back where you started, with the people who rush to make the best asics for it controlling everything.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:06:48
Claiming that miners are just a small part of the bitcoin community is pretty absurd.  In the beginning literally the only way to obtain any bitcoin at all was to go and mine them yourself because there was no such thing as an exchange.  Literally all the bitcoin that came into existence has come via mining, and although the block reward has been reduced considerably you forget that a lot of the big early miners are the ones who hold a significant amount of bitcoin.
Even a lot of the developers who are currently not big time miners used to be heavily involved in mining.

Yeah I think 2013 really numbed me to price swings.  If it didn't numb me I might have gone insane, lol.
But unfortunately it also means that I wasn't nearly excited enough when it hit the $230s last year, should have bought more but since I had spent a lot of my savings buying more at $300 I got more fearful than greedy and that hurt.
Honestly I just wish I had more money a few years ago, didn't really start making a much bigger salary until recently.

It'll definitely have an effect since a lot of people are buying just to bet on an ETF approval.  How much of an effect is the question.  I would guess it would dip down to the $800-900 range which is still pretty high all things considered.  There's still some interesting stuff in the pipeline this year so I don't think it would drop too much more than that.
But I do wish it would at least temporarily crash so I can buy some more, lol.  It's so expensive that I can't really afford to buy anything meaningful lol.

FYI hedge funds don't take weekends off so there's nothing special about Monday.  Every Sunday night most hedge funds have lots of workers monitoring overseas markets that have already opened.  Hedge funds stay open whenever their markets are open and sometimes even when their markets are closed, so a bitcoin hedge fund would have someone monitoring things 24/7.  A lot of this is probably already GABI buying back in.

I think you're reading the numbers wrong, over 1% of addresses contain more than 10 coins, it's just that 0.89% contain 10-100, but then all the people who hold more than 100 should also be added since that's still more than 10 coins.  I'm sure they've rounded off the numbers but it looks like 1.01%.
A lot of people control a lot more than one address though since most wallets will have numerous addresses so this has very little correlation to how much bitcoin the wealthier people hold.  Very few people keep a ton of bitcoin all at one address.

I looked through it and it appears to be the best translation so far.  The first paragraph appears to be very accurate.  In fact, I'm not sure why people interpreted it as big pools, he's clearly talking about big blocks vs small blocks.  The characters right after the last colon are: da (big) qu kuai (chunks) bi (will) sheng (win).  So I don't know how anybody could translate this as pools unless they just don't understand mandarin at all, nobody refers to pools as chunks.
The second paragraph can be translated a few slightly different ways but way snruxxns has translated it makes good sense to me. 
And the third paragraph is also a very accurate translation.
My guess is the other translations were by people who are either really shitty at Chinese or possibly more nefariously are trying to manipulate what people think this says, because I can't quite understand how anybody could translate this as being about mining pools-the words aren't even vaguely similar and even if you're bad at Chinese you would presumably use a dictionary and see that it's talking about big blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:31:34
I guarantee you that the Chinese government does not give a shit about this in the least, only people with no clue how China actually functions would think this would rile them up. All their censorship efforts are aimed at the lowest common denominator of Chinese society, essentially uneducated poor people who still think it's ok to poop in the streets and that sort of thing-they're worried that masses of people who don't have much education can be easily swayed by foreign propaganda into a revolt against them. They used to let educated people jump the great firewall all the time, and most hotels in the biggest cities had automatic great firewall bypasses on their wifi networks (like literally on the login page to any Shanghai or Beijing hotel wifi there's a button that says "bypass the great firewall"), but then VPNs became more and more popular and easy to use so they finally decided to block those off.
Information that's as technically difficult to obtain as something embedded in a blockchain will never bother the Chinese government, simple as that. They don't want less educated people to be able to easily obtain information from foreign sources and they have zero worries that some average Chinese person will be able to read any of the stuff people are wasting time and money to embed on the blockchain. To think otherwise is to have drank the kool-aid about China yourself.
I've traveled to China extensively and know people pretty high up in Chinese telecommunications firms and you guys are just wasting your time and money on stuff the Chinese government will never give a shit about. If the government would ever bother to do anything, they'd just see this as a foreign attack against Chinese miners and give them **more** support so at worst you guys are shooting yourselves in the foot with this stupidity and at best you're wasting your money.

I think it'll go below $900, possibly down to $800ish.  But would most likely rebound in time unless there's more bad news on top of this.

lol, Chinese people are well aware of how their government treats Falun Gong members, but since Falun Gong practitioners are very anti-technology I would think they would also be against bitcoin themselves so this would accomplish nothing. The Chinese government also doesn't really care if technically knowledgeable people have access to this information, the reason they censor so hard is to prevent the common person from being exposed to it so they wouldn't give a crap if you embedded all sorts of stuff on the blockchain since only the most technically knowledgeable people could access that information.  Those people can ALREADY access all this stuff because they're technically savvy enough to bypass the great firewall so you're not doing anything. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:36:18
Yeah but if you do that you get no transaction fees and those fees are now very substantial so only idiots would mine empty blocks.  If you're a large and powerful pool the chance of a competing block bumping yours in those few seconds is relatively low and the amount you're losing every single block by not including transactions will be far higher than the rare block where you get bumped.  Back when the reward was higher and fees were lower this may have made financial sense but nowadays it's self destructive to mine empty blocks.

The problem isn't with segwit on a technical level, it's on the leadership abilities of the folks pushing segwit and how they've entirely failed at the politics needed to guide it through without this stupid civil war.  The reality is that a lot of the folks in Bitcoin lack any real people skills, and they might be very talented developers but being able to convince people to follow you is necessary when you're leading what is literally a multi-billion dollar global project.
is right, we need to get everyone on the same page and that requires leadership that isn't enraging half the people who've gotten Bitcoin to this point. I actually think this could have all been avoided had everyone just more or less stuck to the HK agreement in a timely manner, then we wouldn't have any of these threats of hard forks or PoW changes or anything. And now each side has zero trust in the other side, it's really very unfortunate.
I think everyone just needs to have a big get-together and drink a few beers together and play some fucking paintball or something then hash this out with some camaraderie, this shit where everyone just bickers with each other over Twitter is literally getting us nowhere while other cryptocurrencies now actually have a shot at killing the de facto king.

Yeah not doing that.  Last time I sold out at a "high" I ended up having to buy back in at 10x the price with two years worth of my savings while paying the minimum on my student loans so I'd have funds to rebuy my bitcoins.  It worked out obviously, but my cost basis could have been a tiny fraction of what it ended up being.
Now I just add when the price is low, and unfortunately I haven't really been able to add much lately.
My one real regret is that I was very poor when bitcoin first came on the scene so I sold a bunch of mined bitcoins for like $8 each to pay for my radeon.  =(

It's sad but as a Bitcoin enthusiast since the days when Bitcoin was $2.50 I was a maximalist who basically refused to invest in altcoins because I felt that it would lessen the likelihood of Bitcoin eventually succeeding I've now made my first altcoin investments and am going to be getting rid of maybe 20% of my bitcoins to move them into these alts.  Maybe it's the fact that I decided to be a Bitcoin maximalist even though I thought both NXT and Ethereum were very interesting and now I realize that my belief in Bitcoin honestly cost me years of gains.
Now I'm writing a down an investment plan and analysis of various altcoins for 2017 so hopefully I don't miss the next project with a lot of real potential.
I do think Bitcoin will survive even if there is a very contentious hard fork, but the real damage is the psychological damage to people who really believed in Bitcoin and to the general public's belief that Bitcoin is really this immutable and reliable digital store of value.  If all everyone keeps hearing is that people controlling Bitcoin want to dick around with the code in one way or another and nobody can agree which way is correct then no normal person will trust it as a long term store of value.  
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:42:32
A grand or two would have only gotten you maybe 10 grand in profits so if that's all the student loans you have then you're a lucky guy.
I think at the end of the day you have to make your own money and invest it, I mean if I wasn't a broke med student back then I would have probably just bought some but instead I tried to mine some but ended up selling it to pay for the GPU.  Didn't buy most of my bitcoin back until each was many hundreds of dollars each so you're not really much worse off than me if you buy now.

The insult is usually "you turtle egg" and it's just a colloquialism meaning "you bastard".
It is pretty common to say "fuck your mom" as an insult in Chinese though, it's their equivalent of "fuck you", and there's a lighter variant that basically means the same thing that's equivalent to "fuck!" for when you screw something up or something bad happens.
But people definitely say this a lot more in China so it's not quite as crazy as it sounds in English.  Like if you're drunk with a bunch of friends and talking shit you'll probably hear people say this a bunch but it's not always meant to be super insulting.
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:38:12
Yeah all that would happen is that miners would develop an ASIC for the new CPU algorithm.  Or at the very least people would deploy FPGA based mining farms to get the energy cost down right away, while working on an ASIC version.
There's no way to make an algorithm that's fully ASIC proof, the best you can do is make it difficult for current ASICs to run the algorithm by taking advantage of some specific weakness (like how scrypt required a lot of memory and memory bandwidth so GPUs were naturally equipped for it) but it's a delay more than anything long term.

If you have a job and you scrounge every last penny you can do it, it's just harder and harder.  That's what I did to get back into bitcoin, I paid the minimum on my student loans and scrounged every last penny from my salary to put into bitcoins and mining equipment.  Everyone thought I was insane since I was letting my student loans pile up interest at 6.8%, and frankly it was probably a horribly risky decision but I knew I'd be finished with residency in a few years and eventually be able to pay off the loans anyways.
Don't really recommend doing this but if you want to achieve it with a normal salary you can.  
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:47:35
Honestly part of the problem is just that mining tends to be centralized where people can rapidly develop ASICs and have access to cheap power, but it's certainly possible for non Chinese firms to develop good ASICs (see Bitfury for example), it just takes a lot of money and willpower.
I do think more ASIC companies coming back would be a good idea, it's just VERY difficult to be competitive and many have tried and failed.
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:42:17
If you do all the verifications you can request an increased limit and they'll allow ACH's of up to $15000 per week, though above that you will need to do wire transfers.  I think their wire limit is $500K but you would still have a buy limit per week from the wired in money that may be different than how much you wired in.  So like if you wire in $500K you might only be able to spend half that, depending on what your cash balance limit is. 
But the deposits are only FDIC insured up to $250K anyways, so probably not a good idea to wire more than $250K in.

Why are you assuming that these should be compared to card not present transactions?  Bitcoin is accepted by stores where the equivalent transaction with a credit card is a physical swipe.
If you go to a cafe that takes bitcoin and you spend $3.74 it's the equivalent of a swipe transaction, not a card not present transaction.
Secondly, most large retailers will pay approximately the Visa interchange fee and not the high numbers you're quoting with Paypal, with their banks providing this as a service in return for all their other banking needs going through them. The largest retailers will end up directly paying Visa processing fees because they have partner banks etc. that issue their own store cards, etc.  But even if you're a mom and pop shop you can easily beat the very high Paypal rates you're quoting here with merchant accounts.  Costco's partner credit processor for Costco members charges 1.22% plus 12 cents a swipe for example, though the online rate is indeed much higher at 1.99% plus 25 cents, but that's because it's not a processor that offers a special small transaction rate.  Amazon payments offers a small transaction fee for online payments that would be 5 cents plus 5% so even for a pure online transaction that's the same fee as this Bitcoin transaction.  Except for the Bitcoin transaction you don't have the option of the lower fee for in person transactions, it's the same fee.

A lot of these things are controlled by algorithms now, even their CSRs can't tell you why.  It's just whenever your pattern of behavior matches what the algorithms have seen scammers do in the past.  Don't take it personally lol.  Their security is also top notch, it looks at the access IP and the cookies on the computer to make sure it's likely to be you and not someone else and then needs 2 factor on top.  That's the only annoying thing as well, it's easy to lock yourself out of you're a long term holder since your IP changes and you could have cleared your cookies and forgotten the password lol

Stop overpaying the fees...I moved much larger amounts to consolidate my dust for much less just by being patient.  Every fee was under $1 even for relatively complex transfers.

You'll end up with gigantic income tax bills if you do that while bitcoin is going up in price because the constant buying and selling of bitcoin will result in you constantly racking up short term capital gains taxes which are taxed at income tax rates at least in the US.
That's why very few people can actually use this as a currency, it's a tax and accounting nightmare. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:44:48
Don't bother, even with Segwit the goal is eventually to have higher fees than they are right now so $1 will become unspendable.  At a minimum I'd send her a few hundred bucks and even then that [wouldn't be spendable in the future](
If you want such small amounts it'll have to be on a LN from the get go.  Which is why there's such an angry war between people supporting different visions of the future of Bitcoin.

As someone who's held for a very long time, don't assume that just because you purchased at a lower price that the price won't drop below that.  I spent a lot of money on equipment and power/hosting and mined most of my coins at a cost to me of about $500 each.  Then the price dropped so I averaged myself down by buying more at $300 and gave myself an average price of about $400 a coin.  Then it fell to $200 a coin and I thought about averaging down further but honestly ran out of conviction that it wouldn't just drop to $100.
Until we get larger volumes globally it'll continue to be an insanely volatile currency, and between the fears in China and larger whales trying to cash out at a pretty good price I suspect it'll be painful for quite a while.
A little bummed I didn't sell any this time around when it went past $1K though.

Isn't the problem mostly that the LN operator would be heavily centralized?  I mean you're basically describing Venmo or Paypal and there's a 100% chance the government would want to regulate someone operating a LN.  There has to be a LN operator who's paying the on chain fees, etc. for running the LN, so at the end of the day the question is how is this better than using a trust based setup if you're still dependent on the LN?

Yeah, like ZenNate explained it's all First In First Out so if you first bought your bitcoins a while ago for $600, every time you spend some when it's valued at $900 you'll be paying income taxes on the $300 difference even if you go out and buy the same amount amount of bitcoins for $900.
The worst scenario is that bitcoin then drops back to $600, because now you still owe incomes taxes, unless you sell the same amount at the new money losing price to record a loss for yourself.
Someone who holds it longer term (over a year) would instead qualify to just pay capital gains tax rates on any increase in the value of their bitcoin, which is much lower than income tax rates.  For some people it can be as low as 0%, while most will pay 15% and the very well off will pay 20%.
So constantly buying and selling bitcoins as the price is rising is basically just generating a gigantic tax bill for yourself that's anywhere from twice as much money to infinite times the taxes (if you would have qualified for the 0% long term rate)

Why are you making daily wires to exchanges?  Regardless of whether you're buying bitcoin or not, most personal bank accounts will be closed if someone is doing that kind of wire volume or even ACH transfer volume.  I don't know of any bank that would let you do this with a personal account regardless of what you're using the money for.
If you professionally arbitrage across exchanges then you likely need a very different kind of bank account than a personal checking account.

You owe taxes on how much it was worth the day you accepted it, so for example right now Bitcoin is $4300 and if you sell a computer for $4300, you get one Bitcoin.  For the sake of calculations let's say your profit that you owe taxes on is $2000.  Now Bitcoin goes into a bad bear market and drops in price to $1000-it's very possible, just 8 months ago it was less than that.
Now not only did you sell a computer that was worth $4300 for essentially $1000, you still owe the IRS taxes on your profit of $2000 that they record the day you receive the Bitcoin even though you're only holding $1000 worth of Bitcoin. Not only that, you're also out the computer.  If you don't sell the Bitcoin at that point you cannot claim a loss of any sort, you just have $1000 worth of Bitcoin but a tax liability on the $2000 profit (which would vary depending on what structure your business is but could be as high as $800 if you're a sole proprietor in a high tax bracket). You're right in that if you sold the Bitcoin at a loss you could then claim a capital loss and avoid paying taxes, though in that case you've locked in for yourself a loss of $3300 vs just accepting USD, so I don't see how that's particularly helpful for any business that needs to not go bankrupt.  Overstock can only hold 50% of their BTC payments in BTC because they barely get any payments in BTC-no business could risk actually holding 50% of their total incoming payments in BTC unless their business is just speculating on Bitcoin, because a downturn would not only wipe out your profit margin but it would leave you with a tax liability.
BTW, I own a couple businesses and have had to deal with the headache of how Bitcoin is taxed in the US for quite some time-I think my accountant didn't realize how much of a headache it would be when he agreed to deal with this lol.

Yes, let's make up straw man arguments about credit cards by exaggerating the fees.  The reality is that credit card companies offer a different fee structure for small purchases like a $3.74 transaction.  
In fact both Visa and Mastercard charge only 1.55% plus $0.04 for transactions under $15 for regular credit cards, and even on higher fee cashback/points rewards credit cards the Visa fee is 1.65% plus $0.10.  You can actually look at Visa's fee tables right [here]( where it's listed as the "Small Ticket" rate.
In other words, on a $3.74 transaction the merchant would only pay 10 cents for most credit cards and for reward credit cards the merchant would pay 16 cents (in that case the consumer would get points that reflect the difference in fees).  Both are far cheaper than the 23 cents OP paid, and nowhere near your claim of the fee being 41 cents on a $3.74 credit transaction.
The credit card companies offer these lower fee structures on small purchases because they want people to use credit cards for purchases of all sizes, so they can make money off of interest and fees.

Not for a while since your Bitcoins would have to be moved to a segwit address and the exchanges would have to support it.  So you're looking at months to years before the places you're using Bitcoin properly support Segwit to use the added space.

Except it won't be considered an altcoin by anybody outside of this subreddit, segwit2x has the support of multiple exchanges as well as majority hashpower so all that would happen is that segwit2x would be listed as bitcoin on the supporting exchanges while the 10% hashpowered non-2MB fork would be listed as something else on the exchanges.  Like BitSW or something, much like BCash.  You can post about how it's an altcoin all day long but it wouldn't matter what you post since the exchanges that signed up would consider it the true Bitcoin.

A lot of segwit supporters want fees to go up more to force people to use the second layer solutions. That way they can make money providing those second layer solutions. [Here's a good example]( of the fees they're thinking about.
Segwit will only lower fees when you move your coins to a Segwit address and then onto a Lightning Network. And their goal is to make the traditional transactions very expensive so nobody will do them, except of course this will wipe out anybody with small balances of Bitcoin because the fees will make those Bitcoin worthless and unspendable.
Honestly, if you have a lot of dust consolidate it when the mempool is clear and keep and eye out on the future or you may wake up one day to find that they consider your small transactions spam and have made fees so high that you can't spend any of your Bitcoin.  That's why you see these lunatics post nonsense about how it's OK for the fees to eat up 90% of the transaction-they think that's perfectly fine, except it might just eat up 100% of your entire bitcoin wallet balance down the line.
I've bit the bullet and have been paying a bunch of money in fees to consolidate all my old coins to deal with this future scenario, and I would strongly recommend that if you have what they would consider a meaningful amount of bitcoin that you do the same.  If you don't, then you should keep an eye out on the fee situation.

The real question is how long before the chain would be secure with a new PoW algorithm, not how quickly you could roll out a new algorithm.
And then the second question you should ask is how long before the mining power against centralizes amongst the few companies skilled enough to make an efficient ASIC for this new algorithm.
And then the third question is then, which companies do you think those would be?
If you answer all these questions you'd pretty quickly understand why this is a lousy solution.  All a PoW change would accomplish is to 1)Destroy the security of the blockchain in the interim, 2)again centralize the hashrate amongst asic producers, 3)most likely centralize it back to the same companies that currently make the ASICs. To permanently get rid of the influence of miners you would need to switch to a PoS or similar system, but that would basically make Bitcoin something that is entirely not Bitcoin.

You won't know how much bitcoin is in the wallet until you fully sync the blockchain.  Well, that's not true, you can look at the public addresses as it's syncing and look up the balances on publicly available websites as well.

For the USA your only other choice is Coinbase, which also supports 2X.  So you won't have a choice in the US in terms of payment processor.  2X has the backing of the miners and the major payment processing systems and several large exchanges across multiple continents.
This is why I find it ridiculous when people post here that they're going to "dump 2x" for core's version of segwit, if the exchanges and payment processors view 2x as the true Bitcoin then your angry reddit posts won't mean much.

You could buy your own mining hardware and make a fork whenever you feel like. The reason why it doesn't make sense to do so is that such forks without significant hashpower aren't secure-anybody with 51% of the total hashrate of your fork can manipulate it and attack it. So the people downplaying the risks of insisting on staying on a minority hashpower fork aren't being honest with you. Bitcoin Cash isn't a secure fork right now, and if Segwit 2X and Segwit 1MB have significantly different hash rates then the one with a lot more hashrate behind it will be secure while the other one will be an insecure altcoin. A lot of core supporters don't want to believe this, but if there's no hashrate behind your blockchain it isn't a secure blockchain.

You'll have to explain where all those extra BTC came from, and you might actually owe taxes because taxes are not calculated on the final sales value of your Bitcoin, they're calculated every single time you've made a trade between bitcoin and the other currency depending on if your bitcoin was up or down versus when you bought it at that time.  You'll have to match it by first in first out accounting as well.
And of course if you explain to the IRS that you got these extra bitcoins by trading altcoins get ready to be able to produce all the tax records for those altcoin gains.  Every single time you've ever sold for a profit you'll owe income taxes on those profits.  You can't just sum it up at the end like you're thinking you can.
It is actually possible to end up owing the IRS more money than all the Bitcoin you have left if you don't watch what you're doing.  It's unlikely to encounter this situation right now because bitcoin is up, but if the price of bitcoin fell to say, $200 you could have a tax bill that's several times what your Bitcoins are worth in total.
For example, if you buy 1 Bitcoin when it was $200. Then when Bitcoin hit $1000 you exchanged the Bitcoin for Ethereum.  To the IRS you've just made $800 and owe capital gains on that $800.  Let's say you made that exchange before one year had elapsed.  You'd owe the full income tax rate on that coin, up to 40% if you're very well off.  So now you owe them $800*0.40=$320.  Now let's say the value of all the Etherum you hold has dropped to $200 because Ethereum went down in value.  Guess what?  You still owe the IRS $320 and they don't care that your Ethereum is only worth $200 now, in their eyes you had an $800 gain when you sold out of your Bitcoin position and you owe them money on that.
But honestly, you shouldn't be trading in and out of positions if you don't know the tax consequences of what you're doing.  This is why so many people just hold the coins, it's a gigantic tax nightmare if you do anything else with Bitcoin.  And mining is a gigantic headache too, you have to figure out the price you mined every fractional bitcoin every day at.

Bitcoins are much more traceable than you think, so even though you can steal the Bitcoins trying to ever cash them out or spend them without being caught is another matter entirely. Even that dumbass FBI agent couldn't cover his tracks and he's an FBI agent.
A lot of people also store their Bitcoins in things like a Coinbase vault so even if you want to rob them of their Bitcoins it'd take days and they'd be long reported kidnapped before you ever get access to a single Bitcoin.
But yeah sure, for maximum security never tell anybody about Bitcoin.

The problem is not the speed, that's annoying but still possible to deal with just by waiting it out. The real problem is that a chain missing that much hashrate is not secure at all, it can be very easily 51% attacked just like any of the SHA256 altcoins. Just look what [happened to all these coins](
If a majority of hashpower is mining Segwit2X BTC then any other variant of BTC becomes worthless because it is by definition not a secure blockchain.  It's very simple, if you do not have majority hashpower your blockchain is NOT secure. Bitcoin Cash is NOT a secure chain for this very reason. But you can't just wish that chain you like has hashpower and is secure, if it's not secure it's not secure no matter how you wish it were otherwise, and a chain without good security would not be worth much money.

If you have your own wallet you can force lower fees IF the inputs to your wallet are simple.  For more complex transfers the minimum fees to ever get mined can still run you more money. But I moved some pretty complex inputs made up of some dust the other day for like $1 total in fees, just took about 16 hours to mine. That said, I found that with very low fees I had a lot of issues with nodes basically refusing to relay the transaction so my transactions were only seen by a few nodes for hours and hours.  And interestingly some miners took a larger total transaction with a lower per kb fee over a smaller transaction with a higher fee per kb.

If you're a US based business that wants to accept Bitcoin your only two choices are both backing Segwit2X.  Sure, you could directly accept Bitcoin, except then you're screwed from a tax perspective if the price of Bitcoin fluctuates because the IRS will demand payment of taxes based on the price on the day you accepted it so you can end up owing more income taxes than the total amount of Bitcoin you hold. It's happened in the past when Bitcoin dropped from $1000 to $200, so almost all businesses either sell all of it for USD right away or hold only a small percentage in Bitcoin like Overstock does. It would be completely irresponsible for any business to only hold it in Bitcoin because they would risk completely wiping out their business if the price moved lower.  So when the two major US processors both only process segwit2x there's really no other choice.
You can yell about not using Bitpay all you want on reddit but unless you go and make a payment processor that backs Segwit1MB no business can stop using Bitpay unless they want to just stop accepting Bitcoin entirely.

Unlikely because of how the difficulty curve works.  The only miners who do it profitably buy their hardware bulk at heavy discounts or manufacture the ASICs themselves.
Everyone else either gets scraps by being bulk buyers or screwed.
The only good thing about mining is that it essentially makes you average into bitcoin on a daily basis.  That's the only reason I regret giving up on mining because I was actually losing money paying for electricity and cooling.  So I went from averaging in around $500 to just not buying any new Bitcoin which was a huge mistake in hindsight.  Most people who mine also have to sell their bitcoins to pay for hosting and power so long story short, don't mind unless you have 1)very cheap power and 2)the funds to buy in bulk

It's because the people posting this stuff on twitter and here are 100% Core supporters so to them anything that isn't made by Core is automatically "not Bitcoin" regardless of whether or not everyone else agrees that it is. They basically insist that because Core has been behind most of the software in recent years that by default only software they've written can be Bitcoin.

Well this is what happens when everyone stays in their own echo chambers, just hearing other people reinforce the same things you already believe in over and over makes everyone into an extremist for one side or the other.  The fact that people ended up splitting into different subreddits or forums or websites where everyone just espouses one viewpoint means that people will continue to get further and further apart on what they think the future of bitcoin should be.
It's too bad, at this point it's probably too late to fix this split since any dissenting opinions will get downvoted to oblivion on either subreddit.

It takes far more money and time to be a miner than it does to maintain a node.  If you want to increase support for what you want then you can become a miner too.  I spent a lot of my own money renting out a data center and constantly buying new equipment just to end up having to pay more than it would have if I had just bought the bitcoins the regular way.  And I had to pay a giant tax bill for all my efforts because every day you mined anything it's taxed immediately as income.
You're free to put in the effort to change how miners are voting by actually putting money into mining.  That takes a lot more work than just whining on a subreddit, but that's also why the miners get to decide things, they're the ones putting a lot of time, effort, and money into securing the blockchain.
If I lived somewhere with less idiotic tax regulations and cheap electricity I might still have been a miner but it ended up being a gigantic waste of money compared to if I had just bought bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:06:48
Because Core supporters' vision of Bitcoin in the future involves [heavy fees on the main chain]( with most transactions only occurring on LN, so any increase in the main block size would slow down adoption of their vision. That's why you see some people suggesting even smaller block sizes like 300K.
I'm not sure either vision of Bitcoin in the future is necessarily wrong, but they're definitely very different.

The petty squabbles are pretty much unavoidable since you have a bunch of nerds who may or may not have an autism spectrum disorder arguing with each other over the internet along with huge egos.  It's even worse when someone who mined a lot early gets rich because then it drives their ego to brand new heights.
At least this squabble isn't hurting adoption, I've seen people insist on ranting and raving in ways that honestly makes bitcoin look bad.

Actually GDAX covers the network fee for you, much like Coinbase used to before the fees got out of control.  The fees used to be a few cents so they didn't really care.
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:04:35
Because if you go back to the beginning, almost all Bitcoiners were miners themselves because that was the primary way of obtaining Bitcoin at first. Everyone saw it as their responsibility to help mine and secure the network for this crazy experiment of theirs, and they thought of it as a distributed computing experiment in addition to being an economic experiment.
 
I don't know of any early Bitcoiners (let's say 2009-2011) who weren't also miners at some point.
Now obviously the state of things is quite different than those early days, but if you're wondering why many still revere mining it's because it was seen as a critical part of the duties of believers in Bitcoin. Everyone could only run full nodes anyway back then, and even the dedicated ASIC mining companies initially distributed hash power out to consumers who could mine at a profit. But obviously selfish behavior quickly took over and we're where we are today.
I honestly miss those days when folks were gullible enough to crowdfund ASIC companies who they genuinely believed would evenly distribute hashpower instead of hoarding the ASICs for themselves while giving people scraps. Folks were more idealistic and thought everyone would just collaborate and share the wealth in this revolution. But most of the more idealistic folks lost a lot of money to their naive beliefs.
Anyways, long term I really hope we get an open source ASIC that actually succeeds.

I honestly don't think his current work and his past statements are in contradiction or require flip flopping. You can believe that a hard fork is a nuclear option and still feel that you need to do it because you disagree with the other implementation strongly enough that you feel you have to use the only option left. You can also similarly believe that fees are needed to prevent people abusing the blockchain as cheap storage, while also feeling that fees shouldn't become excessively expensive on the main chain either because you may simply believe that people should continue to be able to transact on the main block without needing to resort to LN-just with fees that are high enough to prevent abuse but not high enough to prevent use.
Really, none of these quotes show any flip-flopping at all.  Just because you don't believe having hashrate equals knowing the right way to steer the future of Bitcoin doesn't mean that you have to agree 100% with Core.

The people on this subreddit is not "the community at large", it's literally a group of redditors who like Bitcoin.
The people who actually hold large sums of Bitcoin are the ones you're ranting against who are behind Segwit2x. That's why they have the actual economic majority, not only do they have the miners who have collected HUGE sums of Bitcoins over the years, they have the largest Bitcoin based businesses who also have collected huge sums of Bitcoin. So your argument is basically that people should back the fork that a bunch of redditors want over the one that people with billions of dollars of capital invested into exchanges, processors, and mining firms. Why should anybody listen to you?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:45:11
Sure but literally everyone has funds in legacy addresses now, so at a minimum you still have to pay a fee to move it into a segwit address first to get the lower fees, and then still pay the new lower fee to send it.  So if OP just wants lower fees on a transaction it's not likely to be cheaper for a while because for people to benefit from the new segwit space a lot of folks have to move all their funds over to segwit addresses first. Even if you wanted to do it with your own funds it wouldn't really result in savings anytime soon since you'd be paying to move literally all your bitcoins over to a segwit address which would cost you legacy fees.  It's not really cheaper to send all your existing bitcoins over to a segwit before spending them since you're still paying the legacy fee first anyway-you're just paying a legacy fee and then a segwit fee if you do that.
The legacy fees will only go down after a bunch of people are using the segwit space, and exchanges have moved to the segwit space for their large volume of transactions, then that'll take pressure off the legacy space.  There might even be a brief spike in legacy transaction costs if everyone is trying to move coins to segwit addresses.

If this story is true this sounds like a targeted attack, I would find it very unlikely that people just randomly saw six words in someone's Evernote account and knew to log into some VM for the other half of the seed.  Someone clearly knew that he had bitcoin and went after his Evernote account.

If I hadn't sold the original bitcoins for a few bucks I'd definitely be a millionaire but hindsight and al that.

I don't think you understand how these graphs are calculated-they're based on block times, which means they only average out to what the true hashrate is...if there's bad luck it'll look like there's less hashrate when there is actually the exact same amount of hashrate.

Electrum enforces a minimum fee that you can't override, on the desktop I believe you can set it pretty low, but if your balance is made up of a bunch of smaller inputs like from mining a long time ago, your fees can still be very high.  I recently tried to send some coins and Electrum defaulted to a $150 fee so I suspect you're running into a similar problem.  I had to wait until congestion cleared to put through the minimum fee transaction.
As the fees go up most of these smaller wallet balances will essentially be wiped out since they'll be unspendable and what some developers consider "spam" transactions, so if you have smaller wallets it's a good idea to consolidate them into one larger address for future spending when the fees are low because in the future only very large transactions will make sense on the main chain with everyone else basically forced into lightning for transactions.
Try to lower the fees if you can to the lowest and send it, the default fee is likely above what your balance is.
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:56:26
Depends on for how long...if the BCH price remains stable at what it is now and the mining difficulty adjusts eventually economic pressures will force miners to mine BCH, because hardware prices go up against the most profitable thing you can mine with it.
If BCH can keep their price up long enough they will eventually attract more miners.  Shift the equation enough and BCH may achieve similar levels of security.

This may not be true, the exchange people use for real estate may well apply to Bitcoin as it can be applied to multiple other commodities in addition to real estate.  So people can swap between livestock for example in addition to real estate.  The only requirement is that you hold said property for investment purposes and not as inventory.
The IRS might fight you but the way the rules are written right now do not rule this out.
But honestly the safest thing to do is to avoid excessive trading should the IRS disagree.

IOTA is unusable crap right now that absolutely does not deserve its ridiculous market cap, the market cap is only this high because they multiplied the supply literally by millions and people are too retarded to understand that.  I regularly see comments where they don't even know what a MIOTA is.  The only real winners are people who bought in at the ICO or on Yandex before this bubble.  Funny thing is, I found out about it a week after the ICO, and thought it had potential. Problem is that it isn't well implemented right now and it's more of an academic exercise than a really usable product which makes the market cap mind boggling.
99.9% of IOTA holders have never actually use the software they've "invested" in.  Bitcoin is actually usable, Ethereum is more or less usable, and even in the DAG world Byteball is FAR more polished.

Honestly if you're making that many transactions you're at risk of getting your account shut down.  It's not even that it's with Coinbase, any personal checking account that's getting a high volume of ACHs out is going to get flagged as suspicious.  They don't want people doing business with personal accounts, etc.
I honestly don't know why you would buy buy $592 on 8/26 then buy $8 more on 8/29 and $8 more on 8/30.  Stick to the big purchases and try to just do it once or twice a month or it'll look extremely suspicious regardless of where you were transferring the money to, because people just don't usually transfer money like that.

This is seriously some conspiracy theory silliness though, all DCG did was spread money around all over the place and invest in basically almost all the Bitcoin startups back in the day.

Most miners use Bitmain hardware so they'd benefit from ASICBOOST?  It also doesn't make you more likely to mine an empty block btw, except in that you can mind blocks faster so if you get two back to back the pools like to race to the finish by keeping the second block empty.
For a long time the other hardware suppliers didn't sell much of their hardware so most independent miners became very dependent on antminers.

The problem is that while they're great at attacking the folks trying to write a 2MB solution, they had years to work on this code themselves and support a compromise that everyone could be happy with.  But instead Core insisted on essentially not working on it at all.  Nobody would even have needed to get together all these companies to make an alternative if they had actually been responsive to the rest of the ecosystem, and to spin it as an evil VC plot is beyond idiotic. If you're invested in the Bitcoin ecosystem to this degree you want it to thrive and function well for all the companies working with it, so their incentives are entirely aligned with Bitcoiner's. The fact that Core constantly feels the need to attack anybody else trying to improve things is tiresome and frankly shows a lack of leadership.

Can't really blame them it's difficult for a company like coinbase to collect BCH without basically risking their overall security system by having to basically move so many cold storage coins.  Not really worth the risk of destroying their security.  I think if BCH sticks around and becomes very valuable or stays valuable they'd probably end up working on a secure system to split the coins they hold but rushing is a bad idea.

If the non 2x fork has little hashrate behind it and becomes worthless there no way Coinbase would support it, especially in this situation without replay protection the minority fork would be unusable.
You also have no right to continue to use their exchange so if they tell you in advance they're not supporting your fork you can sue all you want but they don't owe you any services.  Like you said, you're free to move your coins elsewhere.  
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:19:23
No you owe the capital gains on the rise in value of your fees versus when you obtained the bitcoin as the IRS considers spending any bitcoin on anything to be the equivalent of selling it. That said, you can usually round to the nearest dollar for taxes so if you paid 20 cents in fees in a year it rounds to 0.
I would recommend not paying crazy high fees though, because you would technically owe taxes on it.
Now if you're investing in bitcoins as a business venture you can deduct off the fees you've paid as an expense, which will counteract the capital gains taxes you're supposed to pay on the fees.  
Speaking of which, the default wallet fees are way too high for most wallets.

Most people are horribly overpaying on fees, almost every transaction I've sent that's been slightly over 1 satoshi/byte has confirmed within a few blocks and I even got a fairly small but high value transaction through at **under** 1 satoshi/byte though it did take a few hours (wouldn't recommend it though since most of these will get stuck for days). The problem is that the average fees people are paying are very high because the wallets are using fee logic from when Bitcoin was a much cheaper coin, so they're all defaulting to huge sums of money. I find this particularly obnoxious with mobile wallets-many seem to default to paying 10x what you need to actually get a transaction through. I would honestly pay just a little over 1 satoshi/byte if you're not in a hurry, most of these will get mined within a few blocks anyway.

[This is what happens if the chain doesn't have majority hashpower behind it]( It becomes incredibly easy to attack and destroy it.
All the people who want to treat Bitcoin as a digital store of value would abandon it if it could be modified by an attack at any time, and that's exactly what it would be if it doesn't maintain the majority hashrate of SHA256 miners. You could try to fork off to another algorithm or PoS but the security would not be as good for a long time to come, it's taken many years for Bitcoin to build up enough hashrate that it's essentially impossible to attack. But if all that hashrate is on the Segwit2X chain then that's the chain that'll be secure and difficult to attack.
You can do whatever you want with your money, but if it's not secure nobody will treat it as a digital equivalent to gold.

90% of miners and some of the biggest exchanges in the world agree that the 2x coin is the real bitcoin, so everyone here insisting on that the segwit only coin is the real Bitcoin is basically insisting that a coin with minority hashpower is the true Bitcoin, which has simply never been the case.  And honestly, if Coinbase and Korbit and BTCC all list the segwit coin as an altcoin, or don't even release the split coin until months later like Coinbase is doing with BCH then it'll make it very difficult for the segwit only coin to survive with mainstream adopters.

Honestly the problem is if Bitcoin really becomes what some of the small blockers want then everyone will be forced to hold most of their Bitcoins in centralized lightning channels and such. You can't really blame people for becoming very angry and fearful when small blockers are saying [insane things like how fees should be $1000 per tx](
I'm for Segwit but I'm also for having enough space on the main blockchain and/or segwit space that you can still transact larger transactions without those larger transactions having to be millions of dollars, otherwise everyone would have to trust their security to LN nodes which is insanity, we might as well just all use Coinbase then since you've just ruined the entire point of a distributed cryptocurrency.
I honestly think Segwit2x is a reasonable compromise.  Fees maybe can be higher on the main chain but they should still be reasonable enough that normal people can afford to move their savings around on the main blockchain, if fees were $1000 how would anybody outside of the wealthiest countries with the most cash be able to use the main blocks at all?  The main block needs to grow enough to keep the fees on something like a $1000 transaction under 1%.
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:10:59
No the reason is that cash is a pain to process, big retailers have to literally hire someone to go move the sacks of cash to the bank every few hours so the credit card fees that reduce the need for that actually don't increase their overall cost.  You're being purposefully obtuse.

But we should definitely listen to a redditor who's been here all of 6 weeks about how segwit2x has only support from "chinese miner and Bitpay" who doesn't even understand that there's no replay protection for the minority fork here.  There's no free money, you're going to pick your poison and if you pick a fork with minority hashrate it will be an insecure fork.

It is pretty strange to make it sound like Venmo, Quickpay, Paypal, and Google Wallet don't exist.  In the real world people tend to ask me to use one of these to pay them or pay me back with only a few bitcoin enthusiasts ever requesting bitcoin.  One person requested bitcoin in order to get some to hold and then lost their wallet despite me warning them many times that with bitcoin they really have to store their wallets carefully (though this was a while back before it became much more convenient).
As of right now Bitcoin is terrible for quick person to person transactions.  It's only real beneficial use case is if you need to send money across international borders, in which case it is still cheaper than a bank wire and has genuine utility.

No, because the exchanges require multiple confirmations and have a copy of the existing blockchain.
Even if you obtained &gt;51% of the hashpower and changed the blockchain the exchange would know that the changed blockchain was an attack since they have the original blockchain.

Mining costs almost the same as just buying most of the time. The only upside is that you're always averaging your cost.
Also, I don't get how you feel that Bitcoin is a scam because it's "printing your own money" but it's OK for governments to print all the money they want without limit? At least with Bitcoin you know what the limit is, you know what the inflationary rates are. With government issued currency they can literally change their minds at any time and start printing whatever they want until the currency is literally worthless, which makes saving money very difficult.
I don't think Bitcoin can be the only answer though, there's some good arguments to have inflationary currencies to promote spending, but certainly having Bitcoin as an option for hedging against excessive inflation is very useful so you don't end up a zimbabwean trillionaire.

And right now EV penetration is still &lt;1%, though I expect it to rise to a little over 1% if the Model 3 sells as well as the preorders indicate.

You are crazy if you think that one of the largest economies, and what is the  economy in terms of overall population savings by far backing out of Bitcoin is good for it. People in the US have higher incomes but they also have far more debt than Chinese people who tend to have a very high ratio of savings to income-which is why people in China will invest money in lots of very speculative assets including cryptocurrency. But the day when we would come up against government hostility has been coming for a long time.
What we need now is to get the Chinese government to see the benefits to them, or we may face a domino effect where other governments follow with heavy handed insanity like this.

Yeah but over half my portfolio is from new investments I made with cash this year even though I was already very heavy into Bitcoin, the new investments were comparatively small but since one of them was Qtum the returns quickly swelled crypto into being over 90% of my net worth. I probably will diversify out a little at some point and do have other investments but I think there's still a lot of room to run for crypto.  And for a lot of people including myself, selling out now triggers a MASSIVE tax bill, if I sell the newer gains I'm looking at a 46% income tax bill because My base income tax bracket is so high.  Your diversification strategy may not make sense for a lot of holders with large positions.
The other thing is that I can afford the risk.  My regular job pays well into the six figures so even if I lost every single penny I put into crypto I'd be fine financially.  Probably not mentally lol.
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:45:32
If you have enough I'd just cash out a portion as it hits certain long term price targets. But if you think about it, as it goes higher and higher you don't really need to sell very much to get a bunch of money out to lock in those profits. So you could sell 20% at $10K, 20% at 25K, 20% at 50K, 20% at 75K, etc. Even though you have less and less Bitcoin because the price is constantly higher you're getting more money out of it still at each step.
This is probably a safer strategy than just holding 100% until 100K, but if you don't need the money it really doesn't matter anyway.

Being tiny right now is not helpful, Bitpay is supporting segwit2x because people stopped buying stuff with bitcoin and they saw their volumes tank due to the high fees.  A lot of the lowered volumes now are because people still think the fees are high, which is the case with a lot of wallets and web wallets-they're still calculating sky high fees.  BTC China used a crazy $6 fee for me to move less than one bitcoin off their exchange and that was the non-priority fee!

There's gotta be a better way to do this than by taking up an entire block with your singular transaction.  Current software deals horribly with larger transactions as it is, even sending a 30kB transaction takes ages to sign and often causes lockups, a 1MB transaction would likely crash current wallets.
But that said if the exchanges really do support segwit2x then I'd be happy to trade the segwit only fork coins for 2x, but we'd need a better way to do it than this huge transaction size method since I doubt it'd work well with current software and it'd involve ridiculous fees (you're basically buying out an entire block)

They were one of the first companies to really pump money into the Bitcoin ecosystem to grow it, so they basically put money into pretty much every Bitcoin related company at the time. But the conspiracy theories where people think DCG has complete control over these companies is insane, they participated in seed rounds or early fundraising rounds but they're only the majority owner of a few companies like Greyscale and Coindesk.
The main reason so many of the supporters of Segwit2x has DCG as an investor is just that they invested in almost every Bitcoin company a few years back. Which includes a bunch of companies supporting segwit2x but also includes companies against it like Blockstream. DCG doesn't have majority ownership of all these companies.

Brother, I've lost almost all the money I had before, in fact I lost almost everything in the 2008 stock market crash, almost as much money as you lost today. In fact, I was in an even worse position because I was living off of a lot of loans at the time that I lost my savings, and I had credit card debt on top of that. But don't let something as stupid as money make you suicidal-there are much more important things in life, as much as we all want to get rich.
And today I have many, many times how much money I lost back then. I almost make as much money in one month after taxes what I lost that day, so looking back it seems silly that I was ever that stressed and sad about it. Even if today you've lost all your life savings, you can earn many times more than that in the future-it's not easy to see today, and it wasn't easy for me to see back then either.
But please, get your computer properly secured before you do anything else. It's very clear that your computer is not set up correctly. I am very suspicious that you are using an unlicensed copy of Windows instead of a real copy, and that you do not have high quality antivirus software. I would strongly suggest completely replacing the computer with one that has a 100% genuine copy of windows with defender turned on, and then on top of that putting a 100% genuine antivirus package from a very strong company. If you can't afford a new computer, have someone who is an actual expert secure the system for you, at the minimum I would fully wipe the disks (after retrieving any wallets you may still have on it) and do a full reinstall with a genuine copy of windows.
I promise you that this is not worth being suicidal over. You *WILL* make much more money than this in the future, and one day you'll laugh at this.

The reason why it would be bad practice long term to constantly have hard forks and replay is that you end up with so many chain splits that the 21 million limit becomes a joke. Sure, short term people will drive up the price to try and cash in like with the BCH fork but long term we just end up with 20 Bitcoin variants that completely dilute the market.
It will be a very volatile and interesting two months either way

A lot of wallets force relatively high fees, that's the actual problem.  Coinbase is also exacerbating the fee issue with their algorithm generating huge fees which is causing a lot of the wallet algorithms to pick crazy high fees.
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:02:01
You couldn't because there are alarge amount of bitcoins people don't want to sell for $4000 so you'd have to pay increasingly higher prices to secure more Bitcoin.
I've personally not sold any Bitcoins even with the huge price runup and my entry point with some averaging down is around $400.  I don't plan on selling any until $10K and even then I'd only sell a small portion.  I'm sure a lot of other holders think like me.
This was always a long shot bet but I was betting on it eventually being worth tens of thousands, not just $4000.

It's because they use each unique address for that particular transaction, so that they can keep track of whether you've paid or not for that particular transaction.

So you're saying Jeff was right?  The reality is that people aren't going to go and move enough coins over to segwit wallets to actually utilize all the new space. For one thing you're not saving any money in fees since you're paying a regular transaction fee to move it to begin with.

The Chinese have been the least likely to not deliver on business promises in my experience and ESPECIALLY in the Bitcoin world.
Anybody who's tried to buy mining hardware from US firms like Butterfly Labs or Cointerra knows exactly what I mean. The Chinese firms, even the no name shady ones that nobody's ever heard of, tend to deliver products much more rapidly and reliably. The only downside was that one no-name firm I purchased a miner from didn't seem to properly electrically insulate the raspberry pi portion of their miner correctly-so quality control from China is still an issue with smaller companies.
You seriously have no idea what you're talking about.  Chinese companies became such a big part of the Bitcoin ecosystem because they were the most reliable companies out there.

Sure if by some companies you mean the majority of exchanges and payment processors.  If you look at the list of supporters and people against it it's basically Core devs against it (since it's obviously competing code) and then exchanges and processors almost all for it.
The non-Core affiliated companies that are against segwit2x include several companies working on layer 2 solutions-meaning that if the main block size was bigger their solutions wouldn't be as needed and they won't make money.
Everyone is siding with what works for their own financial interests, there's no shock here.  Exchanges like Coinbase/GDAX and Gemini want lower fees because they used to eat the fees for customers so that people would use the wallet features and whatnot.  With higher transaction fees customers are complaining and the fees they eat for GDAX have skyrocketed.  They've started to pass on fees on the Coinbase side. Payment processors like Bitpay have seen huge drops in transaction volumes as the fees have gone up and it's gotten to the point where multiple vendors were dropping Bitpay. So similarly they're for segwit2x because they need MUCH lower fees and they need it ASAP.  Miners are for the 2X fork because long term they don't want all scaling to be on second layer solutions since the block reward will drop and they will be heavily dependent on the fees.  So larger blocks = more total fees in the long run even though in the short term it makes fees cheaper.
So it's pretty simple overall, Bitpay is strongly in favor because their business literally depends on it and the folks against it are mostly against it for the same reasons.
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:45:56
The miners run a substantial portion of the full nodes.  And more importantly they're the only nodes that actually verify the integrity of the blockchain, making them the most important nodes of all.

Higher values will make it stable because of the amount of money needed to shift the price by a meaningful amount.  At $40K, assuming similar  of bitcoin being available on the market, it'll take 10x as much money to move the price.  At $400k it'll take 100x.

lol, all the biggest exchanges will consider S2X the only true BTC so why would the miners dump it?  They wouldn't even be able to cash out the other fork if they wanted to.
Coinbase/GDAX is supporting Segwit2x and Gemini said they'd support the longest chain, which would be the chain that has more hashrate by default, which would be S2X.

This would likely destroy the value of Bitcoin since it wouldn't have the security of having all the Bitcoin miners behind it.  Even the new 7nm Bitcoin mining chips being made by Japan's GMO group would be useless if you suddenly sprung a new algorithm, so an algorithm change would mean literally every miner would be on segwit2x as by default. It would honestly be very hard to lay claim that you are the original Bitcoin if every single miner is mining the other chain and your chain not only uses a different mining algorithm but would have significantly less value and security.
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:43:33
This really is a terrible explanation and doesn't mention the existence of the previous Hong Kong Agreement.
And frankly the assertion that Segwit2x is all about ASICBOOST is just ridiculous, ASICBOOST wouldn't work on Segwit2x anyway so there's no secret miner hashrate advantage to supporting Segwit2x over Segwit, that's only the case with Bitcoin Cash and frankly ASICBOOST isn't necessarily all that negative and nor was it even invented by Bitmain (it was invented by one of the guys at Cointerra)
Of course this explanation is pitched to noobs, since nobody who actually knows what happened would believe any of this drivel.

Why would they need to download a new client?  Multiple existing clients would seamlessly work with segwit2x, including the most popular ones like [Electrum](
I honestly don't think you know what you're talking about, very few people run full Bitcoin Core nodes because of how long it takes to sync and the storage requirements.  The major SPV wallets will work properly in the case of a chain split so end users would maybe have to toggle a setting or two to continue using it.
I run a full node just to have one available, but I'm in a very tiny minority of people who do so and it's a headache because sometimes the block data gets screwy and requires the whole chain be re-downloaded to fix it which basically renders it unusable for a few days while it syncs. I honestly don't know a single casual bitcoin user who runs Core.

I think every time it hits one of these big round numbers it sets off a bunch of sales from people who've been holding it and waiting until it hit their magic number. I'm sure a lot of holders told themselves that $5000 was their magic number for selling, so that's basically all you're seeing. Seems like $3000 triggered this but for whatever reason $4000 didn't really seem to trigger much of this, but $5000 is a nice round number that I'm sure a ton of people have their targets set at.
But the good news is that once these people have finished selling off the next time it crests $5000 it'll likely stay up.  The real question is how long can this overall crypto bullrun go for.

The computers you use to login need to be secure to start with or none of this stuff will help you.
A virus could just wait until you're logged into Bittrex for real and do all sorts of harm. In this case it basically redirected his logins to the hacker and they logged in as him and stole his funds. But there's so many other things it could have done, for example it could have just waited until he was logged in an opened a background process that sent funds to itself via your legitimate login.
I'm curious what security software OP runs, I suspect they do not run a proper antivirus package at all. I've seen numerous people say to just run Microsoft Defender but if you're invested in cryptocurrencies that's not going to cut it lol.  And I notice that their windows is set to Chinese. If they're in China many computers run bootleg versions of Windows that can't even run Defender, in which case it's trojan and virus city.
Anybody who's accessing crypto on a computer that doesn't have both a 100% real copy of Windows installed as well as a full blown antivirus software package (a good one) along with Defender set to weekly scans is at very high risk of this happening to them. 
Also, we're just talking about protecting yourself in terms of exchanges, but you should also not have hot wallets containing any significant amount of money. For Bitcoin at least you can easily run a watch only wallet to keep an eye on your balances, but even if someone completely compromised your computer they'd get nothing out of that. It's also best to secure your Gmail with 2FA but also remove the ability to have someone recover it via your phone number because it's very easy to compromise your phone  And if you do have a phone, you should also paranoidally secure any cloud services tied to it, like iCloud.
But OP's main mistake here is that their computer is compromised.

The only caveat is that Coinbase is very reluctant to give you a very large daily withdrawal limit from GDAX. The security features also seem slightly less robust on the GDAX side, no Vault for example.

They still have to pay their processor a fee to convert to USD and it's only slightly cheaper than taking credit cards. They could just take cash with no fee at all as well so why would they discount the Bitcoin price below that of cash? Cash is unattractive because you have to physically move it to your bank account as a business, but Bitcoin comes with it's own headaches, like trying to train all your cashiers to process bitcoin refunds, which is a lot harder than telling someone to walk to the bank every few hours.
Expecting businesses to discount for Bitcoin makes no sense. The only promotions businesses run are for credit cards because the credit card companies are providing big marketing dollars, like with Amex's shop small promos and similar.

I think if you wait until about 2022 that $25K is very possible, because you have the next halving coming into play and more and more buy in from wealthy funds and individuals who'll help further grow the ecosystem. More than that is difficult without some crazy levels of adoption. But basically I think that Tom Lee has the pricing about right. Of course this is the price if everything goes right, which it very well may not.

Some heuristics based antivirus packages may catch these in time, but it would vary by company and can be unpredictable.
I suspect OP is running a pirated copy of windows without even Defender on though. It looks like they have a Chinese version of windows and the majority of copies are pirated in China.

The pre merger JP Morgan also got slapped with a tiny bit of fines but what they did was minimal compared to what WaMu and Bear Stearns had done, and JP Morgan is the bank that saved those two banks.

lol, the money you pay with is the credit card company's money when you use a credit card, not yours.  If a merchant tries to overbill or sells you garbage and refuses to refund it the credit card company can simply never actually settle that payment with the merchant if you complain to them. So from the consumer perspective it's about 10000x safer than using Bitcoin.

These companies combined actually make up the vast majority of the Bitcoin ecosystem, so I don't know what you want.  Not just hashpower, look at the full list of companies, they represent people from all across the spectrum and combined are likely to be the economic majority.  If you have evidence that there are people holding significantly more bitcoin and who are using that bitcoin to actually increase the bitcoin economy that total more economic activity than these companies combined then please show this evidence.  I'm not sure even Satoshi themselves would have more economic sway than the group that is agreeing to this.
Demanding that an economic minority be able to run everything is frankly the antithesis of Bitcoin.  Even if you really feel that one technical solution is superior it doesn't give you the right to insist that it be the one that everyone adopts.  And at this point I am seriously tired of the nonstop infighting.  We need to move on and just get segwit activated and if that means a 2MB hardfork a few months down the line I think most people are willing to risk the hardfork.  We need to be able to actually help make bitcoin competitive with all the newer cryptocurrencies and that starts the moment we actually move this forward.

No by the time the 7950 came out you needed ASICs to mine bitcoin.  I did used to mine with some 5770's though but sold off the coins at something like $2 each.

lol, I remember last time when everyone started saying how even $2000 would be cheap because it's going to be worth $50K someday, etc.  Might be true in the long, long, long run but I'd still sure as hell rather buy in at $200 than $2000.
But I am really curious just how high this can run this time around.  I thought a rally would be triggered by the next halving as it would significantly lower the sell side pressure from miners dumping bitcoins to pay for power and cooling and equipment but the rally seems to have come early thanks to Chinese inflationary issues.
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:02:26
The best "time" is to simply actually help develop bitcoin into a viable real currency used as such.  That's the only way long term to grow the value significantly and to stabilize the price on an upwards trajectory.  Otherwise it's just speculative bubbles one after another.  
If you buy bitcoin you need to help push for this kind of eventual use or you're just creating bubbles.

The reason this time around is that real world Chinese inflation is sky high despite what the official inflation numbers are supposedly.  Prices in Chinese supermarkets have literally doubled within the last month which is driving the normal people there crazy, and causing people to try and shift money into stuff that isn't RMB.  So now there's a huge influx of Chinese money into bitcoin as it's one of the things that's relatively easy to shift your money into in China.  Of course if the government there clamps down on it again it'll once again remove the big source of cash influx and probably cause the price to come crashing back down to earth, but at this moment it's likely that people in China are running to sign up for accounts on the Chinese exchanges to get out of RMB.
Seriously, just go to China and look at the prices in the supermarkets there for food, it's out of control.  I was just there over the summer and prices were perfectly normal but speaking to people who are there now the prices have easily doubled which is causing a lot of panic.

It's pretty funny how numb you get to crazy price movements after a while.  Maybe it's new to the people who just bought in this time around, but you really need a thick skin to where it doesn't even bother you that it's dropping hundreds or going up by hundreds.  You'll get there eventually if you stay in the bitcoin game long enough.  Pretty soon you'll get used to seeing your net-worth constantly go on a roller coaster ride.

Why don't you use one of the many credit cards without a foreign transaction fee? Or your bank account?  If you already knew they'd be charging a foreign transaction fee why did you use your credit card again?
I have multiple credit and debit cards that don't charge a foreign transaction fee, at least 4 in total so I don't see how it's coinbase's fault here.  They're not charging you the fee, your bank is and there's no reason coinbase should reimburse you.  It's your choice which card you use.
The list of cards without a foreign fee is super long and includes most Amex cards that charge an annual fee, the chase cards that charge an annual fee, the free Charles Schwab cards, the USAA debit and credit cards that have no fees, Bank Americard Travel Rewards card, Capitol one quicksilver, etc.  No business is responsible for the credit card fees from the credit card you choose to use, you're the one choosing a high fee card not them.
I haven't paid a foreign transaction fee on a card since like 2001 and I've spent 25+ weeks abroad since 2001.  
If you don't wanna pay the fee use a bank account or one of the NUMEROUS cards that don't have this fee.  I don't understand why you would expect them to reimburse this fee, how would coinbase stay in business paying a fee that's your fault?

The vast majority of bitcoin holders don't want a UASF.  Even if you look at the minority of users who actually run a full node, most people do not want a UASF despite people setting up multiple nodes to rig the vote in favor of a UASF.  Constantly posting that UASF is on the way and somehow it's "for the users" is ludicrous, just because you keep repeating it to yourself doesn't mean it's true.  Reading the echo chamber that is this subreddit doesn't mean anything, the vast majority of bitcoin users don't run a full node and are either using a light wallet or using an exchange/web based wallet.  It might not be what you want but that's the reality.

Dozens of posts here on reddit...go to China yourself and try convincing people to use it.  I do hold some Qtum that's trying to achieve this sort of mobile use in China but I'm not delusional about how hard it'll be to compete with wechat and alipay.  And the Chinese government has full control of their Internet.  China also has very high savings interest rates so people can actually earn significant interest on their balances held in alipay-6-7% interest is standard so even for staking tokens you may not be able to compete with their fiat payment systems.
You're competing against payment systems that are not just fee free but pay very high interest rates and are completely ubiquitous already AND backed by the state.  A state with significant control over the Internet.  If you think this is an easy battle you're nuts or you haven't done any actual research about what it's competing against.

They can use both bit 4 and bit 1, with bit 4 signaling to activate the existing bit 1 SW so there's no need to delay anything. Please don't accuse other people of not understanding the technical aspects when you haven't actually studied the proposals yourself, this is the sort of adversarial attitude that is killing Bitcoin. FYI I've been in Bitcoin for 6 years since before GPU mining software was even publicly available and anybody who wanted to have anything to do with Bitcoin had to have a lot of technical knowledge. And the need for people to upgrade their software is a requirement no matter which implementation you want, so I'm not sure how that's a real criticism of anything.

There is an insane crazy ass bubble in the alts right now largely driven by the Ethereum price boom.  Which is now driving people to buy more of all these cryptocurrencies including bitcoin.

Sudden spikes in the price aren't what really excites me, it's the long term growth in demand that I'm in this for.  Don't plan on selling any for cash until maybe $10K (I mean it'd be nice to buy a place to live), though I am considering diversifying a tiny bit (~10%) into some altcoins that might have some potential.

The folks with large economic stakes in the game don't want things to be shaken up, not with bitcoin at such a high price, so it's extremely unlikely to garner sufficient support to become the main chain. 
But if someone is really that strongly believing that their BIP148 coin will be the winning coin they should just buy up rights to the BIP148 chain coins at half price from people.

At this point now that Ethereum is available on multiple exchanges itself, and has a gigantic war chest of money for its foundation?  Pretty much nothing.  If this had come out one or two years ago it likely would have stopped ethereum from taking significant hold, but at this point I can't see anybody caring enough to insist on a bitcoin based equivalent that's running on a chain that's about to have a contentious split.

So what?  They're just saying that they're not making other changes to bitcoin with this release and that it's basically just the code needed to make these changes.  That way it doesn't become an ongoing project like Bitcoin Unlimited would.  They're basically saying that they're gonna go in, make the code needed to implement the segwit plus 2mb hard fork, and then when it's done it's done and other changes to bitcoin are as usual.

The run up was almost entirely driven by speculative mania-people, buying because they're reading that it can go to $6000 or whatever.  [So then when some "analyst" told some media outlets that it would undergo a correction after it hit $2800 a ton of people read that and decided to cash out.]( It's all self fulfilling prophecies right now.
This is exactly why Bitcoin can't just be speculative crap but **NEEDS** to [become a true currency](  It would hugely stabilize the price and bring it to much higher levels because people would be buying it actually use on a daily basis and not just to "HODL."  But people are so excited by the runup that they can't see the forest for the trees.  This speculative runup isn't why Bitcoin exists and it seems most people don't even know this anymore.
TL;DR: The price tanked because the price runup is all driven by FOMO manic, that never lasts.  We need to take the opportunity to make Bitcoin a real currency ASAP or this will be very easily manipulated.

If you actually did some research about why they're empty blocks you'd realize this is an idiotic waste of time.  They're valid blocks that are getting generated within seconds of the previous block, so they keep them empty so that they don't get orphaned. Blocking these blocks does nothing for transaction throughput because the only blocks that this happens with are the ones getting luckily generated seconds after an existing block.
If they were mining empty blocks all the time then yes, it'd be a real problem but they're only mining empty blocks when they come immediately after a regular block.

They could have mined an empty block with or without asicboost, the empty block was due to the timing of the block and at 4 seconds, asicboost's 20% speed up would have meant they would have mined it in 5 seconds instead and still did an empty block.

Patience young padawan.  Seriously, only invest what you can afford to totally lose and then don't even look at the damned price fluctuations, you're in it for long term capital gains not short term profits.  Even now after probably paying an average of about $400-500 per coin my only real regret is all the coins I sold for like $2!
Just make sure whatever you do is to help grow the bitcoin universe and things will work out.  
But uhh...again, don't invest if you can't afford to lose it, who the hell knows.  It's one of those things where in 10 years it's either gonna be worth near $0 or it's gonna be worth $20K a BTC.  It's either gonna find large scale adoption where the sheer volume needed will drive each coin up to tens of thousands each or it's gonna be shunned and go to near $0.
But really I figure you can only lose the amount you invest, while the upside is really still quite amazing.  Not quite as nice as when it went from under a penny to $1000 but still pretty sunny imho.

You know, even though people may have differing viewpoints about bitcoin's future, Jihan being willing to sell actual mining hardware to anybody with the bitcoins to pay for it was a big deal when shady players like KnC were suddenly hoarding all their own ASICs for themselves, BFL was...being BFL, Bitfury chips were very hard to get ahold of, and Avalon didn't have up to date products.  If it weren't for Bitmain it would have just been the big ASIC producers mining with affiliated mining warehouses.
And for what it's worth, Bitmain was always super professional about shipping items ASAP and all their hardware worked far better than the other random miners I've had over the years.  My Cointerra units ended up having issues with the power circuitry, one of my dragon miners kept killing the raspberry pi to the extent where I just didn't end up mining with it, etc.  The Antminers were shipped on time and actually worked reliably, which is why they quickly became the mining hardware of choice for everyone.

It's a speculative investment now but we have a huge opportunity to finally make Bitcoin into what we all dreamed it would be years ago.  If that occurs the price will go far, far, far higher than just using it as a speculative instrument ever could make it. We're talking about being used as the actual money supply.
You're not getting what I'm trying to explain-Japanese people hold everything in cash right now, they don't use credit, they don't use digital payments.  But their cash is constantly being devalued horribly and keeping it at the bank results in negative interest rates-that means the bank is charging Japanese people money just to keep their money. This is one of the primary reasons that Satoshi invented bitcoin, to prevent inflationary theft by centralized banking systems and right here we have the perfect use scenario and even more shocking the Japanese actually legalized it!
If there's ever been a chance for us to realize the original vision of Bitcoin it's now, in Japan.
I just spent my honeymoon in Japan as well, if we have any chance of having Bitcoin reach it's original vision and destiny this is it.

I highly doubt Bitmain gives a crap about an import ban when the majority of their customers live in China where electricity is cheap.  Sure, they have US customers but it's a fraction of their total sales nowadays.  Plus they make just as much mining on their own equipment, this would just further concentrate hashing power if they couldn't export.

I hope you didn't trade in and out of bitcoin to cash too many times.  If you traded between BTC and LTC you may be able to just pay long term capital gains all at once but if you traded between BTC/LTC and cash on BTC-E you probably owe back taxes for every single profitable trade (minus the losses from the unprofitable ones) and interest on those back taxes.

Don't feel too bad it's impossible to just sell at the exact peak unless you're a time traveler.  I sold most of my bitcoin right before the bubble on 2013 for a few hundred bucks instead of many thousands because my friend was panicking about it tanking after SR was shut down.  Sigh.  Spent several years and a lot of time and money to rebuild what I lost.  It won't keep going up forever but these run ups are so hard to predict in terms of where the price will eventually stabilize.
I just told myself after 2013 that I won't sell any at all until 10000, at which point I will likely sell off half.

Honestly if the offline wallets got hacked then they really weren't very offline after all.
But if you're really paranoid they have a multi-signature vault option where to hack it the thief would need to steal 2 out of 3 signatures.  Of course again that means you have to secure it yourself.
I don't think coinbase is as bad of an option as people claim.  My real issue with them is that funds held there aren't really held in specific wallets for you, since they're really held offline and just earmarked for you.  Which is great from a security perspective but somewhat limiting.  You can't sign from your address to prove your balance for example, since Coinbase sweeps all the coins to an offline address.

Issue is that wechat and alipay have 100% of this market locked up.  It's accepted everywhere and by everyone, cabs, shops, random people on the street you ask for change.  I had the equivalent of a $20 bill and went to a post office to get change and they said they didn't have enough cash to break it, but if I sent them money on Wechat or Alipay they could give me a few bucks.  Cab drivers didn't want to take my cash and asked for money by app.  Blew my mind how ubiquitous it was.
But, this does also make the Chinese more likely to accept paying each other with an app.  But it's not clear to me that anybody will switch off of the two entrenched players-they don't charge any fees.

The volatility will reduce as the price goes up though.  Right now it's still relatively easy to move the price quite a bit given the small float, but if each bitcoin was something like $100,000 it'd be a lot harder to move the price up by very much unless you had an obscene amount of cash.
That said it's kinda unlikely it'll hit 100k anytime soon, but one can dream I guess.
@_date: 2017-07-04 05:40:20
Not really a conspiracy theory?  It's how big mining groups have always worked, if you have sufficient new hardware hashrate that you can significantly affect the difficulty you would wait right after a retarget to turn it on to maximize your returns.
Why would you turn it on before the difficulty is locked in for the next period?  You'd be throwing away your own hardware advantage.
But yeah I definitely noticed the hashrate bump because I was looking at the blocks for an ICO that had a timed bonus, and the timing got thrown off by about 3 hours because it was based on block number.

While this is the oldschool bitcoin advice I'm not sure most people are better at storing bitcoins than Coinbase is, especially coins held in the vault.  Coinbase also has a lot of VC funding where they can cover losses from smaller hacks so unless almost all their coins are compromised it's much more likely that you'd lose the coins you stored yourself.

I'm gonna have to agree, there's no way in hell you should hold every last penny and have zero backup plan if bitcoins fail.  There's nothing wrong in investing a large amount in bitcoin, but you should still be saving up for a rainy day or retirement in other ways in case this doesn't work out.  Bitcoin is either going to go to the moon and become super valuable, or it's going to be worth next to nothing if the forces that are against it win.  So put a lot into bitcoin but still put money into a backup plan so you're not jumping off a bridge because something really bad happens to bitcoin, it's not worth ruining your life over money.

Yeah you essentially hold 2 out of 3 required keys.  Only thing is if you lose both you're screwed so it's almost as cumbersome as traditional offline setups.

Coinbase limits are individualized to the account, it's not a flat amount for every account, a lot of people will have lower limits than that, some people will have higher limits than that.
But for bitcoin moves from your own Coinbase bitcoin wallet there's no limit that I know of unless you specifically set a limit yourself for security.  If you turn that off you can move as much bitcoin as you want.  There is a strict limit from GDAX to Coinbase though.

No he has a legitimate point, it's not really clear why Segwit should be discounted so heavily versus standard blockchain space.

For the core devs to constantly sit around whining about other people's work at this point is pretty childish.

It's 20K over a year though and this means you can move the same few bitcoins back and forth between Coinbase and your own hardware wallet or offline wallets and it'll still trigger this clause which is ridiculous. Right now if you moved 4 bitcoin from Coinbase into a hardware wallet then moved it back to Coinbase and then back to your wallet within 12 months you're automatically flagged by the IRS for being super suspicious which is idiotic.

I used to have about 20THash 1-2 years ago (back then this required a ridiculous amount of electricity so we had it on industrial power drops in a large data center) and we ended up selling equipment we spent $50,000 buying for $1500, partly because all our equipment was in a datacenter far across the country from us and our buyer was willing to drive 3 hours there to go pick it up in a pallet.
Mining equipment really doesn't have a very long lifespan and it's basically worthless within a year.

It's only that simple if you don't care about the price of bitcoin, which is heavily dependent on it being the most secure cryptocurrency, which depends on it having a huge amount of hashpower behind it.  Change the PoW and it's easily attacked and not any more valuable than a random alt. 
Bitcoin has also pinned a lot of its value on there only ever being 21 million so suddenly doubling the supply via contentious forks will go over horribly with larger investors.  Gold doesn't suddenly double its supply overnight because people in the Gold business are angry at each other.

Well you can deduct the transactions you lost money on so if you ended up with the same amount you likely won't owe too much in taxes unless your losses are all in a different year than your gains.

Having segwit is not a reason for the price to be higher, by that logic Litecoin should be worth even more than Bitcoin right now.  Coins that are accepted by existing wallets and the high hash rate are why BTC is still more valuable than LTC, not segwit.  Where is the evidence that just having segwit would make the coin more valuable?! Especially if it has no transaction throughput in the beginning.
For BIP148 to actually work you would need to gain significant mining power behind it or you get some crappy chain that's unusable and has segwit that's already active on multiple other altcoins.

There's zero evidence this is true one way or another, by the IRS own guidelines it should be applicable but they tend to challenge it even with other property, especially if it turns short term capital gains into long term gains.  But if you are just deferring long term gains there is a good chance they don't really care.  You will eventually have to pay them and now they know you owe them money in the future.
Either way if you're doing 1031 exchanges with long term held crypto it doesn't really hurt to attempt the filing.  Worst case they make you pay the long term cap gains rate now instead of later, so budget for it and try to file for the like kind exchange. Why not?  Best case you get to defer taxes, worst case you pay what you would otherwise. 
This is assuming you have proper records of everything obviously lol

From what I understand you can reset your account password that way, but your Authenticator will still be active on the account, so they can't send any bitcoin out without the Authenticator key unless they talk to Coinbase customer support and go through some kind of verification to reset the Authenticator requirement.

Either way Coinbase should just prevent any movement of coins for x number of days after a password reset by default.  I think they have security settings people can set but they might not be defaulted on.  And it should be opt out in case you're bad at remembering your password lol.

I do think the ICO bubble is pumping up Ethereum but the problem is that once people start to use an alternative it becomes difficult to get them to switch back to Bitcoin because now they hold all this Ethereum and have no incentive to support Bitcoin.  Honestly at this point Bitcoin basically **needs** the Ethereum ICO bubble to implode.

What puzzles me is the fact that people in the west like to take every single thing any media outlet in China does, or some "government owned" company in China does as some sort of official approval by the Chinese government. The government has it's hands in almost everything in China because it's a friggin' communist country, and even though it's been opened up to privatization the government maintains stakes in lots of things, so interpreting every single thing as some sort of official government stance is completely and utterly insane.  The Chinese government owns bowling alleys, movie theaters, all sorts of random businesses, it does not mean that it endorses bowling as the official sport of China or anything.  I remember the same news station doing a series of consumer protection stories and because some of them involved U.S. companies it was interpreted as some kind of attack by China on U.S. businesses when the same news station did several stories on China's largest food processor and many other Chinese corporations that were probably more negative.  Is China against it's own businesses now?  Interpreting some reporter's investigatory report as the central government of China damning any particular company is insanity.  
TL;DR: Stop overinterpreting everything to come out of China, everything might be related to the government but it doesn't mean anything is an official government stance.

Problem is that a lot of the time you can't verify it on a second device because it's dependent on a browser session, and then on top of that it still wouldn't stop you from being vulnerable to a MITM attack.  You can minimize this by using two different internet connections entirely and 2 devices if the receiving website supports showing the same address to two devices, but it's rare that this is the case.
If you have time you can send multiple small transactions and verify with the party that's supposed to receive it that they did each time, so even if you got MITM'd you'd minimize your losses.

This is totally wrong.  It's the minimum to trigger REQUIRED reporting of the transfer, but if you constantly send transactions just under $10K you actually get much more red flagged because it appears to be an attempt to avoid the limit.  It's actually better to send transfers over $10K than multiple transfers under $10K because it shows you don't have anything to hide.
Sending a ton of slightly under $10K transactions is not only insanely suspicious but it's illegal and WILL get your bank account closed.
I've spent larger amounts than this buying cars, moving money to investment accounts, etc. and it's never been an issue.  It gets reported to the government but all it'll show is that you transferred money-big deal. The bank may review your account to see where the money is from and that's that.

Your post is a good summary overall but on this point I think your post is misleading-exchanges are not "very upset" about the hard fork since multiple exchanges behind the agreement, including Bitflyer, BTCC, Bitpay (not a traditional exchange but they exchange it for businesses), Bter, Coinbase, Coins.ph, Shapeshift.io, etc. as well as multiple other businesses that regularly swap between fiat and bitcoin.
And while there aren't huge numbers of user nodes currently supporting it, I also don't think most users are all that upset about it, most users are probably much more neutral than the average poster here.
I think if you actually look at the players behind the agreement there is sufficient support from exchanges and other bitcoin payment businesses that a hard forked chain would have a lot of support.

Paypal is actually in a great position to become a BTC payment system since they already have the proper money transmitter licenses and whatnot in place from being around so long (IIRC in the early days Paypal also broke all sorts of rules but then paid the fines and went legit) so honestly if they just built a BTC backend they'd be able to be the most legitimate/legal bitcoin transmitter around.  Being that they're paypal I'm sure there would be fees involved but it seems like BTC would be a good way for Paypal to lower the fees they're paying as well since they're currently having to pay CC companies quite a bit of fees.

What you're missing out on is that money keeps flowing into Bitcoin because it is "the" cryptocurrency, with the largest market cap and reach.  If people start PERCEIVING Ethereum as "the" cryptocurrency then the money flows into Ethereum instead.  It's all a self fulfilling prophecy, so of course the people backing Ethereum want everyone to believe this, it'll make it true.

Bought and used a couple ether for the first time today just to see what's driving this ICO mania.  Honestly the issues I saw with it in the early days are still true, there's very poor overall network throughput and dealing with something as simple as the Bancor ICO basically ground the network to a halt.  So I actually think that Bitcoin is actually vastly superior long term as a currency than Ethereum, and that Ethereum really needs to fix its throughput issues.
We need to put our dumbass arguments behind us in the Bitcoin community though, or sooner or later someone else really will eat our lunch.  It's already a huge loss of value that most ICOs are underpinned by ETH now.  We could have easily seen a $5000 bitcoin if the money flowing into ETH had flowed into Bitcoin instead

Most of the attacks that these hardware wallets are vulnerable to also apply to an old offline PC or raspberry pi.  It doesn't matter that the partition is entirely encrypted, at some point the private key will be decrypted when attempting to sign for transactions and that's where the vulnerability lies.

Yeah the reality is that the segwit only camp gave the miners a taste of high fees at the same time that the block rewards had just dropped in half.  So now we should suddenly expect miners to lower their fees even though electricity and datacenters are most definitely not free?  If we had scaled the block size long before the halving we wouldn't have any of this miners vs core nonsense we have today.  There's no going back now that miners have tasted huge fees and build up more mining capacity that factors these fees in.

What in the hell are you talking about, Coinbase has a ton of funding and they're currently [raising another $100 million during their current VC funding round]( so they could repay the losses many times over without needing to resort to fractional reserve banking.  This isn't MtGox where it was literally some dude using deposited funds to run the whole company, Coinbase has a ton of outside funding.
Also as a side note, the apps tend to stay functional even when the main site is down, and GDAX has had better uptime than Coinbase, so these crazy conspiracies seem pretty silly.  They just need to improve uptime of the main coinbase.com site.

They're crazy behind schedule but they were like that even with the FPGA's so most knowledgeable folks went in expecting there to be issues.   Not quite this length of time in terms of problems but like you me too , the other ASIC manufacturers didn't really all perform much better as businesses.   They are actually finally delivering the miners though and the main reason people are pissed off is just that they would have made a fuckton of money if they had delivered in a more timely manner.   But I remember doing the math when they announced and to be honest the returns now are better than I had projected so I think it's kinda nuts to compare it to the very few lucky folks who got into Avalon batch one.   
It is too bad that I didn't invest in asicminer instead though lol

It's a lot of money but in the grand scheme of things 15% is lower than what most middle class folks pay even on a $30/hr job.  Complaining a ton about it isn't gonna get a lot of sympathy lol.
Just remember if you bump your total income over $250K there's still an additional cap gains tax for high income earners for now until the Obamacare taxes actually go away.  But it's only on some portion of your cap gains and like 3.8% on that portion.  Still...probably a good idea to cash out slowly if you want to, dumping everything all at once will probably trigger the worst tax bill.   And if you're wealthy enough it might be worth it to move to Nevada or something before cashing out lol.

Well it's to prevent you from capitalizing on insider information you would be privy to, and also to prevent you from screwing your employer over because you know what moves they're about to make (like if you knew they wanted to buy 1 million shares of xyz so you went ahead and picked it up in advance to sell to them at a higher price).
I do find it odd that your company only lets you have a 1 day period to do what you need, that's kinda weird. Some other companies don't mind too much as long as it's not in the same industry as what they're investing in.

Yeah I don't think people outside of China realize how entrenched digital payments are.  Most people there PREFER it to cash, I'm talking about random cabbies and just folks on the street. I asked for change to buy soda from a vending machine and people asked me to wechat or Alipay them money because they carried so little cash they couldn't give me change otherwise.
You can live in China with 100% digital currency as it is, but securing it with a blockchain makes perfect sense here to prevent companies from just inflating the money supply.
Unfortunately because of how entrenched wechat and Alipay are it's essentially impossible to convince people in China to actually use cryptocurrencies as money.  But it also means they're comfortable with digital instruments sent using qr codes so I think the smart play is actually smart contract and dapp platforms there.  Lots of players there in this space but nobody with actually functional software yet.  Qtum is supposedly launching test net at the end of this month though it's unclear how functional it all is so far, their updates make it sound like they're still cobbling pieces together frantically.
As far as using bitcoin as a currency goes I think Japan is our only real chance.  There's almost no digital payment use there, no credit card use, etc. and cash is intensely popular so Japan is one of the few countries we actually stand a chance in.
Basically I see it as Japan-&gt;push for Bitcoin adoption as currency.
China-&gt;Push for people to adopt smart contract platform-government there will enforce their own blockchain for currencies so you're not going to win that fight.

Yes but eventually fees will be so high nobody except professional lightning operators can afford on chain transactions.  Everything would be massively centralized and completely defeat the original vision where people could spend satoshis.  I remember  when we were talking about how someday we'd have to make SMALLER units than a satoshi by changing the number of digits so it'd be even more divisible.  Now even hundreds of satoshi can be unspendable.

I think the murder thing is actually pretty relevant, the feds are trying to show that even with a drug market where the leader is espousing all these idealistic things, the drug trade very quickly gets violent, etc. and thus justifies their continued war on drugs.
And there is a huge difference between a bank transferring money for someone without doing a lot of checking on where that money came from vs setting up a market where all sorts of illegal stuff is sold.  HSBC didn't ask questions when they should, whereas SR was actively soliciting for drug dealers to go there, how is that even vaguely comparable.

Almost the entirety of the centralization that exists today has to do with production capability of making your own efficient ASIC and zero to do with block sizes.  Can you provide actual real world use scenarios where a slightly large 2MB base block actually prevents anybody from using Bitcoin?
This silliness needs to stop, I don't like how centralized Bitcoin has become but this is primarily an issue with how mining has centralized, not a problem with 2MB base blocks.  I think 2MB base blocks plus segwit should fix the throughput problems immediately while letting us build safe 2nd layer solutions and is an excellent compromise.  Constantly refusing to compromise is frankly suicidal for Bitcoin, the competition isn't just sitting around arguing all day long.

The real problem is that everyone with an early order (I have a June order from last year) could have EASILY gone with Avalon or ASICMiner also.  I would have easily invested in both if BFL had just been fucking honest about their shipping timelines, instead they basically kept lying and lying about how they would be shipping in October even though it's clear that there was no fucking way they could have possibly shipped in October, or December, or February.
If they hadn't lied to us I would have bought shares in ASICMiner or an Avalon in addition to my BFL units, but these guys just kept lying, and that's what's most upsetting.  If I had put an equal amount of money into ASICMiner my shares would be worth $800K now, and if I had put it into Avalon I would have made $200K in equity (based on how much people are paying these days, which is insane) and mined about $100K.  Instead, I get to kick myself for listening to their nonsense.
Worse yet I kept believing them even when I could have gotten a batch 2 Avalon, etc.  They just flatly lied about their timeline and didn't come clean about all the problems they were having.
They basically cost a lot of people a lot of money with their lies, hence the high level of heatedness.  Luckily I'll do ok in life anyways but I'd imagine that for most people this might be their one shot at really making some serious cash so I'd be fucking seriously pissed off if that was my one shot and BFL killed it.

I don't think it's a license violation to give advice via the internet, it's more of a liability issue that you'll get sued when someone turns out to have some rare crap you didn't mention, etc.  There are doctors who have advice radio shows, columns, etc. but they almost always couch their advice with some disclaimer like, you should go see your doctor ASAP, etc.
I recall hearing about someone who lost a malpractice lawsuit because they told someone to go get a mole checked out because it looked suspicious at a dinner party.  Turned out that the person had melanoma but since they didn't go get it checked out they didn't find out until it had metastasized horribly.  They managed to win the lawsuit because their lawyers argued that the doctor had established a doctor-patient relationship at the dinner party, and knowing that the patient had what was likely a deadly cancer should have followed up and made sure that the guy had gone to get treatment.  Which is fucking bullshit, but this is why doctors don't go around giving out free advice and instead tell you to go see your doctor.
Also you'll get in some deep shit if your employer's contract bars you from this kind of work, which is a lot more likely than the licensing board revoking your license.  You have to do something really fucking shitty to get your license revoked and giving out legitimate advice over the internet isn't any different than doing it on TV, etc.
TL;DR I don't think it's a licensing issue so much of a huge liability issue.  Also as the site mentions, a contract issue for a lot of doctors.

You are not correct, and today btc china is unable to accept bank deposits.  I don't know why you would choose to believe that the Chinese would continue to allow bank to btc exchange transfers when they explicitly told the banks not to get involved in exchanging to btc and banned third party payment processors from the same.  Just because they do not explicitly state "no more transfers to btc china" does not mean that they're ok with banks sending money to bitcoin exchanges, the Chinese almost never write anything in absolutes or spell things out like that so it's insane that everyone here just chooses to bury their head in the sand and pretend like there's nothing wrong when the Chinese were signaling very clearly that they're not going to let you get around their capital controls.  So of course you all down vote me because you don't like what I'm saying because it's not good news?  The groupthink here is ridiculous, I am much more familiar with Chinese economics than most people here and half my family are bankers that deal with the Asia region.  So go ahead and down vote me if you want but the writing was very obviously on the wall regarding banks and transfers to btc china, I don't know why everyone insists on an insanely narrow reading of Chinese statements that makes no sense in context.  
For the record I am long bitcoin so my posts are not some attempt to tank the price, I'm just telling you how you really should be interpreting things instead of this insane blind optimism.
TL;DR burying your head in the sand to ignore the writing on the wall and down voting anybody who tries to tell you otherwise is a good way to lose money.

Just looking through some of the consults on justAnswer makes it seem like the lack of a physical exam is a real problem.  It's probably less so for dermatology stuff since they can use a good picture to tell for most things, but for other complaints it's almost impossible to get a good feel.  It seems like a big liability issue for a lot of these.

I've seen deposits delayed for days when sending to a coinbase wallet so if you want speed it's not really the thing.  If the merchant is using blockchain to check for the transaction it might be good to just use a blockchain wallet that you put a little bit of spending money in.

lol the delusional posts here need to stop.  The reality is that if the miners fork off they'll have a secure chain that looks just like bitcoin always has.  If you fork off a segwit chain without miner support you'll end up with a litecoin clone, except far less secure because litecoin has the majority scrypt hashrate while your fork will be prone to 51% attacks.  This idea is beyond idiotic and only people prone to religious fervor can delude themselves into believing this.  Bitcoin isn't a religion, stop treating it like a religious war.

In all seriousness, the fact that I can't use the coinbase app and am stuck with a crazy buggy and near unusable blockchain app has me ready to switch to a Nexus 5.  Already got the Nexus 5 so as much as I actually like iOS and iMessage/Facetime (which are honestly very good compared to the Android counterparts...hangsouts look like shit compared to facetime) the fact that Bitcoins are near unusable on iOS is really pissing me off.

So the government is going to run an auction for BTC?  I guess my real question is what about users who only bought or sold legal items?  Like people who sold a whole bunch of candies and whatnot.  I'm not sure if they broke any laws so the government can't really just seize their money.

Well this is interesting.  I wonder if they found anything really solid on his computer that would really prove that he's DPR.  Because they have evidence that DPR tried to get someone killed, etc. but the evidence that this particular dude is DPR is mostly that he was in the vicinity when someone was accessing the servers.  I'm not sure if that's really enough to tie him down as definitely being DPR beyond a reasonable doubt.  Even if the evidence showed that he was involved with SR it doesn't necessarily prove he's the ringleader so I'm not sure how the prosecution is going to try to prove that he's really DPR.

No you don't, unless you want insane profits because you're going to do it as a full time job.  You can get fairly reasonable returns for tens of thousands which plenty of middle class folks probably have.

Wire fees aren't that high at all, they're usually fixed fees that run something like $10-40 depending on the bank, both domestic and international.
Also, if you actually have $6 million on deposit with a bank there's pretty much a 100% chance that they're not charging you anything for a wire.

Maybe in Asia chicks are just more aggressive about investments and business?  I remember reading about the wealthiest folks in each country and IIRC China is one of the few countries where there's a huge percentage of the wealthiest people who are women.

Anyways, China is probably one of the more equal opportunity places in the world with regards to gender, I think Taiwan must be pretty similar as well since HTC has a baller chairwoman and whatnot.

I don't think you know what you're talking about.  In the Chinese market most people do not have credit cards or credit files or anything like in the US so dealing directly with the exchanges is nearly impossible.  The banks there are now banned from sending money to the exchanges and now payment processors like Alipay are banned.  How can you deal directly with an exchange if you cannot move money from any other account to the exchange?!?  In a country where the exchange cannot easily verify your credit worthiness no less.  China didn't ban it but they basically made it impossible to put money into it so there's hardly a difference.  What are you going to do, throw yuan at your screen?

Well, hopefully this means the difficulty won't keep going up ridiculously like it has to date, if they really don't ship all those chips, even if someone else ends up obtaining them it'll push the timeline out quite a bit.  And in fact since the difficulty is so high many of those chips won't even be worth manufacturing into miners.

Yeah what's to stop a random person from reviewing it and making crazy medical claims?  Or more likely, what's to stop a first year medical student from pretending to be a doctor to earn some cash on the side.  I think the idea is good but there's too many liability and legal issues as it is, let alone the fact that they don't bother to verify whether you're getting advice from a doctor or a random person pretending to be a doctor and looking up your symptoms on wikipedia.

This doesn't destroy them at all, western unions entire business is that people could send money from country a to country b and send it via cash.  It was more expensive before since they had to then wire money between their locations, but with bitcoins their overhead goes to nothing.  They have no real competitors to speak of anyway, who's going to hand you over fiat in almost any country you can think of?  If you send bitcoin right now "to Africa" you have no way to get it out as fiat.  Western Union is in the precise business of converting to fiat cash so why would they be threatened, they're overjoyed.

I honestly don't think this is the real reason you can send money via plenty of other apps whether it's paypal or chase quickpay or whatnot.  What we need to do is to email Tim Cook en masse until they reverse this stance.   I'm sure he doesn't actually read all his emails but if thousands of people are emailing to complain maybe it'll get a second look.   In the meantime I'm probably switching to android which is ridiculous that I have to do this just to be able to use an up to date wallet.

No it's not, they have an English site and anybody can sign up.  The only thing you can't do without being Chinese is open a Chinese bank account to withdraw into Chinese fiat.  If you're just trading back and forth to BTC it hardly matters what you're trading into and the whole site is available in English if you're not a moron.  That said, it's not a good place to trade because the interface is clunky and it lags like hell outside of China.
