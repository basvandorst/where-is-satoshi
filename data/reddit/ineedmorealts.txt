No. Bitcoin is more instable that the currencies of any stable country on the planet 


But which can (and is) controlled by a hand full of rich people with the money to do so.

Which of his policies haven't been ham fisted? His tariffs are poorly though out nonsense which has done nothing but hurt Americans business
His wall was and is a retard pipe dream 
His deregulation has added billions to the American national debt 
He's sending troops to the boarder to deal with people that are unarmed, not a threat and can't be stopped from entering the country 
@_date: 2018-11-15 09:53:55


How are you lot this retarded. You can't legally stop them from entering America, because before their in America they aren't subject to American laws. So really what the fuck are those troop going to do?


No it's me pointing out Trump being a total retard. Those things are all facts. I know you lot like feels and not facts, but those are still facts

@_date: 2018-11-15 08:19:48
