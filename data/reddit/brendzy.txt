Yes a large fee would clear everything up. I just redid your average work units for everything and it's around 46.17 sat/WU. The last block cleared 46.92sat/WU. You are getting really close. Most miners have a large mempool and chose transactions to include taking CPFP in account.
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:01:11
Yes, you have done a CPFP by including a large fee on that last transaction. You are right on the cusp of getting everything confirmed. Your average workunit fee is around 51sat/WU and 53sat/WU is being confirmed right now.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:33:21
You are spending unconfirmed transactions. Worst is this one 
That 500sat fee should go a long way to pushing through that transaction. Nothing to worry about, right now.
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:14:29
Spend the unconfirmed transaction with a fee twice the going rate. The current fee is ~10sat/byte so send with ~20sat/byte.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:47:58
You are spending bitcoin that is not confirmed in the blockchain yet. That one transaction i posted has a lowish fee but you included a good fee on your last transaction that helps the previous one to get confirmed. If it's critical you can spend the change with an even higher fee to help it, but without doing anyting it should be confirmed anytime now as the mempool is clearing.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:56:04
I was mistaken, this is the worst one 
I just checked my node for that transaction and it's still in the mempool. Is this a critical transaction? It should confirm soon based on my back of the napkin fee estimation.

You need to index the utxo set. Problem is a "wallet" can contain 1 or many addresses. If you know that it is just one address it is quite easy, even easier if it's all in one utxo. If it is a multi address wallet then unless you have a date for all the utxos  it is pretty much impossible.

@_date: 2019-02-11 02:36:13
well yes and no. you need a channel with "remote_balance". You can get that by having someone connect to you and commit a balance to you, as i did, or you can pay an invoice with your balance and it will shit funds and create remote balance. You will get random people setting up channels. I set up a channel with you so you should be able to to play around while your node becomes established and gets more incoming liquidity.

Quit claim deeds are to remove or transfer property without warranty. 
So called "title companies" are just insurance companies that will insure a warranty deed has no encumbrances. BTW they never pay out and are worthless. edit: the reason most transactions use them is because the bank requires it for the mortgage. When buying property with cash or now bitcoin there is no reason to. All liens against property have to be recorded with the county so all they do is do a lien check with the county.

There are a few nodes that will "connect back". You can search or browse on 1ml.com for those nodes. If you just wait you will probably pick up a few channels in the first week.

If this is critical, use child pays for parent. If not just wait.
Essentually you just spend the unconfirmed .05btc with a much higher fee, ie twice the fee you would if it had been confirmed. Depending on what wallet you are using, it may be easy or hard to isolate just that transaction. If you are using bitcoin core you would use "coin control" to isolate it.

Instead, your friend could generate CheckLockTimeVerify addresses for every month you owe him and you can send to them to each address at your leisure, knowing he cant spend them until the time.
If you have the coins just pay your friend now. If you dont have the coins you'll have to sign the transactions and really there is no way to do that as you dont know what utxo's you'll have in the future.
I guess you could also pre-sign the transactions but not broadcast them until the date. Just pay your friend back now is the easiest.

Could require the trader to trade directly through the node and only execute the trade if the transaction is signed immediately. Maybe minute auctions or something reasonable. The exchange would only need to hold the fiat.
Or have a small deposit to cover any change in price while the trader settles it manually. The exchange could then settle the trade on it's own if the trader doesnt settle it with a time frame or it eats up the deposit.

There is not much benefit to being an early node. The only significant benefit being, you are more likely to get incoming channels the longer your node is running. There is nothing prestigious about an early lightning node as there is nothing prestigious about an early bitcoin node.

What wallet is it? Different wallets calculate balance differently. examples would be: on chain balance, total channel balance and active/usable channel balance.

I understand where you are coming from, and yes it has some merit, but i look at the lightning locked capital more as "liquidity" than "market capital". It is more like the grease of the market.

You can start with this looking for your mount points and for your main drive/sd card having "ro" read only.
cat /proc/mounts
Guessing your setup as booting from sd card then mounting the external drive. Your "home" is on your sd card ie sda and probably being mounted with "ro" read only. This can also happen if the sd card has hardware errors. I can only guess what is wrong, wich is probably worse than not guessing.

If you only have channels to 1 node, the only activity you will see is your own. I assume you have a few channels now and yes that is normal.

Once you connect to a peer, your node will get a list of peers from them. Eventually your node will have a pretty good list of the public nodes. It's really just the first node that you connect to that matters. Don't know why the seed peers are not working on testnet for LND.

You'd have plenty of time to claim all the funds in the channel. The transactions are time locked. You can only close a channel instantly (without a time lock) if both channels cooperate. For example, I force closed a channel and now have to wait over a week for the transaction to be accepted to be included in a block. 
The process of the fraudulent node submitting a previous transaction, will give you the key to take all the funds in the channel with your own transaction before their timelocked transaction will be accepted.

Apparently blockchain.info has a public RPC, not sure about ZMQ socket.
It would be much easier just to run your own bitcoin node. You can do both with a raspberry pi.

Miners are probably sending these to "active" addresses when the mem pool is empty. They want you to eventually send them and collect the fee. You might want to check who mined the block that the transaction was included.

Not sure what you are asking. You should have received 100 sats in your lightning wallet, and you have 100 sats in the lntip bot too
@_date: 2019-05-09 15:43:04
Sound like a spotty wireless connection. If you are using wireless, i'd try a wired connection. also check vcgencmd get_throttled; vcgencmd measure_volts; to see if your power supply is adequate.

If you have access to your electrum wallet then you have access to your seed.
@_date: 2019-05-19 04:24:11
Best to use passphrase stored separately from your seed. Keep a small amount on the wallet without the passphrase for a couple reasons. i.e. Warning if your seed has been compromised or the $5 wrench attack.

Yes. The tip is with the lntipbot. If you look below you will see links to "more info" "balance" "deposit" and "withdraw". Your 100 sats are with the bot and you can tip others with it or withdraw. It's a good way to get familiar with lightning as you can send and receive with it.

Some 2.5A supplies are fine, some are not. I use these with 100% success so far. 
If you have a few supplies, try them out and check the throttled flag after booting. If it's 0x0 after booting, it should be fine.
