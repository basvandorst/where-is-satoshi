After reading comments here, plus more online research. I ordered the Trezor for £89 including postage. Thanks for the help!

Ok cool I'll  will look into this today. Why do people slag off coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:51:35
Perfect

I was leaning towards the nano s as it's the cheapest but still looks decent 
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:07:07
Which wallet would you guys recommend? I was going to get a nano s, but the reviews on amazon uk are pretty poor. Which wallets have multiple security protocols?

Cheers for this. Could be tempted to drop another g. Hahah

If you're referring to my comment about looks decent. That isn't about what it looks like, just means the product is good. English slang

Just ordered the trezor after doing more research. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-09-26 10:57:47
Thanks. Is there any major differences between the trezor and nano s?
@_date: 2017-09-26 10:25:39
Thanks for the advice. All bitcoin websites are giving it good reviews

Yeah I'm going to keep it hand written off line. Just have to hope my house doesn't burn down 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:38:28
Nice. Is it instant?
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:30:47
Yeah I know. It's pretty hard to get one in the UK right now 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:51:35
Perfect 
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:16:38
No it's definitely not an amount I'm happy to lose. It's more than a few coins. Thanks for the advice, I'll order than Nano s 
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:04:51
Yeah I will. It's around £65 including shipping from France. Will take quite a while to ship I think. Will order this weekend. I've been using copay on my mobile, which I know is not cool
