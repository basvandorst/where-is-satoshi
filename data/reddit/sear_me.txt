Because Socialism is apposite nationalism . its either this or that, There's no between when you want to defend one.
@_date: 2019-11-11 23:51:47
My point is seed is seed right? If lets say it gets bruteforced it would matter how many extra phasphare u had am i correct?
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:40:26
I used the calculator
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:07:19
Russian?  In fact those are the ones who want open borders.  
First world countries are raising their wall now. Socialism is dead. been dead for a while
@_date: 2019-11-09 00:52:41
He is behind almost every anti nationalist movements all over the world.  You can find his trace everywhere. i hope he stays away from bitcoin
@_date: 2019-11-01 23:20:02

@_date: 2019-11-11 23:39:04

@_date: 2019-11-12 00:02:07

@_date: 2019-11-01 22:18:36
Peak in economic sense means when a price hits and stays at specific target atleast 5 times and for more than 2 hours in business hours. 
Get in the know
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:20:51
This is to learn from the past and use it for future. so its not stupid. we can be in a similar situation now. Like.. in 10 years we say.. Imagine if we bought 0.01 bitcoin 10 years ago
@_date: 2019-11-08 01:10:23
He is that retarded.  See what bitcoin community is suffering  is this kind of people. USD will die. Banks will go down, World ends..
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:06:27
Because if you're willing your country to take many immigrants and open your border. then say whats wrong with nationalism. BTW world is goign toward more natioalism than ever
@_date: 2019-11-09 21:35:47
Yes and socialism brought Peace and prosperity just like Stalin who killed 20 millions,  or Mao or N.korea. or Mudoro or  fidel. yeh they were all natioalists :)

@_date: 2019-08-15 10:01:44
Well not evryone here is scammer. Some might really want to learn or stuff.
I once myself wanted to ask someone about how to trade. i could feel that he's thinkign im tryign to scam him. 
Some are just simply are looking for information
@_date: 2019-10-27 01:59:35
Currencies like ruble, peso in countries with nonstable economy which the value of  their currency can drop 20% with just a tweet from Trump... Adding those currencies to this calculator is not that easy

Long means buy order?
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:59:35
3 on the dot? what does it mean?
@_date: 2019-08-10 15:33:44
Look at reality.  if euro was catching up, the sanctions on iran would never work. Because EU is all the way behind iran's regime. USD dominance doesn't know percentage. Many countries tried to trade oil and other metal sources Via other  currencies. It never worked.  If you're going to ask why because almost all of Huge companies are in the US or them ones in the EU or world wide, have many Americans in them  which follow the US rules.
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:20:31
ok thx
@_date: 2019-10-12 12:24:47
what? lol
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:23:02
@_date: 2019-10-25 21:11:14
What is this for? only 150 bux raising in price
@_date: 2019-10-27 21:29:53
depends how much money we talking. if u wanna spend liek 100 200 bux. just buy now. if its more split it in 3 or 4.. for example if its 1000.  split by 5.  or 4.  Make 4 or 5 purchases each time price goes down. if it goes up. u wont lose anything if it goes down u still have some to buy more.
@_date: 2019-10-30 17:01:26
So you don't want it to go up, yet you're a bitcoin fan and want it to defeat fiat. isnt this beautiful?
@_date: 2019-10-08 00:29:25
This shitty posts about "end of fiat" is what keeps other people dont take bitcoin seriously.
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:55:54
U dont actually believe time travelling is possible do u? if u do go hospitalize urse;f
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:30:54
I dont understand some of users here. They talk about " fiat and USD dying"  all the time and keep talking nonsense bullshit that even a kid would laugh at them. And then when theres somethign positive like this on medium that has some source and reasons they talk bullshit again. 
SO make up your mind, are you with bitcoin or against bitcoin?  because what you're doing is very much against bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-20 18:08:31
Nope it doesnt work
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:51:12
@_date: 2019-10-28 12:59:04
Even in English speakign countries. People suffer to put away 300 bux a month to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-20 21:08:20
well 1 out of 1000 may work. but its still better than sitting on  their indian/filipino ass and do nothing. So yeah think of it as a hobby
@_date: 2019-10-31 01:19:22
why would some random skater boy joing btc 2020 be interesting?

@_date: 2019-10-15 12:13:01
Hes old news.
@_date: 2019-10-28 16:12:36
summarize: Fiat becomes worthless, BTC stays... blah blah... these things are the ones that make people look at bitcoin as a joke. Just like how you look at dumb feminists
@_date: 2019-10-27 00:47:32
Because this post was made this sub's od recently and changed the date to 6 years ago. If you dont believe goand try to find any of the IDs that commented, None of them exist or inactive
@_date: 2019-10-15 12:16:49
So my question. If mining is no good for no one. Then who should mine these bitcoins? Does bitcoin even work without mining?
@_date: 2019-10-30 18:00:29

Well there's a magic law in it ... As soon as u realize one investment is good, and u invest, it suddenly pauses or goes shit.  but at the same time exactly for someone who has not invested yet  it is a very good investment to do :)
@_date: 2019-10-12 10:47:01
Well i have a forum at a site with over tens of thousands members. We usually encounter such issues. Mostly by filipinos. So im talking out of experience
@_date: 2019-08-09 10:10:58
For sure when someone does something. ( specially as big a BTC) he will tell peopel around him. like family or close friends. wife or stuff.  So for sure some people know who he is

@_date: 2019-10-24 12:50:27
Well, You cant send yet if you just purchased.  Bitcoin now has a withdrawal limit of u to 10 days.
After that the withdraw option will be enabled for u. and you would see the button
You  can see that in your email that how many days you should wait.  you prolly didnt notice it in email they sent

SImple .. Just to get rich
@_date: 2019-10-27 16:25:49
my advice to you...  DCA costs patience and nerves. Just buy when u have money and put it away. Remember no one got rich without risks. U cant be comfy and yet become rich. so buys much a u can and put urself under pressure ( not your food money ) u will benefit later
@_date: 2019-10-27 21:39:03
 A NEw person or  buyer doesnt even know whats halving. so my question is how would it effect the price?
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:51:53
I stopped reading the second i saw " Fiat currency going down "
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:49:39
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:46:38
The Ledgerlive software has a thing inside that checks if the device is tempered, eachtime u conenct it. if it sees anything unusual it wont let it go through and will warn u.  
That was the hard part, 
U can still reset the device when buying to get a whole new private keys. 
otherwise don't worry about if they put something in it. Cuz they cant. Ledgerlive checks each time to see if its genuine

Printing more money to cover up  something = inflation. Have you seen any increase in price in stuff you buy in daily use over past 20 years? No
@_date: 2019-10-12 10:46:06
Well tbh after what happed to my friend im so negetive. If you could help me find her, that would be nice. We know her name and everything.  I remember back in time i tried to reach out to other filipinos for help, because they were speaking some local languages which no transaltor could translate it. But unfortunatley no one was willing to help.
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:02:34
i asked a analyser / charter if i should buy she said no at 7400.  now i regret it

@_date: 2019-10-29 07:10:09
Gold?! Lol let me guess u just watched that youtube video from that weird guy..
Gold is a metal and all valuable metals have many facotors changing price.  Just like Oil. Prud oil was $120 40 years ago, how much is it now? In fact it's Fiat that esitamtes gold price. Otherwise you can't say an ounce of gold worth one leg and 2 arms, or 4 bags of rice. can you? 
In a modern economy you only can compare A currency to another currency.  Apple with apple, orange with orange . ok?

@_date: 2019-12-05 22:52:49
How much were u supposed to withdraw?
@_date: 2019-12-18 23:11:35
nope  u can set malewares to use specific percentage or Cpu/GPU.  and victim is usually infected by browser. 
Sooo Lets say 30% of cpu of 1000 computers is good :)
@_date: 2019-12-19 12:58:35
So ur saying ledger is risky? Thats not good
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:14:07
So what do u suggest?
@_date: 2019-12-19 14:08:39
Yep its easy math. This sub has 1.3 million members. Lets say even if 100k are active. If 50k of them donate only  $1 in BTC  u will get 50k US dollar... Depends on your charmness tho lol
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:39:16
What do you use then?
@_date: 2019-12-23 22:40:53
Thanks. My only concern about Binance is they might freeze the account. As they dont seem as secure as coinbase
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:53:47
Thats wise words.  But i think the risk still worth it.  because if your investment is good, u can retire next year suddenly regarding how crazy bitcoin price can be
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:54:13
Why do u ask?
@_date: 2019-12-17 14:13:29
How do i get my tip?
@_date: 2019-12-20 10:15:18
Bitcoin is just simply bitcoin

Keep in mind only Frst world countries have negative interest rates. Like japab ib first place... Most Shtty countries have up to %30 interests rate just so they cab keep their banks open.

@_date: 2019-12-27 21:28:38
This pic talks alot...
There has been times we kept arguing that people should not Put Bitcoin against Free countries with good Economies. Like USA.  
But these people insist that bitcoin works against democracy. This pic proves that Bitcoin is the enemy of dictatorships who want to control everything, Yet they use it themself for personal business.. 
I think bitcoin stays at this stage for a while. 
I mean NO dictatorship country like Venezuela, iran, N korea can use it to skip the US sanctions. Yet people of these countries can use it to skip the government monitoring .
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:25:28

Age range here is 22 - 55.  Mostly.  its wrong thinking everyone who is into bitcoin is younger. bitcoin is not all that new anyway.

Speaking of Kucain.  I had a accoutn there with some alts...  Since i lost my phone i lost access they wanted me to prove with a video and such, i have yet to send it.  I think Coinbase is safer to keep BTC in

I read about coincard now... First lines are red flag to me. They say check if the bag is fully sealed and stuff like that...
Thats bad...
Atleast in Ledger thesoftware itself checks for hardware being legit or tampered..
