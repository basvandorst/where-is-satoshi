This guy just wants free BTC showing off his QR address, don’t fall for ir

If you think your Coinbase acc is secure with 2FA and all you don’t really need to use another wallet

Facebook is filled with misleading ads, I even saw an ads for illicit steroids lol
@_date: 2019-11-25 20:02:00
I thought Bill Gates was shorting Bitcoin ��
@_date: 2019-11-13 20:25:34
Coinbase have very high fees as well
@_date: 2019-11-12 00:30:17
By the end of 2020 or?
@_date: 2019-11-12 00:34:24
That would be great, let’s see.. I think we’ll see 20k May 2021 one year after halving
@_date: 2019-10-29 22:12:32
Very unlikely
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:18:30
Who the fuck trades for 1b on their shitty platform. That’s one expensive ass road to 1b.. they’ve taken like half once you get there
@_date: 2019-02-24 18:23:00
I wonder what is the cause of major changes like this
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:41:01
I bought around 4K usd at 8300, I’m not really that affected, I don’t know why I care so much when I’m accumulating and holding long term. ����‍♂️

Well here in Denmark the cost of electricity would be about 100 dollars for 300 kwh, so 100 dollars to make 30 dollars
@_date: 2019-10-07 22:46:18
I think we got a whale here
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:40:09
In hindsight, I think the price would have dropped a little anyways.. Bitcoin always goes parabolic then corrects afterwards
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:52:38
Western Union should be banned and everyone should be taught crypto
@_date: 2019-12-07 01:41:56
I could have said that as well, but I also wanted to voice my opinion on how stupid I think those games are, and how much greediness is behind them.
@_date: 2019-12-10 04:19:56
You’ll be a fraction of a millionaire

I buy my BTC on kraken.com which is one of the oldest exchanges out there, but there’s also Coinbase but the fees are higher there.
Just buy right now at around $7200 USD or something, might go even lower.. even though it just went up to 7600 it’s probably gonna go down again. Or just buy now, I would say the current price is pretty cheap. I bought most of mine at 8300.
Yes you can own 0.001 btc etc

Probably HODL till I die then forget to give the private keys to my remaining family..

That is probably the stupidest thing I’ve read this week. No one should spend money on freemium games.. You’re basically throwing your money out of the window
@_date: 2019-12-07 01:04:34
Freemium games are more stupid though.. at least at a bar you can maybe meet new people and progress socially. But yeah I agree any waste of money is stupid, I do my best to save mine.
@_date: 2019-12-11 22:12:44
I guess crypto is still to complicated for some people, also Western Union basically do all the handling of transferring the money, which also requires them to have bank accounts in various countries throughout the world.
@_date: 2019-12-07 01:09:22
True, all I’m doing really is try to give some financial advice. If you want to save up and invest, don’t spend money now, invest now and have even more money in the future that’s what I’m trying to say. Just some advice
@_date: 2019-12-04 20:21:04
Lol. This is current day me talking to my 2015 self who bought pizzas and other stuff for BTC.. At least I used it like it was designed to
@_date: 2019-04-27 20:52:11
Haha seal laugh funny
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:32:01
It’s a carpet lol
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:32:32
Actually you could buy coins a while ago which actually had a code inside for BTC
@_date: 2019-01-18 00:46:02
The “real ones” are usually pressed in the Netherlands
@_date: 2019-01-18 00:39:23
They still exist? Last time I tried em was in 2014, that’s when I did my share of x pills 
@_date: 2019-01-17 23:45:49
High quality, but old pills.. I’ve taken the White Domino’s, Gold Bars and a white version of the Red Bugatti’s.. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 16:38:25
I thought this was real and sent him the bitcoin.. Like how would he know my masturbation video was named Admin.mp4.. That’s what I name my masturbation vids because I’m such an admin/boss at masturbating.
@_date: 2019-01-09 20:08:29
Wouldn’t trust one of those machines, especially when I don’t understand a word and it’s in the Czech Republic, it’s cool tho
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:48:53
I could have been rich if I hadn’t used bitcoins for my drug habit
@_date: 2019-05-10 22:20:47
When you would’ve bought months ago but you can barely pay for food/rent
