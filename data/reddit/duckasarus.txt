@_date: 2018-11-24 23:08:38

@_date: 2018-11-24 12:53:20

@_date: 2018-02-14 18:24:44
Market will Be correcting soon if it steadies out above 9,500. Hold it will go up

I think at this point the meme about bitcoin hitting 5000 might happen 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:32:41
 Donating a bitcoin to shroud is so cool. I can’t believe someone donated 12,000 dollars. Cause 10,000 dollars is a lot of money like what would you do with 8,000 dollars?

Wanna see me run to 7500 and back? Wanna see me do it again?

In the time it toke to make that edit it hit 7.5 k than bounced back so funny 
@_date: 2018-07-21 03:42:58
Would be funny if their wallets were flagged 
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:38:47
Remember to eat it and not save it! Gotta spend to increase

For some people they’ve been waiting 10 years. You’ve waited about 5 months. Patience 
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:04:55
I call posting it next if it falls
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:20:13
I was joking lol. Lemme put a /s
@_date: 2018-12-21 05:05:29
Doesn’t even matter it’s all profit... 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:22:21
$500 here we go. I feel bad for the people who made the graphs of the percentage falls like the drop is gonna stop. And I feel good for the people bragging that it’s not gonna fall any harder
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:16:30
This about to be the second time you bought at 1000 /s
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:19:46
Anything is possible. Good luck in your future investing/life endeavors
