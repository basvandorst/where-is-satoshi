here's another question... I've always feared key loggers so for years I always cut/paste passwords/etc to avoid that issue. Is memory board data hackable.  btw.. are you familiar with the Bitcoin Gold Core blockchain. I'm hoping to claim BTG from this blockchain since the hardfork in November.

My decision was to buy several ounces of gold with BTC as their value increased. This was my fail-safe should BTC tumble and the gold is buried in the backyard, aka cold storage.... ;o]

The vanishing 20BTC saga continues...
It occurred those coins were in the electrum wallet at the BCH hardfork which I managed to claim. A month later those same coins were there at the BTG hardfork which I never did figure how to claim. I am now in the process of downloading what's called the Bitcoin Gold Core blockchain in the hopes of claiming the 20BTG to salvage at least that. Any suggestions?

You're right. I was suggesting hackers are more likely to go after the big money rather than penny coins... but I'm looking for a slow and steady type value rise rather than what are being touted shooting for the moon which would probably attract the attention of hackers. btw... I was thinking of using the same reasoning with exchanges... lesser known rather than the most popular...

lesson learned.
Since BTC is the target of hackers, probably it's more secure to store BTC in some other form... aka gold.... altcoins... cash...

dec27 there were 20BTC in my electrum wallet. dec28 the wallet content was reduced to 0=zero by one transaction to public address 1USAA......2YTv
I went to blockexplorer.com to trace that transaction to find 790 confirmations verifying that transaction....
What happened?

those 20BTC were bought in 2014 so a ton of money to have ripped off.... How do I recover them? tnx for any help

one thing I did not mention... at the same time those 20BTC evaporated, the 0.1BTC in an Exodus wallet evaporated to the same address. Understand my confusion?

Right... the electrum wallet installed on a stand alone memory stick is "my own bank" but a trezor wallet installed on their proprietary memory stick is a more secure "my own bank"...
reality check.... both memory sticks connect to the blockchain to verify transactions.
