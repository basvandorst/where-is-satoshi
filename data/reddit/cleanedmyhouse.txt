I'll say this, I would NEVER ever ever send a sum that large as my 2nd transaction  with a website.

That's not what I mean. One of the rules of thumb is never buy more than you can afford to lose. IMO if you're ready to sell off your wedding dress, especially on a gamble, you aren't ready to invest. But, It's not my dress or my wife's. So obviously it's all about what it means to you. For me, I'd rather cut back on everything and start a savings for what I want to put into BTC. Then if you lose it all, you still paid your bills, and you still have that dress or whatever item you WERE ready to cash out for BTC. Again, that's just an opinion.

I would never sell anything with serious sentimental value for a volatile cryptocurrency, but I'm also just now learning so.......

You just made some money if that's what you're asking. You will get however much bitcoin you purchased yesterday but it will be worth more today.

You’re telling us they aren’t swamped? Do you have a source? Hard to believe that your one situation determines that an entire company isn’t behind.

And that's the golden crypto rule, if Binance crashes it will be a sad day but I will wake up the next day and go to work just like always.

You think these threads will help determine the future of btc?

But he also thought he put out hits on several people. He really wasn’t a good person anymore.

Yes Zuck has never been set up and caught in an attempt to assassinate an old partner.

Really don’t see why this is posted in the BTC sub. If anything btc needs to distance itself from the dark net. Ross isn’t a hero, my take from the book is that he turned into something dark and he DEFINITELY did some fucked up shit besides selling drugs.
