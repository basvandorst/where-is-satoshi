Cool story.

Ah. Cool. I just thought most of these places were cashing in on the hype but then just stopped accepting it when the markets went south. 
I’ve still yet to buy an everyday item with crypto.

Okay so what makes you think governments would adopt BTC as the new global currency? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:31:18
I don’t think it works like that.

Indeed am. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:30:57
Does it? Got any evidence to support that?

Except it isn’t is it. 
Bitcoin market cap is approximately $100billion
The top 5 wealthiest people on earth far surpass that. 
What is the total wealth of the 0.1%? (7000 people) ?
There are 1500 billionaires in the world which means a combined wealth of at least $1.5 trillion (assuming a net worth of only 1 billion)
Let’s say the remaining 5500 people only have a wealth of $20million with a combined total of $110billion, about the same as the total market cap for bitcoin. 
I fail to see how there is a wealth “transfer” when the worlds wealthiest people literally dwarf bitcoin, it’s just being getting more money.

The value of USD and other currencies went down RELATIVE to the bitcoin. The value of the fiat currencies relative to things you can buy (which is what matters) stayed the same. 
 
The value of bitcoin is still tied to fiat, people will continue to compare its value to fiat for quite a while.

Don’t tell anyone? Just convert to fiat and withdraw and look like everyone else maybe? Can’t be that hard to travel “with” bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:10:46
Isn’t that the same thing? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:09:33
Unless bitcoin replaced fiat then I don’t see how there would be a wealth transfer.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:15:30
But the world isn’t using bitcoin like fiat yet. It’s like saying the value of everything has gone down relative to apple shares. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:44:29
Riiiight.

Apply pay is just another method of payment of fiat currency.

I went to some place in Vietnam called “bitcoin cafe” or something and they had logos for all kinds of crypto on the wall which I thought was great.... didn’t actually accept any crypto though. 
So my point being all these places might look great but in reality they probably don’t even accept crypto. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 09:26:22
And what makes you think they’d actually do that? 
Just sounds wishy washy to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:23:16
All currencies haven’t gone down 10% because I can still buy stuff with the same amount of money. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:11:04
Actually, it did take place.
But believing this comment shows our herd mentality, we don't even check if its true, we believe it without checking.
Can't fool me.
