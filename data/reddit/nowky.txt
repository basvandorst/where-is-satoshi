No it's always 100% gaurenteed to go up and anyone who doesn't invest their life savings before it replaces fiat is an idiot /s

Wanna buy some bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:36:30
That's not very balanced
@_date: 2019-08-05 00:27:59
But that's the only reason to like Dogecoin. It's not like he's wrong
@_date: 2019-08-12 18:27:39
Oh, I was agreeing with you/adding to your point

Guess it depends on the extent of homelessness and how he was spending his time in that decade.

He said in a tweet he was paying off his college loans. Imagine thinking this was a bad idea just because he didn't predict the future. Might as well call out every person on this sub who didn't buy bitcoin with their entire life savings at 10 cents and then sell at 15k+. It's no different than this guy selling it

You are missing a lot of stocks right now that will have insane gains. You could just pull up any stock that climbs and say "ugh missed out"

"Hey let's make a subreddit about bitcoin and then be unhelpful to its subscribers" 
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:42:24
So you don't want bitcoin to be used as a currency?
@_date: 2019-02-24 13:45:21
Oh shoot son, I thought you were the first person I was replying to. Yes, my bad
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:44:36
Yeah excellent HINDSIGHT
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:41:28
A) No, I don't believe in it in the long run as a currency, but if people don't then it loses its value. (I personally think it's in a bubble)
B) It can be adopted as a niche type of currency. Dark web for example. Just because crypto isn't a global currency doesn't mean it isn't a currency.

Cash it out a little at a time after the initial WD
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:55:29
Probably cash out enough to live off of well, while leaving enough in to reap benefits
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:11:44
Yeah and like bitcoin cash showed, you can get REALLY lucky. He came out with a lot of profit to show for it. And opportunity cost =/= lost money, just a loss of potential profit. Completely different. You could sell your house and every asset you own for bitcoin but you don't. Doesn't mean you are losing money.

@_date: 2019-12-08 13:36:24
Yeah but to be fair the Cartel (and others) only function because of cash
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:51:08
Bought at 7100, then again at 5800 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:10:53
There's a fair point. Although with a lot of newcomers coming to this subreddit, people probably shouldn't be making misleading claims.
@_date: 2019-02-24 06:03:31
Let people have fun? How about we give solid advice to people who could potentially feel swayed to invest money they can't afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:47:49
This never happened
@_date: 2019-02-24 06:45:54
Yeah but I don't see why you are actively telling other redditors not to advise people against getting too hyped. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:23:18
It's not guaranteed by any means but it's definitely possible due to the hype at the moment
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:53:55
Difference between a good idea and perfect foresight.
@_date: 2019-12-11 16:22:15
To some people that hassle is called "having a good time"
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:08:58
Sort of, what I would do (I'm no expert) would be to cash out a significant profit to live off of, and leave enough to continue profiting off
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:50:12
It has uses, but the idea that it WILL replace currency is delusional. The idea that it could have a chance is at least understandable, even though its more likely to fill various niches. I don't understand how the economy benefits by switching to another currency that will already be primarily in the hands of early adopters  doing nothing to shift the imbalance of wealth. But it's hilarious to see this sub call economists idiots because they derive their expectations from an echo chamber. I have some in crypto because it could go up and has utility, but if it crashes these people will be in financial ruin while trying to blame the system.
