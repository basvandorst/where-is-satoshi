Bitcoin is only one of hundreds of blockchains, don't count your chickens too much that these people are going to pay you money as a holder of Bitcoin for this.

More people distrust and laugh at dogecoin so it's the one that will succeed, right?
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:29:28
Cool, now a 51% attack can really mess up bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-11 00:43:22
Neither does hustler or wordpress and tiger direct still accepts them but has this weird old page about butterfly labs and GPU mining and a message that pops up saying the deal has ended if you go looking for bitcoin information.

Basically it's a good way for you to use your resources to help people that are richer than you not spend their resources to do it.

Satoshi said vision was to premined 10% of the coins then leave, stop worshipping him

How does being slow make you think you have more money exactly? Anyone that could check their Bitcoin balance could also check their bank balance and know exactly how much money they have.
@_date: 2015-06-11 02:30:47
It seems like you could have done that with literally any digital currency of any type, not just bitcoin. WoW gold or Eve isk or whatever would have the exact same story, nothing particular to the specific properties of bitcoin allowed that. A centralized system would have been just as effective for you.

If you celebrate difficulty as a big achievement all you do is set it up as a crisis if it goes down in the future. Celebrating difficulty as security means having to talk about loss of security if this pops

Where do you get that garbage? What data are you using that bandwidth grows at 50% per year? What group's internet are you talking about? You just made that number up whole cloth.

Crying about time magazine is how you are spinning this huge embarrassing failure?

At one point the idea was bitcoin would not have economic problems that needed solving later on by people messing with it.

It's hilarious that the great libertarian money experiment runes entirely off people working as volunteers.

There is no actual sign bitcoin is growing exponentially. It shrunk a ton after mt gox and hasn't really recovered yet.
@_date: 2015-06-11 23:42:31
The fact the debate exists shows bitcoin isn't really any different than the old systems, it still has to have people making economic decisions and isn't the pure mathematical perfect money the early users believed.  
@_date: 2015-06-12 00:04:52
How come things like bit torrent could spread and be popular without this sort of thing? 
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:25:34
The utility is diffusion of responsibility. It gives people a way to victim blame when bad things happen with a dumb "hurr hurr, shouldnt'a trusted beta software" when bitcoin eventually collapses. 
It will never EVER come out of beta. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 00:41:31
Do we actually know that coinbase is making any money? As far as we know they are just floating on VC which is barely a step up from a business model of taking out a bunch of bank loans. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 17:08:55
Okay, if you say so, but maybe don't be so quick to assume that blockchain means bitcoin when that isn't actually true. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:18:08
I get more money, they get less money

Expect this question to be downvoted away. It's too hard a question.

Watch this thread get "community managed"

That isn't how economics actually work though. The halfing is halfing the additional supply not the entire supply. It will mean the price FALLS half as fast, not that it will double. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:05:21
Yeah but 5 years ago satoshi himself said it was time to go to 1.3 and he was ignored.

six years has found only 750,000 users, so yeah, low interest

No one here really wants to help greece. They want to have greece drive up the price so the users here can sell and get rich and leave greece a bunch of bag holders. (which won't actually happen)

The fees were supposed to be that but the fees turned out to be so low they don't really do anything.

Once they move onto the blockchain you won't be able to censor them so easy

The price is barely up. Are you making big euphoria posts over less than ten dollars now?
@_date: 2015-06-18 01:31:56
I think the fact there are so many known attacks and none of them are happening proves governments and banks don't care one bit about bitcoin
@_date: 2015-06-13 02:49:11
You are right, decentralization isn't something the public wants
@_date: 2015-06-11 01:46:12
Oh no, they haven't changed anything and that is what I am referencing, their page seems to be a weird forgotten relic of a forgotten era. It's the space jam website of bitcoin. 
"Like many things, mining for bitcoins can be quite easy or very hard. But today we have a fairly simple solution for you provided by Butterfly labs!
Butterfly labs offers bitcoin mining hardware which you plug into your PC and you run the software that is provided. You specify your wallet address so that your bitcoins can be sent to you! It’s that easy."
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:30:33
It would be ignored because bitcoin people think it lets them have their cake and eat it too, even though it really doesn't. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:48:40
The most faithful hope to sell their coins to bitpay who will give dollars to companies so they can pretend they "bought things with bitcoin" and pretend they didn't just sell all their bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:46:26
If they put money into Bitcoin I plan to take that money right back out and so do lots of people. It wouldn't be a good deal for them but it'd make me rich
@_date: 2015-06-11 00:23:03
Volume is tiny compared to a few months ago. This chart has lots of issues you can pick at but it's got the right idea: 
The amount of trading has falled 99% since it's peak and is the lowest amount since before the big 2013 price spike. 
Price can't change very much if bitcoin sales just simply aren't happening. It's stagnation as much as it's stability.
