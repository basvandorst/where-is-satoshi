First, you shouldn't keep your coins on an exchange.
2FA isn't a silver bullet, it just makes an attack much harder to do because you have to compromise multiple things at once.
I strongly suggest using a private bitcoin wallet where you know you control the keys to your coins. To do so, I also recommend using Airbitz, which has 2FA built-in the app already while automatically encrypting and backing up your wallet safely.

@_date: 2016-08-09 17:59:17
The app encrypts all the wallet data to the device automatically, so whatever information access granted to the app is still secure and private.

This is big. With security and encryption being at a pivotal crossroads in the general public and the growing about of databases being comprimised, this solution of Edge-Security Airbitz provides is a great for projects that want to protect user privacy. Kudos to the Airbitz Team! Can't wait to see the apps built off this technology.

Airbitz is my favorite wallet precisely because of all the useful, practical services you can access from within the wallet. 
Also, the security and privacy they've built-in are very important to me.
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:24:07

@_date: 2016-04-05 13:46:09
I've been saying this for awhile. BC.info is way behind the innovation curve now. They take their first-to-market position for granted.
I recommend [Airbitz]( to everyone as a must have bitcoin wallet, especially newbies because it's easy to use and very secure.

Their latest release is finally decent... but they've had problems in the past and IMO it took way too long for them to catch up on all the wallet innovations and security features such as HD-addresses.
It was my first wallet, but I moved to [Airbitz]( a while ago because of their focus on privacy and security and ease of use.
@_date: 2016-04-12 05:20:48
Just to be clear, you didn't list any bitcoin wallets. Circle, Coinbase, Xapo are all bitcoin banks.

This is what I call the "Ver fallacy", the notion that core contributors dictate network consensus. That's backwards, consensus dictates the network development. And while Luke is a prolific core contributor, he hardly dictates the direction of the bitcoin network. 
This is decentralized network, there is no 'leadership', there is no stifling innovation, that's not how any of this works. The network is free to shift to another protocol with different consensus rules... yet it hasn't. So you have to face the fact that consensus is dictating the blocksize remaining at 1mb, at least so far.
While the network congestion and fees are troublesome &amp; frustrating, finding someone like Luke to blame is convenient but ridiculous and politicizes the real issue, which is that all the network participates need to utilize SegWit and LN and all these other tools that help make the network function better/faster. If Bread wallet and other companies are not going to follow consensus, then they should consider using a different network.

Technically no SegWit didn't "need" to be on mainnet, but practically speaking, it kinda did. From the core devs perspective, they poured alot of effort into SegWit, then tested it for a year just to have it stalled for almost a year after that. Why would they rush to develop more layers on a stack when the base layer isn't set yet? 
It was very possible SegWit never got consensus, then they'd have to go back to the drawing board on that. 
The logical, responsible thing to do was to wait.

Airbitz is a great choice. They're new "Edge Secure" wallet, which is currently in beta, will be able to accept a variety of alt coins as well. 
Using an iPad to accept payments is probably the easiest. Using Bitpay has become very cumbersome. If you plan on cashing out (I encourage hodling), Airbitz has a few different exchange options connected through their wallet you can use. So it's really all you need.
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:56:48
We can thank the delaying SegWit activation by a certain cadre of miners. We'd likely already have a fully operational LN on mainnet.

For your purposes, you're going to want an wallet where you control the keys 100%, and that changes addresses every time you spend or receive bitcoin (for security purposes). 
I'd highly recommend [Airbitz]( (for either iOS or Android). Feels like mobile banking but you are your own bank. Simply create a username &amp; password of your choosing and that's it! Airbitz encrypts all your wallet information and backs up your encrypted wallet for you automatically to their network. That way if your device is ever lost, stolen or damaged, you simply get a new device, download the app and login the same way. Super easy, lots of other features.
@_date: 2015-06-08 14:59:52

Check out (Airbitz)[ Stand alone wallet where you control 100% of your keys. They have auto-encryption &amp; auto-backup with a username/password of your choice (no 12 random words to write down). Loaded with features no other wallet offers (bitcoin directory, add metadata to transactions, one-touch 2fa for added security, NFC &amp; BLT transactions capable). Plus they will soon enable buy/sell from within the wallet.
Circle &amp; Coinbase are more like bitcoin banks, not wallets. Remember they have full access to your funds.

Coinmap isn't reliable. Check on [Airbitz](
@_date: 2015-06-25 13:45:11
Venmo or G-Wallet are bank accts, you have to give all your personal information and sync your bank acct in order to let them transfer and hold your money. 
This is not the case with Airbitz.
@_date: 2015-06-12 20:22:15
Yeah you'd want the full address to verify on the blockchain. Although there is always still a level of trust in the coin maker not holding the privKEY. I'm not sure any other physical coin maker has the rep Casascius did.

Up to 20% off Starbucks.

@_date: 2018-08-26 03:26:58
Well, if it's encrypted client-side, meaning the user is the only one that can decrypt it... then not really. The user experience 'feels' like a hosted wallet even though it's not, which is what make Edge preferrable IMO.
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:29:55
Well both are popular because they give the user complete control of their funds. It's simply a matter of preference in what you're looking for your wallet to do for you.
**Airbitz** 
* Auto encryption/backup of wallet data to distributed network (in case your device is lost or stolen, simply download the app on a new device and login and you're wallet and funds are there.) 
* Available on Android platform too (you can sync same wallet across platform devices). 
* Built-In 2 factor authentication (for added security) 
* Password recovery process (optional) 
* Create multiple wallet accounts within the same wallet 
* Add meta data to transactions 
* Send payment requests via Email &amp; SMS 
* Built-in Bitcoin directory (see all the places near you that accept bitcoin) 
* (Coming Soon) Built-in buy/sell from exchange. 
**Breadwallet** 
* Straight forward bitcoin wallet. Send/Receive done. 
* Uses 12 word seed (which you need to write down and keep in safe storage) 
* SPV payments (talks straight to the blockchain)

That's what Edge Wallet is. It's a secure, private wallet that 'feels like' a hosted wallet, but it's not. Requires no personal information.  
They also use an encryption scheme to do automatic backups so you only have to use a Username &amp; Password to decrypt back to a device. AND you can turn on 2FA that's built into the wallet so you can lock your wallet to a specific device. Highly recommend.
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:33:08
Correct. They're actually one of the most secure and private wallets.
@_date: 2018-08-12 02:16:57
Just use EDGE wallet. Your balance is hidden until you hit "Show balance".  
You should also only keep a relatively small amount in a spendable wallet.

I donated to Adrian Wyllie running for Gov of FL (bitcoin/litecoin miner).
And Lucas Overby running for Congressional House in FL District 13 (Initiating a blockchain secured Congressional voting  transparency project). 
(They both spoke at the Disney Conference - Coins in the Kingdom a few weeks ago 
It's too bad the community doesn't see the value of supporting candidates that could advocate for us instead of leaving it up to incumbents that do not understand this technology and probably never will.
Lucas Overby in particular could have been the first libertarian candidate in US history because there was no Democrat opponent to the Republican incumbent that Lucas could easily beat with financial support.  My thought was, "what if the bitcoin community could get Lucas elected"?  We would not only be sending a strong message to Washington (literally), but we'd be making US History by having the first Libertarian in Congress with the help of Bitcoineers.
I guess there is still this weekend though.

Check out [Airbitz]( app. They actually do quality control and contact the owners before listing on their directory. By using your geolocation, they find all the bitcoin accepting places closest to you, show pictures of the place, give you detailed info (phone number, website, bio, hours of opp, ect...).
The directory is apart of their amazing wallet too, so you can't go wrong getting the app (iOS &amp; Android).
@_date: 2017-02-16 01:59:41

This is brilliant! I would love to see a monthly TLDR of r/bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 06:23:01
IMO Airbitz is better. High in security and in functionality. Auto-matically encrypts and backs up your wallet with a Username/Password/Pin. Has built in plugin services such as buy/sell, and giftcards for Target and Starbucks (when available).
The difference between these wallets and Coinbase is the difference of who owns the access to spend your btc. With Coinbase, you need their approval. With these other private wallets, you have direct control and access to your btc.
It's the difference between holding your money in the bank or cash in your wallet. With bitcoin, it's very easy for these 'banks' to loose or steal your bitcoin... although Coinbase has a stellar record in that regard and are insured. But best practice is for you to own your keys.
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:34:38
Miners are in control, but that doesn't mean bitcoin users can't provide incentives.
I think creating a "SegWit bounty" via a smart contract that supporters donate to might be the incentive miners need. The bounty would go to the first miner to confirm a block after SegWit is activated. This would show miners what the community wants and provide the extra incentive for them to start signaling. 
The greater the bounty, the more likely and more quickly SegWit is activated and bitcoin scales without HF risk.
PM me if you want to help make this happen.
@_date: 2015-05-29 13:03:03
This would be my guess too. Bitpay also has private investors they use to liquidate on their end.

To be clear, Airbitz *is* a standalone wallet app, that is you can send/receive bitcoin without Airbitz's servers.
Airbitz (the company) just provides a unique service that allows user's wallets to be auto-encrypted, auto-backed up and sync between devices to increase the usability and familiarity to the average person so it's much easier for users who aren't use to storing 24-word seeds for bitcoin wallets.
@_date: 2017-02-02 14:13:28

All addresses that your wallet has generated in the past can always be used because they're generated from the same private keys. So they're always valid. However, it's best practice that you use a new address for every transaction for privacy and security reasons (Airbitz does this automatically for you). 
I know it seems a little strange to do that, but it's because all bitcoin transactions are public on the blockchain, therefore analysis can be done to link your ID to your wallet address, and you don't want that because you become a target for hackers.

Airbitz [ 
Feels like mobile banking, 100% control of your keys. Auto-encrypts and back-ups so you don't have to worry about loosing your funds even if you loose/break your device.
Will soon be able to buy/sell directly from the wallet as well.

Coinbase is not a wallet, it's a regulated exchange which requires KYC/AML, they've been known to lock accounts and refuse withdraws until you answer a questionnaire as to what your spending bitcoin on and go through a more indepth verification process.

I've heard they do that, but it may depend on where you live. Not sure about that.

Exactly what I thought. Thanks to Airbitz w/ FoldApp I protect myself at Starbucks AND Target from thieves and hackers taking CC info.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:19:16


This seems kinda vague. Can you elaborate what determines which chain is the 'winning' chain? What time-frame is 'long term' in such case?
It's unfortunate that such contingency plans need to be in place for bitcoin exchanges in the first place, but it does make sense given the lack of consensus and clear division.

@_date: 2017-03-21 06:33:18


Core *has* provided a solution that prevents a network split, it's called SegWit via a soft-fork. Why do I keep hearing this when a hard-fork by definition *is* splitting the network... yet you're accusing Core of doing the very they've prevented with SegWit. It's backwards.


Wut? This is bitcoin... there is no 'leadership'! Satoshi left, bitcoin still goes on... Gavin stops, bitcoin goes on..., Hearn left, bitcoin goes on...


I agree with that to a degree. The problem is this technical issue has been politicized by certain personalities demonizing developers whom do not control consensus of the network as if they're to blame for everything. It's ridiculous and fallacious reasoning.


Like bitcoin supporting both on-chain and off-chain scaling solutions the way SegWit does?

This always seemed clear to me. I've heard supporters of BU take 2 positions on HF.
1. They claim hard forks are "better" because they're not confusing and are more inclusive (whatever that means).
2. That HF isn't really that bad, if bitcoin forks, then both "sides" get the bitcoin they want to support.
The tactic seems to muddy the waters in terms of what a HF actually is and then obfuscate the technical risks involved or to completely ignore these dangers and blindly accept HF as a good thing even if bitcoin splits.
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:32:37
True, but at least it shows a clear enough difference between the devs and their contributions. The point is Blockstream doesn't "control" Core.
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:56:11
I think saying it means 'nothing', is a bit of an overstatement. It means something, whether the signal itself reflects the true intentions of the miner or not, we know that BU is getting at least some level of support that is preventing SegWit activation.
But I get the point being made...consensus takes much more than what code base the miners decide to run.
Also, I think OP points out an interesting BU attack vector that I've also considered. BU could be derailed if anti-BU miners untruthfully signal for BU inflating their 'consensus' giving them a false sense of support which might encourage them to try to fork.. but if they try to fork with only 45% actual support, they'll build an empty chain to a dead end.

Breadwallet is a good wallet for iOS. However, I would at least checkout Airbitz, which offers the same privacy and security with a whole lot of other features no other wallet offers. 
Even if/when Breadwallet fixes their issues, Airbitz is just a must have app for any bitcoiner. Built-in btc directory, tag transactions with Metadata, Auto-encryption/backup/sync with Edge-Security model, export TX file to spreadsheet, One touch-2FA, dynamic mining fees... I could go on but it's user preference.
@_date: 2019-03-26 05:34:18
Obviously it's not because of fees, BTC has historically low fees right now.  
This usually happens when they plan on creating their own crypto. That's my guess.

Coinbase is not a wallet, it's a bank/exchange.

@_date: 2016-06-20 13:32:34
That depends on what you want.
Coinbase is more like a bank, they hold your funds, they control your keys. They're responsible for security.
Private wallets, like Airbitz, allow you to have complete control of your keys. You're responsible for security.
@_date: 2016-06-18 01:39:00
Airbitz (the wallet) is still functional for bitcoin transactions independently of Airbitz (the company). You'll have limited features (such as the bitcoin directory service and auto-backup/sync), but you're funds (keys) will always be accessible on your device no matter what.
@_date: 2016-06-30 03:18:34

SegWit doesn't seem to be aligning the incentives for enough miners to get the critical mass it needs. If miners act based on incentives, then there needs to be something to tip that incentive over the top.
How about a SegWit-bounty? The miner/pool who produces the first block AFTER SegWit is fully activated wins the bounty.
Anyone can donate btc to the bounty to increase the incentive. Eventually it'll reach a point where we the community makes the bounty attractive enough that miners are incentivized to signal SegWit in hopes to win the bounty. Thoughts?
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:13:01
I'm also wondering the same. It seems to me it would make spam attacks ineffective or at least dampen the effects of them.
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:47:09
Given the Edge-Security model Airbitz has employed in their wallet structure, I feel extremely comfortable and secure that my bitcoin are safe. I trust their user friendly approach to auto-encrypt &amp; backup then I do trusting myself writing the privKey down and hiding it somewhere. 
I would highly recommend using 2FA and also use fingerprint login if your phone is capable (you'll find these options in the settings).
Def look at hardware wallets as well for cold storage, just beware of the possible risks there as well. Don't loose your keys.
@_date: 2016-06-18 01:45:34
You can always write down (or download) the private seed to any of the HD wallets you create within Airbitz... just incase.
But Airbitz's distributed backup architecture is built to be fault tolerant... so it's unlikely to go down, but always good to be on the safe side.

Just to be clear, the BTC does not live on your device, the keys to your BTC live on your device. There is a difference. Think of it like this, the blockchain is a line of lock boxes each with bitcoins locked in them. Your private keys are what enables you to unlock bitcoins from those boxes to spend them. If you control those keys, those bitcoins are yours (private wallets like Airbitz, Mycellium, Breadwallet, Copay, Electrum ect). If you do not control those keys, someone else has control of those bitcoins (these are custodial wallets like Coinbase, Circle, all exchanges).
Rule  of crypto: Control your keys.

Of coarse not, which is why I recommended a bitcoin wallet that is ranked among the best at privacy and security and only gives the user control of their keys and not a bitcoin bank like Coinbase or Circle.
It sounds like you're implying Airbitz has control over their user's funds, which is not the case at all but I'm curious why you think that?
@_date: 2016-11-04 21:04:47


Airbitz uses HD wallets. Whether or not Airbitz's security model is 'weaker' depends on how well people currently properly manage their seed backups. People are notoriously horrible at security management, and storing a backup on paper has it's own security flaws and risks too.
I personally don't trust myself to manage a bunch of seeds on paper, so Airbitz is a great solution that takes care of that for me.
Of coarse, even with Airbitz you can always store your private seed on paper just as well as any other wallet if you choose to for those doomsday scenarios.
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:19:00
This is why I use Airbitz.

You can do a Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transaction, meaning you basically do the same transaction with a higher tx fee, the higher fee tx will get confirmed first, so the original tx either gets rejected or falls off the mem pool.

You're not understanding how Airbitz works. It 'feels' like a login-wallet, but it's actually using that login info to decrypt your private keys that are on your device (generated when you opened the wallet for the first time). You don't need a recovery seed with Airbitz because they make the process easier with their edge-security model and automatic backups. This is why it's ranked among the best wallets for security &amp; privacy.
@_date: 2016-11-18 21:54:54

For real. Except bitcoin is less volatile now. I remember the $100+ price swings within an hour.
@_date: 2016-11-16 21:28:41


Gold is of coarse the go-to hedge asset, but we've also seen a flight to bitcoin under volatile market conditions in various regions across the world for different reasons. Just last week we saw a spike in BTC during the US elections while DOW futures tumbled on the news of a President Elect Trump. Whenever China institutes capital controls, bitcoin sees a spike in price. We've seen this happen time and time again in troubled economies such as Cypress, Greece, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela etc... There is a definite flight to bitcoin as a safe haven asset.
I think it's very interesting that Bitcoin seems to actually be establishing itself as "Digital Gold" in the mind-share of everyone who hears about it and uses it. The fact that it's far more liquid and easier to acquire than physical gold will continue to further this trend.

Sure. The concern of volatility is shared among many. I'm just pointing out that fact that when you say volatility, it's subjective. Whether or not you see bitcoin as volatile depends on your economic situation, your risk tolerance, and variety of other factors.
Even then, I would still argue bitcoin has been a better store of value than even gold. Granted, bitcoin only has 7 years of history where as gold has thousands of years... so I could be very mistaken. However, even given the very brief history of bitcoin's trading, it has consistently been the among the [worlds best performing asset]( especially compared to gold.
While the volatility of bitcoin is often sited as a negative, I'm not sure it holds water when you break down the overall data whether your using it as a P2P currency, store of value, and/or inflation hedge.

How is that the largest, most funded wallet provider doesn't have these basic problems sorted out so their wallets do not rely on them so heavily?
@_date: 2016-12-19 21:57:43
Recommend buying/selling through Airbitz/Glidera.
Or you could try WallofCoins.com
@_date: 2016-12-09 14:16:58
No, but you'd think with as much funding as they've gotten they'd be pushing the curve, not following it. Perhaps I was a bit hasty in my comment. At least they didn't pull a Circle move...

You shouldn't trust any exchanges. If you don't own your keys, you don't own that bitcoin. Highly recommend moving your coins to a private wallet.

Luckily, you're using Airbitz (good move). Airbitz automatically encrypts and then backs up your wallet private keys to their servers, so in the event your device gets lost/stolen/broke/fails you simply download the Airbitz app to your new device and login using your username and password and that's it. DO NOT FORGET THOSE and you're fine. Make sure you setup your recover questions just to be 100% sure.
Other wallets require you to write down and store a 12 word or 24 word seed (private key) which would be your backup to restore your wallet. I find Airbitz method to be much easier and just as secure.

They're like the Napster of Bitcoin wallets now.
They are one of the oldest and most well funded bitcoin companies, They have the largest usership of wallets, yet they're wallet is WAY behind other wallets (such as Airbitz, Breadwallet, Mycellium, Copay ect.) that are implementing better features and more security with a fraction of the resources.
They're increasingly unreliable as a wallet service and are doing a poor job staying on top of bitcoin innovation IMO.

Yeah, you want to store your coins in a way that it's backed up. A hardware device is more secure and can be backed up.
@_date: 2015-08-01 04:12:32
I'm sure they do keep logs. But since Shapeshift doesn't collect any info from the user, seems pretty safe as far as protecting identity. All they can do is track coins to and fro, which anyone can do on the blockchain(s) anyways. Just adds layers of complexity to trackers.

Yes, I get your point, obviously I'm not recommending people get bitcoin just so you can buy a gift card to use at restaurants.
This is clearly for people who already have bitcoin and are going to spend it, or maybe want to buy a gyft card for someone's bday and then send that to them. It is very easy to do this using bitcoin given you already have bitcoin. It's only 'moving backwards' if you're still using legacy systems.

Airbitz is a must have. The most underrated wallet out.
@_date: 2015-08-01 21:20:46
Correct, you can login to your wallet without being connected to the internet (provided you've already used that device to login to that wallet before).
@_date: 2015-08-01 15:10:07
Yes it would be. If you really did generate keys that are already in use, the noble thing would be to dispose of the keys.
How did you generate the keys? This could be a problem with the random number generation. Blockchain.info wallets had a weak r-value problem last year that a whitehat was able to take hundreds of coins from users wallets because he found the weak r-value and was able to generate wallet keys already in use. Luckily he gave them back.
Whatever method you used, I'd make sure the devs know this may be a problem.

There are wallets that are simple and secure to use where you are in complete control... such as Airbitz. Only requires a Username and Password of choice (just like you'd do on Coinbase anyway), except you control the keys. 
Airbitz wallet data is encrypted on the device and automatically backed up to the cloud so even if her device got lost, broken or stolen, you just download the app again and use the login credentials and your good to go. 
No manual backups. As easy as mobile banking. Give it a shot.

@_date: 2015-07-06 18:16:12
I use Airbitz because of the auto-backup feature. I can choose the Username/Password that gives me access to my funds. No need to even mess with 12 word seeds, makes it easy.
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:12:37
It's not so much that your funds are 'in' the passphrase, just the passphrase are access keys to the locker where those funds are held in the blockchain. Your wallet has those keys, but you should always make backups of those keys offline (the passphrase), to make sure you have spare keys should something happen to your device.
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:58:23
If you 'backup' your seed (12 word phrase in breadwallet), then that is your keys to your funds. Therefore regardless of what happens to the app, your device, or breadwallet itself, you can recover access to your funds another way.
If you didn't secure that seed though, you're keys can not be recovered.
@_date: 2015-08-03 00:35:47
I also have my mom on Airbitz. Username &amp; Password is much easier for her to understand and use rather than 12 word seed that you need to store yadda yadda...

[Airbitz]( kinda does this with their gift cards. It's a customized QR code private key only readable by Airbitz wallets. A nice looking paperwallet basically. But I hand them out all the time. Instructions to redeem are printed on the card so it's super easy.

@_date: 2015-07-15 16:01:05
Understood. That's why I would stay away from PC clients. Mobile devices are way more secure. Airbitz has built-in 2FA as well, so someone would not only have to know the log-in info but also have possession of the device.

SPV is great, till it's verifying on top of invalid mined blocks :/
Not being SPV (yet) doesn't make Airbitz insecure, just makes it dependent on full nodes, like everything else. Since Airbitz uses Libbitcoin nodes (same as DarkWallet and OpenBazaar), these nodes are distributed enough so it's fast, reliable and secure.
@_date: 2015-07-28 02:35:59
Personal ideologies have nothing to do with the effectiveness of fault tolerance systems. Decentralized infrastructure is, by it's nature, more resilient then centralized ones. As these systems grow bigger and get easier to use, the average person will recognize this and use these systems based on their interests. 
This is how we went from Napster to Bittorrent.
@_date: 2015-08-12 03:42:59
Depends on the wallet functionality. Wallets where the user has full control of keys/funds (such as Airbitz, Breadwallet, Mycelium) are not effected.
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:34:17

Airbitz is def a must have. Mycelium local trader is great too.
@_date: 2017-04-30 04:07:57
Most wallet apps don't have as many features as Airbitz, such as using your location for their directory or your contacts for sending payment requests via SMS or email.
Realize that Airbitz has built their whole Edge-Security platform around the premise of pushing high level security and privacy to the edges (meaning your device). Since Airbitz encrypts all app data first and foremost, it really doesn't matter what permissions you give the app because it only stays with the device. So definitely nothing like Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-02-03 20:42:08
"New HD Wallet"... in this space, this shouldn't be touted as an accomplishment at this point. All other major wallets have had HD for a while now. The fact it took BC.info so long is a shame.
@_date: 2016-02-08 05:18:46
Def backup of your wallet requires it.
Airbitz automatically backs up your wallet with their zero-knowledge, client side edge security so I just need to remember my username/password. As secure and private as Mycellium but dummy/lazy proof (which is what I need).
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:17:25
+1 for Airbitz!
@_date: 2016-02-16 14:06:54
Airbitz is a great choice for having privacy and security of your bitcoin. When buying from a regulated exchange, you run the risk of compromising your identity, no matter what wallet you use. Depending on how the internal processes work at Clevercoin, it's possible they use BitID to transfer and verify your data in a more secure way.
Buying from someone with cash is the best way. Wall of Coins, Localbitcoins, BitQuick, Mycellium local trader, are all cash-to-bitcoin options.
@_date: 2017-04-12 17:38:44
Airbitz uses BitID in combination with their Edge-Login for Glidera, Augur, Wings, and Lunyr.
I think it's inexcusable for crypto apps not to utilize this as a safe and secure way to login without giving up any personal info or remembering/logging yet another password/passphrase.
I'm starting to insist it be implemented on the various apps, exchanges, and platforms I use.
@_date: 2016-02-03 20:39:31
It's about time... but I switched to Airbitz a long time ago.
I actually find the fact that it took so long for the largest wallet provider with the most investment early on to implement HD wallets and up their security model, rather damaging. I think the relatively slow innovation in BC.info has actually done more harm to bitcoin adoption then good.
@_date: 2015-07-01 18:33:46
Hold you're own bitcoin. Move them to a private wallet like [Airbitz]( (iOS&amp;Android). Also, learn about paper wallets.
@_date: 2017-04-01 18:05:14
That is completely false.
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:44:57
That depends on the wallet though. That's true for BIP 39 wallets such as Breadwallet/Mycelium that require you to write down your seed and secure it. However, Airbitz lets you choose your Username/Password but your wallet is encrypted client-side and then auto-backed up to their distributed server network. This makes it instantly secure while being user-friendly. I don't need to do anything else to secure my wallet except remember my Username/Password.
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:14:43
I can't wait to buy/sell stuff on this platform!
@_date: 2016-02-09 20:17:23
Right. Airbitz uses S-Crypt password hashing &amp; AES256 encryption client-side by using random inputs along with your username/pwd. So you only need to memorize your username/pwd to decrypt the wallet on your device. Not to mention their One-touch 2FA built in app.
Just a more user friendly way of doing a backup while not compromising security.
@_date: 2015-07-10 13:58:07
Did the payment get confirmed in a normal timeframe?
@_date: 2017-04-01 17:25:22
If you want to minimize damage, you might consider not spreading FUD. Airbitz has not stated any such thing. They will start integrating SegWit when consensus reaches 80% but now they have to prepare for the possibility of a HF split, like every bitcoin company does.
@_date: 2017-04-05 02:37:57
Airbitz is my goto bitcoin directory.
@_date: 2017-04-28 19:48:46
I wasn't aware of this. That's very interesting.
So you mean to tell me that Satoshi didn't even follows Satoshi's "original vision"?
@_date: 2017-04-25 02:02:38
That's ultimately a matter of user preference. For myself, Airbitz offers the security/privacy features that suit my desires and needs. I believe the auto-encrypt/backup and sync provided by Airbitz is much more user friendly than the manual 12 word seed backups for new users. Airbitz offers more 3rd party services, buy/sell, giftcard purchases, bitcoin directory, adding meta data to transactions, exporting wallet transactions in csv format, etc...
@_date: 2015-07-31 12:00:28
Congrats! Be sure to list your business on the bitcoin directory [Airbitz](
@_date: 2017-04-25 04:06:36
I second this. Airbitz uses a more familiar scheme of username/password while maintaining it's decentralized nature of being private and secure. Try it out.

They have different levels of verification. They will ask for more info the more you use them. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 18:12:42
I'm aware of desktop wallets you can select nodes, I wasn't aware of any popular mobile wallets doing it.
Airbitz connects to Electrum to broadcast, so at worst it's as random as Electrum. Airbitz is designed to not require trusting them... as any real bitcoin wallet should be designed.
@_date: 2017-04-28 19:23:16
Bitcoin wallets is a tough gig... hard to keep them going strong without major investment, which seems to have stopped.
I'm really happy with Airbitz, they've kept steady.
@_date: 2016-02-20 03:17:51
The bitcoin space should be leading the charge of privacy and security because we're deadline with digital money. You'd think this mindset would be default in this space,  but we've seen time and time again where bitcoin companies lack the security protocols and get hacked. 
Good to see companies like Airbitz and others taking it seriously.
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:17:15
Simply install Airbitz on your wife's device and log-in as normal with your Username &amp; Password and you're good to go.
Erasing the app will not effect your funds. Only forgetting your Username &amp; Password will lose your access to your funds permanently.
If you had the 2FA enabled, try resyncing your phone's time/clock with an accurate clock as this could throw off the time sensitive code the device uses to authorize access.
@_date: 2016-02-29 02:26:30

Thanks for asking. I run all the meetups for the Tampa Bay area (200+ members). I teamed up with Bitpay and helped organize groups to onboard 100+ businesses in the area for the Bitcoin Bowl.

So... I do what I can.

Coinbase isn't a proper wallet though, they're a bank. You'd expect them to secure their bitcoins. But they can also lock you out of your account.

Totally agree about Airbitz. Even if you don't use it as your main wallet (which you should), their glidera integration, foldapp integration, bitrefill, and bitcoin directory are just a few other reasons why it's a great app for any bitcoiner.

For security purposes. When your private keys become valid on both chains, you want to be careful where you input your private keys if you're trying to claim your new coins on the new chain. For instance, if there is malicious software that logs private keys, then you're risking losing everything.

@_date: 2017-10-27 19:53:09
No problem.
Yes, at the time of the fork, whatever balance of Bitcoin you had, you will have the same on the forked chain. They essentially copy bitcoins blockchain to a certain point, so after the fork, the coins you held are now replicated in the new chain. As long as you hodl the private keys, you're coins are fine on both chains.
[Here is a step by step walkthrough on how to acquire your BCH from Airbitz.](
This will be the same process with Bitcoin Gold and 2x.
@_date: 2015-04-24 00:54:24
At this point, you've got your bits... now you need to be well versed in security.
Hopefully you're NOT holding your stash in a hosted wallet (Coinbase, Circle, any exchange), if so, I'd highly suggest moving them into a wallet where you are the only holder of the private keys. If you don't own your keys, you don't really own your bits.
First, hlod most of your bitcoins OFFLINE in a paper wallet. Generate keys offline and keep them offline. Store in a safe or the like. Transfer majority of funds to there.
For Desktop you can use Bitcoin Core client.
For a private mobile wallet such as Airbitz (highly recommended for both iOS &amp; Android), Breadwallet (iOS), or Mycellium (Android). These are meant for spending, so only keep what you need in these.
You're now your own bank. This comes with alot of responsibility but you also are in complete control of your money. Most people are not prepared and end up loosing their money by misplacing a password or the private keys. Take the time to learn about how these things work and test them out with small bits first until your comfortable. It's not difficult, just a learning process.
Welcome to the future. :)

With Airbitz you hold your private keys. So you're good there. 
Sometime before the fork, I would consolidate coins into 1 wallet before the fork happens (you can create separate wallets within Airbitz), extract the private key, store it somewhere safe. 
After the fork happens, then move your coins back to their original wallet(s) or new wallet(s) if you prefer (a new wallet with new private keys is probably best). Then use the private key you wrote down to access the new coins on the new chain in a new wallet that supports it.
Maybe some wallets will be equipped to support splitting your coins right away, likely not though, so this is how to do it manually. 
Airbitz will likely not take a stance because they don't really need to. Their wallet allows users to connect to whatever node they want, so if you want to follow a particular chain, tether your wallet to your own node or a node you trust.

I don't get this though... they ask what is Bitcoin "backed" by, and then proceed to say how the dollar has a lender of last resorts aka the FED. They never seem to ask what the FED backs their notes with.
I have to wonder if they fundamentally don't understand how the FED works? Or are they being willfully ignorant? Do they think the FED has Gold reserves to back all the QE? I know this is CNBC but come on!
@_date: 2015-09-09 20:26:56
It would be far cheaper. 
Assuming you had a verified Coinbase acct, you could buy bitcoins with your England bank acct (1% trading fee) and then sell into your US bank acct. (1% trading fee).

It's hard to believe how many of you are missing the fact that BITCOIN IS BEING ACCEPTED BY A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR THE FIRST TIME!  
This is an amazing achievement for bitcoin and sets a level of legitimacy to it and opens the door for conversation to merchants and friends to accept bitcoin as well.

Translated: we're going to remove all the features that make bitcoin so attractive and worth using.
@_date: 2015-09-02 14:08:16
It's not that simple. Lots of merchants don't want to hassle with this because it doesn't integrate easily with their POS system (which are more often then not older). They WANT a payment processor that handles integration for them and provides the tools to cash out in fiat. Not to mention Bitpay absorbs the risk of volatility and conversion.
Sure, in a 'perfect world', merchants would accept bitcoin as they would dollars because they can payout employees or their supply chain with it, but until then, we do need prepackaged solutions that processors like Bitpay provide that make it simple for merchants to accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 01:00:05
How did you generate the wallet address you sent the bitcoin to if your core wasn't sync'd? Did you use something else to generate the wallet?
@_date: 2015-09-15 15:30:44
Yeah it's legit. You can purchase as little as $5 to try it out.

Paper wallet is good for storage.
But if you want your mom to see the value in Bitcoin and experience how easy it is to use, I'd suggest Airbitz. 
Built-in directory, user friendly, highly secure, auto-backups (no 12 word seed explanation/confusion), One touch 2FA built-in. Just very similar to mobile banking so it doesn't feel like a foreign concept to new comers.

The 'best' wallet in terms of security is a paper wallet.
The 'best' wallet in terms of security, privacy, ease of use, functionality, and features is [Airbitz]( (for both iOS &amp; Android). Encrypts everything client-side then auto-backs up your wallet and syncs cross platform and device, lots of great features I haven't seen in any other wallet.
For iOS, Breadwallet is solid too, just very basic, lacks features imo.
For Android, Mycellium is also good, the local trader is handy if you're into trading locally.
@_date: 2015-09-01 03:33:27
+1 for Airbitz. Loaded with features, stellar in privacy/security. 
Def own your keys 100% no matter what.
@_date: 2015-09-08 20:50:49
At least you know the security measure works extremely well! 
Seriously though, sorry to hear that, I'm sure that's frustrating. As a side note, Airbitz also works on an iPod touch or Android tablet devices where you can enable them with the 2FA for backup.
@_date: 2015-09-05 00:57:57
The private key isn't ever registered on the blockchain, (hence private), it's the cryptographic signature to the public key, which is the address your bitcoins should have been sent to. I haven't looked on core in a long time, but you should be able to access the privkey to the address you sent. It should be a menu option. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 01:14:19
It doesn't have anything to do with the userbase, it has to do with the architecture of BCI. They're wallets are reliant on their centralized servers. And they're constantly having problems. I got sick of it personally.

I understand that, but this isn't just general financial news, this pertains specifically to people making payments through their mobile device, which does effect bitcoin considering the changing norms of behavior of the average person using their phone as a wallet. How is this off-topic from bitcoin?
As I recall, Apple-Pay announcement was pretty big news in regards to how it effects bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-10 17:40:09
Undoubtedly, but that's because of the massive enterprises behind this and familiar branding.
I'm more inclined to consider how this moves the ball forward in terms of people becoming normalized to using their phone as a wallet. This is exactly the behavior shift we need to see on a mass scale to make bitcoin seem less intimidating to both consumers and merchants.

There are only a few wallets I'd consider "awesome": Airbitz, Mycellium, breadwallet, and maybe Copay (for multisig).
[Airbitz]( is my personal favorite. Auto-encrypt, auto-backup, 2FA built-in, cross-platform sync, accurate merchant directory, 100% autonomy = piece of mind for my bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-04 03:23:13

Just HODL.
Althought a great wallet, Airbitz isn't a cold wallet, however you do own your private keys. So you're good there. I would consolidate coins into 1 wallet before the fork happens, make sure you have the private key written down, wait till the fork happens, then move your coins back to their original place or a new place if you prefer (a new wallet with new private keys is probably best). Then use the private key you wrote down to access the new coins on the new chain in a new wallet.
Maybe some wallets will be equipped to support splitting your coins, likely not though, so you'll have to do it manually.

Airbitz is integrating Glidera, it's now in private beta. Launching this fall.
@_date: 2015-09-04 03:34:54
Bitcoin Core runs as a full node, this is why you're getting hit with downloading the entire blockchain.
Are you 'sure' you sent it to your core wallet address? 
If so, you should be able to access your private key even without downloading the full blockchain. This is what you need to spend those coins. Once you get the private key, you'll want to import it into another wallet that's easier to manage.
The most userfriendly way to deal with bitcoins is with a mobile wallet. I recommend [Airbitz]( for iOS &amp; Android. Simply pick a Username &amp; Password and you're good to go. Feels like mobile banking, but all your wallet data is heavily encrypted on your device and then backed up automatically so you can never loose access to your wallet even if something happens to your mobile.
@_date: 2015-04-16 17:41:42

@_date: 2016-10-31 01:20:16
Airbitz is total crap because you forgot your username/password and then didn't like going through the recovery process? That makes no sense.
It's more difficult to log into Coinbase (username, password, 2FA SMS, then sometimes a secondary email to confirm a 'new device') and even after all that, you don't control the private keys.
If you can use Coinbase, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to use Airbitz.
@_date: 2016-10-06 01:30:27
The point is this OneCoin is not an alt, it's not a cryptocurrency at all. Yet they're marketing themselves as such. Meaning when the SHTF with OneCoin, it's going to reflect badly on ALL cryptocurrencies from a PR standpoint, further damaging the already bad reputation bitcoin has in the public eye.

Obviously if you're trying to buy enough bitcoin while making a purchase, you're right, it's not feasible or practical. You're doing 2 transactions instead of 1. But why would anyone do that? If you're just going to make 1 purchase, it makes sense to just use fiat. You don't exchange $49.95 for bitcoin to spend $49.95 worth of bitcoin 10mins later on your bitpay account that will convert it back to dollars into your bank acct. That misses the point and the benefits of bitcoin.
If you're a merchant that accepts bitcoin then you're appealing to bitcoin users, people who already have bitcoin they want to spend or they'll buy enough to cover any costs of transacting with it.
It would also do you well to offer a small discount to bitcoin spenders and direct customers on how to acquire bitcoins before they come to your establishment or website.

I think this is a great idea. Keeping the oracles inline would be the biggest challenge, but sounds pretty do-able.
I'd eventually like to see multi-sig with at least 2 keys being maintained by users themselves, one within the wallet and one with a 'cold' device, such as a chip-card so you can sign you're own multi-sig transactions with the hot wallet and cold chip-card.

@_date: 2015-03-18 21:54:49
Airbitz is the way to go. Very easy with high security that feels familiar. No need to mess with writing down 12 word phrases.
For your PC, I'd say Hive or Electrum. Although, I think a PC is more susceptible to security vulnerabilities. Keeping it on a mobile device with 2FA is easier and safer. Airbitz automatically encrypts your data and backs it up for you so you set it and forget it. Except your password, don't forget that. hah
@_date: 2016-10-05 20:50:43
I with you the crypto-community should call out scams like OneCoin, because they will bring a bad name and completely unnecessary (read damaging) regulation to bitcoin and/or real cryptocurrencies.
They're robbing the language of blockchain technology to sell nothing but promises of profit. This isn't about whether or not to include regulators, it's about the PR nightmare Bitcoin/Blockchain is going to have on the general public when OneCoin implodes. This is something we do not need.
We should be out front about this as a unified community to distinguish OneCoin as something completely disconnected from the technology we're promoting, utilizing, &amp; building upon. We do not want to be associated with MLM schemes.

Yes, Airbitz is a bitcoin directory/wallet all-in-one. They were the offical wallet of the Bitcoin Bowl so they worked with Bitpay to list merchants.
Swiss army knife of bitcoin apps. And yes, the directory is both Web and app. The wallet is just for mobile though.

That's all it takes to get rid of the 2-party duopoly. Once a party gets 5% of the votes in an election they achieve a "major party" status and will then receive a portion of federal campaign funds, free ballot access in all 50 states, and be included in major polls and debates. It would be a game changer, and it's totally possible.
The Libertarian Nominee **will** be the only other candidate on the ballot in all 50 states in November (the Green party doesn't have that).
The LP also accepts bitcoin donations ;)

I don't think that is necessarily true. There are wallets that provide a high level of security and privacy, such as Airbitz, Breadwallet, and Mycelium. Bitcoin core is impractical for most people just now getting into bitcoin. Who wants to run a full node just to have a wallet? I think it's harder to secure a computer from hacking then a mobile device.
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:55:26

Good content on the site. Thanks for the resource. However, one correction is that user doesn't own the private keys with Coinkite. Only they have full access to them.
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:15:46
Luke, I respect and admire your work, but this is probably one of the worst ideas you've ever had. If BIP148 fails, then just face the fact we failed to reach a substantial consensus. We can't just split the coin everytime factions fail to reach consensus, we'll just be cannibalizing ourselves which looses sight of what this is all about, which is freedom and autonomy from central banks.
It'd be better to just move to Litecoin at that point rather than trying to launch a franken-BTC-alt, there has to be a point where you just stop for the sake of the whole crypto economy.
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:32:51
Of coarse if that's what your comfortable with and it suites your needs, then that's fine. I'm just saying for new users, BC.info is not the most user friendly wallet out there. After trying out the other wallets I struggle to find any reason to ever use my BC.info wallet ever again or recommend them to others.
Just FYI, both Airbitz and Breadwallet are on iOS.  Airbitz can actually automatically sync your wallet across platforms (Android and iOS). So I can manage my same wallet(s) whether I'm using my iPhone or my Samsung tablet.
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:29:44
Have you tried the other wallets? The other wallets I mentioned are actually more decentralized and secure then BC.info, plus have more features and convenience. That is my point. These other wallets are blowing BC.info away in innovative ways without millions of dollars in investments.
@_date: 2015-10-28 13:48:04
You should be able to export the privKey into Electrum although it's not recommended. PC's are more susceptible to hacking/virus attacks that could compromise your bitcoin wallets. Mobile devices are more secure.
@_date: 2015-03-04 14:37:53
I beg to differ, BC.info is not the easiest way to get someone into bitcoin. There are more user-friendly wallets now. That was my entire point. 
Nobody was talking about a counter revolution, so not sure where that came from. I simply want people to use bitcoin and that starts with having a wallet that is easy to use, protects your identity and secures your funds with easy backups/recovery.
These other wallets are just as easy as BC.info (if not easier) to get started on. And they are all safer to secure.
Airbitz is probably the easiest to secure, because it automatically backs-up an encrypted version of your wallet. And it doesn't require you to answer the 7 questions, it's optional for password recovery purposes. Takes just a minute to download and get these wallets ready to use.
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:33:39
Then so be it, maybe Bitcoin wasn't what we thought. Maybe we failed it. Maybe we need to implement better upgrading mechanisms. Maybe achieving consensus on a distributed system isn't really possible at this scale. Maybe we need to go back to the drawing board. Or maybe the sky won't fall, the honey badger will do it's thing and will come out better in the end? We don't know how any of this is going to play out, but this whole notion that we can split off a chunk of the network &amp; change PoW to have a premined alt-BTC leads to a bad place too. If you want that, then just use ETH.
@_date: 2016-05-11 20:53:47


The OP has a right to be concerned, because not all wallets are created equal. It is incumbent on the user to do their due diligence and pick the wallet that has demonstrated to be private and secure.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:54:30
Call it what you want. Semantics to me.

BIP91 is very similar to BIP141 but is triggered with 80% hashpower instead of having 95% by a set activation date. It's compatible with BIP148 (by signaling SegWit activation with bit1) and also SegWit2x. 
Since BIP91 has no set activation time, BIP148 played it's part by setting a deadline for activation forcing the miners hands to act. Seems to be working.

@_date: 2015-03-19 14:04:49
To the point of the encryption, that's technically true for all encrypted wallets, as seen with Blockchain.info wallets having weak r-values. But Airbitz uses AES256 encryption.
That information is misleading on how Airbitz functions though. According to their white paper, Airbitz does use their own servers to backup and sync users encrypted wallets, but that doesn't have anything to do with pushing transactions to the Bitcoin network.

In the case of a split chain, all of the BTC released to this point has the same effect as a pre-mine. The only difference is it's not a new coin, it's a bastard-child chain with the same genesis.

That is very unfortunate. She should use [Airbitz]( from now on.  Automatically encrypts and backs up your wallet with a strong passphrase. Whether you delete the app or loose your phone, you can just install the app on another device (either iOS or Android) and access your funds.
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:14:37

@_date: 2017-05-25 19:57:53
These are all good wallets that are private and secure. I personally feel the most comfortable with Airbitz and love all the features in the app including changing tx fee.
That said, this is usually a matter of preference by the user, so try them all and see which one you like best.
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:07:10
If you don't want to remember or backup 12 random words, you could use [Airbitz]( which uses a single strong passphrase you generate.  Gives you a little more flexibility to access your wallet on any iOS and/or Android device just with your passphrase. It's always automatically encrypted and backed up for you.
Experiment with a few bits to see whats more comfortable for you.

For me, I like that my Airbitz wallet is accessible on both my Android and iOS devices.  I use Mycelium for the local trader but Airbitz for general use and securing my funds because it's much much easier then dealing with storing 12-words and restore backup tools.  Airbitz is automatic, they encrypt client-side and back-up your wallet automatically.

Airbitz provides a password recovery. You have to set it up within the app though.
@_date: 2015-03-18 02:49:36
It's important to understand when you use online exchanges like Coinbase and Circle, they are holding your bitcoins for you like a bank holds your money for you.
If you want to hold your own funds without any 3rd party, you need to use a non-hosted wallet, such as [Airbitz]( (available on both iOS and Android). That way only you hold your keys, and only you control your funds.
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:14:03
My favorite wallet by far. They prioritize privacy and security using their edge-security model but easy to use for the average person. With a Username/Pwd, you have complete control of your private keys. Love the auto-encrypt/backup/sync feature so I don't have to worry about loosing my funds. 
They've got a ton of other features too, like built-in 2FA, built-in bitcoin directory, discounted giftcards for Target &amp; Starbucks, buy/sell directly with Glidera, add private metadata to transaction details, export tx list to spreadsheet format... Just a must have app for any bitcoiner regardless of what wallet use.
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:59:49
All of these wallets give you control of your private keys.
I primarily use Airbitz &amp; Jaxx.
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:59:18
This is a reminder that needs to be pinned at the top. When I buy from Coinbase I transfer directly to my [Airbitz]( wallet.  It's not that I think Coinbase is going to go bankrupt or disappear like Mt.Gox... but simply for the fact that I want to be assured that I'm the only one with the keys to my coins.
@_date: 2016-07-07 13:27:00
Well done!
@_date: 2016-07-15 14:14:58
You're confusing integrated features for ads somehow.
@_date: 2016-07-19 23:40:54
Yes, you have to launch those services, meaning you have to specifically click on it. The discounted giftcards (Target &amp; Starbucks) do not popup nor do they take you outside the app. You order &amp; use the giftcards from directly inside the wallet, there is no browser involved at any point whatsoever. That is not an ad, that IS the service.
Unfortunately, Purse.io is different because they don't have an API to support a direct integration for now. So yeah, you have to use Purse.io through their site. If you don't want to use Purse.io, you don't have to, but it's there incase you do. But it's no different than a hyperlink. 
A popup ad would literally popup without you doing anything. This is never the case in Airbitz.
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:54:42
Mycelium is good. I've been using [Airbitz]( lately though and love it, for both my android and iOS devices.

Airbitz is the most secure android wallet according to the Open Bitcoin Privacy Report.

This is the whole concept behind their edge-security platform.

Give [Airbitz]( a try. You can't be locked out and it's very secure.
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:11:22
After sampling all the wallets out there, Airbitz has become my main wallet now. Blockchain became too glichy and unreliable for me. I like how Airbitz has the high level of security by using HD automatically, and also encrypting everything client-side then they back up my encrypted wallet automatically to their server network.  That way I have complete autonomy and can also access my wallet from multiple devices, and I can use my funds regardless of whether their servers are down. And they're directory is the best by far, accurate and up to date.
Airbitz is simply the best wallet there is.

@_date: 2017-06-28 15:59:35
You don't need to trust Airbitz because they connect to Electrum nodes for broadcasting/validation, you can even specify a node to connect to, for instance, if you're running your own full node and want to use that. You have the ability to use Airbitz with your own fully validating node if you choose to.
For the average user, they just want something that works, is secure, gives you full control of your private keys which Airbitz provides.

I've had my funds stolen out from my mycelium wallet before.  Couple hundred dollars worth.  Not a fortune but still really sucked. Still unsure how it happened. The only thing I could think was a similar flaw blkchn.info had in the r-value when generating keys? This was an older version so I'm sure any issue like that would have been fixed by now.
No one from mycelium could give me any answers, and I'm not a n00b.  After that incident, I mainly use Airbitz now.
I would suggest diversifying your coins between paper wallets and a couple different mobile wallets.
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:32:13

@_date: 2017-06-28 16:03:45
If you have the private seed in a safe, then you're probably good as that is essentially cold storage.
Airbitz has a very robust security model, I'm very comfortable hodling a 'decent' size in it. I recommend enabling the 2FA built into the wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:08:01
If you use Glidera from within Airbitz, they send bitcoin directly to your Airbitz wallet and they have pretty competitive fees compared to Coinbase.
You make a very important point though, in general all these fees add up just for using bitcoin. Doesn't cause a problem for long-term HODLers, but bitcoin should be faster, easier &amp; cheaper to use than anything else (as it use to be).

The point is *if* segwit2x happens, it'll only happen with consensus. Same with SegWit, BU, 8mb, BIP148, BIP149, Ext Blocks etc...
Nobody can 'take over' bitcoin, bitcoin will remain as is until consensus on a different option is achieved, that's the bottom line.

Def try [Airbitz]( Ranked among the top mobile wallets for privacy, security, ease of use per the OBPP. Has built in bitcoin directory to find the nearest place to spend your BTC, also has Fold.app integrated in so you can get discounted Starbucks or Target giftcards very quickly. Tons of other features. Must have for any bitcoiner.

If Bitcoin remains around it's current dominance level, that works out to be over $100k per coin... personally, I think that's low balling a 5-year projection.

WTF is an "improperly forked coin"?
If it's open-source, it can be forked... there is nothing improper about it.

Airbitz is one that let's you select fees based on priority low fee, standard fee, high fee where the basis of the standard fee is dynamically figured based on network conditions.
Using the standard fees, I haven't had any issues getting transactions confirmed in a reasonable time, even during high usage.

Pretty much any wallet is better than BC.info... but I'm a big Airbitz fan. They hide the complexity of securing your wallet by automatically encrypting your wallet data on your device and then backing it up for you. The Username, password is used to decrypt your wallet while not exposing your private keys. It's suppose to 'feel' like mobile banking, but it's a private and secure bitcoin wallet.
Really though it's user preference, I'd try out several wallets to see what works best for your needs. 
No matter what, control your private keys.

Dude, BIP38 is your friend! Encrypt the private key THEN engrave it.
