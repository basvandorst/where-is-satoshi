100,000,000,000 supply, I think you're correct.

It's missing the ubiquitous moon references. That never gets tedious to read in every post.

Too close to home for laughter. I'll offer a beer though.

Since most people's thoughts are only Facebook memes, the payment has to be split 200 ways with the hive mind.

I believe that there is a place for this type of discussion and the communal expression of excitement, regret, and loss, but I also wish for a more in depth forum as well. I am attempting to get a new sub started that will focus on the more philosophical and technical aspects of crytocurrency and blockchain. I would be happy for you to share there and hopefully we can get something going (It is only a week old and I haven't started posting yet, but I am working on some articles now and I have a backlog to post this weekend.) @_date: 2017-09-14 12:02:15
You also need to consider his audience. People who are buying and selling Bitcoin are not listening to this guy. The average citizen is not listening to this guy. The only ones listening are the ones who are interested in standard investment and investment banking. Those are the only people he is interested in speaking to. He doesn't care what anyone here thinks, and he isn't trying to influence the cryptocurrency community.
If you look at the two main sound bites, his message is to his traders and his investors. He is telling any of his investors who might be interested in Bitcoin because of its massive returns that it is a scam. He is telling his traders not to even think about entertaining these conversations with their clients or they will get fired. This is simply to ease any pressure that Chase might be getting to improve their returns.

Their deposit fee is only $5 more than Kraken and they process in a day. Kraken has held my last deposit for 4 with no end in sight and won't tell me when I can have access to my money.

Have some compassion. Bitcoin stole his daughter.

Kraken charges a flat $5 fee to deposit fiat via wire transfer, which will be in addition to whatever your bank charges. Domestic withdrawal of USD is free, and the SWIFT fee is $60 for withdrawal via wire transfer. The trade fee for BTC will most likely be between .16 and .26 for you. The Coinbase wire fee is 10.00 and the trade fee is 1.49. You seem to be quoting fees for credit card purchases. If this is the method you want to use, Coinbase will be your only option between the two as Kraken does not support credit card funding. Depending on were you live, Cex.io might be an option for you.

It doesn't get much better after you're approved. They have had my last USD deposit on hold for 4 days and won't even reply to my emails. It is just sitting there in my deposit screen with a blue hold on it. It cleared my bank last Thursday. This is the second time this has happened with them.

This particular issue could still affect you if you are planning to deposit fiat (USD) to fund your purchases. I have never had a problem moving coins into the market to make purchases of other coins, but I continue to have problems moving fiat into the market. Your other plan to keep your coins in a wallet is absolutely correct. You should never keep coins stored in a market, Kraken or Coinbase or anywhere else. You should only have coins in the market accounts long enough to make your trades or purchases, afterwards you should immediately transfer to your wallet. I hope this answers your question.

I like the guy with the shit eating grin next to him. I say they're both unemployed. Too good.
