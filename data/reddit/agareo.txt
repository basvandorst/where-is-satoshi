So much for the divisibility 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:13:52
Absolutely nothing has changed since bitcoin was 100
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:43:44
Yes. Think of the great bitcoin Oscar-winning biopics once it inevitably zeroes out

MMT isn't supported by any fed governor or mainstream economist

Someone might have two wallets each with more than a btc

So what if they failed? - the average person with all their savings would have lost them all. It would have hurt rich people a bit, it would have hurt the middle and working class a lot.

Positivity is all well and good but random platitudes are meaningless
@_date: 2019-03-17 20:31:51
You don't realise how much cash Buffet was sitting on lol
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:46:46
And you think bitcoin has found that balance?
@_date: 2019-03-01 14:13:51
Why does everyone in this sub compare total debt with GDP? Debt is an accumulation of yearly deficits and GDPs is a yearly measure. It'd be more accurate to compare the world wealth which is in the hundreds of trillions

It's identical to the 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin crowd

Credit card companies paying people to shill basic conclusions is the only unsubstantiated rumour here
@_date: 2019-03-09 09:39:26
Do you unironically believe this?
@_date: 2019-03-27 08:05:22
No it makes the market cap worthless
@_date: 2019-03-14 11:12:44
That's why most stable economies have central banks that are independent to the government so the government can't print money for political reasons. But this sub rallies against them as well
@_date: 2019-03-13 16:47:17
If it was would that be a bad thing?
@_date: 2019-03-15 18:33:24
An economy naturally depreciates because of productivity increase.
@_date: 2019-03-31 09:54:55
That's because productivity increase is deflationary

A user generates a pair of keys that are mathematically linked to each other. One key (the public key) is used for encryption and the other (the private key) is used for decryption. The algorithm is designed in such a way that it is infeasible for an attacker to derive the private key from a given public key
@_date: 2018-06-16 08:28:43
Yes that's definitely how millions is used in parlance. No need for "tens of" or "hundreds of" by the AG.
@_date: 2019-10-17 20:08:00
Productivity, which causes economic growth, isn't about consuming more resources but about increases in efficiency - producing more with less. This is inherently deflationary which is why money supply can increase by 5% every year but inflation is only 2%.
There's no apocalyptic collapse on schedule.
@_date: 2018-06-16 07:38:57
No, they only made several million. Small enough for the official press release from the lead A.G. to describe their profit as "millions," not tens or hundreds of millions.


They were charged 95 million dollars for activities that netted them less than ten.
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:05:35
You do realise quantitative easing is eventually unwound and that's why there's been no inflationary pressure from it?
@_date: 2019-08-19 11:46:55
Increasing aggregate demand, yes, of which consumption is only one part.
@_date: 2019-06-10 03:50:48
you're literally describing FOMO word for word which is an investment fallacy
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:10:25
According to your research you should still now
@_date: 2019-02-24 10:05:30
That sounds like nonsense

a normal noncriminal doesn't have the concern that their money will be seized

The biggest criticism of QE is that the Fed were too cautious and it ended up doing nothing. Fed should've stopped paying interest on reserves

Why do you still teach then?
@_date: 2019-04-02 08:05:25
Companies do. Shares are partial ownership of companies
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:24:57
There's a difference between inflation and hyperinflation 
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:25:14
No currency with an independent central bank has ever hyperinflated
@_date: 2019-04-19 10:15:36
Lol what? In a deflationary currency the rich get richer more and more by doing literally nothing
@_date: 2019-04-17 10:27:24
Yes it was a terrifyingly weak nation in 1923 right after ww1
@_date: 2019-04-02 10:20:34
You disagree with that assessment? If you own shares in a company you own a % of their factories, capital, etc. all tangible things
@_date: 2019-04-02 07:35:18
Crypto doesn't have any cash flows or intrinsic value like companies do
@_date: 2019-04-17 12:14:07
France literally invaded in '23 during the Ruhr crisis and they got trampled over this was when the hyperinflation occurred.
@_date: 2019-04-19 10:14:16
America got euros you dumb idiots. It was a currency swap
Then the European central bank lent out the dollars (to whom? it doesn't matter for the Fed)
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:47:01
Thanks buddy
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:36:15
The Fed are talking about billion dollar investments when they refer to increased spending. Not someone buying junk a store
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:09:20
I didn't say it'd make it valuable. It's good for the economy. The goal of the Fed isn't to make the US dollar more valuable - they want a steady rate of inflation. 
@_date: 2019-04-19 14:14:17
Yes but if Bitcoin is getting more valuable by X% every year (by virtue of being deflationary) and you're very rich you can spend up to X% and have your principal at worst stay the same
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:58:00
They could be trading the money themselves
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:36:47
Your answer makes no sense. It's only superior money after its met the usage requirements that define sound money. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:20:23
How is it superior money if it isn't being used?
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:11:43
The US Dollar is backed by the state which is backed by the military
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:41:37
so debit card withdrawal doesnt work in the uk?
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:34:10
The US dollar is backed by the strongest military on the planet and the fact that every single citizen's tax obligations MUST be paid using it giving it further value. Fiat and bitcoin aren't the "same".
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:48:11
how long does that take
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:01:40
You're clearly no economist.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:41:09
No one HODLs their dollars you absolute cretin. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:42:12
Intentional obfuscation.
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:09:20
Why can't it stabilise at 10K forever?
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:09:28
No country with an independent central bank has hyperinflated
@_date: 2018-12-05 09:55:29
And those that did either sold or rebought at a higher price
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:35:07
They own like 4-5% of US T-Bills and if they were to dump it they'll just be losing money themselves. The government debt has already been purchased
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:51:54
The same guy that caused the 4k to 5k pump just sold out. Dread to imagine how much he profited
@_date: 2018-12-10 10:06:52
Point me to the inflation figures. Not anecdotes
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:10:58
Fake tbh
@_date: 2018-12-17 15:08:24
I've heard it here thousands of times
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:33:06
Hence why Buffet doesn't think highly of gold
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:26:49
are you just gonna be weird and not elaborate?
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:21:11
What secret privileged cabal in the US is imploding?
And London prices have fallen 2% due to Brexit. Hardly free-fall after years of +10%
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:43:43
He's right though. Gold is useless as an investment. The markets beat it by factors of hundred in the long run
@_date: 2018-12-17 11:22:56
Because dividend is priced in. They're smart.
@_date: 2018-12-09 10:40:54
Good as a store of value. Not as an investment. Hedge funds might use gold to mitigate risk but that's not the same way a Ron Paul libertarian goldbug uses it
