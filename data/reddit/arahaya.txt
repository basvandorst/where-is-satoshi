cannot explain the details but the current version of Bitcoin Core uses an algorithm called "branch and bound" for coin selection.  
@_date: 2018-09-25 02:36:55
but the reason we need to upgrade in the first place is because we trusted the devs and not verify the code.

Even if Bitcoin becomes a global currency, I don't think average people will use (actual) Bitcoin.  
people will open accounts with banks and use payment providers to pass around fake Bitcoins, just like we do today with fiat. banks will have open channels with other banks to fulfill the payments. every day or week the banks will close the channels to settle the transactions.
@_date: 2018-08-24 02:00:04
all transactions will be backed by Bitcoin so nobody can print more money, which I believe is the purpose of Bitcoin. If you need censorship resistant transactions for some reason you could always own your Bitcoin and do onchain transactions.

If you think you witnessed or are involved in a crime, you simply report the evidence that you have (in this case the email) and the DOJ will decide what to do with it. even if they can't identify the owner from the email, the owner could be involved in other criminal cases and the information might help.

they may be higher than other exchanges but that doesn't mean they are overcharging onchain transaction fees. they just have high "binance withdrawal system usage fees".

@_date: 2019-10-23 13:33:30
would this flow solve the problem?
1. when you run a close command your node asks your peer what his last state is.
2. if the state is different than your local state, you could then 
    A) request your peer to close the channel.  
    B) force close with your local state.
in the above case can your peer prove to you that his state is the valid one? or at least it is newer?
@_date: 2019-02-13 06:11:11
if cenrtralized banks and private companies can solve the problem then I think that is fine.

the concept is to claim your bitcoin keys. in your case it would be to move your coins from Bitfinex to your bread wallet. (not sure if Coinbase wallet gives you your keys and never heard of Litewallet)
make sure you have your bread wallet backup phrase before you send your coins. wipe your wallet and check if you can restore it. then send a small amount and check if you can receive it.
BTW you don't have to do it on Jan 3. the date is just a reminder. do it whenever your comfortable but try not to procrastinate and prove you own your bitcoin.

I think it is more important that "anybody can run a node" than how many users run a node. so even if increasing the block size could result in more nodes I still don't think it is a good idea.

I understand we are prepending `0x0014` to the `keyhash` as the `scriptSig` but what is this magic number `0x0014` and why is it described as `&lt;0 &lt;keyhash&gt;&gt;` in the documents?

I think you guys have different definitions of "Better Bitcoin".  
if the new coin is a Bitcoin clone (I consider every alt coin that currently exists somewhat a Bitcoin clone) it will not replace Bitcoin.  
however, if the new coin is a completely different technological breakthrough and solves the byzantine generals problem (whereas PoW is just a work around) and scales like crazy, then it could replace Bitcoin. I don't think it will happen but none of us thought that Bitcoin will happen in 2008 either.
@_date: 2018-11-04 13:33:33
you could delay sending out the mined block (lets say block=100) and start mining a new block (block=101) on top of it, but there is a risk that another miner will also find a block (block='100) and propagate it through the network first.  
In that case unless you mine block 101 before the entire network finds block '101, then your block 100 and 101 will become worthless.  
Even if you have 50% of the hashrate you will be risking a 50% chance of losing the reward over a slight advantage of mining the next block.  
It might be an interesting study to see whether there is a divergence between the ratio of the pool's hash rate to the actually found number of blocks.
