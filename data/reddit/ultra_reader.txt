What matter is XRP tech no their token! I don't see it beyond $10 at the most!
IOTA, well it's something out of this world. And I state this from the tech point of view not price! 
Anyway good luck with xrp m8 ;)

Plot Twist: Her mom actually fucked Satoshi while being youngsters, then he taught her daughter everything he knew about decentralized money cripto idea and finally she stole her dad's idea and invented Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:35:45
Do yourself a favor and buy IOTA! ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:39:08
Come on man, you know I did it! 
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:14:14
Argentine here but I get it. Most of the US people wont give a shit cause they don't even know where Africa is hahahaha! Good one! 
@_date: 2018-10-18 13:01:01
Thx. Now I won't trade with 'em! 
@_date: 2018-10-20 13:16:49
Yeah but.... in the Pentagon also work nerds, so.... :)
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:32:22
yeah! 
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:51:49
Loved it! But how do you actually make it show btc price? Tutorial doesn't seem to show any price set up!!
Do you know if I can get it in the US? thx m8!!!
@_date: 2019-11-07 20:44:57
... and here is where IOTA enters!!
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:29:39
Is it possible to get another site's rate? Or just displays cryptofolio's? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:54:14
How come bch price keeps rising? o.O
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:50:43
Probably due to a lot of congestion, now it's working fine again!
thx Sage! 
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:42:57
Every 30m could translate in huge losses! Cant you set it up to refresh faster? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:18:09
Argentine = 18 Argentine pesos = 1 U$D dollar.
1 BTC = 3400 U$D
I've own almost 2BTC, don't come and tell me how hard it's to HODL!!!! 
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:30:53
Will it really happen? I'm waiting since yesterday!!! 
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:55:40
hahaha!!! None of mine either!!! 
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:11:56
So... Why would they need btc anymore? They live in fucking space!!!! 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:59:46
But it's in swedish... so...?
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:40:15
Did you do it through BUY BTC or SELL BCC option? thx!
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:36:34
Can someone confirm please if ViaBTC buys BCH with BUY BTC option under BCC/BTC option? I own 0.7 bch (with already 1 confirmation) but whenever I click on Sell BCC says "not enough balance". In the other hand if I go to Buy BTC I could possible buy if I wanted to.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:56:10
How could you sell if no exchange is trading bch yet?
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:06:07
200 x ~4100 =  U$D 820.000 x 18 (argentine peso) = 14,760,000 pesos. If I were you I'd either buy every btc I could or I'd sell every alt you own and live like a fu****g millionaire in Buenos Aires. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:22:00
When did it happen? Price went down? 
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:36:57
Do I need to wait for the 20 BCH deposit confirmations to withdraw my Btc? Or do I need to send'em the photos requested?
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:31:13
Proud to be a BITCOINER!
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:03:45
and thus began...
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:17:45
I only see:
BCC/BTC Trade
Buy BCC
Sell BCC
I suppose they've mistaken Buy BTC for Buy BCC. I bought "BCC" and returned me BTC. Now I'm struggling to get'em outta there.
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:47:56
Damn! that probably hurt! 
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:01:35
I finally took'em out! Some photos I had to upload that now I realice I shouldn't have done. Thx disruptioncoin!!!
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:19:17
I still can't get in! Damn btc is dropping! 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:30:25

@_date: 2017-11-26 13:58:20
Are we gonna see a correction any time soon?
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:54:36

@_date: 2018-03-13 12:40:07
Damn, poor guy!!!! 
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:30:07
ohh wait no! That applies for mexican people too!
No offense but saying american sounds outta place. I know you are taught like that since childhood, like "World Series" when you only play local baseball hahah!!!
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:09:10
yeah you tend to use the word Americans also as if you were the only inhabitants of the Americas! ;)
@_date: 2019-01-22 01:21:59
outside US known as football m8! 
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:17:54
us citizens? hahah!
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:08:11
Haha future is IOTA m8! Whenever btc partners with someone like Boch let's talk! 
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:09:05
no! dags are the future! 
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:12:14
What you say about dollars at poloniex? Is it safe to let them be (if btc price doesn't drop) until&amp;after 01/08?
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:41:35
How much you estimate? 
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:00:31
So what about the price? Isn't dropping anymore before 01/08? 
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:45:55
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:09:03
$2865 :)
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:46:39
I like asking baby boys about prices ;)
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:38:36
Here comes the drop... seeeeellllll!!!!!
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:05:35
I sold at 2545 :(
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:50:47
But... If I sell right now and then buy when it's near 1500 or less Wouldn't it be more profitable? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:42:17
Just moved everything to paper wallet, after August 1st I'll move every btc to electrum, then to electron cash!!!
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:38:56
Here comes the drop... seeeeellllll!!!!!
