That is pretty sure a fact (no way to prove two addresses belong to the same person without having the wallet). But: chain analytics can and probably still "assume" that as long as the amount is moving (or merging in the future) together it belongs to the same entity. IMHO such shallow logic will be "good enough" for the average A.G. or judge or jury too.

In a way they do though, just not with "guns". If -let's say- ten of us wanna split away no one will follow us, so we will end up with our own shitcoin no one cares. So we "have to" go back to the main chain. We are still free to go our own of course. So I do get your point.

" for those that accept their blocks ". So here it is. Those who accept those blocks voted for that (fork) by the mere fact that they accepted them. Those who don't accept still follow the rules they like, hence voted no (BCH rings a bell? :)). Miners can't dictate the rules for nodes.
What's better example for a "democracy"?

Important for those not familiar with fungibility:

What does it do with your bank? Coinbase will not be able to help either IMHO. Coins are gone, non reversible.
You must be careful where and how you store your keys (or in this case access "token").
If you use your phone you need to use a recent phone (which gets Android updates) and PIN in the app and fingerprint.   
I believe you can't do anything after the coins have been withdrawn from the exchange (and it is not the exchanges fault..).
Must be sad :(
@_date: 2019-03-17 15:30:20
They would still see the split payment one step earlier if they see the history of the coin (such simple step can serve as "plausible deniability though").
Fungibility is a big issue. Lightning network "solves it" - in a way.
I also read that there is an ongoing project (on the protocol level) which will/should solve this.
@_date: 2019-11-02 10:37:59
Nope. As all those calculations are checked by each node. So it doesn't matter (beside the owners) if the miners are safe or not as PoW is checked.

Sounds like a new fork is coming could be Bitcoin Photon?Or Bitcoin OPow? :)
Seriously sounds like a lot of BS. to me. I mean even if you assume that "optical computing" is here the logical part (eg. hash) is the same. So this could lead to faster miners on SHA256 too. It won't change that mining will be limited by profitability. If this way use 100x less energy/unit miners will build physically larger farms using as much energy as profitable.
@_date: 2019-11-20 19:32:18
No worries, if internet goes down so as the ATMs, banks and everything else.  
So it will be fixed (at least intra continent) soon if it ever goes down.  
In my experience even services people would never think do also depend on the internet even if it is not advertised or advertised the other way around.
Still it would be great to have a nice global Bitcoin repeater network (two way) with radios ;)

An X-code reflects currencies that are used internationally and so, XE has chosen to use **XBT** to represent **Bitcoin**. "

On the atomic level yes (as burning is not a reactor :)), but **not** on the molecular level. It really matters if it is CO what's emitted or CO2.
But burning is a complex process. It is not like in a textbook CH4 goes in and H2O (vapor) and CO2 comes out. There are dirty parts in the gas (and the air) to begin with (pollutants), just like in gasoline (and more in diesel).
And if the burning is not perfect (which never is) than CO (which is poisoning) will come out and not CO2 (which is good for plants). That's what happens in petrol cars, hence the catalytic converter which burns the bad CO and makes good CO2.
So controlled burn is MUCH cleaner than just flame something.

You split your coins to 20 addresses.
You create a new wallet with 20 addresses.You create (and sign) manually 20 time locked (not sooner than) transaction to the future where you transfer from one UTXO to on of the new addresses (and store these transaction WELL).Destroy the private keys (eg. first wallet).
You manually broadcast the transaction one-by-one when time comes.

@_date: 2019-01-23 02:52:59
No, electric grids will not "melt down". They may go (likely not) to emergency shutdown for a few hours. Bitcoin miners will not melt or go bad either.  HDDs will not be affected. They need magnitudes stronger "Gauss" to bother.
This was the largest flare, and only triggered a shutdown because the grid's alarm was too sensitive.
It is good to be prepared. So keep backups on optical disks too. Those are 100% solar flare safe :)

Not possible. Bitcoin is an open source open access network. Version visible remotely is only a string sent by that client. No guarantee it is true at all (it is not important as each full node checks EVERYTHING the network is just a bunch of unreliable (by design) proxies).
Anyone can change the "title" of its own node. Meaning this stats are based on the assumption that few people actually do.
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:46:38
So basically it was never sent. Just the website pre-deducted it from your account and than gave it back when they couldn't broadcast/construct the transaction.

Of course new consensus rules can help that easily :)
