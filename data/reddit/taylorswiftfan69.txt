How do you eat without money? I guess you could beg or look through rubbish bins behind restaurants. I'm not sure why you're asking that though.
@_date: 2015-12-16 13:20:25

@_date: 2015-12-14 21:23:35

We should all move there so we can live in bitopia. Everyone has to stand on one foot though or you'll fall off the edge.
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:15:05
I think it's ok that they don't get involved. They're too hysterical to be rational actors in the Bitcoin sphere.

So I guess a bank transfer is the safest way to transmit money.
@_date: 2015-12-15 15:28:37
@_date: 2015-12-14 12:59:56
You should buy some bitcoins. No one can take those away from you.
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:49:38
First they came for the cashiers, and I did not speak up, because I was not one of them.
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:25:09
Where are you spending your Bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-12-18 04:10:45
 Bitcoin is aesthetic as fuck.
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:11:28
I bet he's put most of his wealth in the coin already. This might be a subtle hint that things are going to pick up. Moon, anyone?

Bitcoin will most likely be heavily restricted in India, as it is in China.
@_date: 2015-05-26 09:25:34
It makes Bitcoiners look like sleazy maniacs.

It's making fun of expensive technology that does something you can already do better with existing technology. Like bitcoin.

I lolled when he said, "It was as if Satoshi himself was guiding us through the Blockchain. Have you read the white paper?."
@_date: 2015-05-21 10:56:45
Maybe heś friends with Satoshi? We have a right to know.

Homeless people are too deranged to understand the concept of bitcoin. It would be better to hand them a card that is redeemable for a few satoshis, and when bitcoin is worth millions they will be able to buy a house. Voila, homelessness solved.

MacIntosh are for the free-thinkers, 
@_date: 2016-01-24 13:52:32

Homeless people are good eating. Lots of lean muscle from walking the streets all day.
@_date: 2016-01-30 10:47:28
Better keep on snatching up them coins.
@_date: 2016-01-28 01:23:26
Sounds like the bigwigs are trying to muscle in on some of the action. Me? I'm just gonna keep snatching up them coins.
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:37:26
Spnding that much bitcoin means its either ransomware, drugs or child porn.
@_date: 2016-01-24 13:53:44

Bitcoin turned me into a heterosexual. I used to be a huge fag but after I starting trading bitcoin I stopped talking with a lisp and my wrists got real buff. Thanks bitcoin.

Is that Steve Jobs?
@_date: 2015-08-23 10:14:12
Likely they didn't give a crap about you.
@_date: 2015-07-29 15:41:30
What's similar about about them that would be evidence for bitcoins imminent success?
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:40:25
THIS IS GENRTLEMAN!

If your feet are cold you should just light your socks on fire.
@_date: 2016-02-21 13:34:58
Price is gonna go up. I hope you are ready for liftoff.
@_date: 2015-09-07 13:58:50
[This one]( is pretty interesting too.
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:31:28
It sucks dong.

The Chinese use the same word for Crisis as they do for Opportunity. This could be a good time to get peoples attention about bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-08 10:14:32
Yeah, it's not like that's ever happened before.
@_date: 2015-11-09 22:50:46

You can buy drugs with bitcoin, what do you know.
@_date: 2015-10-19 05:41:36
Bitcoin is off the chain!
@_date: 2016-07-30 15:09:33
It also displays your ignorance about economics.
@_date: 2016-07-30 22:51:32
Can you explain how these two bank notes illustrate that?
