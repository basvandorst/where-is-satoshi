I didn't say that the credit card system is the best system.  I said that having the entity coordinating the transfer cover everyone's risk of fraud is the best system,  because it is.  No one is going to want to use a system that leaves them high and dry if they get ripped off.

The irs already considers it a taxable asset.   It would be just like getting paid in stock

How does this make the "transition to bitcoin" any easier?  You realize that Bitcoin is a fungible commodity, right?  If I buy a product for "1 bitcoin", and then the seller immediately sells me back that bitcoin for $USD, what bitcoin has actually changed hands?  All that's really happened is I've paid in cash and the middleman has gotten to squeeze some money out of both me *and* the seller

...which is exactly the kind of simplicity that bitcoin don't offer

Dear God, are you kidding me?  Is there literally anything that y'all won't compare to slavery?

It also happens to be the best solution.  Self important snobbery aside, credit card fraud can happen to anyone.  I've never entered my info into any shady or non secure site,  in all likelihood someone probably skimmed it when I paid at a restaurant.   Short of not using my credit card, there's nothing I could have done to avoid that.  Given that any one of us could fall victim, it makes sense for everyone to pay for protection.


lel.  Sorry if I don't really buy the idea that a currency which requires a deep understanding of computer security and cryptography combined with constant vigilance to avoid having your life savings jacked is the future of money.

That's the price of having a system that doesn't require connectivity on the part of the purchaser at the time of transaction.  Turns out the public is willing to sacrifice some security for the ability to actually use the system in their day to day life
