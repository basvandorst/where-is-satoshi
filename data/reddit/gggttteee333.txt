No. They don’t. They will buy at any price at any time and charge you a spread. Stop talking about shit you don’t understand

No cons at all. Dca is the exact right strategy. Set it and forget it. See you on the moon ninnie

That’s not their business model at all. They don’t worry about “buy low sell high”, they charge a fee above or below spot no matter what the price of gold is. It’s called “the spread” and they will always be willing to buy or sell at any price because they make their money on the spread. These companies usually roughly hold the same amount of fiat and metals as a hedge and now it looks like they are working bitcoin into that model as well.
Stop talking out of your ass if you think gold companies try to “buy low sell high”. They are not traders and they don’t run a hedge fund tard.

If bitcoin actually does hit 100k in 2019, I’m gonna cry and be really scared. But also happy for my bitcoins!!!

BEWARE! If you try to cash out bitcoin into gold in order to avoid taxes, you can possibly get fucked. These gold companies are required to report purchases of over 10k to the IRS.
If you want to cash out btc into gold to avoid taxes, you have to do it in small amounts across various gold companies

Peter schiff talks shit all day about bitcoin but accepts it on his website and will trade gold for it. Lame
