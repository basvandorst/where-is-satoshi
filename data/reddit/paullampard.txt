Create multitude of forks:
Bitcoin 4x, Bitcoin 14x, Bitcoin 1024x, Bitcoin Kash, Bitcoin Qash, Bitcoin Cache, Bitcoin Cash Improved, Bitcoin Authentic, etc.
Beat them at their own fame. The more counterfeits there are the more the people will try to find out which is the true Bitcoin.

Generally good advice, but I find it confusing/contradictory on some points.
OP recommends dollar-cost averaging. But also cautions againts buying at ATH. Doesn't dollar-cost averaging mean you buy when it is time to buy whether ATH or ATL?

I am saying that 2017 was driven by market hysteria, not real supporters. You can see that in Google Trends. I am saying you ignore hysteria. If you want to have your judgment be swayed by hysteria and its after-effects, go ahead. There is, however, very strong rational (as opposed to hysterical) support. This includes people who support the ideology, people in awe of the tech, people who are convinced by the solid Stock to Flow pattern or other long term analyses, people in hyperinflationary countries for whom BTC is a lifesaver, and others with various other reasons for belief. And the bet is that these people will grow in number while the supply can only reduce.
@_date: 2019-11-10 17:55:08
The market is not perfect, nor homogenous. It is made up of long term hodlers, traders , whales, newbies, etc. Thus, I don't think it can ever be fully "priced in". Even if you believe it will reach a million dollars, how much can you buy? Would you sell everything you own to buy? And how impervious are you to the crazy market swings? Will you sell when the price tanks? Will you FOMO when the price rockets? There will always be some who cave in, both directions. But the reality is the supply will keep restricting relentlessly. There will come a time when people want to buy, but there is just not enough being sold, hence it will go up. It may take a while though, but I think it will happen. Unless some fatal flaw appears in Bitcoin. But after 10 years, nothing like that has appeared. Also,manias come in cycles. 2017 was a remarkable bull run. It will take a while before such a craze occurs again, I think. But the price will still keep going up. Notice it does not go back to below 4k any more? It will keep having higher lows. It is a matter of time before you see it never goes below 10k any more. But it just may not be as soon as you would like.

A few clarifications. This is analysis of long term trend, not for short term trading. And even then whether this will continue to hold is not certain. Lastly, he has a later model which included more data, including very early data, as he claimed. And he said the model held. Hence it is about 10 years' data.

What I see now is that 2017 year end was just a mania when everybody and their grandmas bought in, and so should be disregarded, and 2018 to mid 2019 was an over correction, and then a correction of that over correction, so what you are left with is still a healthy upward trend. So just zoom out and chill.

According to a post in a whale dumped 25k BTC in Coinbase. This caused price to drop as there will be panic selling and auto trades firing off. Said whale probably bought it all back. Estimated profit is 15m USD to buy back the same 25k BTC. But you don't lose if you keep a steady hand. Overall, we are still in recovery. This changes nothing. And the halving event is still only 1 year away. HODL!

ELI5: If tether is exposed as a scam, how would it cause other crypto prices to drop? People will be trying to get rid of tether, which means either cash out (good luck with that) or buy cryptos like BTC. Tether may crash and burn for all I care. But surely demand for BTC will go up and that means price goes up, right? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:22:04
Are you joking? Tether is the shittiest thing that happened in this market and shows how ignorant the market is.

Question: how can bitcoin be considered a store of value when its price is so volatile? You could buy at 16K and a few weeks later your funds drop by half in value. Is it only a store of value except when the price is too high? But with no way of determining its correct value unlike stocks, how to tell when the price is too high?
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:39:06
And you support tether? Centralised control. Pegged value. Lack of transparency. Can be printed/issued at will. It completely goes against what cryptocurrency is about. And that is without mentioning the really shady aspects.
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:06:16
From a purely TA perspective, there was a peak of 19k at 17-Dec followed by a big drop to 10k, a peak of 17k at 6-Jan followed by a drop to 9k, 12k peak at 28-Jan followed by drop to 6k. Each peak is lower than previous and also each drop more severe. Thus the recent recovery's failure to break 12k may be seen as significant and people may be expecting a drop below 6k. 
The market can be self fulfilling. Personally, I think the fundamentals are a lot stronger now. And I hope the sentiments will also prove more positive. Just keeping my fingers crossed that TA will prove wrong here.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:15:42
That depends on when you entered the market. If you started at 10k price, you would still feel the burn.

I have a question about the SegWit2x fork in November. Is it safe to keep my bitcoins in an exchange? Which of the 2 bitcoins will I own after the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-06 05:44:13
Thanks for patient explanations, BR. Even with the coins in a hardware wallet, isn't it still advisable to do a backup? Any hardware can develop failures. Not sure how a hardware wallet should be backed up. 
And does it mean that, if the coins remain in the wallet (not spent) there is ZERO risk of losing the coins after the fork? 
I am not so interested in splitting the coins. If it is difficult and risky, I would rather forego them. My primary concern is keeping the coins safe through the fork. 
Also, if I may clarify: after the fork, the main branch will be the one without SegWit2x; this will still be called bitcoin. Whereas the SegWit2x will fork off and be called something else. Is this correct?
@_date: 2019-09-17 03:11:48
Based on my own analysis of the multi year logarithmic growth trend since 2012, it should not dip below 10k after May next year. The length of time the trend has been holding gives some confidence. But still, the trend is your friend until...

It still bugs me that there is a limit to BTC supply. I know it is beyond our lifetimes, but wouldn't it be much better for halving events to stop after a certain point, so that there will continue to be miner incentives without huge fees?
Second, there is a lot of buzz about zero knowledge proofs. Without being too technical, is it possible for this to be implemented for bitcoin?
Thirdly, again in the far future: current developers probably have significant BTC holdings that incentivise them to work on the code to keep it secure and up to date. For future developers if they are too late to hold any significant amounts then what is to incentivise them to perform this very crucial role of code maintenance?

Bitcoin itself is scarce. But it has competitors. Some of them have much larger supplies. You may scoff at altcoins, but others see them as viable alternatives. So taken as a whole, cryptocurrencies are not as rare as the 21m limit of bitcoin may imply.
