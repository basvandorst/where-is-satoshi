I'm hoping it goes down to 11-12 tonight or early tomorrow so I can buy some

It's been at 15k less than 15 hours, and that's a safe floor? 
I think 5 is probably a safe floor.

In my mind, my btc are already worthless, so anything is gravy.  I've got a little to invest for fun, and anything that comes back is profit literally and figuratively.

I think fun is the right motivation here, unless you just dumped 100k in or something

Is it wrong to do a little of both?

Sure, but I bet a ton of those people buying it right now would also work for it and exchange goods for it, if they could.  Based on the market on Reddit, you could probably get some 16 year old to write a term paper for you for a .0001 bitcoin.

This seems positive lol

Hugged to death

Sarcasm noted, but my point is to respond to all those who only see it as a philosophical investment.  Obviously, it's current value greatly outweighs regular use--- hence very few places accept it.  But that has created a greater demand, not a lesser one.

The number of people who would give up things with real world value is growing by the second

Same thing happened to me right before I typed this

If instant transactions were a real thing, this would be more fun!

Bitcoin killed it
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:46:28
Theoretically, if bitcoin went to 0 would it wreak absolute havoc on global markets?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:48:32
If they did that, it would drive the price crazy high

Like pumping up the price to short the futures next week?  Nah, Wall Street peeps would never do that.
