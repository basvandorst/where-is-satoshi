very deep.  
Next year we are going to have an election and peacefully transfer power for the ~28th straight time.  We are certainly facing a large amount of social, economic, and political issues in this country, many of which have faced organized dissent, but I promise you there is no appetite for violent insurrection and civil war.
When your mom tells you she loves you, just give her the benefit of the doubt.  She did raise your ungrateful ass.

Ebay has employees and procedures devoted to removing that type of activity from their site (Go try to list some drugs on there and see what happens).  They act in good faith to provide a service that complies with all laws.  Silk Roads sole and advertised purpose was to sell illegal goods and services, Ross was not only aware of that, he explicitly designed it that way.  I didn't go read the actual text of section 230, but I believe that was intended to apply to Internet service providers are not websites.  If that wasn't the case then Time Warner and Comcast would be responsible for blocking access to internet content, "free and open" internet right?

Its not that he didn't care, it was the sole purpose of the site, it was advertised and built to accomplish one task and one task only.  Facilitating the transaction of ILLEGAL goods.

They are separate.  We live in a complex society and everyone has their own definition of morality.  Which is why we get together and ELECT a government to agree on laws.  The laws don't match everyone's definition of morality but as a part of living in and benefiting from this society we agree to follow them.  
I consider what Ross did to be Immoral AND Illegal.
Also, just because laws exist (in literally every place on earth and pretty much as far back in known history as we can possibly see) does not mean individuals can't develop their own morality.  If there isn't a law about being honest or treating people kindly then you don't have to do it right?

There's that ducking the question to prevent a challenge to my black and white world view.
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:24:09
No, but frankly that is a silly comparison.  The Nazi's were a fascist totalitarian government who had by that point invaded multiple countries, started a world war, and were perpetuating genocide on a startling scale.  Ross was selling drugs for profit.
I would concede that the question of morality vs legality is a tremendously complex question that is always difficult to answer.  This comparison however (Protecting a group of people from mass robbery and genocide v. selling drugs for MILLIONS of dollars in profits) is willfully ignorant and useless in this context.
@_date: 2015-06-02 17:09:22
Almost no rules apply universally.  People are too complex.  I'll restate:
The question of morality vs. legality is a tremendously complex question that is always difficult to answer for people smart enough to see beyond the lens of their own beliefs.
We live in a society my friend, the actions of people affect other people.

Beanie Babies and Pogs were also super popular in schools.  This is good for Bitcoin if it provides a legitimate use case for ADULTS.
This is certainly something to take notice of, but your 3rd paragraph is silly.  Your parents giving your allowance in bitcoin is not a realistic use case.

This isn't really an analogy, or an effective one.  You just replaced the word "network" with "set of train tracks" and "Bitcoin" with train car.
Imagine Global citizens build a network that covers the entire world and on this network there exists at most only 21 million bitcoins.  If you own a bitcoin you can ship it over the network..
Transporting a bitcoin only requires one or two parties...
People might feel like you are insulting their intelligence with this type of analogy.

Freedom is a societal concept not an individual one.  Its a compromise that people in a society make with each other.  Without that fabric its just a Darwinian existence, there is no freedom in that.  Just a viscous fight for survival.

Also a parent.  The point of an allowance is to teach my kid to make decisions based on scarcity and need.  A speculative asset that he can't spend [Is difficult to spend] is not a use case that is going to lead to adoption.
Young adults most certainly lead the way in deciding whether or not something is cool, but for bitcoin to be successful it needs use cases that apply to people who actually have money.

At a mfg facility customers have not yet purchased a product or entrusted the company with their funds.  Therefore the company only owes an explanation to themselves.  A public exchange has a fiduciary responsibility to explain what happened to their customers money.  Frankly anyone who continues to do business with them without at least some kind of proof of reserves or explanation of the breach is asking for trouble.

Its about market, not effort.  If there was no incentive to produce art then no art would be produced.  WE (collectively) incentivize creativity.  You just want other people to pay for it for you.  Leeching off the system and the hard work and money of others.

By qualifications you mean the diploma they cheated to obtain?

Why is being talented **AND** hard working mutually exclusive?  
You can't be both?  Some people work smart **and** hard, they are also honest about what work is their own and what isn't.
You going to hire someone else to do your work for you as well one day?  Maybe someone better at it?  Hopefully your company never finds out.
There is no situation where passing something off as your own when it isn't is right.  That is called lying.
Integrity isn't important to you, I get it.  That is why we are always going to disagree.
@_date: 2015-11-25 18:25:36
Because you are lying to your employer, that you completed the necessary work to be a graduate of your university.  You are lying to the University (that you are paying to certify you as a graduate...) that you completed the work they require for graduation.  If you don't believe college has any value then just be real about it and don't go to college, instead of lying and cheating your way through it.
Regardless of the topic the ability to perform research and articulate analysis is a skill.

right but if you can just pay tuition and get a diploma that diploma isn't going to be worth anything to employers.  There are plenty of diploma mills where you can go online and just pay to get a degree, and employers don't value those at all.  I acknowledge that *what* you learn in college isn't always tremendously valuable, but completing the program with integrity says something about you.  I wouldn't hire someone if I knew they cheated like this.
@_date: 2015-11-24 21:16:06
By cheating you are devaluing the education you are paying to get anyway.  Lots of people elect not to get secondary education because it doesn't make sense for them.

Its the power rule.  The larger the market the harder it is to attain 1%.  The more pragmatic way to look at it is.
"If 10 Mil people moved their money into bitcoin....."  
Tons of people have used this cliched assumption in their business plans.  Calling it 1% of a market is just a way to make it seem easier and more realistic.  It's sort of a cop out, that's why I usually dismiss anyone who talks about 1% of a market.

Classic pump and dump.  You need to make other people think that:


Also, supply usually can be manipulated, while in most cases demand can't be.  Whats why we have markets.
@_date: 2015-10-30 15:08:09
Saying 1% is just a way to make it seem smaller and easier.  The more accurate statement would be:
"If 10 Million Chinese people moved all of their deposits to bitcoin...."
Convincing 10 million people to buy bitcoin is difficult whether its 1% of China or 50% of Beijing.  That is the 1% fallacy.
