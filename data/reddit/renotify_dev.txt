I see, thanks for the response.

Great, that's good to know.
@_date: 2014-12-02 00:57:18
But when you add a new contact to your phone, or when you pay directly to someone's bank account you still need numbers.
Maybe some people are working on a DNS-like system but the point is is doesn't exist yet, and there's no indication of when it will. Namecoin already have a working system and nobody has adopted it due to the difficulty of a changing the protocol.
I'm proposing a much simpler solution. Hopefully it would only be temporary and would be replaced with names, but at the moment there's no proper system for that.
@_date: 2014-12-02 13:03:25
If you're copy/pasting there's no point using this over a traditional address. I intended it more for cases where an address would have to be manually typed in.
@_date: 2014-12-01 22:34:13
Yep, [QR code generation](
No matter how hard we try to convince ourselves otherwise, QR codes are really awkward.

Great! 20 bits @_date: 2014-12-01 22:36:40
It's a nice approach, but to be honest I still think it's too unusual for widespread public adoption. People don't like things they aren't familiar with, and no one (except us computer nerds) uses strings of random words to denote things.
We need a system with only decimal numbers.
@_date: 2014-10-27 20:45:01
The Android system actually does security very well. Without root permissions, no app can modify or even view any file belonging to another app, and can't change how an app works (aside from when there are intents set up to let other apps handle a certain feature).
You can also see the exact capabilities every app has based on its permissions.

Edit - dev here, commented from the wrong account at first
Hi, thanks for your suggestions.
The app's main activity is probably only going to be open for a few seconds at a time when you're setting the reminder so I don't see much need to add a refresh button. Even if someone leaves it open for a while for some reason, pressing back and then opening the app again doesn't take much. Obviously it'll automatically check the block number in the background regularly, it just doesn't update this on the main screen because it won't normally be left open for long.
You're right about the donation thing, I'll change that.
Do you mean when you installed it from Google play it didn't automatically make an icon? That's weird, I've no idea why it'd do that.
Edit- I'm not able to reproduce your bug, I'll try a bit more. It might be something happening with the blockchain.info API. Thanks for pointing it out.
@_date: 2014-12-02 02:02:57
Care to explain why?
A merkle tree sent along with the address could prove that the transaction was included in the block, and a query to a handful of full nodes would be enough to accept that the block hash is correct.
@_date: 2014-10-29 02:33:01
I added this feature if you want to check it out.
@_date: 2014-12-02 02:36:41
Yep. i think a few trusted servers should be enough.
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:07:53
It didn't for me.
20 bits @_date: 2014-12-02 00:33:56
AFAIK, most wallets will make the send address the first output and the change address the second.
A -2 could be added to the end to note it's the second output (if no third number is present it would be assumed it's the first), but I think in most cases it won't be needed.
@_date: 2014-10-27 21:09:29
@_date: 2014-12-01 22:01:01
Very true, but I don't think addresses are going away any time soon. Bank account numbers, sort codes, phone numbers have been around for years. Sure there are mobile banking apps that let you 'Send money to my friend Dave' but account numbers will never go away, and I think much the same applies to Bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2014-10-29 02:14:30
You're welcome, enjoy it!
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:40:43
The color code is a great idea. I was thinking about writing the first few digits of the expected address next to the short address for verification, but color would be much cleaner.
The only problem is it wouldn't work over phone, etc. Maybe a combination of the two.
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:01:57
That's awesome, I didn't even think of that. I'll edit the OP.
@_date: 2014-10-29 01:59:09
I hope it's okay to post this here, given that the app is free and this feature was asked for by a number of users. I won't make any more threads after this.
[Original thread](
@_date: 2014-12-01 21:45:12
Good point on the reorg. I was thinking that addresses wouldn't be stored in this format, just used to easily exchange addresses between people, and then stored as actual addresses. Maybe donation addresses still in use after a reorg could be 're-registered' with a small transaction.
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:37:59
I appreciate your point of view. It very much is a kick the can down the road solution, but with no one else kicking the can it seems like an appropriate thing to do.
4-digit numbers of tx's in a block should hold out for at least a few more years, and they're a certainty until the developers decide to increase the block size limit. The block number itself won't gain another digit for something like 10 years.
This would make things easier until something proper is introduced.
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:56:08
It can, it just take the last transaction either to/from the address.
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:30:33
Bar codes are meant for reading with special laser devices.
Don't tell me you've never had problems focusing on a QR code, or reading one in low light, or seeing one online and having to jump through hoops to decode it on a website or in an app.
Entering a 9-digit number into a keypad is nearly always going to be faster IMHO.
@_date: 2014-10-29 04:20:43
That's a good idea actually. I think I'll add an option for "last transaction on address x", and it can automatically fetch the txid and add a reminder.
Edit - it's coming in an update.
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:21:51
Thanks! 20 bits @_date: 2014-12-01 22:40:43
I think it'd be best to keep it in decimal. It'll add a couple of digits, but it's what people are familiar with.
I think in decimal format it could be compared to a phone number. Adding letters would throw people off.
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:30:49
Maybe the receiver didn't have internet access.

The bit about the risk was a quote from the OP.
Sure, if you're using a trusted server, there's little risk, but you have to remember you're literally querying a server for "What address should I pay my bitcoins to?". There's nothing to stop any server operator going rogue and pointing everybody towards their own address. The risk is very remote but can't be ignored.
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:09:21
It hasn't gone through.
Thanks for your feedback 20 bits @_date: 2014-10-29 15:33:48
Many services require a certain amount of confirmations before you can use deposited coins (e.g. exchanges). To avoid having to check back for confirmations, this app lets you know when they're done.
It was, but that's unrelated.
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:29:20
I don't know to be honest. They all say "included in block" so I guess you're looking at the one that confirmed. The unconfirmed ones have probably just been forgotten about, given that the most recent one was a couple of hundred blocks ago. 
Spent vs unspent tells you whether the output has been spent yet by the receiver.
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:09:33
20 bits @_date: 2014-10-30 02:57:32
Just to let you know, I added the green icon and the remembering of the states of the checkboxes in the last update. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 13:15:54
You're correct, yeah. Each confirmation means more work has been done confirming your transaction, and the consensus is that after 6 it'd be absolutely impossible for anyone to undo (except in the case of a 51% attack).
[There are always a handful of transactions flagged as double spend attempts.](  One reason is that people sometimes send a transaction without any fee and it might take a long time to confirm, so they send it again with a fee. Once the second one confirms, the first will be forgotten about.
@_date: 2014-10-27 22:54:39
There's a checkbox in Google play settings, "Add icon to home screen", are you sure you didn't accidentally uncheck it at some point?
Thanks for your ideas in  as well, I'll consider adding that list, and I think I'll go ahead and drop the length of the vibration a bit.
@_date: 2014-12-01 21:58:37
Maybe is could be written as 306695-174-2 (vmWx) to show what it's supposed to look like, without forcing the user to enter extra awkward characters. If anyone loses money by both mistyping the address and disregarding the check that'd be their own fault.
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:12:04
Thanks for all the ideas.
It checks for new blocks every minute. To be honest I don't think there's a need for customization, 1 minute is frequent enough for getting notifications but not so frequent that it wastes resources.
I'll add a list and a countdown for upcoming active reminders. I might have a go at the whole txid thing because so many have suggested it.
Thanks a million for the donation!

The problem is that there's no universal, blockchain-based way of doing it. Even firstbits is too complicated for most people to consider, in my experience no one is familiar with anything other than passwords being case-sensitive.
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:37:03
[I went ahead and made it.]( (Commenting from my other account)
@_date: 2014-10-27 22:50:06
Thanks for the suggestion. That'd be a bit more complicated. To be honest you might be better off pasting the tx hash into blockchain.info.
Edit - thanks for the gold!
@_date: 2014-10-29 05:34:20
Both good suggestions, I'll stick them into an update.
To be honest I'm not looking for development work, I'm just a student with a week off looking for something productive to do. Wouldn't mind a few tips though ;)
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:04:27
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:30:28
That's pretty cool, but I still doubt people would accept that a group of words is their receiving address.
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:36:13
I suppose so yeah. I'm having  a play around with the icon and the transparent background does look pretty good, I think I'll change it.
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:33:01
I wonder why no one uses it, it certainly sounds like a good system.
@_date: 2014-10-29 02:33:20

@_date: 2015-05-29 19:41:08
[The current record is 173,297,972.]( It won't be easy to beat, but I'm interested to see how much we can move.
@_date: 2014-12-01 21:47:10
Thanks for the feedback.
Surely it wouldn't be too difficult to include something to say that the expected address "Looks like 16x4J..."
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:45:04
Highest I've seen the number of transactions is 5,666 from bc.i. Maybe the data is wrong.
Edit: yep, the data was wrong
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:26:04
I'd love to know what those numbers were before this began.
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:42:46
He mentioned this [here](
@_date: 2014-10-27 23:25:35
It's possible, but would it not be just as fast to paste it straight into blockchain.info?
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:06:40
Only a singe block was found during the hour, which certainly drives that number higher. I don't think the network got as stressed as everybody was hoping it would.
@_date: 2015-05-30 15:05:13
Because there were several megabytes of transactions sitting unconfirmed. With the 1 MB cap, anyone with a few thousand dollars to spare could block transactions with normal fees.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:25:47
I'm afraid not, you have to refresh the page frequently to get the right numbers.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:16:39
Not that I know of, that's why I'm doing this.
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:35:54
For each transaction, it's the number of bitcoins sent * the number of days they've been sitting dormant. It's supposed to give a better indication of how much activity is occurring than volume alone.
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:38:02
I'm logging and graphing the data myself, I'll post a few updates over the course of the night.
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:59:10
I'm keeping a log of the number, size and fees of unconfirmed transactions. Hopefully I'll be able to show off some pretty graphs after (and during) this.
