It's not so metaphysical.
Look at bitcoins like you do when you travel abroad.
You just start thinking with the money you are using in the contry you are.
When you are in the US do you think about how much euro do you have on your wallet?
Spending and using bitcoins in your daily life is not common yet, that may be the problem.

[How I see this thread.](
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:34:16
It's simple:
Consider the value is just the price that is being paid at a given time.
Let's also consider the market is buying a lot, so the prices will go up (because there is a bigger demand).
Prices will go up if the trade is made with a bigger price.
But there was a huge sell order (like 8000 BTC) with a price that was just cheaper than the other prices (in this case it was US$69,00).
So, every time someone buys, the price that is activated is the cheap price. That's how the system works, so the buyer will get automatically the best price.
If you place an order to buy for $70 a BTC, you will buy for $69.
That is the wall: someone is selling a huge amount of bitcoins for a price that is cheaper than what the buyer will pay. The price will not go above $69 because that's the price on all the trades.
If the demand is HUGE (like it was), the wall falls when the last bitcoin of this order is sold.

Game Theory shows perfectly this problem.
Want some peace? You need some guns.
Don't have guns? War it is.
We would need a strong strategy to build a true succesful state just using money.
You can't be seen as a treat.
Money is only useful inside an established economy.
Words would be our best resource: a new culture and lots of diplomacy.
A state just starts existing when people **believe** it exists.
Maybe the best way to build this kind of state would be creating an online subculture where people start identifying themselves as members of a new nation.
A charismatic leader would be the best start.
I will quit before we start a religion.

So, your objective is to found a sovereign state. 
A nation is more about culture. This takes more time and, as I see, is not the primary objective here.
So, let's plan in **realistic** terms: 


It has: 
*  a permanent population, 
* a government, and 
*  the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. [(2\)](
So, let's make a list of our materials organized as a progression:
* Political Organization;
* Territory (land);
* Centralized Government with independent authority and capable of being diplomatic;
* Population
The progression would be like this:
1. First we need to get organized to set the plans for a new nation;
 
2. Then, we need to acquire land;
 
3. After this, we need to establish an organized government;
 
4. Finally, people will come and go through our nation's borders.
The problems are:
* Buying Independent Land equals problems: if it is being sold for our objetive, probably we will have a poor or weak neighborhood. A powerful or rich country would never sell us some of its territory. Huge states are now almost at war for small pieces of land. (China and Japan; UK and Argentina)
* Seastanding would be very expensive, maybe not viable;
* We need someone that is charismatic or powerful enough to convince people and other states that we have a good idea. A new government will cause war if it is not diplomatic enough.
* History tells us that powerful new states have huge problems with other states and nations.
* How to be peaceful and deal with military power around us?
**TL;DR: 90% of our time would be spent writing legal documents and talking to powerful people, 10% would be spent in hard work.****Consider that this "small part" (10%) is preparing a WHOLE territory.**

I am brazilian and also have noticed this.
This is how it could work: some american buys bitcoins using us dollars then sends them to a brazilian that buys reais on mercadobitcoin. After this transaction you could use paypal to send the money back.
With a simple spreadsheet we could calculate how much this would be efficient.
The market would quickly adjust itself from the sudden offer of bicoins and the prices would go down.
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:31:51
My only advice: do not invest what you can't lose.
@_date: 2013-03-21 14:02:26
It's a bet:
* If people really believe a bitcoin is worth $70 or more, we will have a new price established.
Probability: low, but realistic. Could happen if: the world economy shows any instability right now or people (with lots of money) "discover" bitcoin as a reserve.
 
* If most of the price rise is because of people are just speculating, then we will soon see a strong herd behavior. Then, prices will drop to something more realistic.
Probability: high. The prices will drop as soon as the first user sells a large amount of coins for a lower price or will drop slowly in some days. Pay attention on the volume of the transactions.
Don't tell anyone, but now you know my bet.

A brainwallet uses a key to make your wallet safe.
Only the person that knows the "magic words" can get the money using the private key.
"Correct horse Battery Staple" is the default key because it's a reference to a comic [(XKCD)](
