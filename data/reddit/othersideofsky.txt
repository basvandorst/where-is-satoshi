There's a difference between being afraid and selling high to buy back in low since there actually is proven whale manipulation. Are you deliberately ignorant or just born that way?

while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything. And mastered the violin. Oop, and sold more paper.

I find it hard to think you know anything about taxes if you can't even distinguish between a refund and a tax return. Guess what, nomenclature actually does matter in the financial world.

I keep most of my stacks as hold positions. When I feel like gambling and see big movement on the chart candles I will transfer some coins to the exchanges to sell and re-buy on the dips. Sometimes I make my stacks larger, sometimes I make $2, sometimes I lose a little. It's really fun!

Best way to explain short position: imagine your friend loans you a PS4 because you don't want to buy one at the current value of $300. Instead of using it to play games and return it, you sell it on craigslist for $300. Next week the value of PS4's drops to $250 and you buy one off craigslist for $250 and pocket that $50 you made the week before. That's shorting. Betting the value will drop and borrowing against that, pocketing the profit.
