to answer all of this in one go, the piece of the puzzle you are missing is that the difficulty of mining adjusts to the mining power.

yes, or sit on it for a few buys and then do it all as one transaction.

just a screenshot of this.

even if it was, it wouldn't be in their interest to reveal. Satoshi isn't the only mysterious code donor and won't be the last.

I agree completely, but lets face it you don't design a network that'll take decades to reach its final mature form without expecting a few speedbumps along the way. 
At the moment we're paying a premium in time and money not from the network itself but as the networks way of protecting us from malicious intent (I'm referring to transaction fees and transfer times, not dollar value). In a sense it's working as intended.
Eventually we'll get to fast AND safe, but lets not rush it because we want things *now*.

syncing a full node is already extremely painful with 1mb blocks. It took me WEEKS to sync one recently on a 100mbit connection.

stop, new version install, start.

Yeah I think its currently at about ~165 gig. It came down in trickles of 200kb/s or so about once a minute and would stop (connected to 8 other nodes at all times). 
If the process dies for a few hours and you have to sync back up it's another 45 frustrating minutes or so.
I can only imagine the frustration of syncing BCH with larger block sizes and less nodes.

doing the transactions fast or cheap wasn't really mentioned either. I'm just not sure the huge asymmetry between miners and users in hashing time power was expected at the time and we were meant to be more proactive in keeping them 'honest'.
My personal take from the whitepaper was that doing it safely, honestly and decentralized was more important than doing it quick or cheaply ever was.
I'm not sure if store of value or fast/cheap transactions was the intention, ideally both. But I think the former is priority before tackling the latter with any rushed temporary measures.

please be careful.
don't put in money you would miss and loan money will put you in a worse position if you lose it.
If you're 100% convinced on this, I genuinely hope it pays off for you, but it's a big risk.

I've been through this and here is my suggestion. Decide if you want to trade or just go along for the ride.
after the stress and the not sleeping I decided I was along for the ride. I decided I think it's right for me, that I wouldn't' put huge amounts in and I'd stick with what I felt was right long term.
so last week I sold nothing, bought a few dips on the drop and didn't watch the market unless it was just out of the pure curiosity of it all.
I read about btc and the alternatives, decide what I think is the most inline with my opinion and just stick with it.

for convenience and easy of payment - good.
on everything else not so much.
You should mention what country you're from so people can suggest a local exchange.

*just* hit an ATH and we don't know which way futures is gonna take it.
Just wait a little
If it starts to gain momentum you can always jump on and if it drops then you've got an opportunity to take advantage of.

to be totally transparent here, turns out weeks was embellishing, it did take 11 days though running 24/7.

they'll still be needed for transactions and will earn from transaction fees.
