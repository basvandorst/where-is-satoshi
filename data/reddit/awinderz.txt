Damn, this is some nice formatting. This should have way more upvotes.
* Isn't high inflation an opportunity rather than a risk? 
* I would say the chances of a more successful coin emerging are 100% given a long enough timeline. 
* Extra respect for calling it the 50% attack. 
* What about the lack of mining incentives causing transaction costs to rise as new coin production slows?

Wallets should allow you to choose which method you want to use to  **SEND** coins. It's when you buy, sell or trade the coin that is a taxable event. So the wallets should let you choose FIFO/LIFO and that way you can file your taxes based on the specific identification method (where each transaction is accounted for).

Most people are probably here to make money. If you want to fix the government, get involved in politics directly. Bitcoin isn't going to solve the world's money problems. The majority will always believe in some limits on private wealth, taxation and even inflation.

Just my opinion but I don't think "impractical" is going to fly, especially on a system that is based on a public ledger. In an audit I'm assuming you would be asked for Coinbase records, bank records, wallet records, any exchange you used for arbitrage, etc. The IRS deals with plenty of businesses that have very complex accounting to follow. I'm pretty sure someone has already tried the "it was too hard to keep track of everything" method.

How gold is created, according to Wikipedia:  
Neutron star collisions occur in a fashion similar to type 1a supernovae. When two neutron stars orbit each other closely, they spiral inward as time passes. When the two neutron stars meet, their collision leads to the formation of a black hole (assuming their combined mass exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit). This creates a magnetic field that is trillions times stronger than that of Earth, in a matter of one or two milliseconds. Astronomers believe that this event is what creates certain kinds of gamma-ray bursts.[7] Images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that gold is yielded, along with many other heavy metals, from a violent neutron star collision. These collisions, which happen once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in this galaxy, may account for all the gold in the universe.  
Of course, all the gold on earth was formed billions of years ago.
How Bitcoin is created:  
Bitcoins are created as a reward for payment processing work in which users offer their computing power to verify and record payments into the public ledger. This activity is called mining and is rewarded by transaction fees and newly created bitcoins.  
The successful miner finding the new block is rewarded with newly created bitcoins and transaction fees.[39] As of 2014, the reward amounts to 25 newly created bitcoins per block added to the block chain. To claim the reward, a special transaction called a coinbase is included with the processed payments.[10] All bitcoins in circulation can be traced back to such coinbase transactions. The bitcoin protocol specifies that the reward for adding a block will be halved approximately every four years. Eventually, the reward will be removed entirely when an arbitrary limit of 21 million bitcoins is reached c. 2140, and record keeping will then be rewarded by transaction fees solely

In the case you describe you could just have two wallets to keep them separate. Since you would be using the specific ID method for all of your sells it would be beneficial overall to have this option.

First of all, not everyone agrees with you. Google Adam levitin bitcoin. Secondly, nobody is saying anything about serial numbers but you.

The bigger it gets the more likely it is to collapse, because it needs a constant supply of new money to grow. The current price is based on speculation and not on the usefulness of the virtual currency at present day. He predicts the price will peak at less than 10,000 because as it gets larger potential future gains diminish. 
From investopedia:
"As an example, assume that company X has a market capitalization of $400 billion and company Y has a market capitalization of $5 billion. In order for company X to grow by 50%, it must increase its market capitalization by $200 billion, while company Y would only have to increase its market capitalization by $2.5 billion. The law of large numbers suggests that it is much more likely that company Y will be able to expand by 50% than company X. "

Yea, dissenting opinions should just be silenced. Forget about the opportunity to make a sound argument and win the debate. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

When people tell the world they're buying or selling. There are no good reasons for announcing those things. 
Remember when Kevin Rose tweeted that he sold most of his bitcoins at 300? 
Was he trying to make himself look smart?  Influence others to sell? Warn people about the dangers of bitcoin?

I suggest anyone who was influenced by this post read about the causes of the great depression and the actions the government took to prevent it from happening again.

This subreddit needs more moderation. Really a lot of this is bad for the image of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 22:28:30
Yup. Believe it or not this doesn't make the price go up.

Antifragile has more ideas that apply directly to Bitcoin.

Now the informed, wealthy investors wont want to buy :-)

Bitcoin is a controversial subject for people that don't understand it. They may have read in the news that it is used for buying drugs and online gambling. It's always a good idea to check with your teacher about the subject or topic of the assignment before putting a lot of work into it.
On a side note this is probably why many won't buy Bitcoins right now. They're afraid the government hasn't approved it and they might get a '0'.

Reddit in general tends to down-vote criticism. The users in r/bitcoin are generally no more sophisticated than posters you'll see on the front page.

People in finance probably use the term differently than people in mathematics would.
It makes more sense if you look at it in terms of GDP. Take APPLE, one of the largest companies in the world. Apple's market cap is 500 billion. If it doubled again that would be 1 trillion. Again, 2 trillion. At some point it would be worth more than the entire industry, and at some point more than the entire US economy. Obviously it would be a joke to say that Apple's market cap will reach 16 trillion.

Never. IPOs are purposely designed to make a small number of people a large amount of money.

A lot of people believe (perhaps falsely) that Bitcoin will resolve problems with existing monetary systems. When governments ban or over regulate then the appearance of trying to bolster existing systems is given.  
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:04:12
Agree with you there.

Remember when bitcoin destroyed billions of dollars in value? OH yeah, I guess that never happened before.

Everyone who took out a sub prime loan and defaulted? Anyone who made such a loan?  Anyone who bought and sold derivatives of such loans?  Government officials who encouraged such loans in order for low income people to buy houses?
What is the list for , are you going to send them a satoshi?

Yea people who fall for this probably have about $8 to invest.

He is implying that printing money will cause people to invest in a lot of things, including Bitcoin and drive asset inflation. He doesn't quite "get" Bitcoin but uses it as an example.

Really depends on the reason behind it. Why is the person deciding to cash out?

Some people also need to realize what the federal reserve actually does. There is a lot of hyperbole that should be taken with a grain of salt.

Why would anyone want it to grow to $100,000? Other than that they could profit off the backs of people that bought in at a later point?
