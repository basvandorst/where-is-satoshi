Can’t 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:30:37
I’ve been waiting for a dip since 9000
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:15:08
Eventually when? So now I have to pay way more than I was supposed to?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:27:35
That wasn’t my first though
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:08:08
How does an ad blocker work
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:11:53
What if you’re transferring one btc
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:11:45
How much does it usually cost?
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:20:44
Correct. It auto corrected 
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:58:38
Is it complicated to go to GDAX and then to nano?
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:24:09
Very good reasons
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:24:00
Gold something. A bunch of stuff people are saying. Should I just transfer it to nano the second I get it?
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:07:36
Is that reliable tho?
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:44:01
Is it easier to go from coinbase to nano? Gdax sounds complicated 
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:21:26
I don’t know how to do that
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:09:33
I don’t even know what bitcoin gold is
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:09:22
Can you explain to me what that is?
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:11:32
How much is the fee? I only plan on sending it once and hodling for years
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:34:25
What’s the different with using gdax and not using it
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:09:57
What about exchange rates and what not. Is it worth buying the nano?
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:10:47
Move them why?
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:27:56
Awesome thank you
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:04:41
Awesome thank you very much
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:21:09
So if I want to send coins from coinbase to a nano what is my best option?
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:29:43
Never used gdax before. How’s it work. It asks to make an account and wants my ssn last 4
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:08:43
What app is that?
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:59:41
But what if I don’t want to put in any personal information
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:12:07
Why two?
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:30:13
What is the bitgold everyone is talking about
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:20:20
How do you do that?
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:35:44
