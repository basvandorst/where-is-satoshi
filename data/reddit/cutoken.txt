its easy.
create a blank html and coinmarketcap offers each currency widget, so paste into that in html body. you see only those coins which you have pasted there. 
You are done.
Here is a sample HTML which I use:
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="
&lt;div width="100%" height="100%" style="display: inline-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="coinmarketcap-currency-widget" data-currency="bitcoin" data-base="USD" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="coinmarketcap-currency-widget" data-currency="ethereum" data-base="USD"  data-secondary="BTC"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="coinmarketcap-currency-widget" data-currency="bitcoin-cash" data-base="USD"  data-secondary="BTC"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="coinmarketcap-currency-widget" data-currency="eos" data-base="USD" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

satoshi's dice?

You can start changing block history backward one block everytime till whole chain is consistent with the changes.
If you do it on 51% of the nodes, this changed chain makes up the majority and will be the valid chain

I see the merit in your argument, but what I was trying to say that bitcoin having mentioned advantage at the moment is much more resilient to newer coins and technologies until they prove both their technology and acceptance.
Everything that rises have to fall for another superior thing. What matters is how long will it survive.

I think this was already factored in the long term vision.
What else was considered which can come to rescue:
1. Making transactions low cost, fast and efficient so that more and more transaction do happen in mainstream.
2. Though smaller, the higher iterations will yield a handsome transaction incentives for miner.
3. Whenever  mining cost and availability becomes disproportional, EDA algorithm can bring them back to equilibrium by readjusting difficulty. Remember, difficulty is not an ever increasing number. It is the rider to maintain the equilibrium between mining competition and miner availability.
If the higher transaction volume can not be achived using bitcoin because of consensus to change in technology or because of heavy price, there are already Layer two technologies and sidechains in work which can be built on Bitcoin blockchain to help both Bitcoin and themselves.

(I don't know how many satoshis that would be)

blockchain.info with 2fa is good as only encrypted wallet is on cloud

You are trying compare google search and everyday sprawling search engine (not a good analogy though). Pioneering the technology, community support, wider acceptance, brand value, early mover advantage, trend-setter, democratice roadmap, all of these which sets bitcoin apart from alt-coins.

Create a Linux USB Distro. Setup offline wallet and keys imported. Set a pretty strong password with 2FA to log-in to linux and keep the USB with your nominee along with the password.
Demo them atleast once with small amount how they should usb to claim the fund in case of eventuality.
In most suggestions, More often than not, they might get your keys but won;t know how to successfuly claim them and convert them to fiat. Involving a 3rd paerson to do it for you is as good as pasting your private keys on doorstep.
So do atleast a couple of transactions with your nominee to educate them . And do that now, you might not get a chance as early as tomorrow itself

Heavy number of transactions globally has choked mempool.

Write with a thin permanent marker behind your 2 doors in small font, half half or in alternate order. Doors don't go anywhere

don't attach anything to your mobile. its called 'mobile' for a reason.

It translates to :
If anyone buys Bitcoin in JPMorgan, he will be thrown out.
People buying Bitcoin are idiot, and its dangerous to have idiots in bank.
What about idiots at home? Poor daughter :(
