i know this is kind of a joke comment but i think it's partially true.
my best friend is greek. he said himself, given the choice between being employed in england and unemployment in greece, he chose greece. "at least we have nice weather there and enjoy our lives" is what he said to me.

when a miner submits a block, who determines if it's legit? couldn't another miner steal the block and submit it as their own?

during mining, who 'judges' whether a proposed block is correct? can another miner steal a proposed block and say they created it?

i have the same strategy.

i don't think that really applies. it's similar, but in that system the stakes rise exponentially and there's a 50/50 chance you win/lose on each coin flip. so the theory is the exponential growth eventually wipes out the gamblers reserves on a consecutive losing streak.
with bitcoin, the stakes are your decision. and the game isn't a series of 50/50 coin flips.
