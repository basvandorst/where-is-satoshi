That’s what deposit means lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:33:13
Idk what you mean, when you buy on an exchange you aren’t actually buying bitcoin, you’re essentially buying the right to the bitcoin they have 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:59:54
That’s not how it works on exchanges lol 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:04:16
I mean it sucks for the nicehashers lol 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:28:42
Are you new to this? Exchanges don’t charge actual transaction fees.. that’s only when sending bitcoin... 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:29:28
the 100 bucks I had accumulated would've been really nice lol. Not life saving but this still stinks. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:06:22
I just deposited twice this week with them, one of the times being yesterday 
Edit: 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:46:40
Because it’s a bullshit sob story trying to get people to give him bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:28:37
You just wouldn’t be mining Bitcoin but it can be profitable depending on other factors 
Peep the sidebar of r/gpumining
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:16:35
Refreshed and just dropped my jaw 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:27:41
Hopefully it’s true man! Congrats! 
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:30:22
Np, lmk if you have any questions. Simple enough but you never know, best of luck babe. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:24:07
Coinbase only has 2% of their BTC on online wallets
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:18:12
Yeah I don't really see what everyone is freaking out about
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:24:36
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:53:32
look up GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:27:50
4 BTC? I'll help you out but you realize that's 40K right
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:15:51
Put in $300, I have around $629 rn
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:25:56
GDAX, Coinbase, Bittrex, etc
Google bitcoin exchanges 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:53:22
Yeah haha, the two coins I bought have doubled so I'm feeling good right about now 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:31:05
What? I put 200 in a few weeks ago and just sold for 300 lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:19:56
I just did tho ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:12:28
lmao I'd love to try and help you dude, you could low key be rich. Do you remember how many bitcoins you mined?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:11:18
You can buy a fraction of a bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:32:42
Correct, I bought $200 worth and now have $300
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:36:26
On a tip bot? I'm not 100% sure but you might still be able to access it if it was on reddit
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:44:04
Lower fees that way, just slower but that's the way I did it. Once you do that, try and move the money to GDAX. Incredibly low fees on buying or selling them.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:29:08
Let’s go! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:23:35
Are you trolling? It's insanely easy to buy and sell bitcoin for USD. I'm happy to explain how if you wanna be less combative haha.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:25:49
Siacoin maybe
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:47:39
Just bought in today at 6500! What luck lol 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:35:03
I'll never forget when I saw a reddit post from this sub celebrating breaking $250 for the first time. I tried to figure out how to start but gave up after a few minutes. Never gunna forgive myself for that, but at least I finally learned some shit and invested a few weeks ago at 5000.  
edit: To all the people DMing me and what not to learn about Bitcoin, I appreciate it but I don't have time to respond to everyone! 
The easiest way for you to get some bitcoin for yourself is simply to download the app 'Coinbase' and you literally just buy as much as you want on your debit card. That's not the ideal way to purchase bitcoin, all you really need to do is read this website. 
If you want to know the tech behind it, that'll take more reading and it'll never really make complete sense to you lol.
edit 2: 
edit 3: 
Let's say you wanted to buy and store a bitcoin - before I go on, it's important to stress **YOU CAN BUY FRACTIONS OF A BITCOIN**, it doesn't have to be a full 10k to start - your first step would be to setup a wallet. Search this subreddit to read their recommendations, there's even a [link]( on the sidebar for it. I personally use Electrum. If you google it, you'll probably be able to set it up pretty easily. From there, you'll have a bitcoin adress. It'll look something like this: 
1BAmLFekj8P6cM7nyYkb4sqFqsTdKo2Wk1 (one of mine)
With that adress, if you purchase any amount of BTC on a site like Coinbase(see above and use GDAX) you can then send your BTC to the adress that you'll see in your wallet to keep it safe. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:56:24
It's incredibly easy to lol 
Why have such a strong opinion about things you don't understand?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:05:47
haha I worded that wrong, I meant the two different coins I bought, XLM and BTC. God I wish I had enough money for 2 BTC lol.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:13:42
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:56:49
And now 9100! 
Congrats everybody! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:45:30
Youtube explains better than me, that's really what I did. It's very simple honestly.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:59:21
You’d get whatever the current price of bitcoin was - whatever fees the exchange you’re using has 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:17:41
Well I wrote a paper for my college writing class about it so I did a lot of research, wikipedia, this sub and the crypto sub, WSJ articles about it etc 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:25:59
lol what 
@_date: 2018-11-21 07:40:45
Yeah this is a paid post, mods delete
