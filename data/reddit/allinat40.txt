Just out of curiosity, was this sale done privately or did you unload on the exchanges and single-handedly cause the downturn over the last 48 hours?
@_date: 2014-06-13 12:56:41


That's a pretty big assumption of a core developer. There are several that are known to have have 5 figure quantites of BTC, I'm just not certain if Peter Todd is one of them.

Just get an off-lease laptop from [tigerdirect]( you can even buy it with bitcoin.

Actually no, Newegg clearly states that any refunds will be issued in the form of a gift card when you click the bitcoin payment option.

I just pointed out an effect I think may be contributing to the swings in my post over [here](
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:13:45
What we saw over the last two days was more related to human psychology than any change in the fundamentals. People see a parabolic chart and the media beats the "bubble" drum and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. 
The beauty of the Bitcoin protocol is that it stands on it's own regardless of the current exchange rate and the benefits it provides are apparent to anyone who takes the time to scrutinize it. This whole circus has drawn a lot of eyeballs to Bitcoin and I'm of the opinion that there is no such thing as bad publicity, after all the Winklevii don't seem too concerned.
I don't see this as a crash so much as a correction and I would not be surprised if we find ourselves retesting the highs in the not too distant future...
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:48:56
I agree about the speculators being quick to sell, but I think that this effect causes the price to drop down to peoples' "panic sell threshold" much faster that could happen in any legitimate way. 
We have had several *massive* corrections leading up to the "crash" but it was not until we had lag exceeding 15+ minutes that we dropped far enough and fast enough to trigger and actual panic chain reaction.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:49:45
It's already been done, look up Feathercoin. Such a joke.

I actually flipped a coin 256 times with heads/tails being 0/1 and converted the resulting binary string into hex to make an offline wallet with as much entropy as possible. 
Overkill? Maybe. 
Secure? Definitely.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:59:03
Literally **anything** would be better than the current lag situation.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:08:45
I disagree. We have had several big corrections previously but without the 15+ minute lag, buyers stepped in and the market recovered. Panic selling is driven by the price falling too far too fast. Inordinate amounts of lag virtually guarantee this will happen.
I'd be willing to bet that if you applied 45 minutes of lag to the NYSE during a downswing you'd have a similar crash of mammoth proportions because of the inability of buyers to react in time.
That's not to say there isn't less confidence in bitcoin from the speculators, just that I feel we broke that confidence for illegitimate reasons.

I've got my GPU's pointed at middlecoin.com.
It mines shitty altcoins, dumps them on the markets, and pays out btc. Helps keeps their value down and protects btc's position at the top of the food chain. You'll make way more than just straight mining btc with that low hash power.
@_date: 2013-10-09 23:22:54
What you are describing is a known feature of the bitcoin system which is referred to as "Colored Coins".
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:25:30
Hard forks are unavoidable as new features such as multiparty transactions, time delayed transactions, and colored coins are added to the protocol over time. Unplanned hard forks are a problem, deliberate hard forks not so much. In fact there is a hard fork already planned for May 15th to address the block transaction limit issues.
As for your argument that more decimal places = more currency I would have to fundamentally disagree.
$0.99 will buy you the exact same amount of dollar menu fries that $0.990000 will buy you. 
The extra decimals just open up the possibility of buying some reeeeallly tiny fries for $0.000001. Total scarcity of the resource we call bitcoin is unaffected, only its liquidity at the microscopic scale.

Because they haven't rolled out the new Midas engine yet, it's still in development.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:17:24
Yes, and they drag bitcoin through the mud in front of the whole world in the process.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:55:19
The floor is in @ 55, too much attention was gathered recently and there are too many people waiting on the sidelines to buy in for it to go down any further.
@_date: 2013-03-29 02:05:03
I laughed way too much at this.
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:33:09
Yes, as it stands today. However any entity with the resources to pull it off at the present difficulty is also going to be fairly slow moving. By the time they see bitcoin as a threat to their sovereignty and start considering a direct attack, ASIC's will be commonplace and the network will probably be 100 or 1000 times more powerful than it is today.
Personally, I've got pre-orders in with both Butterfly Labs and Avalon's batch 3 for the reason you mention and also as a hedge against a potential price crash and subsequent reduction in mining difficulty.
*edit: This only applies to small scale ASIC rigs. In the next 3 months GPU/FPGA's stand to be so massively outclassed that they will just waste electricity without really moving the difficulty needle, especially if BFL actually ships. I sincerely doubt there will be a serious threat to bitcoin in that timeframe, therefore I would not recommend buying any non-ASIC hardware for the sole purpose of mining at this point, even if it is just with the intention of protecting the network.

That assumes the alternate exchanges have the capacity to handle the load from Gox without having similar or worse issues. 
I don't think anyone would argue against the fact that lag amplifies sell offs, and having the primary exchange lag by over an hour during a sell off causes huge distortion in the fair market price on all the other exchanges due to arbitrage.
A lot of people got hurt by the "crash" and I don't think it would have been as nearly as bad if it were not for the impact that Gox lag has on the whole market.
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:44:05
Actually, 8 decimals isn't a hard limit as additional decimal places can be added by updating the protocol on an as needed basis. Also there is a strategy being discussed to make bitcoins infinitely divisible using a tonal number system, so for all intents and purposes, divisibility is not going to be in any way a limiting factor for BTC liquidity.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:42:23
Just go to [bitaddress.org]( and generate a paper wallet, then send your coins to that address.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:27:08
Yes, I think that the fact that the price held on at $85 today despite another 40 minutes of lag and the sell amplification it inflicted shows just how much the price floor has been raised. 
I believe that if the 1 hour 10 minute lag on Wednesday hadn't been there then we wouldn't have broken $175 and we would be at ~$200 right now.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:55:42
Yes, but my understanding is that every time you send coins, the full balance of your wallet is split into the amount you're sending and the rest as "change". 
The sent amount goes to the target address and the change comes back to a *different* address in your wallet. The bitcoin-qc client does this in the background using 100 pre-generated addresses but after 100 transactions it starts generating new addresses that may not be present in your backup.
This could result in you losing access to coins if your wallet.dat backup is older than your last 100 transactions.
There are plans to eliminate this risk using deterministic wallets but it is still a danger in the 0.8.1 client.

Bitstamp is doing almost no volume at that price.
MT Gox is still under DDOS and is intermittently available.
Bitcoin24 has been shut down due to their trade engine failure for over an hour.
We bounced off of $55 with massive support and the general consensus on the price right now is about $70
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:08:01
I'm simply saying that your assertion "the most a single whole bitcoin 1.00000000 can be worth would be 999,999.99$" is false. 
If things got to the point where 1 satoshi = 1 USD penny, it's not like you would hit a wall and it would be impossible to increase the value of BTC any further.
In the above scenario people would just begin demanding 10 pennies for every 9 satoshi traded and increase that ratio if the value on BTC kept going up.
This also completely ignores that fact that pennies are themselves divisible, just look at MtGox when you buy or sell. They use 5 decimals for USD prices.
Therefore my argument stands: there is no inherent numerical restriction on how high the value of a BTC can go as compared to USD.

True, I should have said even if all 5 major exchanges had equal traffic one "black hole" could pull all the others down significantly.

Actually CPU is not the bottleneck in the system. The devs have had 30K transactions per second running on a cheap dual core processor, no problem. The issue is the growth rate of the blockchain on people's hard drives coupled with the necessity of storing each transaction for the foreseeable future. Allowing extremely small transactions enables people to use the blockchain as a means to embed their own data for nearly free at the expense of everyone who runs a full node. 
The extra bandwidth required isn't much of an issue either, it would just slightly increase the orphaned block rate for miners with very slow connections.
I think the biggest problem with this idea is that any side blockchain that is compatible with the bitcoin protocol would be much smaller and therefore extremely vulnerable to a 51% attack given the hashing power available to asic owners right now.
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:37:03
That's only if you were handing someone physical pennies. The vast majority of USD to BTC transactions are digital and thus you would simply add decimals to the pennies when calculating a trade just like MtGox does. At no point does BTC value ever get limited by divisibility constraints.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:16:14
The problem is that it doesn't matter how many customers they have, it only takes one flawed exchange to lower the price across the board due to arbitrage.

I think he's pointing out that "irregardless" is not commonly viewed as a legitimate [word](
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:53:05
Yes, but I think the price would recover soon after and correct to a fair value. With Gox still active the price keeps getting beat down repeatedly causing the downward swings.
