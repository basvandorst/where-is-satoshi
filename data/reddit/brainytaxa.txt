I have been waiting for a discount like this to buy again. When everyone screams panic, I relish with thought of opportunity.

*Looks for guy with his hands down to steal the money from his cash out, then uses cash to buy more bitcoin.*

I'm just waiting for my investment to get past the million mark, then I'll diversify into traditional markets and realstate, but for now, I make enough money in my daytime to survive and watch the money I put in grow. Hopefully we'll be neighbors in the bitcoin citadels! 
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:24:49
I know, I simply meant diversifying between coins in crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:07:37
I bought at 700 in 2016, glad it never went back to that price once after I bought. Although pissed I didn't grab a shitload of etherium coins at 8 dollar at the same time.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:48:15
That's how I started, bought 90 bucks, and then 11.11 a check after that. This year I've been doing a different strategy thought, I wait for it to dip like now then throw a thousand dollars into the coin I have the least of so I'm diversified.

Hello mam, we are the bitcoin police, may we see the rest of your bitcoin so we can determine who took the other bitcoins? we will put it right back when our investigation is done.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:39:28
You're right, I meant relish
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:24:00
gawd dammit, was hoping to steal the last amount of bitcoin you had left.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:42:41
good on you, I'll see you when the price hits 1 million! Hope the regret of selling doesn't hit you to harsh then! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:43:11
You got to wait till the crash get's to it's absolute worse, then buy
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:32:43
You can shurly invest! You won't see a dicount like this ever again I tell you!
Edit: Ow I see, you were offering me to buy. If it's infront of 9 million buyers in a certain market I will surley invest!

I would like that alot. But damn the bay area I told myself I'd never live there because of how small the houses are, I live in LA. Houses are tiny too here but for 3.5 mill you can get a decent yard which is what I care about most. Well if all my investment works out well I should be able to retire by 2040 with about 10 mil, and if my uncle dies in jail I get unlimited supply of cash with his inheritance(We miss you tio chapo) so maybe by then I'll buy a vacation home up there when the time comes.
@_date: 2018-06-21 16:41:21
I'm guessing more if he slapped me to not sell at 10 mil, if he doesn't want me to cash out at 10 mill then where it goes too must be astronomical. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:09:44
Awe man I just asked that.
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:11:25
what if I told you, your right.
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:10:43
Me too but this guy aint explaining shit, he's just repeating the same thing like he's Sarah Sanders trying to push a narrative while dodging a question.
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:13:37
Just as we created it to be.
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:12:21
So put all my etherium into EOS? Roger that! Johnson! Johnson is the name of my trading bot.
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:10:55
Should I invest?
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:11:48
It's way to small and easy for one of the many sharks/whales out there to manipulate. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:58:33
Just like internet stocks were a scam in the early 90's because no one new how to use the internet in it's level of complexity back then. Only when it was made easy enough for the majority to use then was it realized not to be a scam. Guess well have to wait till all your neighbors to be using crypto for everyday purchases for you to know what I mean.
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:08:55
this will be big
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:09:21
Can Eck? Are they trustuble? 
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:12:56
You have just blown my mind Morphious.
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:09:06
how much will a btc be worth once this happens?
@_date: 2018-06-20 22:02:27
This is exactly what My future self told me when he came back in time to tell me to buy crypto.  Guy smacked me pretty fucking hard too till I promised not to sell, he made me promise not to sell even at 10 million. I personally don't trust the guy, but I'm afraid to disobey him incase he pops out of no where again to slap me silly.
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:36:18
I also did the math wrong. Reall number at 21 million would be 238 billion; 18 million coins would be 277 billion. I thought the protocol was for 21 million though? 
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:10:11
How would you know? What qualifications do you have that make you an expert? How much have you made on crypto? 
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:40:07
Wouldn't the money still divide amongst them since they technically still exist?
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:09:34
Is EOS a scam?
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:11:11
how solid of projects are we talkin about?
