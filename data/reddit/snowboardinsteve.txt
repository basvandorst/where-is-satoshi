But malicious users can always decide to act inefficiently. If there is not enough capacity to handle that then the system will be crippled whenever someone with deep enough pockets launches an attack...

Calling this spam is a rather pathetic excuse for a network that just can't keep up with demand.
Coinbase transactions are usage of Bitcoin as a currency. That is the whole point.
Sure, they may not be sending transactions in the most efficient way possible but in a permissionless network you will never get everyone to opt-in to following suggested best-practice, and the network has to be able to deal with that, or to enforce these best-practices in code.

This is from March 2010. Take a look for yourself at bitcoin.com from this time:
Looks completely unrelated to Satoshi's project to me.
It is also completely unrelated to the current Bitcoin.com, which is clearly a different website, as the domain name was sold in 2014.

What a fragile system if 100 people with pennies can break it. We are lucky if the worst problem we have is legitimate transactions executed in a poor way. What's going to happen when people intentionally flood the network? Bitcoin will be destroyed.

I agree, although I would further argue that peers can be crippled by high transaction fees (inability to participate in the network) and high mempool usage (mining centralisation).
I wouldn't say that Coinbase transactions are of little to no economic value, and certainly not the equivalent of spam emails. These are normal people buying and sending coins, which is a valid use case for Bitcoin and essential for an economy to function.

Not to be rude, but you got free money from the fork - you wasted money on the exchange.

The US has extensive relationships with many countries, forcing them to reveal financial information about US citizens. You will play "musical chairs" with your money for the rest of your life, moving the money around various anonymous offshore havens until finally you make a mistake, or the custodian is hacked, and you will probably lose everything in back taxes and penalties, possibly prison.
Captial gains tax is a price of being a US citizen and the benefits it provides (even if you are not currently using all benefits).
You have already won the game of life by acquiring more money than most will make in their lifetime, and to be honest, mining bitcoin did not take much effort. Just pay the taxes and be done with it.

That is for OTC trades, not centralised exchanges. With the latter you can't trade until the funds arrive at the exchange, usually with 6 conf.

The comments here are clearly biased. If you are actually interested I would recommend listening to interviews with Roger and make up your own mind. He has been on many podcasts recently.
The actual reason he gained the nickname is because he invested early in Bitcoin and pushed adoption by giving away Bitcoin to anyone who would take it, and investing in some of the first Bitcoin startups, notably Blockchain.info, BitPay, and Kraken. By the way he actually doesn't like the nickname, he says that he doesn't like how it ended for Jesus...

What is the purpose of that comment?

That was not a mechanism for **implementation**, that was a mechanism for establishing a scaling **proposal**.
The mechanism for implementation is how it has always been: all nodes (miners and users) will use whichever chain they want to, and the market will decide how much each chain is worth.

Yes and regardless of the optimism in this thread, the price can just as easily crash. How screwed would you be if your portfolio halved?
I think financial stability is an important first step before investing spare cash, even if you need to step out of your investment for a while.

POW change would require another hard fork right?
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:00:58
Yes, transactions can be spammed with 1 MB blocks as well but the chain will still only grow by a maximum of 1 MB per 10 minutes. For reference, a 1 TB HDD could store 19 years worth of 1 MB blocks.
Also remember that block size is inversely related to transaction fees. Smaller blocks means that everyone who wants to send bitcoin is competing for less and less space available in the chain and therefore will need to bid higher fees to "win" and get their transaction confirmed.
Regarding your second paragraph, you could be right, and there are people who feel strongly both ways. I would suggest to read the original bitcoin white paper (if you haven't already). That describes why bitcoin was created, and it was actually to be a global payment system.
With all the other cryptos there will for sure be some which function better as payment systems than bitcoin does now. But if there is another coin which works well as a payment system, it can also work well as a store of value, so what would actually be the point of Bitcoin then?

Goal achieved!

Yes I agree that what you are describing is feasible, and it would be a fun programming project (I know because I have written my own automated trading system).
I think you have already hit the nail on the head with scenarios where the strategy will actually lose you money. I prefer to avoid manual setting of prices and instead have dynamic prices which are calculated from the current or historical price.
Anyway, my point was that many people are running such scripts and they are all competing with eachother, to the point that it is extremely difficult to have a good shot at making a profit.
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:18:21
Well you are free to create that fork, but I would expect that transaction fees will be massive and therefore no one will use it.
Decentralisation is nice but if you can't send payments at reasonable cost then you have not created a currency.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:11:54
Yes any private wallet where you have the private key or seed phrase should be fine.
If you care about both coins then I would suggest not to make any transactions straight after the fork. Give it a couple of days to see how things play out. Then you can look up instructions for how to access your SW2X coin and move it safely to another address.

The trouble is that if Bitcoin becomes a global currency for payments, the number of transactions per block will need to increase by a factor of hundreds or thousands, so following Moore's law is probably not enough, at least from the current starting point of 1MB per 10 mins.
Monero has an interesting block size algorithm, however it is useful to remember that the block size was put in place to prevent spam (filling the Blockchain with millions of meaningless transactions). Monero is still vulnerable to spam transactions, it is just a slower process to fill up the Blockchain.
Another option is to vastly increase the block size, to say 1 GB and just accept that people running a full node will need to buy more storage and computing power. This makes it more costly to run a full node and therefore less people will be verifying blocks, making the network theoretically less secure and requiring more trust from average users in crypto businesses and miners.

Someone has to pay the transaction fees for opening and closing the channel

People have been running crypto trading scripts for years, since the first exchanges.
If you think it is possible to make money it is easy to test. Download historical price data and simulate your strategy.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:46:37
Correct. Miners are providing security to the network which is essential for bitcoin to be trusted as money. Developers are needed for growth of the network but that is of secondary importance. Bitcoin could continue with the current code forever and still be a store of value (fees would just price most people out of the network).

TIL "since the beginning" means when it was added via a soft fork about 7 years after the actual beginning.

Physical storage is not perfectly secure either.
It's about a balance between security, accessibility, and reliability.
