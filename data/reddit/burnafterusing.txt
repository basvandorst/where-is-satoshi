no, they absolved their debt for the hardware they purchased by converting the debt into shares(over market value)
FWIW The dividend was almost 100% more than it was last week.

thanks for your incredible insight, i was just asking him to clarify the parts of his sentence that didn't make sense to me.
@_date: 2014-06-29 02:29:35
yeah i'm not worried about it. i don't invest what i'm not willing to lose.

if only there was a subreddit devoted to bitcoinmining ( ) that had a [FAQ]( that would answer this question.

you should probably move the coins from this wallet. just saying someone else could take them and not return them.
@_date: 2014-03-19 05:12:40
good on the blockchain for being so transparent. I'll admit i use their webwallet and was easily able to import my keys/wallet with multibit. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 06:00:59
you can't

western union


opening a bank account is a choice. there are many banks to choose from.


It's called a Deposit Agreement. And why wouldn't you want to know what your bank is doing with your money and what kind of fees or restrictions may or may not apply to your account. 
They also are required to notify you of any changes in the policy. So "stay up to date on everything" is as simple as opening your mail/email.
@_date: 2014-03-18 19:13:28
no need for an apology i just was trying to understand what you were asking so i could try and answer your question/help you.
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:52:54
where did you buy this?
@_date: 2014-07-06 04:42:19
Nice, i'll be in richmond september 16th.

There is no more payment. the debt has been converted to those shares and presumably the shares have been transferred to whomever the debt was owed to(cryptX).
@_date: 2014-07-05 06:44:42
it's been one week since they announced 
|We are currently working on a solution for this and we will switch to p2pool as soon as we are able to fix this problem.

even better it looks like this place is 1.2 miles from the club we'll be at.

This is a chase policy. Every bank i have an account with my funds are available immediately at the time of deposit. 
I love bitcoin as much as the next guy, but this post is mediocre at best.

@_date: 2014-07-12 23:03:21
My point is you chose to have this policy effect your money by maintaining an account with chase.  
Join a credit union or one of the hundreds of banks that doesn't hold your funds hostage.

The title of the vehicle has the sellers name and you ask to see their ID. Pretty simple stuff.

I am well aware. 
Even with the increase from 50% to 100% the dividend could have been less than a true 100% increase, as in less coins were mined in the week. 
But this was not the case they mined(after paying the hosting fee) 170~ BTC last week and ~173 this week. If they had mined &lt; 170 BTC the dividend payout this week would have been less than a 100% increase.
@_date: 2014-04-06 04:11:30
just reached this balance today.
@_date: 2014-07-12 00:20:49
They may in the future by having a vote. As for now, no. 100% payout daily.
@_date: 2014-03-20 00:48:55
or google authenticator which is a much better app IMO

teespring garbage.

this is great for shares at .02~ not so much for the shares i bought at .046~ 12 days ago.
@_date: 2014-07-31 04:29:22
i believe your first purchase always takes the 4-5 days, at least for me and the three or more people i've set up with coinbase that has been the case.
@_date: 2014-03-19 04:18:12


@_date: 2014-07-31 19:49:03
coinbase =/= bitcoin.
