"when I was in 8th grade a friend told me about Bitcoin, so I started mining them.".. yeah that's how most people start mining... in Minecraft

Can someone Explain to me what is a FIAT currency? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:42:23
ya kraken is shit.. so as coinbase if you're in canada.. I'm pretty happy with coinsquare sofar.. just make sure you have funds to use for days like this.. since interac e-transfers take some time to process.. I wish TD allowed interac online transactions :(

I just bought my first $1000CAD worth of bitcoin today! I've been waiting for this day since a month now! Yay! Might put another $500 if it keeps going down by 7pm when I get home

Thank you! and Yes! Hardware wallet 
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:00:11
Thank you! TBH I'm amazed how quick I was able to accomplish this milestone. The fact that I made my first move made it feel suddenly so real! and since then it made me realize how many things I used to throw my money in aren't that necessary: ordering food when I'm lazy versus cooking, driving to work when I can walk or use the public transit, drink less, etc. I feel like it even got a positive effect on my health and wellness...
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:31:14
PMed you :)
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:41:23
Ugh... I'm really sorry guys.. but as much as I'm really excited to join the Bitcoin community, invest and learn.. it feels like that after all the reading and trying to understand... if you're not in the US everything is different and hard to deal with.. :( Please any insight is welcome!

I HODL  Because I rather save money in my BTC wallet than my bank acount
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:29:51
I see Quadriga CX on all my Google searches but I find it confusing.. do you mind elaborating about it?
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:48:28
Thank you! Now I need to make sure he doesn't feel alone!

A documentary about Silk Road in 2013... I wish I bought BTC back then.. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:37:01
I created an account with Quadriga but I don't find it easy to use.. I mean now that my account is verified.. I dunno how to quickly fund my account... 
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:29:50
Thank you! and YES! I'm HODLing the hell of my Precioussss! :)

3 Months! But I've been lucky that all these dips kept on happening!

Where do you get your flexepin if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:46:34
Amazing! You're about to reach that awesome milestone! :D 
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:33:39
I find it hard to fund your account.. (Takes ages before the funds get in your dashboard) also I feel the fees from quick sell/buy are weird.. Every time I refresh my page the quote changes a lot)

@_date: 2018-02-10 01:08:46
Scrolled thinking this comment would be all over the thread.. surprised this is the only one as of now
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:21:29
Amazing! No more Email Money transfert 24 delay! :)

I'd love to watch south American guys looking for un buen rabo in Spain then lol
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:18:50
Damn!... I was about to press the "Make this trade" button when my 0.2 bitcoins would've gave me a $3000CAD at my lunch break.. So I can rebuy now.. oh well..
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:33:43
Thanks! It's been 3 months of cutting the fluff in my expenses... I feel like if I didn't put that money on BTC I'm not sure I'd still have half of it now... Best decision I've made this 2018
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:58:35
I put a $1000CAD.. a month ago for the first time while knowing about BTC for the past 3 years and hating myself for not doing it earlier.. hey... The best time to start is yesterday.. the other best time is today! :)
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:45:46
Care to elaborate about your experience with it? and how did you get around it? I find it hard to understand.. is there any tutorial/tip that helped you? I'd appreciate any advice!
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:03:54
Yeah but the options offered to fund with CAD are very limited.. The only one I thought would be my option [Interac Online]( doesn't work because my Bank (TD) won't allow it...
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:37:37
gotta admit that the fees are higher than a regular online exchange wallet such as Quadriga or coinbase but the fact that I can use it for instant cash is pretty convenient.. and I only go for it in case of emergency cash need (like small amounts for a quick fix)
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:53:58
I actually feel like the btc price has been pretty steady for the past month or so.. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 01:23:52
they charge 6.5% per transaction with a shadowy btc market value tbh.. but as I said .. in case of emergency that's the best option.. at least in here (Toronto)
@_date: 2018-04-08 01:27:31
totally agree .. but i only used this for emergency.. when I was running low in cash
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:44:01
Thank you for your answer! I am planning on buying bitcoins but not selling anytime soon.. just wanted to know if the day comes that I want to sell via coinbase I can.. hopefully that day comes after they re open to Canada..
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:12:46
U/Tyburgess you are amazing!!!! Thank you sooo much for your input! I really appreciate your feedback! I just got the Breadwallet app. Now i'm reading the r/bitcoin feed and it seems like everyone is freaking out about coinbase and aug1st.. whats going on?
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:23:16
I've been doing some research and found a site called Kraken. is it any good?
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:14:41
Care to elaborate?
