The most important thing to keep in mind here is the notion that this article comes from a credible 'analyst'. SeekingAlpha is notorious for being a repository of all kinds of psycho-babble relating to just about anything financial. Heck, they have even approached me multiple times to be a contributor, when all I have done is point out various misconceptions and fallacies. I have had excessively critical comments removed. The community is older and generally crypto-hating. So be very cautious about taking this article seriously.

If you scroll down the page, you'll see there are longer, trailer interviews with each one of the participants.  Viewing these requires a $29 annual subscription to SQ1.tv.  The subscription can be paid with a credit card and yes -- Bitcoin!  I'm not interested enough to sign up for an annual subscription, but I would have gladly watched individual trailers for a micro-transaction fee. Strange that SQ1 didn't consider this option as Bitcoin micro-transactions were discussed at some length in the documentary.

I have been acquiring Bitcoins continuously since spring 2011.  I have a decent stash now and don't mind spending a small portion of them.  My primary goal is, however, to hold for the long term.
I spend Bitcoin on the following, in no particular order: i) acquiring what I think are promising altcoins, ii) giving some BTC as presents to friends/family, iii) buying merchandise at Overstock.com.

Experimental indeed.  It would be wise to look at some of the well-thought criticisms of the concept (links below).  I wouldn't invest until you thoroughly convince yourself that you understand how it's supposed to work.

It's mostly a puff piece.  Bitshares makes some important, untested assumptions about collective human behavior. These are assumptions upon which the entire model CRITICALLY depends.  The developers even concede that it's an experiment.  I'd advise anyone who is contemplating getting into this to carefully review what is being proposed and how it is supposed to work.  Convince yourself you truly understand it before accepting the claim that it will replace Bitcoin.

How will your system be different than Bitshares?

If you are interested in an amount that is smaller than 25 euros, just use localbitcoins.com

I have had very good service with justcoin.com in Norway.  A SEPA transfer will process in 2-3 business days and the prices are essentially the same as on the bigger exchanges.

Peter Schiff is indeed wrong and actually has a history of being wrong. Very wrong:
His relentless Bitcoin bashing is just theater, for entertainment purposes only. He is too smart to truly believe what he is saying.  No doubt he enjoys the attention.

I understand your argument, but to be fair the WWW is an API built for the Internet.  The foundation for that was laid in the 1960's.

The Winklevii own an estimated 1 percent of all Bitcoin. Do you think Zuckerberg would do anything to assist its adoption, given his history with the twins?

Their ads are plastered inside of just about every car in the Chicago subway. But this might be appealing to those who are aware of or experienced exchange fiascos like Mt Gox.

Having dabbled in sports betting over many, many years, there is one rule I have found to work exceptionally well:
"When you are absolutely convinced that you have found the dead-lock, certain, can't-lose wager  ...  Bet the exact opposite."

During the primaries, I inquired via email whether her campaign would accept Bitcoin donations. I never got a reply.
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:55:06
She was my most preferred candidate by far.

Doesn’t matter. As long as you have the seed, you can regenerate it with any deterministic wallet including Electrum.

Bitcoin might be worth a fortune in that scenario, but would you really want to live in a place that had been wrecked by socialism? Exhibit A: Venezuela

There is a lot of truth to this. A good place to gauge the sentiment of financially astute Boomer retirees (of which I am one) is SeekingAlpha.com. Discussion of Bitcoin started ramping up around 2013 and it was almost universally ridiculed. Comments mentioning Ponzi, tulips, Beanie Babies, hacking, no inherent value, etc were ubiquitous. The needle hasn’t moved much in the past 5 years. As people age, they generally become resistant to ideas, concepts, technology that challenge long-held beliefs. Patient, reasoned, persuasive arguments presented to such folks are essentially futile. Peter Schiff is emblematic of this mindset. But that’s OK as this is the expected if not necessary reaction to the appearance of disruptive new technology.

I also learned about it in May 2011 while in Germany.  I studied it for a couple of weeks, then decided I wanted some.  What people don't generally appreciate when looking back at that time is how INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT it was to acquire.  If I could have bought privately and with confidence, there is no doubt I would have bought a lot.  But Mt Gox was already sketchy and a large bank transfer could have attracted scrutiny.  It was a much bigger risk at the time compared to today.

I guess I kinda.....like 'em all.
