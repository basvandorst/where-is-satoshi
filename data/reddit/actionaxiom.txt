Too true. Some people are simply too daft to have actually read Mises and understand that *intrinsic value* is not the same thing as *intrinsically valuable*, where Mises himself said that the origins of money lie in a good's intrinsic value. I wouldn't put it past bitcoiners to continue to butcher the ideas of marginalism to fit their pretend money fad.
@_date: 2014-01-16 05:03:16


Yeah except for the whole *intrinsic use* thing. Good to see Ron Paul is ok with completely ignoring his supposed Austrian perspective when it comes to bitcoin.

if bitcoin is backed by electricity I should be able to use it as electricity or redeem it for credits at my local power plant. But I can't because it's not backed by electricity.

Without legal tender status codified in tax law the long term value of dollar denominated assets would be zero. Are you saying that if nobody was required to pay the government in federal receipts people would still value them long term?
Also your bit about scarcity determining value is cute, but sadly not at all a reflection of real economic phenomena.
Maybe you should go watch Hoppe's seminar on how fiat money originates.

Avoid ubuntu like the plague. If you're new, try Manjaro.
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:21:11


Convert it? To what?


Backing means redeemable in some good or another. Bitcoin is not backed by electricity because you can't turn it into electricity or redeem it.

This sub is full of enough bullshit we don't need to start pushing bankrupt ideas on economic regularity. There is no categorical reason for human psychology to dictate cyclic movements in prices. It may be the case in certain instances, but systemic movements in real asset prices (not make believe money with no real scarcity) is not psychological, it is structural, and has everything to do with increases in credit bidding up toxic investments.

So bitcoin prices are really proxy dollar prices?
Wow how can people on this sub think bitcoin is going to be the next money if they don't expect people to do actual economic calculation in bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:56:15


Why does this make sense? Money systems emerge from barter transactions. Prices denominated as money historically evolve from an intrinsic (industrial, non-monetary) value. How will bitcoin emerge as a money system if people using it are really using it to proxy dollar calculation and not bartering with it?
In other words, if bitcoin prices are really just dollar prices, nobody is doing economic calculation with bitcoin. What would cause people to prefer doing economic calculation with bitcoin when the people they are trading goods to don't even do that.


That's a big if. If people are only valuing bitcoin because it has a dollar price, that means they are just using bitcoins as a vehicle for dollar calculation. When the next recession happens people who are cash poor will dump their bitcoins because they never actually wanted bitcoins to begin with.

Of course the flawed notion that a decline in total revenues causes lower rates of economic growth would be touted on a sub pursuing the creation of money assets through mania.


But you should be spending that. Maybe inflation in the alt-chain at ~10% would get you off your ass.

Not at all. Store of value is a secondary function of money.

Debian is not rolling release which sucks if you want to control how current your software is. While i would urge everyone to give xfce with xmonad a try, because it has a much smaller resource footprint than most of the other environments out there and tiled WMs are much better for productivity, you can run standard metacity gnome on virtually any distro.

No, he used the monetary base, which is the amount of vault currency plus reserve currency in banking institutions. Obviously this is incorrect since it doesn't include outstanding currency. The M2 only includes liquid deposits. For a much better and more correct scope of money supply look at the Autrian TMS ([here is the justification](

History question: What paradox was Mises trying to answer with the formulation of the regression theorem?

hell yeah. Blind speculation always pays off buddy.
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:17:57
Close. It had to do with *value*. People *valuing* money seemed to be a historic paradox. We see money has value, but it is only valued because it represents future exchanged goods to the purchaser of money. Why would something have exchange value in the first place just to be exchanged in the future? The answer is that no good can spontaneously become a monetary good. That is why government fiat cannot be money without the state imposing a monopoly on the production and supply of money and requiring its use through taxation. It is also why goods with no value as a commodity cannot serve as money.
But maybe when Aunt Betty collects her husband's life insurance windfall in bitcoins we can talk about bitcoin being money and begin to question where Mises made an error in reasoning.

The depreciating value is a direct result of people losing trust in US dollars. But dollars do serve an economic purpose beyond mere trust. They are backed by the full judicial force of US tax code. If you do not exchange some percentage of your wealth every year for dollars to give to the government, you go to jail.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:37:35
yes of course. What does that have to do with bitcoin being backed by electricity?
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:18:17


This is pricing. Pricing something in a currency is not the same thing as backing it with that good. Prices change, redeemability does not.


That is a non-sequitur.


No. The reason for a backing is so that a money substitute can be used freely as the good it is substituting and without risk or with very little risk. When people exchange bank receipts, they are in fact trading ownership of the very thing the receipt is backed by. The receipt only serves to facilitate trading in a way that the good cannot intrinsically supply (i.e. portability).


No, not at all.


I dont know how I can make this any clearer. Prices and redeemability are different things. Just because something can be priced in a currency does not mean that currency now backed by it.


Sound currency, by definition, is not volatile.


Sure, and probably negatively, since to use the payment network requires an electrically driven interface, if it becomes much more expensive to use bitcoins over USD very few people will use it.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:30:27


No, it's emphasizing the semantic distinction between *direct* and *indirect*.


Sure. Regardless, it's inconsequential.

Except things like namecoin have actual intrinsic functionality whereas bitcoin can only be used as finite ledger space. The only reason people value it over alt-chains is because of current market consensus.

Can I use a bitcoin to power my house?
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:18:18


But we already established I can't go to the power plant and convert it to credits. 
Now before you object and say that there may be some power plant in the future that accepts payments in bitcoin, understand this is NOT redeemability or backing. Things that are backed are not subject to price variance. Redeemability exists outside of exchange rates.


No idea what you're saying here.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:39:32


which isn't meaningful.


Not really:


debt denominated in what?


No it's not. Direct means exactly that, direct payment. When the government issues bonds, dollar holders do not have to pay the government. Their dollars are devalued long term and this reduction in wealth can be considered a tax, but there is nothing direct about this.
