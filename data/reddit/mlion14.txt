If you knew what was involved in a PCI audit you wouldn't think it was pedantic.  Also, I pointed out that Braintree WILL support bitcoin, so nothing in their "business model" is stopping them.

Actually, Uber probably doesn't store CC info on their own servers. This would open them up to a huge PCI audit.  Instead they use Braintree to store cards and process the payments.  Braintree and Card.io (which Uber uses to allow you to scan cards) are actually both owned by PayPal.  The good news is that Braintree (as are many payment gateways)[ are working to support Bitcoin](  The real reason he was reluctant is because his payment vendor doesn't fully support bitcoin yet AND there isn't enough market pressure from users asking for it to put the pressure on Paypal.

Just because the cars are nicer doesn't mean the drivers carry commercial insurance to cover you in an accident. I'm a huge Uber fan, but there is a lot of grey area.  The drivers aren't even employees of Uber.  It's amazing that a traffic accident fatality hasn't occurred yet.  It's only a matter of time.  When that happens (because all driving is inherently dangerous, expect a nasty public lawsuit.

Yeah, the Braintree aspect is the most promising. Uber uses Braintree as a gateway and Braintree has been advertising all over the U.S. That they are the vendor that allows for ANY type of payment (Bitcoin particularly). All uber would need to do is tweak the UI and they could accept Bitcoin overnight.

This should explain a little. 
Also they still have gateways in Europe. It's not just an American invention.

"Month"  They are talking about the decline during the month of January.  It's also a reference to Disney movie "[Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day](

To tell you the truth, I'm not super technical.  I usually offer my standard answer: the forms are hosted by our servers and we use varying levels of encryption.   From our security page though: (more detail) 


New encryption keys are generated on a daily basis, existing keys are rotated on a regular basis.
Sensitive information is encrypted by an SSL connection when in transit over public networks.
SSL connections are limited to TLSv1, TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2.
Recurly adheres to the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for Service Providers.
and 


Private networks are strictly segmented according to function. Restrictive firewalls protect communication entering the network and between private networks.
All access to Recurly's network and services is strictly logged. Audit logs are reviewed on a regular basis.
Internal and external network penetration tests are performed on a regular basis by third-parties.
 
Two-factor authentication and strong password controls are required for administrative access.

Great question.  Twitch uses a Recurly (my company) Javascript form to capture CC info and that is sent to us.  They then get back a token and never see sensitive CC info. This allows them to not have to deal with PCI (Payment Card Industry) standards of security which are onerous.  My company does it as an outsourced vendor and we do it for a lot of big name SaaS companies.  Documentation   You can even read the Twitch case study here

I work for the company that powers Twitch's billing. They do not store CC info on their servers. We were not hacked and therefore no cc info was stolen. Sensationalist title is sensationalist.
