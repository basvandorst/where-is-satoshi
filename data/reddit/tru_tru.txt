Buffett is the anti-murdoch. Buffett is hands off on all his investments. He bets on management and then sits the fuck back. Micromanaging is for morons. Good managers know how to get the right people for the job and then stand back. If it all goes to shit, then you step in and change management, then step away again. This is why buffett is king. Don't ever tell someone how to do their job. If you need to direct someone at their own job, then you need to replace them and get an independent thinker who knows their shit.

The problem with all these predictions going to $100,000 are that, as an investor I would like to wait till we hit $4-5000 before I really believe it. So I am not going to invest until we past at least $3000+, then I will know this is a winner.

You are right. Five years on, its obvious that Bitcoin is not going to be adopted by the masses. Google/facebook/twitter...all took less than a year for a majority of internet users to adopt. If btc had the grand utility that its proponents say it does, more than 0.01% of internet users would already be using it.

what is private about the transmission of fiat to-and-from an exchange? You have zero privacy when it comes to the banking industry. When you place funds in, or take funds out of an exchange, a bank record is created. You will never get around this.

Then it will be jealousy that prevents btc from going mainstream. It doesn't matter what you call it, its a big fat NO from the mainstream. Five years on, bitcoin has not managed to acquire even 1% of internet users nor 1% of the money transfer market. Five years in tech-time is like 45 years.

you still need a bank to get those btc into cash and that will most certainly trigger laundering warnings and now you will be double triple fucked when caught red handed skirting tax laws. BTC is great for playing keepaway from authorities...until you decide that you want to convert to fiat and then the game is over. Let's be real about that.

The vast majority of merchants ARE ignoring btc and you cannot make them accept it. If I got a blast of phone calls at my work with people pushing us into bitcoin, I would ignore it out of principle. 
Technology either finds its market or it doesn't. Trying to sell people on new tech is the surest way to identify technology that is bound to fail. Technology that brings significant utility (google/facebook/twitter/reddit...) sells itself. Look at all the greats...there was ZERO marketing done to get to the top. They simple brought tech that had massive utility and people could see this on their own. Bitcoin, here we are five years on and I am willing to bet that it is a permament failure due to BTCs inability to capture even 1% of the money transfer market or 1% of internet users. Its a fail. I don't give a shit how much VC money is being thrown down. 9 out of 10 VC funded projects die on the vine.
@_date: 2014-05-14 21:18:41
I like how you are being downvoted so hard for simply telling it like it is. BTC offers no real utility over all current payment methods. The only thing btc offers is the dream of getting rich for taking a extreme financial risk.  And the fact that the only usd exchanges are in slovenia and bulgaria? If btc was legit, there would be exchanges all over the U.S. and Canada yet  there are ZERO exchanges in north america. ZERO exchanges that are within the borders of the american legal system...americans will never ever adopt bitcoin because of this.

If they don't have access to financial services, then btc is of no use as the user cannot withdraw to fiat so they will be stuck having to spend btc within the teeny tiny market of merchants that accept it.
