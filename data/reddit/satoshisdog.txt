Basically, when you trade crypto A for crypto B, pretend you sold crypto A for the current USD price and bought that amount of crypto B. So suppose you bought one Bitcoin at 10K. Then when it reached 11K you traded it for Litecoin. You owe taxes on the 1K that you made. And 11K becomes your cost basis for your LTC.

Governments don't have a choice in the matter. That's the point.
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:31:38
Yeah. Hopefully someday crypto will replace fiat and we won't have to worry about it.

Capital gains tax too unfortunately: 
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:21:13
Technically you still owe taxes on your BTC gains when you buy things.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:49:47
I'll think about being concerned after I see the charts do something I haven't seen 50 times. For example, I would be a little worried if we see 8K again.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:54:29
You should switch your chart to logarithmic. Linear scale charts are misleading since percentage of gains/losses is what actually matters -- not raw values.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:08:10
That's why cold storage -- paper wallets, hardware wallets, etc exist. 
You wouldn't carry millions of dollars in cash around with you.

Precious metals ETF's collapse because of this from time to time.
Yet another reason to hold your own coins.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:51:31
No, percent change is the only thing that matters, which is why you should only look at logarithmic charts. Imagine you invest 10K into a $1 stock and 10K into a $1,000 stock. The $1 stock goes up 100% to $2 and you now have 20K. The $1000 stock goes up 1% to $1001 and you now have $10,010. Looking at it in terms of dollars, both stocks performed the same. Why do you think the entire financial industry discusses price in percentages?

You can also use lightning from a hot wallet like  which doesn't require any technical knowledge. However, you shouldn't keep much BTC in it for security reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:27:47
Nah. I measure dips by how many weeks/months/years of growth they reverse. 
We crossed 5K for the first time ever in October and 10K for the first time ever at the end of November. Seeing 10K again doesn't upset me.

They will still need to close the shorts eventually -- which requires buying back the coins they borrowed. My contingency plan, if this happens, is to buy up the cheap coins and refuse to sell. Then when the price goes up and all the shorts get closed, the price will skyrocket.
I'd say at worst, we get crazy volatility. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:56:02
This would be more appropriate if the price was $1-2K or lower. You don't stay in crypto very long if losing a few months of gains bothers you.

Coinbase has a vault and is launching "Coinbase Custody", storing Bitcoin for institutions as a paid service. Also, a bank in South Korea seems to be doing it for individuals: 
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:30:05
We can't keep Wall Street out of Bitcoin. Bitcoin needs to be strong enough to weather whatever financial institutions and governments throw at it.
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:37:36
I've always thought deflation meant "an increase in buying power" which is certainly the goal of all investing. I guess there is no way of knowing if that would happen in a crypto-based economy. It has been true over the long term so far. 
My original point is that people have a very bad habit of spending their money on things they don't need instead of investing it. Given this habit, it seems unlikely that they would stop spending money just because the buying power of their money is increasing slightly over time.
It seems more likely that deflationary spirals are caused by fear of economic collapse rather than the hope that prices will continue to fall and allow purchasing more goods later.
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:57:36
The value of a currency comes from being able to spend it, yes. But if everyone wants to spend currency and no one wants to hold it, it will be like a game of hot potato and you'll have runaway inflation. There are billions of dollars sitting around in bank accounts because people are comfortable holding dollars -- despite the gradual erosion of purchasing power. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:58:34
It's a big "if", I admit. But it cannot become mainstream without enormous gains.
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:25:24


I would do an inflation adjustment to see if I had actually made money or not. I do that with all my investments. I would phrase it as "appreciation" though. 


Technically, the rate of inflation would decrease over time as the newly minted coins would be a smaller percentage of the total supply every time. And then every four years it will be cut in half. That's just a nitpick though. Fair point unless people hoard more and more Bitcoin or lose it at a higher rate than inflation.


Do you consider precious metals, bottles of wine and other commodities to not be investments? What about real estate -- assuming that it sits empty instead of being rented out or used.


I'm getting out of my depth here, but aren't there economists who disagree with that in the Austrian school of economics? Regardless, if Bitcoin turns out to be inflationary, we won't have to worry about it.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:51:41
Very true. The stock market has been deflationary for centuries, so why doesn't everyone invest all their money in stocks instead of spending it? Oh right, because they need/want to buy things.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:23:56
If everyone followed the rule of only investing what they could afford to lose, there really is no reason to panic. 
I'm not going to sell. Crypto is my moonshot. If it pays off, great. If not, at least I had fun.

Unless you spend your entire pay check, you have to park your extra money some place. Standard advice in traditional markets is to invest your money and plan to leave it for at least a decade.

They're unavoidable at these prices regardless of adoption and liquidity.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:02:59
"Actual" currencies have HUGE market caps in addition to their adoption. Bitcoin is so tiny that small fluctuations in adoption, usage or speculation move the price all over the place.
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:10:16
Very true. A volatile market is an interesting one.

It's things like this that drive home just how powerful decentralized systems are. Should we have a global, immutable datastore that anyone can add random data to? Doesn't matter -- we already have it. Should we delete bad content from it? Doesn't matter -- we can't.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:57:51
You said it was being taxed to oblivion, which is false. It's being taxed the way everything else is. Why would anyone expect anything else?

It's an uncorrelated asset.

It's well known that people don't save enough money for retirement.

I think he is arguing that stocks are better than cryptocurrency. Not really a meaningful comparison since they aren't competitors.
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:49:31
We've known about this for 5 years. Why it suddenly "emerged" again is anyone's guess. One of the consequences of giving people freedom and power -- such as access to an immutable datastore -- is that some of them will use it for evil. End of story. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:48:09


Completely false. The government controls the supply (through issuance and open market operations) AND regulates the entire banking system. Even if all crypto exchanges colluded they would not have that much power.
That said, using decentralized exchanges like Bisq would be much better. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:05:07
Volatility and price swings are not part of Bitcoin, they are a result of it being brand new. Volatility is unavoidable at this tiny market cap. If Bitcoin ever succeeds in becoming mainstream it will need to be at least 300K per coin so we have a lot of market swings ahead before it can ever stabilize. 
Scaling is a serious problem, but it is being worked on. 
The problems that is solves are:
1. You can store your own money digitally. No need to trust anyone else.
2. You can send and receive money over the internet without payment systems.
3. You can depend on the current set of rules holding true forever.
4. Governments are evil and have a tendency to break things. Every government will collapse, it's just a matter of time.

What does "legal tender" matter to a consumer?
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:10:32
I started by buying $10 per week. It's definitely fun and you can still make a decent amount of money. You can bypass fees by using maker transactions on GDAX, (simpler than it sounds).
In fact, I would recommend that everyone start out by making very small buys. It gets you involved in the market and shows you what sort of volatility you'll be dealing with if you decide to make a larger investment.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:13:18
That's true, but I doubt that has nearly as much impact as the desire to buy things. I know many people who have a 401k through their employer but hardly put anything in it. They always have a brand new car though.
Why would deflationary currency be different?
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:54:26
Feels fine. Short term price movements (anything smaller than a decade) don't matter. Also I'm still at a profit.
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:53:59
Right. Which could include 2-5% Crypto, for example. Such a person could still be called a HODLer. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:58:05
As much as I'd like to celebrate, I'll wait till I see 10K again before I get my hopes up.
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:54:59
True. Probably the ones with higher electricity rates and older hardware.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:51:06
Not sure I understand. It's taxed the same as everything else -- capital gains when you sell at a profit.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:02:49
I don't know of any psychologically significant levels between 7K and 5K, so I wouldn't bet on it. (This crash is all about psychology since none of the fundamentals have changed. South Korea, China and credit cards are complete non-issues.)
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:36:33
Why do you have a problem with HODLing? Standard investment advice in traditional markets is to make an allocation plan and stick to it for a long period of time -- usually at least a decade. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:15:59
I'm not sure I understand your point. What are you calling nonsense? Technical analysis?
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:04:58
Not if the difficulty adjusts downward. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:14:15
Standard advice in traditional markets is to invest your money in a diversified portfolio then forget about it for multiple decades, other than periodic rebalancing. This is the exact same thing as HODLing. If, after researching the fundamentals, someone believes that Bitcoin will rise over the next decade, buying and holding is the correct strategy.
