The natural order of things is deflationary i.e. things get more efficient and it costs less money to produce more.
What if they keep inflating the currency because we're on the brink of natural abundance?
@_date: 2016-04-07 08:08:51
Sure.  Then the majority hash power has spoken, and users would likely leave bitcoin, because that's the new Bitcoin by definition.  Hence why the miners would never do that :)
@_date: 2016-04-07 19:25:46
The vast majority of users and auditors do not support a 1 MB block size.  And yet the majority hash power still does.  Thus, the Bitcoin network is limited to 1MB block size.
The majority hash power sets the literal rules that are physically implemented, no exception.
@_date: 2016-04-07 11:32:52
Oh no!  Don't let majority rule, we can't have that, they'll steal all your money!
Trust in a dictatorship instead, we'll take care of you ;)
@_date: 2016-04-08 15:21:51
Valid blocks are defined by what the network accepts, which are enforced by miners.  Is that unclear?
@_date: 2016-04-07 07:49:31
Consensus is the longest chain, which is determined by majority hash power :)
Read the white paper.
@_date: 2016-04-07 07:18:21
Of course not.  But that's a ridiculous scenario which would never happen.
Majority hash power wins, period.  Welcome to Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-04-08 02:14:08
Fortunately, I agree with you.  Bitcoin isn't a dictatorship, and it will find a way around the small group of developers who refuse to negotiate with what the vast majority of the community wants.

You say consensus is determined by the economic majority, and that the economic majority is represented by economically dependent fully validating auditors of the blockchain (aka miners).  Ok, so consensus is determined by miners.  Great, I agree with you.
You're welcome to the veer from the "unfortunate implicit assumptions" of the Bitcoin whitepaper.  Altcoins are great for that.  I'll stick with Bitcoin, as originally envisioned by its creator.

@_date: 2016-04-07 07:42:56
If they change the rules, and mine a new longest chain, then that chain is the valid chain by definition.
@_date: 2016-04-08 02:10:19
Ok, whitepaper:
"The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.   As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network,  they'll  generate the longest  chain  and  outpace attackers."
"If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains."
"Nodes  always consider   the   longest   chain   to   be   the   correct one  and will keep   working   on
extending it."
"They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.  Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."

100 years is a cosmic blink of the eye.  100 years is 0.1428% of the 70,000 years modern humans (like you and I) have inhabited the earth.  It's not a good scale for history.

I listened to an interview with Ross's mother last night.  Among other things, these points make me believe the process lacked integrity:
- The sentencing for Ross's offenses is life in prison, no parole, in a maximum security federal prison (where the bad shit happens).  Compare with rapists who get 8 years.   It is disproportionate to the crime.
- The pertinent information surrounding the corrupt government officials' involvement was disallowed from the trial completely.
- Ross was explicitly not allowed to turn around and acknowledge his family, who was present for the proceedings.
- Ross's political beliefs were not allowed to be heard.  Ross's worldview underpinned his actions, and most would agree this was an inherently political issue.
- The possibility of multiple DPRs was not allowed.
- The marketplace itself was mischaracterized.  Although marijuana was by far the most frequently traded substance, this was barely mentioned.  Most depictions were of the substances with the most potential for abuse.
In my humble opinion, this process reeks of corruption.
Edit: Ross was indicted on attempted murder charges.  Indictments require no evidence and can be based on heresy.  No charges were filed and this did not enter the trial.  If I wanted to tarnish a character for the masses without substantiating the claims, this is how I'd do it.

The more fundamental problem is there is more sell pressure than buy pressure.  This involves inflation and demand. Demand is related to usefulness and size of its user base.  Usefulness will increase as the ecosystem matures.  The user base will also increase as tools become easier to use.
Keep in mind it's not as useful in the developed world with modern banking infrastructure.  You might see relatively more adoption in undeveloped regions who will largely skip traditional banking.

If you just want to receive btc, use a real wallet app that doesn't invade your identity.  I recommend Copay.  No sign-up, open source, etc.
Then give the sender your bitcoin receive address from the app and they can push btc to you.
If you want to buy bitcoin, Coinbase and Circle can help by linking to your bank account, but they will intrude on your privacy.  It also takes several days for transactions to complete.  Localbitcoins.com can help you buy person to person.

Admittedly I really wish making a backup of the seed was not mandatory when creating a new wallet.  This is a huge barrier to entry when just trying to show someone how Bitcoin works in a social situation.  I understand a backup is critical and in the user's interest, but I would much prefer a nagging warning after the wallet is set up if the user chooses to skip the backup.  Then folks could get their feet wet and make a backup after they get into it.
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:32:14
No, it isn't "good enough".  Just because questionable purchases can be made today without authorities breaking down your door, that does not make it good enough.  These records are persisted until the end of time in a highly secure immutable ledger.  The entities that distribute most bitcoins (at least in the US) are heavily regulated and know your identity.  If they are not already, they will monitor your every transaction and correlate with your personal identity.  How is this remotely good enough?
I agree that bitcoin anonymizing technology will improve.  I think it will be a layer on top of the core protocol.  Mainstream adoption will require widespread wallet support and ease-of-use.  Not to say we can't get there, but it feels like workarounds with additional complexity, mixing time, and fees.  6 years after bitcoin's conception and we are still waiting for adequate solutions.

Bitcoin alternatives need to provide value above and beyond what bitcoin provides; they're fighting an uphill battle against the network effect.
The best opportunities to improve on bitcoin are:

I have to think that those at the top have a clear view of what's happening and are acting intentionally based on empirical data.  It would be in their best interest to skim off the people just below breaking point, without crossing that threshold where the system itself is threatened.
If that's true, the system as it exists today could last quite a long time, or they have a plan for what happens when it becomes mathematically unsustainable.
I wonder if bitcoin is a curveball not accounted for in that plan.

I agree, but how could they manipulate the price of bitcoin down long term?  With oil they had control of production, so they could coordinate a flooding of the market.
Eventually it has to come back to supply and demand, meaning the only way to push price down is if they have a lot of supply.  As they do so, they distribute bitcoin to the masses which loosens their influence.  So logistically, how could an entity manipulate the price long term?
Edit: Also with gold, a lot of the gold market is on paper since it's easier than dealing with physical gold.  With bitcoin, there's less need to have paper abstraction since it's virtual.  I think the gold market is more able to be manipulated from that perspective; paper gold is not the same as true gold reserves.

As I understand it, the implementation of SegWit could have been much simpler as a hard fork.
A hard fork would also allow a simple and safe block size increase to 2MBs for on-chain scaling.
The question then becomes why not hard fork to achieve the best of both worlds? I can only speculate, but I suspect a) "the powers that be" do not have the best intention of Bitcoin at heart necessarily, and b) a hard fork presents the market with choice of leadership which threatens the current status quo.
@_date: 2015-05-11 17:15:21

@_date: 2015-05-20 15:02:05
I think so too.  It seems we are on a continuous progression.  To what I don't know, but we are still evolving perhaps both physically and in consciousness.  Money is a fundamental force that affects the way humans organize.  Disruption of money could bring about changes so fundamental to our society that we cannot even imagine how the world will work in 100 years.  I'm pretty sure for the better.

For these reasons I think bitcoin in its current state is vulnerable to competition from natively anonymous altcoins.  That's not to say bitcoin will be replaced.  I see it serving as the global reserve in digital currency.  But there will be seamless interoperability with other coin ecosystems, and the market may come to prefer alternatives for specific purposes (like anonymity).
@_date: 2015-05-03 02:56:03
Yes, but you alluded to theories on why they correlate.  I'm curious what those are?  Political convenience to blame economic conditions on the outgoing president plus the population gets the warm fuzzies that the next guy will fix it?

Absolutely implication is cause for concern.  Look at the recent seizures that we've been hearing about on this thread.
@_date: 2015-05-03 20:09:51
Bitcoin is fair money. More specifically, bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network to transfer assets without a central middle man. Unlike government-controlled fiat money, bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million coins (infinitely divisible), making it deflationary and comparable to gold. Transactions on the Bitcoin network are fast, cheap, and not subject to third party restrictions.
More on how it works... bitcoin is maintained by a global network of computers called miners.  Anyone can install and run the bitcoin mining software.  Miners serve two purposes: verify transactions on the bitcoin network and introduce new bitcoins into circulation.
You see, in fiat currency, a small group of people get to create and spend new money.  You and I are not a part of this process.
In bitcoin, new money is produced according to a fixed schedule.  Miners compete against each other for a chance to receive newly created bitcoins, and their chance of success is directly proportional to the computing power they contribute to the network.  This makes it a fair and open market competition.
You don't need to know any of this in order to use bitcoin; all you need is a simple wallet like a phone app (e.g. Mycelium, Breadwallet) to send and receive.
I know it's a lot to take in at first.  You are on the right path my friend.  The first time I heard about bitcoin I quickly dismissed it.  About a year later it all clicked.  The key takeaways for why bitcoin is a real thing and NOT a scam:
- It's fair, driven by open market conditions that anyone can participate in.
- It's open source, meaning no illegitimate shenanigans are going on at the protocol level.
- It's permissionless, meaning no one can tell you who you can or cannot transact with.
- It's irreversible, meaning no one can take money away from you once you've received it (see chargebacks).
- It's cohesive and efficient; the modern financial system is comprised of many disparate parts (overhead).
- It's cheap; simplicity from the previous point translates directly into cost of use.
- It's programmable, meaning we don't even know what applications will be built on bitcoin in the future, just as no one could have predicted Facebook in the early days of the internet.
- It's deflationary; the supply is capped and so the value is likely to increase with usefulness per supply and demand.
- It's young; we are still in the early days :)
I hope this helps.

Users will be unable to withdraw funds without providing their first name, last name, and country of origin.
Identity requirements get more strict 8 days later for tiered withdrawal limits, although name and country coupled with other metadata is plenty to personally identify you.

I don't personally like the breadwallet UI for these reasons:
1. Address must be pre-copied to clipboard.
2. Swipe to send/receive but click upper left to view transactions.  Seems like it should be another swipe if you go that route, not upper left click.
3. Transactions are listed on same page as import private key and re-scan blockchain.
4. There is no real "main page".  From a landing page, I'd expect to view my balance, refresh, and initiate a send or receive.
Overall I think the functionality is there (especially like 0 confirmation spends) but I'm not a fan of the UI.
Edit: Also, balance is subtly displayed across the top.  That could definitely be improved.

Their effort to increase the block size limit.
@_date: 2016-01-20 10:36:01
Lets stick the merit of the argument.  Core is restricting transaction throughout based on an arbitrary network parameter instead of physical resource constraint.  Enough analysis had been done to convince myself and leading  Bitcoin experts that raising the block size is safe.  Core's refusal to do so, coupled with introducing RBF with very little consensus, is enough to lose my support.

The economic majority, full nodes, exchanges, and merchants are part of the ecosystem which miners are incentivized to align with to maintain the value of what they're mining.  That doesn't change the literal fact that majority hashing power defines the rules.  The rules are changing because the ecosystem majority wants it, as it should, per Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:24:10
But miners will reject blocks that do not conform to the rules of the majority hash power.  The majority hash power will produce the longest chain.  Thus, the longest chain defines what blocks are valid.
@_date: 2016-01-08 09:32:57

@_date: 2017-03-07 18:25:35
If a miner produces a block larger than 1 MB without majority hash power agreeing to accept it, the network will reject the block as invalid.
@_date: 2015-05-01 05:03:37
Or perhaps the lack of anonymity is far worse than we imagined and they embrace bitcoin because of its traceability.  Just playing devils advocate, although I do think that's a problem with current circumstances.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:19:33
No, because the network will reject that block.  It does not qualify as a valid block per the currently agreed upon rules of the network which is enforced by majority hash power.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:26:17
I can agree with that.  Currently, the community ascribes the most value to the token on the longest chain.  If a new coin was released / forked that didn't subscribe to the longest chain principle, the market can assess its value as well.  I suspect its value would be quite low.
@_date: 2015-05-15 21:36:32
I care.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:39:35
Sure.  If 50%+ of the network agrees to it.

It is revolutionary what advances like deep learning, self-assembling nanotechnology, 3D printed synthetic biological life, the genome and the connectome, immersive virtual reality, and self-driving cars might do for us. However impressive though, these are context-specific technologies. So when a revolution comes along that is as general and pervasive as to possibly reorchestrate all of the patterns of life, that is noticeable news of the new, and that is blockchains"

5 cents is a lot on $1 transactions.  Further, it's being made artificially high because of a protocol parameter, not physical resource constraint.

If the 'Core' development team doesn't want the free market to fork from its implementation, it needs to listen to and provide what the community wants, which right now is 2MB blocks.
Else, Bitcoin's decentralized nature will work around them as a central bottleneck.
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:00:15
The bottom line is the miners enforce the network rules.  You said so yourself that it is not yet workable for light clients to enforce network rules.
Bitcoin's basic premise is that majority hash power is acting in the interest of the network and not colluding.  The key is that miners are incentivized to protect the value of what they are mining, and that means enforcing rules that are economically acceptable to users.
Thus, majority hash power being able to set the rules is a good thing by design of most hash power acting in the interest of the network.
@_date: 2016-01-20 09:42:13
Correct.  That doesn't preclude multiple competing implementations.  There's just an agreed upon set of rules at any one given time.
@_date: 2016-01-14 05:24:58

@_date: 2016-01-20 22:17:40
I'm not opposed to SegWit, but it isn't ready to  deploy, nor do we know when it will be.  Do you have a better alternative than letting blocks fill up or raising the limit to 2mbs in the interim?
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:06:47
Yep makes a lot of sense.
Might make sense if the fee can only be increased to prevent replacing the fee with something that is more apt to get stuck.

Exactly.  Please wake up.  Support decentralized on-chain scaling.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:59:35

Catchy but ain't going to happen.  The consolidation of power is obvious (e.g. coordination of banning cash across countries) and speeding up.
@_date: 2016-01-20 09:46:27
The majority hash power sets the literal rules, and miners are incentivized to align the rules with whatever makes the coin the most profitable (i.e. what the majority of constituents want).
@_date: 2016-01-04 00:46:19
Looks cool, but I don't know how to interpret the results.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:37:45
That's a nice unqualified statement.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:22:04
Sure, there is nothing wrong with changing the rules of the original Bitcoin whitepaper.  It just needs to be done through a fork supported by majority hash power.  If majority hash power decides that following the longest chain is no longer the definition of Bitcoin, then so be it.  But it requires majority hash power to agree.  Until that time, that rule is still enforced ;-)
@_date: 2016-01-20 04:55:50
Bitcoin is special.  It's rule by majority consensus.  That's a good thing.
If Bitcoin Core wants to remain the predominant implementation, it must align itself with what the majority wants.  Bitcoin is not here to protect the interests of the minority, nor is it frozen in time from when you purchased it, as you suggest it should be.
The majority consensus is &gt;1MB blocks, which Bitcoin Classic supports and Bitcoin Core does not.  That explains its support more than shady backroom deals.
Most concerning, the censorship surrounding alternatives to Bitcoin Core brings into question the integrity of its software.  The truth should have nothing to hide.
@_date: 2016-01-20 09:36:18

Coinbase for example locked my funds until I answered a bunch of security questions, which I felt were none of anyone's business.  After almost a week of back and forth with support, I was able to close my account and recover my funds.

- SegWit will not activate
- The community will fork the blockchain
- The fork will bring a free-market solution to determining the block size that Core does not control
- Bitcoin will enjoy a more decentralized future both technically and politically
If I'm wrong, Bitcoin will continue to lose market share to alt coins.
Either way cryptocurrency wins.

Censorship on about bitcoin-related matters is completely unacceptable, period.  Especially when the promise of bitcoin is censorship resistance.  This community should not tolerate it for even one second.
Once again man proves himself to be corruptible in the face of power.  Hence why power and the medium through which it is exchanged must be decentralized.
Stop being control freaks and let people talk about bitcoin freely.

I sit in NYC so this impacts me directly.  I look forward to their decisions coming back to haunt them.  Control is slipping from their grasp.
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:49:50
I, too, question moving to XT.  I'm not in disagreement with raising the block size, but I'm concerned about giving Hearn the keys.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:38:35
Monero works today.

@_date: 2015-08-30 17:16:01
Links to substantiate your claim?
@_date: 2015-08-08 17:31:01
Correct.  I recommend the password be kept separate from how you send the file, especially for significant amounts.
@_date: 2015-08-18 13:42:49
Good luck.  Do you expect pushback from those who might want bitcoin to remain a *public* ledger?
@_date: 2015-08-04 15:38:05
The transaction fee is ~$0.03, not $0.003.
@_date: 2015-08-07 21:18:53
That about sums it up.
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:04:07
I listed the requirements in the password error message.  I may also post a static list with the requirements.
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:36:50
Currently no.  I actually had that in my first iteration of the site.  My main concern was someone could change the stated public address and lie about the contents of the money packet until its unlocked to verify its contents.
@_date: 2015-08-01 20:37:50
I'd add that nothing in the world could have blocked the transaction from happening once submitted with a sufficient transaction fee.
@_date: 2015-08-14 14:49:32
It makes me wish everyone would ignore the regulation with a united front.
@_date: 2015-08-30 15:51:56
No offense, I have learned that many computer science professors don't know much about practical software development.  Certainly not to overgeneralize, but these people should not be held on a pedestal.
@_date: 2015-08-08 17:02:00
That shouldn't be hard to add.
@_date: 2015-08-29 14:46:11
That's not true financial privacy.  You have no privacy with your credit cards, debit cards, bank accounts, 401k, IRA, etc.  Yes, it might be private to your neighbors, but not to your government or financial institutions.  True financial privacy means you alone know how your financial assets are managed. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:49:59
Yep, printable money packets.
@_date: 2015-08-30 15:47:59
I knew there was something I didn't like about it.  You formalized it.
@_date: 2015-08-08 19:40:36
Yes, I'm thinking a FAQ with a brief embedded video.
The website generates a private key using bitcore, encrypts it using the SJCL library and the user's input password, and saves the encrypted output from SJCL to a downloadable file format.  In essence, the file is just an encrypted private key which the website knows how to import and export.
The private key is encrypted within the file that the site gives you. That's the only place the private key exists.
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:43:05
I'm also hesitant about XT.  There's more than just a block size increase in there.
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:21:13
Well, it already is donated to the community as in the source and concept are now freely available.
The underlying file format is open and could be interoperable with other sites.  I can see it becoming a sort of specification, especially if you want to support other currencies.
As for me, I put a tip address on the site and figured those who get value can say thanks.
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:26:35
The sender can take the funds back (reverse it) until the receiver moves the funds out of the money packet.
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:59:00
It's easier to send someone coins directly if you know their receive address, I agree.  The issue is people are intimidated by the process of installing a wallet and getting a receive address.  The thinking behind this is someone can receive bitcoins in an email without doing a thing.  Then they might be motivated to install a wallet and claim the funds.  Or they could save that for another day and move the funds to a new money packet, effectively claiming them.  If they do nothing, the sender can eventually recover the funds.  The use case for this is not instantaneous and irreversible payments.
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:48:09
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:35:09
Anyone with access to the email account would receive the file.
You can communicate the password to open the file in a separate medium (text, phone, etc).  In fact this is generally recommended.
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:57:55
It's a way to share bitcoins in a way that people are already conceptually familiar with.  And this might motivate them to install a wallet.
@_date: 2015-08-08 17:34:43
I'm inclined to agree.  It's been a concern of mine that people will use a password they are more likely to forget because of the password requirements.  I just need to find the right balance with security.
@_date: 2015-07-14 03:18:13
This is correct.
@_date: 2015-08-25 17:47:06


That had to be expensive.
@_date: 2015-08-17 21:26:25
If you feel inclined, you can report theymos for violating Reddit's [moddiquette]( guidelines [here](
Three guidelines he may be breaking are:
- Remove content based on your opinion.
- Take moderation positions in communities where your profession, employment, or biases could pose a direct conflict of interest to the neutral and user driven nature of reddit.
- Ban users from subreddits in which they have not broken any rules.
Thanks to for [bringing this to attention](
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:15:43
SSL, high priority.  Good idea on the mouse movement, it's written down.
@_date: 2015-07-11 21:45:13
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:59:08
Banks break the rules, like money laundering for criminal organizations.  They receive a slap on the wrist if "caught".
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:25:04
Also, I discourage keeping your funds in bitfinex.  Get a real wallet (where you alone control the funds), like Copay or Electrum, and withdraw the funds to there as soon as your coins arrive.
As you start getting serious amounts invested, I recommend producing a secure paper wallet for long term storage, similar to how people use checking and savings accounts differently.
Come back with questions as you have them.
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:22:23
Thanks, will look at.
Edit: I have a running list of security improvements: https / ssl, gpg, de-minify dependencies, tls, increase encryption iteration count, stricter password requirements, advise user to not share password with file, BIP38 support, mouse movements to generate private key.
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:38:14
BIP38 support is on the short list.
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:10:01
You can purchase goods offered on Amazon.com through [Purse.io]( for significant discounts.
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:08:50
BIP38 support coming soon.  The main issue is a lot of browsers choke on it.  I will put a checkbox allowing BIP38 to be used and forewarn that the browser might take awhile or even crash.
@_date: 2015-07-15 15:22:40
It is not anonymous, not unless you really know what you're doing.  This is a misnomer.
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:41:30
@_date: 2015-07-14 03:22:07
Withdraw this from Changetip to a new money packet you create :)

Dollar cost averaging is your friend.  The price is higher than it has been the last few months right now.  There's no use in trying to time the markets, but I'd say there's a reasonable chance the price could go back down, so I wouldn't dump everything in at once.
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:43:10
It's running as JavaScript in your browser.  So the question is how secure is that?
I'm not a security expert so I welcome input from those more knowledgeable, but I think it depends on how paranoid you want to be.  At some level, it is possible this is compromised, so I would not trust it near a serious cold storage solution.  But I'm not worried about day to day usage, like how you'd use a phone wallet.
Also bitaddress.org disourages use of Opera Mini because they render JavaScript output server side.
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:13:27
The private key is encrypted within the file that the site gave you.  That's the only place the private key exists.
@_date: 2015-07-14 03:17:53
SSL/TSL just enabled.
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:52:30
There is no man in the middle for the website itself since it's client-side (especially when I get gpg key for verification).  I think the biggest risk is the email provider / client, as you said.
The file is password encrypted and the sender shouldn't send the password with the file.
Otherwise, email security is a valid concern, but one that's out of my hands.  I provide a file that can be sent.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:47:33
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:57:37
Good luck buddy.  Don't hesitate to ask as many questions as you need.
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:31:28
Ok, I agree.
@_date: 2015-07-15 01:54:08
- BIP38 encryption and decryption
- Modified the underlying file format to support BIP38
- Enabled HTTPS/SSL/TLS
- Increased SJCL iterations to 10000
- Improved password requirements: 6 characters, one uppercase, one lowercase
- De-minified dependency files
- Added user warning to not send money packet together with its password
- Minor cosmetics
Please let me know if you encounter any problems.
@_date: 2015-07-09 01:54:01
What if the decentralized system had its own private key, like Bitcoin, which it alone generates and controls.  To correlate votes with users, the entity must prove ownership of this key.  Is there no way to secure such a key in a decentralized system?
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:44:26
https, gpg, and de-minifying the dependencies are my next top priorities.
@_date: 2015-08-12 00:33:15
Three words put together to formulate a factual statement, shillin' like a pro.
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:07:41
So put a note discouraging the password from being shared with the file, written down.
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:27:07
The website generates a private key using [bitcore]( encrypts it using the [SJCL]( library and the user's input password, and saves the encrypted output from SJCL to a downloadable file format.
In essence, the file is just an encrypted private key which the website knows how to import and export.
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:03:03
I like it.  Guess it just needs someone to start!
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:56:05
Yes, that's completely fine.  Only when an address is used for the first time does it become a part of the bitcoin public ledger.
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:16:40
Cool, Microsoft appears to be embracing bitcoin more and more.  First they accept it, then they gave a talk the other day about how the blockchain can better society, now this.

I welcome thoughts on the name and anything design/branding.
@_date: 2015-07-31 14:25:46
In the case of the above website, it provides you a file which contains your encrypted private key (disclosure, I'm the author).
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:56:53
The sender has access to the funds until the recipient claims them by moving them to a bitcoin address or new money packet.
Only after the recipient moves the funds is the transaction irreversible.
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:27:06
Cool man, I'm so happy to hear it!
@_date: 2015-07-13 00:03:53
Optional BIP38 support is coming soon.  I would have started with that but a lot of browsers/computers cannot handle the JavaScript implementation.
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:40:00


Haha, I built this whole application trial by fire.  I know.
I'm sure it's easy to switch over, but I don't have a testnet version now.
@_date: 2015-07-13 01:39:31
I plan to tighten up password requirements.
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:11:13
Think of it like an envelope.  You put bitcoins in an envelope, email the envelope to someone, then they open the envelope to get the bitcoins out.
So moneypacket.org lets you:
1. Create the bitcoin envelope and save it to your computer.
2. Load the envelope with bitcoins.
Then lets say you email it to someone as an attachment.  You give them the password to open the envelope.
The recipient then:
1. Imports the file at moneypacket.org.
2. Enters the password you gave them to unlock it.
3. Claim the funds, either to a bitcoin address or new money packet.
So it's a way for someone to receive their first bitcoins as an email attachment without having a bitcoin wallet set up.
Edit: fixed formatting.
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:15:40
Bitcoin in its current state is far from private.
@_date: 2015-08-08 17:29:13
Fair question.  This came up when the site launched and [here was my response](
The short answer is because the site is 100% open source and client-side, you don't need to trust me.  Anyone is free to inspect the code and verify that it matches the source repository.  I'm not a trusted third party meaning I never have access to user funds, it's all done in your browser.
Being the site owner, I suppose I could pull off some funny business and hope it goes unnoticed (it wouldn't).  Of course I'm [not anonymous]( and I have no interest in going to jail.  That aside, stealing money from people runs counter to my beliefs and is the last thing I'd do, whatever that's worth :)
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:12:46
Interesting idea...
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:32:54
I believe I should not minify the dependencies.  That's what bitaddress.org did.  Noted!
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:15:37
Not sure if I'd call it a startup, but a website, 
@_date: 2015-07-13 02:50:02
This does not require a trusted party holding funds for you.
@_date: 2015-08-09 23:10:41
If the domain were to go offline, you could download the source files and run it directly in your browser.  The website is merely a domain to download the source files.
Standalone tool?  LMGTFY.  
The website uses the default algorithm provided by SJCL except I increased the iteration count to 10,000.
@_date: 2015-08-12 00:22:28
How does one who wants to pioneer these efforts get paid such that they can afford their bills?
Edit: the question is somewhat rhetorical.  As a developer, I feel a strong calling to commit my time and energy to this stuff but I still have bills to pay.
Edit 2: by the way great work.  It's inspiring.
@_date: 2015-08-03 01:27:24
[moneypacket.org]( lets you attach bitcoins to email without an account (author here).
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:14:59
Very interesting.
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:14:56
Sorry I'm mainstream and my eyes just glazed over :D
@_date: 2015-07-06 23:15:08
I agree with earlier sentiment "if it can be done, it will be done."  Begging people to not spam the blockchain isn't the right approach.  If they can spam it, effectively creating a DOS attack, then something about the fundamentals need fixed.
Ultimately I think this means making it prohibitively expensive to spam the blockchain.
A free market solution would adjust the fees based on available room in the blocks, which is a function of block size and demand.
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:16:19
I recommend using it for small amounts only.  I think having money pass through email systems will test the security of those systems like never before.
@_date: 2015-07-02 00:32:09
For your wallet, I've tried Copay, Mycelium, Electrum, Breadwallet, and BitherOS.  I can confidently recommend Copay as the best, hands down.  You can install it on Android and your computer and share a single account between them.
The next challenge is acquiring bitcoin.  As others have mentioned, Coinbase, Circle, and localbitcoins.com are all good options.
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:46:12
Roger that.
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:53:13
My advise is to not listen to others when they say "It's been done."  You'll get that a lot with creative ideas.  It's hard for people to understand the nuances that make an idea novel or how it improves on existing things.

It's released under the MIT license, which I believe permits the code to be copied, changed, monetized, etc.  They just have to include the same license with the code.
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:56:29
My thinking as well.
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:44:59
They are trusted third parties.  You have an account with them and they hold funds on your behalf.
@_date: 2015-07-30 10:42:14
Plausible indeed.
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:03:10
I highly recommend Copay.  Perhaps compare to Breadwallet and see which you like more.
Edit: Copay is open source, written in JavaScript so it runs on all devices, UI is clean, 4 tabs: Home, Receive, Send, Transactions, and I respect BitPay for releasing the first mainstream bitcoin commercials and the bitcore developer library which powers applications like [moneypacket.org]( (shameless plug).
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:50:45
Thank you.  And soon.
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:40:32
The anonymity offered by Monero is fundamentally superior, I think.  Only thing is, Monero really needs a tooling ecosystem to develop.  Developers like myself would like to build apps on Monero, but we need easy to use APIs.

Cool, thanks!
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:51:00
Very good question.  Users are protected because the site is open source and client-side.  This means a) anyone can inspect the code for funny business, and b) the entire site runs locally on your device only, not on a server that I or anyone else controls.
Soon I will figure out https and add gpg public keys to verify that the site's live running code matches what's in the source repository, didn't get around to that for this alpha release.  That will make the site fully "trustless".  Until then, rest assured I'm not taking anyone's coins :)
@_date: 2015-07-27 04:38:07
Payment processors.  Remittance markets.  Merchants that accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-16 15:25:51
Using it is easy.  I recommend installing Copay on your phone and/or computer.  Copay will give you "receive addresses" to which you can receive bitcoin.  You could transfer the changetip tips people have been giving you to your Copay wallet, for example.  Sending is just as easy from the wallet: enter a receive address and send the funds.
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:27:01
It's like they've made it intentionally bad to reinforce the bitcoin=scam association.
@_date: 2015-07-10 03:34:17
Wouldn't that spread the spam out across 10 minute increments, and wouldn't that be good?
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:05:13
Yep, noted.
@_date: 2015-07-13 01:33:21
Yep, thanks.
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:02:28
Thanks, I kept thinking to myself its beauty is its simplicity.  I'm kind of surprised it took this long.
@_date: 2016-02-15 14:27:14
I use Bitcoin out of principle, but that's not what makes it work.  Bitcoin works because the economic incentives are properly aligned.  Miners do not mine out of the goodness of their heart or principles alone, at the end of the day it's about money.
@_date: 2016-02-13 23:40:30
Why would there be plenty of people wanting to pour money into a dying branch of Bitcoin.  It doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:27:52
Thanks covanga!
@_date: 2016-02-13 23:45:03


I really think it's that simple.  The old fork will quickly die and the whole group will agree to the new rules.
I support this; it's simple majority vote.  Disagree?  Sorry, but the *majority* overrules you.
@_date: 2016-02-11 04:02:47
I think it should be as close to "ay your coffee" as possible by physical network constraints and open market fees.
@_date: 2016-02-26 03:52:00
I appreciate the clarity and transparency.  I continue to be impressed with Brian Armstrong.  Coinbase is an exchange for government currency.  I disapprove of privacy invasion, but Coinbase's core business is to interface with the legacy system, so they have no choice but to work within it.  If they didn't, people backed with guns would eventually shut them down.
@_date: 2015-07-27 04:33:42
To me it's online forums like Reddit, meetups, startups, developers, miners, speculators, political activists, hardware manufacturers, financial institutions, and hobbyists.  I'm sure other sub-communities could be named.
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:23:07
It "works" on mobile but not very well, has been my experience.  I recommend using a desktop.
I'm also aware of an issue if you're using an outdated version of Safari on iPhone.  If you check your debug console (enabled through settings), you might get an error message which is helpful to me.
@_date: 2016-02-23 00:45:13
Yep, sounds about right.
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:40:07
I see this being a transitionary tool, a new medium for people to get their first bitcoins before they have a wallet.  Long term people will have wallets and share their address, like email.
@_date: 2015-07-09 01:44:28
Not necessarily.
@_date: 2015-07-16 01:45:11
That's definitely a problem.  A lot of businesses won't be as viable without accepting zero confirms, ShapeShift comes to mind.
Is the idea that a bad player could send a transaction with a low fee, get the merchandise, then re-spend the funds using a higher fee to push the transaction through?
@_date: 2015-08-29 01:05:38
I personally would be surprised if bitcoin offered true anonymity any time soon, but I like to be pleasantly surprised.
Meanwhile, Monero works today, is untraceable at the protocol level, and was ethically released.  Disclaimer, I own some, because it's a big fat first and I believe in financial privacy.
@_date: 2016-02-13 23:48:40
I appreciate the alternative perspective but wholeheartedly reject it.  Bitcoin is majority rule, a direct democracy.  That's the beauty of it, it's simple and fair.
By "majority" I mean majority hashpower, i.e. 51% or more of the network.
Edit: only in does a true statement like this get downvoted.
@_date: 2016-02-14 00:07:54
Ok, but chances are your branch will be quickly consumed by the bigger branch, so I hope you don't put all your eggs in one basket.  But I agree it is your right to run a different branch and I support you exercising that right free from interference.
@_date: 2016-02-14 10:00:37
Sure I agree.  But there's no economic incentive to split from the main chain, whereas there's a lot of incentive to stay with the dominant chain for the benefits of network effect.
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:02:39

Just talking about republicans vs democrats is distracting from the issue.  It's we the people... and the system of control that is largely against the people and appears to be global.  Democrats and republicans are relatively low on the totem pole and serve to give the illusion of choice, of which there ultimately is none.

The transaction is visible to the entire network instantly.  It takes 10 minutes per confirmation.  6 confirmations is considered permanent without a doubt.  It depends on the merchant's tolerance for risk/reward for when to accept it.  Small, real-time transactions (e.g. a bakery, etc) would be fine to accept 0 confirmations.  Larger purchase or transactions that require shipping might wait longer.
I'm not sure how common or much of a threat double spends really are.  Can someone comment?

I take it back, maybe you aren't a troll.  If so I apologize.  But here's the deal, fiat currency is not a peer to peer money system.  It's a centrally controlled money system that benefits a few at the expense of the many.  Once you see the scam for what it is, you recognize why bitcoin / precious metals are "real money" and fiat is not.

Not true.  If your identity is linked to a first transaction, it may be reasonably associated with subsequent transactions in the blockchain.  A number of indicators may improve confidence, such as amount and frequency (e.g. if I purchase 1 btc, then withdrawal .1 btc x 10 to cold storage).  Companies are being formed around this type of analysis.

Bitcoin is merely a tool, a force for good or evil depending on how it is used.  Cash and the internet are used for illegal activities all the time.  We don't blame these tools for illegal misconduct, they simply facilitate it.
I agree that a few folks got in early and snatched up insane amounts of bitcoins for pennies on the dollar.  I don't think that makes it a corrupt system though.  These people recognized the potential before everyone else and made the most of it, the right person at the right place and time.  I don't think that compromises the integrity of the system, though.  The world can afford a few insanely few rich people - good for them.

With limited supply, all the money in the world pouring into Bitcoin would drive the price through the roof, or shall we say to the Moon.
No one could ever buy all the Bitcoins in the world with all the money in the world, but they could skyrocket the price.  That's why I think there's a lot of upswing to Bitcoin as an investment.  Limited supply, unlimited demand, and we're still in the early days.

Yes, Coinbase is a reputable service to purchase and trade bitcoins.  Think of a Coinbase as any other regulated bank but for bitcoin.
This also means they will fractionally reserve your coins and monitor your transactions for AML/KYC compliance.  Coinbase is known to be especially intrusive on this latter point.
The coins you 'own' on Coinbase are actually IOUs until withdrawn.  Further, because of the architecture of bitcoin, they will be able to continue to monitor your transactions even after your withdrawal.
Good luck and have fun.

Count on consumers to "incorrectly" use bitcoin.  They will print a QR code and re-use it for every transaction in their business, etc.
Yes, wallet software needs to be developed to support anonymity.  Personally I'm a little skeptical of Dark Wallet at this point, but I would like to being proven wrong.
Otherwise, alternative digital currencies can and are offering better protection natively (i.e. at the protocol level).

I don't know enough about OpenBazaar, but my hope is we get a decentralized layer to manage reputation and sits atop the blockchain, almost like a protocol.  Different marketplaces, which may or may not be decentralized, could spring up on top of this underlying layer, but with different business models, user interfaces, etc.
Edit: The point is building centralized solutions on top of decentralized "protocols" can be the best of both worlds.  And just because eBay is popular today, doesn't mean competitors can't take over tomorrow, especially if they offer super competitive fees which they would by utilizing cheap open decentralized solutions.

Always remember, you don't own your bitcoins unless you own your private keys.
Coinbase bitcoins are actually IOUs.  Ultimately they control your private keys, so you're violating the above (although their vault feature does let you manage your own keys, I believe).
I recommend you move your coins to a local wallet that you control, like Electrum, Mycelium, Breadwallet, etc.
Write down the recovery passphrase from your wallet of choice and store it in at least 2 safe places.  That way you can regenerate your wallet if your computer crashes, house burns down, etc.

It doesn't necessarily decrease the value of the dollar, but it does necessarily increase the bitcoin to dollar exchange ratio.
The value of the dollar can decrease through inflation (printing a shit ton more dollars), or the people's loss of confidence in its purchasing power.
If everyone's dollars started pouring into Bitcoin, it's indicative that they're losing confidence in the dollar at least relative to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:18:19
I think the difference with Bitcoin is you can really transact with it.  Gold is a good store of value because it's finite and universally valued.  The problem with gold is you can't chip off $1.75 to purchase a cup of coffee.  This made paper representation (fiat currency) a convenient alternative while bars of gold sat in a vault.  And it's fiat currency that's causing a mess.
Bitcoin is different because it offers the store of value that gold but can be transacted in any amount and globally.  Thus no paper/fiat representation is necessary.  Suddenly the world is using fair money.

Another tip: Coinbase is subject to KYC/AML laws, so your transactions will be monitored, especially if you send/receive directly from their service and likely even after.

We have to keep an open mind to new technologies.  Else we're no better than those that fail to see the potential in Bitcoin.

Gold's inability to be trasacted in everyday purchases means people use an abstracted layer (fiat), which very much affects macroeconomics.
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:19:33
Yep what I was just saying.
@_date: 2015-04-06 17:54:23
Hence why we badly need wallets protect anonymity.
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:11:07
Yup.  I mention it to folks in passing and you can see the gears turn.  They've heard of it somewhere, can't place where, but certainly have no idea what it is.  When asked "What is bitcoin?" I simply respond "It's a peer-to-peer money system" and don't press it any further unless asked.
@_date: 2015-04-02 05:02:05
Is it really so hard to get right?
@_date: 2015-04-26 15:09:16
Paranoia implies it's unfounded.  Stealing happens, I don't think it's unfounded.
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:37:56
Things happen slowly until they happen fast.  Economies collapse overnight.
And by "printed on a whim", yes it's a bit more calculated than that.  I think the point is a tiny few make the decision of when and why to print more money.  The rest of the population do not enjoy these privileges.

Well, coming from suburban America, NYC is pretty foreign to me.  I'm in the first few days of learning what the hell this place is.  Speaking of, I think I'll walk outside and choose from 1 of 100 places to eat on my block :)
@_date: 2015-09-05 20:38:21
Yep.  Do not let him get away with stealing your money.
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:23:08
Right, it gives ultimate control to the Bitcoin holders, potentially ending the era of seized bank accounts, etc.  You have money in your bank because they let you have money in your bank.  With Bitcoin you don't need anyone's permissions to transact and hold.

Personally I think mass acceptance is inevitable.  I've even cut back on how much I talk about it in hopes that prices stay low for longer.  If they do, many of us should be able to acquire enough for early retirement if prices do what we expect.
@_date: 2015-04-12 22:17:31
Least to most:
1. Online wallet (e.g. coinbase, circle).
2. Deterministic offline wallet (e.g. electrum, mycelium).
3. Paper wallet (securely generated from bitaddress.org).
@_date: 2015-04-06 17:55:31
Yep this is the guy.  Thanks for chiming in.
@_date: 2015-04-03 21:57:56
Fair enough.

The more I go through the "real world", the more I come to understand the "education" process to be a bunch of B.S.  Question everything, my friend.
@_date: 2015-04-19 00:48:37
Coinbase and Circle are two of the most common ways to acquire bitcoin, at least here in the United States.  So it's not anonymous for a large portion of users.
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:04:24
And one last tip, since why not.  If you start to accumulate any serious wealth in bitcoin, it's worth moving some coins off to "unhackable" paper wallets for long term storage.
Congratulations on your first bitcoin purchase.  Really.

Why should we give up our freedom just because the sitting president says so.  The people didn't ask for any of this.  The government is supposed to represent the people, I thought.

Being on a Bitcoin subreddit, I'm reading between the lines.
@_date: 2015-04-26 15:13:02
Everyone I know knows I'm into bitcoin.  At this point I have stopped talking about it.  People ask questions when they are ready to hear the answers.
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:39:53
This is where I disagree.  I think it's through the control of people's productive output (a.k.a. people's money) that they are able to sustain control of land and resource.
Albeit controlling land and resource does put them in a position to continue controlling people's productive output.
Edit: grammar
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:42:13
I give Bitcoin more credit than that.  The financial system is fundamental to the system of control that dominates this planet.  Change that and amazing things can happen.
@_date: 2015-04-28 11:51:22
"Bitcoin not bombs" is actually a really good slogan.  It hints at what bitcoin is all about, for me anyway.

Yep, when the loops start to close, moon :)
@_date: 2015-04-29 15:24:42
Yesterday was pretty good, I thought.  It was the first time I've been around so many bitcoiners in person.  I felt at home!
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:28:39
Yep I think of it like this too.  In an inflationary system with unlimited money supply, it's easy to consolidate wealth to a few.
In a deflationary system with finite supply, I think wealth will naturally distribute more equally.
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:02:46
Yep, I've experienced the same.  It's just not part of their normal transaction flow, so the staff aren't really trained on it.
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:44:41
Haha thank you.
@_date: 2015-04-09 18:06:36
Yep makes sense to me.  From hence forth I will call it saving.
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:05:42
I don't understand.  How is downloading bitcoin core, waiting a week to sync, and chewing through 30+ GBs of hard drive space, easier or more secure than...
Using Electrum or Mycelium and writing down the passphrase and storing in safe locations.
Or if you want really secure: downloading a website to a thumbdrive, booting into tails on a non-networked computer, and printing out encrypted paper wallets.
Edit: as others have said, your wallets should not be generated or imported on a live website, but instead from a downloaded version of the website running in a secure environment (like tails without connectivity).
@_date: 2015-11-28 02:21:46
I feel like there should have been more discussion around such an impactful change.

Why is bitcoin not an investment strategy?  What better place to put your earnings to change the world, aside from a few exceptions like companies that provide value, the nice homeless guy you sorta know.
Sure you gotta diversify, but I think bitcoin and digital currency is a legitimate investment strategy for those that foresee a probable future of how value will be exchanged.

Keep us posted.
@_date: 2015-11-03 00:49:07
No, there is an easy answer.  Let discussion flow freely so people can inform themselves and choose to believe what they want.  Putting someone in charge of the discussion violates the spirt of bitcoin in so many ways, which is *no one is in charge*, *everyone plays by the same rules*.
@_date: 2015-11-20 00:52:55
I respectfully disagree with your worldview.


That sounds right, because these are less controllable.
@_date: 2015-03-06 02:59:08
I think that's a great point, that voter secrecy can discourage or prevent foul play.  Now if only it were one human, one vote, voting on direct issues, majority rules?

I showed it to my ex-girlfriend and she couldn't understand why it struck me as odd.  To her it seemed like any other bank advertisement.

As far as I can tell, this means using bitcoin is illegal in NC without permission from the state, no?  Thank you for sharing.
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:27:33
We do need a wallet that can provide anonymity and is easy to use.
@_date: 2015-11-30 02:29:02
Haha nice
@_date: 2015-03-27 20:57:51
Bitcoin is fair money.  More specifically, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network to transfer assets without a central middle man.  Unlike government-controlled fiat money, Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million coins (infinitely divisible), making it deflationary and comparable to gold.  Transactions on the Bitcoin network are instant, cheap, and not subject to third party restrictions.
@_date: 2015-03-18 03:49:08
I believe the problem is more fundamental than that.
@_date: 2015-03-03 13:12:03
No less secret than today's system.  You register your identity to vote and are given a ballot to cast.  In this case you register your identity to vote and are given a vote coin.  Secrecy is only compromised if your identity is associated with the coin they give you (it doesn't have to be).
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:17:25
I appreciate the insight.
@_date: 2015-03-21 03:31:52
That's a good idea.
@_date: 2015-10-27 03:01:03
But why should we have to pay bitcoin for a wallet to be listed under the "All wallets" list.  Seems their primary objective is to monetize it.  Something feels wrong with this.
@_date: 2016-05-06 05:05:01
Cool!  Really looking forward to how this business model plays out.
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:44:35
Yep, Bitcoin has shown me how dysfunctional the conventional system is.
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:21:15
Don't be surprised if it immediately loses value.  You're buying in during a price surge.
@_date: 2015-03-14 04:42:48
Thank you for surfacing these quotes.  $2
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:43:17
I'm not so sure.  There are many wonderful and valid use cases for a public ledger.  It's not clear if Bitcoin will ever adopt privacy at the protocol level.  This leaves room for altcoins to make private currencies more convenient to use.
@_date: 2016-05-09 07:58:42
Bitcoin has a price, an ascribed value. Thus it is an asset per your definition.

Thanks for spreading the love.  $1
@_date: 2015-11-29 16:50:38

I doubt it's a technical hurdle that's stopping them.
@_date: 2015-11-29 16:54:28
But it kills Bitcoin the coffee currency.  Perhaps this is inevitable, but I see no reason to rush it.
@_date: 2016-05-09 02:39:51
What a blatant violation of American rights.
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:14:55
This is great.  You are taking action to change the world the way you see fit.  I'm not saying bitcoin/decentralized currency is the answer to all problems, but I certainly think the human race would benefit from using a medium of exchange that isn't constantly being devalued by a minority elite who don't play by the same rules as the rest of us.
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:18:18
The price was driven up with a few rapid bursts.  It may have been artificially high this whole time.  Extended 'pump and dump' if you will.  Who knows.
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:15:57
Sounds sketchy.
@_date: 2015-10-21 00:10:01
Nice guys!!
Personally I think Copay is one of the best wallets out there.
Keep keeping it simple.
@_date: 2015-11-06 00:48:42
Absurd isn't it.
@_date: 2015-10-14 02:17:08

@_date: 2015-11-04 04:02:11
blockchain.info gets a lot of flak, and not necessarily for bad reasons.  Honestly I'd recommend copay which works on all devices and only you control your coins.
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:58:42
If it can be done, it will be done, with or without our knowledge.  He's doing us a favor by demonstrating what's possible.
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:40:20
I think (hope) he's being sarcastic.  Why should one human being rule over another?
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:38:44
I too am optimistic about the future.
@_date: 2015-10-21 16:04:17
It's open source for anyone to review, which factors into my endorsement.
@_date: 2016-05-09 02:53:34
What exactly is an "asset" in this context?  Bitcoin is literally a ledger, a unit of account, that no single entity controls and anyone can write to.  Feels like "asset" is a human made up thing.
@_date: 2015-03-14 05:09:49
Yep interchangeability will be (is) easy.  I think Bitcoin will be a major player but others can provide utility too.
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:45:46
Are his fees off too?  It might cost ~3 cents to push a transaction through the network, but it can cost more to exchange USD for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-22 05:52:45
I'm not in disagreement with you but it's good to be nice to people.
@_date: 2015-02-22 05:21:30
Might be nice to be vague and have someone else figure out the details.  The ultimate lazy.  Don't know if that'd work with the general public.
@_date: 2015-03-20 02:24:34
Not in the sense that they will steal your bitcoins.  But they will monitor the shit out of your transactions.
@_date: 2015-02-03 06:43:20
Why should the Bitcoin Foundation be disbanded, specifically?
@_date: 2015-02-27 02:47:50
I think it's lack of anonymity and slow confirmation times.  Competitors will offer solutions but Bitcoin is more restricted to change.
@_date: 2015-10-28 17:23:37
Then a new blockchain will come out that has private transactions and this will be irrelevant.
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:59:48
Also, reputation systems have legitimate real-world use cases.
@_date: 2015-10-21 00:22:28
I wish you the best with this.  We need marketplaces supported by crypto.

To preserve privacy of your IP address: use TAILS, TOR, and/or VPN.
To preserve privacy of your bitcoin transactions on the blockchain:
1. Receive bitcoin to a new account you control.
2. Exchange bitcoin for monero.
3. Exchange monero for bitcoin, preferably somewhere else or at a later date to avoid receiving back the same bitcoin you originally exchanged.

Scientific evidence suggests we’re on an evolutionary journey that is still in motion.  Changing our monetary system could be a next big step in that journey, just as the internet was.  I try to support this stance in how I store and spend my productive output.  Every [insert unit of currency here] is a vote.
