Yup. It was posted [here]( :)

Correct, ICANN does not allow any transfers from a receiving registrar for the first 60 days. See you soon!

Hey FMTY - can you let me know what your ticket number is? I work for Namecheap and would like to look into this for you.
@_date: 2013-03-05 03:45:56
Glad you guys spotted it. Official announcement coming tomorrow ;)
@_date: 2013-03-05 13:51:39
No coupons. You can renew for several years at a time for a baked in savings. The more years you renew for, the greater the savings.

Thanks for the comment, Gibybo. I'm escalating it to our engineering team.

I'm Namecheap's community manager. We asked you for this so that we can implement it immediately. I posted about this last week [here](
You don't have to ask us to accept it because it's going to happen :) We promise.

Hey guys - 
Another update from Namecheap here.
Yes, Bitcoin is going to happen. And it's going to happen soon.
However, we're just in the beginning of getting this set up and testing. Please wait for us to provide you with further instruction. We aren't ready yet to open up the system for testing. We know where to find you when we are. 
In other words, please do not contact us via chat and please do not create a ticket until we're ready. Most of the staff is not yet ready to answer questions regarding Bitcoin's implementation. This is a high priority for us on the development side, but the support staff is not yet able to assist on these matters. **We only sent the above to a few select individuals, and do not need any further volunteers at this time.**

Well, for one, we've won the Lifehacker "best domain registrar" award two of two times.
[Here]( and [here](
For another, we're a freedom loving registrar. We donated over $100,000 to the Electronic Frontier Foundation to help keep the fight for internet freedom alive with the introduction of SOPA and CISPA. Our latest fundraiser is still underway [here](
Our pride is our customers, and we are completely focused on doing what it takes to make you happy :) That's why we're integrating Bitcoin: you've asked, and we've answered.
p.s. we're cheaper than some of those, but that doesn't mean our service falters. ;)
@_date: 2013-02-26 13:58:15
.cc [is accepted]( :)
@_date: 2013-02-25 19:52:38
That would be correct.
@_date: 2013-03-05 20:26:07
And an update: 
Bitcoin's roll out was pretty fast - we honestly decided to take it on 2 weeks ago. We'll be evaluating the solution and hopefully will be rolling out your suggestions in the future.
(and yes, I am from Namecheap, in case you were all wondering)
@_date: 2013-03-05 20:28:35
Yes, we just got this set up last night. Hang tight, it's happening. ;)
@_date: 2013-03-06 04:18:01
Here, see point  on this page: 
@_date: 2013-03-05 20:27:32
Just so you know, you can move to Namecheap at any time. If your domain that you bought with GoDaddy expires in 2017, we add a year anyway for an expiration in 2018, so you get what you paid for with them and a bonus on top of that.
Tamar, Namecheap's Community Manager

We should be good for now, but we'll let you know if we need more testers.
@_date: 2013-03-05 15:03:31
And now it's officially official.

It's a top priority, but we need to make sure it's ready before it's rolled out.
@_date: 2013-07-15 19:35:08
Fixed, thanks for the feedback: 
@_date: 2013-02-26 13:46:45
ha. Downvoted for being bitcoinclueless. Fair enough. 
But one thing I will say: ya'll didn't click on the link on the "about us" page. I'm a she.
FWIW, apparently people did need the verification that this really was coming from Namecheap (re: beala's tweet last night, linked above), so this was an appropriate place to put it ;)

We're starting development on this, so hang tight. It will happen. :)

You mean, Namecheap verification? [Here you go](
Just a note, I've posted on behalf of Namecheap many many times in the past. You can find me [here]( (I'm on the bottom of the list). 
More proof, if you'll call it that:
