I never said it wasn't, honestly no one can really know what's going to happen, but we only look at one side in this subreddit, and it's grating. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 05:40:46
Get out of here with your logic!
@_date: 2014-04-30 22:58:42
Comments like this make me hover unsubscribe. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:18:31
I'm sure their lawyers could solve that.
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:18:34
Does this site still work?
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:19:54
I wonder if this will extend to IAP through bitcoin. Doubt it though...
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:35:38
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.
@_date: 2014-05-01 05:39:56
It's a possibility, but the out of the 62 upvotes, how many are legit?
@_date: 2014-05-05 19:19:00
Sounds good, thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2014-05-01 04:13:40
I mean, was he being sarcastic?
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:47:50
Haha, this guy will regret this in a few eons.
@_date: 2015-03-10 04:01:38
Thanks, I'll check it out.
@_date: 2015-03-10 04:04:08
Thanks, how was your experience?
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:34:57
You have to link a bank account on coinbase or can only use a visa card, and they charge a 3.1% transaction fee. 
@_date: 2013-08-30 05:55:11
I get that, but I don't think it excuses the hostility.
@_date: 2013-08-30 05:29:40
I've never had an issue, but I only use it to URL mask my source code. It's cheap and they don't bother you, and the newsletter is fairly entertaining. What's being ruined?
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:55:30
You can just give away that much willy nilly. while it's more than I have at all.
How much BTC do you have? O_o
@_date: 2013-09-02 21:48:54
Jesus christ, how dare he question our lord and savoir bitcoin. We might as well burn him at the stake no?
@_date: 2013-08-30 05:16:13
Why? Because they don't support one sort of currency your a huge fan of? That's like not buying chick-fila because the owner is homophobic, your only hurting the employees,  dreamhost is still a good service.
@_date: 2013-08-30 16:47:39


There's a difference between bitcoin enthusiasts and bitcoin evangelists.
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:59:26
Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:50:26
I have to agree, but having no method to obtain them, it feels like gold is raining from the sky and I can't pick any up. I know bitcoin is much more than that but that's just how it feels.
@_date: 2013-08-30 16:37:38
I'm not claiming to be a "victim" of said attacks, but when I come here looking for actual news or information and find the majority of articles are "success stories"  of major sources writing about bit-coin or witch-hunts on people who dismiss it as a valid currency, to me, it fails.
@_date: 2013-08-30 16:46:49


Why? Will it fail if you don't? 
@_date: 2013-09-15 21:10:52
So does the entire stability of bitcoin rest on technological process? What happens if there is ever a sort of "wall" in technological progression, could bitcoin entirely crash then?
@_date: 2013-08-30 05:58:04
I think there's a fine line between defending and attacking though, one that this subreddit crosses often. This is the largest bitcoin community on reddit, one of the leading sites on the Internet, it might not have that much effect but it's not invisible, and if it is, it's already failed its self proclaimed mission.
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:17:53
Wait, you mean it isn't?
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:40:05
Don't I have to be invited first? That's what it is telling me.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:06:40
Why can't you be both?
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:28:43
Thanks for the info, Have you done online transactions with it?
@_date: 2013-08-30 17:34:51
Wait, are you vouching for litecoin or bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:22:12
Really? Why?
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:45:48
You still have to find someone in person, or trust them.
@_date: 2013-11-01 20:01:33
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:56:31
I have 0.003 more than OP! HA!
@_date: 2013-09-15 20:46:18
What's to stop the difficulty from getting so high that bitcoin becomes economically impossible?
@_date: 2013-09-13 21:39:49
It's back up
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:23:57
Do you have any experience with the site, it seems incredibly easy to be scammed.
@_date: 2013-10-15 20:04:03
@_date: 2013-09-11 02:51:35
You're goddamn right.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:21:06
Im just sitting here wishing I could buy some, you'd think the currency of the internet would be easier to obtain.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:58:49
Wish I had your uncle.
@_date: 2013-09-13 21:03:53
That sucks man, is there anything we should learn from this, or was it an exploit through mine-craft, not bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-08-30 16:51:39
Is this sarcasm? Sarcasm doesn't read well through text.
@_date: 2013-09-15 20:57:57
How does that alter the encryption behind bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-08-30 16:42:09
That's fine but as a whole this sub doesn't seem to take that "Don't waste my time" attitude, they go out of their way to attack that source and laugh at how idiotic they are far more than simply asking such a source to do their research or just ignoring it.
@_date: 2013-09-11 21:42:37
Thanks mate, this will help reach my goal of reaching .01 bitcoin without making a deposit happen much sooner!
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:24:32
Well I don't use facebook so that's not an option...
@_date: 2013-08-30 05:54:47
Why's that?
@_date: 2013-08-23 05:16:01
Question, are you inserting bitcoin here just because you can? It's not like those features are exclusive to bitcoin. Y'all are a bit too optimistic about bitcoin.
