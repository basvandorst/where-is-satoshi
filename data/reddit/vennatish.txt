Lol, Bitcoin is more transparent than a bank account/credit card and not anonymous at All by itself. In-case you didn't know, your ISP sees every transaction you make and every bitcoin address you use. Then there's the part that Bitcoin's blockchain is transparent and anaylsis can undo any sort of "pseudo-anonymity" provided by Bitcoin.

Dash's  masternodes are by default, centralized. The fact is that the vast majority of Dash's nodes are hosted on Amazon webservers. If Amazon wanted, they could spy on Dash' transactions right now(Or already are).

The only cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin that's even worth mentioning is Monero.
(I like NXT, I like Ethereum but I don't consider them "currencies" so to speak, more like applications to build things on)

Oh it changed a bit, thanks for that anyway. All of the hosting sites are centralized(worse than I thought), so the entire masternode network is centralized.

True. Though I doubt either currencies would adopt PoS(Which is the most popular outside of PoW).

Moneros distribution isn't ending until decades from now. If a better alternative to PoW isnt made by then(Decades from now), then something would be seriously wrong with crypocurrencies in general.

OP is wrong on so many levels....An inflationary economy is many, many, many times better and more sustainable than a deflationary economy. 
This is why bitcoin can't be the world's "reserve currency" as some fanatics wish it to be. Too much deflation and the economy will enter into a harsh depression.

Centralization makes things easier, faster, more scalable. But goes against the entire nature of a decentralized, trustless system, of which is Bitcoin. If you want a centralized system, go use the USD, no point in even using Ripple.

The opposite. Bitcoin is the gold of cryptocurrencies. It's best use case is high value international or domestic transfers for little fees since it's not fit for microtransactions(Buying small items like candy for ex isn't worth it/doesnt make sense because of the high fees) etc. Bitcoin is the reserve, highest valued currency.  
Monero truly is more like the everyday currency to "pick up some milk" with because of its default anonymity and because "beating" Bitcoin is almost impossible because of its huge first mover advantage.

Is it possible to implement the core details/featues of Zerocash into Ring Signatures/Monero?
I like zerocash, but for me, the concerns and problems it creates is far more than the positives and problems it fixes. It's too anonymous in the sense that you can't see what's going on at all in the blockchain, if a flaw is found or if the cryptography is one day broken, that can be taken hugely taken advantage of by an attacker, and you'll never be able to tell. It's also impractible(for being too anonymous) to be used by consumers as a regular currency, tax purposes, etc .
This is why I prefer ring signatures personally, and why I want to know if it's possible to implement the core features that make zerocash "that anonymous" while preserving the "dual system" of both anonymity and transparency that cryptonote/monero provides.
*Yes I use cryptonote synonymously with Monero because its the best working and by far most popular implementation of cryptonote*
