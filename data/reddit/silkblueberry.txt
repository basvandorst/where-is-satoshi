Well, I think the issue is that the South Korean banking system makes it extremely hard to move money in and out of their country which makes it very hard to triage any price differences between the South Korean exchanges and the outer world.  And that's why they are always paying a high premium.  If the friction wasn't there the price difference would be immediately arbed and we would never see the crazy premium.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:47:59
For a long time there has been a giant premium in the South Korean markets for most crypto assets.  If it was so easy to arbitrage fiat currency across the South Korean border (their banking system) then why would arbitragers just leave free money sitting on the table?  The fact is, this arbitrage friction is absolutely reflected in the premiums.

Mike, I like you a lot and I really appreciate your video.  However you've dropped the ball in your documentary by not making any distinction between public and private environments.  Hash Graph runs in private permissioned environment which is why it can achieve high performance.  Comparing Hash Graph to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is not really fair because Bitcoin runs in a permissionless environment.  You are comparing apples to oranges in your documentary which just isn't right.  And you go from lauding freedom to promoting a private permissioned (aka authoritarian incentivization) network instead of open source permissionless networks.  It just doesn't add up to me.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:06:37
Yes, I think that Hash Graph, like all the other projects, has a certain set of tradeoffs.  One result of Hash Graph is that it can only work with a relatively small number of nodes, meaning it can't just run in the wild with any number of nodes.  So it's a private only platform like IBM hyperledger, or even the JP Morgan Quorum ( private, Ethereum based ).  Understand that the economics is different between private and public environments.  When one of these distributed ledgers runs in a private environment, its security is incentivized by authoritarian means.  For example: private banks whose identities are known are running the validation nodes so if they decide to collude or cheat you can take away their banking licenses or punish them in some way.  Private = consensus and security are incentivized by authoritarian means.  On the other hand, in public environment the identities of the validators are not known, it's anonymous and permissionless as anyone around the world can join at any time and participate.  This is a much more complicated (and free) scenario that incentivizes consensus and security through *economic means* and game theory.  Anonymous validators will win economic rewards for participating in the security of the chain, and in some designs they can even lose their money if they misbehave.  Pubic/Permissionless = consensus and security incentivized by economic value.  This is why the public networks (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) have tokens of economic value because they are needed for incentivization of security in a permissionless non-authoritarian environment.  A private ledger project like Hash Graph where all nodes identities are known can of course achieve higher performance than a public chain, but it's also subject to secret manipulation or infiltration by state or other entities which have greater access the more centralized components of the system, who can identify, regulate and otherwise coerce the participants and in the worst possible case, control what is "true" in the system.  Almost all of these projects which claim to be way faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum have cut corners in their design and have introduced some level of centralization into the system.  The point of Bitcoin and Ethereum and most of the other public projects are to achieve and maintain decentralization of power which is the very promise of this movement... not to revert back into some centralized system once again.  There is ongoing research on how to scale the public networks over time so that they can maintain true decentralization while achieving higher performance for all to use.

There appears to be an incentive in the Bitcoin system to make sending transactions dangerous (in the sense that they might not go through right away) so that everyone bids up fees in order to stay safe from having their transaction sidelined.  On the other side everyone obviously has the incentive to try to pay the lowest fee possible instead of overpaying.  This state of affairs is ridiculous.

Networks like EOS that sacrifice security and decentralization for some temporary performance and hype \(it will run on only 21 master nodes or something like that\) will eventually just succumb to centralization forces and become no different than existing centralized Web 2.0 platforms.
The way forward for Web 3.0 is for base protocols to be truly decentralized and have sovereign\-grade censorship resistance.  Applications that are then built on top of these protocols can introduce centralization as needed/desired at the application layer.

Something needs to be made very clear:  Nothing is ever backed by anything tangible.  Things can only be backed by the promises of trusted third parties who promise to provide the promised backing.  Lots of promises.
Everyone thinks currency backing looks something like this, for example:
-is backed by-
...But actually it always looks like this:
-is backed by-
Trusted Third Party
-who promises to provide-
Bitcoin/crypto negates the need for both the trusted third party and any backing.
Anytime anyone says something like "currency is backed by xyz" you call bullshit.  It's only ever backed by promises.  In the beginning those promises are made good.  When the going gets tough those promise are always reneged.  It's called history.  Until Math.  When Bitcoin wrote a new history for the shallow and frail human kind.

James DeAngelo of World Bitcoin Network produced the [most amazing analysis]( of our current voting system I have ever come across and I really think the whole country should watch it.  He comes to the conclusion that we cannot use crypto for election naively; we must use the secret ballot in order to have fair elections.  I think there is a place for crypto in voting, but we must preserve the protections that the secret ballot gives us against intimidation and vote buying/selling.
Edit:  I should also mention his major conclusion in the video:  The secret ballot is missing in the heart of our democracy, congress, which is now open to intimidation and vote buying/selling.  This explains so much of what has gone wrong with our country since the 70s when they changed some of the congressional voting procedures and removed the secret ballot.

This doesn't make sense.  The "market cap" of XRP as is normally conceived and is probably the "market cap" being referred to in the question, is &lt;circulating coins&gt; * &lt;price per coin&gt;.

The "market cap" you are referring of &lt;total coins&gt; * &lt;price per coin&gt; puts XRP and significantly higher that BTC and XRP takes the number one spot:

Since Bitcoin is digital, newbies tend to think that you should be able to provide exact change.  For example if something costs 1.234 Bitcoins, then why not just type in 1.234 in your wallet and send that exact amount?  After it's just digital right?
Well, it doesn't work that way.  Bitcoin has "inputs" and "outputs" which are kind of like "bills... like "dollar bills" or "ten dollar bills".  Since this is the case, then change will almost always be needed because you can rarely provide the exact amount owed with the "bill" sizes you have in your wallet, just as you're used to when using dollars.  Bitcoin does not, however, have fixed denominations like the USD does (100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 1, quarter, dime, nickel, penny).  Instead it has outputs from previous transactions and they can be of any size/value.  Here is a loose example:  Imagine you have a wallet with two "bills" in it: one is a $1.44 bill, another is a $8.31 bill.  If you need to pay for something that costs, say $9.01, then you would need to pull out both bills (which combined are equal to 8.31+1.44=9.75) and give them to the merchant.  The merchant then takes the two bills worth $9.75 and subtracts the cost of $9.01 and your change is $0.74.  The merchant hands you one $0.74 bill which you put in your wallet and walk away.  Bitcoin provides magic cash registers that mint a brand new bill for the exact amount of change for each transaction, which is why your wallet keeps being filled with odd sized "bills"... which you then spend and the cycle continues.
By default, Bitcoin clients will receive this change "bill" in a newly created "change address" in the wallet.  You need to keep track of change addresses... they are addresses just like any other address that contain Bitcoins just like any other address.  The Bitcoin designers think creating new addresses for change is a good idea for privacy and what not.  It sure does create a lot of confusion though.  Apparently your wallet will take care of it automatically.  
One case where you really run into a problem is with paper wallets.  When you go to spend your paper wallet, if you don't spend it all then, since it's paper and not programmatic, it can't create a change address, so the change that you would normally get back goes to the minor as a reward I believe and you would lose the change forever. I'm not sure why it should work this way but that is what I've read.  You would think that if a change address was not provided that the protocol would return the change to the sending address, but I guess it does not work that way... maybe someone else can comment on this piece.

I think this helps the problem immensely:
from 
Multi-signature to protect against theft
Bitcoin includes a multi-signature feature that allows a transaction to require the signature of more than one private key to be spent. It is currently only usable for technical users but a greater availability for this feature can be expected in the future. Multi-signature can, for example, allow an organization to give access to its treasury to its members while only allowing a withdrawal if 3 of 5 members sign the transaction. It can also allow future online wallets to share a multi-signature address with their users, so that a thief would need to compromise both your computer and the online wallet servers in order to steal your funds.

If Bitcoin follows an S curve adoption, then there will be a period of volatility during a phase of price discovery.

Here is another thing that Peter Schiff does not understand:  
Just because there can be Bitcoin "copies" or "altcoins" doesn't mean the supply is diluted.  Schiff made the argument that because altcoins can be created it dilutes the value of Bitcoin in the way that fiat currencies are diluted.  This is false.  
First of all, to all the idiots out there, CRYPTOCURRENCIES ARE NOT FIAT CURRENCIES, so shut up and stop lying.  Fiat currencies are currencies that are declared by State Decree and when they are not backed by anything the supply can be diluted with infinite printing.  Bitcoin is a completely voluntary, spontaneous and organic phenomenon.  Not only has no one every "decreed" anything about Bitcoin, but it's decentralized and no one controls and it's supply is limited by the protocol.
Secondly, with that out of the way, imagine for simplicity that you have a world with just two crypto currencies, Bitcoin and Litecoin.  Bitcoin has a market cap of $10 billion and Litecoin $1 billion.  If Litecoin goes up to 2 Billion, did that "dilute" the value of Bitcoin?  NO IT DIDN'T PETER SCHIFF.  Now the overall market cap of all cryptocurrencies is 12 billion instead of 11 billion.  So what?  If anything, in this example, Bitcoin only became less volatile.  Each cryptocurrency has it's own integrity and each cryptocurrency's supply is defined/limited or constant.  There is never any diluting of the currency.  You can still place $100 worth of value into Bitcoin or Litecoin, and transmit it across the world and it's still $100 worth.  And if one is concerned with the price of Bitcoin decreasing due to people selling Bitcoin into altcoins, there is nothing stopping anyone from owning a basket of cryptocurrencies, which would hedge against price fluctuations.  
Peter really needs to do some thinking before he spouts specious arguments.  Too late I guess.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:30:37
Just to confirm, I also believe this is correct.  Technically the protocol only subdivides to 100 millionths, but if the need ever arose the protocol could and would easy be changed by global consensus as bbbbbubble said.  So other crypto currencies that claim things like "we make 4x the amount as bitcoin" and this it's somehow better, they are lying.  I'm not saying other cryptos don't have some interesting features that could potentially overtake Bitcoin, only that the 21 million limit set by Bitcoin is not a problem.
