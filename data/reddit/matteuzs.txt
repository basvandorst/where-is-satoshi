Microsoft **is** an exploit.

Conspiracy or not:   
  
  
CNY 7%, USD 87%.  
  
edit:  
An other view:   
USD volume: 78%, CNY volume: 13%.
  
  
Atm we dump more than them ?
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:55:03
Good point, should that mean it's easier for them to get an higher daily volume ? So the volume is less revealant ?  
The most important is the number of $$/CNY we're putting in, right ?  
I'll try to find some numbers.

This made my day, maybe my week.

edit: I think we should. I'm missing experience to conclude anything. I would get the opinion of others.

I would change the title to avoid confusion, but I can't :/

It's not about an exclusion.  
I don't want to exclude China from the business, I don't want to see the China government ban Bitcoin or so.  
I just think we have a better buy power and more money involved and I don't understand why we are following them so closely. It's not helping them to strictly follow the move.  
  
This is how we follow.

I'm from Europa, but trading with USD. I think most of us doing so.

Sure, but I'm not donating to them.
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:55:01
On a short timestamp. Whatever, I need my daily bad news now, starting to be addict.
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:22:17
No no, we know it's impossible.  
I mean by 'detach' to letting'em going down if they want.  
Of course if China climb down, the price will do so everywhere.  
The thing I don't understand is it look we have more buy power (more money ?) than them so far, but we are following them very closely to the ground when they go for it.  
  
  
(it's very hard to find more data for Huobi :/)
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:08:28
Indeed, but isn't arbitrage creating an 'average' of the both prices ? As I said to h1d, it's not helping them to strictly follow the move.
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:09:02
When this should start ?
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:11:25
Nice find !  
This reinforcing my feeling that we have more power than China in Bitcoin at the moment and we shouldn't follow them as we do.

Thanks for pointing this. I did investigate on this to find why Huobi volume isn't shown on the main charts.  
I found this:  
  
  
I have no idea of what to think.  
I'm not saying that the China volume is small, just watching the chart and trying to understand why we (=no chineses) following them so closely.  
I would to see the reverse happening.
