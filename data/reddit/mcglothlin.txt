You should maybe read more about what happened during the financial recession. The problem was not centrally about deposits and would be fairly easy to regulate if we tried. Besides which, the FDIC insures deposits. You're at best describing the start of the Great Depression but a **whole** lot has changed in the financial system since then.

This is, frankly, self-serving delusion. Plenty of people bought Beanie Babies to get rich but that didn't exactly do anything to make them a monetary standard.

That is an impressively bad analogy. People started using Craigslist for *classified ads* because they were a better and cheaper form of classified ads than previously available through newspapers. That directly competed with newspapers because they were offering the exact same product. People buying bitcoin *as a speculative investment*, i.e. gambling, has no effect on other currencies *as money* because almost no one is using Bitcoin as money.

I mean that only goes against basically all of human economic history but it fits in with Libertarian fantasy philosophy so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
People aren't hyper-rational financial planners and "gold standard only harder" won't suddenly change that, it will just make the regularly occurring financial crises that preceded the abandonment of the gold standard during the Great Depression look nice by comparison. 
Of course, that's assuming you could actually get everyone using one crypto-currency with a fixed supply, but given how easy it is to create new ones we'd really just return to what we had before there was a standardized US currency which is a whole other terrible ball of wax. 
Seriously, a world where crypto-currencies replace fiat currency would be *a disaster*. People who think they've got One Simple Solution! to all economic/government/whatever problems probably just need to read more.

What? No one in the thread you're replying to said crypto isn't a currency. They said it's a bad one. You can create your own currency if you want but it will also be bad.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:49:44
Which is still irrelevant to the fact that people gambling on *any* cryptocurrency and never using it *as currency* doesn't do anything at all to make it a monetary standard.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:08:13
Irrelevant to the fact that people buying BTC doesn't make it useful as money. Half the country could gamble on Bitcoin but if it costs $20 to buy a cup of coffee and no coffee shops accept it anyway it hasn't gotten anywhere closer to being a monetary standard.

LOL @ mental gymnastics. Buddy. I'll try to make it super clear for you.
Craigslist hurt newspapers because it provides a service newspapers depended on except for free. It hurt them because the product was a direct substitute. People had to pay newspapers for that product and suddenly they could get it online for free.
People are buying Bitcoin as a gamble because they think it will make them money, the same way they do trendy stocks, gold depending on the market, houses during the inflation of a bubble, and beanie babies before everyone realized they were a fad. If conditions change to make Bitcoin more attractive *as a currency* than USD or whatever then it will start to become a monetary standard but lots of people *having it* does nothing to make that happen.
Bitcoin is not being used in place of money the way Craigslist was used in place of newspaper classifieds, it's being used a speculative investment in the same way as Beanie Babies.

Seriously, please read *anything* about the 2008 collapse. The problem was not deposit-holding banks making too many loans. It was that mortgage issuers (mostly not deposit banks!) were able to slice them up and sell them as overrated investment assets which other institutions then also placed insurance/bets on. This is why the bailouts didn't go through the FDIC. Fractional reserve banking wasn't the cause of the recession and cryptocurrencies wouldn't have prevented it. Shit, a bunch of people putting tons of money into crypto thinking it has some inherent value is more comparable to the cause of the recession if anything.

Bank runs were peripheral to the 2008 collapse. You could recreate that crash just fine in a bitcoin-based economy in fact. Here you go:
I, a person with a whole lot of BTC (i.e. a financial institution), lend all of my BTC out to people as mortgages that I know are very risky. I don't want to hold on that risk so I slice these mortgages up and repackage them as supposedly investment-grade assets using a corrupt relationship with rating agencies to get them labeled as safe. I then sell them to various people and institutions who want investment assets to get back all of my bitcoin plus profit. The people I sold those assets to (but also others because boo government, regulation suxx) take out insurance policies on those assets a hedge/bet. When the original borrowers aren't able to pay their mortgages all of the institutions that bought large amounts of my baloney investment assets and the institutions that insured them will be screwed and a ton of people will get foreclosed on or end up underwater on their mortgages, only now the government won't be able to do countercyclical fiscal policy providing unemployment insurance payouts or stimulus projects. None of this requires fractional reserve banking to be possible and is in fact all more likely in a decentralized, unregulated financial system.

To 'buy' fiat? You can keep cash under your mattress if you want, but there are a few downsides to that, kind of like with bitcoin which people in this sub seem to rediscover daily.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:05:24
You're still not following. I don't have to lend out more than I have in reserve because I sold off the mortgages as securitized assets and have gotten all my money back. You can still have a system that allows a huge amount of bad investments that a lot of players in the system don't know are bad and that can still fuck up the entire economy.

It's a market free _from government intervention_ anyway, and as a currency it's a complete disaster for an average user, which is why crypto will never replace government currencies for the vast majority of people.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:26:14
Are you saying some kinds of government regulation are good and necessary? Very strange idea.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:12:56
I thought Bitcoin was the currency of the future. Why shouldn't everyone be in it? Sounds more like a speculative commodity.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:36:53
Weird that it's the currency of the future but you still have to use dollars to compare value. ��
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:13:47
Not a Scotsman from what I've heard either.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:27:29
Well, Bitcoin enthusiasts seem predominantly libertarian and complete ignorance of real world complexity is pretty par for the course there.

Sure, if I'm starving in Venezuela what I really want is internet gold that takes hours and $30 per transaction to spend.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:29:12
Dude, you realize there was in fact a period before antitrust law and a reason it was created, yeah?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:25:15
Uh, government regulation is not the biggest barrier to entering the broadband ISP market.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:45:20
LOL. Yes, a handful of speculators who happened to get in at the right time and live in Venezuela is truly revolutionary. If it's changed their lives it's probably because they cashed out for USD and are using it to actually buy things they need.
@_date: 2018-08-07 15:12:12
Not really. A business dealing with a volatile form of payment has to make sure that cuts only one way or they go out of business, so you'd undoubtedly see sizable transaction fees to use it.
@_date: 2018-08-07 14:59:48
Not long term but that's not really what currencies are for either.
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:07:37
It's almost like inherently deflationary currencies don't work very well.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:28:31
That's because US banks are dumb (and under-regulated). A look at European banks shows the problem is not technological.
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:00:34
There's a maximum limit to the supply of Bitcoin. Evangelists usually cite it as a good thing. If the economy grows and/or population increases the same amount of currency has to represent more value. That's not static, it's deflationary. 
People *say* Bitcoin is a currency but it's difficult to use as one and encourages speculation ("investment").
