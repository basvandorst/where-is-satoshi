Thanks for supporting Tor without annoying captchas and having to run scripts from companies you don't trust.
I haven't registered yet because it seems to require a phone number which I don't think should be necessary - Surely 2FA should be optional (or at least offer another easy to implement form that has an open source client like gnupg). It is possible to not want to bother with 2FA while still being conscious of the security implications of not using it - just write into the TOS something like "You sign up and we're not responsible", perhaps.  Hell, that's probably already in there, but I wouldn't know, because of problem  I just encountered:
I haven't seen the inside yet obviously, but I already see that JS may be a problem here, I am not running scripts in my browser and I can't see anything on a few of the public pages.  How about some graceful degredation?
This site sounds really awesome in concept, and even if there were small transactionn fees for the end that vends a product or offers a service.  Seems pretty cool, I definitely want to check it out!

Indeed, must be a ton, I hope it's secure!

Cert &amp; redirection issues.

Money has traditionally had 4 characteristics:
1) durability
2) divisibility
3) transportability
4) noncounterfeitability
Bitcoin has all these properties.  Aditionally, if you look at gold for instance, people chose it as money partially because it already had value in, and was prevalent in society for other reasons - similar to bitcoin's network effect.
Bitcoin's coin and it's network/clearing system are interdependent and pretty novel, there is no real parallel from the past.

This is a great article like most of Justus' stuff!
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:57:11
Because this is a few months old by now?  Oh yeah, and there's a bunch of lame-o anti-Bitcoiners that love to wage propaganda wars as if a bunch of post-teens who grew up in the tech age know anything about the design properties of functional money.

It seems the consensus is that we must build layers on top.  JoinMarket is a great step forward, and maybe ring signatures (like implemented in Monero) will eventually make their way into BTC somehow, but for now focus is on layers on top until one of those tech's like sidechains may effectively enable privacy.

FYI your https:// site has a lot of issues...
@_date: 2016-01-02 00:35:27
Yes it does, and so does

BitMixer, why don't you force 301 redirects to https:// on http:// requests?
Not that that might necessarily help in this situation since the exit node could stop the 301 code from coming through, but seriously, why would ANYONE want or need to use that site without HTTPS:// ??  It seems basic!!
@_date: 2016-02-05 06:32:59
This really sucks hard and more people need to be aware of this.  It makes me laugh when you visit a mixer site that uses cloudflare!
@_date: 2016-02-04 04:28:35
apparently colored coin blockchains
@_date: 2016-02-05 21:03:56
It actually turns out that the one being retards as usual are CLOUDLFARE and/or their clients - they don't redirect you to HTTPS:// until you solve the captcha (if you're on TOR).
@_date: 2016-02-04 05:43:23
Only if your browser doesn't handle certificates and checking certificates correctly... or there's a hole in some part of your browser or the server you're talking to that the mitm would have exploit.
@_date: 2016-02-04 06:19:41
Cool, so this is going on live for a wide swath of us ... should be easy to find the exit node(s).
@_date: 2016-02-04 23:14:11
Nice find... they could at least use someone else's api besides bci's if they're not going to use their own!
@_date: 2016-02-04 05:42:08
Use end-to-end encryption like https:// or .onion link, etc

It seems coinomi is a btc &amp; altcoin wallet with shapeshift built in, so you can instantly exchange any coin shapeshift supports with any other coin they support.
In other words, mixing for low fees... having to trust a 3rd party temporarily.
Any other practical applications for this?
@_date: 2016-02-04 05:44:44
Lol like I wanna mix my coins with someone who uses cloudflare... you out yo damn mind!
@_date: 2016-02-04 05:40:52
There's a cool plugin that goes great with HTTPS Everywhere as well that will check every http: request for https:// presence, offer to redirect you there, then once you're there, you can tell it to save the redirect rule for all time to HTTPS Everywhere.  It's called HTTPS-Finder:

Yeah, but can one actually send to any arbitrary SWIFT address with it?  That is what OP is seeking.

In that post on the bitcoin forum, when you click the "who's onboard" link, the bitcoinxt.software site claims BLOCKCHAIN.INFO is the "most trusted brand in Bitcoin".

Glad the talking heads on CBNC are able to confidently report on the matter!

His problem is he forgot to fire one up before posting.
@_date: 2015-11-30 21:34:51
You act like he's a public official and has some duty.  He's a private individual and he can have and espouse whatever crazy ideas he wants!
