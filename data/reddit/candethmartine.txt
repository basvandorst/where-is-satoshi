I have no idea. Nobody does. It could fail for any number of reasons. If you truly think that anything cannot fail (IE there are no scenarios in which it does not succeed) you need to step back before you endanger your well being. 
Yes, the US government probably won't fail. But it might.

canceling orders most likely, or just taking down listings. it's not like someone ordering is a legally enforceable contract :P

If everyone thought like you this wouldn't have happened. Even the 'true believers' here are obsessed with BTC value in USD/EUR when at the end of the day it shouldn't matter. At some point *whatever it is* it'll stabilize, which is more of the "end game" that people like you are aiming for. It's not about how much money you can make.

It either completely fails, or it does not.

You need to remove politics from your investing. Not all trading is the subprime mortgage crisis, there are patterns that generally ring true in the trading industry.
**Yes** lots of them are shitheads but this guy giving you advice has nothing to do with the corporate board of Goldmann

The somewhat good news is that wealth is relative. most people are young and don't have a lot of money, and hopefully nobody has put others in jeopardy with their trading. (though I know some have)
Young people can take big risks &amp; afford to come up empty. They're young. So even if someone loses 5 grand, yes even if it was their entire "net worth" it's really nothing overall. I'm sad for the people who will lose assets and be unable to pay bills and provide for family members though :\

In the same paragraph they talk about it as a stable way to exchange money and as a commodity you can speculate on. O_O
That's fucking scary.

While I'm clearly quoting that fairly lame joke, it's kind of true for this. nobody has any friggin clue and the people you should *least* believe are the people claiming they do.

Bitcoin's only value is that people are willing to trade it for other currencies. That will eventually stop happening.

Every single "thing" that's ever been a bubble looks like this chart. See the front page of this thread regarding the .com bubble. 
All bubbles look like this. Bubbles mean nothing about the product. Gold is still real &amp; valuable, internet stocks still exist, but that doesn't mean that it wasn't a bubble. 
It's possible that BTC will rise again, but understand that you are gambling, nothing more.

As someone who doesn't give a shit and has no anger at someone else's success - congrats. That's life changing (well, depends on your initial net wealth!)
