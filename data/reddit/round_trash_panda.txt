When I get paid I see the percentage taken out that is sent to the Bitwage account. That day or the next day I will see that dollar amount in the Bitwage app. Usually 12-24hours after I see that money in the account I'll see the bitcoins that were purchased. They are forwarded to whatever address I send them. I've even sent a few receive addresses so they are always different. 
The process works, it's a little slow. I'm still not to the point where I'd let it go without watching every step. Realistically I don't think I'd ever get to that point. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 20:21:42
I gave a note to my employer and told them put X percent into this account (Bitwage). Then told them to put the remaining balance into Y account. The 50, 50 split is how you can split further what's in X account. If I want to change my percentages I'll go to my employer. I haven't tried splitting what goes into X account, I receive that in Bitcoin.

I too had trouble getting signed up for Bitwage. Problems with IDs not being sufficient and their live chat being anything but live or chat. I was only able to reach them through email and it was infuriating. I was on the vurge of dropping them entirely. I also felt that I had given them enough personal information to commit identity theft 7 times over. 
   In the end everything finally went through and I'm now receiving Bitcoin for pay. While I'm happy it finally works, They seem to only shop the markets when the price is high. I don't know if I'll be keeping the service or not.

2FA is vulnerable to social engineering exploits. All one needs to know is your name and your phone number. This then locks you out of your own 2FA accounts. Sure a FIDO key solves this but that now we're back to carrying a piece of hardware. Your phone is a piece of hardware as well.

Write down your 24 word seed. Transfer a small amount to it. Wipe the device. I put your 24 words and see if the coin is there. You'll now have piece of mind that you have your words written correctly and can restore from them. I didn't do this initially and purchased a 2nd nano to restore to just be sure. You'll sleep better knowing for sure the seed is correct. Then I suggest getting a cryptosteel and repeating the restore procedure. Keep the cryptosteel in a secure location and carry on.

Load tails onto a USB thumb drive. Not as simple as just placing the file on the USB, it has to be bootable. It's an OS not a browser. It uses RAM rather than hard drive to operate.

No. you would still use windows as normal. 
To use tails on USB you'd do the following.
When you boot, you'd hit delete, F8, ESC or whatever to get into your bios settings. You would then set boot priority to the removable USB drive. 
Install USB drive, then exit with save. It should then boot for you into tails. Once on tails use electrum which is already installed. Or make your paper wallet. When you shut down your RAM is wiped and you can reboot into windows as normal.

This is essentially the same as if I told you "Don't drive that new car you just bought. Your depreciating it and that hurts the next buyer." If you buy it/mine it do as you please with it, it's yours.
HODLing decreases volatility which will drag more of the wary into the tech. More people who are in it will help develop plans and ideas to take it many steps forward. If it becomes more stable and more people are into the space, more retailers will want to be in the space.

Did you expect Coinbase to have a low transaction fee to go along with their other higher than normal fees? This is likely the wallet they use to send coins from not updating to the lower levels that are available. I've seen some very very low fees go through in very short times lately.

Your method for paper wallets works, but has many security holes. It's best to use a clean os, or one that wipes itself after use (tails is great for this). The info could still be on your machine and malware could find it once reconnected to net.

Security holes - Anything that has had connections to the net can likely have malware/virus. Use a fresh install. Connecting to the net after creating wallet without wiping the OS allows future virus/malware to search your machine for any private keys.
Multisig - things like two factor authorization and or multiple devices are needed to send a transaction. If someone gains access to your electrum and have your password, they may still need a phone or a tablet of yours to ok a send from the wallet. 
For paper wallet you can do this as well using a password to encrypt your private key. This is great cause you can create multiple copies of the paper wallet and store them in multiple locations.

This depends. 
How securely was the paper wallet created? Vs. how virus ridden is the computer? Are you storing long term or storing with intention of using some?
Paper wallet is fine for long term storage so long as it is created on a secure machine with printer that doesn't connect to internet. Electrum on PC is decent for holding/spending some, use multi sig. 
A hardware wallet is the best way currently to have the benefits of a paper wallet and the usability of a PC wallet.

I'm not familiar with electrons UI for messages. I know a little about pgp encryption. You would essentially have someone encrypt a message to you using your public key. Once receiving this message you would decrypt it using your
Private key.

You will have coins on both chains regardless of which node they point you to. Set your own node for bitcoin, and 2x for their node.

“For people who try to avoid tax and money laundering, bitcoin is ideal.” 
“Personal Swiss bank”
I feel like you should lay off the news for a little while. Cash is the idea drug money. It’s been this way for years. Why do you think there is a push to start phasing out cash. (Looking at you India). Leaving a paper trail for the IRS to find you usually is a bad idea for money laundering, therefore leaving a permanent transaction on a ledger stored in over 9000 location would be an even worse idea. Feeding into the “it’s only for criminals” is part of of the failed attempts to discredit Bitcoin. Touting them now as Bitcoin nears 10k is just regurgitating news from 2013. We’re these purchases done with Bitcoin?, sure, and the same with every other currency on the planet.

Flawed logic. Market cap while currently 138.4 billion is a poor reflection of the amount of dollars put into it. Market cap doesn’t account for lost coins and yet does include coins that haven’t been mined yet. I’m suggesting the market cap at $200,000 per coin would be closer to 2.2 trillion. I get this from taking 16 million coins, subtracting 5 million lost coins and then multiplying $200,000 per coin. I think this is a bit more realistic of a number.

Cryptosteel is a well built item. It's expensive but so is the material to build it. By the time you pay a machinist for what you want labor, material and invest your own time completing the remaining pieces you'll be in a similar price range.

Very interesting take. I’m thinking people will always need some form of income if they aren’t some of the whales we have today. These will be the people creating value to grow their value. It may become a thing to only have to work 10 or 20 years to amass enough wealth to enjoy life. As for the whales, they will spend this wealth on houses, cars, and travel. It will be interesting to see just where this goes. I can’t really think of anything that has such a known finite supply.

You set node to prune as you download it. Basically the node checks addresses before deleting the irrelevant information to its own coins. If there are no coins it delete most of the blocks. If you are not using it to store coins it’s not helping anyone.

If you control the keys then it doesn't matter what they allow. They will point you to a 2x node. You won't see or be able to spend your bitcoin. Your bitcoin are still there. Once the fork happens a wallet provider will come out with a split function. You import your keys to that wallet and split your coins.

It will be less volatile because the whales will not be able to move the market as easily as they do today. Couple this with heightened trust in the coin which you can already see happening. That last dip we had from $7500 down to $5500 recovered the next day.

No price cap. There's a cap on the amount of coins. This forces the value to rise with increased demand and lost coins.

Get the copay app. Get your coins off Coinbase and into said app. Write down your 12 word seed and remember it. Store it in a few safe locations. Then link your Bitpay card to your copay wallet. You'll then be able to transfer to it easily.

Use their wallet, it's pretty nice and you don't need to download the block chain to use your coins.
Private key is the first thing you do when you get the device. Write it down as the device will never display this info again. 
When you disconnect, just unplug it. This will disconnect the wallet to the normal log in screen. It's quite nice as you can do it in a panic and not worry about anything

Breadwallet. It allows you to select what node you want. Follow all wallets on twitter and Reddit to find out what to do once the fork hits. Within a few days 1 or two of them will have a way to split. Once you know what wallet, import your keys, split and move your coins as you see fit.

It makes plenty of sense. If internet providers move to block bitcoin we still can relay transactions using steganography. I mentioned the photo of cats that contained a bitcoin transaction. Internet providers wouldn’t move to block cat photos would they? There are many ways of getting transactions through and breaking the net neutrality laws isn’t going to stop bitcoin.

It's the idea choice if you make it on a non internet connected machine and plan on holding it on there. If you sweep it, make sure to sweep all the funds off it. Keeping the private key safe from fire, theft, water damage, paper breaking down over time are also some concerns to be aware of.

China had banned Google, Facebook, and Twitter, should these have crashed and burned too?
Governments will have as much success banning the English language, math, and gravity.
All banning something does is relinquish all control over it and push it underground.
It's banned in Venezuela. People there are risking life in prison but still mine and transact with it. They use socialism against itself by mining with the free electricity provided to them. The coins are used to buy merchandise and food that are then smuggled in, which is also banned. Should we fly out there and tell them this should be crashing and burning?

1800 coins a day are mined. This drops to 900 per day. If there are the same number of people buying the same number of coin the price has to double. There are other factors involved though. Price goes up so more people will sell and add to available coins. This is also counteracted with more people being introduced to the market. Price will rise, not double and not immediately.

Coinbase has 10 million customers, what's going to happen to pricing when they all want one coin?

Anything over $10,000 moved in a bank is an automatic IRS notification. They even look for say 3 $9,500 moves, this is called structuring. 
Seeing this deposit they will check on you to see if you owe any back taxes and take them if so. They will likely flag you for a check to make sure you pay gains on that deposit at the end of the year.

I recall hearing about this on the Joe Rogan Podcast with Andreas Antonopolus. There are 4 of them to my knowledge and are 2-3 hours long each. I can't say with any certainty which one it is. What I can say is listen to all 4 of them in order. The first one is fantastic. Joe is totally skeptical of bitcoin and you can hear his disgust during the show. During the show you can feel his wheels turning and he becomes interested in it. By the end of the show he is into it, and realizes it's potential. There was also a time when Andreas set him up with a wallet and the public filled it. It was fasinating hearing Joes elation that people funneled money into this wallet just by showing a QR code. He said he would double and dontate this money. Not sure if he donated cash or lost his seed (wallet was still full last I checked).

If you want something, you buy it. You won't feel bad that the coin is worth more after the sale, if you enjoy what you have bought. This will give a slight push to buy quality things. It will slow the junk that is built and dwindle our consumerism to something more reasonable. Merchants will be rewarded for selling quality items buy keeping the bitcoin rather than selling to fiat. This will prompt them to give discounts for items sold with it. This will grow the economy. The larger the economy grows, the less volatile it becomes.

Bitcoin is war. It's consistently under attack. If it weren't as valuable as it is it would be ignored. It has the potential to crush banking as we know it. The banks know this and are scared.

For those that don't know Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a fraud a month ago. We had nearly hit $5000. At that time China said they were banning ICOs. It followed with Jamie's statement (which I believe didn't have quite the impact most think it did). China then continued to ban all things crypto except for mining. We have since crawled back to nearly $5000. Therefor this user placing an order for nearly $5000 is a bold fuck you to both Jamie (the real fraud) and China. Thus, my opening line.

Beware, a stop loss can burn you.
You need a buyer for it to trigger, if there are no buyers in a free fall it won't trigger. Price falls, eventually bottoms and it triggers. Cue the trend reversal and now you've just bought high and sold low. Now you need to get back into the market. 
There is also the time it triggers at your set point but the reversal happens a few dollars under that point. The trend reverses and you now have no coins and price is above where it was when you set that stop loss.

There isn't an issue, that's the thing.
A few months ago people/bots were spamming the network with ultra low fee transactions. This filled mempools and then created higher fees. The fees were exacerbated by shitty wallet fee algorithms. This caused the need for a scaling "fix". One side created their own coin with larger blocks (bcash). The other side (core) rolled out segwit. Large blocks were never really tested, while segwit was tested on the test net for a while. During this debate time (which was a bit of a stalemate) a 3rd camp decided to have a backdoor meeting to enact segwit but to include a block size increase. There was another camp that decided to create a user activated soft fork UASF. This ultimatly forced the change to upgrade to Segwit. 
Segwit was working great but that wasn't enough bcash forked off with their own coin. This bcash coin isn't doing what they had hoped, never has had full blocks and has become a tool to suck money from users. The Segwit2x camp is still planning to go through with the fork. They want to go through with it to get rid of the core developers. It will be a centralized coin. If you follow the actors you will see most of them have ties with MasterCard and one with the Federal Reserve as I've read. This Segwit2x is nothing more than an attack on Bitcoin. I can't seem to find a reason we need it, nor a positive reason for it to continue. Core has implemented steps to block Segwit2x nodes. Segwit2x has taken steps to obscure its node from being easily destinguished from cores block. This act should say all that needs to be said.

From the r/Bitcoin front page
apoefjmqdsfls 219 pts 7h In the case of two chains, Bitfinex will list the Segwit2X fork as 'B2X', and the real bitcoin as 'BTC'.
You can read it on their new T+Cs about the segwit2x CSTs
1.1“BT1” means a CST representing the Incumbent Bitcoin Blockchain;
1.2“BT2” means a CST representing Segwit2x consensus protocol;
1.3“B2X” means a Digital Token converted from BT2s at or after Contract Settlement, as set out in these T&amp;amp;Cs;
1.8“Incumbent Blockchain” means the currently existing Bitcoin blockchain that is exclusively used based on the consensus protocol as set out from time to time in the repository 
1.9“Segwit2x” means the anticipated Bitcoin blockchain that will be exclusively used based on the consensus protocol as set out from time to time in the repository 
3.Settlement—Generally &amp;amp; BT1s: At Contract Settlement, CSTs shall be converted on a 1:1 basis to Digital Tokens on their respective blockchains at Contract Settlement. In the case of BT1, the blockchain shall be defined by the consensus rules used on the Incumbent Blockchain, currently designated with the ticker symbol BTC. If no Incumbent Blockchain exists pursuant to these T+Cs, BT1 tokens shall be deemed to have a value equal to zero and shall be removed from the platform. All open orders for any BT1 trading pair will be canceled at Contract Settlement.
4.Settlement—BT2s: In the case of BT2, Segwit2x shall be deemed to exist only if a blockchain has diverged incompatibly from the Incumbent Blockchain. Any settlements of BT2 shall be to B2X. If no Segwit2x blockchain exists pursuant to these T+Cs, BT2 tokens shall be deemed to have a value equal to zero and shall be removed from the platform. All open orders for any BT2 trading pair will be converted into open orders for corresponding B2X trading pairs to ensure pricing continuity and minimize disruption for users trading BTC pairs on leverage prior to the Chain Split Event.

Just to clarify some of your terms, Segwit is not bad, Segwit2x is bad.
Segwit2x is a proposed "upgrade" to Bitcoin. This "upgrade" was derived from a closed door agreement between people who want to control Bitcoin. There is no consensus among users to implement Segwit2x so it will just create another altcoin or fizzle away to nothing.

Ive heard it said that even when caring for your own parents it's ok to ask for compensation. If someone is doing a job and getting paid for it, why should you do the same unpaid? I don't know the circumstances of your situation. I'm not trying to pry them from you and it's none of my business. I know it can be a tough conversation to say to someone you have x arrangement with that you need some form of compensation. Your acting as an investment broker, a security analyst, and a research team. These are all paid positions even if I've improperly named them.
Asking to be paid for the above work is my reasoning for saying good luck. Sorry it carries a sub-communication, it wasn't meant to.
I too act in these positions for a few people who otherwise didn't know about crypto. I'm grateful they understand what I do for them and try to pull their own weight. I don't ask to be paid but if I walk away I would feel responsible. 
Your position sounds similar but different than mine. I don't have direct advice but hoping the above will spark something.
The reason I do what I do is lead by the comments of "I invested x and now it's worth y in a very short time" x&lt;y.

It's very easy to spoof 2FA that use text messages. I'm extremely surprised any IT department continues to allow this type of 2FA. 
Basically just get a phone number and call cell services posing as a phone store with the owner of the phone. Call back if you get a no. Some rep will do it.

I want to own a bitcoin!

My order sat for weeks. They eventually shipped it. My guess is high demand is high. They make them and ship them out when once ready.

10% of the posts in this forum are of Coinbase closing accounts. People continue to use them. It's becoming comical.

You may have a easier time selling for fiat and converting to bitcoin later. Your looking for a very specific buyer. Someone who wants your property.
Someone who will pay for your property.
Someone with funds or credit to buy your property. 
Someone with bitcoin.
Tough, I wish you luck. I really hope you can find said buyer with bitcoin.

Running pruned is good only for you as it deletes all the data that doesn't pertain to your coins. Running full copy helps the entire network.

I don't know the answers to these two questions. My guess about organization is if your using it for a business, which it sounds like your not. As for Canada, bitpay website says world wide, where ever visa debit is accepted.

Hybrid cars have more parts. More parts usually mean more broken parts. Full electric cars would be better. Less parts than a gasoline vehicle.
@_date: 2016-07-08 21:55:56
You maybe could let it run for a few weeks mining, you could possibly make a few pennies. These pennies would help pay the multi dollar electric bill you will rack up. 
I tried mining 3-4 years ago with a i7, made maybe $6 in the booms prices.

That seed works across any BIP 39 active wallet. So pretty much any of the active wallets today. Get tired of one wallet, just download a new one and import that seed instead of sending coins and paying the fee.

If you wrote down and store your 12 word seed properly this is not an issue. If your coins disappear after an update it's easy to put in your seed and restore your wallet. If you don't have said seed, your coins could very well be gone for good.

The risk as I see it, it crashes to 1850. Your sell order triggered at say 1910. Now price has risen back to 2200. You log in and realize your no longer own any coins. You will now have to buy back in at 2200. Just something to be aware of.

This is market depth. Green are your current buy orders at varying prices. Red are your sell orders at varying prices. Gives you a decent visual as to what direction the price may head and where resistance is.

Should be able to set it up right from the app iirc. I don't quite know how this would be an alternative to PayPal to receive? It's more of a thing you have to use bitcoin even when bitcoin isn't accepted. I'm not sure how it would work to transfer from fiat back to bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-07-29 07:00:58
Encrypted backup may not work. I too upgraded to 9.3.3 and my copay wallet was gone. It took it upon itself to make its own new wallet. I had to delete this new wallet and restore the old one with the 12 word seed.

It's linked to your bitpay wallet. You send coins to it and they turn to dollars. You then use it as a debit card. It is legit. I don't know of any issues with it, except that it stores value in dollars and not bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:29:03
You mean a node. 
It's a good idea to run your own.
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:04:12
Having BTC as a complication is great! It doesn't update as fast as one would hope (20 min) but it's much better than nothing. Remainder of the app is good. Developer is very quick to address issues and or suggestions.
@_date: 2017-06-25 02:10:56
Bitpay is a fine wallet for daily use coins on a phone. If your looking for longer term storage then Electrum is good. Anything more your best bet would be a hardware wallet.

I'm sure if you have peers listed beyond ten of them then you are working as intended. The Bitseed will drop peers if there is too much being asked of it. As far as watching it via ssh, I have no idea. 
I much like you am just starting out with this. Used to run a node using qt on my machine until it got to hard drive space hungry.

Copay/bitpay is set way high. They came out with an update that allows for custom fees. I have yet to find the location of these custom fees. Pretty sure they forgot to include this in the update, yet said it's included.

Some people get burned with stop losses. A bubble will burst, buy orders will be retraced forcing your stop loss to trigger much lower than your set amount. Your sell order will execute near the bottom and buying will then resume. You will log in and find you will have sold the dip and the price will have recovered in the mean time.

Have that seed backed up and you can use all the wallets.

Maybe this is what they mean? I took it as they added custom fees which is very much needed.
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:14:09
No. My issue turned out to be a bad ethernet cable. Once I changed the cable it began downloading the chain. It did try and speak with the network, but kept going down. I was able to reach Bitseed. They said that if your not caught up with the current block the Bitseed will be pretty unresponsive to the network. Once the full chain was done downloading the unit began relaying. 
Is yours still downloading blocks? 
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:55:04
This will work. They transfer to your bitcoin wallet. You keep and spend bitcoin like normal. You need fiat for what ever reason on a debit card? You transfer bitcoin to this card, inside the app. You now have fiat on the card, spendable where ever visa is accepted.
