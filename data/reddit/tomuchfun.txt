There's actually one other little shitty country that does it. Are tax havens really considered laundering though? The money is again no good in the country you're hiding it from to pay taxes.
@_date: 2015-06-06 03:20:48
In some states, you can't wait till they turn around then pull out your gun and the stand your ground law will cover you.
I while back in Texas some guys radio was stolen out of his truck, he caught the thief right as he was running off, chased him down after about 1/4 of a mile, shanked him, took his radio back, and left the guy to die.
Stand your ground covered his ass even though he didn't call the police.(the last part amazed me)

If you're buying things like gold or diamonds or shit that can be easily hidden, sure, but at that point why not just hang onto the euro, and you're money is as good as useless once you get it back out unless you're planning on spending it like pocket change. If you're buying something like cars or property, you're asking to get audited. 
I'd still be pretty leery of buying tons of metals or things like that, because typically your name is on paper somewhere.
If you're buying food, or TVs, or things like that, I'd hardly call it laundering.
I think the end objective for anyone laundering in Greece would be to make the money as legal as possible to get it in a bank account outside of the governments rule.
@_date: 2015-06-29 16:11:19
Actually it's China, I swear it was some tiny country 
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:54:55
The Greeks aren't touching crypto, and if they were, they'd be limited to $60 a day. This crisis just shows the world this kind of thing can and will happen. So people in other countries are buying.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:21:02
Now I'm just confused, why launder or leave Greece if that is the case.
@_date: 2015-06-29 13:35:36
To launder, you pay taxes..... And you have to set up some shell company, where you had a legit company to start with.... 
The correct response was, assuming they want to leave the country, or EU boarders are very lax because they're all EU countries. 
You don't launder to avoid paying taxes, you launder to pay taxes on illegally gotten money. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 13:25:53
Look at it this way OP, the Greeks use the Euro, and the EU isn't going to crank out euros to bail Greece out. So if you can get ahold of your money, you're perfectly fine. Now if you can't get your money out of the bank, you're fucked and you couldn't buy Bitcoin anyway. 
Now if Greece leaves the EU, no one is going to loan them money, and then they'll almost have to use their own currency so they can just print print print to pay. That's when you buy Bitcoin since now you're being paid in some trash paper money. But again, if you've got a stack of euros stashed away, you're fine.

It will work the same as it does now, miners, but instead of mining for blocks with a set reward, the reward will be transaction fees. It's way way way to early to tell what those will be worth. 
I think sidechains are going too be another big incentive to keep mining once all 21 million are mined.  They should hop on that

You guys are mind fucking this guy!
OP 
Butcoin is an online digital currency. It works like this, thousands of people run there computer to "mine" for bitcoins, the process of mining is simply them using their computer to solve complex problems that allows me to send or receive coins. Miners mine one block at a time, and right now the person who solves the block receives 25 bitcoins plus the transaction fees for all transactions in that block. No more than 21million bitcoins will ever exist.

I hardly bother to read things like this because anyone screaming ASICs are bad(don't even know if that's what you are screaming) is a greedy miner. The truth is that any decent sized computer or hardware company could 51% attack the bitcoin network or any other network with or without ASICs, where the coin is CPU, gpu, or ASIC mined. 
Miners who are anti ASIC are like today's youth(and probably are) they want everything for nothing.
IMO ASICs raise the hashrate and make it harder for a 51% attack(unless the attacker is willing to throw the resources of a computer company it the attack)
Brings big money to the game because they know if they buy 100,000 coins the price is going to move, but if they mine and hold it, no one is the wiser.
And most importantly it beefs up demand for supply and demand.
We are using these coins as money and gpu miners are bitching because they are hardly going to break even after ASICs come out!?! Give me a break bro I pay for coins at market and you want to mine them out of thin air at half that market price? Fuck off =D
Again this isn't towards you OP just why ASICs are good whether you like them or not

If you want to hit gold, come up with a truly random card shuffler that could be used for poker. I feel like all the current sites somehow rig the game. Everyone I know has terrible luck in seals and were good players. It come down to bullshit cards, 4 of a kind and you'll get a guy who pulls a straight flush on the last two cards. But it happens too much, so many hands like that. I feel like one players is them and it's just constant baiting.

It's pretty real currency in the sense that people will accept them for products, and exchange them for paper money, gold, anything really.
The reason the official wallet is taking so long is because the client is downloading every transaction on the bitcoin blockchain that has ever happen! So it could take a while, I recommend this wallet though as it's the official wallet, and very easy to backup. 
A good alternative is "multibit" it just stores the last couple of blocks on your computer, and the rest are stored online.
And a good wallet for your phone is bitwallet, it's the one I've been using, and I like it a lot.

Mining by design is supposed to be unprofitable, that discourages this from happening. And when I say unprofitable I mean even if the hardware was free or next to nothing, mining is designed to be unprofitable, because if I can get it for free or next to nothing so can someone else.
Step back for a second and just think of this. If I've got a bunch of money and can pay employees out of pocket to build my hardware for dirt cheap and use it to mine and turn a big profit, then so can a number of other people with a bunch of money. People will continue to make these companies and do the same thing until it becomes unprofitable. At this point they have to decide, am I in this for the coin, or the fiat. The people who are in it for the fiat will drop out, and be replaced by people in it for the coin. At this point these people are mining at a slight loss instead of buying coins, but they want the coins, not the fiat, so there is no pressure on the market from the miners. 
I'm kind of just going on and on here going no where, but in short, the only reason these companies are/would be profitable right now is because there are so few of them. Soon(maybe not that soon) they will not be profitable and they'll be mining coins at a loss for the sole reason of not buying coins from the markets.

Dude I have it for you, and this is IMO the best ting google can do! 
Create an online wallet and online server for the blockchain.
To access this wallet you need to 
1st log into your Gmail
2nd select the bitcoin, or litecoin(if you want to say Litecoin ;) here come the downvotes) and type in your password for that.
3rd and finally to send coins type in your wallet password
Also they should make it so you can copy the wallet.dat file and easily move it to the official client wallet.
They could probably charge 10% of the fees that are already charged, so a total fee of .0011 instead of .001
With the blockchain size google servers can help.

Yep, that'd be the one. It can take some time to load the blockchain, I think it's around 20GB right now. 
If you don't have that much space you can use multibit whick stores most of the blockchain on online servers. But the official bitcoin client is going to be the best wallet to use in terms of backing up your coins.

Let the officer come out, how long do you think they talked? What if he was yelling shit is they forcefully took her away, and the cops said yeah he said that. What if the cops let her pester him for 30 minutes, we have no idea what happen. 
He has said it now. Do you really think he would tell one reporter and think it wouldn't be followed by more, only to deny it because satoshi never touched a computer again. His untimely stroke plays into what im typing o.0  but come on real satoshi would have known and would have let her get a full interview and everything if he wanted to come out. He didn't want 2 days of trolling reddit as an old man, or do you think he did?

Dont fuck with any coin besides litecoin or bitcoin. Litecoin has a different mining algorithm and its creator wanted it to succeed with bitcoin, not over power it. All other coins just copy bitcoin or litecoin but make a minor change, then there are the ones like quark or ripple that are just so stupid and an obvious scam, but still noons fall for it. And I know someone is going to say why have litecoin when we have bitcoin, we only need one, well good sir, open up your wallet how many credit cards do you have? I have a visa, american express, and a MasterCard, so why have more than one credit card company???? Try and circlejerk me.

Dude come on, the fire was almost completely out when building 7 went down, the fire chief is heard yelling "get everyone out, we're gonna pull the building" and fucking in top of that BBC reported wtc building 7 collapsing 30 minutes before it did with a live shot of the building still standing. Not to mention the building right next to building 7 had massive damage to it from falling debris, but it never caught fire, in fact building 7 was the ONLY building to "catch fire from falling debris"

Easy kid I can tell dogecoin brought you here, and that is good, that is what it is for. Here is why dogecoin will not last, all coins mined in 2015, once that happens miners will have to mine for transaction fees, and doge fees are .001 and a block happens every minute. So if we plug in 100,000 transactions a minute, that is 100 doge a block, now just for fun lets pretend the block is 1,000 coins because every social media site is all over DOGE and its the hottest thing out there. Now lets say all this hype made doge a penny and it is twice as valuable as litecoin(LOL) that means every block puts out $10, or $14400 a day, that will not support miners. It leaves about 1440 miners making $10 a day, say 3,000 miners for FUN making $5 a day. It makes it really easy for someone to do a 51% attack, and while they couldn't really double spend, they could stop any and every transaction from going through making it useless. Now I know I know you are thinking change the fees that will fix everything. But you have to realize EVERYONE votes on this by upgrading to the new wallet, or not upgrading. And who would upgrade to pay more fees, especially as a miner, and a lot of dogecoiners are dogecoiners because it is supper profitable right now. That's what happens when you make a joke coin and produce a huge amount of it with little though. Dogecoin was meant to be a joke, I'm not bashing the guy who made it in saying he put little thought into it.

To be fair none of the articles really force anyone to use only bitcoin, but most of them paint the picture that there is no reason to use anything besides bitcoin. While I do agree that this whole system would work with only one coin, and that that of coarse would help bitcoins stability because you wouldn't have hundreds of millions in other coins. I also agree with the fact that this whole system works quite well with more than one coin, and more than one could emerge as quite useful. 
Back to my "this whole system would work with one coin" comment above, while it would, I think people would be a little more skeptical about bitcoin if it was the only coin out there.

I don't think the way to get people to use crypto currencies is to force them to use this one, and only this one. People like choices, that's why most people carry around more than one type of credit card. Most alts are pump N dumps, but litecoin isn't IMO.
One of the reason I hold LTC and BTC is because of articles like this that try to point everyone towards bitcoin and say it's the only thing that's going to take off, and the fact that I can get 6 confirmations in usually under 5 minutes on litecoins network, vs usually an hour on the bitcoin network, if I just want one confirmation, which is all I wait for when I buy from people locally, it's basically instant with litecoin.
You force people to use one thing and they will stray away from it, and you will achieve the opposite of what you set out to, If you allow choices, people will decide on their own which one(s) are the best.
Edit: Oh yeah, I forget, let the Downvotes come because I hold both BTC and LTC!!!

Don't get me wrong, I like doge, but I'm not sure that it will ever go over $0.05 a coin, I treat my crypto like a very long term savings/retirement account, so I can't justify buying any. But I do think it is a great tool to get people onboard, especially because if you send them 300 doge they can send hundreds of transactions and play around with it for a lot longer than the equal usd value in BTC or LTC.

When microSD cards first came out in 2005 the largest size you could get was 128mb.
In 2009 the largest microSD card on the market was 2GB.
In 2014 you can now buy a 256GB microSD card.
But let's say the blockchain becomes so heavily used that it far outpaces what the consumer uses. In that case there are wallets like multibit that store most of the blockchain in an offline server and only keep the last few blocks on your computer. These wallets sync the network in a matter of seconds no matter when the last time you opened it was. Multibit is free to use, and I imagine even if everyone in the world used multibit it would remain free because of the amount of income they can generate from ads on their website.

Go to coinbase and find your deposit address(not familiar with coinbase so i cant tell you what to click to get there)
Then copy that deposit address
Go to btc-e and click on funds, then click in the withdraw button next to bitcoin
Then scroll down to the bottom and paste the deposit address from coinbase in the withdraw address spot on btc-e

Lucky you, I tried doing a 9 character one and setting it so it could be anywhere in the address, not just in the prefix, but when you do that you can't set it to be nonecasesensitive, so it almost hurts the odds, well I'm not entirely sure if it hurts the odds because it won't even show them when it's set up like that. Type "-r" before whatever you want and ditch the 1, but it's always case sensitive, and it will search for a lowercase L too. Hope it can be fixed.

Oh but I can't, I hold a very small amount of BTC, right now I'm all in LTC, but I have not much to show for my investment. I got fucked over trying to buy in at $50 with a large sum of money, then I had to save and wait and I missed out. With all my buys I'm   +\-5% daily, just depends. 
I'd just never tell my friends I really have nothing to show for it because of why, I have nothing to show for it. I don't want to be like yeah I could have been rich as fuck at this price, but I got fucked over and lost it all. They'd never have trust i it then.

I just posted this in another thread but I'll post it again here for you.
I text a good friend of mine that follows bitcoin and told him someone released an article claiming an old man names Satoshi Nakamoto is the real Satoshi, and they released all his person info. 
His response to this text was 
"I have no idea who that is" 
And like I said he follows bitcoin and likes the idea, just doesn't own any.
But she expects us to believe on of the cops basically says "No way thats Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin" 
I started doubting the piece right here.
Giving up personal info disgusted me, especially with all of this being extreamly circumstantial, and more than likely adding one word in the quotes to totally change the quotes meaning.

Coinbase isn't a true exchange where you can place buy and sell orders, instead you link your bank account and buy Bitcoin at the current price(you can't put in an order for this price) they then pull an ACH transfer from your bank and give you the coins. If you want to get money on an exchange to set orders id recommend you 1. Buy Bitcoin on coinbase, 2. Send Bitcoin to BTC-e, 3. Sell Bitcoin for usd, 4. Place your order.
Now the only part that will suck for you is you'll have to wait for the ACH to clear to get your BTC out of coinbase(but your price is locked in) until you can verify your account.
Once you verify your account they'll let you have the coins instantly before the ACH clears. To verify you need to link a credit card, have purchased $100 in Bitcoin, wait 30 days from your first purchase, and answer a few questions. 
There is also circle and trucoin, but they all pretty much operate the same way. Right now this is the easiest way to get BTC at a market price in the USA. You could wire money directly to an exchange, but I think it's easier to sign up at coinbase buy BTC and send it to an exchange, then sell for usd. Then if you want to cash out you buy BTC, send back to coinbase and sell.

I think, I THINK that the private keys are the random generated part and the public keys are reverse engineered to match the private key. So if you have any private key you can figure out the public key, but not the other way around. And as for the offline is this wallet pre created, the answer is no, there are so many possible addresses that you would have better luck winning the powerball every week for a year straight than generating the same address, even creating them offline where your computer can't check to see if the address has already been created. 
I could be wrong about the first part, but to my knowledge I am not.

Yes yes, but you can't expect something that goes up not to come down. The reality of it is that this is a money market, and people are here to make money.

Different internet browsers all give you a different experience of the same thing, essentially that's what all alt coins do.
I'll give it to the guy who said the internet because that's a damn good one to throw out there, but I'm sorry, you still have options when it comes to the internet even though everything allows you to browse the same shit.
But this in fucking money, cold not so hard digital cash, we've got moneygram, westernunion, paypal, visa, discover, MasterCard, American Express, dollars, yen, euros, rubles, checks, ect, ect.
It's money, it's a little different.
I'm not trying to preach to any of you to buy litecoins, but IMO if you're going to buy an altcoin, and you're not looking for a pump and dump coin, LTC is really the only one IMO. Maybe doge or nmc, but LTC is king of the alts, and it and dogecoin are really the only alts smart enough to realize ASICs are a good thing.

Bitcoin payments over nfc(that's what it's called right?) would be an extremely easy integration into any app as log as the device is comparable. 
Now I don't know much about the technology, but my only fear would be people fishing for private keys by sitting in a cafe all day. Idk if that's possible, with nfc(or whatever it's called) but I know credit cards that have the technology are easy targets. Never connecting to another device and scanning a code is extremely safe, as long as the new method is safe there is no reason it wouldn't be embraced in the(our) community.

So I logged into paypal today to find out an eBay buyer opened a dispute after 92 days. They are claiming I never sent the item, but I did and I entered the tracking info into eBay. BUT of coarse eBay deletes all the item info after 60 days, so now I have no proof of shipment. To make it worse paypal loses the tracking number when eBay dumps the data because it was linked through eBay. Sooooooo I'm pretty much fucked. I'll be closing my eBay and PP accounts ASAP and moving to selling for bitcoin only, as chargebacks can not happen.
Edit: OH shit, I just found out this guy runs his own LLC. I found multiple mailing addresses for him, but they're all off by just a few numbers, same building for sure though.
I think this fucker is scamming hard on eBay and hiding the profits in his architecture company. BBB needs an email from me. 
Another update: After contacting the buyer he's agreed to send the phone back. He's claiming its blacklisted, but it's not showing as blacklisted when I search it on my TMobile account. I find that strange and wonder why he just didn't go through ebay months ago, but either way looks like he's getting the money back and I'm getting my phone back.

You just have to be smart, I booted up my laptop two nights ago(my crypto wallet only laptop) because I hadn't in about 9 months now, and for some reason my laptop wouldn't load anything.

I'm guessing even if it wasn't flexcoin your coins are gone. Almost every site that promises interest is a scam site, or they short your coins in hopes of getting you that interest, and that doesn't always work out. 
Do you know the address you sent the coins from? If you do we can figure out the address you sent them to, and we can probably figure out what service owns that wallet as long as someone has tagged it.
Gotta love the blockchain!

@_date: 2014-11-01 20:45:20
Nothing has replaced it, it's just slipping in value.
But if a coin replaced it no one would risk buying into that coin and the people who took that coin to the moon would drop it in a heartbeat. 
Even if satoshi came back, proved it was him and released BSCoin it wouldn't replace bitcoin.
But if satoshi were to come back he wouldn't make a new coin, he'd have new code for bitcoin and he'd attempt to hard fork the network, resulting in bitcoin still being bitcoin, just changing how aspects work like confirmation time or something like that. 
They're isn't a big need for altcoins besides pump N dumps, you can make bitcoin do anything you want it to do if half the miners agree, we could add dark send, make blocks take place every minute and reduce the reward to 1/10 as to not screw up the limit, you can change anything and everything.
Back to my pump N dump altcoins before I post this, two coins that I won't put down are namecoin(don't hold any) and litecoin(hodl a lot) namecoin has another use, and while it could be implemented to bitcoin, who's going to pay $400 for a domain. As for litecoin, not much has changed besides the fact that it's fast as fuck compared to bitcoin, but I justify my holding it by simply asking myself how many credit cards I keep in my wallet. It could be a bust, but most people like options in this world, and I don't see any reason why litecoin is not the best option out there after bitcoin(maybe the best if you share my view since the ratio is 1:90 right now)

@_date: 2014-01-12 03:00:55
Because they do 10s of thousands in cash transactions every day, and the owner has to walk out the front door with $10,000+ every day all in cash, this way he could accept bitcoin and walk out with a flashdrive in his pocket and no one would ever know. But honestly business owners would probably see the currency as to unstable to deal with.

Localbitcoins or maybe craigslist, you could also try coinmama.com (I used them back in the day) the mark up on coin mama is not the greatest though, looks to be 15% right now, not exactly ideal. 
Coinbase isn't bad IMO, pretty sure you can buy like $100 a week by linking your bank account and giving them very little personal information. But I mean once you link your bank they know who you are. If you can find someone on craigslist or localbitcoins that will do it for 5%-7.5% that wouldn't be a bad deal at all. The guy I met on craigslist charged me around 7% and I was happy to pay that at the time.

I believe it was tipping Tuesday, and now it's tip all November. 
I believe the general idea is to give out tips in hopes the new users will enjoy getting tipped and giving tips, while also experiencing bitcoin, even though they are experiencing it off the blockchain.
Reddit probably accounts for most of the tips, but I've seen a few on YouTube, I don't have any social media I'm signed up for besides facebook(only for tinder) so I'm not sure how the tipping is going over there.

I've made little profit with litecoin even though I was in early, I'm not one to sell because holding helps the coins out, I mean someone has to hold the coins, am I right?
But anything I have made has been spent on bitcoin, a couple of months ago, and now between the two I think I'm at a 10% loss over the 13 months I've been in this ride.
But I never would have bought bitcoin if it wasn't for litecoin, although I still hold 10x as much LTC as BTC in USD figures.

You're tipping right, thanks :)
But no it's not on a side chain.
Basically how it works is you load you account by sending coins to the deposit address, then those coins are moved into a wallet with all the other coins other users have deposited. It still shows your balance as your original deposit amount, but when you tip they just balance books by saying ok you just sent 10 bits, so we'll subtract 10bits on paper from your account, and add 10 bits on paper to this account, but no coins move from that big wallet until someone wants to make a withdraw.

This is how eacrow works, he sends the money to the escrow, you send product, he releases funds.

I've done some selling on and escrow through just about any site works perfect. The buyer sends it to the eacrow, the escrow makes me aware of it and I send the item, and the buyer has a day or two after receiving to look the item over, after that I get the money and it's a done deal. Maybe all of that takes 10 days. But sadly with eBay and PP you have to worry about things like this months down the road.

People who use ponzi to describe bitcoin clearly don't understand a ponzi. A ponzi is run by a few individuals who take money and "invest" it, but in reality pay returns with new customers money.

No, I haven't know people that do though. I would pay a real-estate agent to handle most of the work. And where I live two weeks notice for a breach of contract is all you need to kick them out, so slap no late payments in the contract and you are set. Unless the tenant declares bankruptcy, then thats out the window, but there is always the cash for keys option, and you know if they are declaring bankruptcy they are taking that cash. But you are right you cant expect to get 12 payments a year for every house. The actual figure is $672,000 I took out $72,000 for horrible renters.

I am not the most knowledgable about sidechains, but I do know the basics on them so I'll explain the best I can.
So first let's imagine that I want to make a sidechain that my website uses, we'll say the sidechain just keeps track of users balances so I don't have to do the work on my computers. 
So I'll need to code my sidechain somehow, then pay X amount of BTC to get it to become a sidechain of bitcoin.
So now that it's a working and running sidechain, it is essentially a block inside of the bitcoin block. All of my users transactions go inside of my block that is in the bitcoin block, and the miners mining bitcoin must solve my sidechain block inside of there bitcoin block to successfully solve the block.
A sidechain could really be almost anything as far as I know, anything that requires computing power could be turned into sha256 and put in bitcoin blocks. 
Edit: If I lost you anywhere or didn't explain something good enough, just let me know and I'll do my best to answer it.

I should have jumped out, I made trades on the way down, but I didn't get any huge gains. I bought in LTC weeks before the rise and made 20x my money so quick, I was blinded by greed. I had known about bitcoin for a while and watched the run up to $266 the year before, but had none at that time. I knew about the $3 to $30 to $3 rise crash of bitcoin, but I didn't think that would happen with litecoin. I figured bitcoin would crash, I figured litecoin would crash too, but not this hard, sooooo hard. Looking back it's so obvious though, $100 to $1000 that quick! And $2 to $48 that quick! It's just insane! But when you've just got on the rocket you feel like it'll never crash even knowing it's crashed before.
I'll be ready next time, we've got a few more greed cycles in us, I mean how can we not.
10 months ago I was telling myself I'll never be able to get xxxxxxxx amount of LTC, now I'm getting close, soooo the overall lose of 10%ish is a blessing in disguise.

Listen dude, you buy into this expecting gains, but you can't come in here like an idiot and just buy, you have to use your brain.
People expect this magical run to the moon, and it just doesn't work like that, the price isn't going to go up 1000% and hold that price with nothing put people backing it. Price never should have hit $1200, the people who bought in at $1000 to hold were delusional. And the people who sold at $1000 did what you and me and everyone else in here would have done. 
The reason it's been steadily going down for so long is the fact that there was no real reason to break $1,000. But it's not just going to instantly drop from $1,000 to $250, it just doesn't work like that, it's a slow bleed out. 
It's funny really, just use your brain and stop thinking it's going to $100,000 any minute now.

Glad you are spreading the word, if it makes you feel better I got ripped off in 2012 trying to buy a few hundred bitcoins for $1,000 I got scammed and thought hey fuck this bitcoin thing, and didn't buy any until $300 my life would be sooooo different at this point.

They found the servers. Once they found the servers they said oh hey, this idiot registered for the server with his real name, what a dumbass. They then shut down the servers and now they host the site, but they just put up a picture saying it's been seized.
Also they probably knew it was him before they found the servers, they knew he was a part of the original silkroad.
Edit: the other two DNM sites that went down were hosted from the same servers, there was no arrest for either of those, as soon as those owners find new servers they'll be back up. 
It's quite fun to go read about this in the DNM subreddit.

To the guys saying it never existed, 
Why is it so hard for you to believe that an exchange operator programmed a bot to run the price up, buying BTC with money he didn't have, because he really didn't have all of his customers money or BTC? 
Then once the volume from bots/users that aren't his/them picks up, he dumps all the BTC on them in an attempt to make up money that he should have for customers that he doesn't really have?
And before anyone else says there's other exchanges and they all went up too, welllllll if exchangeA is buying at $500 and exchangeB is selling at $400 what does any logical person do? They buy anything under $500 on exchangeB and send it to exchangeA to sell.
Don't say it didn't exist because it did, I'm not saying the price wouldn't have had a dramatic rise without that bots, but they played some roll in an attempt to save ship.
Edit: OP, the answer to your question is, no one wants to pump that much money into bitcoin, but it's pretty easy to pump it when you control the books and can take money that you say you have that you don't really have and buy BTC that you say you have that you also don't have.

Well we went from a high of $1200 to a low of $430, thats a pretty big crash, or $800 the day before gox stopped withdraws, to a low of $430 and now back up to $560. Thats also a pretty big crash, there is honestly no reason to sell, bitcoin isn't broken, a few players exited, and most of the traders tried to cash in on a sell high buy low game. But think of this, gox didn't lose 750,000 BTC in a day, a week, or even a month, so on that last big run to $1200 we had and 5% in fake BTC being traded on gox. So the when this has all passed in a month or so, $800+ should be the norm again. Good time to buy, anything under $1200 is a deal, history repeats itself :p

You forget that at litecoins current value the hash power is almost maxed out, people aren't going to mine something unless they can see profit in it. At litecoins current price it's hard to expect it to have a network the size of bitcoins.
And the fact that LTC ASICs are two years behind bitcoins, which plays a huge role in total network hash.

Trust me, I'm well aware of this myself, although you actually usually do want one, 0 confirmation are no good with dealing in large sums of money, and anyone with a brain will tell you to wait for one confirmation when you're spending or receiving a decent amount of coins.
Edit: I guess there are a few idiots that would buy $1000 worth of coins and not wait for one confirmation.
Guess none of you saw the thread yesterday about the guy who got double spent for $50 because of a 0 confirmation transaction. 
Sure it's very hard to perform that 0 confirmation double spend, but with $100 I could find a list of say 10 sites that have 0 confirmation credits and bounce that $100 between those 10 sites until I'm finally successful, and I have no doubt that that's what the $50 double spender that screwed that guy did.

I can do my best to ELI5, I'm not to most knowledgable person on sidechains by any means though.
But let's say I have a website set up that does some sort of bookkeeping, or something like that. Instead of buying computers to keep track of everything, I pay the bitcoin network to run my sidechain and do everything for me. 
It's a good way to expand the use of bitcoin and turn it into something besides a payment processor and a currency. 
But nothing is stopping litecoin from also implementing sidechains.

Another possibility is that she opened a phishing page on both browsers?
Either way though, you did everything the right way(besides giving the money back) somewhere this buyer intentionally or unintentionally did something to get screwed/screw you. 
I'd seriously recommend not sending to a localbitcoins address when selling whether it's from localbitcoins to localbitcoins, or from any other wallet to localbitcoins. 
In these early days they're are lots of scams out there, and it's just tough on us all, I'm sure many people here have been scammed(just probably not for as much as you and I) in some way. 
I think the safest way to sell is one wallet to another wallet and I mean like a personal wallet, not some services wallet.

For the future set up instant buy on coinbase so you don't have to pay someone a 5%-10% premium because that's about what they'll charge on CL or LBC. 
To set up instant buy you need to; buy $100 worth of BTC, hook up a credit card(it won't charge it unless your bank account has no funds), and verify your identity through a series of really fucking creepy questions.
The questions are like "what color is your car" my thoughts "how the fuck do you know!?!?!?"

Sucks to be them, but that's just not how it works. In that world "bitcoin V2.0" would be a completely different coin. And there is already a coin or two that use the bitcoin name like bitcoin scrypt. 
What most people forget or just don't think about is this whole system would work with 1 bitcoin. All we'd need to do is add more decimal places and BOOM.
This is the point of a deflationary currency though, everytime someone loses a bitcoin, the value of my bitcoin goes up. Now since we don't know what coins are lost and what coins are not it doesn't have an immediate effect when someone loses a few coins, but it's not like the price would skyrocket anyway.
Another thing people think of is "well what about when people die"  
The answer is there are ways for those coins to be saved(don't think anyone has set this up yet) but let's say I'm 80 years old, and I know I'm past my prime. I could put my coins in a wallet with a password and if I don't enter that password once every however many days I select, then X anount of coins go to this address, and X amount go to this address. 
If this whole thing works out and becomes something bigger than everyone imagined(that's impossible BTW people here already dream too hard) it's not like everyone is going to have a significant amount to lose anyway. Most people at this point will have a coin or two.

Transaction fees, In a world where bitcoin is still used in 50 years, it will certainly have more transactions per block than it does now, this will result in more transaction fees that the miners are able to claim.
Also I'm pretty sure sidechains will cost bitcoin to have them as a sidechain on the bitcoin blockchain(can someone who knows more about sidechains confirm or dispute this?) but if this is true they will also be able to claim those fees in a block.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:56:01

Think about this OP, gox didnt lose all those coins over night, it took them at least a year of slow withdraws.

If 51% of people on bitcoins network agree to the changes it remains as Bitcoin. 
When 50% or less agree to the changes then it could split the blockchain into two blockchain resulting in two different coins.
A few examples of things 51% of people would not agree to would be, unlimited number of coins, or a new type of proof of work.
However if a new verizon was released that moved blocks to be produced every 1 minute and changed the rewards to adjust accordingly im sure 51% of people would agree.
Whatever wallet you're running is basically a vote for the version of Bitcoin that wallet is running on, so it's highly recommended that you actually read what the update does and decide for yourself if you like it or not.
But for someone to essentially highjack the code would pretty much require mass stupidity among the users, and an unwillingness of those users to revert back once they realize they're mistake.
There are a few coins that exist because people tried to make changes to Bitcoin and failed(anyone out there know what ones?)

I really don't think anonymous is the way to go because it makes coins seem more criminal than most people think they already are. But if you have two or more serious coins it becomes really easy to mix the money and make people lose track if it. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 22:39:47
It is traceable because of the blockchain, but anonymous unless you share your wallet address. And you can not send $100,000 from the USA to china in less than 10 minutes for less than $0.05. Even with western union you have to wait 15 minutes before you can actually pick up the funds.

Changetip a don't have fees, it all takes place off the blockchain. All of the coins deposited to changetip go to one big wallet, or maybe a could big wallets. Them they just keep a ledger of who sent who coins so they know who has this many and who has that many. The only coins actually sent on the network are; your initial deposit, the move from your initial deposit address to the big wallet, then your withdraws. 
Think of it like a big bank vault and how the bank just keeps the books, except all the money is actually in changetip unlike the banks.

Its at over $70 right now OP.
But here is the deal, 50% were premined, and only 98,000 coins are circulating right now. With the other 10,000,000 being held by the creator from the premine. So the real market cap is only $5,000,000ish. Once he "gives the coins to all Icelanders"(yeah right maybe 1000 people will accept them) they will get dumped on the market FAST. Also the creator has received over 1,000 bitcoins for his "work" and is probably using them to pump the price. He probably figures if he can get the price to $100 and everyone gets 38 coins, hell yeah they would accept it, but why hold it? Also no news is being broadcast to the Icelanders, so how will they find out about this? The creator was "smart" but the dump will be epic. When the air drop happens these are going under $1, until then, with only 98,000 coins on the market, it could hit $1,000

It does, it's not really a commodity in any way.
I really just think LTC has more room to grow as a complement to bitcoin. 4:1 is a pipedream, but 10:1 could very well be reality. 
As I say people like choices, and some people just don't like the fact that there only seems to be one choice in crypto right now. 
And besides that the volume for LTC is pretty damn high, people love to trade the ratio, LTC will be around for a while.

Coin is a 3rd party app(not official) 
The only real downside to these apps are if they store your private keys they then can control your coins.
Mining doesn't effect the price persay, but when people dump the coins they mine it does. We have to mine because if we didn't there is no company to mine for us. And if there was a company mining everything for us then they would have complete rule over all transactions.
Your address is listed as well as the address you are sending to. There are ways to remain anonymous if you wish too, but if you are not trying to his your identity you could be found out decently easily assuming whoever is digging has cooperation of exchanges or services. Did you enter your name anywhere in coin? If not they won't know who you are, unless you sent coins from coinbase or an exchange linked to you, but even then coin probably won't track you. 
Someone else can go in depth on why open source is good, but it's open sourced with a voting system, so if a bad player wants to release something that will screw the network no one will install that update meaning that is a vote against that update. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 22:15:47
They waited 92 days to open this case, it's now day 94 I didn't get an email but I check every day or two to make sure it's running smoothly. Today it wasn't, It's going to be my fault because I don't have a hard copy of the tracking number 92 days after the sale because ebay and PP are dumping data. 
But 92 days, that's honestly ridiculous, and that's why I enter it in ebay. But I get how the system works now and I don't like it.

You seem older though, $2,000,000 and you could probably get a job working 10 hours a week at UPS just to get the health benefits for your entire family and live a nice life.

It's simple, paypal doesn't support the exchange of digital goods, so anything digital bitcoin included is not a valid item you can sell with paypal. Want to give it a test run for $5 worth of bitcoin? I pay, you send it to me, we have emails with proof of both addresses, and you can try all you want to dispute the chargeback.
Edit: hell I'd put my address in the paypal notes ;)

Bitcoin doesnt need them, we need them if we want money.
Drugs will be there though, they are a nice market to get things started but its highly traceable cash. They will probably scale down to less obvious sites.

I 100% agree, for the traders to make money others have to lose, and they are more likely to sell instead of buy to make a swing, because selling is easy and risks nothing but profits, but buying puts real money on the table. 
Edit: Down Voting me doesn't change this fact, I'm not a shill from im a holder, but don't fool yourself, the pros are raking in profits in dollars while keeping their same share of bitcoins. 
There's a bottom here somewhere and it's right around the $300 mark, because around the $300 mark is when everyone says "oh fuck, the price is so low I know I can make 10-20% in two days, and we all make that 10-20% then the cycle repeats itself, something happen last week that sent us up to $450 and I said wow, we're going to crash again, but this right here might be a sign of change, but time will tell.
50k coins hitting the block isn't going to make anyone bullish, but it really doesn't matter since we all know this is just a good entrance point for some millionaires and the coins will be held(because who would pay over spot to dump on the market??)
Don't go into denial and down vote here, instead understand why Bitcoin is going downhill for the time being, all of us make money when the price goes up, the whales make money when they play games and push the price down.
It's a shame the mods here actually hid this post, it should be seriously discussed here.

You don't get it, it is all fake money. Printed paper money and minted coin currency account for about 25% the money in circulation. The rest is just made up digital money. People default on loans, the bank isn't going to take money from you it used to lend. They they mark it as a "loss" but nothing changes. You still have the same account balance and the bank is still free to loan mass amounts of money.

I've never used localbitcoins, I believe if the coins are still in their system they have free reign to settle disputes and whatnot, and they are easy targets for hackers. When people sell me coins off localbitcoins I have them send it to my BTC-e account, it usually takes 10 minutes before it even shows up on the blockchain, but at that point theyre 100% in my control and if they're gone, well oh well my fault. 
I have a Theory though, I think she did something like replacing the qr code you scanned to another qr code for a wallet that someone else was sitting behind at another location. 
If she just "logged" in and you did a quick scan then she could have easily shown you an edited picture, then logged into the real account.  But you should have contacted local BTC on the spot, I would have said "look, I sent the coins to the we code you told me to, and that's all I can do, you see they left my wallet blah blah, I'll stay here while you call local bitcoins because I know I didn't do anything wrong"
@_date: 2014-11-02 01:03:30
I wouldn't count LTC as a shitcoin, it will have a place if/when BTC is mainstream just because people like options. Everything else is complete trash, I've lost many LTC buying alts that took massive shits. I actually went around two days ago to get what was left off the exchanges, got a total of .2 LTC from two exchanges, and the other exchange went belly up. Spent somewhere around 10ltc when the price was at $10.

It's a tough call, I saw that post too.
The things that make me think it's legit are:
Cloud mining is profitable if your the one selling the contracts.
It's a German site and Germany declares bitcoin as money.
And that's about it
Things that make me think it's a scam are:
A lot of cloud miners fuck over users anyway.
They're looking for investors for who knows what, but the green light is already set for Q1.
You can add the London bank account to the legit or not legit side, it fits in both.

Sidechains don't really kill altcoins at all, don't listen to the people that claim they do.

Typical lottery winner^^^^^^ I mean 10 mill is more than my parents have made in their entire life combined, but only about double what they have made so far(made not saved) and I lived a pretty average life as a kid. Do you really think what you can buy with 10 million today can be bought with 10 million 10 years from now?

Weeks later when they hit $266 I cried and cried, and I didn't have the money or trust in anyone associated with Bitcoin to buy in until $350ish last October.
I hate that bitch that scammed me with a passion, I was foolish sending money, but this bitch had hundreds of shrill reviews and even sent me $100(10%) of the coins I was paying for before I sent any cash, so it seemed to me that I was in good hands.

Well those coins all have their own blockchain that is totally separate. With sidechains the chain is attached to the bitcoin network. So instead of miners just processing transactions they are processing your book keeping. 
But the miners reap no rewards from my sidechain, besides the money that I pay to run a side chain.

How to tumble 101 by tomuchfun
Step 1 make several BTC-e accounts.
Step 2 deposit the entire sum into one account
Step 3 make a BTC-e code for the entire amount (this is what starts the mixing, your wallet will be swept and your coins will be sent to a random large address they control)
Step 4 redeem that code on one of your other accounts(never reuse an account)
(Now if you search the new BTC address on blockchain you'll notice it's empty, but your BTC-e balance shows your actual balance. It's because BTC-e isn't going to waste fees moving coins Everytime you make a BTC-e code or make a trade, it's just going to stay in some cold wallet until the funds are needed)
Step 5 make BTC-e codes for random amounts.
Step 6 redeem the codes on different accounts.
Step 7 withdraw the coins to different address, not the same one.
You'll also notice that the coins you get wont come from the cold wallet your coins were swept to(usually, once in a while you'll get coins from the same wallet and you'll need to repeat, but if you've got 50 accounts, maybe 1-3 withdraws will come from that wallet that the coins were swept to.
People who use mixers are idiots, there are plenty of ways to mix coins using legit sites that don't put your coins are risk.
Edit: I'll just add the quick edit that BTC-e daily withdraw limit(and yes that includes BTC-e codes is 100 BTC per account, so In the hackers case they'd need to start out splitting the coins to around 200 different accounts then start at step 3.
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:49:11
If you're in the USA coinbase or circle are the easiest places to buy bitcoin at market price. You link your bank account and then can buy it at market price plus a small fee. 
Another easy way to buy it is craigslist in person for cash, but you'll likely pay a 10% up charge at minimum if buying off craigslist.
What ever way you choose to buy bitcoin, you're going to want to download the official bitcoin wallet on a computer that is 100% virus, spyware, malware free(this is key to keeping your bitcoins safe.
It'd also be a smart move to go buy a $5 sd card or USB drive(I use a 512mb sd card, as well as a few USB drives) and make a backup of your wallet.dat file and save it to your sd card or flash drive. 
This way if your computer crashes, or some unforeseeable event happens you'll always have a copy and you can re install the bitcoin wallet on any computer and put the wallet.dat file in the correct place, and the coins will show up.
I'd recommend making sure your computer is virus ect free right now, and downloading the official bitcoin wallet. The first time you put it on a computer it can take hours to load every transaction that has ever taken place. 
Multibit is another good wallet that stores most of the blockchain online off of your computer, so it takes up less space, and it takes 5 minutes if that to download, install, and load the blockchain. 
But this wallet is a little harder to back up in my experience, so for new users I recommend the official bitcoin wallet.

This is actually a pretty good analogy for the time being. You don't see everyone trading in that tesla for a BMW now that gas is "cheap" again.
Honestly guys if we go sub $100 I'm not selling, I mean I'll shit a brick and laugh at all of us, but I won't sell. It's something I believe in and something I think the world needs, and If I've got to lose a few grand(lotta money for a college kid) for something I believe in I'll gladly do it. Wouldn't be the first time, but it'd probably be the 2nd to last time.

Why sell, it's still something I believe in, and I didn't plan on touching my investment for 5+ years anyway, I'm basically right back where I'm started, and I'm totally fine with that, most people expect to have money tied up in an investment for quite some time.

Tell your buddy to set his buy order at $1 over the current price and just let everyone sell into his wall. Don't make the price rise, once he takes those coins off the exchange and the supply of btc goes down, the price will go up.

My bank gave me a call for making repeated "suspicious withdraws" my largest withdraw was $1,200. Its funny because I actually go to the bank and get cash. So basically they freaked out and called me because I'm no longer keeping money in their account, it made me all warm and fuzzy inside.
@_date: 2015-08-06 04:14:48
It's often because your account is new, or someone tried to do a few chargebacks and bad mouthed you to a rep. I came in here to say "call them and as long as your account isn't a couple of days old they'll fix it" but it seems that they've fixed it. Honestly, you can't complain too much about this, funds get frozen in everything except crypto(well unless you count those "frozen" transactions during the spam attack) 
What really grinds my gears with PayPal, is that I've had two chargebacks, both of which were very very close to their 180 day limit, and I got fucked over on both of them. You seem to run a more legit business than me(a kid selling my personal shit on eBay, not a business) so I'm sure you keep all your shipping receipts and everything.

Honestly, if I had bitcoins right now, id be watching the market 24/7 waiting to dump when I felt the time was right. Bitcoins going to see a solid rise in the price, but I think $300 is all it can sustain long run, however it could totally go higher than that by quite a bit. 
I'm honesty hopping the Bitcoin pump is strong and the LTC/BTC ratio stays where it's at so I can get another chance to sell, missed my order by about $0.30 on the LTC sell and I'm kicking myself right now.

IMO coredevs could be the downfall of a coin, it just leads to centralization.
I thought about this pretty hard at work tonight before even seeing this this thread or your comment. You don't need the devs to do the coding, anyone can as long as they can fork the code, and that's how it should be since we're all about decentralization. 
There's really too much in my brain for me to tell you, but the short run is that the core devs should be doing everything they're doing as well as reviewing code someone wants to use to fork and telling us, yes this does what they say it does and is safe, if you want it here it is and let the vote began.

Exactly what it says, the devs want to rely on 3rd party off chain solutions to fix the limits of the blockchain instead of trying to improve the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:40:12
Honestly he has a very valid point you know.
The devs are acting in the VC interest.
I always see Bitcoin allows you to be your own bank, and shit like that. Well if you're using some off chain method, no you are not your own bank.
This is what VC want so they can profit off a system that was designed to exclude them.
The devs are heading down a slippery slope.
I hold crypto, I'm not trying to trash it, the coin I hold doesn't have the current ability to do it much better than Bitcoin, however it can handle more transactions and has a better anti spam feature. (Note still haven't said a name I'm not in hear to pump)
If the devs OR someone outside of the devs will not try to make Bitcoin adopt and push users towards using off chain transactions for payment, the coin will die.
You know why the blockchain is so important, everything is there, with proof and no one person can change it, takes 51%.
Services can do what they want, and if in the future the current laws for the banking system were applied to off chain Bitcoin transactions, well I think you know how bad that is.

I'm going to post a link to my other comment in this thread for you to go read, because I pretty much summed it up in that post.
Sure, some off chain transactions will always occur, but is that really want decentralized money wants to push? For profit services much like the current system?
Also, loading a "soda card" as you put it, or honestly any account to do off chain transactions in no better than converting to cash. Cash in a computer system(once it is in the system and they system controls the cash) could be transferred just as easily as Bitcoin in a computer system.
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:32:04

The difference between a car, the Internet, and a cellphone, is people "need" those. I need a car unless I want to spend 5 hours a day walking, or $50 a day using uber. I need the Internet to do schoolwork(some people need it to live LOL) I need a phone because of work. But I don't "need" Bitcoin or litecoin. When I need something it doesn't matter how it works, all that matters is that it works. When I don't "need" something it matters. 
The reason no one needs Bitcoin is because the end result isn't any better, it's actually worse, the spam attack proved how limited the network is and how heavily it will have to really on 3rd party "banks" to process everything.
Again I'm here with you guys, I've got money on the line. Buttttt some shit needs to change IMO.
I hate hating, the main reason I post is to try and get others out from under the devs beliefs. I think bitcoins failure is going to be because the devs thought this was the way to do things and the sheep listened. 
If Bitcoin, the network, the currency, the blockchain, all that shit, can go on and do everything without "banks" piggybacking the system and taking from the little guy, well now I "need" Bitcoin.

I could find you more examples, if you'd really like me too, but I became interested in optioning such a gun recently, so this was a ban I didn't even have to go look for.

Going to take some heat for this comment. I think it's a little reckless to encourage a risky highly speculative currencies use with some of the poorest people in the world. If Bitcoin succeeds, great! They now have more money but are probably still pretty poor. If it fails(yeah yeah yeah I know that won't happen(but "don't risk more than you came lose")) the poorest people in the world just got shafted, the people who couldn't afford the loss.
Anyway, enjoy downvoting me even though you all know this is a risky investment.
@_date: 2015-07-01 04:47:17
Let me say it like this, Bitcoin is not a Visa card or anything like that. It's cash. If cash gets stolen from your car, do you get it back? Can you send cash anywhere in the world instantly? VISA charges fees and interest to insure you. If visa adopted Bitcoin, they would ensure your Bitcoin by charging fees on every use, and interest in late payments. Your visa is not money, trust me, I've taken a few economic classes, and in all the classifications of money, credit cards are not one of them.
Bitcoin functions like money for everyone except the governments. Governments NEED to be able to print money.
Bitcoin is money by the people for the people, not money by the government for the people.

Never said it was a good plan, just like relying on 3rd party processors is a terrible plan. However that's how the devs want to deal with the current abilities of the blockchain, just moving things off the blockchain where you really can't prove you own any coins if you're a user.

@_date: 2013-12-28 00:48:02
That makes no sence?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:13:30
Oh trust me I'm way up right now, not even suicidal, I thought we were all calling to raise awareness for bitcoin?? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:29:39
Don't buy!!!! We are going to $500!
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:52:08
I think litecoin is the only viable second crypto currency, everything else has been pre mined or pumped and dumped.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:46:41
Its nowhere near $200 right now. Why are you making up numbers? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:19:03
You just cant stand the fact that another currency exists. You will learn one day, one day.

I buy mine off a guy off craigslist :) haha
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:44:23
Haha maybe a pot sucker, they are pretty cheap.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:06:08
I post up on craigslist, tons of people replied back and I picked the one with the lowest fee percentage
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:38:33
You R bitcoiners are sad sad men. You can't understand that competition is healthy, and if crypto succeeds there will be two or three in the world. You just don't understand. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:38:57
Looks like you typed that up and pit it on your desk and took a pic. Dunno

"Why did you decide to accept bitcoin as pay?"
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:52:30
Very well put.

Id take 27.5 litecoins
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:27:29
Who is the idiot now?
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:09:54
They could, but then they would have to admit it has potential and it would be a real currency in this country, but conttolled by the frds, who wants that. And hmmm buy them, or take them, its an obvious choice here. And if they did Buy them up, everyone should sell them to them and then fuck them by not using them and switch to litecoin.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:42:32
Making me happy and money at the same time!
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:32:44

Well the suitcases had cash in them, now I just travel with my wallet with an SD card inside it and a bag with an extra suit in it.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:03:21
I have, but I saw this same post twice yesterday....
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:40:34
How much? I saw the one you made, and it was good, but you would have to make a border around the QR code so the hole for the keychain doesnt fuck it up.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:56:00
Ideas on what software? I installed a new bitcoin wallet, hope that doesnt screw me.

@_date: 2013-11-22 04:17:50
He's a patsy. The feds run silkroad. Someone found out(a goooood hacker) they offed him, offed a few more, set him up so they could legally obtain all the bitcoins. How could they possibly figure out his wallet password, and how could they figure out his PIN instantly to withdraw funds from SR.
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:45:34
Listen, figure out how many coins you would have if you would have spent all the money on coins, then see how long it takes you before you want to jump off a cliff, my buddies $7,000 miner from last year has only made him $9000 as of this very second. But if he would have bought coins he'd have over 100k right now.
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:12:53
Read the comments one guy calls bitcoin "the honey badger of currency" I guess that billboard worked!

@_date: 2013-11-16 14:52:45
the buyer probably though "I'll do a charge back" they are going to have a rude surprise when they contact eBay.
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:00:23
900 was the bubble then it popped, its just like 266 in april then it popped. You are safe to buy right now, you will lose or gain 5-10% on any given day, but when the next bubble starts you will know it, then it will crash but you will be much much higher than you were before.
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:17:57
Don't help him!!! He's working for the feds!!

They dont like beggars here, its actually kind of hard to get a tip. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:44:19
If it does hit $200 tomorrow I'll buy the hell out of it tomorrow. I'd take the $800 in savings buy 4, then take out a "personal" loan for a few grand and buy more.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:48:41
Haha man I was telling this guy at work about them again trying to get him on board and $800 came out of my mouth and he said "I thought you said they were $300)" then I said yeah that was two weeks ago, and he flipped shit, this happen about an hour ago LOL, so that is why I picked those numbers.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:38:45
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:50:24
Thats why you buy in, when these countries collapse the 1% can buy bitcoins/litecoin/altcoins. Global reserve?
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:03:21
Have you really never heard this? Thats actually low, i thought we printed 3 billion a DAY, it's sad man, really sad.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:50:21
Litecoin just lost over 10% as well :/

The hackers would target the banks.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:34:44
I cant think of a way to convince them, I've tried to convince my dad, but he thinks there are an infinite number of them and everybody is just buying like a sucker, he doesn't get it, maybe he will get it when I take him to dinner and pay in bitcoin, but maybe not. Maybe he will get it when I buy a car in bitcoin, but maybe not. Maybe he will get it whn I buy a house with bitcoin, but maybe not.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:48:44
Post an add in craigslist, thats how I got my litecoins and the guy sells bitcoin as well. Then you dont have to hassle with verifying everthing.

@_date: 2013-11-19 16:52:57
If you dont own it its not a good thing for you. It is good because it means we are getting farther away from government comtrolled money, and big banks that screw the people.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:21:29

@_date: 2013-11-19 06:09:34
Honestly I stopped reading when he said xicoin, if he said convert all to litecoin and hold out for a week, I would have kept reading. But $10 into xicoin? Yeah like its going to blow up over niggt if bitcoin bites the dust LOL

Welcome to the internet?
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:57:58
I'd tip you for being into bitcoin at the ripe age of 14, but I'm to poor.

He seems to old to know wtf cryptocurrencies even are
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:46:15
Id buy something on silkroad that everyone wants but the user has no review and post a review to let everyone know if he is legit or not.

I'll bet your dad was happy.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:49:33
Hmmmm spread the coins around because who wants to use a currency where a few people own the vast majority of it. Hell them winklvi however you spell their names, could destroy the market and bring us to $200 if they sell everything off.
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:09:53
I can't wait for another 9/11, hopefully the truth will come out next time, then the government will crumble, and then crypto will go through the roof.

@_date: 2013-12-20 20:36:06
Do it
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:23:07
Because they then have to wait for the exchange to send a wire transfere?
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:46:26
Ahhh, it was another guy then lol, posted a thread on a QR code keychain he made for his dad. If you would make me a prototype and ship it I'd be willing to pay in bitcoin  :) as long as its not to pricy

Bitcoin will make you lose big money, big big big money accept quark coin.

You could call it luck, or you could call it the smart thing to do. When you can buy drugs on the internet with something it is quite obvious whatever it is is revolutionary, not litecoins that was luck.
@_date: 2013-12-29 19:38:27
I don't have a source, but I know we print 85 billion a month and take that and times it by 12, and boom, just over one trillion. I have been withdrawing every paycheck I've ever earned from the ATM the day after it hits my account since I was 16, I do not trust the banks, and I know that if we all decided to get our money out only the first few in line would het their cash. I just cant wait for the dollar to collapse since I'm about $5,000 in debt and only have $300 cash but have thousands in coins. Hell if the dollar tanks I'll the $5,000 to pay off my debt will probably cost a litecoin. I'll try to find the 85 billion source really quick
Edit: that was easy to find, its from forbes ;)
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:29:01

Every time one of those cards pops up you do the math in your head -1 0 +1 and that is your count. If you have a really negative count there is a higher chance of a facecard coming out of the deck next, if the count is really positive there is a higher chance of a low card coming out of the deck next.

Someone tried to rob me at gunpoint in my car, i had my $10,000 car with liability and like 5 grand in apple electronics in the car because I buy and sell, I said fuck it and pushed the gun to the side, fucker didn't even have it loaded. Had a pocket knife in my door, and got him in the arm before He got out of the car, I've been there. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:12:51

It probably will, but I would imagine the miners who have millions will sell as it rises and it wont go up that much
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:42:37
Do it. Lets say something bad does happen tomorrow, lets go as far as saying the U.S. declares bitcoin illegal. Well look how that turned out for drugs. But even if there is a small crash because of the recent rise long term she will be ok, its not like shes planning to cash out in a month right, she is in it for the long haul right? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:40:29
At a trillion dollar market cap we are looking at $50,000 a coin.

I think were cool right here and its not going to "pop" I mean china is going all in, canada is almost all in, germany accepts bitcoin as a currency and you can pay taxes with bitcoin in germany, the U.S. ins't making them illegal. And thousands of people hoped on in the last week, I see bitcoin taking off right now.

If you can time the market sure, but you will be paying fees for money transfer from bank to exchange, and taxes on profit soooo a $50 swing isn't going to get you a lot unless you are using $25,000 or something close to that.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:38:50
Use a calculator since you cant do simple math. Its easy when there are 0s just 5x8=40, then ad two 0s so 4,000, then add 3 0s so 4,000,000.

@_date: 2013-12-05 06:49:33
If you think this is just an investment, this is not for you. You have to believe in what crypto currencies will do for the world money supply and a free market society. If you do not believe that will happen then you don't believe in bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-12-07 17:43:05
Can they really even afford any bitcoin at all? Do they even have computers there? And if they do have computers do they have internet? And if they do have internet how long is it going to take them to download the blockchain? Months years?

@_date: 2013-12-20 05:51:23
Piir bastard just lost $10,000, it will probably only take till january 2014 to make it back around $1,000. The sad part is when the price hits $1,000 he will say we have to wait till the end of 2014. Then december 31st 2014 he will say, bitcoin over $2,500, the bet was it would be around $1,000, not $2,500. Then you guys will fight. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:14:20
Why would anyone go to western union to send money if they use bitcoin if you could just send bitcoin? They would rape you on fees to use there service, now a good idea would be something like IFK bitcash! A store that sells bitcoins and buys butcoins at a 2.5% fee so users can send cash via their service to other users or just buy/sell bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:56:37
A 3% stake in a currency they previously had no stake in, yeah thats nothing.

The guy I buy bitcoins from bought a 500 GH/s mining rig for $7,000 months ago when the price of bitcoin was at $150, he just got it 3 weeks ago, and is only $1000 short of making his money back..... but if he would have put $7000 in bitcoin at $150, well do the math

No shit is has a small market cap. Thats why it should hit $25,000 a coin. But the fact that its "expensive" scares people.

I actually only hold .15 bitcoin, I am a believer of all or nothing and I see them going to all, so $10,000-$100,000 in a few years. I bought litecoin at a 100/1 btc/ltc ratio and I'm betting that the ratio will close so I can have more bitcoin than I would have If I just bought bitcoin with cash. Saying all that, its hard to say if its going to tank then stabilize or just keep going up, or level off at some point without a drop. But when you "invest" just remember you are betting to go big or lose it all. Bitcoin will be worth thousands or nothing in the "end"

What is to say it will crash, the Chinese like to save, they lose money because if inflation by putting money in the bank even with interest. Im guessing at $1000 it will crash to $900 because $1000 seems to be a target sell for a lot of people, then it will steadily continue to rise.

Its not 100% safe right now, but it never has been 100% safe anything can happen, but you saw it peek at 900, then crash to 700 in seconds to then hit a low of 495, id say thats a big pop. The next bubble who knows maybe it pops right now to 0, maybe it pops at 2500 and rests at 1500, who knows, but honestly if are planning to hold for the long run, now is a good time to buy. I doubt anyone will come in this thread and tell you its a bag time.

You can hate old man, but I do not trust the dollar or our government one bit. You know if we all tried to go empty our bank accounts not even 25% of us would get all of our money right? The banks are here to FUCK YOU, they make money out of thin air, and your generation continues to give them more and more and more money, and that allows them to create/loan more money out of thin air. How can you not see this? Lets say you are I don't know 30 years old, a nice house in a nice neighborhood cost how much when you were 15 living with mommy and daddy? Like 100k? And now that same house is worth 500k. My grandparents house was bought 40 years ago for 25k, there house is worth 300k today. The best thing you can do with your money right now is invest/spend it as soon as you get it. Get off this subreddit.

It is a general belief by all if the early guys(and anyone that invests that has a brain) that bitcoins will be worth thousands, even tens of thousands, or nothing. So its not "too late" to invest if you believe in it. I believe in it because I see bitcoin as being a global reserve for everyone. When a countries economy is about to take a shit everyone buys bitcoins.

Can you link me in on the case? Google didn't turn anything up for me.
@_date: 2013-11-16 14:20:09
You have to let the wallet download every transaction that has ever taken place. It takes hours at first, but once you are synced it will only take a few minutes if you open it every couple of days.

Dont invest, believe!
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:20:36
I was just thinking of selling my 217.8 about an hour ago to buy bitcoin because the ratio had been going down. But in the last 5 minutes litecoin is pulling like a freight train. You thought litecoin was the way to go when you bought, stick to your gut.
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:06:19

They make money from ads, and it was really for back in the day to get people aware of it
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:13:13
You can keep USD in an exchange(I wouldn't for more than a day or two though, but it costs money to get the cash into the exchange. The one time I was going to put money in an exchange it was $40 to have it there in 3 days, what a rip off, and it was going to be a local thing, I said fuck the exchanges I'll find someone local. Some of the exchanges have hoops to jump through that could cost you $100 or more to get your money in them.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:41:02
That sounds like a butthurt comment

@_date: 2013-11-21 17:49:43
If they buy it up, we all switch to litecoin and steal their money, if they buy that up, we switch again and screw them again, they wouldn't try it a 3rd time, but if they did, we screw them again!

It comes from a "block" just imagine a giant field with thousands of locked treasure chests and your computer is working to unlock them. Once it is unlocked you get the reward and you move on to the next chest, and so on and so on until all 21 million have been mined.

Why would you use escrow if you are meeting in person?
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:35:48
The funny think is your parents are brainwashed. Tell your parents people have been buying drugs with the USD for 50 years plus. Tell them people have been buying drugs with bitcoins for 3 years. If you can just get 1 bitcoin, by the time youre 17, you might have more money than they have ever had.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:51:32
It wouldn't because no one purchased any in an exchange, it's that simple.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:38:01
Anyone know when the last litecoin will be mined?
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:28:09
You know the top 1% have over 50% of the nations wealth right? You know they hoard money right? So this isn't a problem unless they just dump it all at once, and if they do, cheap coins and everyone wins. Well besides the panic sellers, they lose.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:20:31
Mbtc is badass because its around 1:1 with the USD, and it will make it easier for noobs to understand price of something in BTC.

I would say yes it is still worth it to mine, BUT I would look for a steal of a deal on a used mining rig that gets about 250-500 GH/s. Plus if you buy a new one its going to take a few months to get it. Id try craigslist in every city within 250 miles of you. Just my .02 bitcoin

Think of economies collapsing, people buying bitcoin, then the country releases a new currency, who whats that paper? Not the people who just got fucked over using it. Then think that the US just keeps printing and printing and printing and printing and printing and printing and printing. Hell $200,000 in 10 years could very well be $50,000 in todays money.

You're a fucking idiot, no it wasn't. The fire chief is on video saying "we had to pull the building" he fucked up, you cant just pull a building and make it fall, you have to set up demolition charges, you guys were all fooled. Also WTC building 7 was reported collapsed 30 minutes before it had collapsed and a live shot showed the building still standing when they reported it had fallen. It's ok that you are all in denial. I'm an American, and I know the truth.

It will always be profitable, you just need a good miner. And also people will stop mining so there will be less people to compete with.

@_date: 2013-12-07 05:40:32
So 99.9% of all quarks in existance right now are controlled by 1,000 people at the max. And there is no fucking coin cap on these, so deflation will occur. Even after 247 years 50% would still be owned by a few select people. I hope we all tune into the keiser report and he bashes them.
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:39:47
All the guys buying pounds on SR to push locally could have made 10 times as much money just by doing what you did. I wonder how many small time drug dealers that were selling ounces for 5000BTC two years ago are crazy rich now.

A much higher sales tax would solve all of our problems. Especially for the poor as they do not buy much. Here in Texas we don't tax food, so that would also help the poor. Libertarianism cough cough.

Why did you have $50,000 in a sheep market account, just sounds like you were asking for something to happen.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:19:44
No because if I told someone one bitcoin is worth 6/10ths of an ounce of gold, they have no clue what I'm talking about.(yeah all my friends are retards who keep all their money in the bank because it is the safest there ROFL) but if I say one bitcoin is worth $750 you know what that is. In the future though, you never know, I mean once the Dollar collapses what with they compare it to, the EURO?(shit that will crash before the dollar) ummm Chinese money?(wait the rate of inflation in china is so bad your money loses value even with interest if you keep it in the bank) Pesos? Yeah maybe pesos, no one in Mexico wants pesos any way, and I doubt they are printing/minting the hell out of them, Pesos it will be.

If you want to use my script:
Install Ruby - 
Save the script to brute.rb in the same directory as bitcoind
Edit the script to change the passphrase from "oops" to your best guess
Start up bitcoind
run: ruby brute.rb
The script was originally for Linux but it should work on OSX or Windows with some small changes.

I don't have a source, but I know we print 85 billion a month and take that and times it by 12, and boom, just over one trillion. I have been withdrawing every paycheck I've ever earned from the ATM the day after it hits my account since I was 16, I do not trust the banks, and I know that if we all decided to get our money out only the first few in line would het their cash. I just cant wait for the dollar to collapse since I'm about $5,000 in debt and only have $300 cash but have thousands in coins. Hell if the dollar tanks I'll the $5,000 to pay off my debt will probably cost a litecoin. I'll try to find the 85 billion source really quick

Bitcoin and litecoin have more intrinsic value than gold and silver because you can actually buy things with them! When is the last time you went into a restaurant, ordered a meal, and when It was time to pay took an ounce of silver out of your pocket. Now for some smartass who "has done this" how easy was it to cut one of your bars of silver in half to make change?

I was pretty skeptical about buying litecoin over bitcoin, but I bought in at 110:1 ratio, so it doing good so far. I always saw litecoin as silver to well you already know. I just heard  of it sooner, and see more people accepting it than any other alt.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:50:40
$100 million dollars, that will soon be $1 billion that could very well become even more than that, trust me they like money, they don't bust people just to get them off the street at a fed level. They do it at the fed level to 1. Eliminate competition or 2. Make money. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:58:02
I think you are wrong, its like running an international business, but only allowing customers to pay with USD. There is room for 2 or even 3 crypto currencies, and I think bitcoin is 1st, then litecoin, then a currency that a block gets mined every few seconds that way skeptical retailers can wait 10 seconds to see it confirm.

You lost me... The total number of wallets would be 62^31(62 times itself 31 times) how do I get this number you ask? Easy 31 character addresses. 26 letters in the alphabet times 2 because of uppercase and lowercase, So 52, then ad 10 for the numbers 0-9 and bam 62. Now with 31 character addresses it becomes 62^31. Someone do the math, my iphone is overloaded.
