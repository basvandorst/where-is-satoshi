Hi there! Please also note that the following communities also exist to stifle free speech by downvoting. Unlike who has never called for a linked to post to be downvoted, the following communities do very often explicitly call for their linked submission to be downvoted. Please report to site admins for breaking the rules
Please also note the myriad of other subreddits that do not allow opinions other than a far left one to be seen by downvoting those that do not align with their views. All subreddits such as should be reported as well for "stifling free speech" and be reported to the admins as well.
Outside of reporting these subreddits to the site admins, please also petition your congressman to have reddit banned since it allows every user to downvote which obviously equates to stifling free speech and is a clear violation of your first amendment rights.
