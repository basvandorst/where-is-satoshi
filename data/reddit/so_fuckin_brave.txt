It doesn't change the need for miners, it makes it impossible for the average person to host a full node, reducing centralization.

I switched from blockfolio to Delta, it's better in most ways
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:44:23
People are saying xrb can. But it's unproven
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:44:18
Can't, I'm all in already

Most of them are involved already, and they all know that it's a risky market, and they can lose it all. Some of them just don't want to put in the effort to invest actively. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:00:58
Almost made it. Here comes 14k
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:06:55
Sounds pretty unconstitutional to me. But I know they don't really care about that anymore
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:46:26
Binance does
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:29:10
Lol, it does seem that way in the comments often
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:35:00
It used to be disliked by some in the community like 5 years ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:05:21
Or today
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:55:42
Uh oh. Sorry man

instructions from the former president for 19k
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:38:39
Nope, not you
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:23:14
Even the log scale graph is started to bend upward
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:24:55
Looks like I'm too late
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:16:13
Probably the emoji at the end
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:20:07
Can you buy with credit cards?
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:44:08
What happened?
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:30:00
And .001 will line 650?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:12:06
Yeah, lost some btc because I couldn't get back in at the low
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:03:45
It's not, it's a short term problem with solutions actively being worked on. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:57:46
What's that site?
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:39:45
All raw, dude
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:22:04
Because there are steps
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:51:33
I took one and made it ten. Worth $1000. Lost it shortly after. It hurt then, hurts more now, though I sold at 800 on the way down from the 2013 bubble too. Slowly working my way back in for the last year
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:36:10
I certainly hope so. But honestly, that just sounds impossible. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:17:15
Couldn't agree more
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:00:59
It's never going to be over, attacks will always be happening. Bitcoin will survive and succeed regardless
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:49:26
Just send your Bitcoin to this address. I'll send it back with the ath attached.  19XUgGz4jdLbvsgMxoaVTabD2m8wGTPywd
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:41:29
Can you help me understand how that works?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:16:30
Can I see some info on that? (So I can share it)
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:25:19
Coinomi on Android allows custom fees
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:07:16
you should pm it to me so I can test its security for you
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:17:49
No it wasn't. Mt gox was way more confusing than coinbase. Anything that you have to send in money, wait, and then make a purchase later is too difficult for many
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:38:11
I'm all about vertcoin, but I don't think this is the place for that
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:05:40
There will be fees associated with creating lightning networks, and many transactions will always take place on blockchain, it's just a way to reduce the congestion without deteriorating the decentralized network it's built on. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:15:01
That's a bullseye shot for sure
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:55:54
Only truth in here
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:31:56
Is that information public?
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:19:40
Well said
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:50:00
Are you doing the price analysis? What is it based on?
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:11:18
I meant the sub usage
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:00:03
Seems that way
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:56:54
Honestly, I think coinbase is fully fungible, but I can't prove that. I keep my Bitcoin on a hardware wallet, but I think coinbase is done for those who don't care about what Bitcoin stands for, which, honestly, is 90% + imo
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:29:24
What's the address? Too lazy to scan
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:33:16
I think (hope) we'll see some resistance before 5k. Might move it up a little bit. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:15:38
At least 4
@_date: 2019-04-21 08:46:51
I haven't been paying as much attention lately, what happened that you're raising legal fees for?
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:56:24
Do you have a good suggestion of a wallet for Android with true custom fee options?
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:02:35
If you have this basically power to end price drops, I think you have a moral obligation to sell
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:00:30
Is it too late to withdraw now?
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:50:31
What would you recommend?
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:20:16
So fuckin brave

I would also enjoy this challenge if you decide to open it up again, how much is missing? 
@_date: 2013-09-11 03:39:10
Mandatory drinking? Sounds like my kinda party :) 
@_date: 2013-05-16 19:08:08
That sounds like a horrible strategy. Way too much risk
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:54:09
I'll use it to treat my friends to a night out on the town!
@_date: 2013-10-23 16:24:47
Does it only work on reddit?
@_date: 2013-08-30 16:14:26
Because I don't have any at the moment.
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:24:05
I'd probably do that
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:32:51
I think moon day should be when the market cap reaches the cost of the first moon landing. (about 150 billion in today's dollars)
@_date: 2013-05-16 16:52:08
How is it a no win? Seems like simple statistics and careful bet placing could easily make a little money. With some risk obviously. 
@_date: 2013-09-15 17:58:03
Omg, thank you! I've been trying to get that for so long.
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:50:03
I lost some Bitcoin to bitfloor as well. I tried to contact support to get my coins back after. Nothing.
It seems like the people who has their assets in USD at the time of collapse got their money back. But the btc was"stolen" so it couldn't be returned. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 17:26:18
How long ago did you transfer?
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:10:16
I think he meant the price per BTC is about $100 higher
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:19:50
Why are there no QR codes for deposits?
@_date: 2013-06-08 00:09:52
That's an insanely large fee. What bank do you use?
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:10:34
The numbers are exactly the same
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:28:01
Thanks man, that'll pay for lunch tomorrow! :)

Thanks man
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:28:02
I don't know the exact math, not do I have time to do it. But grim everything I've read on here, there's no way that's right. You'll probably never get a return and you're probably better off just buying some coins and holding.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:08:53
have they gone through at all?
@_date: 2013-10-13 19:07:08
To be fair, I know a lot of people who are passionate about sweet baby rays. It's pretty awesome. 
@_date: 2013-06-08 00:07:44

@_date: 2013-12-03 22:46:35
I gave a friend of mine $5 worth of bitcoin in june (50 mBTC) and he just used it to buy that Iphone camera lense kit!
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:38:33
Search your computer, email, any storage you may have anywhere for a wallet.dat file. if you can find that, you have found the bitcoins. (essentially) 
@_date: 2013-05-31 21:59:02
They went through after 2 hours, just now.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:36:51
Just the opposite, but the "difficulty" changes every 2016 blocks to maintain the 10 minute average. So, no matter if the blocks were slower or faster, the system would adjust to compensate.
@_date: 2013-10-15 02:26:48
The touch screen interface is really hard to use. The sliders for choosing odds are impossible to use accurately. I lost money by clicking roll dice and it moved the slider all the way to the right (to the other one) and I lost. If that makes sense. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:34:44
Decided not to wait :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:09:05
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:49:07
Thanks, man. I appreciate that
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:52:46


@_date: 2013-12-02 07:32:10
I would buy a few more bitcoins
@_date: 2013-10-24 00:01:18
Try answering the question "how long have you lived at this address" with a couple different answers. They get it wrong sometimes
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:51:07
I see. Thanks for that clarification
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:24:05
the number of blocks is not decreasing, it stays at an average of one every ten minutes

I tried to deposit more than .001 btc (.004) but I didn't read the deposit page until street I sent it. It says send exactly .001. Are the other .003 gone now?
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:13:01
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:47:09
This seems way to good to be true
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:28:14
I'll send something your way tonight for sure. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 21:03:01
Sometimes it takes hours for a couple of my bets to go through. I have 2 up in the air right now myself. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:41:46
Is that something you choose when you sign up? seems strange
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:56:42
So, how are they lying?
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:10:16
The darkest of arts, And probably some former Russian scammers too.
@_date: 2013-09-04 22:29:08
Just bought back in. Instant effect!
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:12:05
What is their end goal? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:29:58
The US government has the largest single wallet
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:59:36
that sounds perfect to me.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:24:53
I'll buy it for 1 btc
@_date: 2013-06-08 01:44:43
I use a local credit union. Doesn't cost me anything
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:11:32
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:50:19
I would assume that's because they aren't fully legal to be a real exchange. but I don't know. And I haven't looked into it at all
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:21:14
Also, I can queue an order for any size, regardless of the funds available, I know it won't go through. but I might not realize that I don't have $9,999,999,999,999,999 
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:10:27
then they would charge his credit card
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:54:00
This is just the Beginning.
Don't bother mining, It is not profitable at the moment 
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:02:36
They wouldn't give you your coins
@_date: 2013-09-11 20:45:13
What's the problem here? You haven't received your transaction?
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:45:21
When did you decide to start spray painting for a living? What's your story? What did you do before you did this?
@_date: 2013-05-16 18:45:22
That's true if I send in the same bet continuously. But I feel like it can be gamed a little. Maybe that what every gambler thinks though.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:18:14
decimals don't seem to work properly
@_date: 2013-09-11 23:39:17
Is the second wallet fully synced with the network? What type of wallet is it?
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:26:41
I just deposited and nothing is showing up at all. 6 confirmations so far 
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:19:34
all of the games are available on other websites

@_date: 2013-05-29 19:02:50
I wish I could support the cause, but I just lost all my coins. You might try throwing a couple coins on satoshi dice if things don't pan out. I do believe there are a couple loan sites too, but I don't know of any. Good luck
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:26:21
Coinbase.com is the easiest solution
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:53:46
haha, that makes sense. thank you

@_date: 2013-04-03 21:14:49
I was wondering why there was such a sharp drop. Wonder how this will play in btc value
@_date: 2013-06-01 05:29:34
I wish I could afford one of these. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:43:07
Just the opposite
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:27:37
Just the market responding to good news
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:14:55
Same as everywhere else then?
@_date: 2013-09-03 01:34:07
I keep getting this when I try to register for the coinbase account at the end 
"You don't have that much - please visit the Buy/Sell page to add more funds to your account.."

Awesome, thanks man
