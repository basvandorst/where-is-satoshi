No?  
I mean, you can have a look - it is demonstrably false.

0.62 btc, and that actually stings...

That isn't what "Counterfeit" tho....

Please don't use "BREAKING" in the title :) It's hours old when most people see it.

sounds like something a SOCIALIST would say!

Yes, and hats off for LG and their Prada phone for showing us that how nice that experience could be.

Yes, what was this outlandish display that could actually register my touch - on a SMOOTH surface? Those Apple engineers had done it again. And that, kids, is when touchscreens were invented.
(Ok, they were one of the first to use capacitive instead of resistive, but you DID basically make it sound like they invented the damn things) ;)

I especially like the part where you get to hand wave Moores law

Repeating the statement, it would seem

1.0 bitcoins is completely arbitrary

The cost would be the same.... If they were bought cheap now they would still be as expensive to give away at some point in the future as buying them.

Are you trying to sound like you see conspiracy theories everywhere? Because that is what you'd sound like if you did.
Sorry, not meant as an insult, I was just... uh... I almost used the word "triggered" un-ironically. I think I'll just stop here and offer an apology. :(

There is no government mandated minimum wage - that much is true. Strong unions take care of perceived egregious unfairness.

The way they removed the floppy in the G3 without replacing it with anything that could properly fill its role way painful for plenty of their users.  
This was before most people were online and CDs were expensive and not re-writable and USB flash drives were still a couple of years off.  
I can quickly agree that floppies were old tech, and relatively unreliable*. But when the sneaker net is literally your only practical channel of data transfer it sucked to have it removed because of aesthetics. 
And they didn't speed up the death of the floppy with their market share at the time - that took a few more years until the PC industry had an acceptable replacement in the form of internet connections and flash drives.
So it's pretty easy to look back 18 years later and comment on how crappy tech floppies were, but at the time there was no universal alternative and it was an idiotic and arrogant move at the time.

I get ~$1000 per month from the state to attend school, with no tuition.
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:12:09
I like it.
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:00:04
I get that, but to me it just seems like a nicer, but still unfounded, way of saying "secret socialist"
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:01:55
I'll bet you're right, but is it really necessary to start a reply with "You're dumb"?
@_date: 2013-04-06 12:36:04
I have to admit that I chuckle a bit when Americans throw around the word socialist like that :)
