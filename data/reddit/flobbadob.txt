This is probably a very out of place question. But generally,  is it Ok to use a site like coin base as my wallet,  or is it better to have an offline wallet or something? (don't really know how it works).

just a quick question, i just did a quick transfer of like 0.001 from my coinbase wallet to my armory wallet, and there was no transaction fee and it went through in about an hour.
Does this mean that you can do a transaction without a fee? armory is 'reccomending' in a way a 0.0001 BTC fee, but is this required? What would be the minimum reccomended fee paid?

At the moment it isnt even possible for me to do it though (i should atleast have an option to!).
Armory is really enforcing a 0.0001 minimum fee for me, even changing that 'default' value doesnt make a difference to it. Im stuck for ideas lol

i used the website, i might just try using a transfer from armory of a stupidly small amount without fee and see how long they take. I guess i would avoid the app though for sure.
EDIT: hmm it wont allow me to transfer from armory without the minimum fee of 0.0001, why would coinbase allow me to move bitcoins without a fee at all then? :/
EDIT2: it appears that coinbase actually charges a 0.0002 fee, i just hadnt noticed it, so yeah, theres that lol

Slightly dumb question but would that mean the offline wallet is
 technically online at times?  Does offline just mean stored on my hard drive instead of some server somewhere?

Just to confirm,  does it cost me anything to transfer bit coins from coin base,  also can I set my pooling site to cash out into this offline wallet or do I have to go through something like coin base first?
