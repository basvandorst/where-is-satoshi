Once again I urge you not to rush anything.  Way too much at stake and the last thing anyone wants is corrections after the fact.  Of course people are anxious but the fact is a day or two doesn't matter now: the horse has left the barn.  Just stop making timing promises.  The idea of only making announcements at say 12 am or 12 pm GMT (so people aren't refreshing 24 hrs a day) was a good one.

Echoing the others above - these phishing emails are very worrisome indeed (I got one), specifically where the senders got the email addresses.  I strongly urge you not to bring the site or anything else back online until you understand how those addresses were leaked.

Thanks for all your work over the last day Zane.  One thing, as a large and longstanding Bitfinex customer, I urge you not to rush your next steps - announcements, opening up the site, allocating the losses, etc.  These are important decisions to get exactly right and if all of us who are eager for updates have to wait an extra day or two, it's worth it.  The difference between not being able to access our funds for 1 day vs 3 days (or a week) is just not really that big.

I agree with this.  As someone whose holdings were largely in USD, I believe their plan is reasonably fair, and - assuming (big assumption!) the courts allow it to proceed - likely better for most of their customers than the alternatives, especially bankruptcy &amp; liquidation.

archive.is first archived that page in 2014.  Is there **any evidence whatsoever** that it existed in 2009, apart from having "2009" in the title?  This looks overwhelmingly like a retroactive effort to lay a false trail, and I'm disappointed that Wired bought it.  (Or perhaps I should say, sold it.)

But which problem?  It's no good saying "BU makes forks too likely"  "No it doesn't"  "Well then it lets a majority force its will on a minority, which is even worse."  As long as we have different parties who want different block sizes, then we're either going to have forks, or parties who aren't getting the size they want.  You can't blame BU for both.
I'm not a supporter of BU *as a project* because I'd much rather see devs agree on a single protocol, as many other dev communities have thrashed out much tougher technical decisions without splitting up.  But *as a technical design*, the BU approach of letting miners vote on future size, while maintaining consensus by deferring to the current majority, seems as sane to me as any.  IMO it's more consistent with 51%-resolved Nakamoto consensus than this alternative of a group of developers rejecting the preferences of other stakeholders because they know what's best.
And I agree with that at this stage, poor adoption is a greater threat to Bitcoin's future *including its decentralization* than the moderate block size increase BU would likely produce.  Plan 9 had a more distributed design than Linux, but it's sure as hell less distributed now.

I think this is just wrong.  As I understand it, even a BU node voting for small blocks will accept large blocks, *if* enough other miners accept it.  This is how BU ensures consensus and avoids (intra-BU!) hard forks:  "If enough other miners think that this block is OK, then I will let it be part of my chain analysis."  
There are still legitimate concerns about BU, like:
* Many nodes could vote for large blocks, and large blocks could lead to centralization
* Possibility of a contentious hard fork between BU and non-BU nodes
But I believe the BU guys are at least right that it's convergent - in the sense that *if* everyone ran BU, *then* no hard forks would ensue.  At least, if anyone thinks they see a case where BU nodes would themselves splinter into two chains, let's hear it.  I saw no such example in David's post.
(I'm not picking sides here, please let's skip the partisan namecalling.  This is just a technical question about how BU works.)

There are a few different issues here but let me stick to what I consider the crux of it.  Correct me, but I would summarize your main concern (and as: "If we let the miners pick the block size, they'll pick a size large enough to centralize mining in a few hands."
The case I see for BU comes down to two objections to this:
1. Centralization is one risk; there are others it needs to be balanced against, like weak adoption, the  risk I see for Bitcoin right now.  It won't matter how decentralized it is if no one's using it.  So we come to questions like, what block size would miners *realistically* pick?  (2GB/3000tps is pure FUD fergawdsake.)  How *much* would that increase centralization?  How does this weigh against the current tx logjam inhibiting adoption?  But this is all a big topic widely discussed elsewhere, so I'll drop it for now.
2. My more specific objection is this idea that the miners are at the mercy of the community, who can "fire" them, and therefore the correct response to their whining is to ignore them until they get in line and start running segwit.  This is not only disrespectful to the miners, who after all secure the network for us, but also a fantasy.  It is **much** easier for a few big miners to start running code that coerces the main chain to bigger blocks, say via an ["evil" soft fork]( than for the rest of us to coordinate a response - which would likely need to be a hard fork.
    Of course in any such scenario both miners and the community would lose a lot, which is what's stopped it from happening so far.  But the idea that people won't do mutually destructive things, therefore you can make them do whatever you want, is called blackmail.  A more promising approach for resolving an impasse is **respectful negotiation.**  How many people in this community have even engaged or about their concerns?
    In short, Satoshi's own 51% design gives the miners the power to change the block size.  It would be more constructive to implement that power in a thought-out, consensus-preserving way like BU's, than to antagonize them to the point where they use blunter methods (a hard/evil soft fork rather than BU's preference-signaling).  Especially if the alternative is a philosophically pure, decentralized network nobody uses.
