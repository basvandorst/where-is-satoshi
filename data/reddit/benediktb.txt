Technically you can do a quantum resistant zero knowledge proof e.g a STARK to transfer your coins. Would be expensive but perhaps actually doable

Proof System | Proof Size | Verification Time | Trusted Setup
SNARKs | O(1) ~bytes | O(1) ~10ms | Yes
STARKs | O(log(n)) &gt;200kb | O(log(n)) | No
Bulletproofs | O(log(n)) &lt;2kb | O(n/log(n)) | No
The asymptotics hide a lot of constants that matter in practice and there are more considerations like assumptions and prover complexity

The utxo set is the state of the Bitcoin blockchain. In ethereum the state is more complex. Computers without any storage will be able to fully verify every block and also mine. They would essentially be equal to full nodes today.

Additionally the archival requirements can be split among many nodes.

I hope that at some point I'll be able to give a recorded technical talk on this explaining the details of the protocol. For this audience it felt more appropriate to highlight its properties and applications.

Hardly any of the cryptography used in crypto currencies today is quantum secure. A quantum computer could for example easily create a forged signature and spend someone else’s money. BPs rely on the same assumption as these signature schemes and have even weaker (weaker=better) assumptions than SNARKs which are used in ZCash. The problem in confidential currencies like ZCash/Monero/Mimblewimble/CT is that creating a fake proof allows you to create money out of thin air. And unlike a forged signature no one would be able to tell because everything is confidential. So clearly this is a problem but it is also very important to remember that a) general quantum computers don’t exist b) they probably won’t exist any time soon c) a lot of other things like all of TLS/SSL would break down at that point. If the security of crypto currencies is a greater concern at that point than the security of online banking and the internet as a whole, then we will have come a long way.

The newest number indicate that bach verifying bulletproofs is between 0 and 4 times slower than verifying an ECDSA signature. That definitely brings it in the realm of practicality. We'll post an update to the paper tomorrow.

That there exists a function that is hard to invert. You actually need a bit more but in practice any secure hash function should suffice. Yes and all but log(n) of them will be.

Because floor(log(51))=floor(log(64)). Basically the proofs wouldn’t be shorter if we used 51 or 48 bits and the proof system is easier to reason about for powers of 2. The general proof system is indeed based on arithmetic circuits. You can read the paper  and/or watch my talk at BPASE

You are right that an ECC break would break Bitcoin's signature algorithm and in general would be very problematic to all cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately you can't really "remove the signing feature" as how else are transactions authorized. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will have to move to quantum secure signing operations once/if an ECC break seems imminent/happens. However, there are a few additional issues with confidential transactions: 
1st An ECC break would not be publicly visible. 
2nd If you are able to create silent inflation you can effectively steal from everyone even if their keys are not vulnerable to quantum attacks
3rd If standard peddersen \(perfectly hiding/computationally binding\) commitments are used then a quantum computer can open them to any possible value. Even an honest user can't convince an honest verifier that he committed to some value in a peddersen commitments if quantum computers suddenly exists. So if quantum computers exists there is no way to open the confidential amounts and the whole system breaks down. 
This last point which is the scariest in my opinion can be somewhat mitigated. The idea is something called a switch commitment: [ and we describe in the paper how it can be used with Bulletproofs.
