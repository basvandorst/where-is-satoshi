Do you not understand how stock shares work?

But then he wouldn't be able to brag about it to all the cryptodouches here
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:08:42
If you care about the price at all, you are probably a speculator. If you actually want it to be used as currency, it should be constant, or inflate slightly.
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:41:34
No, since bitcoin markets are unregulated.
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:14:12
But it doesn't have to be illegal for it to be seized (civil forfeiture)
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:01:17
There is no such thing as a centralized blockchain. They are attempting to use blockchain as a buzzword.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:29:19
But the asset doesn't have to be BTC. If it's leveraged, that means it's using BTC futures most likely.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:08:54
Because it wasn't public until now?
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:59:09
That is not true, you have no clue what you are talking about. The crash was due to hedge funds trading derivatives, causing banks to give loans to subprime borrowers.
Bitcoin does not attempt to fix these problems, or anything like it.
A crash will never occur again for 2008's reasons as long as proper regulation prevents credit speculation.

"Bitcoin might grow two legs and spread them this year"
All you idiots need to start thinking, not just blindly following when people throw out numbers.

They are also not located physically in Hong Kong.
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:06:30
Not really
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:15:07
The peso has not lost 20% of it's value in last month. Stop spreading false information.
Edit: the peso has also not lost 20% over the last "months" either.  From it's peak in Jul to its dip in Dec it has lost ~12%. However, it is still up ~11% over the last year.

A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger that uses hashing to help secure records. Things that cryptocurrencies include, such as proof of work, proof of stake, etc. are not required for a blockchain at all.
Distributed ledgers have been around for decades. Leslie Lamport (famous computer scientist, turning award winner) researched distributed ledgers in the 70s and 80s. Blockchains are not anything new or cutting edge. They are still succeptable to the same problems that all decentralized systems face.

You mean when the dollar was very stable?

Bitfinex isn't in Hong Kong, they are in British Virgin Isles.

And all Bitcoin owners get a supermodel to jerk them off? Come on, don't be silly.

Yes, he paid in a real currency that is accepted by all, backed and protected by the government.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:36:59
Debt is incredibly important for an economy to function. It allows people to access opportunities that they normally wouldn't, and take risks without depleting emergency reserves. You have an ignorant view.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:19:41
It's not optimistic- it's ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:22:02
That is exactly what it is- it's a speculative commodity.
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:58:11
That's only if you want to connect to your bank directly via login. You also can just give the account # like normal.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:20:30
But it adds the work and hassle to manually sell it when you need the money.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:28:54
Or perhaps listen to them, if they actual present serious facts about Bitcoin's scaling problems (which they do). 
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:22:45
The majority of the nodes being in a data center doesn't make it centralized. If there is even 1 replicated node that is not central, the system still requires full-fledged distributed consensus.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:11:56
Yes, if bitcoin's price actually reflected it's real value. But bitcoin's price is purely speculative, not based in reality at all.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:29:06
Gold is a speculative commodity, not a currency
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:18:53
You absolutely should.

The stock market went up during the last shutdown.
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:51:04


@_date: 2018-01-08 01:24:26
Uh, no. You obviously don't grasp what a blockchain really is (it has nothing to do with cryptocurrency)
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:07:49
Wow, posts about a market attract people interested in finance? Shiver me timbers.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:13:06
Talk some sense into him.
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:38:51
A speculative commodity
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:03:31
It has no value. Pure speculation, like beanie babies, except worse.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:06:06
Don't waste your money dude. This bubble is going to pop eventually, don't get caught up in it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:45:24
It is still taxable.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:44:49
Make sure you remember to pay taxes on it...
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:09:13
It's because bitcoin's transactions are costly and slow, making it useless as a currency.
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:15:02
So rude...

@_date: 2017-11-24 19:33:38
In the Bitcoin world, the wallets just get hacked and the markets "lose" your money. Don't pretend like Bitcoin is secure.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:54:41
That's not how it works...
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:36:46
Yes, that's exactly what people were assuming. Did you see this subreddit back in December? "Bitcoin is going to be 100k in a few months!!!1!!!"
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:56:30
Concerns about 1billion Tether being printed in ~35 days is apparently "FUD"...
If any of you guys actually give a shit about the future of Bitcoin, you would understand that Tether is dangerous.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:57:09
If by "it" you mean Tether, I don't use it, but it will negatively impact the crypto markets. If by "it" you mean Bitcoin, I also don't use it. No reason to, I can buy everything with dollars just fine.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:58:46
...and now ~780k.
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:02:48
Did *you* read the article? It says they are going with Adyen in it.


But nothing pointing towards crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:16:22


Do you not understand that buying/selling is what drives at the price? If the price maxed out at 19k and went to 10k, that means people bought the way up, and sold the way down. There are LOTS of people who have paper losses right now, and many cut their losses early before it dropped to 10k.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:47:51
It impacts the crypto market ecosystem.
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:17:17
...unless you bought in December, which a lot of people did.
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:28:41
Uh, no it's not
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:17:47
(1) Inflation is incredibly important for the economy, since it allows people with fixed rate debt to pay it off easier
(2) Inflation is usually not significant, since most money you are saving long term should be going into the market.
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:17:44
Proof-of-work is outdated. If Bitcoin doesn't change this, it will fall behind compared to other cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:35:43
Yep, the universally accepted government backed currency is definitely a scam
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:02:47
Nice advice...
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:23:16


@_date: 2018-02-24 19:59:45
No, not all of them did something wrong. Depends on how each one filed taxes over the last few years.
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:13:21
That answer is different than other answers given in this thread, do you have a source?
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:01:32
Hopefully none of you guys listened to him...
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:03:03
I've never bought bitcoin before, but after the crash I signed up on Coinbase... without realizing the card verification takes 2 days. It's already up by 800 :(
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:20:53
The data was for 2013 - 2015. Did you realize any gains during those years? Did you report the gains on your taxes? If yes and no, then you owe the government money.
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:00:01
Or more accurate: Bitcoin owners treat it like a speculative commodity and care about the market price, not actually using it as currency
It's funny how a community that bashes fiat cares *so so much* about the price of Bitcoin in fiat. Because they all know they will cash out eventually...
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:50:10
It's a lot harder. You have to provide services that involve the open source software. Red Hat is the best example.

If even a single american is buying into an ICO, then the SEC gets to regulate it among americans.
