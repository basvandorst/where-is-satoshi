If your Lucky i managed to buy 2 btg at 70usd and sell on bittrex for 450usd but when i tried to go back with my 450 in Bitcoin for more btg all crashed but took the 700usd home �� so it's defently possible to make money switching but the delay is killing ,if there was now delay i would turn 2 btg in 1 million dollars in 7 cycles

Anycoindirect to buy sell and coinomi as wallet + Paper wallets
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:58:42
It's what the coinomi app accepted as normal. I was sending them from my Paper wallets to coinomi at 200sats but was so afraid to get into a limbo with all my savings i let coinomi decide i took the normal fee .
It was 650 sats normal and 1000 sats high priority
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:20:56
With these transaction costs you need to make 1 good placed investment buying small Parts could cost you a Fortune in fees
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:25:12
Use anycoindirect and coinify ,instant but limited day amount to buy ,but at least you can get in with 700usd per 24 hour

Paper wallets are safe just don't lose your key ,split your coin in multiple Paper wallets so you only load Parts in a wallet online at a time and keep the rest safe

I spread the gospel to 900 million People in 10 min
What i did is tell my story in the comment box of the biggest Instagram accounts being followed by 200million for example Ariane grande.....i think this way we can get billions of People Involved in the real Bitcoin .what can you do ? Wel exactly the same go to your Instagram and start comenting every high profile picture with a nice comment about there great car or look but throw in that you love Bitcoin and hope to be as rich as them and one day meet them bla bla bla you get the picture .
The Point is this is a great way to spread the gospel and get more of the young generation Involved .So upvote if you like my strategy and go post some Bitcoin info don't spread fud or fomo just awareness about it's existence and growth so far

That's what i said 2 create awerenes not fomo just give People a heads up a status update as no mainstream media ever covers Bitcoin here ,and the new generation does not watch tv or read they live on social media so that's the only way for us to really advertise and free for that mather
