I dm you can you help me a little? Just a little neive. Hard to research this and what the difference is..  Someone told me it just avoids btc fees... Lmk if u got mg msg 
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:44:03
Damn.... Uhh.. Pls
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:58:48
Makes sense.. True.. As long as it isn't a fee and actually a minimum.. I just wish they update it and let you know before purchasing and waiting for it to clear 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:32:43
Thank you. All I needed to know 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:57:41
I'm just making sure it's a minimum and not a fee. So if I transfer it.. It's not a $20 fee but just a minimum right! 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:25:08
I understand but I tried to withdraw before maintenence which allowed me but then it said a minimum BTc withdrawal is $40 usd now
.. 
I've withdrew $20 twice and now it's $40 minimum?? What's going on?
Plus I also thought it states 30 free withdrawal per calendar date

I used to have CB but got banned. I remember it was instant BTc though 
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:21:47
I mean I know BTc exchanges that give it instantly like coinbase which I can't use no need to explain...
But the fact my funds already cleared. Not a huge issue but I'm just asking.. 
When you buy something isn't it fair that once your money is cleared from your bank, you should get it?
I mean I already showed them a picture within 2nd day payment cleared.. No reply 2 days later 
I know I will be able to withdraw in a day or two but my I already mentioned my point... 
Of course you can say "just wait.. Read details" I'm just mentioning my funds already got deducted from my bank...
Next time I might as well just wire.. Apparently it's instant but my bank can fee 30 bucks so... Still better than most exchanges

Thank you. Im aware I can buy BTc.. Just wanna know the days I can use them.. So thank you 
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:07:54
Right yes im aware.. Just curious why my payment from bofa cleared in 2 days.. Id assume it would be much fair if you could withdraw right after it clears. Ty though friend 
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:09:38
Understood. I'd just assume it's much more fair, if bank clears, then you can use the BTc.. But hey... The fee is so low compared to other shit.. So I'm not complaining 
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:58:54
Well Im just saying. Avoid those sites. The only ones that are good to sell is directly to a site that buys BTc where the site owner is the one paying you or don't use PayPal at all
@_date: 2017-06-25 00:14:47
Thanks... Any paypal ones from sites other than bitquick and LBC? 
@_date: 2017-06-24 21:52:08
Yes but aren't they so overpriced? I seen their prices it's outrageous.... Maybe I'm looking at the wrong thing.. Can u reply back please 
@_date: 2017-06-25 01:09:43
Fuck xCoins I'm never selling with them.. When you ask "I thought you said I can get refunded using evidence" 
They say "but we never said guaranteed" 
NO shit but don't be an asshole about it. So many people lost money from that site
 Yeah its wrong I had revenge probably on innocent people but I'm proving my point to the company that they should not really allow paypal since paypal doesn't support virtual goods 
@_date: 2017-06-25 00:38:28
I see you're point.. I have bought bitcoins from direct sites like xCoins for a while but they closed my account cause when I sold BTc someone did a chargeback. 
So I had the person's info and everything pics of id they gave me etc. And I lost.. 
I was pissed... 
So I bought like 300 bucks worth and I filed a claim to spite them. This was almost 2 years cause I lost about the same amount so fuck them. They can do nothing now. 
I used to buy from we sell crypto. Com also but they don't have a source anymore. 
My bank didn't even question me when they see those purchases. Sometimes I'll call and they'll read it to me. 
3 years I've been buying BTc even from coinbase but coinbase banned me not my bank. 
But no nothing illegal of course not. ��
Seriously nothing illegal. Things like cheap  Kratom isn't illegal. Just the site ��
