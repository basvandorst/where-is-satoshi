Those solutions would have been ready if developers didn't have to waste time preparing for a fork that didn't even happen. Unfortunately I'm not a good enough developer to work on scaling solutions, but I have contributed (a tiny bit) to Bitcoin Core before it was even called that. I'm more concerned about newbies being duped into losing money with BCH and being put off the whole crypto space.

I noticed it the other day, there is at least 1 wallet that simply sets fees to "higher than everyone else". It is almost certainly causing fees to rise faster than necessary during congestion as well.

I don't think they're partnering. More likely that nicehash has a coinbase account and is using the api to process withdrawals.

That explains the aftermath, but not the 230+ high fee TX within seconds. I'm saying that someone is gaming the bad fee estimation in order to drive them higher.

Mouse pointer didn't show up in the screenshot. I'm referring to the spike in the blue area left of the table. The burst of 1000+ sat/byte transactions totaled over 8 BTC in fees. The next block mined all of those transactions, but they managed to get wallets to continue sending 1000+ sat/byte transactions as well as 1400+ sat/byte transactions, **which were empty** before the burst!
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:07:24

@_date: 2017-12-22 19:12:50
Certainly rising faster than necessary. I've been watching since last night and you can get into the next block reliably with 1000, but the highest bin keeps rising because some wallet is simply paying higher than everyone rather than what's needed to get into the next block.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:29:21
They have the benefit of starting with a much newer wallet format (BIP44 HD Wallets), that use a separate derivation path for each type of address (legacy, p2sh, bech32) The core wallet has to maintain backwards compatibility with a much older format where you don't know which type of address each private key was used for.

The locktime of the transaction is a 32-bit integer. If the number is lower than 500000000, it's interpreted as a block height and the transaction is locked until that height. If the number higher, it's interpreted as a timestamp and the transaction is locked until that time.

It's a little hard to create a new wallet with it, but electrum supports P2SH segwit. You have to restore a BIP39 seed and use the m/49'/0'/0' derivation path.

During low fee times, add a small UTXO to a larger transaction even if it isn't necessary for the amount you're sending. Make sure your change address is segwit. Fees are typically lowest on Sundays.
@_date: 2015-12-15 06:59:05
But, it's interpreted as a block height if it's under 500,000,000, so you can approximate for the next 9500 years
((500 000 000 - 388 493) * 10) * minutes =

See spec: 
The locktime can be either a block height or a block time. If the value is under 500,000,000 it's a height, if over, it's a timestamp.

Big difference here is the fact that an IPv6 upgrade requires switching out millions of routers and network switches in order to upgrade, while going to a 2MB fork for the majority of nodes is simple software change.

Looks like he was having server issues and no idea about how to route or configure a high availability server on tor. So he throws more hardware at it and possibly compromises his anonymity. I truely hope he wasn't actually trying to run his own introduction and guard nodes...
Basic proper way to do it:
**VALN1**: Internet
**VLAN2**: Private tor-only network
**VM1**. Tor Router
 * Connects: VLAN1, VLAN2
 * Default gateway for VLAN2
 * only box with public ip
 * routes all outer traffic through tor.
 * all ports closed to VLAN2, only routes packets through tor, no other information can be leaked in.
**VMx**. All your other servers, assuming 3 for bitcoind, application, and database.
 * Only connected to VLAN2
 * all traffic is routed through Tor router, 
 * zero chance of leaking any public IP since it has no public ip.
For higher availability and load balancin, those can be inserted between the router and any server, and by adding additional tor routers on more uplinks, but everything needs to be behind one, and no public ips on anything except the router. Everything should scale fairly well if set up correctly.

With pruning, it shouldn't be an issue in a couple years. Hard drives keep getting bigger and network connections keep getting faster. I torrented more than 1.5TB daily for a week while I was converting my media collection to 1080p so it's certainly possible on a home connection.

One benefit of payment protocol is that your output can be an arbitrary script, so one could use it to receive to a bech32 address from wallets that support payment protocol but not bech32.

The idea that your ISP could ever afford to store all your transmitted data is silly. In a typical month I generate 3-4TB of traffic, around 80-90% of which is encrypted and can't be deduplicated with other users. I pay a bill of around $50 a month, while a 4TB hard drive costs &gt;$100, so my ISP would be losing &gt;$50 a month archiving my traffic. No sane business would try to do this.

Could be as simple as polling if a file on a usb stick exists every 200ms and locking and shutting down if not.

AUTORENEW people.... This isn't the first time a major bitcoin domain expired.

It links to weusecoins.com

Please add yourself on  .

About to CNC convert my mill soon. First thing I'm doing with it is milling a QR code into a block of stainless steel.

With a large chain like Applebees, I'd bet the POS system is custom, integrating bitcoin shouldn't be an issue when you're already developing a custom tablet app.

Are the 2 missing together or in separate locations?
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:35:57
First bits only exist after the address has been used.

They can chase him forever, but all he has to do is keep it in bitcoin, and only take a little bit out, mix it, and spend it.

Could this open a huge arb opportunity between MtGox and BTCChina?

I visit nashville occasionally, will have to check this out!

yes, mph.

From keyloggers... no actual data breech. Just more people that can't secure their own computers.
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:13:51
Why don't they just buy the bitcoin now, so they don't have to worry about it... Unless thats just an excuse to keep the money if it goes up too much.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:14:11
Litecoin, maybe, but they aren't making anything mining bitcoins with any kind of GPU or motherboard...

Aaahhh, metro store link... Haven't seen that screen since I installed Start8.
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:15:54
Pretty obvious choices.
I **HATE** urinals without the dividing walls...
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:55:30
Looks like I could probably get it working if I borrowed from the trezor code repos, their using a similar chip... Might try at some point, although I have no idea how it'd work if I ever wanted to sell them.
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:06:13
Google translated, but...
"(only charge fees of 1% +1 million)."
1 million what? satoshis, I hope...
@_date: 2013-02-19 03:16:20
more importantly, when does it become more difficult to solve it than to mine the same amount of bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:14:06
Theres little to no security check for private planes...
@_date: 2013-03-02 22:50:36
make it a script that gives a new address every time, then people can't see your old transfers
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:41:13
Where is this dealership? I do all the maintenance on mine and will order parts from them if they are local or ship.
With all these dealerships starting to accept bitcoin, we need to support them, even if you live across the country ORDER YOUR PARTS FROM THEM instead of the local dealer. More will consider accepting it if the hear of parts orders coming in from everywhere.

I felt the same way at $32, $266... Just hold, you'll be glad you did in a few months. These bubbles just build character.
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:48:35
I bought a ton of these when they had the free shipping sale

Gift cards don't usually have a name on them, so theres really no way for them to tell its your own card.

What if its American? I've seen it spelt both ways...

Difference between bitcoin and stocks is that you can't buy 0.1 shares of a stock.

It scans fine with my android. Even if its flipped, all you'd have to do is take a picture of it and flip it back over, then scan it off your screen. I also have the base58 key etched under it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:02:30
I'll show mine off, but its all in an offline wallet, in a hidden safe, protected by my large gun collection. You'd have a better chance of surviving robbing a bank.
@_date: 2013-04-27 00:55:36
Also wondering the same thing. I'd like to check it out if its still there when I'm passing through.

All my domains have auto-renew, turn it on.
