It looks like around $12,800 is where the major resistence line is set right now. That's where the buy walls tend to be erected if it dips down to 13K.

Bringing up computers is a good point, because adoption started when we moved from the technically oriented text-based terminal clients to easy to use GUI elements.
Early emailing was done through writing commands in terminal programs, while today we don't even need to think about addresses much because you just click "add to contact" and have an address book.

Binance doesn't, Bittrex only does wire transfers to tether. Best way to get money in is Gemini.

Man things were different back then, it seems quaint now. I remember worrying back in 2013 that my 7970's would overheat and cause my whole room to catch on fire. Having to cut out holes in my case and put in Noctua fans on the outside to get more air in. I had a really high end card prior to that and it fried from overheating, it made me paranoid about temps. GPUs today are much cooler and more efficient. Maybe not Vega but Pascal runs cool and also there are really good coolers today from all the manufacturers. Back then my stock clocked 7970 cards ran at 85C if I left them running for more than a few hours, and forget overclocking.  I had to buy an Accelero Xtreme ($300 for 2 back then) to put on them, and I was nervous as hell taking the cooler off and putting on the new one.

For Bitcoin you should ideally hold it in a wallet, preferably a hardware one if you have substantial holdings. I had a Trezor since 2015 and I highly recommend it.
For trading the best overall exchange is Binance right now. Gemini is pretty good too, especially for large volumes as you can do auctions. Bittrex is pretty good overall, even if it tends to go down more than I like.
For getting fiat in you really shouldn't be using credit cards and Coinbase. Get bank transfers into the exchange. Yes it takes 3 days but its free and you avoid the crazy Coinbase fees.

Right now wallet to wallet transaction UX is ridiculous for micropayments. All the decimal places make no sense to even smarter-than-average and more-tolerant-than-average people. 
I can't stress just how much the current UX experience keeps Bitcoin (and pretty much any crypto) from widespread adoption. Imagine paying for a meal in your local restaurant. “How would you like to pay?” the waiter asks. To this you reply, “Bitcoin, please”. The waiter goes to the cash register and says “that’ll be 0.000724666 Bitcoin, please.” How do you know that’s the correct amount? Do you open up a BTC to Fiat convertor or accept that the barman is probably right (or not deliberately deceiving you) and didn’t put the decimal point in the wrong place? The more obscure the number is, the more vulnerable to human error everyday transactions become. Constantly wondering if they have overpaid won’t exactly make users feel satisfied.
Any technology will need to pass the "can grandma use it?" test before it gets big, and right now the entire process is far too oriented towards the technically literate. There needs to be a big green payment button that says Pay Now and be much more intuitive. Its still far too cumbersome and manual compared to VISA or Paypal. And QR codes themselves aren't a good solution either, lots of people don't want to have to scan things to pay and many don't even know what a QR scanner is. It gets even more complicated because certain wallets will only work with specific QR scanners. And you can't have two similar gibberish strings for the public and private key, it confuses the shit out of people because they forget which one is which.
Hell I myself feel nervous every time I move crypto between exchanges and I've been doing this since 2012. Did I copy-paste the right address? Did I accidently not select the last character? For the non-technical the whole concept will be way too intimidating when you can just enter a simple to understand username and password in a intuitive UI and pay with Paypal.
And other cryptocurrencies are even more of a pain. I recently tried to set up a ZCL wallet because I bought some in mid December because of the airdrop of BTCP to ZClassic owners. It was such a fucking pain, and I wouldn't have figured it out if it wasn't for an obscure post on the ZClassic subreddit and after hanging up variables in a config file. I've had similar shitty experiences with setting up several other wallets.

I hope so, but realistically speaking it will take some time.
According to LN developers themselves, Lightning wont be here for another 1-2 years. The problem is user adoption. Segwit gave users a 40% discount on fees, and was a relatively simple upgrade, yet its 2018 and only [8% of transactions come from Segwit addresses]( LN is way more difficult to implement, so don't expect it to be useful for at least a year after release.

Yes, I've used Gemini for large fiat withdrawls. Make sure you contact your bank and explain that you have full tracability for your crypto holdings and that you sold them at Gemini and there shouldn't be any problem. Their daily withdrawl limit is $100,000 USD.
Gemini is great in general because they use batches and also have large lot auctions. Probably one of the most professional exchanges.

Be thankful we have a period of stability. 
If the Tether QE scam finally unwinds (and it possibly might in the next few months now that Friedman LLP has broke off and they can't use their consulting report as evidence of "auditing"), then you'll long for sideways movement.

For grandma it is. Especially if the mobile wallet requires a specific QR scanner. 
My dad likely has no idea what a QR code even is, or what he would need to do if he saw one. And he's fairly tech literate.

I mined 52 Bitcoins back the using my bitchin' Radeon 7970 with an Arctic Accelero Xtreme custom cooler on it. I remember thinking whether getting a custom cooler is worth the expense, whether mining would be worth it, or whether I should just use it for gaming. 
I felt like a genius when I sold half of the BTC at $2,000....
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:33:15
At this point its basically become gambling.

What do you think is the likelihood of a genuine Coinbase competitor coming out in 2018? I mean a real gateway for fiat that is easy enough for the normie to use, not something like Gemini?
I fear that that at this point Coinbase has a natural monopoly and that its only going to get worse unless we get a solid competitor to come in fast.

Like many early adopters and miners, he probably sold early to recoup his investment. I myself sold 25 BTC I mined for $2K and felt like a genius, it was way more than the coolers I bought for the GPUs so I could mine without worrying about temps. Back then we were mining more to support the functioning of the network too than getting rich off it.
I decided to keep the remaining 27 BTC thankfully.

This all happened overnight, now the Coinbase noobs are going to wake up and check their balance to see it go down 40% and panic sell, further feeding the downward pressure.

This is a really bad arguement, the energy that bank branches use is not entirely dedicated to validating ledger transactions. They offer a massive amount of services from lending to merchant services to investment analysis.

This is actually a really interesting use case and I really want to see this type of adoption. 
Imagine in the future an autonomous car that goes through a toll terminal on a highway and automatically communicates its ID to the scanner at the terminal without even stopping. The ID is linked to a LN payment channel so that the microtransaction is paid between two autonomous AI (car and toll system), completely trustless and decentralized from any system build by the actual toll operator. All without you needing to be bothered with cash or the toll company needing to hire some guy to sit at the toll booth all day stamping tickets.

If you ever feel bad about this price drop, just remember that Bitcoin lost 85% of its value in 2013 and then didn't recover for fucking 3 years.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:09:15
Just like the price history of Bitcoin over the last year

[I currently have a short position on BTC @ 11K](
Give me a good bull case on why there won't be more downward selling pressure in the next month. Do you see any big announcements coming up?
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:22:11
The concensus is that we are going to 20K within the next 3 hours then 4K by evening.

Isn't telling people to make transactions on the Lightning Network effectively the same as telling them to make transactions with some other cryptocurrency instead of Bitcoin?
Doesn't that lower the demand for Bitcoins to use in transactions, thereby decreasing the price from where it would otherwise be?
I'm a bit skeptical that LN will work seamlessly or add truly desirable functionality, and I'm even more skeptical that it will do anything to help with merchant adoption - which is clearly the path forward for Bitcoin's long-term success.
But for argument's sake, even if LN was wildly successful to those ends, wouldn't its use just drive down the Bitcoin price from where it would otherwise be, effectively cannibalizing the value of the coin?
Someone might argue that LN increases the value of BTC by adding "features", but this seems silly for two reasons:
1. It's not like people are buying Bitcoin so they can use LN. They are using LN so they can use their Bitcoin.
2. Any other crypto can just adopt LN, if it really does add value (which seems a bit doubtful) thereby taking any LN "advantage" away from BTC...if there does turn out to be one at all.
So I ask why wouldn't LN just drive down the price of any properly-working crypto, relative to where it would otherwise be according to Gresham's Law?

HODL is a valid strategy as long as the long term price target you have based on whatever valuation model you're using is higher than the current market price. When the recent price action outstrips your long term valuation expectations, it makes no sense to HODL.
Here is a little protip:  Sell high, buy low
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:17:07
[Just relax and HODL on](
