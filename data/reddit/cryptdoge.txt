"They can probably just go".
lol...You get years hard labor if you get caught in Mexico without permission.  
Drug cartels are spilling over the border due to the illegal drug war, and thousands are dying on both sides of the border. You should allow 5 or 6 of them to stay at your house if you are so charitable.  We can't afford to give welfare to the entire world. The illegals get away with everything, the cops in sactuary cities are told to release them for drunk driving and other crimes. Stop wrecking our country.  
Then there is this gem of them scamming billions of fake tax returns for children that don't even live in America:  
Having fun getting taxed half your earnings if you want to start a business?? Well its your own fault for allowing illegals in to wreck America.

They use illegal immigrant workers as excuses to seize hotels and other property also.

That is why the genesis block contains an article from that day titled something like "On the verge of another banker bailout".  Obviously Satoshi and the Creators were libertarians.  But all the government lovers here hate that fact, and want to change the bitcoin community into a communist government regulation loving circlejerk.

Hopefully they will have Andreas Antonopoulos on the show soon to educate them.  I have been e-mailing them about this for a while.
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:38:47
I don't think so.  The guy was warning about everything like the NSA for years, and everyone called him a whackjob.  Now he is proven right, yet he didn't do it eh?? And Obama said we didn't build that also.
@_date: 2014-08-05 07:56:21
He doesn't believe in chemtrails.  Yes the government and some corporations did geo-engineering and weather modification experiments, but its not like every pilot is flipping a switch to spray poisons on people.  There are some whacko chemtrail folks that probably are listeners.  Infowars has even debunked some of these whacky conspiracies, here is an example 
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:32:22
Seems he is pretty successful in the free market.  If all his stuff is tinfoil froth, you would think he would go out of business.
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:42:15
Climate change is a hoax.  The CIA created and funded Al Qaeda.  Bin Laden was on the CIA payroll, his code name Tim Osman.  Obama's birth certificate was fake.  Probably to disguise that his true father is a communist pornographer named Frank Marshall Davis, and his mom was a porno star and part of the CIA.    
@_date: 2014-08-05 05:02:13
He is not racist at all. He is very including of all races. It is defamation to call him racist.
@_date: 2014-08-04 23:41:50
@_date: 2014-08-05 05:27:33
Very true, if people do not like his style, do not throw the baby out with the bath water.  Find someone else presenting similar information in a style you like. If he says something that sounds far out, research it, and you will probably find out it is true.
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:58:22
Actually I do, as I have interacted heavily with them. I am also a listener. I have had huge debates with other infowarriors about bitcoin. There are a few who understand and support bitcoin, but the vast majority of his listeners hate it and think it is some mark of the beast currency and is a ponzi scheme because you can't hold it in your hand. Also they think it was created by the NSA with backdoors in the encryption.
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:55:52
He is smart, and his show is causing a revolution in the media industry because he covers things that the mainstream controlled bought-and-paid-for media won't.  The guy is having huge success.  He has over 400 million youtube views, and now he will be plugging bitcoin.  Bitcoiners are smart as well, which is why this is on the front page.  Bitcoiners love libertarianism and love Ron Paul, and Alex Jones does as well.  The Alex Jones Show was one of the main outlets that helped Ron Paul and Rand Paul gain a lot of followers. Alex was the one who convinced Rand Paul to start his political career. Bitcoiners and Infowarriors/Alex Jones fans have a lot in common.  It is a match made in heaven really.
@_date: 2014-08-05 08:05:09
How is selling products make him a con-artists?? Is all free market capitalism evil?? He is trying to make money while pushing producsts he believes in, to fund his media operation. I can't speak for the quality of his producsts as I have never tried them.  If you don't like his products don't buy it.  Don't lie and call him a con-artist.
@_date: 2014-08-05 10:26:19
He says he was never against it, he says he underestimated the power of the people, and he said that bitcion and crypto currency is a beautiful idea.
Here is the announcement at the 19:30 mark: 
@_date: 2014-08-05 10:11:18
Seems like his media operation is growing at a very fast rate, while the mainstream media is dying and losing credibility.  Free market at work?
@_date: 2014-07-23 00:36:15
Coindesk is a propaganda outfit to give you some good articles and useful news, while sprinkling it with pro-regulation propaganda.  The head of coindesk has said on TechChunch that he believes bitcoiners are like children and that they need "adult supervision" and regulation.  Check the 11:00 minute mark: watch?v=Tume6vspgeg
@_date: 2014-08-05 10:18:15
Maybe you should actually research some facts before you troll people and call things moronic.  You are obviously clueless.
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:30:45
If they are snakeoil, then people won't buy it, and they will be forced to stop selling it, because they will lose money.  Its called free market capitalism.  I know it is a strange concept in this modern communist era.
@_date: 2014-08-05 07:50:59
A lot of people believe in Creationism.  They don't believe that life appeared out of nothing.  They believe in a Creator or God or Intelligent Design.  You can disagree if you want, but its not like Alex Jones believes species cant evolve and change over time.  Like tall parents have tall children.  You make him to be some whacko because of his religious or philosophical beliefs, and you are not telling the whole story.
@_date: 2014-08-05 04:57:12
He has a lot of accurate predictions, including he predicted 9/11 before it happened.  Months before it happened he predicted they would attack the World Trade Center using their CIA asset Bin Laden in a false flag attack.  
@_date: 2014-08-05 05:11:51
In my experience, most of his listeners do not understand bitcoin and are paranoid about it being the mark of the beast currency.  They don't realize that bitcoin does not require permission from anyone.  They are definitely gold and silver types, and if they could ever wrap their head around bitcoin they would love it.
@_date: 2014-08-05 10:05:56
Hopefully pro-regulation, communist, Obama lovers won't tarnish the bitcoin community, by begging for regulation that makes bitcoin illegal.
@_date: 2014-08-05 07:00:57
To be fair, he never said that.  He was always just skeptical and had questions about who invented it, but said he thought it was an revolutionary idea.  A lot of bitcoiners were skeptical at first, I wouldn't call him an idiot for that.  The guy seems pretty smart, with a lot of views similar to Ron Paul, and in line with most bitcoiners.
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:28:14
I think I will buy some of his products soon, with bitcoin!!
@_date: 2014-08-05 07:06:20
Alex never said.
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:43:35
He never said it is staged, he just asked questions about it.  But I guess we are no longer allowed to question government known liars.
@_date: 2014-08-05 07:41:42
Here is the video of the announcement, starts at 19:30 mark: 
Alex says "I have never been against bitcoin.  I just underestimated the power of the people to defeat all the government attacks, and propaganda.  And, so now its such a protest movement, that even though they have driven it down a few times, it keeps going back up...That obviously...I guess if the mainstream has been forced to use it, that InfowarsStore.com will start using it."
He also says "This crypto-currency, the idea is beautiful, but I was just worried about the Providence"
@_date: 2014-08-04 23:36:51
No World Wars ever happened before fiat currency.
@_date: 2014-08-05 10:38:38
Everybody knows the CIA created and funds Al Qaeda: 
Obama is still funding Al Qaeda to this day: 
But yeah nothing to see here, except some total schizos.  I can't believe there exist people as dumb as you.

Did you study under Professor Bitcorn?
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:48:03
No they don't they run tax return scams.  They pay zero taxes, then file tax returns to get billions of dollars for free from the government. Bitcoin market cap is only 8 billion. And nobody is stopping it, because of idiots like you:
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:35:26
He said they will implement it in the next 2 weeks.  Probably they are using coinbase or bitpay.
@_date: 2014-08-05 10:08:19
Whenever I research the things he says, it always turns out to be true.  I think you are the one that is a liar, you anti-libertarian communist.
@_date: 2014-08-05 05:41:18
Go over to Mexico, and see if they treat you as a human being.
@_date: 2014-08-05 07:03:50
Everything he predicted in the Obama Deception came true.  He is not a liar at all.  He understood things better than most and was able to predict it all with astounding accuracy.  For those that haven't seen the Obama Deception I highly recommend it on youtube.  Remember the documentary was made BEFORE Obama's presidency.  Amazing the guy could see everything coming.
@_date: 2014-08-05 10:15:26
It shows the level of brainwashing of the public, when they can corrupt a term like "conspiracy", and attach it to the label of an insane whackjob.
@_date: 2014-08-05 10:32:40
"People like him"??....he is a libertarian and constitutionalist.  His views are almost the exact same as Ron Paul.  Do you like MSNBC, CNN, and the mainstream media better?
@_date: 2014-08-05 04:55:02
He makes some good points. The illegals get shipped in here and then suck off of us, and we have to give them free health care and education, while our country is bankrupt.  But if you want to illegally go to Mexico you will get years of hard labor.  So we should just let all poor people of the world come here and give them all our money and jobs?  America needs to change its attitude before it can move on?? Move onto what? Move onto a complete 3rd world country?
@_date: 2014-08-05 05:31:12
To be clear, he says he believes in the technology behind vaccines, but he says he cannot trust the pharmecutical companies and the FDA.  This is because they have been caught putting cancer viruses in vaccines, like SV-40 in the polio vaccine that was given to millions of Americans...among other vaccine risks, like autism, paralysis, etc.  
@_date: 2014-08-04 23:44:17
Probably made up for PR purposes.
@_date: 2014-08-05 05:23:21
I like his presentation.  I find it very entertaining at times, but I am sure there are others who hate it.  He is right about a lot of things, and breaking a lot of news.  He is moving the Overton window in the other direction, and I like it.  Yes he is not perfect, and probably has a little ego at times, as we all do.  But its his in your face approach that also has allowed him to have so much success.
@_date: 2014-08-05 05:19:00
If he is a moron, then why did he warn us about everything before it happened?  Why was he right about the government funding and arming Al Qaeda in Libya and Syria?  Why was he right about the NSA spying scandal years before it was in maintstream news? Why was he right about TSA rolling out nation wide?  Why was he right when he predicted 9/11?  Why was he right about the Patriot Act? Why was he right when he predicted the Fast and Furious scandal?  If he is a moron, then how did he become the first one to sneak into the Bohemian grove and film their satanic rituals??  He seems pretty smart to me, now he is taking a closer look at bitcoin.  Seems like he is someone honorable and intelligent, and not a moron at all.
@_date: 2014-08-05 05:28:32
He predicted the NSA spying scandal years before it ever happened.  He also predicted 9/11 before it happened.  He predicted a multitude of things, and has broke very important stories.
@_date: 2014-08-05 05:00:21
People always try to portray him that way.  Maybe their is a shred of truth to it, he does go over the top from time to time.  Some of his followers can act a little crazy, and they don't always think for themselves.  But just because the man or his listeners are imperfect, it doesn't mean his show is not valuable or informative.  Overall his show is highly educational.
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:34:17
Which theories are incorrect or crazy?  The guy mostly asks questions and reports on the news.
@_date: 2014-08-05 10:30:35
No, fuuuuuuuck you instead.
