You could use CPFP to make a 0 BTC transaction which only carries mining fee. Miners that understand CPFP will probably pick your 0 BTC transaction to claim that fee by confirming the parent transaction that you are trying to speed up.
It's not cheap. Electrum suggested fee for that CPFP will probably be very high.
Right click the pending incoming transaction and you should see the option.

The Petro might not work as a way for Venezuelan Government to “continue transacting in USD with other countries”, because no one is willing to accept it as payment for 1 PTR ~ $60 USD. The Government would need to convince other countries selling them stuff to accept something they’ve just printed out of thin air that is not backed by anything, as not even the Gov itself has any trust left, nor the Government would be capable to even bottle the oil they say it’s redeemable for each 1 PTR. They already buy from other countries using EUR, CNY, RUB, that they get as payment for the every time lower production of oil barrels they still manage to produce.
I don’t want China to own Venezuela (ala Zimbabwe), or more than it owns it already. I don’t want the US to own it either. That’s why I promote Bitcoin and that’s why would prefer people transacting freely with each other in pure BTC.

Yeah, I’ve myself met a couple of them and I’ve explained Bitcoin to them, but they haven’t taught others in their country, nor those others have ever used Bitcoin. Actual adoption only comes with real use, even if it is small (for certain purchases, for example). People who haven’t even used it once won’t be able to learn easily when they are trapped in a situation like Turkey, Venezuela, or Iran. Education had to come first previous to the crisis, or now during the crisis, but tools for the many are inexistent.

In 2014 a political party called Podemos was born  in Spain from a group of Communist academics/professors which were previously involved in organizations advising (or receiving advice from) the Governments of Chávez (Venezuela), Correa (Ecuador), Evo Morales (Bolivia), and Kirchner’s (Argentina) economists, also to the Bank of the ALBA. Besides being in their first days directly funded by Chávez, the Bank of the ALBA, and the Government of Iran through a TV channel in Spain called HispanTV. The three co-founders were directly connected to Chávez, indeed one of them had his own office space in Miraflores palace in Caracas (Venezuelan White House).
Today that party has achieved metastasis in all systems, from teachers in schools, to police, public employees, parliaments (Spanish and European), city councils, and right now they are running part of the Spanish Government's powers through the left coalition that have kicked out the previous president months ago.

There is a BTCVEF (or now BTCVES) rate because there is actual volume of Bitcoin being sold for Bolivars in LocalBitcoins ( and p2p trades in Facebook and Telegram groups.
People and companies get paid in Bolivars everyday, so they need to turn them to other currencies, usually Dollars in foreign bank accounts, directly through p2p trades on Whatsapp, but also through Bitcoin. So they are not long in Bolivars, they receive bolivars daily and convert them almost instantly to other currencies to protect themselves from hyperinflation.
So, people who have bought Bitcoins with Bolivars need turn them back to Bolivars to be able to pay for expenses, salaries, food... There are also people who make their income in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly, from remote work, pay-to-click, captcha resolving, etc. They sell their Bitcoins for Bolivars because merchants usually only take bolivars for their products or because it is cheaper in Bolivars. 
Merchants only take Bolivars and not Dollars of cryptocurrencies openly because despite the news of announcements from the Constituent Assembly (which is an illegal entity, but it is a dictatorship anyways, who cares about “legal”), transacting in any non-Government approved exchange rate is still prohibited, even if you say you are using the Government imposed exchange rate (which is legal), persecution &amp; hate against “Capitalist  saboteur business owners” still exists, so companies only accept payments in other currencies from people they know and trust and not publicly/openly.

You don’t seem to know what a multisig is. A multisig wallet is like an address (or addresses as they are derived from a seed) which has not only one private key, but two, three, four... So it has cosigners, people/devices who need to sign with you the transaction in order to be able to spend from those addresses.
So, you shouldn’t be using a multisig wallet unless you are setting up a wallet which needs multiple signatures to spend from it, either because you and other people manage the funds in those addresses as cosigners (like treasurers of a club/association) or because you have different devices that you want to use as second verification method.
So, when you select 2of3, or 2of2... multisig wallet, you need to share something between your newly created multisig wallet and the other person or other persons, so they can setup the other key/keys on their devices.

Yes, Venezuela as of last Thursday was still very cheap for anyone making USD as income. But the economy is being dollarize even if people/the Gov don’t want to:
Two months ago a cup of coffee was worth ~$0.33 USD, less than a month ago it was already at ~$0.73 USD. So the price of a cup of coffee might be closer everyday to the price of it in any other South American country in terms of USD:
Also, take into account that we are buying huge bags of pasta and tens of kg of meat, we are being given special low prices in some cases (pasta, for example) because some suppliers wants to help those in need. Buying this amount of food in a supermarket (if you manage to find that much and you are allowed to get that much with you) would cost probably 3x or 4x that USD value
@_date: 2018-08-19 15:22:52
~$90-$100 USD
We usually buy 3-4 times the amount of food needed per day and store it (or weekly). This let’s us buy before prices rise, as we’d need more money (even in terms of USD) every day to buy almost the same.
UPDATE on 2018/08/28, regarding [the increase of the cost of products in terms of USD](
The soup kitchen where ~1700 eat daily needs 840kg of pasta weekly, on August 28th the price of it was 8,736.00 VES (~$102.21 USD) only in pasta. For the meals of the week they still need **meat (the most expensive part of the meal)**, vegetables, recipients, soap to wash the dishes, and other expenses (e.g. transportation).
So we passed from the quoted ~$100 USD above a week ago to make meals for 2000 people, to ~$102.21 USD only for the non-cooked pasta for 1700 people within the same soup kitchen, so the other 150 boys-kids orphanage, ~50 old men elderly center, ~50 girls orphanage, plus the people in the streets, are not even counted in those 840kg of pasta per week.
EDIT on 2018/09/01 -&gt; 
‪Just in case it helps understanding the cost of everything in terms of USD:‬
‪1kg of cheap meat ~ $0.81-$1.00 USD (August 31st 2018)‬
‪1800 VES newest minimum wage set by the Government, which they claimed it was $30 USD with a rate of 60 VES per USD at the time of announcement, is not being paid to anyone yet and it’s already at $18.27 USD at real market rate.
‪Someone making 400 VES/month (which is eight times the minimum wage today), received the biweekly payment yesterday for 200 VES ~ $2.03 USD at a real market rate of 98.52 VES per USD.‬
‪So, a family of four members, for example parents and two children, yesterday got their salary of $2.03 * 2 = $4.06 for the first fifteen days of September. 1 kg of regular meat ~$0.81 USD.‬
‪The family of four members could afford 5kg of the cheapest meat they could find for the whole next 15 days. Without taking into account, house expenses, vegetables, pasta, rice, water, car, gas, utilities, school, internet...‬

I fight Socialism in Spain, because Socialism doesn’t work and it kills people, also because it is being implemented in Spain by Communists funded by those who have taken Venezuela to its current situation.
I pay myself 40% or more in taxes everyday for everyday Euro I earn as a contractor/freelance (Autónomo), plus the 21% we all pay in VAT. Socialism sucks and those in power obviously prefer it as it lets them steal more and more when everyone’s money must go through them (the Government).
More pro free markets (at least in companies and job regulations) countries like Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, are capable of having (in my opinion too big) social programs, but only because they embrace trade and less Gov regulations in contracts, salaries... Even Norway will be able to have the Socialist dream of a UBI but only because every Norwegian privately owns a share of the oil in the country, not because of Socialism.

How is it safer to have Bitalo take care of half of the privkey and me with the other half, if any of us disappear from the earth the coins would be stuck in limbo. If there's no way to get the coins back this is ridiculous.
Check out Electrum seed, and find out a way to get only 1 multisig address, with the user carrying half the list of words (it could be longer in the new 2.0 version, soon) and the company carrying the other half.
Then you would have a receiving address with 2of3, with only 2 known privkeys (user's and company's), but you still will be able to restore the third privkey with the other half of the seed that could be given to a trusted third party or kept in custody, so any of the two parts could get to it if the other disappears.

The Petro is just a good looking Bolivar. It is debt issued by the same Government which has had to re-denominate the Bolivar twice in less than 10 years, to try to keep up with the inflation they feed themselves. 
The Gov can print as many Petros as they want, just like they do with the Bolivar. It looks like it was an attempt to make a new Sucre (Governments level currency used in some countries from the same team for imports/exports) but for global transfers with other countries, which by now have refused to use PTR as it has no value and it cannot even be "backed" by the trust those other countries might still have in the Venezuelan Government.
If the Gov was actually going to pay salaries with PTR why did they launch a new Bolivar (VES)? IMO they have decided go with the two shitcoins as that would let them print in those two ledgers (PTR and VES) at the same time.
Someone has just shared with me a screenshot of [this page]( showing the Petro logo, when I looked up the URL it was already updated with the Petro PTR added to the scams sections with some explanations:

**P2P Mining Hosting in Venezuela**
Hosting for ASIC hardware in Venezuela with an electricity cost of less than 0.005 USD / kWh, it is the best incentive for people to mine in P2Pool thus help to decentralize Bitcoin mining. 
To incentive mining in P2Pool
After all the flood of GHash.io omnipresence posts and the lack of incentives to run in P2Pool there is still need for a way to turn hashing power to this decentralized mining approach. 
Thinking on a way to make venezuelan users add value to Bitcoin, so they can be part of the movement, we think that mining would be the best practice as the Electricity prices in Venezuela are really low, but, first mining rigs and now ASICs, need to be bought with USD and imported, as both the equipment and the USD are scarce in the country due the to capital control it would not be possible for VEF (Bolivars) only owners to buy ASICs.
Venezuela has one of the lowest Electricity prices
Buying used-ASICs that are not profitable anymore in their current home countries and hosting them in Venenzuela would cope the less hashing power they have with a cheaper electricity, and making all of them run only in P2Pool would add real value to the Bitcoin network. 
Investors will be granted shares of the total 10000 (0.03 BTC each), and will receive the benefits generated by the acquired ASICs that will be sent to and hosted in Venezuela. ASIC owners can also have their hardware hosted in our locations in Venezuela and benefit from one of the cheapest electricity prices of the continent.
**Invest in Black Swan Project**
Investing in Black Swan Project will give you shares of the total 10000 (0.03 BTC each) of the acquired ASICs that will be sent to and hosted in Venezuela. The investor must buy shares using a Bitcoin address that he controls (NOT using hosted wallet addresses like Coinbase's or Bitstamp's) as it will be used to forward the payments according to the amount of shares acquired with that address.

The rich of yesterdays are fucked up, exiled or bankrupt due to what the government have made to them. Middle class has disappeared, now everyone is poor with less purchasing power, they can't even afford buying anything unless the gov help them, but they won't help anyone who is against them, more than 50% of the population is against them, the other half are poor people that loves making lines in supermarkets to get 1 milk powder can to feed their 6 sons.
Destroyed middle-class is still trying to be free, they spend they salaries in the black market at risk and loss buying anything that could help them buy things from other countries or as a store of value (like buying USD/EUR in the black market, PayPal balance, PokerStar's tokens, Netteller funds, Amazon giftcards...).

The idea is to make it P2P at the user level, spread all over the country. Taking care of a huge mining farm in a same place would need a lot of money in security, refrigeration and payments to the authorities / gangs to avoid being jailed or killed.
EDIT: Having hundreds of individuals running ASICs at no cost in P2Pool would be better for Bitcoin than making just another GHash.io or that Cointerras plant
EDIT2: That doesn't seem to be that "big" BTW, you could easily setup something 10x that size in Venezuela at a real low cost if you are friend or nephew of the president or any of his close friends...

There are hundreds or more of different USDVEF rates, everyone use the one that benefits them more. 
The same with BTCVEF, but as LocalBitcoins is the exchange with more BTCVEF volume, we use it at BitcoinVenezuela.com to calculate a “Buy Price” (a Market Order BUY, using LocalBitcoins’ ASKs in their orderbook). Others also use it for the street price calculations, so looking at LocalBitcoins and those of us using it is the easiest way to know the real market BTCVEF rate.
But USDVEF websites are not transparent, not like our BTCVEF-&gt;USDVEF that you can even host the code yourself and see the same result as us.
So, even if we put it in the blockchain not many people would agree to use that rate (yet. Working on that here

Only 400 USD per year for credit cards and electronic purchases.
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:27:44


I'm not sure I understand this phrase. If two months ago (June) you needed 1/3 of a Dollar $0.33 USD worth of Bolivars ~1,000,000.00 VEF to buy one cup of coffee, one month later (July) that one cup of coffee cost the double in Dollars ~$0.73 USD but you need three times the amount of Bolivars ~2,794,100.00 VEF; this means that the purchasing power of the Bolivar decreases more than the actual cost of producing the item (in Dollars) increases.
It is more costly to make a cup of coffee in Dollars due to scarcity and added prime due to be getting paid in hyperinflated Bolivars, but Bolivars are losing value at a higher rate than the costs in Dollars are increasing.
It is the cost in Dollars of products the one that is getting closers to those in order South American countries, it used to be cheaper, now is dollarizing itself because everything is imported, so it's cost is denominated in Dollars, despite the medium of exchange is the Bolivar.
People get paid, twice per month, in Bolivars. You can buy almost the same goods/products in some of the closer countries because the cost is being denominated in Dollars, so if a cup of coffee in July cost e.g. $0.80 USD in Colombia, it might have been very close to the same cup of coffee cost of $0.73 USD in Venezuela that same month, but it used to be cheaper (half) in Venezuela a month before that (June). It is indeed the scarcity and difficulty of finding the products and also having so pay them with Dollars that also have a prime added to them, what is increasing the productions costs, and also the price of the product (in Dollars). The base price used to be lower than other Latam countries.
Regarding the "pegged to 0.50 PTR" , 1,800.00 VES minimum wage they claimed it was $30.00 USD at time of announcement @ 6,000,000.00 VEF per USD (or 60.00 VES per USD). The lowest USDVEF rate in the real market is already above te 9,000,000.00 VEF per USD (or 90.00 VES per USD), so just a couple hours later the minimum wage was already only worth $19.65 USD and only if there is actually someone willing to buy you the 1,800.00 VES for $19.65 USD.
Same mistaken assumption was made here and I replied:  and here more:

Bs.F = Bolívares Fuertes
It used to be Bolívares (VEB Venezuelan Bolivars), but there was a hight devaluation and three zeros were taken out of the currency, then 1000 Bolívares were turned to 1 Bolívar. They changed the name to "Strong Bolivars" = "Bolívares Fuertes" (VEF Venezuelan Bolivar Fuerte). Ironically it was turned into a weaker currency, not stronger.
With 57% inflation and no control in money printing (Central Bank is sold to the political party in the government since 1999), and last March 24 with 723% devaluation (8,937% since 1999); Venezuela is only still breathing thanks to oil that represents 97% of the total exportation of the country.
It would be crazy to take another three zeros out of the currency, but seeing how prices are rising it could be though to be needed.

Electrum's seed is better to keep lots of addresses/privkeys printed on paper. You can also keep track of your balance using the MPK (Master Public Key) in an online computer. You can even learn the words and burn the paper down.
You will always be able to run Electrum and even export the privkeys if there are no more Electrum servers working in the future. Or manually create the transaction and broadcast them elsewhere.

Using a service for 2FA (ala Electrum's 2FA or GreenAddress.it) to make it like a 'forced green-address' that can't double spend might help to avoid this. And still you are not completely relaying your private keys in the service as it used to be with Gox's green-addresses.

Bitcoin has received a lot of bad coverage, but they also talk a lot about the great things bitcoin brings to the world.
In the case of Venezuela, it looks like everyone talks about the good things but ignore the awful things that happen there, and that is because oil can buy lots of good words.

There are LocalBitcoins, SurBitcoin.com, individuals. The real problem is that the bitcoin offer there is inexistent, and mining is only possible if you have access to a lot of investment and "friends" within the government itself.
People are mostly technically underdeveloped, lack of good internet connections, electricity cuts, lack of experience or professionals that can work for people abroad and earn bitcoins that they could later trade for the local currency depending on their needs, so incrementing the offer within the country.

I also see it that way, with a country divided how could you be helping the right people and not the bad ones? But there is also proof of what is really happening in a country despite only watching the news and all the conspiracy theories. There's people suffering the decisions made by their rulers.
Ukraine is divided by pro-Russia and Ukranians, but Venezuela is divided in two parts: Venezuelans and Venezuelans. One part pro-Government-Chávez-Cuba, the other part anti-Government, but it is not really pro-anyone, it just want to be free to live in their own country without the Government fucking around the entire economy while ignoring homicides (+25000 homicides in 2013).
No one seems to give a shit about Venezuela except those that wants his oil (the biggest amount of oil in the world).
Those that doesn't care much about Venezuelans because of the political parties and foreign interest are not humans, people in the streets don't see a dime of the (now dying) oil industry.

Thank you very much to all of you for your support!
People are currently dealing with Bitcoins and VEF, as they do with other ways of getting the money out of the country (like buying USD/EUR in the black market, PayPal balance, PokerStar's tokens, Netteller funds, Amazon giftcards...), anything that is not VEF is well worth for them. Some people needs VEF though, so that's the reason a real market will rise.
But They are currently doing that the bad way. Giving bank account numbers, real names to strangers and forget completely about buying Bitcoins in cash in a café. No one would ever meet with an stranger to exchange cash&lt;-&gt;BTC that is like going out of your house with a dartboard in your back.

The idea of this Bitcoinstarter campaign is to offer ad spaces in [Bitcoin Venezuela]( website for your donations to the cause.
I'm thinking on paying the needed bitcoins I can afford in advance to help people in Venezuela, so they won't have to wait until the campaign is finished and payments are collected by Bitcoinstarter.
You can also help spreading the word making retweet of this [tweet of the Bitcoinstarter campaign]( or this other [tweet that points directly to the address]( and the website.

I'm the admin of [Bitcoin Venezuela]( and we are building a service for (unregulated) remittances offices that are spread all over Europe, which serve users that send money to relatives in Venezuela. Those offices currently work manually without any software so they can only handle a few orders per day. Our project will let them offer a better service that will use bitcoin or a custom crypto to track orders and make them more reliable.
We already have the porject's code and we were looking at VPS prices to start operating with a pair of officies that knows about what we are doing.

[Bitcoin Venezuela]( is not a NGO, but we are working hard to setup a Venezuelan Bitcoin Foundation, we also have spread the word around the country, the website has received +25k unique visitors from Venezuela.
I've met with some well known bitcoin devs and users, I've managed to get a valuable team for Bitcoin Venezuela, and we are running a donation campaign to fund informative actions (flyers, DVDs, word spreading), food, help wounded people in hospitals that don't have medicines, in Venezuela

Who knows? Right now the gov should have activated everyones's access to USD already and they haven't. Also if you receive your retirement payroll in USD Venezuela's gov will pay you when they want and when it is more profitable for them.
Venezuela is not the ordenary country where everything is kinda OK and you expect the laws and rules to be followed, not even by those in the power.
You could be walking down the street and someone pass next to you in a motorcycle and shoot you in the head because he wanted to test the new gun they've stolen from a policeman dead body.

May I politely ask how would you avoid the Gov's forces and milicias knocking at your door for being dealing in Bitcoins? You could be shutdown, jailed or killed for those plans.
I've been promoting Bitcoin in Venezuela for almost 2 years now and I can say that it is easier to say than to get it done.
There's way though, a Decentralized Exchange for BTC&lt;-&gt;VEF so people will start trading the coins the already have, those that can import them will sell them too. A real economy based in that DEx might arise and that way you can fight Gov's oppression and controls.
Any other way different than that has already been discarded by many incredible minds from many places and the Bitcoin community, venezuelans, entrepreneurs, everyone I've been able to talk with, even myself.

Yes, Bitcoin and Litecoin... And I'm also learning a lot about Mastercoin if you have some it might help venezuelans if you don't believe in MSC anymore and want to throw them away.
Litecoin (and scrypts alts) are the only crypto-coins that can be mined in Venezuela, they are cheaper (fees are lower in USD too) so it would be logic for venezuelans to use Litecoin too. But those mining are currently middle-mining and getting bitcoins for their hash power anyway.
There are no ASICs or even importations in Venezuela sir, so it is useful for us to have alternatives that are even getting better (Litecoin) with active developments and a strong devoted community.

I'm in possession of the private key that manages that donations. In [Bitcoin Venezuela]( I have managed to get a valuable team, they are taking care of the needed actions in place to get Bolivars to those in need, we have contacts with students organizations, as you can see the first donation was to fund informative actions carried out by students.
[$6,725CAD were collected from the Bitcoin Community for Philippines Typhoon Haiyan]( I guess there are lots of examples...
[Sean Outpost]( receives thousands of donations to help homeless people.


About this part, check [my other comment]( in this same page.
[Bitcoin Venezuela]( is on the way to create the Venezuelan Bitcoin Foundation, but as you might know this is kinda difficult due to the legal situation in the country as we could be shut down in minutes for teaching how to avoid money control...
Mining rigs (for Litecoin or middle-mining) needs to be bought and imported from other countries, it even has to be imported from Europe as in America stores have run out of them.
For the last part, you'd need to read every single comment I've made in the Bitcoin Communities, attended to one of my talks or stay one hour talking with me without going nuts :)

Venezuelans, North Koreans, most people in Africa; Bitcoin is more important for the other 6 billion people in the world. You don't see freedom as something really needed because probably you don't suffer of lack if it.
Amir, like any other enthusiastic has his way to tell stories. Most of the 1 billion won't like it, the rest of the world will listen, but until Dark Wallet or Dark Market are up and running it's only words...

Well, dealing in Bitcoins is illegal (still have to read the latest law from 19 February 2014), so I’m trying to introduce Bitcoin to people in Venezuela, then everyone is free to join the Bitcoin economy or not (with or without [Bitcoin Venezuela]( help), they already deal in many other (more insecure) ways that are also illegal (black market).

You better don't make many "in person" trades in Venezuela if you feel your life is important to you. This is why people mostly use bank transfers, despite the fact they can be tracked by the government, it is safer to use this rather than meeting in person with others to buy/sell USD or BTC.

I didn't know Iceland was in (almost) the same situation as Venezuela. This is not going to work anyway. I think the creator just wants his own pump&amp;amp;dump, this has been discussed many times in the forums; there is a discussion about a local crypto-coin for Venezuelans and it will always end up as a bad idea.
Besides that, having a team or a guy thinking this is going to work doesn't make it a better idea. In both countries they already have their shitty local coins (ISK / VEF) why would they want a shitty alt-coin that will only has value within the country. Wasn't the problem that citizens can't invest abroad?
What a joke, people like laughing about these situations.

One cannot setup a warehouse to host an entire datacenter for mining in Venezuela, you'll be raided and jailed by the government in no time. There is a money control law that doesn't let anyone trade foreign currencies or any kind of asset (that could be traded to a foreign currency) freely. Even if it is written in the law that you are able to do it, you'll probably be stopped as it is in the interest of the gov and its friends to not let you be free.

There are like 10 professional miners with mining farms in Venezuela that I know about. Two of them are members of [Bitcoin Venezuela]( our main project.
ASICs will be located in a distributed way in several different places in Venezuela to avoid concentrating all of them in one place, which will make it really hard to be shut down if the Gov would want to.
A technical paper will be released soon with modifications added to the ASICs to make them plug-and-play, so it is easier for our hosts.

Never, ever enter your seed anywhere but in your Electrum wallet.

You should not have lots of bitcoins on any web-wallet or wallet where you are not in possession of the private keys.

This is what the Venezuela's Government and supporters thinks about this quote
The Minister of Education, Héctor Rodríguez said in this [video]( yesterday: "we will progressively be getting out the most poorest people from that bad situation, and this has to come together with a lot of politic organizations, discussions; **we won't get them out of poverty, to bring them to the middle class so they can dream of being 'escuálidos'** (laughs)"
Escuálido: derogatory way of referring to the Venezuelan opposition
 &lt;- the comic says:
· Why don't you teach me to fish?
· For you to turn to a 'escuálido? Forget it...'
The government obviously needs to keep the population poor and stupid so they can [spend all the country's money on expensive things]( and leave them all with [2 pieces of food per day](

To help to introduce Bitcoin in Venezuela basically the only thing we can do is educate, spread the word, and let people decide. This has to be this way as if you are able to setup any kind of service like an exchange you'll probably end up raided and put in jail the next day.
It is illegal to trade any kind of foreign currency or asset that can be exchanged for foreign currencies.
So let's teach people how to use Bitcoin and other tools for anonymity and they will create their own path to liberty.
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:15:04
Venezuelan professionals can sell their services or digital products over the internet getting paid in Bitcoins. They currently can't do that as foreigners can't pay them trough the ordinary ways we have in other countries, like PayPal, wire transfer, payza... Then they can trade the Bitcoins inside the country for VEF or buy things from other countries, something that they cannot do right now either as the only currency they have worth almost nothing; there are money control that doesn't let them freely buy things on Amazon, App Stores, or anywhere USD (foreign currencies) are needed.
Bitcoin will give them a bit of breath letting them buy things they need that doesn't even exist in the country.
Graphics cards for mining, having almost the lowest costs in electricity in the world doesn't help them to mine as there are no computer pieces in the country as those need to be imported using USD by companies that doesn't have any!

Because Bitcoin transactions are not free in most of the cases, you have to include a fee to be sure that the tx is include in the following blocks. If not you can end up with the tx stuck in limbo and being dropped, so you'll need to re-broadcast it with a higher fee; something you can not do as you don't have access to the private key or to the raw tx.

Yes, he is all Dollarization. At the current situation in Venezuela that’s the best approach, if it ever gets adopted by the people themselves, of course, politicians won’t ever implement that as they need the printing machine to govern.
Thing is with Dollarization of Venezuela that, not everyone can have a USD bank account, and cash is not the best for long-distance payments, this is where Bitcoin and (yeah, I know) other cryptocurrencies, including all the private money issuers: TrueUSD, TetherUSD, USDC, Dai... come to play in that situation. 
Bitcoin is king, and it is borderless, so even if Venezuela ever (please!) gets to Dollarization, people will be able to also learn about Bitcoin.

There are more and more regular people using Bitcoin for to turn their extra funds/income to USD (cash or PayPal/Neteller/Bank of America...) or keep it in BTC.
Then they convert to Bolivars (VES) through LocalBitcoins and Facebook/Telegram groups when they need to spend VES.
The huge increase in volume may be more related to Goverment officials and other wealthy people, though, rather than a real adoption from the bottom.

100% of the donations go to food and medicines. Bitcoin Venezuela's humanitarian aid project  helps feed over 1600 people daily, last year we gave away over 550,000 meals.
Thanks for suggesting our foundation. If we could get funds for transparency, hire people, document everything, etc; we would totally do it, but if we are only receiving enough to buy food and taking into account that every week prices double in the country in USD terms, we prefer to spend all funds in food for the time being.

Hello , I'm the admin of BitcoinVenezuela.com and I've been running the page with some help since November 2012 as a non-profit organization. We spread the word about Bitcoin and help new users to learn the basics. We've made campaigns like [this one]( , and helped in talks in some universities throughout these years.
We have a Facebook group which has ~7000 members, thousands of them are actively participating in the Bitcoin community, mining, or trading. 
Currently there are a few (new) Libertarian groups that have started sharing Bitcoin in social media with all their contacts, they've taken Bitcoin signs to last months demonstrations, and now they are speaking at universities and to other people even in meetups organized in poor neighborhoods, just to make them see that there is alternative to the Bolívar (VEF).
What do you suggest taking into account the difficulty for most people there to even have a surplus on their current income that they could put into Bitcoin without risking their, already difficult to fulfill, basic needs?

I think the _$1200/day mining profits_ quoted in the article is for a PHs mining operation which gets redistributed between investors.
Something like  
If you think _"Alberto"_ is referring to a single person, a kid, and also think that that same person is the average very low income Venezuelan who was promised a Socialist paradise and ended up eating garbage in the streets _"break into zoos to eat horses to survive"_; first, you didn't understand the different people the article is referring to and the vast Venezuela population, second you are too stupid. 


Stealing is what the Government does everyday and the Venezuelan Gov has done for 18 years. A huge part of the profits some of these guys running these mining operations are making are being spent in the country. Exporting hashpower produced in Venezuela at a lower cost and importing hard currency to import food or spend in the country. They may be making the dictatorship implosion to happen later than sooner, but they are feeding people and making their lives better (despite Socialism) at the same time.

Well, you can look for Randy Brito and 'Bitcoin Venezuela' (BitcoinVenezuela.com) on google to see what comes up.
Not sure about the utility of Xapo like cards of using them in Venezuela (if they are denominated in USD), but yes, there are Debit Cards that can be funded with Bitcoin to spend in Bolivars (VEF) to acquire food at any price (which would be like importing them but easier, importing things is risky).
These networks are very active, they just lack any kind of funds for action, so they usually do things that don't cost them money, like talks, handing out flyers to teach the basics of economics...
If you are interested you can send a message to contacto (you can use PGP that you can find here: keybase.io/rdymac if you prefer), and let's get in touch with the organizers of the groups to create a channel of communication for faster decisions making on what can be done and do it quickly if needed.

What you are describing is iOS not being able to let you select what app you want to use to open the URI Bitcoin payment link.
On Android you can select any of the Bitcoin wallet apps that you have installed right after clicking the URI link (if you haven't set the "open always with this one" option yet), but on iOS there isn't any option, the URI handler in the entire OS opens a random wallet of any of the ones you have (there is some kind of hierarchy between the wallets' URI handling), it usually doesn't matter what browser you use because it defaults to one wallet.

If the Point of Sale shares the payment order through NFC, any mobile Bitcoin wallet which uses NFC can grab the info (just like scanning a QR code) and make the payment.
If the Bitcoin wallet is offline for safety and only signs a payment order (as it was discussed once at Electrum's IRC channel) the Point of Sale would only need to also be able to receive the signed tx through NFC and broadcast it.
We discussed this ^ in the possibility of the tx being dropped by the Bitcoin network and need it to be re-broadcast, in this case the merchant would be able to do it himself instead of having to trust the payer to do it from his phone several hours or days later.

0.1 BTC is enough for one single person with basic needs covered. 
A family of five members can live with 0.5 BTC at current exchange rate, which is ~ 2,008,000.00 VEF/BTC.
None of the above are able to have anything for savings, and might find it difficult sometimes if there is even more scarcity and some needs are covered but more expensive.
You can check the current average price in VEF I used at BitcoinVenezuela.com, btcReport (iOS) and BitcoinChecker (Android), both apps use Bitcoin Venezuela (btcven) API for the BTC/VEF price.

I guess people that knows Bitcoin can receive them, but they would still need to exchange it to Bolivars to buy food/things inside the country. Maybe those that provide these things in the Facebook group can accept the Bitcoin directly and deliver to those buyers (who received the 0.1 BTC) for them to distribute the food around them instead of going out with Bolivars to buy the things.
There was a Tweeter share yesterday run by libertarian groups asking people to use USD and EUR bill notes instead of Bolivars (VEF) for everything they can, and also Bitcoin when possible, to try to stop the need of the Bolivar bills in the economy. I think this is something that can also help, get small bills that are already in Venezuela and try to get people to pay each other with $1 bills every time possible for cash transactions and use Bitcoin for those transactions that are usually made through bank transfers but denominate them in VEF even if the actual transaction is in BTC as rail (this last thing is something I'm working myself with a Bitcoin wallet developer).

You think it can’t be used as every day currency, but it is being used as such already in poor countries. As I said before, when Bitcoin is the only payment method you have at hand, you use it despite its inconveniences, not for coffee obviously, there is no coffee in Venezuela's supermarkets, or you do use it for coffee but not just a cup but a couple kilos from other sellers, so you pay ~$0.30-$0.70 USD worth of Bitcoin in transaction fees and get to buy the coffee that not many other has just because you have Bitcoin to buy it.

Well, that's some kind of adoption. The case mentioned/linked is maybe not the best as Traki is known to be run by chavistas, so the thing is if the other ~3500 (and reducing) merchants, stores, companies in the country could freely accept other cryptocurrencies (if they learn and want to). Not sure about that.

People doing humanitarian aid are usually targeted by police and military police groups who usually try to confiscate things for themselves.
The stores accepting any other currency than the Bolivar could be targeted by the Government if they don't use the Government mandated exchange rates.
@_date: 2019-01-13 19:14:43


“Private banks” still exist in Venezuela, because the current implemented local currency runs on top of it. All of them are controlled by the Government through strict regulations and/or direct intervention.
When they’ve implemented a different payment method, medium of exchange, the Government most probably won’t need the local private banks anymore.


The problem are not privately owned banks, the real problem are public banks and central banks. A private bank with a shitty currency (e.g. Bitfinex's USDT) doesn’t represent any danger to anyone who’s not a direct client of that bank and who is not using their shitty coin. On the other hand, a public bank and/or central banks affect all the people's lives in a country by relying on the State's power to force everyone to to use their shitty coin (e.g. Bolivars, Dollars...) and being bailout when they mess up.
@_date: 2019-04-29 16:45:56
there aren’t many cards in Venezuela, local cards also have very low limits in VES, POS devices usually don’t work, cards in foreign currency are scarce and some have blocks to operate in Venezuela, oh, and there are electricity cuts that last days. In those cases paying using crypto by phone is a last resort.

I think you cannot re-fill it as of today yet, but couldn’t you open a new channel to the same peer with more capacity and use both?
Thing is that if the other peers doesn’t put money themselves in a channel to you, you are not able to receive anything until you’ve paid for something through the channel you’ve funded.
So receiving (beyond the difficulty of always being on alert for bad actors) is very limited at current state of the implementation.
I’ll try Shango if it is on mainnet as it has a (temporary) dedicated node which others could connect to and fund channels to, which would let it have receiving capacity, something I’m seeing very limited in BLW right now.

Hashes are not data?

I’m spending on some things with BLW to test, and sending to other services which would let me withdraw on-chain from there, but receiving capacity is still pretty low ~90k sat. Why sending through the channels I setup with a few nodes is not increasing my receiving capacity?
Or am I confused? ��

People already do it, young people are helping their 4-5 members families by earning ~$2 USD/day clicking and completing captchas.
Unfortunately most of that people need to exchange that money to VEF as it is still persecuted to use USD openly at free market rate (it is illegal to use an exchange rate different than the one imposed by the Government).
Even if people would like to pay others in BTC or USD directly there isn't any easy to use wallet for regular people, people who don't understand much about computers and apps, these people need a Send and Receive dead simple UI; so accepting payments in a different currency (not the VEF) can be done by anyone with a cheap Android.

Our API uses public data from the only current exchange with enough volume in VEF, LocalBitcoins. You can make the calculations yourself and see that the price we show is market base, something you cannot do with those sites.
Bitcoin Venezuela's API is currently integrated into [Bitcoin Checker]( (Android), [btcReport]( (iOS), [Electrum]( and [Electrum-LTC]( (all platforms), [Págame Con Bitcoin]( (Android, Windows, Windows Phone), [OpenNode.co]( (web)...

Hello , I run BitcoinVenezuela.com 
I've been obsessed about how to help Venezuela with Bitcoin since early 2012. I've looked into all posibilities during all these years and I have run several ideas through many people, Bitcoin/crypto devs and communities. There are a few little apps/techs that could actually solve a few problems there, they are not developed because almost no one puts time, coding, money... towards them. People seem to usually be more attracted to reinventing the wheel.

“Unknown Bitcoin address from Paxful”? Sounds like you need to add the address to some kind of whitelist for withdrawing from your Paxful account. It might need 2FA confirmation, which could be the reason why it doesn’t let you withdraw right away. Go to Settings and look for Withdrawals or something like that.

Just acquired the hardware to make the demo of the mesh (I currently could only afford one big node and two small nodes):
The big node will have a Bitcoin full node synchronizing with the network using the Blockstream satellite, and on top of it will have a Lightning Network node. The idea of achieving this is that the two small nodes should be able to use LN payments between them and if any of the two goes offline from the mesh, the other won’t be able to broadcast a previous state without the big node noticing it as it is downloading the Bitcoin blockchain from the satellite, so it can use Watchtower to try to protect the off-line mesh node. Big nodes are also meant to be gateways to the internet, but the satellite connection is needed in case it also disconnects from the internet due to power cuts or if there is no service (which is pretty common now in Venezuela).
I can issue a LN invoice for any amount you would like to donate, but it is not from our own LN node yet as we are still setting up all the stuff for the mesh nodes first demo.

You only need to keep your seed (twelve-word-pass-phrase) in a safe place and you'll be able to recover all your private keys.
You can also keep copies of your wallet file (electrum.dat) if you have imported keys, like vanity addresses. There is also a plugin to keep an online backup of the labels you've set for transactions so you are safe in many ways.

The latests versions are always more secure than previous ones. If you are using an Electrum 1.7.1 version, you may be exposed to more important bugs than running the latest 1.8.1, that may have minor bugs like UI or buttons not working.
It is always better to run the most secure version than keeping and old one because "you don't want to lose a beauty feature" for example.

Translation: These are the first three places accepting Bitcoin to eat and drink in Spain.
The first is well known by the bitcoin users in Spain, it is called Do Eat, and it's all about low food and DIY (Do It Yourself). The second started accepting Bitcoin a week or two ago, they serve seafood and is located in Barcelona. The third is located in Madrid as Do Eat and is a pub to drink and spend the time with good music.
