I hope you are doing well. But if you are not, you should know that what you are going through right now is character building, you may feel bad right now but one day you'll look back on this as an important lesson. You will definitely do better next time there is a bull run, and more importantly, if you can handle massive losses and the negativity that comes with that - you will be able to handle a lot of the shit that life throws at you in the future. Hopefully this brings a bit of light into your world as you realize that you will come out of this moment as a stronger human than you were prior.

**June 13**
The US Securities and Exchange Commission are holding the SEC investor Conference in Atlanta, where attendants will meet with members for a more informal discussion on issues regarding regulation in the crypto-currency field, mutual funds and fraud prevention.
Official SEC website advertises the event as follows:
*Meet the people who help make Wall Street work for Main Street. All five SEC Commissioners are coming to Atlanta to meet with you: young people, the military, urban and rural, those saving for retirement, and seniors—the diverse, the dynamic people of the southeast region.*
Some members of the community have been recently concerned that SEC might classify crypto-currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as securities. 
The security classification would have a devastating effect on the market due to tax regulation and legal ownership of crypto assets.
However, SEC Officials calmed the spirits by saying it was ICO Tokens they are looking at, not Bitcoin. 
The main topic of discussions will be around the processes involved in ICO investments and how to classify them.
