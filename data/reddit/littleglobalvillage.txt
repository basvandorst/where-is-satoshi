Only if a lot of people adopt it. Steps like this will help in getting new people. We NEED to recruit!
Bitcoin foundation needs to think of innovative ways to get new people to get wallets and get their first bitcoins.
Like a non-profit burger place in every major city in the world that only accepts Bitcoins. Cheap burger for everyone if they have a bitcoin wallet.

What is their bitcoin address? can I see some transactions on Blockchain?
@_date: 2013-10-26 14:48:55
You should spend wherever possible and buy back the spent amount through some other source :)
@_date: 2013-10-22 13:12:27
yes. You shouldn't choose to pay with bitcoins if there is a chance that the business could do something wrong. Its perfectly fine if your business is just a simple business like a coffee shop. 
That said, there is place for third party services that give bitcoiners buyers protection for a fee, much like PayPal.

This could be quite moronic too:
Is it ok to keep my password protected wallet.dat file in dropbox?

You only get to watching the movies and TV shows when you understand some basic English.. How did you learn the basic English? Would you say others in China would aspire to learn English as well?

yes.. I think its about time we started using mBTC or milli bitcoins as the primary unit. When the value reaches $100000, we'll start using Satoshi I guess. 
Currently 1 mBTC ~= 20 cents. So mBTC seems appropriate right now.

Email took so long because it took so long for people to get their hands on computers. Neither were viral social networks that would spread information in a matter of days present 30 years ago. All the infrastructure needed for Bitcions to reach the masses is already there. Its just a matter of very little time until almost everyone with a computing device gets their hands on them.
Thank you for wasting my time!

I think the person was on Skype or something. Not really sure.
So it looks like they asked Sunny to get someone to shoot him while he was being asked questions by someone from Bitcoin Magazine over Skype!

Except that when an average Chinese person owns bitcoins, the number of Chinese people owning bitcoins will be far greater than the entire population of the US
