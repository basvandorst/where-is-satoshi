I have no idea why, but Canucks are way ahead of our overlords to the south in terms of banking. We started using the PIN/chip cards last year and we're already on to the next thing, "Flash".  [Royal Bank](
. I have this on my debit and credit cards. As a generalization, Canucks use debit and/or a combination of credit to pay for every store purchase. Who carries cash? We also have full access to our accounts from our smart phones and can transfer money to others by way of their email address or phone number. I can send someone money from my account to theirs via individual smart phone to smart phone access to our accounts, in a couple of minutes. It's all pretty slick. The next step hopefully will be to get rid of the cards and use the phones via whatever network the banks are using for the flash service.
Getting back to the OP, debit card purchases are slower than cash so stores with small transactions hated them and tried to deter people from using card by adding a service fee or not allowing cards for purchases less than $5. Flash is comparable in terms of speed to cash and so even our infamous Timmy's coffee shop will accept them without fees or limits. I have no idea about the fees the merchants pay, but it must be low as the adoption of Flash is spreading quickly.
Regarding Bitcoin - opening up smart phone apps and using QR codes is lame and slow. Look to the great white north as our banks seem to be ahead of the curve.
I'm not on the side of the banks; I love the idea of Bitcoin, but there are currently much more convenient options available to us Canucks. Other utility aside, hopefully BTC can be made easier to use for the average population.
