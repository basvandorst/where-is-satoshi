Max block size should be larger. They would not mind if actual block size chosen by miners would stay the same. It is the max block size that is seen as a issue not allowing market flow freely to decide what the actual block size should be. (I think)

I think [this]( describes the status nicely:


fault— in many places— for making it harder for implementers to get
things right.   MtGox is at fault for not implementing in a way that
copes with behaviors in the Bitcoin protocol which have been known
since at least 2011.
So basically bitcoin protocol is working, but is not perfect. There are things that could be done better. Now when Gox and other exchanges are having problems with some aspect of the protocol, developers will solve the issue on the protocol level. 
They would not need to do anything and the protocol would still work. They decided to change the behavior probably because it will help solve the problems for everybody on one place. Not fixing this issue would mean that all developers using transaction hash as id (myself included) would need to fix it on their parts.

Basically if you would like to use some multisignature features you need public key for few things like create P2SH address for instance.
I am trying to build android application that allows two my devices to create multisigniture address but I do not want any of the devices to know about the private key until the signing process.
Having some paper wallets/keys seemed like an excellent idea, but I did not found any paper wallet providing public key.

TLDR: In Hard fork is dangerous to accept bitcoins if you do not have upgraded client. Your bitcoins are safe and you are safe with new client.
Forking has some potential for fraud for parties that do not know about it happening. Fork basically means that the history of transactions that is continuasly build into a blockchain at some point in time splits into two chains. This could happen from time to time even without changes in current software because of how the blockchain is spread around the globe. 
Normally this is solved with the rule of thumb - the longest chain is the valid chain. If you are a running a honest node, you will download both splitted chains and decide which one is valid by calculating the length.
Hard fork is special case of fork. At some point new client generates block into blockchain that old client does not understand. That will cause all old clients to think about the new block as invalid and they will not accept that block and any other block that comes after the invalid block. All together the old clienst that do not accept the new version work on their own forked version of blockchain. Usually when this happens there is majority of computing power is on the new version of software and the new fork grows faster.
So from old client perspective there is no fork happening, they just see some invalid nonsense on network that they igonre. From new client perspective there is fork happening. There is chain of blocks that contains new type of blocks and there is chain of blocks that does not contain it. 
Old clients do not accept new fork because it contains invalid blocks and new clients do not accept old fork, because it is shorter.
Now, usually all transactions would come to both chains eventually. Both sides would take new transactions and put them into their chains eventually. But as was mentioned, we are solving a scalability issue here. So potential attacker could wait for some of his transaction to get validated into new fork. And then he has some time to spend his transaction differently on an old fork. He would probably create new transaction with bigger transaction fee and convinced some of the old client to put his double spend transaction in the old fork. When the attacker now hase double spend bitcoins, he can now effectively spend his bitcoins in different way on both chains. 
If you would then accept such double spend bitcoins on old fork, you would not get this money in case you would upgrade your client to new fork.

@_date: 2015-08-15 22:45:42
I am not sure what exactly is pain in the ass... Usually you do not care because there is consensus around. You go throw the trouble when there is a benefit... 
When there will be trouble you want to have a pool of different implementations that you can quickly switch around...
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:20:44
Forks do not differ and differ, when it is clear which chain is longer the more flexible implementation switches to the longest chain. If my implementation is not the flexible I go and change it or not as I wrote before.

Ofc is my security model checking forums IRC and mailing list. That is one part of it I do not understand how else you would find out that someone else found an issue somewhere...
Are you asking me how to automate it? Is it really that difficult to send some queries to your favorite blockexplorer solutions to find out whether they agree with your implementation on what is the latest block?
If you are an implementation maintainer that cares a lot you would probably detect forks when you see other blocks on on network that you denied, you could raise an alert...

I guess you are sarcastic, because I agree. But in general I go to forums like this one to find out what is happening in the ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:09:37
I do not understand the reasoning - something is/is not Bitcoin. In my opinion Bitcoin is not 1 particular implementation. There should be preferably thousands of different implementations. Some of the implementations will not accept other implementation blocks but that does not matter, the majority will create longest chain and the left over implementaions will adapt (or will not if they do not want to be on board).
So I personally wellcome XT.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:33:18
I am not running all implementation and I can find out what is the length I do not understand how is that difficult...
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:13:33
So far the implementation called core runs on the longest chain, when it is no longer true there will be drawbacks.
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:28:01
Every implementation differs from each other - bugs are in the code and there is little you can do... 
That is also one of the reasons why you would like to have many implementations so that some bugs on one implementation do not take over the Bitcoin network and the others do not accept bugged block and build different chain. 
Bugged block cannot be differentiated from a different intentional rule.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:14:32
I just told you how to check...
@_date: 2015-08-22 01:22:28
When you do MN your output script says that related input has to have M of N signatures. 
When you do p2sh the output transaction has hash of unknown script.  The spending input has the script that hash itself into hash from p2sh output which usually will be MN and then second part with the signatures.
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:46:14
I disagree, every implementation gives the Bitcoin protocol its flavor. When as a maintainer of your implementation you find out that the longest chain is not accepted by your implementation you go and check why. Some of your code has different opinion on a particular block. 
When you find out what is the reason you have two choices:
* You accept the different rule and change your implementation
* You do not accept it and will hope that people will recognize why and join your side
Both approaches are very reasonable and will happen in future sooner or later. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:09:24
I disagree,
you always run one particular implementation. Maybe some implementation with relaxed rules maybe the one that is currently popular but it is one implementation.
As a user of bitcoin you probably do not care, all your transactions will get most probably accepted in all forks. The blocks would differ but your transaction has a fee so miner will include it on all sides. If you want to be perfectly sure, you just choose the implementation that runs the longest chain with rules you accept.
As a miner you want to miner you most probably want to mine fork that has the most value which usually is the one with most users. So you pick implementation that follows the longest chain.
If you see that your implementation does not accept longest chain you go to its website to understand why. If there is not a valid explanation you switch implementation otherwise you stay.
This seems to me to be simple enough.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:13:46
To address your example.
If my implementation accept the transaction and therefore accepts block with such transaction there will be a fork, but when the non accepting group will create longer chain my implementation will switch to that one. So as a user I would just need to wait for 6 confirmations.
As a miner I would be worried why my blocks do not get accepted and start not accepting such transactions until the problem gets resolved on a majority of miners.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:35:19
not length of an implementation but length of a longest chain.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:50:39
Well usually it is the same as on other implementations. That is during consensus times, when there is not a consensus time around, you can find block explorer solution running that implementation, check the implementation web or ask maintainers...

I guess guys upvoting this also upvoted you in this small war. I did.
@_date: 2012-10-04 08:12:24
As I understood it, there will never be a situation when "all bitcoins are mined" the reward for getting new blocks will go down and down, but never reaches zero. Its possible for instance, that 20 million bitcoins will get lost on addresses that noone has key from. This will leave in market much less bitcoins. People will start using much smaller proportion of bitcoins. 
I can see 2 extreme scenarios (with anything in between also possible):
1) in case very little amount of bitcoins will get lost, then the fee will be much bigger than today and maybe bigger than the actual reward from new blocks. 
2)In case a lot of bitcoins will get lost, then there is still reason to mine new blocks, even though the reward is much much much smaller. As the price of the bitcoins rise with the old bitcoins missing from market.
Also as i understand it, its irrelevant if bitcoins are lost, or just standing on address that is accessible, but no1 ever uses it (savings account).  Until that person uses the bitcoins, there is no way how to distinguish those two.
But of course, I am newbie and I can be wrong.
@_date: 2012-08-04 12:26:19
I don't understand the arguments 100% but It seams like if there would be "jewelery" like thing where your Bitcoins would be presented it would satisfy the search for value. 
Becouse if that's the only problem, well potentially I could make for instance Bitcoin stickers that automatically update amount of BTC from your wallet. You could put such stickers on your web page or under your comments. This seams to me enough "jewelery" like.

Hi. I read some of your comments and do not know if someone else explained the following. 
No decimal places are actually added anywhere. Every number already has infinite number of decimal places. It just happens that we use numbers in it that have  all decimals after some point set to zero. 
When people tell you that decimal places will be added they just mean that they will now allow to use more nonzero decimal places. 
Suppose Obama declared that from tomorrow all price tags will change by adding 1 decimal place. 
9.99 would become 9.990 but the value in dollars would remain the same. 
The process of adding places to price tags have no effect on value.

Hello Luke, thanks for writing this up. 
I am far from expert on BTC issues or in SW development. 
In my dev carrier I always try to use solutions that can be reversed in case I mess something that I didn't expect upfront. When I push updates into production I always think about how would I go about removing the functionality in future.
When I compare BU and SW for myself it seems to me that.
If we after one year find out that BU is really an issue, the reverting back to small blocks seems like another if statement to me.
But If we find out SW bringing unforseen negative consequences what is the contingency plan?

On the other hand Bitcoin really could be antifragile. In that case any action against/for it would make it stronger.
@_date: 2013-02-15 09:33:16
I would start with explaining difference between Ponzi sheme and bubble:
from wiki 
An economic bubble: A bubble is similar to a Ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant (until inevitable collapse). A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, or tulip bulbs) where prices rise because buyers bid more because prices are rising. Bubbles are often said to be based on the "greater fool" theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme, there is no single person misrepresenting the intrinsic value.
This is from my point of view crucial in understanding bitcoin. This is first step I take when explaining bitcoin. Becouse when person understand this difference, i can then focus on explaining the actual bitcoin value.
@_date: 2013-04-01 07:06:09
So if I understand correctly, he is saying he actually was not able to scam to much because there were other scamers (exchanges) around. So in case our lovely not so much ponzi scheme rise in usage it will be harder and harder to scam in this way. 
I would also like to point out, that there is very slight possibility that Bitcoin is anti-fragile. If that would be the case, we could be thankful this scamers for moving the price and therefore extending the Bitcoin overall value.
@_date: 2013-11-15 06:35:20

(this transaction could be signed even before the final contract is signed)

In theory you can still use it if you want. However majority of miners decided, that they will forget the profit that they generated and migrate to the other chain. I am going with them. You can think about this as a typical example of the 50% attack.
The reasons why they decided to move was that a lot of newbies do not use the 0.8 version and there is no reason to push them to upgrade now if that is not necessary. 
I cannot see how normal user would be affected by this, because if you did not plan to double spend you could send your transaction all the time and it would get processed regardless of the choice the miners did.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:42:55

I personally do not understand the point of "missing the boat". Because Bitcoin is divisible, you could think in mBTC and immediately it would seam that other currencies are better priced.

You can check the - Bitcoin Days Destroyed statistic. 
If you would now use bitcoin that was used 5 days ago, you will destroy 5 bitcoin days. if you use bitcoin that was used 1 day ago you will contribute with 1 Bitcoin day destroyed. If you use bitcoins that were last used 1 year ago, you will contribute with value 365. 
Also if you send bitcoin to another adress directly or if you would send the bitcoin indirectly throw 50 different intermediate adresses, it would still generate the same Bitcoin days destroyed (assuming it would take same time in total from the first address to the last).

12000000 / 55000 = 218 Bitcoins for each of us.

Maybe this is for him first small transaction in a longer series.

I think that greed will be the driving factor of Bitcoin. More on similar topic my old high-school friend Milton:

I do not understand Ripple yet. How can I join network based on trust if I do not know (and trust) anyone who ever joined it before me?

The Bitcoin mining bonus is designed as infinite sequence. Around the date that people are talking about will be the reward calculated from the sequence lower than 1 Satoshi.
So it is quite possible that in case the precision of Bitcoin would be extended, than the reward will be still granted to the miners. Even though it would be very small. 
Its also possible that the fork that will contain extending of precision will contain changes to the way reward is calculated so that the will ignore the extended precision on Bitcoin itself and therefore not grant any additional rewards to miners after some date.
Note also that even if the potential reward would not stop ever, that does not mean that we would exceed the 21-milion Bitcoins in total. 
Note also that better Bitcoin precision would be needed much earlier than in 2140 for the infinite rewarding to take place. It is because the reward is always halving.
TLDR: Everything is to be decided. Current version of protocol will stop rewarding around the time other people are telling you (around 2140).

Sent few bitcoins to my phone wallet; going for business trip abroad for 2 weeks and hoping i could try to exchange bitcoins for local currency.

I think that it depends on the time when you would ask. If gold goes down than more people would say no. If gold would rise you would see more people saying yes. (Just my opinion)

Actually you would also need a public key upfront from the escrow. So you need to contact them twice. Am I mistaken?

On the other hand, the money going into Bitcoin now could be from the same "source" as the one pumping stocks.

I do not understand ripple enough, but still I have a feeling that you missed the point of ripple. It seams to me that they are not trying to replace Bitcoin but on the contrary trying to work with it.
