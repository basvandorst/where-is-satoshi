Why spend good money like bitcoin when you could spend bad money like usd while people are still willingly to accept the fiat monopoly money.. i don't spend my gold for same reason.

Eos and Komodo has decentralized dexs. So does blocknet, etc. bitshare is a dex

Delusional is thinking the LEO where OP lives is able to broadly enforce this. How many LEO per capita?

Wait for the bailout when their security is breached. The bailout shitcoin that will follow is their end game serfdom token.

No mobile wallets with direct invoicing via public key qrcode display?

"government have you beaten up or worse" is a "legal" resolution. Again "legal" is subjectively applied by humans.
I guess protecting each other from violent criminals and their supports (leo and the state ) would be too simple a solution

So true, then a 'story' would told, the public would know it is bs, but they might accept it like they did with Kennedy.

"Legal" is subjectively enforced violence by the state criminals. If its a matter of survival for family friends i would look for a technical solution instead of waiting for a legal resolution. Commonsense against self destructive servile behavior.

Bitcoin or not, the system is broken across the country and this is just another 'pro tax' (violence) candidate.  Free state project candidate would be better.

Correct. But bitcoin has value and utility not just scarcity.

Komodo lightening network can be used for this when it is released shortly. Also atomic swaps so, bye-bye to being forced to used centralized exchanges.

Injustice system, just to clarify.

Wow, that old clique from fiat money printers.
@_date: 2018-07-03 23:45:38
They can and do. You seem to think scribbles on a piece of paper (aka US Constitution) are somehow magically enforced. Remove fiat and the vast majority of these parasites would be out of a job.
