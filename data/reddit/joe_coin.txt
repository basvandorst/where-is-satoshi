My one tip is to say it's extremely important to recognize valid vs. faulty comparisons of Bitcoin to the USD or gold or whatever else. For example, saying that Bitcoin can't do chargebacks (with the implication that it's therefore inadequate) while not simultaneously acknowledging that one runs into the exact same problem with USD cash transactions would be irresponsible journalism.
I blogged about this very point a couple days ago.

The number of investors listed on a Form D is not the number of individuals. Undoubtedly, large chunks of the investment are institutional (pooling multiple people's).

That logic doesn't quite hold. Someone make the decision to putting resources into cracking it will be doing so based on present value, not theoretical future value. That's like saying that someone who lost 1000BTC in 2010 when it was $5 lost $700k, because that's what it's worth now. Even though they could've gone out and replaced those 1000BTC for $5k at the time.
But if you're expecting this wallet to just sit there ignored and only attract attention once 0.1BTC is worth something, that's all good I suppose.
And to be clear, this analysis ignores subjective cost-benefit factors like curiosity and bragging rights.

It's a big long and obscure, but I highly recommend Moldbug's take on what truly drives demand for money and how they compete with one another. 
tl;dr Money's most important quality in 2014 is as a form of savings, not as a medium of exchange. Every form of "money" that exists is trying to kill all of its competitors, and equilibrium is a

Proof of assets isn't particularly difficult, even in a non-Bitcoin context. Proof of liabilities is the real challenge. It's demonstrating that the 100BTC you're holding matches up against 100BTC worth of deposits, and that you don't have some hidden book elsewhere that shows another 50BTC (or 500BTC) in liabilities to other people.
It's kinda like Leo Bloom's scheme in The Producers.

And it might give you some extra peace of mind to put the paper wallet into a tamper proof bag (e.g. 
In case multiple people have access to wherever you store your paper wallets, anyone has plausible deniability that they didn't copy the key and go empty the wallet (but left the paper wallet as they found it).
If the paper wallets are enclosed inside a tamper proof bag, you'll at least know which copy of the paper wallet got compromised (and therefore hopefully by whom)
