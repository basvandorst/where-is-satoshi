Arent the majority of miners in 3-4 mining pools? Is it not in the miners best interests to, you know, keep mining? If all it takes is 2 pools to agree to a new protocol and between them have 51%+, everyone will else will follow

No, see, that's poor implementation of a secure system. Bitcoin, as a protocol, is just as secure as anything out there. The implementation of the protocol is the issue. Look at the mtgox woes,


This seems to be a unique problem to the USA. The _only_ charge I've seen for transfers between accounts has been for Credit Card Payments using a third party called BPAY; they charge 33-44cents per transfer to the merchants, and it's up to them to pass it on to the consumer. I've never heard of a bank passing this fee on.
Regular account-&gt;account transfers within and between institutions are free

Isnt it a little delusional to think that companies will stay afloat while the nations around them crumble? And, even if they do stay alive, what happens when the Bitcoin blockchain attempts to handle more than a supermarkets worth of transations a second?

That's 7 million people, which seems a bit high. As far as I can tell, there are roughly 100,000 active 'accounts' daily (from blockchain.info), and your average Bitcoin actor probably has 4-6 accounts (pure guesstimation here). If we under-assume the number of accounts each bitcoiner has, that leaves about 25,000 active users a day. 
If we massively under assume that an average bitcoin user only accesses his account bitcoins every 6 months, or every 168 days, that leaves a little over 4 million bitcoin users.
Using awful guesstimated maths, 7 million feels way too high

Do light wallets/third party services not degrade the decentralised-is-good nature of the Bitcoin? This looks more like a bandaid solution to a real problem with the protocol
@_date: 2014-02-18 00:14:32
Again, I dont like _any_ of your *coins, I'm blinded by your stupidity. 
  &gt;&gt;  I can make the argument against dogecoin that it's redundant and is not the most adopted coin
You can, but you should also realise that every fork of Bitcoin is redundant and not the most adopted coin till, hey, the miners all agree that this version isnt actually redundant and is now the most common! My point is that any single technological argument for or against any of the SHA-256 or scrypt coin variants can be applied to all of them. It only comes down to some cult-like, MLM, ideological belief, "I believe that xcoin is the best therefore it is the best! (ignore the fact that I have a large sum of money invested in xcoin and please keep buying more xcoin)"
 &gt;&gt;For a protocol, being good enough (which Bitcoin is) and having greater adoption (which Bitcoin has) is the key to success. 
If this is true for technology, that early adoption and 'good enough' will work forever, kindly explain to me why 802.2, 802.[4-10], 802.[12-14] are no longer used. Why does your computer use Ethernet over Token Ring when it was so much more highly adopted? 
Why the push towards IPv6 instead of sticking with the 'good enough' IPv4? Why BlueRay over VHS? 
All of those technologies were good enough, all of them were more adopted than their competitors, so what happened? Being good enough and having higher adoption rates is irrelevant if the protocol itself is irrelevant


I literally make a living because of non-ignorance about ICT and its history. Stand corrected.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:37:18
What the fuck does any of this have to do with redundancy? Are you mentally retarded? Are you actually legally allowed to use a computer outside of your special ed classes, or do you borrow someones phone on the short bus back home from after school care?
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:15:22
So what advantage does Bitcoin have over something already established, like M-PESA? Or, what advantage does Bitcoin have over any other mobile-based money transfer system that could be establised?
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:25:10
We could each go down corner cases, but I'll concede that, once set up, Bitcoin is _naturally_ easier to transfer money. 
NB: The same system could just as easily be set up for banking accounts, and already exists with things like Amazon single-click and PayPal payments
@_date: 2014-02-13 03:39:40
No it doesn't.
Also, no it wont.
@_date: 2014-02-17 12:58:28
Yes? So what makes you think that it wont, or that any of them wont? Doesnt this just mean that bitcoin is as inherently worthless as doge or quick or whatevethefuckcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-17 12:57:15
I dont think any of the existing cryptocoins has any chance long term adoption, and they both completely miss the original point. All of yourplay money is daft, its all a joke. 
Can you not see that any argument made for or against dogecoin can just as easily be made for or against bitcoin? How is your cognitive dissonance not crippling your every day work life?

Isn't this just centralising a decentralised network, and exposing yourself to additional risks by hosting your information on an attackable system?
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:40:06
So, none ;)
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:18:33
No additional risk doesnt sound right, you're still putting trust in a third party, which inherently has more risks. But otherwise I concede that a user does not need the entire block chain so long as a trusted, third party, centralised actor is involved.
Also I'd like my original question answered if at all possible
@_date: 2014-02-23 01:57:49
Good thing Bitcoin isnt anonymous!
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:58:01


This has to be an unbelievably small subset of humanity thought, right? What rational actor alive has access to an internet connection fast enough to keep up with the blockchain, but cannot open a bank account?
What rational actor cant get a bank account but still goes out and gets a high speed internet connection
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:42:34
Yes really; both are have the same technological hurdles that, if solved, remove the hurdles for both products. If Bitcoin has a future, or no future, because of these hurdles, so does DogeCoin.
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:28:01
Good thing I dont own any USD either!

I can agree with this, but I'm a long time proponent of one-time-creditcard numbers issued on demand, or in advance. Australia doesnt have anything like it, but I understand that the USA does :)


I, Area Man, might be useless at security. I probably have a password along the lines of Password1 or SamTheDog. Should I put my life savings in the trust of my own complete lack of security knowledge, and if I fuck up I lose everything, or with a business who does it for a living and if they fuck up (or even if I fuck up), there's some form of recourse?


This sounds more like a problem with the banking system and one which is not solved with Bitcoin. My transfers are currently free, are they free with Bitcoin? If so, what gain do I receive in this area?
If your transfers arent currently free, does Bitcoin make them free?

If you paid with pogs and tulips would that have been just as cool?

Don't Bitcoiners constantly talk about the ability of the Bitcoin protocol expanding the divisibility from 0.00000001BTC if the need arises? Doesnt this mean that Bitcoin is just as infinite as anything else, including fiat? If the Powers that Be decide to print more paper money, cannot the Powers that Be decide to add more zeros in the protocol? Why is fiat affected by this while Bitcoin is immune from the negatives?
This is obviously ignoring the fact that the same protocol change from adding extra decimal places is just as easily implemented adding more coins;

Care to elaborate as to how online purchases are insecure? I don't believe you.


I keep hearing of Chargebacks, but I've honestly never had an issue with them, a quick ask around the people I know have never had an issue with them (including business owners). I've used them once, when a POS system at a grocery store fell over, restarted, and charged me twice. It was reversed in a manner of days. This would be impossible with Bitcoin, right? I've lost my money forever. Chargebacks within regulated systems are a fantastic


Again, you seem to be under the impression that stealing real money is somehow easier than bitcoin theft? It appears to me that the protocol of each is just as secure, it's up to the human factor to actually ensure it's strength. Bitcoin's human factor seems to be woefully inadequate in this department.


How do Bitcoins make online transactions any safer than a regulated banking system? I [i]daily[/i] transfer money from my account to friends, family, coworkers, anyone, free of charge and nobody needs to do anything special to get my money and spend it on milk and bread.


I wont let this be skimmed over, but I wont spend too much time on it. I'll just throw out Chargebacks as almost removing this as a problem.


Key word being once. Real money payments are really easy period.


Paying by contactless card at POS is zero buttons and quite literally frictionless. Once logged into my bank acount I can transfer realistic sums of money (Up to $10K a day) free of charge within my country. I pay nothing for this service.


I dont care for the economics arguments, I care for how it can improve my daily life at any level of adoption


This is actually an interesting application of digital currency, but *coins is not the answer. A mobile phone will never be able to keep up with the blockchain.


I have no personal experience with this and would like to see some articles on the subject before I comment further.


Again, not an argument for bitcoin. More of an argument for any-other-stable-currency
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:40:17
I'm not really sure what your point was there. I'm right, but I'm wrong. Bitcoin is big, but maybe it wont be.
Any holes in some gimmick like DogeCoin is just as relevant as any other gimmick cryptocurrecny, like Bitcoin. Of course things could change, and they probably will. It's a gamble on chosing which coin will do what, and BitCoiners seem convinced that Bitcoin will win because.
@_date: 2014-02-19 04:33:22
Huh, wasnt aware of the foreign currency ban. I'll have to read up on that, thanks :)

Consider me Average Jo on the street, there doesnt seem to be a compelling reason now, or in the future, for Joe to spend any time contemplating Bitcoin. Proponents say that its the wave of the future and to GET IN, but there's very little evidence or incentive for Area Man and Average Joe to touch the thing.


No to area man, no
