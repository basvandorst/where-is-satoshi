I believe this would amount to forking the blockchain every time there is nefarious activity.

She's not really in any danger. It's just the implication of danger. Why doesn't anyone get this?

Okay, okay. You all make great points. USD is shit and Bitcoin is not yet legitimate. You get a cookie.

You're putting too much thought into it. And this post is misleading. Bitcoin has not been banned in China, domestic Bitcoin exchanges are facing a ban. 'Real world money' as you call it is known as 'fiat' here in Bitcoin land. People here would be happy to go back and forth about which has more value, or is more useless, than the other. And if the 'mechanism' you speak of is just the tech of Bitcoin, then the real world value and the mechanism are synonymous with each other. Bitcoin proves to be valuable because of what it offers and how it works. Faith in Bitcoin is no different than faith in fiat currency.
