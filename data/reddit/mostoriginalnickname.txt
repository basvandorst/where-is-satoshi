The campaign is over, if he keeps talking like a retard during official acts maybe he isn't faking it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:26:39
Oh no
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:42:18
I assume you invested all your available money on Bitcoin, you are gonna be rich!
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:42:48


I mean, have you heard him speak?
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:10:59
I meant broke in terms of your crypto currency portfolio

The thing about Bob is that he smells bad and goes out of breath when he gets up.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:44:40
It was the smart decision
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:38:01
It annoys me when I see people with a lot of money eating fucking delivered pizzas. You can buy any food you want! Fuck you Tai.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:44:11
Just like in [2008]( people were buying the "dip", well that turned out great
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:00:46
At least pay your personal chef to make one with decent ingredients.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:01:34
It's in a box, if it was cooked by his chef it would be in a plate imo
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:32:49
I opened an account with them for Bitcoin and they had no problem, they even helped me do the transaction to Coinbase to avoid fees.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:53:21
And broke if it never goes up again
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:43:04
I respect your perspective but that music started being anoying after a few minutes, specially if you look like Jesus it feels like I am on a cult.
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:51:26
Yeah... Don't
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:44:33
Isn't Microsoft invested in IOTA? Maybe that is a reason
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:20:56
Is it just me or does the binance website not show when you google "binance"? Because it only shows an ad.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:36:16


Wait what? I'm still trying to learn but wasn't it like a 1.5%? Also I heard that it's cheaper to have it on GDAX that is true right? (I'm also looking to put 100€ on Monday)
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:06:20
On a scale of 1 to 10 how sure are you that it will go lower than 20k once it reaches it? I'm about to buy for the first time and not sure if I should wait for that drop haha
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:51:52
Alright so If I just want to put some of my savings to see where this goes and check them in a few years I don't have to worry about these fees.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:25:31
Why shouldn't I leave it there? Sorry if I'm being anoying, I really don't know much.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:13:58

@_date: 2017-12-13 23:23:00
So it's safe, the only way to lose it is if someone hacks into my account (gets my passport somehow) but I shouldn't lose money if coinbase is hacked. Am I understanding you correctly?
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:14:45
I'm new here and have been reading about these high "fees" for a while. Does it mean you have to pay a fee to change Bitcoin to USD and get those on you bank account or is it about some other weird magic you guys do?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:22:46
Morocco is actually not that bad, one of the top countries in Africa.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:16:26
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:17:16
Thank you for your answers guys but I was looking for a podcast to start learning. Thanks anyway very interesting.
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:21:19
I hope you can afford to keep losing money...
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:08:05
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:05:29
I have been hearing that since 17k
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:56:22
Can you read? They can ban crypto just like they ban some drugs, you can't commerce with cocaine.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:40:27
And where is that sweet privacy and decentralization if I have to give my Bitcoin wallet to an insurance company, isn't that just a bank?
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:01:10
Yeah, I'd rather have it be legal just in case I get caught by the police. I don't know how this stupid comment is upvoted.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:53:47


Nice one, but I still don't know what you mean with the rest of your comment
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:03:51
They are the EU and they can ban crypto if they want to under the legal precedent that they pull out of their ass. The enforcement is pretty simple, if you are caught with crypto you get a punishment.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:01:46
I am not English for starters, but according to Google:
Insure: secure or protect someone against (a possible contingency).
Ensure: make sure that (a problem) does not occur.
I thoguht they had the same meaning but I'm happy to learn.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:08:39
Can confirm, I'd rather have my government ensuring my money than having my life savings in a wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:54:33
Yeah guys, not a big deal, just don't ever get caught or leave any hint that you may have bitcoins and you won't be sent to jail! 
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:12:40
You realize how if a currency is banned you won't ever be able to go into Ikea and buy a desk with it?
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:49:24
You said that you don't need their approval, yes you do, if they made it illegal you could get in big trouble.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:56:17
Nope, thank god, I would have lost a lot of money if I bought more at that 17k "dip".
