I see a correlation with fear.  Also at this points it's just the cool thing to do so it's really impossible to read anything with the last 7 days the crypto community has had

Could be good or bad. Maybe you'd have a mill by 20. All speculation. Do what you need to do though man. Good luck

Both sides say only put in what you are willing to lose. The main thing is, in my opinion, what else can you do right now and invest $500 in and possibly be a millionaire in 3 years? No one knows. Put some in. Hodl it. High risk high reward. Who cares about that $500 in 4 years.

Lol. That fee is based on how much ur spending. If you spend 199.99 ur fee is $1. Ur on spending 1400-1500 roughly. Transfer money from coinbase wallet to GDAX. Bank withdraw takes 3-5 days on coinbase. So either pay the fee or buy less for less fee or wait 5 days.

I was helpful. Taught him more than any other speculation post will. He even edited it and changed the $ sign so at least he learned something. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:13:46
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:54:31
Lots of shit posting but we all making money so who cares. Old timers know what's up. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:11
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:02:26
Well no one knows what the future holds so it's all just speculation. No one knows. Hodl. Why not  at this point. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:12:55
If you make that much you can hire someone who can do it for you. And a lawyer lol

I've seen some people last few days saying it's taken them 4-12 hours. It's just high traffic and they can't handle it from what I've heard. Seems normal ATM. Just keep waiting
