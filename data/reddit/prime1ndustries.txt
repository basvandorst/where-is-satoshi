I don't recognize the address of the requester. Anyone else getting these already?

Big injections of capital have slowed down for the time being. Boom and bust cycle. The charts say we have a few months of sideways to gradual movement up before the next boom. Have patience.
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:14:02
People dont want to spend BTC when the price is this low and purchasing power is less. Just wait until the price gets back to ATH's. This is why you hear people stating that we need price stability before it will be prudent to use as a currency.

We don't even know if the Bitcoin was "stolen", and with no one saying anything, what other avenues then are there to pursue? The only focal point at this juncture is MK/Gox.

Everyone is trying to get in at the best price they can. Hence the selling to induce panicked panic sellers to sell. (Say that 3 times fast...) Speculators gonna speculate! Hold on to your butt's...this year is going to be crazy!

I think there is a lot of truth to what you just stated. On the other hand, some will tell you that the price points are predetermined, and the news is manufactured to reflect the manipulation of the price. /tinfoilhat :)

I'm with you on this, but now the question is: why? With my conspiracy hat on...We have seen Bitcoin retail adoption and hints at adoption by some pretty big retailers and businesses, I propose that the dump was to cause overall panic in the market with being able to now say that Bitcoin is too volatile to be used as a currency. Or it could just be the exchanges behind it, and with all of these people being wiped out in their shorting attempts, it makes you go 'hmm'.
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:51:18
I bought a few Humble Bundles a while back. It was Bitcoin well spent.

Tell your partner that by using BitPay as a payment processor, it cuts out the price volatility issue completely, by exchanging to USD automatically on the fly, unless you are planning to keep some Bitcoin (smart). So you incur no risks due to price fluctuations...

I hear ya, me too, but I confess I have spent a little BTC (~.05) on a few things since we dropped below $600.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:17:41
Yeah exactly, he says "one DOGE = one DOGE" in one paragraph, and then goes on in the next to give a USD amount of a DOGE donation. I'm pretty sure that figure was established on an exchange.
@_date: 2014-03-02 03:03:01
You need to find a TRUSTED family member who is savvy with computers, and ask them to look into retrieving them for you. Odds are even if they don't know anything about Bitcoin, they can gather the info to help you. Don't trust anyone contacting you online offering to help.

@_date: 2014-03-04 19:56:08
You think they do things like this to distract people from knowing the decentralized nature of Bitcoin?
If we have an 'Executive Director', Bitcoin is a regular run of the mill company, which is fallible just like any other company and is nothing new. On the other hand, maybe they really are just ill informed dumbasses and don't know a thing about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-01 18:54:09
Your thinking is last year, as we are well past SR now. Things are looking good for Bitcoin with news of the Overstock announcement and more coming. 2014 is looking to be a good year, with or without China.

Thanks for the link
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:47:06
Here here! Quit being a "two bit idiot", and let everything you know out into the public domain. If you care about Bitcoin and the community like you say you do, you will be open with us all and let it be known everything that you know on the Gox matter.

Yes, Cryptsy has had some problems with load due to the massive influx of users interested in BTC and the rest of the alt coins, but is and has been working great since BigVern made some upgrades and changes. Cryptsy is the best and most experienced alt coin exchange hands down.

Were you using 2fa on your email account? ...and use strong passwords? I would run a malware scanner asap, if you haven't thought of that already. Sorry for your loss, no matter how small. It's very disheartening that these things happen, but this is the reality we are in at the moment.

@_date: 2015-01-05 19:16:11
No, the main problem is laziness. Bitcoin users keeping all their funds on exchanges is the issue. Take responsibility and keep your BTC in a secured wallet that is in your possession.

Programming at it's finest....er, worst.
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:20:00
Yes but you have to already have a verified acct to withdraw. I wouldnt want BTC stuck in an unverified acct...
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:50:46
DOGE is a side show/distraction for all the gamblers whilst the BTC and LTC market is sideways and boring. It's only saving grace is it's marketing department. 
@_date: 2015-10-04 18:09:40

My acct as well has been locked for 6+ months now w/ some funds still in it. It's not a lot, but that is *totally* beside the point. I have inquired about it multiple times, but I'm always told that "Vern will have to fix it"...
I've pretty much given up on it at this point. I hope you get your substantial amount back though. I advise against the use of this exchange.

This is a thing obviously. Go BTC! :)
@_date: 2013-10-21 12:52:44
I agree with you. I pretty much knew the BTC community wouldn't really like this, but it is BTC/ASIC related and does affect both camps.
@_date: 2013-09-04 12:46:42
I like the printed QR code idea!
You would then have a paper record of the transaction to file. Could write other pertinent info on the code.
It would really be quite simple and hassle free to start accepting BTC.
The POS idea is great. You could build your own POS quite easily if you are technically inclined.
Take care and good luck!
