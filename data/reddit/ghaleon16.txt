The Bit Instant guys were moving mad volume. 6000 BTC a day and at that point banking at least 10%....
These dudes were gathering like 500 coins a day in dust.....
The BBB had thousands of complaints against them because they simply couldn't keep up with demand. Once MT Gox's funds were seized, they lost their fiat pillow as well.... hence they took the "site under construction" route.... and bailed.
Good dudes but they under estimated the demand and the work in scaling up. They should have been upfront with their customer.. no one is perfect tho.
for a replacement I now use 
Their support is AWESOME and they turn around btc quick! these are the two things I look for. They also show their faces on their website and answer the phone all the time.
anyone in this space has to put trust first and see themselves as building a brand, not just a fly by night operation.
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:46:45
yup. makes alot of sense!
@_date: 2014-10-26 02:20:19
could use more diversity in basketball too me thinks...and hockey lol

i uploaded my source code there into a folder aka chest and people can buy ir or make donations in paypal, cc or bitcoin, the site pays out in bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-10-15 08:25:32
good to know just what backsup Bitcoin, it is a ton of work!
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:37:24
ok, so you work at Coin Base?
Cool. I respect you guys, you;re cleary working hard but you need to be more transparent with the order cancelations. 
I don't feel too sorry for you guys cause you got what 30 million?
I know it takes time to find good people and straighten out the process flow but seriously guys if you spent half the time talking to your customers as on reddit, these threads wouldn't exist.
We always answer support calls all the time, why? cause we learn something new each and every time. You guys can too. It will make you a better company.
The last part of your comment really sounds like a threat. I know you guys are going at it vicious with Bitpay and down voting each others threads but seriously we are 0 threat to you. We help folks cure their laptops from viruses and get their files back. Hardly laundering anything.
Better support, less threats and reddit trolling, more transparent policies and you guys will be tops.
@_date: 2014-01-23 13:00:25
hmm ok.
well the coin cafe dudes sold me the btc at the bitstamp price, lil under actually so the price they sell isn't the coindesk price. check their faq. 
John is a swell dude. he got 2 french bull dogs bro. gotta be cool.

citibank. 20 year old account
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:13:09
hot dog!!!!!
like the honky tonk and blue grass of old times!!!
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:58:14
Well guys... guess what...
they canceled my other transaction 
5 BTC for 680. it was from my personal account with Citibank... had the account since 1991 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Same Bs excuse. High Risk!!!
AND they canceled ANOTHER transaction just now from a different account....
what is up with Coinbase??!?!?!
first Gox and now Coinbase. what is happening? BTc-e under the gun in russia?
only Bitstamp and BTC China now???
@_date: 2014-11-11 00:06:14
this is huge. 
but to make it stick we need to mobilize the bitcoin community to support those merchants who decide to opt in.
check out easybitz.com and signup. these guys support every city on earth and their map updates in real time. bitcoin has gotta grow grass roots, can't expect the big corps to do it for us.
@_date: 2014-01-22 12:45:57
Kay is pretty awesome! He really gets it and he is keeping the bitcoin not fiat. gonna pay him a visit tonight.
I also hear some persian dude is selling persian shoes for bitcoin. we need more interviews on merchants taking bitcoins. real brick n mortar folks like this.
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:21:09
was using my citi bank account which i have had for two decades at least
@_date: 2014-12-31 22:01:14
why u hatin?
@_date: 2014-10-02 08:39:47
seems like easybitz is different cause it shows the merchants accepting bitcoin in real time. meaning you see merchants who just got paid.
pretty genius concept. but how do they know? they gotta be a processor too. so for this to work these guys must sign up merchants.
tough gig but this seems like the right way
@_date: 2014-12-06 07:14:32
where do u suggest it go? this is the best news I've seen all week. finally someone with cojones and he gets bitcoin. we get him.
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:27:34
if u sell on the street check out easybitz. good support too
@_date: 2014-01-20 07:02:03
Bitcoin is REAL money.
anyone who has studied the history of money and knows how the central banking system "makes money" knows that bitcoin is much more REAL than the USD.
only thing backing USD... US NAVY
Bitcoin is backed by electricity and the passion of millions who are sick of the banks .
support all the peeps making bitcoin liquid. 
check out 
These guys are opening up a real cafe and also sell bitcoins online, can buy with check, wire or deposit cash into their bank account.
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:32:01
didn't see this and posted bout it, kudos, genius and simple idea!
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:37:39
wtf is wrong with u dude??
u want bitcoin to be worthless? why r u here?
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:28:43
you don't . you are obviously a power user.
but if you need someone who answer the phone at 4 in the morning and will hold your hand and get you the coins within minutes then come to us.
We'll even make u a cupa coffee. 
We bought our coins at around $850 so yeah we gotta cover ourselves. otherwise we're better off doing something else. We didn't get 50 million in Vc funding.
Hope you understand.

$860 is the coindesk price.
it was on par with coinbase. anyone know why the coinbase price is going so low?
@_date: 2014-12-31 22:01:05
hater's gonna hate...
@_date: 2014-11-16 10:55:43
think they meant fancy compared to the fast food places accepting bitcoin now... hmmm are there any fast food places accepting bitcoin?
lukes lobster wasn't when I went last.
@_date: 2014-11-11 00:16:22
check out keychests.com
they let u upload files and collections, accept bitcoin, cc and pays out in bitcoin.
using it for my code snippets.
@_date: 2014-10-28 20:39:45
get them on easybitz.com that way we can see them get bumped to the top each time they accept btc.
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:56:50
this is def every different from what we have been seeing. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:33:06
pretty fair.
they should make it clear then that they can refuse any transaction at any time for a bad price for them then, or spike their rate to cover them. not give a bs answer like "high risk"
We raise our rates to cover ourselves and tell folks about coinbase and buylocalbitcoins cause it may be a better fit for them. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 06:59:00
who cares what they do. they will prob work with the easybits company , makes no sense to go to the merchants. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 23:04:09
sure is.
love the diversity too. nerdy white dudes r ok... some of my best bros.. but we have way to many of em in Bitcoin land
@_date: 2014-01-18 12:34:06
if you wanna get up and running really fast try these guys.
just need a cellphone.
@_date: 2014-11-10 23:48:11
will be there! asap!
@_date: 2014-10-11 05:05:20
Northern Somalia is also a great example of this!
We can't just depend on press to get us there, we must push this.
@_date: 2014-10-14 07:00:48
we all gotta work together to show these guys support.
me and a friend spent like a week getting our neighborhood coffee shop to take btc. he tried it for a week, but after it was only us going there he just stopped, didn't bother to train the new workers.... we really need to keep the pressure on. 
maybe u guys should have a chat box on the map site. hopefully it doesn't turn into a btce troll box lol
@_date: 2014-10-22 17:14:38
yeah, easybitz has been doing this in nyc for a few months now. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 21:33:58
I'm not into clickbait but they do mention they had a meetup on the blog post so I'm not sure why the haters r here. 
We need more folks working brick n mortar for bitcoin. 
check out their site  reminds me of foursquare. You can see places but not people. I wouldn't mind letting merchants know what neighborhood I am in. As a merchant myself I wanna know where bitcoiners are.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:44:57
already using it for some source i never put on github. good for smaller stuff! got a few mbtc already
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:41:56

@_date: 2014-12-13 00:57:54
this guy right? awesome!
@_date: 2014-11-16 10:56:42
these guys put up a whole video of them accepting bitcoin.
what are you complaining about? lol seriously.
@_date: 2014-10-26 02:19:36
lol. i recognized it too.. digging thru the ost to figure out which song it is.
major geekery here
@_date: 2014-12-06 03:00:41
we need 1000 guys like this standing up for their rights!!!
Sending him some BTC!
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:26:34
Check out 
This is the only real solution, a living map that bumps merchants to the top each time they accept bitcoin and it shows when their last transaction was. Kinda like a forum. pretty simple and effective. Also have a leaderboard and lets people signup merchants and get ranked by how much they spend, kinda like FourSq for bitcoin.
These guys have been in the game the longest. They make videos featuring their merchants as well. 
This is the kinda tool we need to really support the merchants supporting us. We should all get on this.!
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:46:14
got two confidants.... best designed notebook ever and you guys are bitcoin warriors!
luv ya
@_date: 2014-11-16 03:37:32
almost certainly they converted. unless their suppliers take btc. which is highly doubtful. NYC food suppliers are like straight from the old country. delt with them for years when I ran a chain's inventory.
will def check this spot out! nice!
@_date: 2014-11-27 17:07:39
they should sell bitcoin they earn. that would be something!
coinback.io makes it pretty easy
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:44:19
The guys at EastBitz gave a presentation on this. 
They say the same thing as they have been going thru this for over 8 months. 
The first two rules of Bitcoin for retail is... never mention Bitcoin...
But they have it down pretty pat and say u should always instead talk about it as a rewards program... which in a way it kinda is. it all pivots on being able to send them new loyal customers.. that is pretty rewarding for a merchant
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:38:59
Bitcoin will recover 10X stronger.
Anti b it coin trolls paid in fiat to troll against BitCoin will soon be demanding to be paid in BitCoin to troll against BitCoin..
Face it . .. WE WON
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:40:04
The real issue here is ways to earn bitcoin. mining is now outside the realm of the average joe. trading it in for usd is still tough even with places like coinbase.  we need to bring in the army of young college kids without btc or usd.
and we need a way for all those hording it waiting for it to hit 1 million $ to loosen up their purse strings
how do we do that? 
We need more market places for BTC!
Two of my friends built  to do this for all files, books, videos, music etc..
We need more ideas like btc for cam girls. etc..
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:55:36
This is the bitcoin project I am most excited about. ! ! way to go guys you have 1000x more fans than haters but as we all know... the more haters the more daring the project!
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:30:27
yup. they just scream"get a lawyer" lol
lawyers are EXPENSIVE and now his funds are being held.
We should blow this story up, and help it get press to shame the bank
