I like Airbitz the best. No other wallet lets you tag transactions (like 'coffee with ted'), and it has a build in directory showing places that accept BTC.

yes, and it allows companies to mine the coins serve them best. Now that we have choice of currency, we can use cloud computing to run our own banks. 
I suppose it also means we have to be sure Microsoft and Amazon don't have the power to censor. I think cryptography + redundancy can overcome that threat.

This is fantastic! Great presentation, and I do appreciate that it took some time. Would you mind if I printed it for our office? It's an interesting timeline to keep. You should continue. Imagine what a laugh it will give us 5 years from now.

Indeed, they've been offering could blockchain services etherium, factom, and maybe others. But this is the first i've seen offering hash power.

What type of qualifications must the brokers meet? Could it integrate localBitcoins?

The username and password Airbitz asks for is just another way of creating a pass phrase, and does not go to any centralized server. All your private and public keys are generated on your device. These keys, along with your transactional data,  is encrypted using AES256, then backed up to p2p Git servers. To decrypt, we need a 256 bit key. The Airbiz wallet combines username+password then hashes this on you device using Scrypt with a minimum set of (N,r,p) parameters of (16384,1,1). This gives you a 256 bit key, allowing you to see your encrypted data. Vuala! You get real decentralized privacy with the familiar feel of mobile banking.  
I'm a bitcoin advocate and I love to give people this wallet. It's far less intimidating than having to write down 12 words, but still upholds Bitcoin principles of decentralization and privacy. Check out Airbitz FAQs and Sinc server architecture if you want to get a better look under the hood. They are very transparent.

Sending to Changetip is similar to sending to a paypal account. The recipient doesn't truly own the bitcoin until they move it to a wallet where they hold the private key. The Airbitz wallet is great because it feels easy to set up an account (username+password), and users hold their own keys. Exposing someone to Bitcoin is a great opportunity to teach the importance of responsible Bitcoin habits like holding your own keys and protecting your privacy. It's also cross platform (iOS &amp; android).

So if the proof of work solution is found, but the miner is backloged on verifying transaction, they can post the new block empty, and fill it later? 
Also, I'm confused about SPV mining. Isn't the primary role of miners to fully validate transactions? Are miners taking shortcuts?

Thanks for the lunch-time inspiration! People don't usually associate technology with tenderness and emotion, but you are spot-on for making the link. It's the desire to connect with others that pushes innovation.
