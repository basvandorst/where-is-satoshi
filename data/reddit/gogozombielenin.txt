Well if there is no hyperinflation there will be no need to burn your bitcoin for kindling.

Can we just agree that everyone on reddit is autistic already? What you should type is "are you an idiot?" which is the line I edit out of 90% of my reddit comments.

Fucking statists, and their killer robots.

Ha no one is going to pay for healthcare in the future. Haven't you even seen Star Trek?

People are suffering because their currency is controlled by the state. How is that not relevant to bitcoin? Doesn't this make the case for stateless money?

It is fun watching the price contemplating cashing out to pay the rent. Today I could pay my rent for 6 months. Tomorrow I might be able to buy a lambo or maybe a coffee.

Huh, I usually just use my Shift card. Of course no woman would ever want me to buy her a drink, but I totally could do it with btc if I wanted to.

Its the best kind of anarchist or the worst kind of communist depending on who you ask.

Right, is that the problem for you? Or is there some other way he fails to live up to the ideals of fascism?
@_date: 2018-07-23 07:17:30
Why do we all have to stereo-type each other online? You can acknowledge Trump is a fascist without being a democrat. Personally I'm an anarcho-communist. Can we not assume everyone is a partisan or russian troll?

The working class. That is the whole idea after all that the working class seizes the means of production and expropriates the ruling class. We wouldn't want to centralize legitimacy in any institution so you wouldn't have the military of Anarchistan, it would be more likely to be a decentralized network of militias like the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG/YPJ)

Is he not anti-semitic enough for you?

Explain? I keep on genuinely trying to figure out what you're talking about but you make no sense to me. Other comments lead me to believe you're a national socialist which means you want some kind of ethnostate with state controlled industry? Now, you're accusing me of having the support of the state, because I'm an anarchist? Because the cops didn't stand by and let someone get murdered at Charlottesville? Oh wait, they did? Because they aren't trying to pass a bill targeting antifa. Oh wait they are?
Let me blow your mind for a minute then. Whiteness is a social construct and itself a form of multiculturalism. There is no single white culture, just as there is no singular black culture or any other culture associated with a skintone. Your ideology in so far as I understand national socialism (you seem afraid to explain it to me), is that Aryans (Germans) are the master race and must maintain their racial purity. Go back to europe if you want to be a nativist. White people don't come from turtle island, numbnuts. Racial purity does not make people stronger it makes them genetically weaker. Look at what happened to the inbred royal families, or the amish. Pictures of purity, but not something anyone would ever aspire to. But you want a society for one culture. Oh what are we gonna eat tonight? Well the chinese place is closed, haven't been able to get a decent taco since the purge... I really wanted a bagel this morning couldn't get that... ok now let me go listen to an american genre of music that doesn't have its roots in black music... Your white utopia sucks balls. My utopia is way better: @_date: 2018-07-23 08:47:59
Well I'm glad we agree the future will be fully automated luxury space communism. Space communists would get rid of coal miners, while capitalists will fight to keep them because they are making a profit burning that coal.
edit: And yes I'm fine living in a society where robots do all the work and everyone is some kind of ridiculous wannabe rockstar... Although I think we can be a bit more practical than that. Also to my mind this is a moral issue. Like should developmentally challenged people live in poverty because their labor is less valuable? Of course not. It follows that no one should live in poverty no matter how valuable their labor is in a society that is capable of producing a surplus.

We currently have a network of concentration camps for immigrant kids. Now the government wants to go after naturalized citizens. Is this not fash enough for you somehow? Trump is fash through and through. You can see it in the way he licks the boots of authoritarian strong men like Putin and Erdogan. The fash that don't support Trump usually say its because he's "controlled by the jews" given that he is surrounded by jews and they have a problem with that.
What kind of fascism do you support?

Uh I'm an anarchist numbnuts. My leadership is non-existenant. Good luck finding a Zionist anarchist. Israel is an apartheid state. We're against all forms of oppression. So Trump isnt fash enpugh because he hasnt nationalized the economy? I still dont understand. Also, shouldnt the fash support Israel, It is a jewish ethnostate. Isnt that what ya'll want everyone has to go back to their own ethnostate? Stephen Miller the most prominent fascist in the administration is Jewish.

I don't expect you to agree with me. Read the wikipedia page if youre interested.
