Same here. Several purchases and one sale even.

If you had to do it then so be it. It's done. I would consider the current address 'at risk' at this point. Generate a new address, move the coins, and tuck your private key somewhere safe. Better safe than sorry right?

I'm fairly sure the tax man wants the $ regardless of the technology. The article doesn't mention S2X as a pro-government tool.

The article reads like the sky is falling.
I agree there would be a disruption of some kind if 90% of all hashpower disappeared at one time. Everything would go from 10 minutes to 100 minutes. Would that cause all miner to jump ship because they could not sell quick enough? Two possibilities that come to my mind just off the top:
1) With the speed of hash power increases, we could wait a short bit and get back to normal
2) The community could agree to reduce difficulty with a code release

Not to be paranoid... how can we be sure it is safe before it hits our phones. It's a fun idea, but sometimes I'm just good old fashion paranoid.

Hop on Coinbase and buy Bitcoin?  (I couldn't help myself)
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:15:36
Liquidity is very low. The prices could widely until volume picks up again. I suspect everyone is waiting and holding there breath.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:14:04
How would you accomplish this without major fees? I look at the fee structure on something like Coinbase and you would be far better doing $300/month.
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:42:23
You are right. It is much safer to keep the coins off an exchange. If you control the keys then they are yours. Have a look at Trezor.io. There is a great FAQ on there. Short version, you want to generate your own address and tell Coinbase to ship your coins over to it.

Remember not to upset the tax man. No point in buying long term trouble.

I'm glad. It doesn't need to skyrocket or swing wildly every day. Price stability with a slow steady climb gives it credibility. It helps all the non-Bitcoiners overcome their fears and join the cause. Most people have no exposure to this and don't understand the whole of the situation. They need to feel safe enough to investigate the ecosystem so that they will be a part of it. It's going to climb over time. Let's get everyone on-board.

BCC? Like it or not, BCC is at $757 as I type this.
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:10:02
Umm. Do you really think so? The number don't support your supposition.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:01:25
Out of coins again perhaps? Not a very reliable platform at this point.
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:44:56
This one
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:57:32
Hmm.  I think you just asked for his seed. &lt;end of 8th grade humor&gt;
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:21:21
Good to know. Thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2017-08-25 04:05:47
And here I was, just about to ask for the 12 words so I could help. D'oh!
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:37:48
I jumped the gun there...
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:43:19
Yeah.  Not a lot of traffic to it. It looks good though!
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:10:17
We have one at the mall in Roseville California.
