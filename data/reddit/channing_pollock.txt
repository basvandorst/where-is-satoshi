If you research GLD you will find that they are not required to own physical gold to underpin all of their ETF paper.  How/why would a BTC ETF be any different?
I suspect that if everyone who had wanted exposure to Gold had bought bullion instead of ETFs and other derivatives, the price of gold would be much higher.

Good points.
Another consideration is that when Wall St finally manages to erect a massive scaffolding of financialization around BTC so they can finally make money off of it, it will enable shorting on a huge scale.
If course shorts need to be covered in order to profit (or stop losses), but so far there has been very little ability to sell BTC unless you akready own it.
I can't help but think that the current state of purity in BTC - finite supply, no shorting, no derivatives - is a powerful driver in the BTC bull market.

The ETFs would hedge themselves by hodling enough BTC to cover any withdrawals, but ya, a 'run on the bank' if everybody wanted to cash out at once would force them insolvent.  Sort of like unauthorized fractional reserve banking. But all that chicanery means creation of artificial supply.

Wait - you’re seriously asking what to do? If your conscience isn’t telling you 100% that you should return to the seller and either pay the man or return his BTC, then your parents should be ashamed of how they raised their son.
