This has been posted before about Breadwallet but since you're revisiting this I figured I would share. You can use bread wallet as a cold storage. Start a new wallet on BW and then write your recovery phrase down. WRITE IT DOWN ON MULTIPLE PIECES OF PAPER. Don't just store the phrase on your phone (wouldn't recommend anyway). Then add your Bitcoin to the BW wallet. Once you have the BTC you want to have kept in storage, simply go to settings and push "start/recover another wallet". Enter your phrase for that particular wallet and it will then go into cold storage and you can start a new wallet with a different recovery phrase. Also helps me to not have it at disposal so I panic sell and think I'm some day trader and lose money.

I don't think a vacation in Tijuana is a great destination spot. Especially with the amount of money they have.

And really funny. 
I’m almost the opposite, kinda sick of talking bitcoin to the same people I’ve already talked to about It. My father in law bought a couple grand worth around 13K and he runs up and says, “I almost pulled the trigger and sold at 19 but next thing I know, it’s down before I could decide to pull the trigger! I guess you gotta take your lumps.” 
Bitcoin gets brought up and next thing you know they’re asking how much you have and I personally don’t like to talk about It. I told my wife to tell people that ask, “my husband does that stuff, I don’t know”. Which leads to me saying, “pft, not enough” which is 1000000% true but doesn’t say much about what you hold. Just be careful guys, serious money can do shit to people. Maybe it’s paranoia but better safe than sorry.

Even the internet is censored in some aspects in different areas of the world and  not everybody uses the internet. Even then, people have different views on how the internet SHOULD be used. You’re reaching. 
I’m not saying there isn’t without a doubt going to be a coin/token/platform that dominates... but other coins/tokens/platforms will exist, was the point of my original comment. Bitcoin has proven to be more of an asset at the moment than a means of a currency. 
So yes, the internet is worldwide. But, not everybody has access to It. Also, every country uses the internet for different sites, services, etc. Facebook is the leading social media service but people don’t like It, don’t use It, maybe never even heard of It. Facebook dominates, yet there’s reddit, Twitter, Snapchat, etc...
Worldwide, currency exists, yes, but there’s different forms of It. Euros, rupee, pounds, yen. Just like there will be different forms of crypto. Way too early to determine which ones will stay or go.

Chuck said that humans inherently need more than one thing, different languages, different fiat, different religions, etc. Especially when it comes to money, not everybody is going to agree on one solution to it. Some coins and tokens will be bigger than others, sure, and many will go down to 0 and that’s alright, not every business or start up succeeds, that’s just reality. There definitely won’t just be one coin or platform that prevails. 
Just focus on what you believe in and don’t worry about the others. No matter what you’re into and think, there are others that are like minded.

To be real real. I bought in last year to the month and had no idea about the halving or this etf. I just loved the idea of bitcoin as a tech and a way to pay/barter. 
Since buying in, I've now made a Reddit account to follow r/bitcoin. I've never felt a better "stress" since jumping on board when it was around $450. Been a wild ride and I intend on hodling on for dear life regardless of the outcome. Good luck to all in whatever you decide to do with her btc.

I'm not scared but a little upset about the community. When I first joined, the community was so upbeat and optimistic. Felt like every other week, something new was being brought to the table. Now all it is is people bitching and moaning while the price steadily drops. While the price is nowhere near where it started or even from what I bought into for, it's still kinda saddening to see that our own community is killing it. Meanwhile, Ether community are happy as clams, dapps coming out every other day, different companies buying in. I'm getting a little turned off of bitcoin. If all it is is just hodling and waiting to see if we are going to fork or not while other coins are actually being innovative... peace?

I buy on Coinbase through my iOS and generally keep on bread wallet and convert some in kraken for ETH (have a small amount)... I was just buying BTC (started at around $400-450). Being new, I didn't really know the different exchanges. I just recently downloaded Bitcoin ticker to help track prices from different exchanges... Do you guys recommend shopping around at different exchanges and diversifying or just using 1, 2 or even 3 exchanges? Like I said, I'm fairy new to "the game" but am bullish on crypto$. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

Here's an interesting approach for breadwallet cold storage.  Create a new breadwallet wallet and write the seed phrase down on paper and store it somewhere safe (preferably in 2 locations).  Transfer the funds to your breadwallet.  Then use the breadwallet "reset wallet" feature to wipe the seed from the iphone.  (Don't just delete the breadwallet app as the seed phrase will still reside in the keychain - this is something that needs to be made clearer for breadwallet users).  Now you have a very simple cold storage solution.
Copied that from another subreddit. New to this so I don't know how to link it here but this is a great way to store away some BTC.

I use Coinbase, it's nice for the beginner and for advanced. It's just simple. It does ask for ID and CC which I feel is more secure. I didn't and don't use it for illegal purchases and being anon isn't a huge deal for me. After purchasing BTC, I would store it somewhere off the actual exchange (Breadwallet is easy to use/learn and is safe). If you intend on using your BTC after purchasing, keeping it on the exchange is fine. They're secure but not a whole lot can happen if they're hacked, (Mt Gox, Bitfinex... google if you don't know) keep that in mind. I'm not hardcore and I only bought some for investing and to diversify a bit. I love the idea of Bitcoin and all it's been doing is rising in price. 
If you want to "set it and forget it" I recommend breadwallet, I use it myself.
What I did was add my BTC on breadwallet and then used it as "cold storage", offline storage basically. Once you create a wallet, they give you a 12 word phrase. WRITE IT DOWN SOMEWHWRE! Then after writing down the phrase and adding your coin, I went into settings and hit "create a new wallet". What it does is store your CURRENT wallet with coin in it into offline storage, which can only be brought back with your 12 word phrase. It then creates a fresh wallet to do what you want with. I would write the 12 word phrase down onto 2 different pieces of paper and put them in safe places (safe, safety deposit box, mamas house, etc...). 
That's the basics.

I was painting the exterior of a home and I started to whistle while listening to music. The neighbor yells at me to stop It. I take my headphones off and ask her if she’s talking to me. She said, “ya! Do i make you nervous or something?” And I said excuse me? She said, “Apologize right now!” She was pointing and shaking her head from being so mad. “You say sorry for whistling!” I asked her, “you really want me to say sorry for whistling?” She didn’t say anything. Just looked at me like she was about to jump over the fence and rush me. I also couldn’t tell if she was “all there” so I thought for a second. I told her, “I’m not going to apologize for whistling, fuck off”
