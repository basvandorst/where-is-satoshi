.ski? does that even exist
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:50:04
Roger Ver is rude too. And its not just with me.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:43:01
I have very bad programming skills so I think Im able to do it.
That was a proposal last week but nobody joined me :(
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:17:44
fake sub
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:07:24
We could have avoided many problems if everyone used Bitcoin Core wallet but downloading the entire blockchain is just... too much.
Although is the best way to keep it alive. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:48:38
Don't tell me what I can tell or not.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:39:47
i agree with this, so many fake coins but only the true Bitcoin has all the hype.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:14:42
dont tell me twice sir
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:29:49
Maybe processing transactions!?
Thats what miners do
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:02:37
Amazing, Bitcoin Cache
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:43:19
imagine filecoin lol
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:11:01
exactly, thanks
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:46:57
I know but you can specify in Details (optional). Im sure if they get enough reports the text will be visible and probably do some research over their website.
Of course is highly unlikely to mark it as phishing lol but would be fun. Worth reporting anyway for Google algorithm :)
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:52:44
.coin exists!
And its decentralized btw
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:25:52
Yea, kind of.
But is not Bitcoin. Lets B realistic, lol.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:24:20
Well Bitcoin != Bcash, but I dont see Ubuntu making references to Xubuntu.
Thats what Rover Ger is doing.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:04:49
The core of Bitcoin is the center of it. The concept.
But yea understandeable. Still better than stealing the name, forking it and claiming that Bcash is the original Bitcoin. is ridiculous
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:28:22
ASIC came probably mid July 2013... Back in time mining BTC was totally possible with an usual desktop, I remember having some satoshis just by let it running
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:11:53
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:44:25
None man, computers can do it automatically lol
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:24:42
I dont want people being misinformed by a pro-bitcoin-fork altcoin aka Bcash website named as bitcoin[.]com, when it has little or nothing to do with bitcoin.
Just be quiet if you came here to talk shit. This is not r\btc
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:22:29
But a  twitter shouldnt be talking about bcash alt-coin... Every single tweet is about bcash and not Bitcoin itself. Doesn't make any sense.
Roger Ver is alone creating this coin battle. 2 different coins must treated differently.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:41:25
Do your maths... in 30 minutes it should have almost 20upvotes :)
EDIT: it is clear that r/btc sub is controlled by alt-coins
The most sad thing here is that they use Bitcoin legit name to spread fake alt-coin propaganda (roger ver)
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:47:54
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:52:11
yes correct. i agree with you but isnt it a bitcoin sub (at least it uses Bitcoin name too, just like the twitter  that bought for Bcash advertise) 
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:59:15
thats not the point man... It has negative votes, doesnt matter if its 12 hours or 12 days
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:23:00
Happy Birthday BLOCKCHAIN :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:18:09
im too high to understand the whole sentence sry
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:50:56
Don't use bitcoin ".com" because of Roger Ver and his altcoin. Better now?
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:38:00
hodl your shit together
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:32:34
 Im very agressive &gt;:( Be careful with me 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:00:05
This is why r/Bitcoin community is just amazing!
Oh ma gawd :')
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:33:13


This. And more shameful is what is doing. He is the actual scum of cryptocurrency. Im just waiting for "Bcrash", let's see what mr roger is capable of :D :D
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:16:58
Not as stupid as you. Go check the number of votes now!
Idiot. Im just complaining how ridiculous the fucking r/btc sub to alert new redditors... 
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:12:21
i used it long time ago. now javascript wallets are way more practical but they work like a bus, everyone takes the ride.
and thats bad for blockchain because web wallet users, for instance, are not mining and therefore not contributing for blockchain
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:10:14
That megathread is confusing as fuck
EDIT: I mean its a megathread... But the guide!?
EDIT2: Not everyone is following the megathread... 
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:22:57
Just like Roger Ver aka  bought Twitter  handle and keeps tweeting about Alt-coin BCash
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:11:40
Nice for the MAPS team, keep up with the good research!
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:14:17
btw u forgot Reddit man, they deserve
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:56:31
I bought LSD with my bitcoin, now I just have an empty wallet...
How to refund pls
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:49:48
Maybe not.
@_date: 2018-05-09 20:38:26
Wait what? Does it count as extra? 
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:39:37
That dude just went full retard... 
@_date: 2018-05-07 10:42:33
Yes lets pretend he's jailed lol
Anyway do not ignore his attemps to mislead and misinform possible new investors. Things must be placed in palce: BTC is BTC and BCH is BCH.
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:15:38
Thanks CMC :)
@_date: 2018-05-08 22:53:49
Lol dude i hope u are trolling, I deny to use this shit coin...
How is that even possible if this wallet only have bitcoin blockchain transactions!?!?
I mean, it must have Bitcoin balance... Will try to import into Electrum
@_date: 2018-05-03 22:56:16
feels way smoother and decentralized than bitcoin,com commercial shit
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:41:47
This. Someone wrote an article regarding this blockchain issue. Will try to find brb
@_date: 2018-10-24 07:34:19
retard and scammer. I srsly hope that someone with money prosecute him because of bitcoin.com past scams... IMHO i think there is something being analysed already
@_date: 2018-10-23 23:43:07
BitcoinCash is an epic fail. Sorry Retard Ver
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:54:21
"If you dont own the private key, you dont own the coins". Lesson learned?
Good luck tho...
@_date: 2019-06-18 15:29:45
The scammer Roger Ver(me) strikes again!
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:24:58
noo thats too long
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:34:50
Upvote for 3Brown1Blue reference!

@_date: 2017-11-10 13:24:22




@_date: 2017-11-06 17:03:15
congratz, you've just revealed yourself to the internet...
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:49:15
HODL! road to the million
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:02:28
i think so
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:58:20

@_date: 2017-11-26 16:14:37
Ok got it, Bitcoincharts seems to be way more customizable
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:56:31
are u serious castor?
@_date: 2019-04-16 09:15:02
The Crypto Clown...
@_date: 2019-04-14 21:57:21
Or course they will. People will buy Bitcoin when it is more expensive because it has more value.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:35:09
This physics guy
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:47:52
Thanks comrade!
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:21:50
Thats why I wrote was. Not a coin for the long run.
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:16:09
BCH is/was useful when Bitcoin is clogged with tx but is not a replace or a "new version" of Bitcoin. At all.
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:04:14
Before Bcash it was, probably
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:36:50
HODL &lt;3
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:37:53
buy high sell low thats the secret

@_date: 2018-04-08 09:17:49
For fuck sake finally... Ive reported it many times.
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:51:53
@_date: 2018-04-30 12:37:04
it means that bcash is even worse than a meme lol
you created a meme
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:25:29
just like the idiot of Roger Ver, he is another deceptive icon
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:39:07
this hurts.
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:39:21
either way
