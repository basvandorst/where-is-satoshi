I read that the crazy internet money was to buy drugs and hoomans...

I am think of Square. How is the transaction time from after your account gets verified to having Bitcoin in your personal wallet?
@_date: 2018-05-04 01:27:07
So how did this last one get through in 5 hours? Not complaining. Happy in fact, just odd.
@_date: 2018-05-18 12:34:33
Very sparse around here and charge nearly 10%

UPDATE: The funds are not available. First time that has happened.

In my experience if you deposit to Coinbase, your money clears faster than on Coinbase Pro. I then transfer to pro and do a limit buy. $0.50 fee.
Ex:11-8-19 I deposited to pro, funds clear on 11-15. Deposited to Coinbase on 11-18 and it was credited today.

Did not know. In fact was told opposite. Thanks for sharing!

Your fiat is insured on Coinbase. Your crypto is not.

I would understand that. I actually bought from my linked bank account. I forgot about it to be honest, was not a large purchase, for about 2 weeks.
@_date: 2019-06-20 23:45:24
Possible 
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:53:29
Thanks for the warm fuzzies about bank account...

From my linked bank account.

Coinbase alternatives? stated coinfloor.
Any others? Have any of you used the Cash app?

All laws will be exploited. FIFY ☮️
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:16:38


It's already happening. Heard of red flag laws? Now add to that what we know of 'swatting'....
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:26:45
Because someone called the "authorities", hence the tie in to swatting.

What is the magic number? By magic, I mean total at the end.  
Also, the collapse of the US government will happen, and the world following, within the next 20 years without an extreme change. The system is fucked and unsustainable. Even the peeps at Reason magazine are becoming collapsitarians. And they are some pretty well educated people about how government works and the monetary policy.

Great! This is what I experience with buying stocks with Vanguard. Takes a week or so to get verified.

Stop touching me!

On the recent dip. My first buy was the first time it hit $7.5K after the astronomical high. I was always interested but skeptical. I work in IT(mostly database management and can write code in several languages), am 47 YOA, and knew about it from the beginning time. TBH, my thoughts were "Oh how nice! Someone is trying to make internet money!" Did not read the white paper. Let all of the bad press fill my head and left it alone. Kicking myself in the ass for not buying at $500 or so. Shit I coulda been mining back in the day. I was an overclocker enthusiast and could have used those rigs.  
I know, TMI.  
I'll go back to my corner.... 
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:31:27
As a note, I told the owner of our the company I am married to(the company, not him) not to get involved. He is HEAVILY invested into a a mining operation. Started at $8K or so. He got 12 and has not received one in over two months. But he got play money like dat. 
So don't feel to bad peeps!
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:16:14
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:35:03
My previous last spot was $5900 or $5700 I think. That stayed for a while! Then it tanked again. I think I bought in at $3800 this last grand, so at least I am making a little profit there. But I really do not think I will ever convert to dollars unless I at least triple at all buys. Then wait for another dip and do a full buyback. Shit plan but good for me!
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:02:03
Thank you! But I hope bitcoin makes me solvent!
@_date: 2018-11-28 12:43:33
Thanx for the early morning lulz!

I have virtual ones if that turns you on...

I believe in it, but 98% of my wealth is tied up in the stock market or the dollar. I do not wish it, but the system as it is, is, inevitable for a complete meltdown. We will be paying 100% of the GDP to entitlements and the interest on the debt. That does not include military spending(the biggest ticket item - I am a peace advocate and a minarchist). The system is not sustainable. We have a two party system here and neither wants to deal with the problem facing them. If I go further, this will get political and I do not want to dirty this sub with it.

With a hardware wallet you do not have to backup correct? Just as long as you have your recovery phrase?

MOON IS SOON!
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:40:14
Oh, I would rather not pay fees. I get the money to them and then transfer to GDAX(no fees). Buy BTC on limit, then transfer to my wallet(no fees)
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:01:28
Still won't break even!
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:41:40
I see this as risky. Just me. You may have a higher tolerance than I.
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:03:11
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:28:21
Is it due to bad buy in price or true humor? Inquiring minds want to know!
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:37:42
@_date: 2018-11-29 02:24:47
I think this is the first time I have bought and it actually went up in value!
@_date: 2018-03-10 05:06:57
Is that 50 cents or 50 cents to the dollar? The latter seems ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:03:28
That's an investment plan. That is what I am attempting to do now. $200/week. I am attempting to get ahead of the game a bit though, as we all are. The prevailing thought here is to put money on Coinbase and buy the dip.
I have a personal connection that is willing to sell, but I have to give hime a days notice.  
Too the moon! 
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:17:15
You cannot lose it if you HODL!
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:33:19
[Read this post]( for some info. The second reply from is very informative on fees, or how to avoid them. I still have issues with how long the ACH transfer takes from bank to Coinbase. Even though my funds have been debited from my account, I still will not have access until 3-20-18.  
Does this ever get any quicker? A week is a long time to wait.
@_date: 2017-10-17 04:19:32
PLEASE make me understand this. I am completely dumbfounded on crypto currencies as I do not see how they are valued so high. I follow bitcoin, ethereum and monero just to see how they perform, which all have been performing well as of late. I have read tutorials, gone through all of the websites that are named for these currencies and I am still skeptical. I still do not see the value like you.  
Open my eyes!  Make me see the light!

From my past experience, I am about to tank your investment by buying $200 USD of $btc
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:42:37
Here's what you peeps taught the newb for fee free bitcoin purchases on Coinbase/GDAX:
1\) Deposit money from bank account to Coinbase. This takes up to a week in my experience.
2\) Once the money is deposited, log onto GDAX. 
3\) Choose ~~Transfer~~ Deposit. In this window choose Coinbase Account
4\) Post a Limit Buy\(google this for more in depth instruction\)
5\) Once order is filled, transfer to your hardware/software wallet \(do not keep on GDAX\)
6\) HODL  
(Edit: step 3)
