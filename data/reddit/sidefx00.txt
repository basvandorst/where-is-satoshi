Following this logic, how many more bitcoins are available to mine, as they become more difficult to mine, at the current price of electricity, what would the price of mining a bitcoin be 1 year from now at the current rate of bitmining?

It will increase scarcity but on a long enough timeline the number a Bitcoins left will be 0 at some point. Imagine all the US currency that was minted in 1790, and that was all we could use and they never created anything else. The value of even a dollar would be so high it would be unusable as currency. Imagine if the current dollars value was 10 million dollars. The only thing you could ever do with it is exchanged it for different kinds of currency with smaller denominations.

If you plan get out it will be okay but there are many cases where it hasn't been planned out. People getting into car accidents and dying suddenly or just people who haven't taking the time to organize things. There will be a consistent percentage of people who died and don't have things taken care of properly.

If a bank goes bankrupt your money is not gone, there's FDIC insurance.

I won't, but some will. I'm not really looking at this from an individual perspective, I'm thinking about the long-term viability of the coin. What happens if it's getting chipped away on a regular basis after long periods of time?

I feel like this is asking more than you realize from the average joe who isn't tech savvy but wants to get into bitcoin.

Interesting, if that is possible than that would solve the problem.
