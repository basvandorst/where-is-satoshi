I haven't seen it before.  It's worth periodically reposting though, just for the comedy value - and to put into context the nonsense some people say about bitcoin being something useless that will never take off.

Where is that in the community rules?

Where do the community rules say that?  Apart from in your own head I mean. This isn't CDOLago's subreddit.

Thanks for the upvote.  Your figures are interesting, but I don't think they accurately reflect the potential benefits to a store chain of gaining the loyalty of the bitcoin community.
Here's why.
I'm a big fan of bitcoin.  I have a large slice of my savings in it. So yes, I buy and hold.  I also use bitcoin to buy things with where possible, but the options for buying things with it are still pretty limited.  So far webhosting is pretty much all I've bought with bitcoin.
I also do a weekly grocery shop.  I spend a vast amount on groceries for my household every year.  These transactions are all in fiat, because the stores I buy from don't accept bitcoin (yet).
If one of them did start accepting bitcoin, all of my grocery purchases would be made using bitcoin, which means I'd be buying a vast amount more bitcoin - buying them to then spend them every week on groceries.
So I don't think you can look at the current total value of bitcoin transactions and work out from that how much you might gain from having all the bitcoiners on your side. 
What they are currently spending on groceries is not included in the current bitcoin transactions total.

Well I laughed at it.  Just because you don't enjoy someone else's humor there's no need to be offensive

Then he said to them, “Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.”
And he told them this parable: “The ground of a certain rich man produced a good crop. He thought to himself, ‘What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.' “Then he said, ‘This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I'll say to myself, “You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.”'
“But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?'

That's a false dichotomy.  Activities with genuine utility do not fall into the classification 'gambling' - even though they may involve risk.  Name any activity that you consider to be genuine 'saving', and by applying your argument it could be proven that what you describe is gambling.
Not backing bitcoin means you are backing fiat.  Putting dollars in a savings account is a gamble that your money won't seriously depreciate through inflation.

At present this is 65% upvoted, so if this is a democratic community I don't see why this link should be deleted.

Not so, the fact that there is risk involved does not mean it is gambling.
Casino gambling is all about losing money to the house by playing games that are weighted in favour of the house winning.  Even if the game was fair, and it's 50/50 whether you win or the house, it's still random chance who wins.
Backing bitcoin is understood to be a risky but rational step to take, once you look at how the protocol works, the size of the markets it could potentially disrupt, and the value that a single bitcoin could soar to when/if it goes mainstream in those markets.

I think you're probably right that the average Walmart customer would fit the profile of the 'laggard' as far as the Bell Adoption Curve is concerned.
But I think you may be overlooking an important point.  
If your current customers don't want to use Bitcoin, that's fine. Implementing the change so your checkouts accept Bitcoin wouldn't stop your current average customers from ignoring the Bitcoin option and continuing to pay the way they do now.
But by adding the Bitcoin option you would instantly gain the loyalty of members of the Bitcoin community.
The Bitcoin community is growing, and its members (for diverse reasons) all want Bitcoin to succeed.  If they saw a major store chain start accepting Bitcoin, I think they'd all switch to that store and buy everything they could there.
Walmart has an opportunity to gain the loyalty of all those bitcoiners if it becomes the first store chain of its type to accept Bitcoin.
Accepting Bitcoin would give Walmart an opportunity to expand its customer base.
