Bitcoin mining is not nearly as profitable as lending - just because a bank is not giving you good interest doesn't mean they can't. It's more like they won't.
The mining is unnecessary. At the same time, anyone that runs a bank pretty much turns into a greedy shit once they see they can basically print money and you'll get screwed anyway.

Pro tip: anyone guaranteeing returns later in exchange for a deposit now is scamming you. No matter how careful you are, the process will *require* you to put funds in control of the scammer (in this instance they will ask you to provide the private key to 'connect' the wallet to an AntMiner which is untrue) at which point they just run away with your funds.
Alternatively they can also pre-make the wallet and share it with you (in which case they also have control).

I guess for me, this kind of prediction 'depends', on what the long term outcome is. Assuming some kind of crypto becomes the standard, will we transact natively or will we use local currencies which are traded against a global standard?
That will depend on how many of the mod cons are available natively - for example having to push every payment can be a burden for a lot of people, so having a pull system with access control backed by distributed security may help. And then you have privacy where people may have an adverse reaction to all your transactions being visible as standard.
If something (e.g. Bitcoin) evolves to the point where it can replace all the functions of intermediaries in a distributed fashion then exchanges may become a footnote long term. But I digress, as your article is actually speaking from a who's first perspective and not a longer term view. From that perspective, Coinbase may get there first indeed.

From a business perspective, it entirely depends on your target market. Especially if your target market is global, they will probably find BTC a lot easier to deal with than fiat cross border payments.
If you have both systems set up, why not let them choose? I don't see the point in going cold turkey on fiat if that means turning away users. Use multiple payout methods as a selling point.

Right - so you are talking about an uncontested hard fork, not a contested hard fork (ala large block). I don't think if it's uncontested that there will be many issues. Sure there may be some disruption but the higher level sidechain information just resumes on the new chain since people switch over quickly.

Yeah there would be a lot of resistance to doing it as it would be difficult to replicate the states of all layers. That isn't to say that it couldn't be done, the state would roll back to the latest on chain data that was available.

The real issue is that merchants don't want to actually deal with Bitcoin. They want an invisible service layer that delivers them fiat.
This isn't going to change until it's actually desirable for merchants to deal with Bitcoin natively. Then you'll see merchants run payments into their own wallet directly.

The market dominance figure is pretty useless... As the BTC price goes up, the alts get boosted which automatically reduces the market cap dominance. The reverse happens with BTC price goes down.
It has virtually no connection to any tangible measure of dominance.

If the forked chain also supports LN, you would restore your wallet that supports the new chain, and it would be a point in time snapshot of the state of that chain. If it doesn't support LN, then I can only imagine that the state would basically ignore any LN transactions that happened.
But don't go doing this willy nilly for scraps on worthless forks. You don't want to give your keys away to a dodgy wallet.

@_date: 2018-02-28 12:28:49
If you are in a country that has deprecated signatures, adopted contactless and NFC phone payments using card schemes it doesn't feel outdated IMO. 
In Australia the convenience is very competitive where almost all shops have been given contactless terminals and Apple/Android/FitBit payments are being rolled out.
Interchange margin rates are also regulated so companies aren't playing "who can make fees the most confusing" and charging huge interchange. It's pretty good. You can negotiate rates as low as 0.4% Visa/MC as a merchant if you have volume.

They have dynamic incoming addresses. When you create an exchange account it typically has no unique wallet address. You create one (and can keep generating addresses) only to identify your inwards transfers.
Once it's received it gets moved to the hot wallet, the exchange takes the hit on the fee to move it to the hot wallet.
There are some that do have a unique wallet per client but they are not nearly as common as ones with a hot wallet.

If it's the txn volume * rate, then it's actual value moving over the network regardless of what it's usage is.
