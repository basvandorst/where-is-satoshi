Source please. I have never [seen a required fee higher than $0.4/tx](
@_date: 2017-02-26 10:30:57
I have no problem with that. Bitcoin was designed this way, if you get 50% then it's fair game - for segwit and for BU. Of course people will decide which chain they're actually going to use in the end.
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:15:38


I am not defending one single action. I am defending risk management, i.e. if you own bitcoin and it suddenly is 90% of all your assets then it's probably a good idea to diversify - this way you have a higher chance of something succeeding instead of having all your eggs in one basket.


By this logic we should also play the lottery, because *just maybe* we might be 'right'. I have always believed in numbers - if the expected payoff doesn't cover the cost then it's not worth investing.

It's actually pretty easy for someone from EU, as the euro/usd was at 1.4 at the last peak and it's barely above 1 now.
@_date: 2017-02-25 08:52:04
It was a good idea at the time. Everyone saying they knew bitcoin will go to $1000 back in 2011 is full of shit. Looking back would it be better to hold? Of course. Do I regret it? Absolutely not.

As far as I know shadow copies are files just like anything else and not really under the filesystem - if the virus can get to them then they'll be encrypted.

Any coalition of over 50% can choose to activate segwit if they so desire.
@_date: 2017-02-12 15:53:58
Filesystem level (auto)snapshots, like ZFS, is the right thing to avoid these things.
@_date: 2017-02-25 08:45:40
I don't understand what you are saying. Yes, it's a good idea to transfer more risky investments into less risky ones when they reach a large percentage of your portfolio.
@_date: 2017-02-25 08:43:54
I sold to manage my risk, and I'm very far from pissed. In fact if I were to do it again I wouldn't change a thing. It amuses me how you think you know me.
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:59:50
I think it's important to set some goals before investing with what you would be happy with and then stick to them, because deciding on a whim is usually the worst. It doesn't have to be a 'sell everything or nothing' decision though.
@_date: 2017-02-25 07:24:32
Yes, we should all put everything we have into bitcoins, right? Typical bitcoin evangelist.
@_date: 2017-02-18 14:39:42


It's probably because no one from r/bitcoin gives a shit about BU.
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:39:52
I don't. I set very clear rules at which points i'm going to sell (up *and* down) and i stick with them.
@_date: 2017-02-22 11:21:33
But it's not the blocksize that determines which transactions get put into a block, it's miners incentive(s). If I make a 0 fee transactions it's unlikely to get included no matter how big blocks are. Saying bigger blocks will improve confirmation time is nonsense - using appropriate fee will. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 07:12:12
Or, you know, maybe it's properly managing risk. Then again I would think 90% of this subreddit know nothing about that.
@_date: 2017-02-25 07:38:28
Actually I got in in 2011, when the price was $0.8. I was already partially selling with profit when it was $10.

Please provide peer reviewed papers.
@_date: 2017-02-25 22:04:13
No, i saw the best picture for myself and stuck with it and i still stand by that decision. It's hilarious how people here are trying to convince me that i should somehow regret what i did.
It's also funny how my 'disastrous strategy' has made me more money than i will ever make by working hard.
@_date: 2017-02-22 08:56:14


The reason is simple: fee is too low.
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:37:54
Sure buddy.
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:13:00


They absolutely can and noone can prevent them. What you end up with is two different chains with different hashrates, one might have a higher hashrate but if the exchanges don't accept coins from it what good does that do them?
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:41:51


I wouldn't count gold as a safe investment. Sure it's held it's value over thousands of years but day to day, month to month it's just as much a speculative investment as bitcoin is.

He can't because he wouldn't get the support needed - the only way is exploiting the support core has and force them to do it for him.

I am here precisely because r/bitcoin is moderated - because they deal with all the bullshit for me.

When something is worth considering I'll be aware of it even on this sub.
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:14:27


It's not. It's because if there is a fork and core is left with less than 50% of hashing power there is a high chance the other 50% will try everything in their power to cause problems including attacking it - so basically there is no other option.
And let's be real here, mining has become so centralized a POW change really is the obvious choice.
@_date: 2017-02-28 09:10:30
Putting all your eggs into one basket is a terrible idea.
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:44:32


Why would it? This is all just speculation.
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:51:21
I stopped checking r/btc because all the top threads were about how shitty r/bitcoin is. This sub is slowly becoming just like them with all of these threads.
All these accusations are just like their accusations of core people being paid by blockstream. If we want to be better we need to stop with this drama circlejerk.
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:36:30


I for one don't trust people's beliefs. I trust in well thought out and fully tested code.
I do not believe that if an entity had 70% of hashing power they would attack the network (because it's will cause a drop in their revenue). Is it smart to allow that? No, it's dangerous.
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:22:51

Completely normal, it was included in the first block after broadcast. Time is not the right metric to use for how quickly transactions are confirmed, blocks after broadcast are.

I don't think we can count on segwit at this point, as sad as that is. We should think how we can roll LN out without segwit/a malleability fix, if that is possible.
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:08:05
As bitcoin currently is, for every transaction that is broadcasted and contains a signature I can create another transaction that will be different but essentially do the same thing. If I broadcast this as soon as the original transaction hits the network the miners might include my transaction in a block instead of the original one, which will confuse people expecting the original transaction to be confirmed.
@_date: 2017-03-02 09:33:43
If 10k is all your savings then it's a terrible idea. You should have at least 6 months worth of paycheck in safe investments.
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:14:09
(I would think) you can probably mitigate a lot of that in making an algorithm that isn't cpu intensive but i/o intensive. Sure a custom circuit is still going to be faster but since the majority of the time is stuck at the i/o the difference won't be so large.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:40:58
The last time I raised this problem they quoted me this from their wiki:


with a "so, not a problem" addition.
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:08:26
It still requires a malleability fix to work as it should and we're probably not getting that anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:59:44


If this were correct then the blocks would be 25% full, as you say. They are [all completely full](
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:37:20


Ugh. Those are very, very different, incomparable options.
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:20:25
No, it's more like not watching FOX news because most of it is bullshit. As for what is best for bitcoin I can decide by myself, I don't need any subreddit to put their own ideas into my mind.

Correct, I haven't thought of that.
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:12:16
I don't think anyone is actually against a floating block size if it can be done securely. The problem is as of now there are [very simple exploits]( of which behaviour is hard to predict and even harder to prevent.

Sure you can do that, but access to memory is really expensive. Would the speedup asics give you really make that much difference, percentage-wise?

In the lightning network the funding transaction will have a fee as well as the transaction that closes the channel - because they are regular bitcoin on-chain transactions. Everything in between should be free. Having hundreds of small transactions like in the op's case will require a fairly small fee.

When power returns all is back to as it was - this is a temporary state, ergo variance.
@_date: 2017-04-17 17:51:20
Except Tesla. Tesla goes up with no reason whatsoever. :)
@_date: 2017-04-15 20:34:15
Correct about what, other bitcoin nodes slowing the propagation? Because having only a handful of mining nodes would definitely be bad for block propagation.
@_date: 2017-04-10 05:43:50


I would say anything that is a temporary state consists variance. If actual core miners switched to BU or vice versa than that would not be variance.


I have not downvoted you.

Yup, what's the problem with that?
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:14:10
Then you should maybe change the wallet with one that does. Electrum has a preview button for every transaction telling you exactly how much fee you're going to pay.

He himself deleted that post because he had no proof. I'm sure people are going to say that he has been paid to delete it but still - no proof.

It's beyond funny that you went through my history to find this. It seems that you are accusing me of shilling for BU, but I have always been a very vocal supporter of core - seems like you have missed that.
@_date: 2017-04-08 17:22:06
Ah, then I don't know. This is mostly the reason why I stay away from this subreddit on the phone, because every time there's a significant price rise/drop it's nothing but spam.
@_date: 2017-04-15 20:57:02
I'm pretty sure that is a very simplistic view but I'm willing to look into it if you have any papers that prove that.
It all depends on how much connectivity you have between your nodes, if you have 10 nodes connected in a single line the delay from first to last will probably be larger than if you have a bunch of more connected nodes.
@_date: 2017-04-28 15:13:59
wth does that have to do with anything?
@_date: 2017-04-09 10:25:31


This is a (big) part of fixing transaction malleability.
@_date: 2017-04-15 21:33:06


Naturally, but you don't have direct links between all the parties. I don't know about the math and am currently not in a state to figure it out but I would think that adding a new node possibly creates shorter paths for some pairs of nodes than existed before.

@_date: 2017-04-10 11:56:49
I never vandalized bitcoin. Doing so would be stupid because bitcoin is a larger percentage of my net worth than most people would be comfortable with.
If anything, I "vandalized" someone's bitcoin logo on I used my pixel to put it where I thought was most suitable, and because I don't think we need to shove bitcoin down other people's throats that was a black pixel over a bitcoin logo.
Props for the axe quotes though.
@_date: 2017-04-09 20:22:58
So it's variance? :)
@_date: 2017-04-10 05:53:38

The answer to  Dear god.
@_date: 2017-04-10 09:13:15
[It's back to as it was]( now. Whatever the reason was it didn't matter at all. I call this variance - the only way this isn't variance is when BU miners start switching to core or vice versa.
@_date: 2017-04-10 05:59:46
Rofl. Sure I pruned my history. This is exactly the behavior on I'm talking about.


No, there weren't. I just woke up 20 minutes ago. I'll pay you a beer if you can prove that.

Have to admit I don't get that one.
@_date: 2017-04-09 09:40:32
I have been paying with bitcoin in the beer shop over here since the first day they started accepting it. It's just as quick as using a bank card, if not quicker.
@_date: 2017-04-06 18:28:17


Is there actually any proof they are being paid? I'm genuinely curious, because otherwise such statement are the same bullshit as them saying blockstream is influencing core.
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:10:06
Just use [RES]( and create filters. I did that for everything containing every currency imaginable and now I don't see a single spammy post about the price anymore.
@_date: 2017-04-09 20:54:02
Proof? Comments like these sound just like stuff on @_date: 2017-04-11 08:52:09
No, it's exactly the opposite - signatures are included in the hashing that gives you the transaction id, but signatures themselves are malleable. I can take any transaction and create another transaction with different (but still valid) signatures that will give me a different transaction id.
@_date: 2017-04-09 20:27:15
Possible yes, but not easy to do. As long as the signatures are a part of transaction hash there is going to be malleability unless:
- you change the hash to exclude signatures, which is what segwit does, as I understand it
- you force signatures to be a certain way, like a specific DER encoding (bip 66) and allowing only low s-numbers (which hasn't been done yet)
Note that segwit as a soft fork still stores signatures in the transactions. To store that separately we would need a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-04-10 10:01:41
I don't understand what you mean by that.
@_date: 2017-04-10 07:28:45
Don't know, it's up to you. You're the one throwing around accusations. Maybe try [this](
You do see how this is just like calling people paid shills? Nobody has any proof yet people still keep doing it.
@_date: 2017-04-05 10:57:03


It's actually squashing everything into one small transaction per opened channel that is then mined like a regular on-chain bitcoin transaction.
@_date: 2017-04-10 10:24:10
Vandalizing bitcoin? What are you talking about.
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:35:53
I would argue that power almost always comes back - [as did in this case, it seems](
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:03:05
It's ridiculous that you need to first fund the localbitcoins wallet before you can even contact anyone.
@_date: 2017-04-10 05:45:31
How can I do what? I have not seen a shred of evidence that anyone is being paid. accusing blockstream developers of influencing core's direction is the sole reason I stay away from it, and posts like this are exactly the same. This is basically dropping on level.
@_date: 2017-04-09 17:49:29
It's variance. Is this so difficult to grasp?
@_date: 2017-05-13 06:51:36
