Thank you for the replies and happy cake day.

Oh, that's a bummer. I understand that bitcoin is an open protocol, but I guess I can understand why a forum would need to control the message.
I'm sure the mods have the best interest of the community at heart.

Yeah I guess it is tough, gotta find a balance somewhere.
What are the other subs? I found one that seemed okay, can I mention it here? Are there others?
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:48:19
That seems like a long time. Why not just a few hours or something like that?

Thank you for your replies and happy cake day.
I'm trying to respond to your lower level comment ([ but my comments keep vanishing.

Yes, I think it involves manually broadcasting a new raw transaction that spends the same outputs from the transaction that is stuck, but includes a higher fee. I'm not really familiar with this.
Maybe you can figure out how to do it before I do lol.

I just pulled up my Bitcoin Core 11.2 in Windows.
When you're in the "Send" tab, there's a "**Transaction Fee:**" section at the bottom.
Click the "Choose..." box in that section and you can adjust the fee in absolute or per KB terms. It also has a "Recommended" per KB slider that's based on the number of blocks you would like your transaction to confirm within.
EDIT: typo

Why does it say [amount hidden] on the theme?
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:04:52
Once you transfer bitcoin out of Coinbase, Coinbase has no control over that bitcoin. In this case, whoever has access to the Electrum wallet you mention would be able to spend that bitcoin.
However, it's pretty much guaranteed that Coinbase will forever keep a record of that transaction in their databases, with your name and personal information tied to it. Act accordingly.

[Executive Order 6102](


[Gold Reserve Act](




I see no reason why the United States or another government would not attempt to do something like this again if Bitcoin were to become enough of a threat.
EDIT for extra info: Ford made it legal to have gold again in the mid-1970s, but only after Nixon ended the official gold standard in 1971.
EDIT 2: why are all the scores hidden?
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:54:29
Not sure if sarcastic or not, so...


They devalued the dollar by nearly 50% after forcing everyone to exchange their gold for dollars.
Granted, it'd be interesting to see the government try to pull a stunt like that today, with gold or bitcoin or anything.

Thank you for the replies and happy cake day.
I think mentioning other bitcoin-centric parts of reddit autoshadowbans your post.
I mentioned 'romeo slash bravo tango charlie' and my post disappears when I log out.
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:19:26
I suspect things will get messy. Hopefully not violent.
EDIT: what's up with all the hidden scores?
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:42:13
Only in areas where they can profit/benefit highly. As bitcoin becomes more wide spread more people will take that risk as bitcoin becomes more profitable/beneficial.
Assuming a government were to ban the use of bitcoin in the first place.
EDIT: why can't I see scores?
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:19:26
Ohhh that makes sense I guess.
Now that you mention it I have noticed it on other subs. But don't some of them have a time limit when eventually you can see the scores?
