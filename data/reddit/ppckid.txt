I was the same way when I was a younger kid.  You don't think about these things as you're just trying to get rich quick and don't understand why taxes are even a thing.  
It's kind of like being a kid and being mad that TV stations have commercials.  Lol
When you have nothing to lose is when you don't think straight and try to pull off stupid shit.

We did that for our rights to play poker online with the rest of the world.
We can no longer play poker online with the rest of the world.

I have no clue what I'm doing so I figure I'm just going to pay the maximum amount possible to be safe.
I put in 12k this year.  Cashed out the 12k and left all profits online.  I then cashed out $5k in profit a few months back.  
I'm just going to tell my accountant to pay the max.  I've held it less than a year and it's all profit.

It's Reddit.  I feel like getting up voted is like the same odds as winning the Power Ball.
I'm an old poker pro who lived thru the DOJ coming after our industry back in 2009.  The horror stories me and my buddies went thru was an eye opening experience.  
Do NOT fuck around if you don't have too.  I'm happy as hell to pay the maximum possible amount of taxes to avoid any questions whatsoever.

Considering $5k means nothing to me 100%.  Not worth getting put on the do not fly list for not paying taxes for such a hot assett at the moment lol

I'm so fascinated to find out how unstable this bull market is at this point. 
So much blind dead money coming in so fast.

Blind adoption.  Absolutely no one knows what Bitcoin actually is or ever has plans to use Bitcoin.  They also want FAST gains.  
This is an insane bull market.
One wrong tweet from Donny and there could be a massive tremor.  One things awesome about Bitcoin though, it's recovered every single time.

The underlying code is impossible to hack.  Wallets are easily cracked and it's bananas finding an ACH transfer is harder than transferring crypto.

Except it's ridiculously hard to use, so easily hacked, and 100x more corrupt than fiat

Lol yeah...because Bitcoin is so much more reliable and stable than the dollar lol
