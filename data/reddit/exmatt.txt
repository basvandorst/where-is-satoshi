Yes, but if someone was to add a lot of hashrate to the network now, at the current difficulty, and then withdraw it once the difficulty changes, could that cause network problems?

I was there, it's a little sad, what you're seeing in the picture is the booth for Kcoin at the Inside Bitcoin convention in Seoul that's going on right now.
Kcoin is a scammy altcoin with a centralized ledger based on bitcoin, but with only 1 node, run by the company. It has a real MLM feel, complete with a charismatic CEO with bodyguards. A rep told me that I could earn a bonus if I get others to buy Kcoin! But the rest of the convention was awesome.
@_date: 2015-12-11 00:57:47
no u/BlockchainMan I mean Amway style bonuses paid... if you get in on Kcoin now, everyone you refer gets you a bonus, and then people THEY refer get you a bonus. Imagine a pyramid. If you get in on Kcoin now, you can be at the TOP OF THE PYRAMID. It's a once in a lifetime proposition, apparently.

Segregated Witness is *far* from ready for PR to core. Many problems. Blocksize to 2mb is as easy as: 
MAX_BLOCK_SIZE=2000000 
3.5 transactions per second is NOT enough. The mempool is clogged. As we try to reach consensus, this is an easy enough solution. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:36:08
the big players pay attention to their clients. hell, we know who they are, we can call them directly and tell them. raising MAX_BLOCK_SIZE  to 2 million is uncontroversial and easy to implement. **There is consensus on this.** Someone with commit access should merge to core ASAP.

That's the first I've heard.. do you have a reference? If you don't think the approaching 3.5/sec transaction limit is an emergency... I don't think you understand what the terms "scaling" and "adoption" mean.

As it stands now, most hash power is in China. Because small blocksize lets them take advantage of cheap electricity in high latency, walled-gardenish, low bandwidth environment. *This is unnatural and unhealthy, and an unintended consequence of an anti-spam measure.* Having most of the hash power reside in China is a bigger threat to bitcoin than raising the blocksize to levels that can handle scaling. 
Does raising the blocksize mean less nodes will be run out of China, *in the short term*? 
Yes, probably. 
Will raising the blocksize (along with SW, LN, pruning and other efforts to improve the network), in the medium and long term, help bitcoin gain in popularity and **give people and businesses in the free world reason to run a small node?** Yes, for sure, imho. And that is what this debate is about.
Edit: because on mobile.
@_date: 2015-12-28 01:24:42
I'm operating a "small node". Raising the blocksize might mean I need to upgrade my 500gb hard drive in 5 years. I'm okay with that, and it won't "push me out". 
Not raising the blocksize is a subsidy to places with substandard internet.

If you look at the data, only 21% of respondents want the status quo. It's pretty clear who is doing the spreading. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:20:05


If you drill down into the stats, it is clear that most people voted for a blocksize increase of some sort (with or without SW) so the statement: 


seems to be the most distort-y thing I've read here.
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:53:26


well **21%**(1MB+SW) +**26%** (2MB+SW) = **47%**
If you could explain how 47% is a vast majority, that would be great.
I always assumed a majority requires more than 50%, but I guess you know math better than me.

Localbitcoins isn't all that bad.
One thing to consider is margins. Let's say gold is trading for $40/g. 
If I walk into a jeweler or gold dealer, he will probably sell me that gold for $50, and that's a standard business practice. Many people will buy gold like that, with those margins.
To translate that into bitcoin terms, if the price of bitcoin on coinbase is $400, you can bet that you'll find bitcoin on localbitcoins for less than $500. I offer about 2% over coinbase on some of my ads, especially when I need cash. You can negotiate with people on localbitcoins, remember.

same here, I do about 20 BTC a day in lots of txs, no problem paying fees, although size of mempool is troubling. I hope we can quickly look at short term scaling solutions, and pick something that is relatively simple and easy to implement. SegWit doesn't meet those criteria from my standpoint. In addition, 85+% of my txs would not see much difference in how they are handled as I understand it. So I'm not sure how much benefit SegWit will offer to reducing mempool until and unless the way transactions are signed changes.
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:06:40
What are you talking about???
One of the options was 21% the other was 26% 
21 + 26 = 47
**47% is not now, nor will it ever be a vast majority**
(It's slightly less than half)

Set up an account on localbitcoins and place a free ad. Set your price to slightly lower than spot. You will immediately stand out among sellers there, since everyone does arbitrage on that site. 
You will have the lowest price, since you're not trying to arbitrage. 
Unless you live in the sticks people will travel to give you money for your (relatively) cheap bitcoin.

Oh I know all about that, and as long as it allows one to change the outputs, it's a horrible idea.

Each node/miner has its own policy, that's not a consensus thing, but in my experience, 72 hours should be enough.

**for the time being, until it gets rejected out of the mempool in a few days**


**What wallet are you using? most wallets calculate this automatically. If for some reason you can't use a modern wallet, 0.0002 BTC should usually be enough, if it's a non-exotic, few inputs and outputs and a small size transaction. But its a better idea just to go on google and find yourself a better wallet.**

RBF is fine if it maintains first seen safe by using child pays for parent. 
Otherwise, its one of the worst pull requests in the history of github. We don't need the kind of higgery-pokery that is RBF that's seemingly designed to make double spend simple enough for an actual 5 year old.
@_date: 2016-02-19 03:02:06
I do understand. 
The problem is with the proverbial cup of coffee. Accepting 0-conf is like in the old days when people accepted checks. Its worth is, despite risk of fraud, because 99.99% of people aren't fraudsters. As it stands without this strange implementation of rbf where one can arbitrarily change outputs, it is difficult (although not impossible) to double spend, because of general rule first seen safe. 
RBF as proposed (eventually non-opt-in) blows this out of the water, and eliminates a major usecase of bitcoin. 
Getting merchants to understand bitcoin is hard enough, getting them to understand they have to reject transactions based on an obscure flag in the transaction output is beyond ridiculous and will do great harm to the popularity of bitcoin among merchants.
Tl;dr: 
RBF without CPFP blows FSS out of the water and that's a bad idea. There shouldn't be a way to easily change the payee after you paid. If you foolishly don't include  a resonable fee, a fair punishment is to wait till its out of the mempool. There is no reason to change the system to help foolish and/or fraudulent behavior.

What? anyone who uses bitcoin on a day-to-day basis (like me and lots of other r/btc people) doesn't like paying huge fees. Removing the *temporary* 1MB limit that was only intended to be there until SPV was available is the clearest solution to me. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:49:32
but bitmain and avalon are the only ones actively doing POW. So yeah, at this point we do need them. If there is a company offering POW that I don't know about, let me know, but otherwise, I don't know how to build an ASIC myself, and Antminers are pretty much my top option.  
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:40:10
Obviously there is a disagreement about whether the first and second  variants lived up to the agreement. The 'other side' is asserting that the first and second(?) proposals did not live up to the agreement. The third was a rude joke. 
Furthermore, the 'other side' is incentivized to simply increase capacity. 
luke was incentivized to increase capacity in such a way as to make LN/2nd layer solutions a profitable business model. 
Therefore, to an outside observer, I am inclined to believe the side that is simply incentivized to increase capacity. I see no reason why someone incentivized to help a private business should be believed over someone without such conflicts.
edit: sauce on 2nd proposal? also, if as you claim, the first proposal was good enough, why did luke go ahead and make another? and another, that was obviously problematic, and a non-starter.
EDIT: I was banned for calling out BS in this sub. If you're reading this, you're only getting one side of the argument. Lot's of people on the other side aren't allow to speak here.

the key is "set up a relationship"
Many traders, once they get over 100 confirmed trades, do most of their business *outside* the localbitcoins 1% escrow service. People trust them because they have a reputation, and are happy to save the premium. So if you find someone reputable on there and ask, they might be able to help without the crazy premium. 
A lot of it depends on where you/your customers are, some places are a lot more competitive, rate wise than others. If you're in the bay area, for example, you can pay pretty close to market rate, or even better, if the trader you're dealing with has too much bitcoin and needs cash. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:35:39


Yes, they are actively spending a fortune on ASIC development. We can argue about what constitutes "good will", but at the end of the day, they are putting their money where their mouth is in a provable way, thanks to POW.

no, its double sha256, like I said. While brute forcing sha256 *might* be on the mid-term horizon, I don't know anyone who thinks double sha256 is in the same boat.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:42:35


double sha256 is *the* defining feature of bitcoin. Billions of dollars have been spent on machines that can only do double sha256. 
The ledger is secured by a bunch of machines that do double sha256. Turning them into space heaters can only reduce the security of bitcoin.

IMO, this is a primarily a subreddit for the protocol itself as well as new and innovative uses for bitcoin. Sadly, in a field of nearly 20, there are only two 2016 presidential candidates not taking money from the quazi-legitimate superpacs funded by the same banks trying to kill bitcoin. 
Unfortunately, one of those two candidates is named Donald Trump. 
I feel getting money to the only candidate who has not been purchased by the big banks or thrived as a  reality TV star is a novel use.

I've never been to Uganda, but I have been to many third world countries, and I can confirm that whatever isn't bolted down and protected with armed guards is stolen. 
I think other posters are overlooking the fact that labor is incredibly cheap in places like Uganda. So it might be cheaper and more sustainable to invest in human capital rather than something like an ATM.
If I were trying to do this, I would invest in a worker who would act as a kind of bank teller, handling payments. 
Ugandans are not for the most part particularly tech-savvy, newbs to bitcoin often need hand-holding their first transactions, something a trained employee could do. 
You might have to hire someone to protect him/her, but that would only be while the office was open, not 24/7. 
For example, in the third world country where I'm in at the moment, labor is so cheap that when one wants something like a bill of sale for a vehicle, they go to an business where someone types up the bill of sale on an old school typewriter (although dot-matrix is starting to become in vogue.
And also, by creating an opportunity for a decent paying (by Ugandan standards) job, you are helping the Ugandan economy more than shipping a hunk of metal would. 
One way to go might be to train someone like a shopkeeper, who just sits around all day anyway, so could handle people coming to his/her shop to buy/sell bitcoin. AND that person might already have security in place, so more savings.
