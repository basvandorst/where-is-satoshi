Because Satoshi Nakamoto was into crypto (no shit right?) - the name itself could be a encrypted sentence, or an anagram?

Bitcoin can't be charted this way. Bitcoin is not paired with usd. Bitcoin is paired with amount of holders (that hold over a certain satoshi-level). More holders, or more spreading = should give higher chart. BTC/USD pair makes it really twisted, because it doesn't not say anything about the amount of holders. I suppose some people that went in early 2017, also went in with huge sum of dollars, then cashed out. (I wonder how the real chart looks like when counting amount of holders 2017, and amount of holders 2019 - that has more than 100.000 satoshi).

This mean bitcoin-mining is resulting in more miner-devices and double electricity-cost for going with the same profit as before?  
And it can mean the smaller miner-companies give up, while the bigger ones get stronger?

then copy  &amp; import it in some other modern wallet.
