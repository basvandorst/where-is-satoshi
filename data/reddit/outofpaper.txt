It looks quite interesting where did you find it and do you have a link to the original file?

I too want to be able to contact this supposed law firm directly rather than give info to someone that is collecting it for them.

 I've worked with them before. They where reliable and had a very fast turn about.

A quick how to your computer has a file called hosts on it.
Adding the folowing  will give you access until the manager of bitcoinity fixes things: 
176.9.88.14     bitcoinity.org
 it on it's own line.
 people that are new to dealing with their hosts file look over this  site 
They provide fairly detailed info. Also they have a hosts file that will bock most 3dparty advertisers.

Bitcoin's value comes from its use. All the people who are jumping on and off of it for a quick buck don't help its real value. Ether spend it and buy some more or build something that works with  with it.

What electronic transfers do you currently have access to?
@_date: 2013-03-19 10:51:04
So long as your service never touches fiat currency you are currently seen as just doing things with play money.

Warning.  The site that created it looks like an online education spam site.

While it's easy to say things like that, this is a good example of a very small business that can benefit from bitcoin. They don't need to setup a merchant account or risk their paypal account being frozen for some obscure rule violation or one a paypal admin whim. If they take the resources that would have been spent on transaction fees and invest them into branding and their own site all the better.
