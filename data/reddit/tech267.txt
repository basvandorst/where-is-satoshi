I dont think it has anything to do with bitcoin. Probably they are looking into building a Smart Contracts using their own blockchain.
Also, I think he is only pointing at the bitcoin's benefit while mentioning about banking the 3.2 billion people. I dont think he has a better solution.

I can see only two listings, one full time and the other contract for a startup.

Applying bitcoin filter in Angelist.co also provides a good list with the funding info.

Thanks for your response. Why is Celery better than Coinbase or Bitpay for BTC-to-USD conversion?

Amadeus, SABRE, etc make a lot of money by charging for the GDS (Global Distribution Systems) which is a centralized database for Airline availability and booking. It can be disrupted with blockchain to be much more efficient. However, it is not easy, as they are huge, still use very old systems (technologically) and highly dependent by the travel management companies and airlines. We might need a whole new Satoshi to disrupt this industry.
