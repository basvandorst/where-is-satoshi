This is way over my head, but I sure get the feeling this is important. Quick question  : If  developers can or do decide to make  decisions that have  large monetary impacts,  is there any recourse for insider information being used for ones personal gain? As in if I was part of the select few who are growing / designing / whatever the core infrastructure as this gets bigger or as it sounds "in your shoes" and you knew something like this was coming in an hour and decided to buy big or dump just prior? Hope that made sense.  Fell free to go back talking way over my head.

Anyone know the profit made from an average ATM ?

Didn't want to cloud the thread with Thank you!  , But thank you ! Very insightful. 
I think if more of the population knew these sort of facts they would embrace the currency rather than of resit it.  I am under the impression from speaking with peers that Bitcoin is too "high tech" and dark for them to understand so they don't bother. As a general rule IMO  people are afraid of what they don't know so they believe it to be a bad thing and will intentionally not accept it and ignore it until those with power (Gov / Fed figures I presume)  tell them it is safe.  Unfortunately I believe those who will or do have the power to implement it and legitimize will not do so until they already own most of it ...

I get that the blockchain doesn't sell anything. But this confuses me now. If you can purchase bitcoin or trade for it or however without the knowledge of the blockchain then isn't the price just a guess or rough estimate of how many bitcoins actually exist ?

Will ask it again. because it gets to more of my curiosity.  If you can make a purchase without the blockchain (I know they do not sell) , how would anyone ever know that they were buying the last one  ?

You make it sound like like I should know but I don't.
