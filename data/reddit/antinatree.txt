Ah well the little sacrifices for such a big change and....unsubscribe
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:11:00
It could be an option coinstar could add a camera or print one only problem is a camera is new hardware I believe they print out articles codes already so making a wallet is pretty convenient
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:05:59
Well this is really just trying to get the discussion rolling and get people to help me contact coinstar I am planning on getting the ceo email and the president to send them this petition and the benefit for coinstar is they become an investment machine a currency exchange and drives new traffic to themselves lets see it makes their machines future proof especially if bitcoin is the future
@_date: 2014-01-11 18:33:53
Link and instead of just stating problems lets hash it out for Coinstar that way they can figure it out and this way we I or you can give people the reason why rather then a nope blah blah general answer
@_date: 2014-01-11 13:59:53
Well we have bitcoin atms just saying it could happen it's just Coinstar s choice if they want to take the chance non something that will happen now or later cause if they don't do I will
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:40:29
Well I have electrical engineering associates degree and gonna start up my mechanical engineering classes next semester so I have some experience but not to the point of making a bot to pay things out
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:07:27
Well they don't charge sorting fees to PayPal or to exchange for gift cards although those companies are probably paying those fees
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:26:04
Not sure technically if you think about usd to PayPal is like paypal cash not really usd
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:56:29
Hey  I have tweeted at Coinstar , Coinstar uk, bitpay, Coinbase and a lot Bitcoin news services Coinstar responded with they will pass it on we need to bring more buzz to this and spread the petition on every forum that has bitcoin
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:06:41
Age 22 bank at pnc work at Wal-Mart pay Bills car insurance gas car and cell bill i am lucky enough to be living with girlfriends family while going to college so I pay family tax for pickup items for convenience at Wal-Mart any other questions? 
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:08:57
Uh I wasn't aware and cause mobile is all ib got
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:14:45
I am officially trying to make a difference? 
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:21:42
Well sometimes there is an inconvenience and one needs to talk to someone or go into a branch just peace of mind and my bank Is great just doesn't have a coin machine unless I roll it myself
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:26:52
Or we should make bitcoin so available it can be lended like the banks are doing
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:19:51
True it is a farfetched idea but bitcoin lacks infrastructure and infrastructure is what coinstar is anything pushing such things helps get the name out there on the news and everything so what's the harm in trying if we fail all we did is waste a little time
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:14:51
 so lets try a petition
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:10:55
     here you go now is the time to sign any feedback will be noted
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:08:24
Most places of business try to take care of their customers fast and frown upon it and some businesses will refuse to take tons of coin
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:15:43
I was hoping to bring inspiration and hope not depression and drinking
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:30:22
More business related imo
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:29:49
Well all good someone willing to try to make a difference is worth a thousand naysayers
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:15:02
Is there a better website? 
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:03:00
You lucky I have to wrap my coins for my bank then there is free like things in other banks but they have horrible accounts ..it's a mess
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:56:47
If you have any suggestions on the petition here is the link to the page that has a discussion of what info should be used any feedback is appreciated. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:24:43
True but it can't hurt to try and you can send money to PayPal which I believe you can sort of exchange any way
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:17:29
But it's accessible everywhere and for someone starting out it is an easy way to play and mess with such a thing you know how long it takes me to get $0.23 from a faucet?
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:18:29
I am planning on hitting up the ceo then president I'll look into the who is in charge of the different country branches and send them an email first thing first more signatures and fleshing out the petition 
@_date: 2014-01-07 14:58:35
They have updated it when they needed to put gift cards on there PayPal and charities so why not bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:50:50
I am fully aware and you know that's money for businesses that have coinstar in it and money for coinstar and increased advertisement
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:00:40
Sign up and show your support and maybe it will become a reality
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:16:57
Ok haha
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:02:58
Plus $10 in rolls plus minimum wage of 7.45 an hour plus exchange time where as oh i have a  bunch I am going to the grocery store so dump instant money but this is besides the point we are going for oh change dump bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:10:48
     here you go now is the time to sign any feedback will be noted
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:51:39
The closest is 20-30 miles away and has no online features I enjoy pnc they are every where have great online features and little to no fees
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:43:22
Much appreciated
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:24:39
Well you all reinforced me to make a movement other wise it would have been a post that would have been buried and any suggestions to add on the writing of the petition cause I suck at writing if you can't tell by my formatting and ands
@_date: 2014-01-07 14:56:03
Btw you got to pay for rolls and that costs money and those who work a lot spending time rolling is not exactly convenient I value my free time my family dumped 700 + dollar s worth of change in one of these the other week you know how much rolls and time I would have to invest?
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:13:26
Isn't that a white house petition website rather than change website if not let me know
@_date: 2014-01-11 17:28:12
Fees and more than likely it won't be state or local it will only be federal laws
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:26:33
Well it's the cost of business and there is almost always a fee if not a fee a ripoff cause of whatever the price or cost of coin is less than or more than average so almost no there is always a winner and loser
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:17:41
9.9 percent here they exchange for PayPal for free maybe we can get the percentage lower
@_date: 2014-01-07 14:59:19
Pennies our copper. ...so 100,000
@_date: 2014-01-11 18:17:29
Don't get me wrong idk much but the only regulation I know of is adhering to anti money laundering law which is federal a quick search hasn't yielded much other information um but that's beside the point is to show interest that way the companies know that there is interest and as we all know in the U.S. if the companies in the U.S. don't support it nothing changes
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:50:27
Changed it a little bit
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:17:57
I'd hope but doubt that they would since they don't charge paypal anything they won't charge someplace like coinbase anything. .just the value may be taking a slower time to update at some places

Wow yours is 10.9 ours in Delaware is 9.9
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:40:49
Please do! We need to put this community  to work petitioning large companies and whatnot we got to push and make things happen rather than waiting and hoping things happen
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:24:15
Here is a link to Coinstars past interest 
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:09:03
When I had the idea I searched the subreddit for like minded people and posted on the thread of other people's but yours was to old it said I should probably message all the other people and I guess great  minds think a like and no one did anything about it so I did
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:19:23
According to wiki there is coins tar in UK Ireland us and canada
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:53:29
I tweeted to Coinstar UK no response from them but  Coinstar said they would pass on the feedback
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:48:28
I think I will be quoting some of this in the petition literature
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:23:01
And if you ever used a coinstar they cut your money anyway $.09 they keep on every dollar
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:01:26
Anyone  know of a good petition website ?
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:02:46
Then we can buy movies with bitcoin. ..
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:27:13
This is beside the point the reason we are all here is getting them to exchange change to bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:38:04
Still works although momentum has slowed down alot
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:21:12
Well it would be best for them to partner
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:13:22
Yeah I will keep updating the petition today i am researching the benefits for Coinstar and will update tonight
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:27:46
I wish 
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:26:57
I know right
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:55:10
True but one has to try and they are the first person to exchange change to gift cards or to PayPal
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:37:53
We are at 200 signatures let's try to hit 500 by tomorrow guys (and gals..)
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:24:23
It isn't with that attitude! I believe bitcoin is the future if it is they are getting a jump on every one any jump in traffic is more than nothing and I think if its an exchange I'll converting my money as much as I can and pay pal is on there gift cards are on there granted they are major companies so internet is probably on there somehow and if not it can print out a paper wallet if it wants and you can go online and consolidate it to your personal wallet
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:33:46
It is to show backing really to actually see if there is an interest second got to start some where and third next thing we do is email the CEO and president of the company 
@_date: 2014-01-29 04:51:18
Printed bills real money. ..no real value  other than a government backing it
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:12:14
Mah mah what should I change someone has to start somewhere and no don't see you doing something that could grow the community
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:54:34
I would have definitely thrown my spare change in coinstar rather than spend like two months making like .00053 btc
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:11:30
I would love to but my other major goal is to destroy isp monopolies and lack of upgrades and invest or start  a successful  chain of internet cafe all while pursuing my education and getting a job to NASA doing aerospace engineering
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:56:20
Off the cuff the big banks certainly ran away with all that money from that bail out without any problems despite all the regulation and everyone sort of knew gox was trash but didn't withdrawal in time
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:57:16
Also time especially if you have a lot 
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:13:39
 Let's try a petition
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:51:34
One can send change to a PayPal account get gift cards and donate to charities and normally for no fees so I don't see why they aren't and it would be real nice to send my money to coinbase from coinstar or to my other wallets
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:21:15
I believe someone linked in a past thread that bitcoin is interested just now we got to push them to show that our community is interested. ..and hmm it would change there business model. .dang..still worth a try and yes it would be best if we could petition the government but we know how that will change so why don't you start a petition to change the government ?
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:50:45
Coinstar is where a little kiosk similar to an atm machine but instead of  for a bank coinstar allows you to dump all your spare change in it and for a small fee 9.9 percent of a dollar in Delaware you can cash it out or some of the new features is you can exchange your change to paypal or gift cards with out a fee so its a convenient coin changer 
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:15:51
Some businesses refuse you bringing in 20,000 pennies in to buy dog food and you save yourself embarrassment of counting pennies and if you roll the coin and give it to the bank you may waste that much money in time and rolls to exchange all that change
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:59:35
Sign it then lol
