Read my post, and try to take in the words...I said bitcoin isn’t replacing fiat...it’s just a means to make transactions over the internet with out using a bank.
But people like you are ignorant and like to attack...it’s okay you have a weak mind
I use one state to show adoption of the option because you apparently believe America is so perfect...so I had to stroke your patriot obsession 
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:47:39
I believe the intention of bitcoin is not to replace fiat, but essentially give another means to currency. As well as competition to central banks.
Fiat is essentially a physical form of rules and regulations as well as contract between two individuals secure by a central bank with a note that has a specific value of time to service  or product as well as an individual number of circulation that eventually expires and is burnt.
Bitcoin duplicated these rules regulations and contracts on a digital form. all the rules and regulations are public to anyone to see and change and if you can get enough followers on the new rules and regulations then you create a new network...bitcoin also gives value to time via a divisible integer assigned to a specific address which is a combination of letters and numbers specific to a decimal point of a bitcoin block. Which in turn can be exchanged over the internet for a good or service as a dollar can be exchange physically over a good or service.
The beauty of bitcoin it’s self governance system, which records all digital actions within its own protocol, essentially acting as a bank, with out using a bank to keep track of every address assigned to every divisible 21 million bitcoin block. This mimics the action of not double spending.
Essentially bitcoins gives a means to a digital world where we don’t have to use other currencies when transacting over the internet rather doing over a single currency recorded on a digital ledger. (Or digital AI bank without being a bank)

It’s not a crystal ball, it’s technical analysis.
We are currently in a bull rally, it will go down and test 9600. 
considering, news, shorts, longs and volumes, it all indicates that we are in a pretty strong bull rally and could lead to the kick off to a full bull run. 
10,500 area could be the first reversal to test support zones before, 12,150 which is the main target to confirm the bull run. 
I have a charts indicating exactly what transpired the past 6 months from December’s massive 
H&amp;S formation, all the way down to what’s going on now, which is an inverse H&amp;S on the day chart.
If we do go under 9600. Next major support is 9300 and 9100 only a true break on 8900 will set off a bear market again and return down to 3500.
But again you do not have to listen to me...it’s just my TA.

Truly you don't understand blockchain technology...bitcoin isn't poised to do certain things with the way bitcoin code is written (some of these shit coins you so much like calling, like sia) have done extensive research and capitalized using the same tech as bitcoin but adjusted their blockchain to serve better for other purposes. 
Sia dev team is great and have used bitcoin coders and developers to verify their blockchain. Like many others have...
Example Vinny Lingham long time investor in bitcoin and bitcoin maximalist realized that bitcoin is in its own category which it does well...and decided to build something bitcoin can't offer, the guy just built civic, on ethereum...whether you want to call them shit coins or not it doesn't matter, what matters most is if you are investing in cryptocurrencies, you look for real uses cases with platforms in development who understand the complex nature of blockchains. 
To me a lot of you who call other blockchain projects (shitcoins) do not truly understand bitcoin and the technology. A lot of you shitcoin callers...are uneducated and are just riding the bandwagon of uneducated kids or adults who have not the slightest clue of what bitcoin is.. ( great job you can read Reddit post)
The guy who made this post jumped into the crypto market late in the game...at the end of the Elliot cycle...he didn't research anything he didn't find stuff he believed in he didn't find the uses cases he didn't check for dev teams, road maps achievements or anything he just had money to dump and unfortunately hit the market late and with out knowledge...he will get returns once the market matures and more people are educated but will need to very patient and accept a lot of his projects he chose could go up in flames.
If you hodl yes a lot of coins he invested in will most likely end of as vaporeare and many blockchain projects will again get traction and start moving once uneducated people understand blockchain tech is much more than what bitcoin offers...
Bitcoin will always be the highest speculated crypto, but their will be other cryptos that do what bitcoin wasn't made to do...or be.
Understand cryptography and blockchain before making SHITCOIN comments.

Be aware it’s headed to 10k$ before the true correction hits, the 7900 to 5600 was a small correction before the true parabolic spike to 10k$ headed there by December 10-15 you heard it first here.

Awkward way for someone as profound as the alias satoshi to make a “twitter post”. SN would not reveal such a dire warning on poorly regulated platform. If it was SN  I strongly believe SN would contact developers who have been helping maintain the network since the inception of the project. SN will continue to stay anonymous for very very obvious reasons. Specially in this day of regulatory uncertainty and fraudulent people claiming to be SN.  
SN had a plan and from the moment SN completed the plan SN new it was no longer in control. 
SN gave control of the project to the public  with which ever result it has  it was and still is an experiment.  So far it is still working as planned  to this day Bitcoin still is Bitcoin and will continue to operate as such.

Wtf is cloackcoin...I mean really it uses derivatives from bitcoin, attempts to use signaling like ether...and it's funny that they emphasized on (uses enigma) that's just the name of the machine used back in ww2 by the Germans and a machine that used cryptography to encrypt its messages...(blakeb2b and others use this type of cryptography) nothing special about the coin many out there do the same thing...
It's basically trying to play of bitcoin not being anonymous...which it is, if you want bitcoin to be anonymous.
You can create a new address every time when sending bitcoin hidden IP address with a vpn and have no connections to any kind of formal or informal information about yourself...
How it is not anonymous....
But most people use bitcoin in a more store of value minimal transaction way and do so through banks or other forms of personal information which in turn are willingly exposing some information about them self on their most likely multiple used address.

Not making falls predictions I am making my own analysis of the situation....and analysis based on 3 years of following very closely as to what bitcoin does and for the record the 5000k drop was very much predicted
Rsi levels reach 80 and we're completely over bought and the only line of support from the 2400-5000 rise was 3000...
As well as I follow credible analyst who have been pretty damn accurate. I don't say and do shit out of my ass
 
Again I'm making my calls I am not asking you to follow but I'm making my call for my 2btc sold which I can post if you want but currently I have it set buying back In at 2750 
If the second drop happens which normally does it will test 3000 again and test further lower levels for a very short period before bouncing back over 3000 and settling above 3200 and slowly climb back up to 4300$
The drop could very well happen right around the full closure and withdraw of funds from china...which is dated for sept 20-30th after that we will see a bounce since as many of y'all have stated which I don't disagree, is that china won't affect the market to much.
After that we will see a historic rally to 7500$ with a minor pullback before a full surge to 10,000 and with a major correction after that.. good sell limit would be 9925-9975$
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:17:39
Didn't know the news were coming but rsi was reaching 80 on the day chart and 4hr chart all levels showed over bought it rallied from 2400-5000$
Also Sheba jafari economist for  Goldman Sachs predicted the 4800$ before a correction...she has been very accurate so far, I follow her advise...there was a clear top that formed when it reache 4984 on gdax and the sell wall was extremely prominent at 5050-5100$ I set myself for minimal loss on the uptrend but knew that 5k psychological point for the world market...
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:42:41
I'm going to go ahead and admittedly say I was wrong turned to a V shape recovery and still jumped in at 3690 made little gains but definitely not what was expected...

Agreed traditional charts don't always work but human reaction does not change with any market. Humans are irrational creatures and we act in waves...we follow...we scare easy. Follow human market reaction plus news plus some economic movements and the market is in a way predictable as well as by using the Fibonacci sequence helps

@_date: 2017-09-15 20:08:26
Yes it was predicted that a correction would come at 5k$
So I sold at 4975 on a limit order for 5 btc
Placed my original buy order at 2900 then moved it up to 3090
Sold 2 btc at 3800 buying back in at 3200$
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:22:10
Damn yeah I was in bed with my girlfriend on vacation in San Francisco, woke up at 5 am when it started surging 4800 and I had my original position at 4875 then got very bullish and moved it to 4975 and lucked on gdax hitting 4984! Paid of my entire San Francisco trip with that trade!
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:14:19
Nope. I sold at 4975 bought back in at 3090 sold again at 3800.
There is still Chinese that will sell more pushing the price down one more time if it doesn't break 3200 we are in the clear but if 2900 is tested again we may see 2800 tested

I didn't mean literally I'm meant that with that trade what I had saved up for my trip was essentially returned with the profit I made on one trade...it was a very unexpected  outcome with a high profit...in (BTC) still holding but did sell 2 at 3800 expecting a possible double bottom.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:45:09
I just did make a prediction I sold at 3800 and predicting it will dip again to 3000...I only commented that it will dip again 
so the sale isn't over...
if you want a prediction then, 
7500$ is the next stop before a minor correction to test 5900$ then rally straight to almost 10k$ before a major correction...
my next big sell off will be set 9900-9975$....
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:42:30
So quick to verbally attack, your level of intelligence shows...and yes I've had losses..as well as many gains (for the record i bought into ethereum at 5$ and litecoin at 2$ bought siacoin well under 100 sats...so yes rich already happened and now I am playing with my gains...if you want to see my portfolio I'll gladly share it with you via private message)....and I am just commenting on a Reddit post about trading...but why argue with someone that has a competent level to verbally attack someone who they have no idea of or who they are. you are just ignorant...and I am sharing opinions on the current market. 
I have been in crypto since early 2015
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:19:58
It was also clear to see where the bounce would be since the previous weekly high was between 2700-2900, which would set up a major resistance point...I wanted to put my buy order at 2900 but seemed risky so I moved it to 3100 then wanted to get greedy and make few extra btc decimals so I set it to 3090$
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:14:40
First sell of 4 btc 
Second sell of 2 btc
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:01:04

Bear trap, consider the abundance of news upcoming. This will bounce of 8300 support. Rally to 11900-12k June correct to July 7400 stabilize around August 10k fomo will kick in by October and by then we should start seeing a parabolic increase to 25,000 by November correct to 15-19k for a few days blast to 300,000 December January February correct to about 50-60k bounce...from there is still to soon to say
