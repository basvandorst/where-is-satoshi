This is an event that is potentially related to bitcoin. Because it changes the dynamic of potential adoption (or discussion) of bitcoin in Russia. Any news like this should very obviously be posted here, or we're in a dark room where we only see things that already happened related to bitcoin rather than being able to see potential events. And this is also an interesting discussion from a bitcoiners perspective.

I've been lurking this sub for over a year and have seen many comments like yours, but I have honestly not seen even close to enough of the "circle jerking" and downvoting of criticism to warrant having the attitude of "this is the way this sub is and there's no discussion". (btw I've actually asked people for examples of downvoted legitimate criticism several times, never got an answer).
It looks to me like unnecessary focus on a minority which can get vocal at times. Which ironically stunts discussion because it partly puts whatever the current discussion is in an unprogressive tone, and it really has nothing to do with the discussion in the first place.
Just felt like putting that out there.
@_date: 2014-12-09 05:58:07
Show me one example where legitimate criticism has been downvoted please. The only thing I've seen regarding this is posts like yours saying that it's happening. And I've asked for examples at least 5 times in the past, with no answer each time.

I don't really like the way he answered the questions. He sort of dodged questions like a politician. He could do better than that. Maybe he isn't so confident in his bitcoin knowledge?
For example he could've addressed the volatility question by explaining that volatility may decrease over time as the market matures. And that volatility in such a currently speculative and new market with a low market cap is to be expected for the time being.
Not that I'm hating though :)

Or maybe it's because people frequenting bitcoin forums have better knowledge on bitcoin than those who don't. And this may even be *because* they frequent the forums.
Of course the article doesn't even consider this possibility. I'll consider that the echo chamber is a variable, though perhaps not as big of a variable as one might think.

I'd say it's the same thing. Revolutionaries (succesful ones) always use emotional lingo in the *correct* way.
I see your point regarding adoption being stunted by ideology. On the flip side, it may be that the "political ideology" has to be the spark. The more people realize the unfairness of things, the more inclined people are to use bitcoin, which is self evident. For this to happen, awareness has to grow. Growing pains.
Also, I think bitcoin has enough merits in itself that ideology doesn't even have an effect. The media (and whatever discussions come up) can only bring up associations to pirate bay and tor etc. so often until the real meat has to be taken up. And besides, pirate bay and tor and such are increasing in popularity due to people realizing that it's "right". (I'm not neccesarily saying it's all "right"). Am I making sense? I'm tired.

I think what u/Vibr8gKiwi is trying to convey but is failing miserably at is that it's not so much an ad as it is a PR attempt. I don't see it as an ad either, I see it as spreading a message.
Regarding 'making a promise' with the sign, if I had the sign and anyone asked I'd say that bitcoin isn't there yet in infrastructure, but it is fully conceivable and I'm highlighting that fact because it's good people know. Especially considering the fact that western union is not giving bitcoin any support to meet that end and is in turn not so nice to its less fortunate customers. (which of course is due to money, but that's a different story)
Whether bitcoin will be successful or not in the future is an entirely different discussion that he seems lost in.

I don't believe that to be any evidence for one thing or the other of course, I'm neutral with regards to paid trolls being real or not because I'm a scientist and I don't see anything conclusive at all. But I rather find it interesting because the energy of the reaction is so shrill.

I think you're getting hung up on the word 'middleman', there's more to it than just 'get rid of middlemen' and I think a lot of the time people say that they mean get rid of the unnecessary middlemen. (Especially considering different middlemen are treated differently, like you point out)

Good post. Did you comment in any of the threads on r/bitcoinmarkets asking longterm future bears for their opinions? I remember there was some good discussion there.
Regarding the zeal of some people here, this is something I like to keep an eye on in communities for the sentiment side of investing. I've definitely been seeing this community evolve over the past year and a half. (Combined with more and more exaggeration from r/buttcoin). Because as discussion trends grow and the community stays the same size, people have introspection and "grow up" on certain things. The hive mind evolves its intelligence slowly but surely.
There has been progressively less examples of people giving horrible financial advice and horrible security advice. So I think it's actually good that the bitcoin price has been horrible this year, because if more people joined in it would've stagnated the maturity growth of this community and maybe been a disaster.
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:01:30
I don't fully agree with your approach OP. I agree that going all out is very silly though.
My way is subtlety, which requires a bit of thought at first but can be done in a very easy-going fashion once you wrap your head around it. I recommend anyone to take a thinker on what subtlety means in this case, because it might just save you from cringe'ing at your past self.

A deceptive argument against what exactly? The dollar **does** buy drugs too.
I do not agree with that being a good parallel. It's rather like only saying that cancer kills too, with nothing added or implied. And now we're back to this: what do you mean by death in this parallel?
I will draw a different parallel where two different shops sell candy. The second shop has less candy for sale, but the candy is a larger part of the shop's assortment of goods relative to the first shop.
Does this neccesarily mean that candy has anything to do with the rest of the shop's assortment of goods? And does the second shop neccesarily have a special inherent relationship with candy? ^(no and no.) Fact is that they both enable drug trade, and that's the only thing that can be argued.
Silkroad became the first trend use-case for bitcoin, and so the shop started off with a relatively big share of candy in its assortment.
@_date: 2014-10-20 17:17:46
Okay, so you mean you're not trying to make a point other than that the % of transactions related to drugs is higher?
The reason for my original reply to you was because there seemed to be reasoning to bring it up apart from correcting that guy (which of course is reason enough, just that it didn't seem worded as such). And so I thought you were bringing it up as a negative point. Which is what I meant by not seeing where death fits in (death being whatever negative point you were maybe trying to make, mortality rate being rate of drug transactions). Nevermind in that case.

I see what you're getting at, he's putting emotions into it in order to try to put strength in his statements, which is superfluous. These statements shouldn't need an emotional boost and for anyone who he'd like to convince it just comes off as an attack.


Now you're doing the same thing, that's silly.


Wider? I nearly only see buttcoiners raving about this. And to look at it as a potential reality is healthy I think. Considering bitcoin might change a lot of things, it's worth considering (as in having an open mind) and investigating possibilities instead of leaving things to chance. There's so much trolling that is slowing down intelligent and rational discussion in this sub. This sub may not be so intelligent and rational to begin with, but that's beside the point. The trolls make a difference in the amount of intelligent and rational discussion. When ego is not involved, rational discussion flourishes.


"'ancap for crying out loud" huh. Explain? And I honestly have never seen outsider's perceptions of 'bitcoiners' being muddled by this. The only ones are buttcoiners. Though I guess they could count as outsiders. And I guess you might be right even if the angle I see it from is different from what you say. If people are so emotionally invested in bitcoin, they can come off as weird because of misjudgments and misconceptions. But at the same time, any person with average intelligence should realize that just because 1 in 10 bitcoiners they meet are really emotional about it shouldn't mean all bitcoiners are emotional about it. What a dilemma, I will think more about this.

*blaming myself for all I need help for...* (it isn't deep lyrics, but hey)
You are 100% correct, because at the basic level rather than thinking that you are not as awesome as they thought you were, what they're feeling is: Hey, he knows I'm awesome because he wants **my** help! And I'll help him because I think he's awesome too.
Their stance on you is not going to change just because you ask for help, rather they'll be glad to help because you're reciprocating. And everyone knows that everyone makes mistakes. Don't blame yourself, try asking for help and you'll be surprised.

@_date: 2014-08-28 18:11:48


Uhh, *what?!* Please explain. I've read quite a bit into the history of the studies that went on back then in Switzerland (which were the only studies), that is not **at all** what happened and those studies showed pretty damn good promise (*LSD, My Problem Child* by Albert Hofmann is a pretty good overview on this), until the US made the UN have everyone criminalize drugs.


Did you? And did you think about the implications? Just a year ago I was personally at a conference about the various psychedelic studies going on around the world, there is **a lot** of promise. The sample size of 20 people (in just *that* study) is just the beginning to show that there is potential. The potential shown from just that study of those 20 people shows that the chance that it is *not* beneficial is extremely low due to the results. It wasn't just "these people feel like they're doing much better.", they really *are* feeling better with a lot less PTSD symptoms.


You really haven't put any thought into this at all have you? Or are you misunderstanding PTSD and depression?

Interesting thought. I personally upvote what may be 'silly posts' because I see the core issues they speak of and feel it's good that such issues see the light. The way it's presented doesn't warrant a downvote or a non-vote from me. So I'm part of that silent majority for sure. That doesn't necessarily mean that there aren't posts I don't downvote, but I don't have to use the downvote button that often according to my own perception of what is silly.

Yeah, I'm aware of that absurdity. I was rather trying to extract any ounce of reason from his statements.
I wonder how (or if?) he thought people would take his argument seriously when he doesn't even explain. And the "dumb enough to buy into bitcoins" is very silly to me because my deduction is that it's not even a question of being dumb or not.

@_date: 2014-11-22 08:26:26
Alright. I see someone suggested you get a good wallet which is what I was going to suggest too. If you're interested to innovate or think of ways to help bitcoin I suggest you learn more than the basics. Because bitcoin is in such an early stage, if you'd like to contribute it's best to know the mechanics behind bitcoin. This is a pretty good video that explains the basic nitty gritty: 
@_date: 2014-12-26 22:58:27
Okay. Well I honestly cannot see how it's not relevant, so I guess I'm as confused as you but in the opposite direction.
Edit: Oh and yeah, as soon as something posted here is news that is related (or potentially related) to bitcoin's potential, often times one of them makes a snarky comment about it not being related to bitcoin. So thats's probably where the downvotes are from.

Ah back to this. He's disregarding everything differing as trolling now huh. Well I can't speak for OP unlike you.


Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the OP speaking about it as a possibility? Not as an absolute.

The teacher was probably trying to pick a little beef with his parent, because where else would the child learn about bitcoin? The teacher probably thinks bitcoin is a ponzi and that it was irresponsible of the parent to teach him (in the teacher's mind, brainwash) about bitcoin. And so in turn the teacher reacted relatively equally irresponsibly as he perceived that the parent did. This is how wars start.

I downvoted the thread because it's arbitrary. And I can sort of empathize and understand the OP, but I don't have that emotional viewpoint of the price.
Regarding your view of making this sub "look like coolaide drinking, head in the sand, loonies", I don't understand that at all, sounds like insecurity to me. I think anyone who actually thinks that is just maliciously looking for insecurities. Especially considering the arbitrary nature of this thread (anyone who is willing to think twice will realize that's probably where the majority of downvotes is coming from).

People are arguing the wrong pros and cons for bitcoin in this thread. It's not about bitcoin right now, it's about the function bitcoin may have as a currency in the future. The volatility of bitcoin right now is terrible for anything but day trading. The future of bitcoin use will be different if it grows, because its foundation is a lot stronger than any other currency (due to the way it functions).

It all depends on how you present it (and yourself). Don't try to convince, convincing isn't needed. Let them be interested if they want to be interested.

Calmly tell him to edit his reply to say "this particular middleman" next time. Don't lose your shit in vain.

You don't seem to take into consideration the fact that this community is completely mixed in opinions. There's no central consensus of opinion here so if you're looking for that you'll mistake it for delusion. Because you'll see different people saying different things. Could you give some examples of individuals who are deluded though? I'm sure you can, but how many? Of course there are deluded people in this community, the community is mixed. Do they make up a majority or even a significant portion? I think not. (That's my opinion on that). Also what deluded is in this case is very much up to debate.


I'm not trying to make it seem like you're trying to make a point here, but that is something people have said about pretty much every community of people out there. Just like the bitcoin community, there is no central consensus of the opinion of how the bitcoin community is, outside of the bitcoin community. I have personally talked with a lot of people about bitcoin and I have never heard or felt that they thought bitcoiners were deluded. I don't think we should cater to a clear minority (from what I see) of people who don't think about the fact that there's not a consensus of opinion here. I think the fact that opinions here are so diverse is great and leads to a lot of discussion.
Regarding middle man vs. middle man, is that really as simple as you make it seem? Banks vs. Bitpay that is. They're two entirely different types of middle men no? I have the opinion that bitcoin is good for getting rid of certain types of middle men. And that middle men such as bitpay are necessary for the growth of bitcoin (which in turn is necessary for progressively excluding the other type of middle man).
Edited away unnecessary stupid from my side.

I'm wondering if that was bitcoin's achilles heel (if bitcoin dies now), margin trading. Because as a speculative asset, a speculation on the factor of speculation (margin trading) should cause a cascade effect as we see now. Maybe this is a technological test we humans have to pass in order to have superior currency, to not give in to the greedy temptation of having the function of margin trading before it becomes an accepted currency.
Just rambling

I didn't really like his answer to the investing in bitcoin question, feels like he took a walk. Especially when he made the speculation that it'll follow gold. A non speculative answer fits better for something that people have yet to understand.
I think he should've emphasized that bitcoin is still a highly risky investment and to only invest what you're willing to lose. Perhaps also add that it's worthwhile learning how bitcoin works. And to see it as a small part of your portfolio that *might* flourish and become more predictable in the future.
The rest of the interview was great though.
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:11:38
I wonder if that article can be spiced up a little bit, like a new section discussing the potential philanthropic aspects of bitcoin in the context of potential future uses *if* adoption becomes large. The thing is that there is information to back the potential up, just has to be written unbiased.
Because as the article reads right now it's pretty dull. Adding a little bit of thought provoking material (that is of course not subjective, but rather a discussion of the real *potential*) isn't unheard of on Wikipedia is it?
Edit: And why is there even a section discussing a ponzi scheme dispute when it simply is not a ponzi? Feels like addressing the trolls and giving more air for misconceptions.
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:25:55
Because it might be a nice advancement for society
@_date: 2015-01-19 08:01:07
Wow that sucks. Worth a try though! Because I mean, there *are* reliable sources of information on bitcoin, because when you get down to it the mechanics of bitcoin are open-source. And so the source should be that all coders verify that it works (I guess?). If that doesn't work, an official statement and academic work by a coder should be done in order to verify it for the most stubborn.
@_date: 2015-01-12 08:50:02

What I meant is the word delusional. In what way or definition are you applying it here? I'm asking this considering that the original comment called it too grandiose, and that seems more of an accurate description to me because of circumstance.
Edit: Wait, you didn't quite listen to what he said in the video did you? He was talking about government from the economics (printing money) perspective. It's quite clear that he has misconceived what government as a whole is. That's not delusion, it's misconception.
@_date: 2015-01-12 19:07:14


Aha so this is factually correct then. LOL..


Is this fact too? Is it an echo chamber of positive bitcoin sentiment or is critical thinking (that does *not* necessarily have to include BS at every turn) allowed? You've checked the facts?

I lurk here *a lot* and time and time again I have purposefully observed when (constructive/legitimate) critical content has been voted on, and there hasn't been much downvoting. This is a subject I'm very interested and skeptic (in both directions) about to see if it's one way or the other, and so I've been trying to witness it.
From what I see the deluded are a very tiny minority who's votes don't actually play a significant role. Try watching a new comment that you feel you fought for to upvote and see if it has really been a fight. But maybe you've already done this and have seen a different result than me? In any case, I'm interested to investigate/discuss further, because it really is a hot topic of critique against r/bitcoin right now (ironically).
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:55:57
It's definitely never going to "catch on" if it's a thread that's floating around, because it's not "regular"/routine. Might not work when stickied either, but it's definitely worth trying for a while.

I'm a pretty experienced holder, so my emotions right now are more of excitement than anguish. But when I've traded, my emotional strength has been very varied depending on my current confidence in the trade. Because I haven't had such a strict trading method.

I agree. Not only to strengthen arguments for bitcoin, but also to improve patience when put in the situaton of someone else trying to push your ego. Whether that ego pushing is to make you mad at their argument, make you feel unconfident/hesitant or passive/meek. More patience = less of those kinds of negative mind states when speaking about bitcoin.
I think acknowledging that there are trolls is awesome. Because it brings up the discussion of this exact thing you and I are saying here.

@_date: 2015-01-13 11:15:20
Disclaimer: I'm only hypothesizing.
A possibility that I have hypothesized is that the mtgox coins were stolen by someone who would like to slow bitcoin's market down as much as possible, for whatever reason. (I know some of your thoughts just jumped to thinking that I'm blaming it on the banks, but don't think too quick, I haven't even thought that far). And so the bearwhale that we have seen will have sold coins at specific weak spots of the market to trigger people getting stopped out and selling. Forming the market to be bearish so to speak.
I've been keeping an eye on suspicious sells since the beginning of August, 2 months before the bearwhale became a concept on r/bitcoin. People had already coined the term bearwhale for a slew of sells at weak points in the market at that time, which was what got me thinking this through these past months.
This bear trend probably would've happened anyway if not for [hypothetical bearwhale], but to a way lesser degree. The entry point and shape of a market changes the future of the market dramatically compared to if the entry point was different, chaos theory explains this in a good way:  Hope that explains the general gist of what I'm trying to say, I can't think of any other example. Otherwise ask and I'll try to reiterate after some sleep.
Figured this is a good thread to share this thought. I'd love to hear if anyone else has thought of the same thing and been able to disprove this in ways I haven't thought of. (I'm not implying "hah you can't disprove it so it's true", L2science if that was your thought). I'm *incredibly* tired so I bet I made some weird writing mistakes and left something out, I'll fix this post up later.
@_date: 2015-01-12 10:38:20
I agree with you. It can get a little tedious though. But only a little imo, I nearly don't mind at all and think it's fun. So I think complaining about it is more over the top than what is complained about. Let people have their fun I say.
@_date: 2015-01-20 05:37:43
You keep throwing that word around (and I see it thrown around *way* too much around here). Try misinformed or ignorant or something of that nature. Otherwise everyone and their mother is delusional, because everyone's misinformed or ignorant about things. Delusional is when a belief is held despite concrete evidence of the contrary being presented directly to them.
For example if you now google the explanation of the use of the word delusional and still use it this way, you're delusional. Or perhaps I'm ignorant.
Edit: I mean misinformed

I agree with you it's a little frustrating, but:


My answer is: You **idiot**, Bitcoin would be the LEAST of your worries if that happened. You'd likely be dead in months."
Relax. From his standpoint in knowledge he think's it a legitimate concern. Patiently explain how it really is and move on. The biggest barrier for adoption is knowledge, and however stupid some people may seem, all it is are knowledge gaps. And knowledge gaps can include ways of critical thinking too, which can be infuriating to some.

I agree with you, discussions about this (arguably) meta issue of trolls should be well placed and thought through. This is just impulsive, there's no saying if there are shills here or not and no reason to speculate wildly either. What's important to openly discuss is the effect of the trolls imo.

My personal observation: after pushing their buttons for 5 months, I've come to the conclusion that either they all have some psychological disorder in common to different degrees, or a portion of them are paid and the rest have the psychological disorder and joined in unknowingly. In either case their effect on this community is the same; making a bitter atmosphere that sticks.
Concern trolls is the type of troll they could be defined as, right? Or is there a different word for it? I saw someone call them something like that the other month.
Edit: Btw, this look familiar?  Doesn't prove anything either way, but the effect is the same since they're doing the same thing.

Same goes for gold. Where the value after the bubble would pop would be its industrial value. (Which is of course *much* lower than gold's current value). I don't believe there's any reason for people to come to a point where they feel it's pointless though. If anything, the realization that it's pointless comes **before** the notion of "well hey, it can store value because it's a consensus".

Yeah, you could have a device containing the latest blockchain before the power outage to verify that the bitcoins are on that address. And on top of that, since you can hide the private keys with a holographic sticker, the bills/coins could be made unforgeable in the same way as current fiat. So a blockchain containing device would be overkill to begin with in most cases.

The comments sections on VICE videos...
It's so easy to shill/troll on youtube because of the way the comments section works. The original commenter can delete any replies made in their 'thread', so after a replier leaves they sometimes delete all of that replier's comments. And the way comments that get downvoted a ton can float up to the top by just having a few upvotes and a lot of replies makes it very easy to dominate the comment sections.

Bitcoin doesn't inherently mean unregulated exchange. They're unregulated because they couldn't be regulated from the get-go.


I'm assuming you mean the choice between using bitcoin and not using bitcoin here? (Which is redundant). If not, can you explain when there was a choice for regulated exchanges back when bitcoin came around?
Edit: Couldn't be regulated at the start is what I mean of course.
@_date: 2015-02-02 10:26:07
You mean which circumstances can make regulated exchange possible? I guess you missed the news that there actually is a regulated exchange now. Look up coinbase exchange.
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:12:59
You're arguing that that was the demand?
And no, not entirely. I've only seen a minority, and I've been here since summer 2013. Usually a reason for the hatred is given in circumstance, that doesn't necessarily mean that person X always hates regulation.
Edit: As usual when you are presented with the word "necessarily" your egos are all like *"downvote this! he's bringing up possibilities that go against my hatred views!"*
@_date: 2015-02-22 07:52:58
It's a conspiracy.
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:35:07
It's a known fact that is a troll and so it's clear to me that it's choice if he wants to debate with him or not.
That doesn't have to mean has appeared to be trolling right now, but with all probability, will bring his troll-game into the debate when/if brings proper arguments. Which is just tiring. I don't feel like jumping into this debate either for this reason, I don't have much tolerance or patience for bullshit.
Edit: If anyone else has the patience to debate and is able to call the bullshit out as it comes, that'd be great.
Edit2: Downvote, the truth hurts. That you trolls can't be expected to be taken seriously because you've spent all of any respect that you deserve. This is what Reddit Enhancement Suite tagging is for.

Aww, I see that the vote brigade came and gave you a band aid. Do you feel okay now?
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:14:32
You're taking this way too seriously.
@_date: 2015-02-19 08:52:41
If you wanted to play nice you'd give me room to tell you the large difference between "probably" and stating something as an absolute.
@_date: 2015-03-15 01:46:31
No, it hasn't. It's only been a freaking year.
And as to if you're trolling or not; you're not making *any* sense, that much is sure.
@_date: 2015-02-26 04:27:37
Aha you mean misleading. Yeah I don't think misleading people is good.
In what way are they going to be misleading?


Say again?

With all probability he's trying to troll you, nearly no one's that irrational. Don't let him get to you.
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:33:41
I lost 0.2 btc, and I'm fine with that because I knew that this was a risk, so I never had any significant amount of btc on there. Drugs are cheap anyway, I don't get why anyone would have over 0.5 btc there at a time.
@_date: 2015-02-27 22:16:01
*oooo*, so shady.
Edit: His previous comment was:


It's hilarious how he pretends not to understand why that was downvoted by making this new comment. Simultaneously his new comment bears no substance either.
@_date: 2015-02-25 01:35:00
What are the drawbacks? I think that planting seeds is wise.
@_date: 2015-02-24 03:17:07
Because of an image thread? Or something else?
@_date: 2015-02-15 00:27:04
He sold bitcoin at 1200, nothing more about bitcoin? Cool kid anyway, I'd like to meet him.
@_date: 2015-02-09 12:36:23


**(Points to current bitcoin users)** Evidently this is not true.
@_date: 2015-02-13 10:34:25
Ah so you guys went into depth on the topic at hand :)
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:25:20


No, it didn't go that far for people simply questioning. The trolls were the ones saying that was what happened. Fact was the closest that was to happening was when they were doing their usual troll posts, calling people delusional etc. I seriously am curious if they legitimately are confused why they got downvoted.
Edit: I've been here constantly since summer 2013 btw, this is a new account
@_date: 2015-02-20 08:35:11
Detailed explanation please. **Grabs popcorn**
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:30:52


I've seen this said by troll accounts for over a year now (not saying you're necessarily a troll...) and I've never understood where this comes from. Can you give any significant amount of examples of legitimate criticism being downvoted? Or is it just a troll meme to be all like "hurr, why am I being downvoted?".
@_date: 2015-03-11 00:24:24
Oh sorry I'm not trying to dox you or anything. Don't dox yourself. I was curious because I wonder to what extent one would have to write seriously enough for it not to be taken off. I'm guessing someone or some people have a low tolerance threshold for this because of being biased.
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:26:05
@_date: 2015-02-23 01:53:17
Yep, either 0 or between 10k and 5m. Not *because* of the 99% thing though.
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:09:45
I'm pretty sure he's saying that because of the supply rate, not because of some unique bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-02-02 11:51:13
Yes, the transactions are unregulated. An exchange is a spot for exchanging bitcoin for dollars and vice versa. So I wasn't surprised, I thought you were genuinely trying to heckle so I responded with sarcasm.
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:36:25
Ok wow you're explosive.
@_date: 2015-02-13 13:57:49
So we're talking about skepticism now.
@_date: 2015-02-26 04:36:30
Aha I thought you meant saying misleading things about bitcoin itself. I don't care if people think person X has bitcoin or whatever. If Ashton Kutcher doesn't actually have bitcoin or have an interest in bitcoin, I don't see what difference that makes, because no one's been misled about information/knowledge.
Btw, what about your twitter page? Do you consider that misleading?
@_date: 2015-02-28 09:20:03


Of enthusiasm. Zealotry, not as much. But trolls are hungry.
@_date: 2015-02-01 13:51:44
Fact is that I have no clue what you're talking about. Sounds delusional to me, honestly. Unless you're ignorant of the relation between bitcoin and exchanges of course.
@_date: 2015-02-13 06:32:52
What did he say or what was the discussion to make you realize this?
@_date: 2015-02-21 23:45:34
The psychedelic theme makes me like the company in a personal way, but not a professional way.
@_date: 2015-02-23 06:52:00
Looks like the perfect place for to pour money in order to push down bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:00:34
Yes and no, maybe so.
Everything being relative isn't a scientifically proven/backed concept, but it's feasible if 11 dimensional M-theory is considered (along with some of the other extra-dimensional theories I think, but I don't know much about them). Look that up if you want to melt your brain a little.
Everything being relative is also a very messy thing to philosophize about, because what is meant by the concept in the first place is a confusing (relative? :P) topic.
@_date: 2015-02-16 08:25:36
Then why did you say you did?
Edit: OH now you're making the voting obvious. Thanks for the motivation &lt;3

I think planting seeds is organic
Edit: as opposed to forcing it. If bitcoin would be mentioned in the context of "my friend just texted me he bought some bitcoin", with nothing more said, that simply puts the idea in the viewer's possession and nothing more added.
@_date: 2015-02-16 06:56:57
You did?

Not to forget; bitcoin can be issued as physical cash too.

Of course not.
@_date: 2015-02-13 10:57:55
You say "you just don't like what I say." as if that validates what you say. You say controversial bullshit a lot, and it's completely obvious it's intended as such. "I. Do. Not. Troll." Hahaha
A lot of what you say I'm perfectly fine with though, I upvoted a couple of those comments. Substance? I guess I intentionally bend things for controversy too ;)

Nah, no misleading information. Just selective information, which is potentially misleading by omission. Just wanted to see what you thought of that.


Shills for bad cause =/= shills for a good cause. And besides, the obvious fallacies there are obvious. The exact same people? Hm okay. Or maybe you're not making an argument here and you're actually being upset over nothing?
@_date: 2015-02-09 14:39:44
How about both?

I'm talking about trading bitcoin. Please don't reply "well then you make your choice by trading bitcoin", lol. If you want to trade bitcoin, there is no choice. Feel free to argue that.
