Your payment needs to find a route to Shell.
Let say you have a channel with McDonald's and MacDonald's has a channel with Shell, then you don't need to open one yourself.
If none of your existing channels have a connection with Shell, then you need to open one with Shell directly or with another node which has a connection to Shell.

You can transfer the rights to the same people if needed on another repo. I don't see the issue.
