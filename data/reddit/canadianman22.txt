My employees and customers who had heard of Bitcoin thought the same thing, however after educating them on it and then out of interest they researched it on their own some more they decided it was something they liked. This is why I am spending my own time and money designing a pamphlet to print off and stock so this way anyone can read about it and I plan on including websites including this subreddit as a place people can go and learn even more and ask questions. If I can develop enough interest in Bitcoin, I am even considering setting up a terminal where people can purchase Bitcoin at my location, regardless if they spend any money with my business as a way to help spread it further to more people

No they are not refusing to deal with me, I am now refusing to deal with them. That is a pretty high level of stupidity. I may be fairly new to Bitcoin but I know its not that. I told them that any currency can be used for that stuff, and informed them I will be transferring my accounts to another bank. She freaked since it is a decent sized business account and she has sent 2 emails asking me to reconsider.

Thank you, thats the kind of stuff I am looking for

That is actually really cool. I had no idea bitcoins could be broken down that far. Seems like there is a good reason that as technology takes over more and more bitcoin will become even more important. I feel even better about accepting bitcoin now. I think in store I will offer a slight discount for using bitcoin since it seems like no transaction fees are taken

Thanks for the bits. You just helped start me off on hopefully a long and successful bitcoin venture.

What computer are you trying to use it with?

Have you offered your employees the chance to take some or all of their paychecks in bitcoin? I am not sure how well it would work out (Based on reporting their income to the government) 
That is good to see other businesses keeping percentages of bitcoin instead of converting it.

Whats changetip? And ok thanks I will look into that as well.

No fuck Microsoft. I have installed Windows 10 and for the fifth fucking time there is no **GODDAMN SKI FREE!!!!!** I was a kid when I installed the best operating system of all time, Windows 98, and I use to spend hours playing that damn game, trying to outrun that bastard. They need to update the game, first person it using a decent engine and sell it. So I guess ill have to do that. Damn it

Glad to see other small businesses doing this. I just recently started accepting bitcoin from customers (With a discount since we can avoid those fees and even taxes) and it has taken off. People love it and it has made them aware of whats going on. I am actually currently designing a pamphlet to hand out so my customers (Or even non-customers) can pick it up and learn, and hopefully convert some. 
If I may ask a question (feel free to PM me the answer as it would remain private) but do you accept Bitcoin (I would hope) and if you do how much of it do you keep as bitcoin vs how much you covert into your local currency? I am curious as I am considering not converting between 25-50% of bitcoin transactions per month. Thank you in advance.

It is going to be funny when this guy has to resign thanks to his comments. I cancelled my business Mastercard and told them the reason for it. They did not seem overly pleased and said it seemed like a "silly reason to cancel". I told them I prefer the future to the past and hung up. Will just use the business Visa card instead.

My bank told me about Bitcoin today. They said it was evil, supported drug dealers, rapists, murderers and child molesters. They also informed me that countries like Iran and North Korea used Bitcoin to skirt international sanctions and oppress their people while building weapons of mass destruction.
Looks like I now have to find the time and money to locate another bank that hires intelligent people to work there and actually researches something properly.

I think your problem is the UEFI motherboard. But have no fear, give this a shot. You can also disable UEFI and enable legacy boot, which should also work

Did you allow it to format the drive for you? Also did you run the program as an admin?

Damn if it were not for the fact our countries have no contact and that it would illegal for me to send you stuff, I could easily provide you with terminals thanks to government surplus. All you would have to do is install a HDD, install and configure your own OS (Since you are a software developer that would not be hard) Out of curiosity I am wondering if the item in the pictures is something your looking for?

Do not know. I have found a different bank. The person I deal with now not only knows about Bitcoin but thinks its cool. He learned about it after getting a briefing on the Bank Of Canada looking into creating a digital currency and how the bank sees the possibility of "cash" free society in the future. My new financial adviser said that he sees no down side of keeping a part of my businesses monthly bitcoin transactions as bitcoin, and just simply encouraged me to watch the market price and if it starts to slip, consider converting some out for safety.

I wrote a post on here yesterday about my new business and accepting bitcoin and I never thought about offer my employees the opportunity to receive their pay in bitcoin (in part or in whole) as well as offering a discount to customers who pay using bitcoin (Since it will save me transaction fees.)
After reading this, my business partner and I have decided to keep 50% of the total amount we take in via bitcoin as bitcoin. Maybe I will even be able to find suppliers who will sell me product using bitcoin so we can cut the government completely out of the loop.

What program did you use to put TAILS on the USB. If you are on Windows, I recommend using 
Never had an issue getting TAILS to run when I wrote it to the USB using that program. Hope this helps

Thank you. Shopify looks like a good place to start. 
Also do you recommend using Coinbase for my wallet? I have one but if Coinbase is better I will switch.

Let me know if not, I may have some other tips to try
