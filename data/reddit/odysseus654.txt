Unfortunately, I got "verified" days after bitcoin withdraws were closed, so I never had an opportunity to take money out of MtGox (and hadn't realized that they no longer supported international wires until they cancelled my bank transfers hours after I finally finished the paperwork to make them)

The only reason why they wouldn't be bragging about it would be the same reason there's a gag order -- MtGox is not the target of the seizure, but instead some other group they're not ready to "tip off" yet.  FOIA requests have been denied for much less.  But yah... until things get bad enough (or MK finds he has a much shorter end of "the deal" than he realized, if he has one) I don't expect anything outside of hearsay in any direction.

Likely the same framework that allowed them to go against Dotcom in New Zealand.  The fact that the funds haven't been transferred to new authority means that Karpele likely still has technical control over them, so this is more targeted towards him not to touch the coins than towards the coins themselves.
MtGox has until last year been the largest bitcoin exchange out there.  It has got to have been at least partially involved with the whole Silk Road mess that is still sorting itself out.  If he's under a gag then he's not the target, and with Silk Road in the mess having an exchange go down may be looked at as reasonable collateral damage.

There's no real evidence of anything either way.  I think at least part of this is desperation on behalf of people wondering "what the heck happened?!?".  None of the explanations thrown out there really make that much sense.
Sure the real story is likely a lot more boring than half the stuff on here, but who really thinks that Karpele is really stupid enough to misplace half a trillion dollars as if they were his car keys? (wait, don't answer that last one)
There's got to be **something** more to this story, and it looks like only one person in the world can say what that is, and he ain't talking

How do you know they wouldn't "let it get that far"?  Plus he's done a fair number of illegal things in response to the loss of funds.  I'm remembering Joseph Nacchio who went to jail at least partially because he wasn't able to defend himself due to a gag order.

Doesn't need to be torture for it to work.  I'm not specifically talking about MG here either.  Just keep in mind that advertising how secure your front door is means nothing if you leave a window open.  In general the weakest point of the chain is normally not a computer.  For bitcoin at the moment I'm thinking the weakest link is malware and untrustworthy exchanges.

I think the issue is that if you have a public key and a corresponding bad/corrupted private key, and you know how the private key was corrupted, you may be able to salvage 99% of the private key and use "half of AWS" to figure out that last 1%.  The crypto experts would be needed to figure out which bits are the good ones and how to go about finding that last 1%.  This would require the keys and knowing **exactly** how they are wrong (and getting very lucky).
And then again, it's possible that whatever happened to them means none of the private key bits are usable.  And at that point it's time to start building Dyson spheres...

This is why we have transaction fees.  If they don't want the fees then they don't have to include the transactions...

Not sure I'd depend on all those bits to protect your keys, there's always a weak link **somewhere** in the chain:

Umm, you just make them up? As long as you don't try to claim them (i.e. you aren't going to get a private key for them anytime soon), you can throw random money at any address you'll like.  Burn as many coins as you want I guess.

Considering this call center only exists now that they ran out of money, I suspect it's there only because of some law.  The only information they may have is what's on their front page and the call center may disappear once the bankruptcy is complete.
