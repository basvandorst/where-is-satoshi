Is it free to store my coins/keys/whatever on my phone/PC? Any good programs/apps for this? What about transferring to and from?

Good luck proving that

They halted trading

Exactly this. And just sell your $300k in BTC and take 100k to pay your taxes, pocket the other 200k. Or with draw bit by bit over the years so you're in a lower tax bracket

More? Or less? Lol

It's all you can do at this point. I'm just glad I didn't invest more than I could afford to lose
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:35:18
Is this for real? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:57:03
Lol wtf kind of bank orders you what, or what not to, spend your money on? Especially a small no name bank

Check btc price and make sure you're sitting down when you do

Meant like a date but thanks

Doesn't allow US customers
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:56:01
When did you sell?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:41:04
I hope you have a paper wallet considering you have about $85 million in BTC
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:23:49

Not buying bch myself. Sticking with the OG
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:48:07
Bch is now available on coinbase. Theory is people selling btc to jump onto bch. I imagine btc will go back up in the next few days. Hopefully considering I bought in at $17k+ lol
