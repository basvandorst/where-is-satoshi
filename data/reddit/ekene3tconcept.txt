yes, but the elaboration was for clarity
about the 2's , i guess it's a bug with reddit as i clearly numbered 1,2,3 , just now i tried editing and it is 1,2,3 but it appears as 1,2,2 for some reasons

I have been pondering on this lately and happy someone is reasoning the same.
reasons, why the dot-com bubble cannot be compared to the blockchain, are simple ;
1. Dotcom bubble comprises of companies, who are valued based on revenue and profits for the year. on the other hand, cryptocurrencies are based only on use and adoption.
2.Dotcom companies are centralized and funds might not be accurately channeled in the right direction, nowhere to accurately monitor except quarterly financials that might have been tampered
3. Cryptocurrency ecosystem depends on incentivizing every participant, meaning everyone is equally relevant, but dotcom companies have boards and CEOs that control everything.
The only bubble we have is in ICOs, about 96% or so can't remember the numbers have, lost almost all their value and gone into oblivion as either they can't accomplish their goals or they were an outright scam from the beginning. 
I personally feel coins that don't have their own chain or are still erc20 tokens without mainnet transactions asides trading in exchanges, should not be included in valuing the total marketcap of all cryptocurrencies , and if we do that the current value in the Mcap should be about 200Billion and bitcoin will have 60% - 70% dominance.

The reason why they disappear into oblivion after 6months of trade manipulating their token.
What I was describing there were real projects of which some ICOs are not all of them.including bitcoin, litecoin etc

A simple reply to this is adoption, LN will make Bitcoin useable as a means of transfer of value and with cheaper fees and borderless. Bitcoin has its brand and low supply working for it. Don't worry about those whom bought high and sold low they always FOMO back in again at a higher value, that's why its good to just hodl.
