I agree ��

Wow just tested it and my transaction was confirmed faster than it took me to copy and paste my lightning address.  Thanks Bitcoin community!  Anyone know how this works so fast? ( I mean the Twitter to sending my transaction not how lightning works as a second layer)

Banks lend out fractions of their required reserve in excess of those reserves by a factor of 10, not exactly thin air...
@_date: 2019-03-09 18:16:48
This is delusional, it would require I complete collapse of the world economy, we would all be beyond fucked if this occurred.  I'm still long-term bullish on Bitcoin, but if world reserve currencies are worthless it would require a zero marginal cost low scarcity world that doesn't yet exist but could through automation of labor and socialist redistribution, maybe within 100 years?

We have to treat bluewallet as a testnet with beta level security, for now at least ... I used a new address for my giverofbitcoin tweet because of how public it could be, not sure if that is helpful at all

Also currently Ian shillina is threatening suit on YouTuber SunnyDecree for discussing his failures on his channel.  
Crypto failures like fake Satoshi and shillina trying to stay afloat and maintain a false reputation in the prolonged bear by suing their criticizers.  
Fucking bullshit is my assessment.  I value open disagreements and free speech.  Criticism isn't illegal.

Check my response above, BTC could encourage investing small amounts of money in a potentially largely increasing value asset instead of wasting said money on luxuries or going into silly debt to "keep up with the Joneses".  
Usually investing (like in property) was thought of something only accessible to the wealthy.  
@_date: 2019-02-10 15:25:47
I kindve agree, but could you respond to his idea/tweet and the idea the bottom is already in?
@_date: 2019-02-07 03:47:29
I think in the US the top%1 should be taxed more, I don't think that would fix everything, but I've though that having more access to low income housing, healthcare and continued education would help upward mobility and lessen the vast income disparity over time, and allow the low class more opportunities to invest and create intergenerational wealth.

Seems sentiment is quite bearish in these comments, have you sold most of your BTC?  At what prices would you become bullish again?

Wow, very well thought out ideas presented here.  I agree with your views on physically demanding jobs and mental capacity not being correlated in the demeaning bias usually attributed there.  I hope what has been learned is even investing small amounts in appreciating assets (be it crypto small investments welcome or property needs larger cash reserves boxed out low and middle class from taking advantage).  Financial freedom comes from being wise with your monetary choices.  Many people go into debt over frivolous luxuries, when setting aside money and periodically investing while simultaneously avoiding high interest unnecessary debt is the solution.  I hope we can overcome widespread poverty on Earth, everyone is generating value through their physical and mental contributions.  Those with higher skills can get paid much higher than average but squander it away with poor choices (Mike Tyson losing 400 million before age 30), but people of modest incomes can retire early with relative financial freedom if they make smart choices investing.  Buy low and sell high.  Endure market cycles.  Crypto can be a vehicle for successful investing with small amounts of money or it could enable people to make overly risky choices and lose big, we have seen and will continue to see both.  I'm very excited over the potential for Bitcoin and crypto assets and think this is still quite early with long term potential being very high, but also obviously risky.  May we live in exciting times!

I meant you can invest with small amounts of cash in crypto, most real estate (property) requires having at least 50k+ in fiat saved up to start investing.  I know people who started investing in crypto with under $10 which anyone can save.

Where did anyone recommend everyone be rich? I don't foresee that happening in the current sense of the word, but through automation of labor we may see a low scarcity planet if we learn to tax the Uber wealthy high enough and redistribute it efficienciently enough, the average person in the first world nation's lives better than the Kings and queens of olden days.
Nobody is technically forced to do a a specific job, just if you lack skills or the proper socialization, or have a marked past it may be very difficult to advance in the labor market, I argue anyone could acquire new skills and make more money, let's go with learning to code and write software, anyone "could" do that, but most lack the drive and discipline to master coding in their  "spare" time.  Everyone could be forgoing rest to get more skills but most don't.  If you get 7+ hours of sleep every night that is a choice you are making for extra leisure, why should you be rich when there are people working literally 2x or 3x as hard?

I think he's just gauging the majority of sentiment.  A lot of long term bulls have been holding out for a further lower bottom, thus remaining bearish
@_date: 2019-02-10 16:32:15
That's exactly his point in the video 
@_date: 2019-04-24 20:06:01
The interest rates charged by the fed and banks in the us acts as a disincentive to borrow radiculous amounts of money, us could double their debt (add 20 trillion of debt to the balance sheets) and still only be in the situation Japan's in, also add that it's the world reserve currency because the system is set to punish govt borrowing. It doesn't mean all Doom and Gloom and BTC is the only way but I understand many economies are in more dire situations, I also am a firm believer in bitcoin, they arent mutually exclusive.

Companies margins appear tighter because tax incentives encourage it, this might encourage less growth and more of a focus on innovation to beat competition on grounds other than market share.
Also share prices aren't an accurate measure of profits
And current growth doesn't provide any tax burden against the automation of labor so current growth isn't really benefiting the labor market, it is lowering prices though.

You are naive to think your future happens without war and or famine in which millions or billions of people die?  Or you accept that outcome?
I support Bitcoin, but the idea of the dollar collapsing silently is radiculous and actually toxic to the crypto space.
Edit. Wrote stupidly.

Not true, been in since 2017

Your dismissal of regulation although true factually, would be a great hinderance on the adoption and value if BTC.  Andrew Yang has many great policies and I intend to vote for him and like seeing this post.  Your dissenting opinion doesn't mean people should be censored from sharing theirs?
@_date: 2019-04-19 22:54:00
LoL what the fuck?  What do you propose that is superior?

I agree that more decentralized governance is better, we already have that to a degree in the US in that most of what governs our lives is legislated on the state and local levels.  It's crazy to think the president should determine the lives of 300 million people, but how implement it will be done is through a transition from our current system and people voting for politicians who want to implement it?  Do you see an alternative ?  I'm not sure why you were so anti voting, democracy, or Yang ?

US has a GDP of over 20 trillion which provides the value to tax, and half of that 4 trillion is already being paid out in the form of social security and other gov transfer programs.  So taxing the 20 trillion at 10% provides the sustainable payment of the $1000 freedom dividend?
@_date: 2019-04-19 17:30:19
Do you mean AI or decentralized governance?
@_date: 2019-04-19 17:14:18
It is not useless.  Democracies are not always in line with the opinions of individuals but I'm guessing you have had some very bad experiences that lead you to believe the only way forward is for society to start over, that would bring unfathomable suffering for millions if not billions of people, so participating in a struggling democracy to progress in the best direction possible is the real solution.  Not all politicians are the same.  Don't give up.  Do your research.  Make a choice and own it.

How does this work to redeem? I hodl but never used the LN or the Reddit tipbots

Not necessarily, liquidity from miners wanting fiat is different than someone selling at a loss

Bank of America has worked well for me buying with coinbase.  Looks like they have filed quite a few crypto related patents and intend to keep being friendly for BTC
