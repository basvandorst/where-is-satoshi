You don't want to hold cash under mattress when the collapse comes. With bitcoin you can easly hide it and secure it, and if the time comes that you will need to run there won't be anyone to stop you from getting out with it from country. Also the sole fact that I can sell it all around the world and get my money wired to new bank account is worth it.

Because they can't be stopped  
You guys in USA probably don't know what happens when corrupt local gov sends all kinds of forces on entrepreneur, blocks his bank accounts without charges, makes him sit in cell block without any kind of explanation and when he's company is dead he awaits trial for 10 years just to hear "fuck off, we won't pay you for your loss"
  
Also you are lucky because you have "honest" banking system (It's obliged by laws, so atleast you know that you will have your money week after depositing), you don't see what happens in countries like for example Ukraine where people got robbed of there live savings by banks just because they are untouchable.  
 People put their hard earned money just to hear "fuck off, what you can do to us? NOTHING!"  
  
  
And this is why I own bitcoin

5. Wall Street  
6. Business to Business (imo killer app of bitcoin)  
7. Average Joe

First of all, why the fuck should I care about average Joe?  
Does he have funds he can put into bitcoin?  
No, he have debt.  
Does he have knowledge to built business around it?  
Probably no.  
Does he know how current financial system works?  
No.  
Does he need it?  
No.

This already happens in EU countries where food production can be subsidezed by EU donations. One guy gets donations, he can produce food at 0 profit while others struggle to win against low prices.

I thought about Bitcoin Wallet BUT instead of typing bitcoin address you would type in username/email/any other form of ID and it would send BTC directly to this person, but it would require of course database of users. This way we could make it more clear for average Joe to use. Plus if there would be option to instantly buy btc at current price like it is on coinbase. So basicly something like Paypal but with BTC and better.
