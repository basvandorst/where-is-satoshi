So what exactly determines what chain i transact on? The server I am sending from? 
Btw, thanks for answering these questions. Really appreciate it.

Good luck sir. Thank you for taking time out to answer some questions.

And when I try to move them, will electrum give me a prompt indicating which chain? how do i elect which train to transact on?

I guess thats the safest bet at this point. I just dont want my coins to  be worthless because I dont really know what I am doing or miss out on some major opportunities because again, I dont know what I am doing

Can you explain what you mean when you say "taint" their coins?

Why cant there be multiple successful cryptos? I dont think there will only be one successful one while the rest are left in the dust.

What happens if I do absolutely nothing? Just leave my coins on an electrum wallet? No sending. Just idle

Truthfully, I am pretty technologically illiterate. I just want to keep my coins stored away and have them unaffected by whatever is going to happen. If i get other coins from the other chain, will it show up in my wallet? Like will it show that I have this amt of BTC and this amount of another bitcoin? Or is it mainly like when I try to transact, which side of the chain it happens on?

To me, this is may be one of the biggest roadblocks to cryptos in general. You have to be pretty technically savvy to maneuver and operate with them. Without that background, trying to use them and secure them is not easy at all. How can this technology become adoptable when the average person cannot use it?

I think Mt Gox was a big deal although I wasnt involved at that point

The thing is, you cant rule it out. Literally, nothing with this is impossible because of how unknown it all really is. I tend to agree and think the 100k predictions  are somewhat wishful thinking, but the same can be said when BTC was $2 a coin and now its over 2K. The unpredictability of it makes it both risky and enticing.

You are very right. Either way i am going to just buy and hold them. I don't plan on sending them anywhere, they will simply sit in my electrum wallet for an indeterminable amount of time. I just want to make sure that plan isnt risky in of itself. 
I suppose there's always competition risk and failure for me to pickup on the new crypto that could make Bitcoin obsolete.

That is true. But right now the percentage of the population that uses bitcoin is minuscule. Something like 10 million? If  even 50 million  of the 3 billion people use this technology the market cap will grow and the fact that this is global will allow the growth to happen quicker.

This is really informative. Most people should read a few pages of this

Dont get me wrong, I am not sinking my entire life savings into crypto. That would be unwise. But i have definitely taken a long term position in bitcoin and litecoin to a lesser extent. At this point no matter what, i am not selling. There are alot of smart minds in this space, they have confidence in this technology and the ability for this to grow. Life is about risk/reward. Sometimes gotta take the risk.

The long term play is that bitcoin becomes more widely adopted and ingrains itself into the global economy.  There is no way to determine the price or a projection. Trying to project something like this complete guess work. You could be right, in 5 years it could be worth 5k a coin. It could also be worth 12k by the end of the following year and 6k the year after that. Its unknown, and thats the point. The upside to something like this is clearly large. After 6-7 years it has only grown despite its ups and downs. Believers in the technology are willing to risk money and time for the chance that this or another cryptocurrency becomes an essential part of our monetary system.
