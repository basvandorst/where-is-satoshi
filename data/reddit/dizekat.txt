Geez you guys really are exactly as moronic as you are portrayed. No, the power plants literally turn on and off to match the load.

Wastes a shit ton of energy compared to a solution with an issuing agency (which wouldn't need to perform proof-of-work). 
In the long term it will eventually converge on only being profitable for one party (people with the best ASIC and energy combination), so this whole distributed aspect of it is short lived anyway.

It wouldn't even be unenforceable, it just would be backed with a lot more "or else go to jail for fraud". When probability of catching you decreases the penalties tend to be proportionally increased. So e.g. declaring bankruptcy while being crypto-rich is probably going to be a pretty bad idea.

The other coins were all falling too, no?

What I'm saying is that this hypothetical world wouldn't even have unenforceable laws or judgement, it'd just have much heavier handed enforcement due to lack of gentler options like getting money out of one's bank. 
edit: and I think he said she returned back to the US; well imagine hypothetically everyone's doing banking on their own computer, the probability of getting money back from a creditor decreases thus penalties increase to make up for it.
edit2: and as for full-on cryptolibertarian world, there the only way to get someone to lend you money would be to have your kneecaps and other body parts as a collateral. The fewer options are there for civilized resolution the less civilized the resolution is.
