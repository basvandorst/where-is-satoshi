This is my question also.  Is the number of BFX tokens fixed at 72.3 million (119,756 BTC lost x $604) ?  We need to be able to see that this quantity never changes.  No quantitative easing of BFX!

What is that damn annoying robot female voice throughout this interview? 
@_date: 2016-08-22 15:00:25
$72 million in BFX vouchers is possibly more than the value of iFinex.  What do they estimate the value of their company to be?  Reimbursing the BFX for equity is still the best solution IMHO but we need more transparency of the company’s financials. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 23:25:34
The ToS say they cannot be held liable for any losses so maybe they are in a position to socialize the losses with impunity.
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:05:33
It should be convertible to Bitfinex equity.
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:47:09
  I have read several suggestions by redditors that Bitfinex should offer equity in the company to replace the lost funds. In the form of bonds, shares or an altcoin.  This seems an excellent idea, the company could come back stronger and redeem itself in the eyes of the public.  Bitfinex was the best exchange and could continue with this honour.  As the ToS already state that Bitfinex accept no responsibility for losses this method of compensation is entirely possible.  I fear that if this does not happen the company will be attacked by vulture lawyers who I am sure are already circling with the intention of forced liquidation and taking as much for themselves before leaving scraps for the customers that lost money.  Zane, please do as much as you can to avoid this.  We do not need these criminal "justice" enforcers.  As Bitfinex existed in the semi-anarchic world of cyberspace it can be avoided.  Fix this problem yourselves and consider compensating the losses with company equity.  It would be a win for peaceful anarchy, an example to the world of solutions beyond the Big Brother extortion paradime. A new precedent in crowd sourced solutions!  There are several well thought out ideas on how it could be managed written by redditors.  You have not been online for 10 hours, I hope you are coping under the pressure. Please submit this suggestion to the management and let them understand what a pivotal moment in history this really is.  I would appreciate a response.  Long live Bitfinex.

The gold market is said to be controlled through its futures market by arbitrage play with the spot price and paper derivative dumps.   Could the same happen with BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:55:58

Wow!  Coinbase investors really lost touch with reality!  Kraken sold 0.5% equity on BnkToTheFuture and raised their minimum goal of $100,000 giving their company a cap of $20 million.  Bitso (a small Mexican exchange) sold 16% equity for $2 million giving them a cap of $12.5 million.  Kraken has volume of approximately half of Bitfinex at the moment. 
@_date: 2016-09-10 14:29:41
It is my understanding that the company is being valued at $200 million and of that $80 million will be sold or exchanged for tokens.  This valuation of a company that had about $10 million in annual revenue seems overpriced. 
@_date: 2016-09-11 16:32:29
Your comment has got me laughing! No magic!
The company valuation is determined by the price of the token.  Think about it.  
@_date: 2016-09-11 23:54:12
It's true!  You are a veritable poet!
@_date: 2016-09-10 15:18:58
Only if they are still convertible to shares, possibly after the 40% is sold/exchanged for BFX they will only be redeemable for $1.
Edit: If there is a panic to get shares the BFX could go above $1 before they sell the 40%! 
@_date: 2016-09-11 15:44:01
Seems like it is debt tokens it is measured in.
40% of the company is for sale. 72/80 = 0.9 and 0.9 x 40% =36%
36% of the company is tokens. If the tokens trade at $0.5 the company will be valued at $100 million, $1 gives a $200 million price so the valuation is being left up to the free market. If consensus opinion deems the company worth $20 million (like Kraken) the tokens will be trading at $0.1 each.
Adding the future redemption value of $1 complicates this model somewhat.
@_date: 2016-09-10 16:13:17
$80 million for sale (or swapped for BFX) of company valued at $200 million - 40 % for sale. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:52:03
Anybody brave enough to try this I would be interested to hear about your experience.
@_date: 2016-09-10 00:14:06
It says the "Pre-money valuation will be $120 million"  then "Maximum dilution will be $80 million" giving $40% to creditors/investors ($80 million is 40% of the sum, $200 million) so the token value and the company value have been added.
Is Bitfinex worth $200 million?
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:41:31

BTC makes the attack possible, the criminals could not accept cash or have a wire deposit to their account.  Bitcoin is traceable though which makes me think they could be caught with a bit of effort.

It is not the same in UK , it takes two days to send money to Kraken from a Fidor account.  Always exactly two days, still pretty reliable, good bank.
