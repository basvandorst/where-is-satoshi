Great, someone who has made nearly no contributions to Bitcoin Core in months, and a guy who has done nothing but add the monstrosity that is BIP37 bloom filtering (and associated vulnerabilities). Really if you're going to pull rank try choosing idols that are actually capable of maintaining the client.

Not changing is changing? Might want to check your logic there. 


Scaling has nothing to do with tweaking limits. Bitcoin is fundamentally slow, there is simply no room for increasing the load without even less people verifying signatures. If miners aren't verifying, and entities like blockchain.info with millions of dollars in funding aren't verifying, do you really expect anyone else to? 
If you think there is room for alteration, the burden is on you to prove the network can support it. Gavin making a few blocks on a VPS service is not sufficient to make alterations to a multi billion dollar network.

Nobody is saying consensus can't change the rules, we're just saying 75% of the mining hashrate isn't consensus. Seeing as the client originally specified no limit at all to block sizes, adding one is arguably a bug fix anyway. In the original satoshi client this was just another in a nearly limitless number of stupid vulnerabilities which are still being found and fixed today. 


You mean, from 11,000+ nodes to 6000 isn't a 50% drop?

If I make a fork which re-enabled OP_RETURN to do as it did in the original design (allow anybody to spend any coins even if they didn't own it), will you run the software? If you take the original codebase to be representative of the current network you're in for a massive shock, much of the design and code was completely unworkable and downright dangerous for people to run. 


You mean, like massive centralisation of miners, people not validating blocks because it takes too long, and a rapidly dropping number of reachable full nodes? There's lots of indicators, you're just ignoring them. We have pools saying quite plainly they can't operate with much bigger blocks, there's no second guessing here.

The removed post wasn't discussion, it was prompting people to download and use malicious bitcoin-xt binaries.

The addition of "NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE" carries about the same weight as "FOR TOBACCO USE ONLY" written on the side of a bong.

Altcoins are boring, none have many any interesting changes which justify their existance. They have no place spamming up the subreddit with self advertising. Tell me, in the thousand plus altcoins which have been made in 4 years, what exactly of value have we learned? That's almost an altcoin made per day, with nothing learned to speak of.

The ceo of an exchange giving people financial advice on reddit is super sketchy man.

They intentionally fork the network without consensus.
