Don't have any money in the game, just see a lot of people attaching emotion to their investment when they shouldn't be.

I think it is clear that in the last 6 months the bitcoin market isn't what it was the last 9 1/2 years (to use your decade timeframe). there is nothing slow about it in the traditional sense of investing.

You're trying to throw traditional market strategies at something that isn't a traditional market.

I'm very sorry to hear you didn't cash out at $20k. We all have that one that got away!

I agree in the traditional sense of investing on one of the major markets, this isn't that tho. There is nothing slow about bitcoin investments.

I agree with what you're saying. 
My original comment was meant for the people who bought in the last 6 months. You feel the price will go back up and that is fine, however if you keep buying below your initial purchase price and it never goes back up you're just throwing good money after bad.

You don't get it do you. You only gain money if you sell! (see how that is just as stupid as what you said.)
It doesn't matter if its a "loss" or an "unrealized loss" it's still a loss. You know you're allowed to sell and reinvest again to achieve actual gains instead of unrealized ones right?
