1. A transaction is confirmed by being included in a block (and thereby included in the blockchain). Every other block that is based on that block is seen as another confirmation. A block is mined approximately every 10 minutes. A transaction is generally considered fully confirmed after 6 confirmations. So it takes approximately 60 minutes for a transaction to be fully confirmed. 
2. You can only speed this up with the fee. The higher your fee, the more likely the transaction is to be included into the next block. 
3. You can not revert a transfer that's "pending" or "unconfirmed". There is a method that might work in 10% of cases but it's hacky and not included in normal bitcoin wallet programs. 
4. The protocol allows you to spend BTC after the first confirmation (which takes place after approximately 5 minutes). But I think most Bitcoin wallets force you to wait for 3 or 6 confirmations. I have never tested this though. 
5. "Confirmed" means that the transaction has been included in a block, and thereby in the blockchain, which is the dataset that includes all transactions that have ever been made.

Why? Because of DRM?

I remember when the price first hit $200 and people could not believe it and there was an image on Bert from Sesame Street all stoked on some price watch site (I don't even remember which one). Does anyone remember and perhaps still have a screenshot?
