Jacob from CrowdCurity here. 
This hackerthon will be great, and we will be around paying special attention to creative ideas in relation to improving security and transparency within the bitcoin space. And if someone can crack our site there are bonus points :)

Interesting move snapCard. Would love to spend bitcoin across more shops in SF.

Thanks! The community keeps us going :)

Hi Benktty.
You should have a look at  we have 1000+ security testers who work for bitcoin and who do pentesting.
I work for CrowdCurity.

Good stuff to see that OKCoin is launching a reward program and reaching out to the security community. This is great for transparency. Though it could be nice to see an english translation of the reward program as well. 
Disclaimer: We run reward program for many of the bitcoin exchanges.

Jacob here from Bitcoinfilm. 
Thanks a lot! On behalf of the entire crew I can only say that we are overwhelmed by the support. We do these film as "weekend projects" next to our work, and the support from the community makes it all worth. Thanks!

 the arbitrage will not work. 
The thing is that in Argentina you cannot just go into a bank and exchange pesos for USD at the official rate (4.70). As mentioned in the post there are severe dollar restrictions and nobody will be willing to exchange pesos at 4.7 per dollar. 
This is exactly the reason why there is a black market for dollars where the exchange rate is higher. However for people travelling to Argentina who wants to spend pesos in the country, the higher exchange rate can be realized by either bringing in dollars in cash or selling bitcoins as described in the post. Thereby they save 25% by not withdrawings at ATM's to the official rate.
 
@_date: 2012-10-23 00:28:48
It is quite difficult to convert pesos to other currencies (bitcoin included) without paying a high premium. The thing is that nobody really want to hold pesos due to the inflation. 
However there is an unexplored market for expats living in Argentina. A lot of expats are currently getting their pesos from ATMs and if they instead had bitcoins they would gain 25% on the exchange rate.

Listen to the tune here: 
We will be happy if someone would put some voice on top of it! Otherwise you can use it for anything Bitcoin related.

Big up for your comment! And I hope you are fine with that we reposted this on our FB page.

Used the service and it works great!
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:42:30
In a country with 25-30% inflation and monetary restrictions it's not difficult for the argentines to recognize the merits of Bitcoins. Filming how argentines are using Bitcoins will only help spread the word of Bitcoins (no matter the quality of the film) and will give a first hand idea of how Bitcoins are actually used.

 Ok, thanks for the link, I wasn't aware of bitcoinbounties.com and I'm glad that CrowdCurity are not the only ones doing bitcoins for bug-hunting.
@_date: 2013-06-16 17:28:28
6 monts ago we filmed this short documentary about Bitcoins in Argentina.. with the latest move from Western Union I expect that these type of transactions will become more common. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 11:35:51
I think the important point here is that bitcoin greatly reduces the barriers to entry and lowers the cost for accepting payments online. 
Bitcoins opens the market for small farmers to ask for payment services not only from big banks or paypall - but from thousands of independent bitcoin businesses.
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:49:37
Agree, the title might be misleading. Should have been something like "BitcoinFilm theme song for 'Bitcoins in Argentina' now available for use and reuse".
Seems like I cannot update the submission here at reddit, but I have updated the title in bitcointalk forum and also youtube.

Thanks for your comment. For many small and medium sized businesses it can be a hassle getting up and running with a Vulnerability Reward Program and market the program towards testers. The result is that too few businesses are taking advantage of the crowd. CrowdCurity will be helping those online businesses, and the fee we charge is well spent in terms of the benefits of reaching out to the crowd. 
From the testers point of view we offer a one-stop for Vulnerability Reward Programs and we help structure the process around submitting vulnerabilities and receiving the reward. Furthermore I am not aware of any bug-bounty programs out there where testers can get paid in Bitcoins, which we will facilitate.

Big up for your effort!! Real Bitcoin buttom-up collaboration :)
We have added your revised subtitles to the movie! 
@_date: 2013-06-29 18:59:26
Well, I'm having troubles believing that. I would expect any legit business to respond to scam accusations.. and so far I have had no feedback from  - it should be easy for them to either return the money or defend that they are not scamming.

 Jacob lives in Argentina and uses his pesos for groceries and everyday stuff. The alternative to selling bitcoins is to bring in dollars in cash and sell those. 
This blog post I wrote some time ago explains this in more detail:

 Our goal is to make many short docs around bitcoins between 5-10 minutes. This was our second film. The first one you can see at our site:
