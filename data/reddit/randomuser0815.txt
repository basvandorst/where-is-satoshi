This guy is a bat not a rat. Pay attention.

I'm trading on Bitcoin.de as well. The Bitcoin dropped from 15,5k€ to 13.99k€ last night. The volume that swapped hands at the low mark was negligible and we are already back up at 14.8k€. Bitcoin transaction speeds make arbitrage buys to risky especially if you are a hodler.
But I did cash out on the bcash high last night. Poor fools believing in it.

I sold the bcash on Bitcoin.de for about 2200€

I sure hope so. What does this world expect me to do? Work till I drop dead?

They will. If you don't care about time. I never had a reject. I always send without fee and the longest it ever took was 48h.

What is your annual budget for Exotica?
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:08:13
You might be right on both if you stay sufficiently vague

Nothing wrong with monoculture

watch him leaving the interview and it will make sense.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:06:42
What are you talking about?

This can be super dumb advice when done with a smart phone which sends the key online to a search engine ect.
If I was a google employee I would check all 12 word searches made by safari on iPhone.

Who cares. I own exactly the same amount of both. All long time hodlers do

Normally you throw your passport away when travelling from Morocco to Spain

Has anyone heard of bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:56:59
you really think someone is going to pay you that much for your bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:49:15
I received mine free as well. Sold it to some fools.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:23:32
Unlikely. Except if it was bought used. You can be as rich as you want at Ferrari you are going to sit on the waiting list for quite some time.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:32:31
Because of his annual budget for Exoticas.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:05:46
Just hang in there. It will work out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:47:22
It's already rising again.
