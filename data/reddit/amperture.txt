Think of the merchants that accept On-Chain bitcoin now. How many of them just open up a wallet to check manually? Not many. Majority of them still use payment processors like BitPay, BitcoinPay, Blockonomics, etc.
This will be the on-ramp of Lightning just like onchain TX for Bitcoin is the same way. A payment processor will emerge that enables both On-chain and LN payments as their major selling point. There's not even really any reason it couldn't be BitPay or Coinbase themselves!
Once Lightning has been thoroughly established via payment processors, home-spun lightning wallets will have the volume necessary for merchants to accept it manually.

I was under the impression that channel rebalancing was not part of the featureset yet. 
Did this change recently? Before I was cautiously optimistic, but if channel rebalancing has been found out and implemented I'm a little more excited.

They're comparable in that CPFP is not explicitly a software feature of bitcoin, it's a non-automated (for lack of a better term) action that users can take to mitigate the problem of a stuck transaction. In the same way, that channel rebalancing hypothetical is a non-automated action that users can take to mitigate the problem of having a channel that you can't spend coins out of.

So, what you're saying, and I'm drawing up a hypothetical.
* Alice and Bob have a channel open where 30 mBTC belongs to Bob, 0 to Alice. Carol exists on the same network, but does not have a direct channel.
* Alice and Carol can privately agree to the following: Alice sends 20 mBTC to Carol on-chain, and Carol sends 20 mBTC to Alice's Lightning Node.
* The Alice-Bob channel will then have 20 mBTC belonging to Alice, 10 mBTC belonging to Bob (before adjusting for routing fees).
To me that's not a "software feature" of the Lightning Network as the infographic implies.
That's just like CPFP, something humans can do to mitigate LN's (or in CPFP's case, on-chain BTC) limitations.

Unless you're working for the military, you don't have a huge group of people who desperately want your plane to crash.
There's not hundreds upon thousands of people trying to cut cables and sabotage pulleys on your elevators daily.
With computer software, unless it's airgapped and totally non-networked, you don't exactly have the wear and tear of time the way you do with elevators, planes, or most other goods that can theoretically endanger a human life, but what you do have is a constant barrage from a large group of people who actively want your software to fail because when it does, they benefit.

"actual bitcoin transactions" is a bit of a weird term in this context.
While, yes, they are transactions that are signed, they are unpublished.
Even as awesome as the technology seems to be and what it will enable, I find it hard to justify calling any Bitcoin "my" bitcoin unless the blockchain itself says it's on an address I have the private key to, hence it's "deposited" to a channel and can be "withdrawn" by redeeming those transactions.
The cryptographic proof part of your statement makes the idea work better, but hey.

Yes. Though as an aside, Electrum wallet servers also publish a "support/donation address" when you connect to them, if you use an Electrum wallet, all of which I'm pretty sure are also full-nodes, haven't looked into that though.

As much as this idea seems a decent way to avoid miner fees, I think it'd be much better to accept that measured-in-satoshis tips probably aren't viable (especially not until Schnorr sigs).
I once brainstormed up a reddit tip bot that uses some of the ideas and tech from this, but instead of keeping system-wide IOU's it just mandates all tips to be on-chain, and assumes all tips will be measured in mBTC.
In fact it would work largely the same as my Twitch tip service. I eventually decided against implementing either of my Reddit tip concepts for various reasons.

This isn't exactly related specifically to MiniTip, but I feel compelled to address it as I'm actively developing a tipping service that uses on-chain.
I disagree with this. *Micro*tipping (uBTC- or Satoshi-scale tipping) isn't suited for on-chain but everything I've seen on, say, Twitch tells me on-chain should work just fine if we accept that tips should be in mBTC scale.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:38:55
That battle was already fought actually. Streamlabs was allowing people to tip via PayPal, and Twitch wasn't seeing any of that revenue. In response Twitch developed their own tipping system--[Cheering]( reserved it to Partnered streamers only. Streamlabs still operates just as it ever did. Hell even a lot of Partnered streamers prefer Streamlabs to Cheering from what I understand.
Funny aside, Twitch decided to name their internal Cheering funnymunny "bits". No relation to BTC whatsoever.
I do have another goal, and that's to make it self-hostable. Any user could theoretically just [download the source code]( (MIT license) and run it on a $5/mo Digital Ocean droplet. Even if they wanted to take me down, there's not a lot they could do to CoinJerk.
StreamLabs could theoretically be unhappy. However, I won't name names, but I've heard whispers that they're perfectly fine with it, since they don't exactly collect revenue in that manner anyway, and it could serve as a pressure release valve for the demand for BTC support that is there. I imagine right now is enough to be annoying for support staff, but not enough to dedicate resources to. 
The only thing I think that could damage CoinJerk really is the potential for StreamLabs or Twitch to take the CoinJerk code wholesale and just use it themselves. If that happens though I'll be perfectly happy to let it happen, because it lets streamers accept tips without going through the banking system. I may be slightly upset if they don't give me some kind of credit (or compensation for my broke ass) for the work I did, but that's how these things go.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:21:51
So Twitch itself has created an entire cottage industry for lack of better term. There are a number of Twitch streamers who stream to make a living, full-time.
They do this by accepting tips through PayPal/CC and have software packages like Streamlabs that will pop up thanking messages in the video feed. It's a whole thing that's hard to explain. Just watch any random Twitch feed long enough and you'll see examples. 
Check out [this]( video, because it's hilarious aside from the example, but note the bottom left, they have a "Donation Goal" to pay for their cat's tooth operation, and occasionally you'll see donation messages show up in the bottom right. That's Streamlabs.
This doesn't come without downsides though.
Twitch/Streamlabs have shined a light on weaknesses of PayPal and Credit Cards as a means of paying tips to a streamer, most notably of them are the "chargeback scam" (this post is already long winded, ask for explanation if you're curious) and the fact that PayPal can hold your money.
I started looking at Bitcoin and realized, if done right, every single problem with Paypal as a Twitch tip payment processor vaporizes into thin air.
Hence CoinJerk.
It hooks into the Streamlabs API so you can do all the notification things, like leave messages for streamers and have a funny gif and sound play when you leave a tip --or you can have the whole stream go crazy like some streamers like Psynaps, see [this]( video for an example of CoinJerk working (At the time it was called CoinStream), while letting streamers accept tips **directly into their personal BTC wallet**.
Here's what I think of the needs CoinJerk can fill in certain markets:
* It creates an avenue for people to acquire cryptocurrency if they're wary of the usual methods (LocalBitcoins + KYC/AML compliant Exchanges)
* It creates an avenue for Twitch streamers to receive tips that is completely invulnerable to the chargeback scam
* It allows people who were using StreamTip to receive Bitcoins in a wallet without relying on CoinBase (CoinJerk is theoretically compatible with any BIP39/44 compliant HD-wallet, as well as Electrum wallets)
* It allows old ChangeTip users to accept Bitcoin again, as well as accept them in a way that works with Streamlabs notification features.

If we're to use this thread for self promotion, as evidenced by the top comment, then I'll say what I'm working on. 
I have a working prototype for a system for Twitch streamers to accept bitcoin tips and hooks into their Streamlabs notification system. I've got a few users already in a private beta test, and am trying to raise some money to gear up the server where I'd be comfortable doing a public release, which I'm fairly certain it couldn't handle now, just yet.

I might start converting [CoinJerk]( to use this. I haven't looked at the code quite yet, but I will soon. Some questions if you don't mind answering before I go find out myself
* Can't quite tell from documentation, but can bit generate addresses from an xpub key 
* What are the mechanics of checking balance? Are you checking the blockchain or using an API? Is there an expectation to have a known full-node nearby?
* Are the exchanges configurable for finding exchange rate? Given that GDAX, Bitstamp, Bitfenix, etc. are all separate sources of exchange rate, it may be useful as a function for my purposes.
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:30:26
I hate to say this, but if Bitcoin requires people taking _any_ action out of "patriotic duty" to keep functioning, then it doesn't deserve to function.

I also see a lack of a deposit command, allow me to share the ideas I toyed with:
* Use an HD wallet internally, and for each deposit command, give the user an "empty" address. Check in X minutes if a TX has hit the mempool, move that address into "waiting for confirmation" pool. Once it confirms, add funds to their account. Let the user know they have a time limit before that address gets freed up to use as a deposit address so someone can't spam deposit requests making the next legitimate deposit some 40-50 addresses down from the last one.
* Doesn't require HD wallets. Give the depositor an address, then ask them to present a TXID, and a crypto-signed message from one of the Input addresses.

In order to explain the blockchain as a ledger, I came up with an analogy related to writing checks, then layered several ideas on top of it.
First, imagine Billy wants to write Jimmy a check for $50 do buy a...Nintendo 2DS. How does Jimmy know for certain that Billy's check won't bounce? That is, before trying to deposit?
What if Billy staples to his check to Jimmy, the previous check, uncashed, that Billy got from Amanda for $75 (And consequently, Billy also writes a check for $25 to himself with the same conditions).
So how do you make sure Amanda's check doesn't bounce? Same rules apply, staple an old check to Amanda's check. And you repeat this thought process over and over until you reach the Mint.
Of course, at some point the binder of checks becomes too big to realistically carry or verify. But what if the whole process was digital? You still have the same security, but without all the dead trees. Enter Bitcoin's Blockchain tech.
See, most banks treat your balance as a transaction sheet as a generic in and generic out, not Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, I'm not just sending you some generic amount of 5 mBTC, I'm sending you, specifically, the 2.5 mBTC I got as change from the coffee shop down the road, plus the 1.5 mBTC that I got as a tip on my Twitch stream using Coinstream,  plus the 1 mBTC that's leftover from the last time I converted from fiat on LocalBitcoins.
I feel like it's sloppy, and could be refined, but that's what I got.

This actually seems rather simple to me.
As far as centralization. I tried to poll a few months ago on opinions regarding a bot that wouldn't actually hold bitcoins itself, but would just be a communication channel that would facilitate people directly sending BTC to each other (per Andreas' "If you control the keys..." soundbyte). The basic idea would be that in order to register for the bot, you would upload an xpub key from a brand new Mycelium/Electrum/Copay/breadwallet/etc. wallet.
Popular opinion [seemed to indicate]( that people would be willing to sacrifice some centralization for convenience as well as avoidance of miner fees.
So it still is in the planning stages, but I feel like it's still doable. And idea for handling TX Fees seems pretty reasonable. It'd take some work to convey the idea that I'm deducting future miner fees from your deposits and withdrawls, but hey, that's how miner fees go.

So unfortunately I have to disagree that Lightning Network is good for a tipping economy any larger than uBTC-scale.
It does remove the lower bound for sending tips, but it creates an upper-bound for transactions as someone receiving money cannot receive an amount of money larger than already pre-existing in a channel.
I suppose for reddit that's fine, but take for example the MiniTip bot for example. Look at [this tip]( for example. For reddit it's rare sure, but let's move to Twitch, where people literally make a living off of tips, and larger tips (Say, &gt;$100 USD) happen quite often on the platform.
GRANTED: I'll give you that my understanding of LN isn't 100% solid but everything I've looked into leads me to believe this is the case, and as a developer building [a Tipping platform for Twitch using Bitcoin]( (__EDIT__: *Yes, all the links on the page are disabled. This is because I don't feel CoinJerk is ready for public release yet. That said it is in working prototype. Get ahold of me if interested.*), it's this very reason I found Lightning Network unsuitable for the platform. I'll be more than happy to start researching and implementing LN if someone can present a stronger case for it.

* All tips go directly to the streamer's BIP39/44 compatible wallet (currently testing to work for AndroidElectrum, Mycelium, CoPay, Desktop Electrum, and Ledger Nano S...I know theoretically they should all work, but I don't like not knowing for sure)

Be careful about this one.
I went over this awhile back with some friends online. We all had to admit to ourselves that Bitcoin, as a culture unto itself, has some of the most impenetrable vocabulary fuckin' ever.
"Address" is fine, we should all at least be familiar enough with email addresses as a concept to get through that one.
Small example. Keep in mind I'm a full bitcoiner now so I know what's up here, but imagine someone new to all this:
* Public Key
* Public Address
* Private Key
* Master/Extended Public/Private Key
* Master Seed
All of them distinct concepts, most of them will be random strings of gobbledygook (For good reason of course, but someone looking at their Mycelium or Copay app and seeing 1Eyty8rRDHTNdZ8wf74kTLiuCYiqMRc5D6 on their screen in plain text is going to think they downloaded a virus.) and in no way is going to understand which of these is important to keep secret and which of these is important to give out.
That said it is pretty funny. Reminds me of:

I suppose I can give an option to "reject" tips, especially for redditors not registered to the bot. Anything rejected could either be returned to the tipper, or donated to the bot.
Not sure what you mean by "mis-spent", but I feel like invalid tips should be returned to the tippers for ethics reasons.

It's been awhile since I double-checked which library worked for me after trying like 10, but I'm pretty sure it's pybitcointools connected to blockchainDOTinfo and libpybitcoin for address generation.

There's a part of me that likes this idea. The core concern there is deciding on the activity time limit and reduction amount.
Same with keeping unclaimed tips, feels like an ethical issue, though I could just be paranoid.

Esepcially good to see that the answer to getting Lightning on phones is not to run lnd on the phone itself. 
The real answer is going to be using phones as a thin client for a node stored elsewhere.
Of course it comes with its own problems to answer -- best/cheapest way to get a dedicated node up and running, and a sufficient UI to give client credentials to -- but those aren't unsolvable problems.

Because the only way to accomplish a reasonably-convenient tip bot, without holding funds--that I can think of, anyway--would require the following:
* Every tip would need to be an on-chain transaction.
  * By extension, every tip would need to be charged miner fees.
  * Every tip would require at least two or three posts and for the tipper to dig out their wallet manually
* Every Registered User would need to upload an xpub key.
* Every tipee, for security purposes, would need the option to verify that the address given to the tipper is indeed an address that the tipee controls.
I was more than happy to build the bot I'm describing and did an [interest check]( several months ago, but it seems like there was no interest in that.
Believe you me, I would indeed prefer to build the bot as described, (and in fact it's almost exactly how my current Twitch tip tracker works) but it sounds like the market wants more convenience over security.
What I'll do is just strongly discourage anyone from having more than 10 mBTC in the bot wallet at a time.

This is probably the solution I'm most interested in with regard to the "always on" requirement for Lightning Network. Have your phone simply be a remote client connecting to the actual node on a server in your home or on a Digital Ocean or AWS instance.
I'm supremely thankful that it offers the option for the user to set up their own node as they see fit, and then use the android app to connect to it, giving the user complete key control.
However, the "Shango Cloud Node" option intrigues me. I know that the AWS instance is secure if you control it, but who controls it, and who pays for it? Amazon isn't giving out this service for free...Who is paying the bill here, and how is that value getting extracted out of my usage of this service?
@_date: 2016-12-05 11:07:56
Those are good questions! Wish I could answer them considering I only started really getting into Bitcoin as of a few months ago. (after the latest Andreas appearance on Rogan). 
They might well be good models to go off of. I'll have to look into them later. 
As an aside, would you (or anyone else, really) be opposed to the idea of a tip being a two-to-three step process? 
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:28:44
Problem is that ChangeTip was operating so many different platforms, plus a website, they had bots monitoring Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, G+, etc etc. And trying all of those as a profit-making venture.
I figure what my service could do different is primarily operate only via Reddit, no website, no Twitter, etc.
I don't have much of a concept of how much demand is on a server to run just a reddit bot. However, I'm willing to bet I can get it done on a $5/mo Digital Ocean droplet as long as the internal wallet isn't a full-node. And I'm not looking at it as a profit-venture, I can eat $5/mo as a cost.
If I can make profit on the side, that'll be cool, but I imagine any profit from whatever generation would be dwarfed by people sending me even the smallest of tips if the bot gains any popularity at all.

I was doing testing for an app I'm building by sending bitcoin to myself. I must have put like 30 transactions in the mempool a week ago. All with 10 sat/B. "Nah these'll never confirm."
They all did today. And here I am, probably five dollars poorer, with maybe 30 different UTXO's that are now in my wallet which will drive up my fees for my next big purchase.

I lost about...man I think it was $20 worth (Back when we were at $600/BTC) when I was dicking around with XPUBs and how to use them to generate addresses my first time, so I sent about $20 to m/0'/MAX_INT, needless to say most wallet software don't support scanning that far ahead and the funds never appeared in my wallet scanning software.
...you know I probably could go and manually get that private key now, if I knew which wallet I grabbed it from...fuck which wallet was that?

A lot of gamers tend to prefer refresh rate and response time over...pretty much any other feature like resolution, color reproduction, off-angle viewing, etc. But prioritizing those features is where LCD panels get expensive.
165 Hz is a little excessive IMO, but I love 144 Hz.
Combine that with the 1440p and 27" (huge for a PC monitor), and the big ugly ASUS ROG branding, and you get a price that I'm uncomfortable with, but I understand.
Probably the only people who are more demanding of monitor hardware and features than gamers would have to be photography/video editors.

$189 (USD) shipped, last time I checked their preorder page.
There's no way. Not when I can buy a phone on Swappa for less.
Here's what you do. Go buy a cheap Android phone on Swappa. Install Samourai, turn it on airplane mode and leave it on airplane mode.
Boom, you have a hardware wallet with the same security as a Trezor T, with a better screen and interface, but even cheaper.
I have no idea why these hardware wallet vendors think the way to go is more luxury hardware and higher prices. They should aim for a sub-$50 pricepoint. They could easily achieve the same security out of the device.

        - The BIP32 master keys of segwit wallets are serialized 
     using new version numbers. The new version numbers 
     encode the script type, and they result in the 
     following prefixes:
             * xpub/xprv : p2pkh or p2sh
             * ypub/yprv : p2wpkh-in-p2sh
             * Ypub/Yprv : p2wsh-in-p2sh
             * zpub/zprv : p2wpkh
             * Zpub/Zprv : p2wsh
Finally I can feel good about attempting to implement SegWit for CoinJerk!
Let's hope other wallets follow suit!

Oh, I see. I hadn't communicated well.
I wasn't thinking, at the time, of developing the live server as a large service with registered users being tipped. 
I was thinking of building it as a solo personal software project and didn't have plans of scaling for users.
That said, scaling it out as a proper service is certainly a direction it could go. For now I think I'd keep it as something only I'd use, but if there's demand or traction your ideas are certainly something that can be done, thank you.
Initial plan would have there be three components:
* A blockchain explorer (The Blockr API looks nice, but I'm exploring) to keep track of incoming donations.
* A donation server to give tippers a chance to give a message along with their tip, which would feed into...
* An IRC bot to give out notifications/thanks.
One of the core ideas, however, is actually giving up a _little_ bit of privacy for transparency's sake. If all inputs to--assuming I'm still using single-address--that address are trackable on the blockchain, one can't necessarily lie about his funds to viewers about how much he gets. In order to protect the funds, however, it's unlikely they would get a chance to stay in that wallet/address for too long.
Keep in mind, you mentioned you don't really know what I'm doing, and I'll admit _I_ don't really know what I'm doing. I'm basically playing the role of both engineer (or at least I will be once I start coding) and [idea guy]( at once in a one-man dev team. I'm using this reddit post, as well as other resources, as research into what's feasible for what I want out of the project.
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:14:32
I want to say approximately 5 on-chain transactions total are necessary to complete each trade. So those fees will depend on the mempool, and unfortunately Bisq doesn't support segwit yet (Their wallet library, BitcoinJ, hasn't added SegWit...), but while all the TX's in Bisq are automated except for the initial deposit, Bisq's internal fee-rating seems pretty aggressive on keeping fees low (most of the on-chains automated by Bisq were in the 10 sat/b range).
Apart from that there is a small "maker/taker" fee paid by each end of the trade, though I don't know who that goes to given that this exchange is supposed to be decentralized...
Maker paid 0.00004 BTC and Taker paid 0.0001 BTC for my latest buy.
If there's a dispute between traders that requires action from an arbitrator, the loser of the dispute loses their deposit as an arbitration fee.

It looks like I have a fundamental misunderstanding of how watch-only and HD wallets work.
My understanding is that a xpub key is necessary for a watch-only wallet, but that you in no way want to share your xpub key.
The core idea I'm thinking of is to properly exploit the public ledger/blockchain and make a tip ledger that is publicly verifiable. A sort of charity tip ledger that Joe Schmoe can go audit.
Is there an implementation that exists of a watch-only wallet that can be actually shared both publicly and safely?

A system to amortize transaction costs _with a single vendor_ exist. Lightning Network is a system to amortize transaction costs with _anyone_ who exists on the network, not merely the singular vendor you choose. 
You don't get to discount that microtransactions are a use-case for this network just because someone else does it in a centralized, inferior way. The use case is that this is a microtransaction platform that is superior in almost every metric to those existing systems.

Actually nevermind, I'll do the first part in public. Should give me a nice comment I can point to and say "Read this first before we get you started". Here's what I was _going to_ say in that PM: 
I'm not sure about your technical knowledge of bitcoin, so I'll give you the full spiel about wallet security and compatibility:
So first of all we need to make sure you have a wallet that's compatible with CoinJerk before you sign up. Unfortunately not all wallets work the same, and not all wallets are truly wallets (See Coinbase: Not a wallet, but a custodial account).
So let me get the suggestion you might not want to hear out of the way first. In my opinion the best wallets are hardware wallets that never touch the internet. I personally use a [Ledger Nano S]( and it is indeed the bitcoin wallet I have set up on my own Coinjerk tip page!
I understand spending ~$60 to $150 to set up a bitcoin wallet isn't the most appealing option, so generally your options from there will drill down to where you want to store your coins. Your Desktop, your Phone, or in a Chrome browser extension.
 in my opinion one of the premier experts [recommends using a phone]( you can crawl through his comment history for good bitcoin security practices.
When you get your wallet set up -- Remember to [write down your seed words and store them without showing anyone]( -- let me know and I'll walk you through signing up for CoinJerk.
OH also you'll need a Streamlabs account. Alerts are actually handled through Streamlabs.
Here are wallets I have indeed confirmed work with CoinJerk
* Hardware Tokens
  * Digital Bitbox
  * Ledger Nano S
* Android Apps
 * Mycelium
 * Copay
 * Electrum
* iPhone Apps
 * Copay
* Desktop software
 * Electrum
* Chrome browser extension 
 * Copay
Let me know once you have a compatible wallet set up.

Yes, you can only send Bitcoins via the Lightning Network to someone who is willing to accept Bitcoins via the Lightning Network.
You can only send Bitcoins on-chain to someone who is willing to accept Bitcoins on-chain.
You can only use Visa credit cards with someone who accepts Visa credit card transactions.
You can only transact with someone by handing them Mexican Pesos if they're willing to accept you handing them a fistful of Mexican Pesos. (Substitute US Dollar, Venezuelan Bolivar, Zimbabwe Dollar, etc.)

Oh no it's absolutely the place to ask! I'm just thankful the mod team let me post about my dev streams for coinjerk here. 
So the thing about CoinJerk right now is that it's an unfunded weekend warrior project of mine, and I haven't done a whole lot of webdev in my history (I'm more of an electronics design guy usually). So I'm not sure how comfortable I feel about letting it have a public release at this point.

Lightning Network 2o2's sound very reminiscent of buying a Gift Card for Jane's Super Dank Coffeestank, but it's a "Gift Card", except on this one the money can be withdrawn from the Gift Card pretty much freely, unless it has been spent.
It's interesting, I feel like there's vulnerabilities there with the idea of both parties having a nuclear option that would disadvantage smaller parties, but I'm willing to bet well-written wallet managers could mitigate that.
