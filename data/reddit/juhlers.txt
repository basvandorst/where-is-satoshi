I see your point, but then again there were indeed some beneficial factors about the gold standard, that could also seem attractive today. For instance the mechanism known as Hume's price-specie, which refers to the automatic restoration of a country's external balance. E.g. If prices are too high in a country -&gt; they lose competitiveness -&gt; less exports / more imports -&gt; gold flooding out of country -&gt; prices drop -&gt; competitiveness restored.
This is essentially a result of the impossible trinity, gold could be moved freely (a bit cumbersome though, which is a place where Bitcoin is superior) and the single currency created a universally fixed exchange rate regime. Since capital could move freely and exchange rates were fixed, it was impossible for countries to utilise monetaly policy (since noone could print gold).
There were some bad properties indeed, the main one (as far as I know) is that we had to rely on prices to do the 'rebalancing'. In other words the fluctuations in wages and prices came from long periods of recession and rising unemployment, poverty was rampant back then (and even worse during a recession). One of the places where monetary policy can be useful is to smooth out these kind of fluctuations.
But in the end, stating that a deflationary markets make a terrible currency is not strictly correct, there are both positive and negative properties of such a system. Atleast for what I know.

+1 - it's simple, really.
Dont be greedy, take out some profits, never invest more than you are comfortable with losing. Then you are all good.

Let me know how it goes. 
What do you plan on using for the card itself, I.e. where do you buy the steel?

If you plan on timing the market, then sure thing, go ahead and give it a go. 
But if you are just looking at the long run, then any investment at the peak of the booms you show, would have been outstanding investments (unless you daytraded in and out and foregone some of the profits ofcourse).

Sure thing, I have never head the argument of investing in ‘blocks ‘ as it was to increase average gains. :) It is just a way to reduce volatility.

You expressed that it made no difference. But if we can agree that it changes the ‘fluctuation’, then some people might prefer that lower risk of buying the top, hence it could be an advantage to some people (including myself).

Cheers mate, merry Christmas!

That’s not correct, buying in blocks will on average spread out your entry to the market, which reduces the chance for either entering at a bad or a good time. So it definitely has an effect, especially if you are risk averse (like 90% of all people).

As long as people still 'hodl' some bitcoint, it must be a sign that they believe it has long term investment potential, whether they have withdrawn some FIAT already is not really that relevant, noone should be investing their entire savings in Bitcoin (or any crypto for that matter).
The guy who just bought for $500 worth and the one that has sold everything but $500 of bitcoins left must (theoretically) be equally hopeful towards the future of the coin (if we assume that $500 is worth the same to both of them).

When will it go live?
