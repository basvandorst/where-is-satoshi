Given the size of current pools, I don't think it would take a ridiculous amount of computing power.  Assuming you start the branch close to when the checkpoint is set, you'll only have to slightly out-compute the main network.  The largest pools have gotten up to about a third of the total computation, so increasing that by a factor of four doesn't seem that outrageous.
You're probably right that it would be more economical to mine all the blocks, but bitcoiners would be able to see that coming and perhaps adjust the protocol around it.  The element of surprise would allow the attacker to come out of nowhere, cash out as quickly as possible, and crash the market by invalidating all transactions for the last six months.  Are you assuming that an attacker would care about the future of bitcoin?

Checkpoints seem to be set every 6 months, give or take.  If they guess well when the checkpoint will be, they may only have to make up a month of hashing time.  With 2% extra power, that would still take 50 months, but 20% would make it under the wire.  Again, that doesn't seem *that* infeasible.

I can't count to twenty, but I told my girlfriend.

That is potentially confusing for this argument.
If we're talking real numbers, yes.  But version numbers typically use a set of three non-negative integers.  There are more integers between 0 and 100 than between 1 and 100.
That said, you're absolutely right that it doesn't matter.  There just as many sets of three non-negative integers as there are sets of three non-negative integers where the first number is 0.
