Word is weird, it's some sort of convenience feature to help people move words around (so spaces are accounted for).  I noticed it happened once or twice in the past, and I undid it.  But I'm suspicious that this happened to my BTC passphrase, and I didn't notice when it occurred.

I don't follow.  There's no filesystem journalling enabled on my Win 10 system, and I store my password file in an encrypted drive is a VeraCrypt volume.

I was installing Linux at the same time on another PC of mine, with the intention of running a Ruby script I found here: 
While I was waiting for the install to finish, I was manually trying random variations of my passphrase.  I usually don't bother capitalizing words in my passphrase.  However, one in particular was a brand name, so it made sense that I recorded it as a capitalized word.  On a whim, I decided to try it without the capitalization.  Low and behold, it worked.
Had I got around to running the ruby script, it should have also found the correct passphrase (based on looking at the code).

Hey, you probably don't care, but I am excited and have to tell someone: I figured out the passphrase.  Turns out I had accidentally mis-recorded capitalization of the last word of my passphrase.  After I finished feeling stupid, I was determined to figure it out.  LOL.  Actually, I still feel stupid! :-D
Thanks again for taking the time to discuss this with me, and providing feedback.

Ah, you're quite right, based on what I originally wrote.  Here's more details: I use a Word doc for my passwords (stupid, I know), saved to an encrypted volume.  When I was copying and pasting the passphrase, I think I accidentally moved a word out of order in the Word doc.  If you double click on a word, it highlights that word.  If you then click and drag on that word, it moves the word to wherever the mouse moves.
Now you know the true scope of my silliness.  
My assumption is that I made one word move in the passphrase, and then "saved &amp; closed" the word doc.  Track changes is turned off in Word.
Going to move to a proper password manager. :(

Revalin on bitcointalk.org suggested a script for this type of situation:
single substitutions:
double substitutions:
I'll have to roll up my sleeves in order to customize the Ruby script for my purposes.

I appreciated your thoughts on the matter.
