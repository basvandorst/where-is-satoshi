You member june/july ? black market for gpus ? Because I do.
Asics are designed for one purpose solving 1 algorithm, their market is relatively small, and if someone really wants to attack on ASIC coins, they can always do their own RnD (we are talking about state level attacks), and build their own machines, it'll be way more cost effective that way.
Gpus on the other hand have many different usecases, mining isn't even the primary case. So it's much harder for a state or bank(s) to actually gather that many gpus without destroying the market.
But in both scenerios, actually mining coins while manipulating the market is way easier and profitable than trying to destroy the network.

As you said, block size increase requires hard fork. Hard forks are not a way to make money from thin air or divide the community, they are a way to upgrade the network.
When %99 of the people are complaining about tx fees and mempools and opt-in solutions are clearly not working right now, if there's a consensus around blocksize increase, people will follow.Bitcoin will have the block size increase, not bitcoin X or Bitcoin Shit.But also thinking there won't be people supporting the "old" fork, would be foolish. If bitcoin were to upgrade through hard fork, there'll be group of people who'll pump/shill the "bitcoin classic", for short term profit.

The whole world economy is debt based right now, It'll blow up at some point, it's not sustainable. What bitcoin does is, offers a solution against duplicates(the tech can be used to represnt shares of company, money or something else)  and a hedge against flawed system. While doing so pokes the bubble, fastens the process.
Before bitcoin, your best hedge would be gold and silver but even prices of these assets are manipulated by banks, central organizations with ious, paper golds.It's much more manageable "threat".You can't do that in bitcoin, what's the reason for someone to keep bitcoin in "bank", or exchange, when you can literally save it on a usb stick, or just memorize some words or string, and you are good to go, your brain is your safe.

A Nocoiner is a person who has no Bitcoin. Nocoiners (usually Socialists, Lawyers or MBA Economists ) are people who missed their opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a low price because they thought it was a scam, and who is now bitter at having missed out. The nocoiner takes out his or her bitterness on Bitcoin Hodlers, by constantly claiming that Bitcoin will crash, is a scam, is a bubble, or other types of easily refuted FUD. Nocoiners have little to no computer skills or imagination; even when they see the price of Bitcoin go up and its adoption spread they consider all Bitcoin users to be in a collective delusion, with only themselves as the ones who can see what is happening. This attitude comes from being steeped in the elitist priest cultures found at Harvard, Yale and Columbia, where anyone who is not part of their clique is treated with suspicion by default. The worst nocoiners are tenured academics and goldbugs. Nocoiners believe that the world owes them everything they want because they are part of an elite; they are hysterical liars, brats, prostitutes and losers.

I think it's better to look at percentages, at june btc lost %35 of it's value in 2 days (from 3000 to 1900 you can't really see these values because price reached these point for mere hours), then it went %45-50 up in one week(from 1900 to back to 2800) this movement keep happening for a month, and the last drop was about another ~%35 in 4 days (from 2400 to 1600). So 5k drop or in percentages about %25 in a matter of hours is quite normal for btc, what matters is where will it go after that.

Merchants don't give a fuck about bitcoin and it's price, it's a payment system for them like credit cards in 60s(?), and I don't know if you are aware but, most merchants are not very tech savy either. All they care is how much it will cost them to use bitcoin as a medium of exchange and will it bring more customers. If there's a service letting you pay with dogecoin, and gives merchant the fiat, merchant will use that service. They care even less about segwit, ln and all other technical shit. 
So; Once there is LN, there'll be people opening channels, and market their payment/lightning network. I can say, I'll reviece bitcoin payments for them and send them the usd daily, but it'll 2 cent per tx. Someone else can say, they'll make payments weekly but it'll cost them 0.5 cent per tx. At this point merchants will either go with the cheaper option, or "trusted" option. Whether channels are trustless or not doesn't matter.

You do understand bitcoin is not deflationary right ? It has inflation, predetermined, controlled. And yeah in 100 year or so there'll be no more inflation. 
The price increasing because more people are buying, whether to hedge themselves against their governments/central banks, maybe 
 they liked and want to support and be part of the tech, or pure greed. 
Bitcoin can redistribute the wealth, and even if only %10 of the worlds total wealth(~24 trillion $) passes from fiat to bitcoin, it'd put 1 btc over 1 million $. That's the long game.

Eth getting more and more pairings, so does ltc and even bch.Right now they don't suffer from the problems.For the majority what matters is now. That's why people are saying we passed the point of arguing whether 2mb blocks were necessary or not, btc needed that upgrade at least a month ago. 1 fucking upgrade would solve the short term scaling problems, kill bch forever, bleed ltc and similar coins to death.
Next year can be the fall of bitcoin, a real flippenning unless a real solution is implemented, and not an "optional" one like segwit.

Fees are getting higher because mempool is getting bigger, and to reduce to load on mempool you need bigger blocks. None of the current payments are for coffees, they are either between exchanges or exchange-user wallets + spams.Just people buying bitcoin made network unusable.
Yes spams will always be there as long as it's profitable for miners or other coins, but bigger blocks means they need more resources to fill the same % of blocks, even then the attack(lets say 2mb blocks) will make the attack half effective.
And what about mempool ? Can't bigger mempool also cause "node centralization" ?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:48:53
Because even if you implement LN and both segwit and LN are %100 adopted, 2mb blocks are still not enough to handle visa level transactions. To handle that volume blocks will need to be +100mb
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:43:40
You still need to open and close channels, unless there's %100 adoption, it won't fix everything, and until then it can actually bottleneck the network even more. Even then channels needs to be opened/closed time to time, which will result on absurd amount of fees(devs say this themselves).
So LN will actually work quite similar to banks, if it's not on chain, it works similar to crediting(that's why it can actually scale to visa level txs.). You'll need to pay a high fee for your active accounts every now and then, and then pay a low fee for transferring money. But wait, there's more. There needs to be LN nodes(possibly more central ones like exchange nodes), that'll have huge amounts of data traffic, and will need a lot of space to store that data, so running a Lightning Node is not something everyone can, it'll be mostly done by rich(er) individuals, or as I said exchanges, maybe even banks.

Merchants don't care about bitcoin as a store of value, but they value it as a medium of exchange; their perspective is "like credit cards, but with no initial payment to machines, less cuts and faster payments", most merchants were already using services like bitpay, not many of them really want to deal with recieve btc, send it to exhcange, cash out. So %99.9 of the merchants won't be opening a channel, they'd rather someone else to do it for them.
Now of course you can open a channel between you and the exchange, but what if exchange says, "We are not crediting accounts before we see the transactions on main chain" now you paid 2 tx fees to send your money to exchange.

That's what I meant by %100 adoption.There's no problem. The scenerio I'm thinking;
let's say over LN I recieved 0.1 btc, my balance is 0.1 over LN.If that information isn't broadcasted to core chain(because only then my balance on the ledger will change), and from what I understand I can't make core chain transactions. Now of course high fees are probably going to incentivize the use of LN,especially for micro payments but there'll be people refuse to use LN.
Another thing; Even if I want to use LN transactions, as far as I understand I still have to open at least one payment channel, and if the tx fees keep going up like this, even opening and closing a channel can very well cost 100s if not 1000s of usd(like transaction fees).
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:47:48
LN transactions are 0 conf right ? Maybe I'm thinking way too technical here but, for a trustless transaction to settle, you need (at least) 2-3 confirmation, and that won't happen unless it's on chain, or other people can also see/hold LN channel ledgers as a pseudo confirmation(I don't know whether this is possible or not, so I can use an answer).

I doubt they can track your swiss bank accounts and how much eur/chf you have. If regulations become too tight, people will just avoid using usd for transactions between counties.
So let's say you bought some btc with usd turn that into monero, turn it into chf and use swiss bank. Can IRS track that ?

How much can it effectively reduce the network load ? and how long until it's available ? Block size increase is a MUST, both right now and in the long term.Doesn't matter how many different networks you build around core or work on reducing the data size.
I'm not saying blocksizes should immediately be 100mb, I'm proposing what Adam Back offered 2 years ago. Keep working on solutions to reduce the datasize, and networks but as network gets clogged, short term solutions are needed, increase the blocksize.

Segwit is **optional**. You can't just propose something optional and then blame others for not using it. I'm not using bitcoin as a means of transfer until either segwit is adopted by major players, and I can see solid proof regarding low(er) tx fees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:38:45
Yeah watched the video, and it works if everyone uses LN(%100 adoption), it can solve scaling issue to a degree(there'll still be the issue of closing channels), but even if LN is released today, that may very well take few years, maybe even more.Until then LN is more likely to be used to batch txs together.It's still definitely a long term solution but, it won't solve much short term, even in mid term.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:19:03
You(or whoever manages the channel) still has to open and close the channels, and If it's not written on chain yet, it's not in merchants/receivers wallet, it's more like a credit.So there needs to be consistency of channels opening and closing, and most probably on a daily basis, if merchants were to adopt it.
Now who do you think average merchant will trust on the subject, banks/big institutions maybe like coinbase(if they run a LN) or an average bitcoin supporter ? I'm not against the solution but there are still problems that needs to be fixed.
Another issue; right now almost all of the tx's are either between exchanges or exchange-user wallet. There are almost no user-user txs. Exchanges probably won't be using LN when sending bitcoins back to you(it's more benefical to them, they keep the money in, and even if you want to take bitcoin off the exchange, they can overcharge you and blame the network), so there'll be still exchange-user txs + LN channel open/close tx's + spams. Spams will be there as long as it's profitable to miners, and best way to stop/lower spam is bigger blocks.

Now can merchant A finalize his/her transactions to the main chain without closing the LN ? or does it require merchant A B C D to reach a consensus close the network 
 then reopen a new one ?
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:03:21
You are still stuck with kyc policies of exchanges to convert your fiat to bitcoin and vice-versa. Of course if there's a hyper bitcoinization things can change drastically, but it won't happen with the current network, it's already cheaper to send it with swift, unless you are sending like 100k$+.

LN transactions are more like "crediting" bitcoin 1:1. LN as an idea quite good, I can't say anything against that, but it has inherent problems and actually won't solve the current scaling problems.
If you are running a business, you don't write every small transaction on a ledger, you write them on a daybook. LN has the similar structure if you look it from accounting perspective. Ledger here being the core chain, and LN will be the daybook.
But currently bitcoin's core chain doesn't suffer from daily payments, like buying coffee, or paying something online. It suffers from transactions between exchanges and exchange-user wallets.Less than %1 of payments are actually user to user. Which should be recorded on core chain(assuming you are not going to be sending to/recieve money from exchanges constantly).
Another thing which annoys me is, current devs and at least half of this sub really thinks going over 1mb blocks will suddenly "centralize" the network, meanwhile Lightning Network nodes will require some serious invesments, forget about average user running it, even most enthusiasts won't be able to run it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:55:00
It does, just a x2 increase means miners need to spam twice as much transactions, It's twice as hard to rise fees, it'll be 4 times harder for them to get return from full sized blocks.
I hate bch, but there was also some spam attacks to bch network, which failed horribly, because of the blocksizes.

 Btc is only useful to me right now as a market pairing to alts,like many others. I don't use bitcoin to convert my profits into fiat, most of my holdings are not even in bitcoin, because of the scaling issues. Honestly, if more coins get eth or ltc pairings, I'll dump all my bitcoin for them, at least until I can see a clear progress in bitcoin.

I took hefty profits too back in december/jan, my avg is closer to 14k. But I started buying a month or so ago again. Right now I'm also not sure whether it'll break 6k or not, but I plan to buy this week. As we all knew bull wouldn't last forever, neither the bear will.

Looking at graphs/past doesn't tell you the future, If you are sure about what will happen, take a position.So what do you think will happen now ? Drop lower or go higher ?
Whether you buy sell or hold, it always means you are taking a risk.But over the longer period holding always performs better, because of one simple fact; we don't know the future.
plus when you consider how volatile the crypto is, chances you'll catch dips and tops is way less likely than any other asset class. Don't forget this shit can go up/down a thousand $ in mere minutes.

Yeah thank god btc isn't deflationary, it's just unstable/unusable in both economic sense and scaling right now.
Let's hope scaling is going to be solved soon, and when it comes to volatile price; It won't grow forever. Or be as volatile as it is right now.

Why would paypal implement bitcoin to their systems? Bitcoin or blockchain disintermediates such services, whether it's a payment network or something else.
Let's say I'll sell you a product, if you pay me with paypal, they have a cut %5, %10 whatever. Or you can use bitcoin, only cost involved is transaction fee, when I'm selling the product I'll add the paypal cut to end price then I can say, "hey if you pay me bitcoin, It's %10 off". It benefits both parties and eliminates intermediaries.

People always talk about how people were able to mine bitcoin with their cpus back in the day(also as mentioned by satoshi in whitepaper). Whether btc is mined through asics or gpus, there will be centralization.So why not remove pow completely and change it to pos. People can finally mine with their cpus and btc gets rid of centralized miners.As satoshi envisioned, truly decentralized.

Bitcoin will eat its own dick ?
@_date: 2018-03-02 09:23:49
They can't. They literally need to raid your house, learn about your secret stash(or wherever you keep your private keys) and then they literally need to steal your keys to access your funds.
Not even north korea can access their citizens private keys if they happen to have some(unless they are tortured or give up willingly)
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:41:59
Because hitting someone with a wrench is equal to asking nicely, not a torture ?

Or, they don't know what blockchain is and just investing on magic internet money.
Don't get me wrong, at least 95 of the top 100 coins/tokens are worthless but finding the good ones for the long term requires intense research and knowledge. I doubt millennials want to do that.Especially after seeing the last alt boom.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:08:55
Why do they need to explain their crypto profits publicly ? Every person on that channel can invest by themselves, and unless someone digs that info, noone will find that out, nor there are regulations regarding that.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:38:54
I guess they bought enough, and now want to pump it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:46:28
They are not involved in insider deals, they are just the ultimade shillers or fudsters, depending on their holdings, there are no law I know of against that, so no need to look into it.

Nah, I bought my first bitcoins thanks to him, and now I'm ready to profit from his mistakes and eventual downfall.

There's another fork happened not too long ago, that doesn't involve segwit and have bigger blocks.And weird enough NYA signed days before the uasf, and barely activated before it.Turns out "miner support" doesn't mean shit when users decide it's an altcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:23:35
Don't they ?
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:26:15
In my country there are regulations too, but when you are rich and powerful enough, those laws don't mean shit. Here is the simplest, non crypto related one;
In Turkey housing market grew exponentially, since the US one "corrected". The mechanics aren't the same, we have higher interest rates, much lower incomes and way tighter regulations for banks. The market started correcting but if you open "business channels", right now, biggest sponsors of these channels are construction companies, and none of these channels talk negatively about market. They do "guest" some CEOs and ask questions, but as you can guess, noone will shit where they eat. So the channel or hosts aren't promoting market, but they are forced to do so, by others. You can say the same shit with crypto if not more. The regulations you are talking about doesn't apply on crypto either.

Then we started investing btc around the same time, I'm still invested in certain alts and honestly don't plan to sell them any time soon. If you jump from alt to alt, search for the next big thing, you'll lose eventually, or broke even in the best case scenerio. In crpyto market people get salty if they can't get %30 return(in btc) in a week, if they lose equal amount, oh boy, "xxx is a scam" posts are everywhere.
Sometimes I check /biz, and almost everyweek there are "rate my protfolio" with different(hyped) coins, you don't invest like that... Find few really good, not hyped coins with possible future, then invest , but don't expect to 10x in a week.
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:34:08
In the meantime I quadrupled my btc holdings.

Tether is a ticking time bomb, but it still has time. Plus we don't know whether it'll go boom, or it's just a dud.
Never used tether, and never will but market is still using tether, and sometimes even paying premium to do so.The ones use usd/eur or any other fiat won't get as much hurt as the ones using tether.So, if you are afraid of tether, just don't use it.
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:49:30
Probably charging less than whatever visa currently is charging, because of the infrastructure of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:46:24
I invested in btc then alts only recently at may, but there is literally 0 chance for btc to die, and everyday it's only getting stronger, price can flucuate,it's a low probability but prcie can go down %70-80 if something "big" happens, but it will still be temporary.
The reason is btc survived 2014.Biggest exchange is "hacked", china "banned", biggest market taken down(silkroad), infastructure couldn't handle all the transactions.No volume for traders, no "products" to buy,  but all the hodlers/devs see was "oh, so we need a lot of work to do".Noone involved in bitcoins core left the project because of these reasons,they all see current bitcoin is beta, it's not "released" yet.
@_date: 2017-05-15 18:24:42
It's a start.

I did buy the dip, thanks wannacry!(its not 300$ dip, but its still something)
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:40:16
Even if bitcoin is accepted by the governments as a form of global currency, its price will go up.But because of the way it is(dealing with fractions all the time), and being volatile, most of the population won't accept it/use it as a currency, it will be treated as an asset(can replace gold entirely in the future, at least that's what I'm predicting).
Example; You can buy a house using gold, or countries make their trades using gold,instead of usd/eur. I don't think anyone is going to say no to that, but if you go to grocery store and try to pay with gold, not many is going to accept it,most wouldn't want to deal with the process.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:13:38
Counting how much you have,paid, calculating is harder.When you say that, I can simply say/ask, why don't people use gold as currency(ounce/gr), you can trust a bank to keep it, and make your purchases from a card or use your phone to pay groceries with gold.So why people don't use gold as a currency ? 
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:48:10
Accepting bitcoin as a currency would make usd the take the biggest hit.It would hurt US a lot,not a big problem for others, yes. The other problem is 2nd and 3rd world countries, most governments in these countries are corrupt as fuck, people are uneducated and easily manipulated(in terms of money too).So governments can fix the exchance ratios, limit how much you can carry when travelling etc(most people dont realise the shitstorm their governments cause until its too late).But with bitcoin they can't control that, unless they remove the internet all together.One causes awareness among citizens, other option  can cause a bigger rebellion, even if it's possible.So both options are shit for them.
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:02:11
If it works for both nations, especially for the trades between both, then more countries may adopt bitcoin as a currency(korea,vietnam,philipines etc. maybe even china eventually) and if so It'd be the real rise of the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-19 06:17:33
That's why I was too scared to buy recently, but finally convinced myself to buy and hodl.

You don't need capitalism for that,you only education.To be honest, speaking theoretically,"true" anarchy is the only true freedom and independence, then again its not possible.The closest thing to that is direct democracy, like switzerland.
My "utopia" would be;
1)educated society(so that society can look upon subjects more objectively, and can research, less likely to get affected by propagandas)
2)Direct democracy like switzerland, so society will always have the last word,not just parliment, as those corrupt assholes we call politicans may not keep their promises.
3)have social market economy, like germany, that way there'll be free market, except in few fields, that are considered basic human right.Like health, education.

I'm not trying to find the person responsible of the poisoning, or get stuck in history,damage is done.I'm analyzing current situation, and coming up with more realistic scenerios.
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:30:07
Tech has been there for over a decade now, its just never been implemented.so either people at top are pretty stupid, or there are reasons for them to not change the current system.If they don't change the system using a known(since the invention of coins), physical, limited resource to currency, why would they use bitcoin? Now back to my original response, a government seeing bitcoin as an asset is a huge deal(it's a start and can cause a chain reactions from other countries,depending on how market will responds to this). maybe it will be more  valuable than gold at some point, maybe its never going to reach there.
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:55:29
I'm also waiting for an opportunity to get some bitcoin, but feels like its still a panic sell/buy.
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:42:34
I see it as a viable long term investment but, I'm also greedy.why buy 50 btc now when I may buy 60 in a month.I learned about bitcoin when I was in university, either 2009 or 2010, and as every smart freshman, I rather spent my limited money on other things.Finally I got some savings, but I try to get into btc in one of the riskier times(there's been lots of panic sell/buy right recently, price is changing way too much way too rapidly).
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:32:30
If I were to analyze bitcoin like I do stocks, It still didn't get it's "vertical line", it's starting to get more popular(mainly because of its price but market seems panicking a lot(happened in 1800-1600, started to happen now, at 2000).But it all happened in a freaking week.We may see 10k in august, and if we do, then I believe there'll be a line, that'll jump it's price to 50-60k in a month or so.
@_date: 2017-05-16 07:42:20
I follow bitcoin since 2011 but never did or plan a long term investment because of its pool.For bitcoin to replace all known currencies, everyone should have a grasp about how it works.You can't expect people to get used to trading/buying thing for lets say 0.0023 btc.From an average persons perspective, its too complicated, hard to follow(at least half of the world population will think that).Not to mention people mostly will avoid spending it untill most of the world starts using, as it will gain more and more value,So maybe buying a house will cost you 0.03 btc.Imagine doing groceries with it.(again from average person's perspective)
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:58:41
I'm extremely pessimistic about Turkey's future.Yes technically we are doing way better compared to past(90's, 80's and so on), but the reason we are doing still relatively well is mostly because of global advancements, not government policies.
Right now our government is doing exactly the same things what caused the 2008 crisis(or as economists say "correction") in U.S, and we can't just print money to pay our debts, so shittier days awaits.Due to their need to control younger generations, they build shitton of religious high schools and turned universities into businesses(you can literally buy a diploma),younger generations lack skills. And in most cases, you can get better wages as a techican or as a machine operator, compared to an engineer. 
Only recently they realised how hard they fucked up, and started promoting/supporting technical studies, but to be honest, it's kinda late for that, except few fields.All I can say is Energy is the biggest sector you can be part of right now, and if you can manage and learn blockchain, its uses cases will be the future, probably.
Now, about politics; as long as erdogan or anyone involved in politics currently controls the government, forget about moving forward.Even if CHP(giving as an example,as they are seen the most liberal/left wing) miraculously wins the presidential elections, if you think they will give up that power, you are too naive.Our nation have to suffer for a change to happen,I see no other way. and the best thing to do(at least from my perspective), buy and store bitcoin against incoming crisis.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:06:34
The problem with ideas like socialism, capitalism, communism, they all work great on theory, but when human factor comes to play, all of these ideas get corrupted.Right now, social market economy seems the best solution for the world.
Capitalism gave birth to bitcoin, because it's fucked up.So don't dream about "true" capitalism then criticize the people who wanted "true" socialism.
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:13:38
doesn't feel like bubble, there've been some panic sells, but that didn't burst the "bubble".
@_date: 2017-05-15 22:37:04
U.S is the least likely country to accept bitcoin as a payment system(beside probably eu), If US government accepts it as a currency, then there is literally no reason for any other country to do their trades using usd, when they can use bitcoin.It'd be suicide.Still, accepting it as a digital gold/asset is still something.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:50:13
Recent graduate here; right now can't find any job, so I have lots of "free time", had some savings(mostly used for going on vacations etc) it wasn't going anywhere useful, so I bought bitcoin.
I've only been in the market for a 
little longer than a month, so far didn't lose any money and actually made a bit(both in terms of btc and usd), did shitton of bad trades, caught in some fomos, did lots of research(both in terms of market/statistics and the products/coins) but finally found some good projects, learned a bit about movements.I believe it is possible to not "work", if you don't count researching,following news, discussions,market movements,making calculations, then making the right moves.I'm still a newbie, and I believe I have a lot more to learn.But instead of working for some company that won't give me what my worth is, I rather work like this.

Been following my countries investing.com's comment section for a month and I see people going through 5 stages of grief.
"bitcoin is ponzi sceme"
"why the fuck going up so fast, ,it's unrealistic.It's going to be worthless soon"
"can it go any higher? should I buy some bitcoins ?"
"Oh shit I bought them at 2700 and now its 2100, now I'm broke"
"I guess bitcoin is just volatile."

Best analysis, I rate 5/7.
