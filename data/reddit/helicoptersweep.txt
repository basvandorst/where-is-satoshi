Trading &amp; technical analysis is no joke. I watch trading videos often &amp; have learned a lot but am still super duper ignorant about many tools/indicators &amp; chart patterns that are commonly used.

By 2030 the govt may have found a way to attack or outlaw it or maybe just track down people who sell it &amp; make their lives miserable. If bitcoin goes to like 70k in the next couple years maybe you should sell 4 &amp; hodl the 1.

He's a bitcoin fanatic. I like him but it's the truth. 
Last week he posted on twitter that if Satoshi had invented Bitcoin 10 yrs earlier 9/11 would have never happened lol.

Would be crazy if that left translated cycle plays out &amp; bitcoin gets to 200k in a year &amp; a half or so.

Is this guy really a billionare? If so I dont mind hearing what he has to say.

You really dont see bitcoin following the same path as gold &amp; silver if another financial crisis happens? With prices initially dropping &amp; then skyrocketing afterwards?  I think it will do very well. Especially if we see another inflation cycle like the 70's which will make commodoties &amp; bitcoin very attractive.
I am not hoping for a financial crisis though. It would be terrible. But it's easy to see how shit could hit the fan &amp; what it could potentially do for the appeal of a deflationary asset like bitcoin.

Guys i think it says bitcoin is going down to $8500

I try,  &amp; between friends,work &amp; family nobody cares. Ain't nobody trying to learn about this crypto shit but me i guess. I think it's gonna take seeing me make some mega bucks for them to wise up &amp; understand. But by then they will have missed their window.

The seeds of the next recession were planted before Trump got elected but you get the feeling that he will do anything that helps his presidency be successful even if it means creating even bigger problems down the road.

The  public isnt fomo'ing yet.
 I can see a scenario where public fomo hits after we reach a new ath (which could be very soon) &amp; then bitcoin pumps up to an unstastainable high with a big crash following.
If the unstastainable high gets to like 100k I will sell some bitcoin. If it only gets up to around half that or less I will just hodl, wait for the crash &amp; buy more.

I've got 1.3 bitcoin. If it gets to the point where I can sell the 0.3 &amp; get like 20k I'll probably do it &amp; then save the rest until it's worth 200k or so.

I love the detail in this chart

Nice post. Scarcity is one of the key selling points I try to make when I explain bitcoin to people.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:58:31
Oh yes, I was just wondering why they would create a sign about bitcoin! A warning or something?
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:31:32
Police? They have a lot of big regulations over there no?

Bob's a guy who's opinion I regard very highly. Guy knows his stuff.

Krown says he expect the next move to happen around the 15th of this month which may end up being the same for this scenario.

I expect it would behave like gold &amp; silver. After the 2008 crash gold &amp; silver prices initially dropped along with just about everything else. After that they both went crazy high. For Bitcoin it'd probably be the same.
