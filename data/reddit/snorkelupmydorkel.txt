Coinbase trying to take over new markets when they don't have the balls to set their default unit to bits.
I remember when they were the leader not the follower.

Just wait until he's dying and see where bitcoin is by then.  On his deathbed whisper into his ear, "I told you so mother fucker.  Thanks for not believing in your own son."

I suspect ISIS is funded by Dick Cheney's pals.  Who the hell goes around video taping beheadings, purposefully trying to provoke those that could end them unless they WANT an invasion so someone can make some money.
In short, ISIS is actually funded by large American corporations and their Arab buddies that are going to make money on US military contracts and expansion in the area.
Cheney is just SO furious about all the lost revenue when we left.  
Fuck that place.  Let them behead everyone.  If America HAS to go to war, from now on we either LEVEL a place--short of nukes--and leave. 
We are the only country that must turn a land into a democracy, educate their grandchildren and establish retirement accounts for everyone before it is considered a win for us.
Americans pay more taxes than most modern countries and we don't even have healthcare to show for it. It's because these bastards are using all our taxes to make profits for their war corporations.

You will see less and less adoption.  As time goes by and you wonder why, this....this is why.
If bitcoin is not near universally traded in bits, it is simply going to die off.  Return to this post in several years and compare the results with the events.

We really should start telling people to get bits instead of bitcoin.
"Right now you can get a million bits for just 400 bucks."

I agree with Op.  I'd just add  that we MUST tip in bits.  We MUST make two digits to the right of the decimal the standard.
4.56

1- Bitcoin hanging around regardless  (This will always cause the biggest moves--Staying Power is HUGE)  
2- Slaying BearWhale  
3- Move to Bits (2 digits after decimal)  
4- Changetip going viral with bits

People are funny creatures.  It's not bitcoin...it's marketing.  That's all money truly is...marketing.  That's the thing the bitcoin space hasn't figured out how to do well yet.

People are idiots.  Their expected results time frame is far too short.  20 dollars 10 years ago bought more than double the amount of groceries today--10 years ago.
Come back in 10 years and see how much bitcoin is worth.

That exposure is so hot right now.
