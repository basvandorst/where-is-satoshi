Did you even read the article?
Where is the bitcoin error?
Click baiting Idiot
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:21:23
14 right here
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:38:21
Which time machine model do you have?
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:14:35
Yeah you should withdraw :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:33:35
Just payed 50$ fee, instant transfer :D

Same as your answer...
Thank you for your message. 
We are sorry to hear that you weren't able to pay your order from our website with bitcoin. When more customers experience the same problem with bitcoin we obviously will reconsider our bitcoin payment service provider in order to prevent this kind of situations in the future. 
Our apologies for the inconvenience and we hope to have informed you sufficiently. 
With kind regards, 
So I guess more users need to start paying with bitcoin and complaining :)
@_date: 2018-08-31 06:19:59
Just sent a complaint. Thank you for the advice!

Because f*** freedom?

@_date: 2017-11-02 14:03:56
But it’s important to do it without a sock
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:39:00
So that’s 20 million tx/s with 2 GB blocks?
...checks the math....
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:59:42
Mind explaining what the advantages are for bitcoin users? I’m not really familiar with it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:59:09
Yeah, but I’ll be putting more service on it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:00:24
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:03:35
Yes, I’m also planning another one in a different location :P
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:45:15
So it uses the same Blockchain data that bitcoind manages? If so I think I can afford to run Electron as well...
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:33:46
Exactly what I was thinking
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:59:18
You need to forward port 8333 from your router to the rig, also make sure firewall is not blocking 8333 on TCP.
You can apply bandwidth rules.
Assuming you’re already running bitcoind or bitcoin GUI without pruning

26 right now
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:10:27
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:12:16
No time for that :)
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:55:56
Makes sense
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:07:55
What ports did you open to the machine?
What os?
Did you check your firewall rules?
Did you have ACLs correctly setup?
What I usually find is that people leave the doors open for everyone...
Get rid of teamviewer, it’s closed source, nobody knows what issues it might have.
You can use VPN, ssh + two factor auth :)

You could be lucky and recover the file if it was a 'quick' format (without filling the disk with zeroes or random data).
Stop using the drive immediately and use a recovery tool to read the data.
I can recommend foremost and testdisk, if you're comfortable with cli.
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:40:05
So this is legal now?
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:23:23
Learning about it since the beginning and discarding it with "naaah this won't scale"
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:20:55
Kirov reporting
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:50:57
Wonder if they have a REST API 
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:07:59
Fuck off

Here’s a dummy implementation of the sell/buy logic:
bool shouldSell { return false; }
bool shouldBuy { return !shouldSell(); }
1. Compile code
2. Run hodl loop
3. Profit
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:09:22
Mind to ELI5 how GPU mining is related to this?
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:00:43
Of course I will if nobody answers ;)
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:26:17
I think this is the CEO of Bcash :D
