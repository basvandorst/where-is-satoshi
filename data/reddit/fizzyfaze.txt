Yeah I've read a lot or reviews about Havelock. I really like it because their interface is very simple to use. But the variety to invest in isn't nearly as much as btctc. I would eventually like to start using btctc but only after I know how to use it. Is bitfunder easier to use?

Lol couldn't agree more. But investing that btc in an exchange is what I meant. Sorry I should've been more clear.

Isn't that where all the fun is? I'm doing this for a learning experience and because I am really interested in all of it. If it plays out well than good stuff... Otherwise too bad. You live and learn right? But what do you mean by "risks above and beyond bitcoins itself?"
Edit: I know that bitcoin has been under quite a bit of fire lately... Are you reffering to this?

Yeah I would eventually like to be able To take advantage of the arbitrage but Im really looking for something that I could invest in that would yield a dividend as of right now. Eventually if it turns out successful, i would save up some more and throw it into my fund. As you guessed I only have a small amount to mess around with. I know Havelock sends you an email with every update that is made within the market such as IPOs etc... Where do I look for speculations and startups? Please feel free to correct me if I have it all twisted. Still trying to learn all of this.

Great ideas friends. I will definitely post an outline of the presentation after I have drafted it. Keep the ideas flowing!
@_date: 2013-07-12 19:20:34
Wow that sounds like what I'm looking for. So is Havelock sort of like coinbase or mtgox? Correct if I have it completely twisted....

Can't find the post button! Looking for the reply area.... Made an account

Thanks for the advice. I have thought about that. And long term storage will be stored on a personal external HDD. I would've never thought about encrypting that. Now I will make sure to. Thanks!
So just to be clear, coinbase is a wallet that I could keep my btc in and will be safe, correct? I won't have to transfer it anywhere else?
@_date: 2013-07-16 15:31:49
Ahhhhh I see. I likeeee
@_date: 2013-07-12 13:30:10
Yeah that's why I'm starting low. I Dont feel comfortable throwing in more money when I really have no idea what to expect. That's why I feel that 1 bitcoin is perfect. I've been reading about the exchanges and have seen prices vary greatly. I've been on btct.co and mtgox and saw the price variation. Please correct me if I'm taking the wrong approach.
Long term investing is definitely a goal I have. 
How would I go about transferring out of coinbase into a paper wallet?

Hmm sure why not. Sounds like fun.
@_date: 2013-07-12 15:12:41
Ahhhh. Okay that makes sense. I'll look into it. Still considering NY options on where to buy from. I'm leaning towards an online purchase as my first time. I've been looking at mtgox, btce, bitstamp and of course coinbase. Right now btce has the lowest price for them.

That's another the reason why I'm starting low. Broke college kid with only enough in my account to pay for 1 btc. I won't be investing all of it at one time. I couldn't agree more though. Btc is the way to go. Is there a way to buy using cash? Or is linking my account the only way to go?
@_date: 2013-07-12 14:17:00
Oh yeah I remember reading about that. But how can I be sure that these people are trustable? I Dont think there is a way to be 100% this person won't come up to me with a gun and take my money. Now that I think about it, it seems like a better idea to buy off of coinbase. 
Are you able to bargain with the locals selling the btcs?
@_date: 2013-07-16 15:26:20
On what?!
@_date: 2013-07-12 15:16:10
Yes this is true. That's one risk on willing to take. That's why I'm going small first. And I make sure to do extensive research before I buy. That's what allowed me to grow some balls and actually put into btcs.
@_date: 2013-07-12 15:17:37
Hmmmm. .5 seems like a hefty amount. I would have to do some research on it because this is the first time I'm really hearing about it. Are there any other investment firms like this that I could look into and compare?
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:24:42
You can talk about the different kinds of wallets and ways people could use their btcs. If you want you could mention different places people can purchase coins
@_date: 2013-07-16 14:40:38
Yeah I Dont want to trade currencies becayse I haven't read up on much else except ltc and btc. But which security reading site would you suggest?
