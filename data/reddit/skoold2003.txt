I used to listen to him a lot but now I'm not sure about him. First, he has a bit of a biased opinion since he is a gold dealer. Second, anyone who says that the market is going to crash will certainly be right eventually. It's like me saying you're gonna die some day.. I'm right but it doesn't make me a prophet.

There seems to be a lot of confusion about this. The government isn't afraid of onramps to the USD (like Apple pay) they're afraid of alternate currencies.

I'm pretty sure you can only deduct losses against your gains though.. Like gambling losses
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:57:09
Yup I think that's right.. seems unfair

Baby steps.. when Bugatti first?
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:08:31
So what do you suggest is the best way to convert to/from fiat/banks? I know the typical answer of get out of fiat completely but unfortunately that's not feasible right now. It seems like Coinbase is necessary evil but I'm all ears for a better method. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 01:48:09
My guess is that your a premature ejaculator? This would have been an awesome meme if the time was right... It is not the right time.

Isn't this similar to the lightening Network?

I can build you a site. As others have asked though.. do you have a crypto budget?
@_date: 2018-09-21 21:02:20
Yup I tried to pay with BTC at one of the restaurants there and they couldn't figure it out. Then I went to the BTM and they want a phone number so I skipped that. Finally I went to the gift shop and bought a postcard and a beer with BCH.

Haha ditto.. But then I usually go check CMC right after

I thought that the lightening nodes store transactions and eventually send them to the network as a batch. This to me seems like the nodes have to be trusted. Maybe I don't fully understand the concept yet though.
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:24:34
CNBC has a channel on Pluto.. I'm sure it'll be on there at some point

Thanks for the reply.
I guess my main question is whether it would be possible to restrict dominance of a pool entity in code? I realize that it's open source but still don't have enough understanding of mining/pools to answer this myself.
@_date: 2018-10-26 20:17:02
Yes I understand how that could be bad and that's part of what I was trying to find out. The only thing preventing it though, is the code changes not being approved on git right? Something like "if( mining\_pool &gt; .45 \* total\_hashpower )" is a fair change. Oversimplified though I'm sure..
@_date: 2018-10-15 20:15:08
Get him the ledger.. It's much cheaper and at least as good of a wallet as Trezor.
@_date: 2018-10-26 20:33:48
That's frustrating. It was a question applicable to either chain..
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:00:55
I think that making a conclusion with such little data is not wise. Just like everyone already saying that segwit is a failure because it hasn't immediately solved the fees/delay issue. It's to early to draw a conclusion about either.
@_date: 2018-10-26 20:19:27
This was more of a general question for either chain.. I just used BCH because it's the most clear example of the risk right now.
@_date: 2019-11-30 22:56:15
Gobble gobble.. hope I win!
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:26:15
Before you ban me can you tell me why this is a bad post? I'm not trying to be combative..
@_date: 2018-10-13 21:18:00
I agree. Gold sold off initially in the last crash then rallied. I think crypto will be similar.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:47:40
I'm glad we're all acting like adults here :)
@_date: 2018-10-27 07:01:37

@_date: 2017-08-24 18:53:22
I can tell you as a newcomer to crypto that my money is waiting for a pullback to buy. Also I bought BCH do to the possibility that it may steal some market share from BTC. It seems like there is a lot of passion on both sides but in reality it's yet to be seen which approach will prove more effective. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 20:22:23
Naa the ledger should be enough. I would suggest going to the ledger website and finding and approved reseller near you to buy from.
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:44:44
Go to GDAX and do a wire transfer. I transferred 20k and it only cost me $30 in fees
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:36:43
That's how I felt when trump won too!
@_date: 2019-08-31 00:19:56
Futures could be longs too though. Not everybody actually buys coins to go long..

Too bad, I'm considering accepting crypto for my car ��
@_date: 2019-02-07 08:26:53
It's because once the crash does happen he'll finally be right. Then he can claim that he predicted it just like he did in '08.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:53:04
This seems like a great use case for crypto.. but I don't think that every good use case should have it's own coin
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:43:48
I agree with you partially, but Apple didn't forego upgrading spinning disk hard drive capacity because SSDs were the future. As a platform you need to deal with current needs while you innovate for the future.
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:33:24
I think this is bad for XRP but good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:13:24

Pickled things last forever..
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:43:02
Also, if you're using coinbase (gdax) you should go the wire transfer route.. It's much cheaper and faster.
@_date: 2019-02-24 09:08:04
I see whatcha did there..

What about collect underpants?
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:28:35
GDAX.. same as coinbase but less fees
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:35:07
This adds a lot of extra accounting hassle right now because at some point you (or your boss) have to convert to fiat. In addition to the typical profit and loss the business has to keep track of you'll also have to account for the capital gain/loss of the currency itself. If we were at a point where everything can be done in crypto it may be more feasible. Even then though the government will expect capital gains to be calculated because it's considered intangible property. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:59:57
Speculation that the fork still might happen perhaps?
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:09:57
Same here.. it finally went through

Yes, we need to make crypto completely criminal free like the US dollars. Nobody does illegal things with US dollars..

Not yet.. Got some?
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:35:55
That's interesting.. I've actually bought lots of stuff with Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:40:02
I'm guessing this is the correct answer..
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:25:34
How the fuck can you seriously say that Bitcoin is a store of value right now?!?
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:50:48
Sssh.. if those people don't buy new cars I won't get a basically new $80k car for 50. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 09:14:25
Ya it's funny how this gets posted at the exact time that crypto has lost 80+% of it's value. I think it will come back but right now this post reads as "Look at that turd.. Got another turd?"
@_date: 2019-01-12 06:33:39
Good idea but I've never thought that satoshi was a good name for a currency unit. I like Iota's system because it's similar to how the metric system works. We should change the base unit to a bitcoin and just call a current (1,000,000 satoshi) unit a megabitcoin (MBTC).. that's got a nice ring to it. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 03:12:28
Kinit is what you're looking for. You earn kin for various activities (including trivia). It's in beta right now so you can't transfer the kin to an exchange/wallet but you can buy gift cards with it.

Isn't this pretty much what coinbase is aiming to do?
@_date: 2018-11-30 05:27:14
The cost will present itself as load on your engine. For example if you typically have to downshift on a 8% grade before mining you might have to downshift on a 5% grade now. These numbers are totally wrong I'm sure but you get the point. Good idea though..
@_date: 2017-10-07 21:59:11
Did I say something to offend you guy? Which part did I get wrong?
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:15:00

There's a lot more to consider in the dominance of the petro-dollar.. but I agree that China would view it as a possible disruptor to the USD dominance.

I agree.. This isn't a good way to progress crypto
@_date: 2017-10-07 21:12:16
Not the best analogy I know.. but the basic idea was:
- Blockchain is the underlying technology. Coins use it.
- Other coins are more useful than Bitcoin
- NEO took an idea from someone else and [might] make it better

No, the stock market is taking and crypto will fall with it.. At first. Then when people get scared of runaway inflation and/or a dollar collapse it will rally.
