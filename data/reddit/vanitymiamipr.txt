Lets not do this friend.
@_date: 2013-11-08 04:22:23
True enough. Still Reddit, where have you been all my life. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:07:32
no... I can relate with that Fernando.
@_date: 2013-11-08 04:19:37
What's an AMA?
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:08:04
Accepting one bitcoin payment just once as a publicity stunt is one thing, Institutionalizing Bitcoin as an official payment is another. I read the article, and its interesting ... so maybe I'm trying to split hairs. Don't let it get to you. I do see your point. They might have done the first bitcoin baby, but we are the first place in the world that officially accepts bitcoins as payment. And its also part of our price list. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 04:31:19
its cool my friend, you just need a better PR guy.  Na.. we're all cool here.
@_date: 2013-11-08 04:21:02
Thanks for the heads up, I proofread that article a billion times and I missed that one, also what is Lazlo's Chatterbox?

Not true, With TUBA implants you can buy upgrades without having to remove the implants, so in theory you could exponentially grow them . not recommended to get too big a size.

Its good that we are getting this exposure, but we are not spammers, and we pride ourselves in that. The articles that showed up here about what we were doing at Vanity Cosmetic Surgery were posted by the community and we simply posted this because we contacted the moderators at to verify the story and they told us that if we wanted to thank the community we could do so like this... The title , that was my Idea.

it was suppose to be a list of the prices for our surgeries in bitcoins, not images of tummy tuck, is something wrong with the link? 
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:17:40
We're very exited about this. I appreciate reddit's help in spreading the news out to the world. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 04:17:32
yea, its one of the procedures we do, I am not here to sell anything but if you wana check it out this is [Transumbilical breast Augmentation or TUBA](

That would be an interesting PR indeed. You know what, I'll do it. Its crazy enough to work. I mean everything I learned in marketing school has been useless in the face of this ever-changing internet market. They should have a whole subject on just Reddit behaviors and social patterns, should be interesting.

only for a few days, most people fear the surgery thinking they will be in bed for months but science has come very far. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 12:07:24
we do have a best results page you know. just boobs no faces lol.

From what I heard, There is nothing Fake about bitcoins, 
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:21:35
We have yet to decide this. Everything is happening so fast. We do know that a few of our providers for parts  and instruments are in Europe and might acceptBitcoins if we offer them the choice. The sky is the limit, we have a good feeling about Bitcoins. Its the future and we want to be the first to embrace it. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:26:22
I can prove it,... not sure if she'll be OK with it though. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:04:17
From Europe close to 30 new patients have already showed interest and requested more information about this payment with bitcoins in the 7-10 days we started this. The reason why we considered Bitcoins was because people from other countries could use them as a form of currency without having to switch to dollar. Plus it opened an unheard-of possibility for people who participate in bitcoin mining. We are super exited about the prospects of Bitcoins. At first we were in a "lets see how it goes" attitude but after such an amazing response we decided to go all out with bitcoins. Maybe other hospitals and clinics will catch on and imitate us. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:05:11
yea, but one thing is to do a transaction, but another is to officially accept it as a method of payment, aha...
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:28:13
Never, We do NOT show patient's faces and anything like that, its illegal and a violation of HIPA law. We respect our patients enough not to sink so low. You can look thru all our site and you will not find in the sample galleries the face of any of our patients, and the boobs that we do show they agreed to post them without showing faces. I know that it would be a huge publicity stunt, but we were not out to user reddit like that, we just simply wrote in to verify the information that was circulating and to thank the reddit community for sharing the articles. I did noticed the article showing the bitcoin baby, if that would have happened in the US that person could have been sued.
