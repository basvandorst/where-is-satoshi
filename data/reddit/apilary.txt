Bitcoiners want to spread Bitcoin, because we know that if [we all stand up]( we can take our freedom back from tyrants.  Our slavery is largely due to financial slavery.  As we try to get others to stand up, they perceive it as some type of scam, too good to be true.  They have lived under tyranny so long and do not realize the power they have as individuals.
If we all used Bitcoin, everyone in society would benefit except entrenched interests at the top who benefit from the current scam system.  This makes Bitcoiners want to evangelize.  Also, slaves who work in public sector jobs, and get their education from CNN, and Academia hate Bitcoin for its freedom, and the libertarian ideals that launched it from the dust.

Laws and rules are rather ambiguous.  There are numerous laws on the books, and any lawyer could make arguments that any man or woman is breaking numerous laws every day.  Its said that the average person commits 3 felonies per day and doesn't even know it.
What is more important is public perception.  In this instance, the public doesn't care about your Diablo tokens or other things.  However they do care about Bitcoin, especially government people, banks, entrenched interests.  They care about Bitcoin because it threatens their way of life.  Therefore there will be heavy penalties on Bitcoiners.  Change the public's opinion on the matter and the laws need not apply. The truth is Bitcoin is money, not property, and even the IRS statement is not a law passed by congress.  There is no guarantee that their "opinion" will stand up in court.

If you are going to buy a lot of bitcoin, get a [Trezor]( hardware wallet.  It keeps your coins safe from hackers and is easy to use for beginners.

Yep, I agree 100%, this is as absurd a post as the trolls who claim victory because the price is down in the last year.
