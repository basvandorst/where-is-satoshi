A couple of (crappy but seen-in-the-wild) examples:


Spit out some HTML:
    &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
    Here is your seed: &lt;?= $decrypted_seed_value?&gt;;
    &lt;!-- Spit out a tonne more html ---&gt;
    &lt;!-- This never executes due to MySQL connection contention, or overwork, or the page takes too long to generate or 5000 other things: --&gt;
    &lt;?php execute_some_sql_poorly('update seeds SET issued = TRUE where decrypted_seed_value = %s', $decrypted_seed_value); ?&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


    mt_srand(time());
time() is only accurate to the second, and any calls to it in the *same second* will return the *same values*.
@_date: 2015-06-29 12:21:18


Yeah, they're definitely hiding a bit of what happened there.
Reading between the lines, off the top of my head, I think there are a couple of likely possibilities:
1. Failing to destroy old seeds. After placing a bet, the page first displays the decrypted seed, and *then* marks it as destroyed. By throwing lots of traffic at the site, some of the pages spit out the decrypted seed *but don't manage to "destroy" it in the database*. Thus the attacker has a list of decrypted seeds that he can use again.
2. Poor random number generator. The attacker throws a tonne of traffic at the site and records all of the encrypted -&gt; decrypted seed pairs. The attacker then keeps refreshing the page until a previously-used seed is displayed, at which point the attacker knows whether the bet will be successful or not, and can work accordingly.
I'm kinda hoping that there's more to it than these - there are, for example, a number of potential pitfalls with generating the random numbers themselves - as either of these two would be *shockingly* poor. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:27:20


Oh sure - I was just going for the lowest-hanging fruit :)
(seriously - I've seen that one *way* too many times. Thankfully there's only been one time I've seen a dev use their phone number in the seed call...)
@_date: 2015-06-29 12:23:44
I've written below that I'm not necessarily convinced that this has to do with thread safety.
Given the "I personally had pretty limited coding experience," it could be as basic as leaving a database update at the bottom of the page, and enough requests resulting in the query never getting executed.
Granted, it would be an *impressively* shit level of coding if that did turn out to be the case.

How else can wake-on-lan work?
(i.e. the ability to start up your computer remotely by sending it a specific "magic packet")
For that matter, how else can you remotely monitor computers without such features existing in the first place?
Just because a feature exists doesn't mean its only use is for badness.

What this is all boiling down to is: why do you repeatedly call yourselves FCA regulated, when your company *isn't* regulated?


A word to wise: I'm pretty sure Bitstamp's team were just as confident when all hell was kicking off at MtGox.
Also, is it wise to compare your exchange to Bitstamp's, when both of your exchanges are run without any regulatory oversight?


I fear I didn't explain my point as well as I would have liked. For the avoidance of doubt: I agree that you shouldn't be renting office space :-)
All I'm saying is that for a company that keeps touting its bona fides, it seems weird to hide behind serviced addresses, since that's a tactic of many dodgy companies ;-)


YOU ARE NOT A REGULATED COMPANY!
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:01:31


Most likely because the guy doesn't know what he's talking about, confuses one set of features for another, and this has so little relevance to bitcoin that you might as well say "game over, let's go home, all computers are broken" if it were true.
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:21:11
*Well if someone figures out how to hack Bitcoin then they would have also broken this that and the other*
The real-world difference is that with *this, that* and the *other*, I get my money back.
With *bitcoin*, the money's gone forever.
Edit: I imagine that your friends are saying "hack" and mean "what's happens after my bitcoin details are stolen vs. my credit card details being stolen."
If bitcoin's *crypto* is broken, that means the end of public-key encryption, at which point we all might as well go home, kiss goodbye to our loved ones, and hole up in a bunker because the world at that point is *fucked*.

Q: I want to sell my coins *right now*, but there's a long queue of sellers *also* selling for $X. How can I sell my coins?
A: Jump to the front of the queue by selling for less (i.e. "below that").
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:14:56
My belief is that a big part of the problem, somewhat ironically, is that it's incredibly easy to program the bitcoin basics: sending; receiving; monitoring - they're all very very easy!
Since bitcoin is so incredibly easy to get started with, it leads to a false sense of ability in a programmer's skills.
Good programmers are damned hard to find, and if you think you've caught a good one thanks to them setting up a basic bitcoin service (and the programmers themselves subsequently think they're great), well, that quickly leads to the issues we've seen over the history of bitcoin.
Further, thanks to the lack of oversight required (and such things are damned difficult to implement *decently*), their lack of talent isn't exposed, and trying to do "difficult" stuff like proving balances, providing audits, and implementing multiple-signature transactions gets put off whilst they can concentrate on making pretty graphs update in real-time.
As I say though, this is very much only a part of the problem.

If all cryptography were suddenly broken... it's ridiculous to even think about fiat vs. crypto vs. bank credit vs fuckin' anything, frankly.
No way of verifying identity of computers, so no ID cards, bank cards, server-to-server communications etc. can be guaranteed. Cash machines emptying themselves would be the least of our issues.
No way of securing communications; anyone and everyone can read your messages in plain text.
bitcoin? Pah, *any* cryptocoin would be worth even less than the bits taking up the hard drive space.
Ironically enough, cash *would* have some value thanks to its physical security checks. If you need to barter and don't have crypto, you need something physical.
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:48:17


Why? Whether the code's written in Java or plain ol' 8086, the end result's the same.
Both are a step up from attempting to piece together microcode.
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:09:13


As a general rule, I agree with you. In practise though, I think this actually leads to a false sense of security. It's not unknown for open-source code to contain backdoors as well.
I'm sure I read about a contest for hiding backdoors in code a while ago, a bit like C obfuscation contests.
It's a difficult problem, and I wish I had the answer - probably be far richer if I did :-)
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:51:57


FWIW, open source on its own is no guarantee of security, as the heartbleed OpenSSL bug proved :(
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:19:31


It also doesn't help that some exchanges claim to be regulated when they're nothing of the sort.

*If* people are buying cheap coins, the price will remain low for as long as there are sellers willing to sell at a low price.

Why would someone *deliberately* pay more for coins than they had to?
Would you, right now, pay $1,000 for a coin? Of course not. Neither would someone with $1 MM. 
As long as there are sellers who want to sell at $X, the price will remain at $X.
Here's the fun part: if there are sellers who want to sell at $10 under $X, the price will continue to go down *despite people continuing to buy*.

i.e. someone who previously had full admin privileges to the machine.


One of the points of remote access is being able to disable or recover stolen hardware. If thieves can turn the protection off, that makes it entirely pointless to have in the first place.
Think of it in terms of modern smartphones being remotely wipeable; the feature's useless if the thief can just turn it off the moment they've stolen your phone.

I can get a *physical server* with 32GB ram, 2TB RAID, and 30TB transfer from Hetzner for 50 EUR/mo.
Remind me how much equivalent power'll cost on AWS?
Fact: I can rent many stupidly-powered servers for less than the equivalent in *single server* computing power on AWS.


Have you *any* experience of setting up something like this yourself?
I mean, I already know that the answer is "no," as creating infrastructure that supports spinning instances up and down is far harder than you're making it out to be. 


AWS is an incredible and powerful set of services and IT infrastructure; don't make it out be be easy, cheap, the be-all and end-all of web hosting.

I'm curious now - what's your personal experience with EB? 


Cost of labour is always a pain :)
I'm not convinced that the cost savings are there though; e.g. setting up reliable dev environments that support EB will also have a labour cost involved.
One thing I *am* interested in investigating further is docker images on EB. Last time I checked, containers were fully isolated, which'd make several of my use cases very painful.
The idea of being able to develop against the same docker images that are deployed to EB is, as a general idea, very attractive.

Charities are a *huge* fraud risk.
This is because they typically accept tiny donations, with minimal "buyer" details required.
OK, so why's this a problem? 
If you have a long list of stolen credit cards, you need to a quick way to verify that the card's active before otherwise wasting an opportunity to make a large (and fraudulent) purchase.
Making dollar-level donations quickly verifies that the stolen card works.
Now, PayPal is a huge anti-fraud engine that does payment processing on the side. (I'm only being semi-cheeky here ;))
It absolutely makes sense that sending tiny donations sets off pretty much well every Big Red "fraud is happening" Siren in PayPal's systems, and that's most likely why your account goes into shut-everything-the-fuck-down-now mode.
I can believe that certain names might also trigger their fraud checks. The small donation to charity seems by far the more likely explanation to me.
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:29:41


No. Just no.
If a seller can find buyers at a price *above* the current asking price, the asking price rises in turn.
If buyers can find a seller at a price *below* the current asking price, the asking price falls in turn.
How you can think that people buying BTC always results in a price drop is, frankly, beyond me.

No worries about being a ramble, that was a really useful comment - thanks! - and I'm just sorry that it's taken me so long to reply! :)
Interesting that you're gone all-in with docker for this. I've just in the last week started a push to move our dev environments to Dockerfiles, which has been surprisingly pain-free. I'm sure something'll come up to bite us in the backside as otherwise it's suspiciously easy so far ;)

And so the games with smoke and mirrors continue. What a shame.


Since you "are in close contact with the authorities," what do the FCA themselves say about your claims to be FCA regulated?
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:22:05


Didn't you mean to write that your *payment processor* is regulated with the FCA?
Edit: Also, why is the company name you have on your about page, "PAYCO FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD," listed as a non-trading company?
Edit II: Can you help fix my incompetence? I cannot for the life of me find any details in the FCA register for you, e.g. searching firm reference number 900088 / name payco on  What am I doing wrong?
Final edit: *And* you guys operate from an address-to-hire virtual office???
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:26:42


No. You have to put your money where your mouth is.
NB in *some* ways you could describe *desire* as helping to move the price.
For example, let's say that I've suffered a blow to the head and want to buy bitcoin right now.
The first seller I ask at $10 says no, as do all other sellers when I repeat my request at $50, $100, $200 and $300.
I crack open my second bottle of whisky, and make an offer at $5,000; the sellers have also been drinking, and refuse.
If no-one wants to sell, that means I have to increase my offer until they *will* sell, and that in turn is what we mean by pushing the price up.
Later, I tire of whisky and start honking on my crack pipe. I make an offer of $20,000 for a single lump of BTC, and thankfully, a single sober seller has arrived and accepts my offer.
The price of bitcoin has... gone up.
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:09:50

It's called Boingo, works worldwide, and is dead, dead cheap. This is a non-starter.

@_date: 2015-01-14 12:14:01


Create and report fake transactions to/from fake buyers and fake sellers.
Since the fake transactions aren't going to "real" users, they can drive the price in any direction they'd want.
It'd be easy to do poorly, and quite tricky to do well. And by "quite," I mean "very."
Personally, I'd be kinda surprised if there's not *some* manipulation already going on, for the simple reason that they have absolutely no incentive to remain honest, any many reasons to act dishonestly.
Pumping ~19,000 BTC in fake transactions though? That'd be shocking, but again - in an unregulated market, if you can turn a ~$5MM loss into a $2.5MM loss, why *wouldn't* you do it? Companies exist to make a profit, and it's still a few steps below what Enron were up to.
(admittedly, I imagine thinking "Hey, at least we're still not quite as bad as *Enron*" doesn't *exactly* ease one's conscience) 
@_date: 2015-01-05 13:02:23


Meaning that Yacuna is *not* directly FCA regulated, right?
Can you confirm that the only part of your operation that is FCA regulated is the one bit you have no direct control over?


I don't think anyone would take issue with a *real* correspondence address, as daunting as it might seem to have a director's real address on the company docs.
Do you think it gives the right impression when a financial company desperately trying to appear legit has a virtual address that can be used by any fly-by-night operation?

That's quite an editorialized title.
From the article, there are a few leaps between "promotes", or even "directly funds":

There are plenty of news reports indicate what was going on, for example:
"According to court documents, the agent told Michelhack that he wanted to use the Bitcoins to purchase stolen credit cards online. After that trust-building transaction, Michelhack allegedly agreed to handle a much larger deal: Converting $30,000 in cash into Bitcoins."
If it's true, that's pretty damning, and I really don't understand why people like this should be used as *good* representatives of bitcoin.
Out of interest, why do they need you to explain bitcoin? Isn't it a bit of a sideshow to the main guts of the case?
