No. This post is literally r/Bitcoin in a nutshell, it's kind of intriguing really. We (myself included) pick and pull the tidbits of info that we want to hear and try to somehow rationalize that arbitrary statement with a time frame and dollar amount that BTC will reach because of said statement. This single post has probably caused dozens/hundreds of people to spend some sort of money on BTC over the past hour and they probably did so without even clicking through to Twitter.

If you watched the video they clearly state they ARE behind dozens of other companies outside of BTC. BTC is just another investment for these guys and I'm honestly shocked at how poorly they explain BTC, their ETF, and the future of BTC. The WinkleBros are just rich daddys boys who paid their way into Harvard when they have no more intelligence than some kid with a two year degree from a community college. If these are the figure heads of BTC then I'm losing hope in the community and leadership. if you want to see a real leader in the start up space go watch an interview of Jack Dorsey or Elon Musk and you'll see why people want to follow those guys and have trust in their vision. The Winklebros are just frat bros who were lucky enough to throw a few million in BTC back in 2012. They have zero vision and won't do anything revolutionary to impact the growth of Crypto.

You can re-use an address as many times as you want... However, I agree this is a pointless list to create because an address can be changed whenever without any affect to the owner of a wallet so if you do manage to show up in this list as a "bad" address it doesn't do jack shit cause you can change to another address so easily.

That's super sketchy if your USD withdraw is limited. They essentially locked you in when you bought coins, and then limited your ability to sell those coins back for cash. This has to be illegal, especially on that $500 that was literally just deposited a few days before the withdraw was limited. 
Most likely this is just some shitty bug that their 'basic support reps' don't want to pass along to the Support Managers. On the very unlikely, (yet still possible) end of the spectrum they are running out of liquid cash or they are testing/performing 'damage control'. Damage Control would be to limit people from Buying/Selling during a large increase or decrease in price. I remember during the last major 'Bubble &amp; Burst' there were reports coming in that many Buyers would have their Coinbase purchase mysteriously cancel 3-4 days later after a large price increase took place from the time of their purchase. This effectively killed many Buyers who would have made a killing during the time coins were running up from $200-$400-$800 within a 2 week span. They blamed it on large exchange volume &amp; server overload, but I'm convinced it was some major damage control on their end. 
The same thing may be going on now! It could be a sign that a MAJOR change is about to come that they are preparing for.... Tinfoil hat buckled up tight ;)

Do you know how crypto keys work? Basically T Swift would have a huge database/list with every single one of her songs compiled in it. Each of these songs is then given a unique 'key' same as with each Bitcoin user having a unique Wallet key. When someone attempts to use a T Swift song on a YouTube video for instance the 'Key Checker' would check the 'Song Key' on the video and then attempt to authenticate that key to see if it matches the approved keys in the T Swift song database. If the key matches, the copyright is approved and the video can stay online, if the key doesn't match the video is removed for copyright violation. 
Basically you would need to have an approved/licensed/purchased 'Song Key' which would be included along with your song/video/commercial/movie/etc. wherever you try to upload it. If you try to upload any piece of material without a 'Song Key' or with an expired key that video is flagged/removed for copyright violation.
If you're familiar with PGP it's very similar.
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:37:19
Correct. As far as I know they don't know who made it or know if the original artist gives them permission to use it so they don't take it down unless requested by a Takedown Notice. YouTube and other video/audio hosting sites do have a 'sound analyzer' that scans the audio files and compares them to their database of 'pre-notified' songs/videos/audio files and if they match a song that is already in their pre-notified database they won't allow the file to upload. 
Basically a future Blockchain Technology would allow any artist the ability to use this 'auto-copyright' protection on their own accord and instantly without having to worry about sending out costly Takedown Notices to people using their artistic material without the proper rights.

That chart you sent doesn't account for being a large private company in China, it's only based on standard house hold rates. Chinese energy prices are in fact the cheapest in the world, If you're a private company in China using huge volumes of electricity  you can broker deals directly with the power companies. Any Bitcoin mining operation is the ideal client for a Chinese power company, after price negotiation the base price ends up being bare bones pricing, on average around 1.1 cents/Megajoule. On top of that many of the biggest Chinese mines actually have a monthly 'Cap' on the total they spend until the remaining electricity for the rest of the month is FREE! So lets take a company in the US that is spending $200,000 per month on electricity, on base cents/megajules alone the Chinese would only be paying 1/20th that rate on average, so $10k per month. That doesn't even include the max. monthly price cap which starts to come into play for the massive mines you see pictures of online. It starts to make financial sense at a certain mining operation size to literally fit as many miners into a building as you can because after you hit the $50-$100k max monthly cap, all electricity after that is 100% free! 
It's not some grand mystery as to why all the massive mines are in China, there aren't mines anywhere else in the world that can compare and its all about the electric costs being so cheap, not the miners being manufactured there you silly McGoose.

@_date: 2015-11-10 07:35:21
Your name is "BlockchainMan" yet you clearly don't understand the Blockchain or Bitcoin for that matter. Read the article on CoinDesk and you'll see that Cumberland Mining actually sent a tweet out with their exact wallet address that all their coins from the auctions have been sent to. If they simply created a new wallet address no one would have known this was them receiving the coins. We don't know who several of the other auction winners are because they decided to stay anonymous and use a new wallet address for their auction deposit. 
You should honestly change your Reddit username if you're going to go around talking about completely illegitimate concerns regarding BTC and the Blockchain itself. We don't need new Bitcoiners getting the wrong information from a guy who's username leads one to believe he understands the concepts of the BTC ecosystem.

Now that you've held them for more than a year you are taxed at a flat 20% capital gains tax on any profit you make from selling. This may vary and actually be lower than 20% (15%) depending on your personal tax rate for the year. I believe if you are taxed under the 25% tax rate personally then you only pay 15% on cap gains, but I'm not an accountant so take this with a grain of bits.

To be able to say you got in early enough to mine 21k coins is one thing but to say you had the balls to watch it rise and fall multiple times is another. I bet is one of maybe 5 people who has done this.
