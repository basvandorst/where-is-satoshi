When setting up a bitcoin wallet, you can choose a segwit wallet address or regular wallet address. There’s a bit of reading to do to learn what segwit is but basically it’s supposed to increase transaction speeds and lower fees. Coinbase does not universally use segwit addresses and sets it’s own fees so moving bitcoin from them is a waiting game if the mempool is backed up.

The devs for 2x alt-coin were a hostile takeover attempt. Separate from bitcoin and bitcoin classic. Many outlets fudge the names between the different types of bitcoin alts and it hurts the overall adoption. 
Bitcoin. “BTC”. The OG. developed by what is considered “bitcoin core”. 
Bitcoin Cash. Alt 
Bitcoin gold. Alt
Bitcoin 2x. Attempted dethroning, DOA. 
Bitcoin unlimited. Alt
Bitcoin classic. Alt. Shutting down. 
Even litecoin is a pretty closely related alt. Crypto is a web of forks and alts and mass adoption will take some time.

The email says nothing remotely close to that. It says
“Any user storing Bitcoin on Coinbase at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of the new Bitcoin2x asset on the Bitcoin2x blockchain. No action is required - we will automatically credit your account. If you have 5 Bitcoin stored on Coinbase before the fork, you will have 5 Bitcoin and 5 Bitcoin2x following the event.
Coinbase users will be able to trade both Bitcoin and Bitcoin2x shortly after the fork.
Coinbase will disable buys, sells, sends and receives for Bitcoin and Bitcoin2x approximately 24 hours before the fork. We will re-enable them following the fork once it’s safe to do so”

So where did his money go? Did someone on the other end make 85k before they decided to call off the fork?

Or stealing/abusing utilities. I love the justification when people here say “utilities included in rent, I can mine for free”. Which would be like having water included in the rent and then letting all the sinks run 24/7 because you feel you pay for that.

Splitting the coins, moving them safely to an exchange, and then cashing out, is a laundry list compared to simply getting credit on Gdax and dumping as soon as markets open. I see the appeal but still unsure if I want to do it. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:44:15
Haha, the amount of coins that have to move to budge the market is beyond what Reddit users hodl. Maybe if all of China was able to hop in again we would see the price shoot up faster and further.

When I was a teenager I threw 300 in and pulled out 400. Thought that was fun and let the profits sit as bitcoin. 
Fast forward to today and that profit is worth over 10x as much. Like everyone els I wish I just bought more back then. Being younger I didn’t really get it and didn’t really have the money. Most other people will pour their money down the drain on stupid purchases so bitcoin is one of the better things you can do with it in the meantime if you don’t need it for other stuff.

Set up an account on an exchange (Gemini or Coinbase) buy the amount you want. Then send the coins to a wallet like electrum or a hardware wallet like Ledger nano S or Trezor. 
If you keep your coins on an exchange, you’re trusting them to honor the amount of coins they owe you. If you keep our coins in a wallet you control, you’re trusting yourself to keep the private keys and recovery seed safe.

Okay that’s what I wanted to reaffirm. Right Now, segwit transactions aren’t taking up a major percentage of blocks. Around 10%. Is there a reason this number isn’t higher right now? Will segwit Be enforced if/when it reached 95% of transactions?

@_date: 2017-10-18 20:37:57

That’s it? I can’t even buy my lambo unless I own a whole coin?
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:13:10
So Bcash is a hard fork since you don’t have to worry about one transaction happening on another blockchain. 
Idk about Bgold but it supposedly has strong replay protection so it’s closer to a hard fork? 
A soft fork is where stuff gets messy and the 2X crew is purposely trying to use this to smother regular bitcoin transactions? Each side of the fork has the potential of people losing the coin they prefer, and only after the dust settles will a clear “winner” continue on as the main coin. 
Since alt coin is considered anything other than bitcoin, essentially the NYA is trying to bully the new coin as the “main coin” and make BTC considered an alt. 
There’s so much information I still have to learn about this. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:27:51
If anybody had the answer they could be a millionaire. 
If you buy when it’s down, theres always the chance it goes higher than before. 
It went from 1000 all time high to 500-600 for a few years. 
Imagine how lucky you would be now if you bought at that $1000 all time high. 
With numbers like 10,000 being passed around in murmurs, it’s anyone’s guess where we will be in a few years.

I’m not arguing. I can say that the price will rise 3% from right now, and there’s a chance it will, but there’s also a chance it won’t. You still have to trust yourself to be right at least 50% of the time. Just precautionary to anyone looking to trade.

You can use GDAX to get lower fees and it’s all tied into your coinbase account. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:36:44
Another good point is an exchange like Coinbase can feel like they simply won’t let you sell your forked coin. This is what happened with Bcash. If you are like me and had some bitcoin on coinbase, you now also have Bcash Hidden from you on coinbase. You might get access to them in January but they will be even less valuable than they are now. It would be easy for them to have made a few million selling off Bcash right after the fork when it was high, and are simply waiting to give everyone the much lower current market credit when they try to sell. 
Supposedly since coinbase is part of the NYA, they will try to support both BTC and B2X “within a few days, or maybe longer”. Their announcement was pretty vague though and they may not even be sure what’s going to happen yet.

Is bitcoin the “gold standard”?
That’s not saying it’s the best, because neither is actual gold. But if that’s just the accepted standard, it takes a lot to convince everyone it doesn’t have the value they want it to.
