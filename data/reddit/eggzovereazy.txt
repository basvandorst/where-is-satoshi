My interpretation of his tweet doesn't leave me believing he'll be doing a podcast on Bitcoin. He just said that *if* he does one, he knows who he'll talk to.

and because you guys are having fun and upvoting things, I'm seeing on my frontpage, thus made aware of the crash, and now I'm waiting for a further crash before I jump on board and FINALLY start investing in bitcoin.

I'm plenty patient, pending any personal financial disasters. If I can get a return like that, I'm all for it.

Good to know, thanks. So lets say I can afford practically nothing. Is it ever not worth it? i.e. Would $10 a week be too little to even bother?

Thanks, I think you guys (and the discussion today surrounding Branson) have given me enough confidence to start with a very small investment like you started with. Here's to us!

Well, we're not seeing eye to eye there.
My priority is happiness, mine and those around me. I work with disabled individuals and am trying to provide a better life for them in the community. Its not a lucrative position, but it yields me an immense amount of satisfaction. I have no interest in sacrificing any of that to make a huge profit, but I am interested in putting away just a little bit (less than $10) to invest in something I believe will make a good return.
I'm not here because I want to make a ridiculous amount of money. I'm here because I'm starting to think it would be stupid *not* to invest in bitcoin.

Got it. Question, though.
If I start at $10 a week and eventually have $500 in there, and then the bitcoin market crashes like it did a few months ago, I still have the same number of bitcoins, right? It may be worth $0.25 USD, but I still have the same number of bitcoins? In that case, its just a matter of waiting for the market to gain traction, again?
Another reason I am interested in bitcoin is because it seems like it would be easier to follow than some stock or other investment. Maybe I'm way off base there, though.

Thanks, man. You've been a great help. I'll be starting later this week, and I'm super excited.
To the future! To the moon!
