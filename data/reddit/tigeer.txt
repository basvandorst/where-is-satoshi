Because having a centralised organisation snoop on your private transactions is bad,
 unless that organisation is the government of course.

Borrowing money to buy volatile assets *especially* from friends is not good advice

For every bitcoin that's bought there's a bitcoin that's sold. Also this data doesn't show anything about the age of the buyers either.
There are plenty of good titles for this graph but this is just cringe and inaccurate for someone who claims on their Reddit profile to be a 'crypto journalist'.

Even better: Give them 23 words and say you accidently smudged the last one.

These "BitCoiN WiLL mAke YOu rIcH, bUy BItCoiN!!" posts are getting tiring.
 It's a bad look for this sub imo

I know, but it'll still require them to either research this and find such a tool, or to go to the trouble of programming a tool themselves.

I disagree; The bars move too fast to see many of the changes.
Bar races are typically better for cumulative data or things that change slowly over time. Interest in Bitcoin doesn't fit either of these descriptions.
Maybe a line graph or world heatmap would be better

I don't think this what OP is asking about, I think the question was more to do with the nature of buy and sell orders in a market and about liquidity.

People are willing to buy at that level **by definition** that is what bitcoin being 'at $400,000' means

Something tells me there were better ways to visualize this than a bar chart race

These types of lists and other 'recommendations' by Google are usually referred to as "featured snippets" and are determined and selected with close to no human input. Google doesn't like to disclose the exact source code of how certain information from websites is chosen to become a featured snippet or even when a featured snippet is appropriate.
 But it certainly is not deliberate or malicious as the results have almost certainly been determined by a machine learning algorithm that has found a lot of webpages mentioning 'Craig Wright' alongside 'CEO of bitcoin'. 
For example if an article's title was "Craig Wright claims to be CEO of bitcoin". This might be picked up on.

It saddens me that bitcoin supporters can actually be this ignorant as to how a search engine works.

**This is OP's car and OP's bitcoin address, they did not see it randomly on the highway**
Check OPs [post history]( for proof. Edit: I called this out on r/CC when they were pretending the address wasn't theirs and OP has now deleted that post.
They've received 0.0035 BTC since October, one person has sent them BTC since this post was made.

Did you really take this photo?
It's a pretty common meme and i can find examples of it being shared on Instagram over 4 months ago.
