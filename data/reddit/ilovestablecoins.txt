No, currently Samourai wallets send the entire xpub (a list of all addresses that will ever belong to you) to the backend servers. The servers respond with a list of transactions and unspent outputs, but these transactions and outputs come with no proofs/headers or anything like that. For this reason, when you use Samourai, you trust the company not to keep logs or reveal information to anybody.

Hi, great question.
You will get 0.1 BTC clean, 0.2 BTC clean and  0.25 change. The chanve will then be mixed twice to create two more 0.1 BTC outputs. The 0.2 btC can be mixed again to create 2 mixed outputs.

Hi there, thanks for taking the time to consider your privacy.
* **How does the Wasabi Wallet CJ compare with the Whirlpool CJ?**
If we are talking about the two implementations in a purely technical sense, they are different in a few ways:
Wasabi wallet is only available for your desktop. The wallet combines network level privacy (hiding your IP address and not revealing your addresses to the network) as well as on-chain privacy in the form of CoinJoins. Samourai, like Wasabi, implements Tor for routing transactions and querying information about the wallet. However, the Samourai wallet on your mobile does not do any validation of coins received, and does reveal your xpubs to the Samourai back-end server.  With Wasabi, your client receives BIP157/158 type block filters and then queries for entire Bitcoin Blocks from nodes over Tor (if you do not have a full node running on your own device). Thus in terms of network level privacy, Wasabi has some advantages over Samourai, in that it is a trust-less solution. However, Samourai has a friendlier UI and is available for mobile, which many folks prefer. Remember that to mix your coins, your must have a desktop instance of whirlpool running, but the coins are spendable in your mobile device.
When discussing on-chain anonymity, we need to talk about how Wasabi and Samourai implement Coinjoins. For starters, both systems use equal-output coin-joins of specific denominations, but the two wallets have different denominations which appeal to different groups.
Wasabi Denominations: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 BTC ...Samourai Denominations: 0.010 &amp; 0.050
Thus Samourai has an advantage for user who deal in smaller amounts or transact in payments of roughly $100&lt;&gt;$500, whereas Wasabi is ideal for larger denominations.
Now in terms of anonymity approach, Wasabi and Samourai both have a model of 'participants' queuing their coins and rounds of CoinJoins happening. Samourai has a simpler model, where each Coin-Join is always 5 participants, whereas Wasabi allows for up to 100 participants but averages about 75 at the time of writing. For this reason, Wasabi is clearly quite a bit stronger in anonymity terms, as the anonset is between 10x -&gt; 20x larger. Both systems encourage re-mixing, however, Samourai prioritizes users with un-mixed coins (who can typically mix very quickly) over users with mixed coins (who have to wait for 12+ hours for a single re-mix), whereas Wasabi treats new and re-mixed coins the same and allows for mixing roughly every 90 minutes for either.
Overall, if you want my biased opinion, I would say that Wasabi is quite  a bit stronger in privacy, in particular because of the trust-less model.
Wasabi has a simple model where users are charged 0.3% for mixing coins if there are 100 participants in the mix. If there are 50 participants, Wasabi will charge users proportionally less (0.15%). You can expect to pay roughly 0.2%-0.3% per CJ most of the time, and when network fees are very high, this can go up by 0.1%.
Samourai has a sifferent model, where a user is able to send as many coins as they want to their whirpool for queuing in either the 0.05 or 0.01 BTC pools. If a user shows up with 1 Bitcoin, they still only pay the flat entrance fee of 0.0025 for the 0.05 pool and 0.0005 for the 0.01 BTC pool. If you only queue the minimum amount into the pool, you essentially pay 5% + network fees for the entire CJ (0.2% or so ), however if you have much more than the minimum, you can still only pay the flat fee + network fees (which scale linearly with the number of coins you have). Note that Samourai does not charge users to re-mix (no network fees or CJ fees), but the process is very slow.
Again, this is my biased opinion, but I hope this helps you think about the two wallets.
Also, please consider join-market, which does not have a friendly GUI but does have lower fees and a customization for the equal outputs. Paging u/belcher_ and u/waxwing to defend JoinMarket!

I am an independent researcher and work full time in this space, mostly studying stable coins, privacy, new financial instruments and censorship resistant money. I found out about Wasabi 4 months ago and have been doing extensive research on the project, which I consider to be wonderfully interesting and an amazing example of good privacy implemented for the average joe.
So I am a fan.  
Recently, though, I have been asked to help the devs (who work around the clock to keep the software extremely well maintained) with respect to answering some questions that folks have about using the software and privacy. Answering these questions has been very helpful for me to better understand privacy and is necessary for my research. I also love it and am happy to help a person looking to do better with privacy.
I have not received any money yet, but I may be compensated (not anything much) for my work. Thus far I have answered all questions as a fan.

Nothing is ever "for for general use". I use lightning, if you posted an invoice I could pay it. But right now the difficulty and ease threshold may be above 90% of the folks that use bitcoin. One day it will encompasses 50% and then more.
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:52:56
@_date: 2019-03-16 23:06:30
Well that's quite an additional barrier and for now is not trust-less at all. The user has to be comfortable buying Bitcoin, trading for monero, sending monero, and trading back. Ideally the user would be able to simply buy Bitcoin, send to a single wallet and then have coins ready to spend that have an obfuscated history.   
[Wasabiwallet.io]( does exactly that - and it is trust-less. You cannot have your coins get stolen.
@_date: 2019-03-16 05:07:36
This is true in the narrow sense, but in a broader sense it obfuscates the spending habits of the user from the centralized exchange, and obfuscates the spenders history from the vendor. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 05:00:13
Wasabi wallet is a breakthrough for this space and is 100% trustless,  which means you dont have to worry about sending to a centralized mixer and losing your funds.
Furthermore, the cost is much lower, at less than 0.3% to mix all of your coins.
Wasabiwallet.io , please go on the subreddit and ask questions if you have any, the community is friendly.
@_date: 2019-03-20 19:22:03
Ok, amazing answer! Thank you. Follow up question - does a third party observer recognize that the payment of onchain funds is linked to a particular lightning payment?
In other words, if I make a payment with LN coins through this method, and somebody pays onchain for it, would you say that my transaction forwarding is anonymous to external parties?
What information is revealed to external parties?
@_date: 2019-03-20 19:09:04
What I don't understand mr.beef (huge fan btw) is how this differs from using zigzag the way I do now? I already send LN coins to ZZ and then get unchain coins to rebalance my channels. But the thing is, that method is not trustless! How exactly do you make the onchain to offchain transactions trustless?
Thanks for your response
@_date: 2019-03-16 23:09:09
I highly recommend that you save yourself stress and money and just use Wasabi. Monero uses ring signatures to make each transaction look as though it came from one of 8-16 previous transactions. Wasabi currently has CoinJoin transactions that have 66 participants, and thus an anonymity set of 66 (which is far better than Monero, at least in this respect).  
Wasabi wallet is trustless, which is the biggest advantage to using it over centralized mixers, and roughly 5-10x cheaper at 0.2% mixing fee.

Thank you for this comment. I can personally say that I the electrum personal server needs better documentation for Linux.
@_date: 2019-03-24 15:41:33
If the time lock is applied to the coins you are spending, and those coins are restricted from spending for 24 hours, then my intuition is that you would have to rebroadcast. Otherwise, a person could spam the mempool with transactions that wont be confirmed for years.
If you have a transaction where the outputs have a timelock against them (lightning channel force close) then you can broadcast immediately 
@_date: 2019-03-16 23:04:02
So Wasabi has had something like 20,000 Bitcoins run through the CJ txns. Those Bitcoins have then been sent to all major exchanges and businesses, and then mixed with other users coins.   
So - maybe all coins are tainted? Also - is the cash in your pocket clean?
@_date: 2019-03-15 15:05:24
Remember- only send mixed coins to samurai, not coins that remain as change. The wasabi wallet software will tell you whi h coins are shielded and which are just change.
Also, I deal if you send to multiple different samurai addresses.
@_date: 2019-03-16 23:13:50
(1) The reason that cash is fungible, is that if you have a $20 bill, the history of that bill is irrelevant, even though nearly all bills have seen illicit or under-the-table activity. My point here is that when you say that my Bitcoin is "tainted", my response is - let's try to spread the taint around so that all of the coins are linked to everything else, thus making Bitcoin fungible.  
(2) I really don't know where then coins have been sent to. I know each wasabi transaction, which is public and transparent, and I know the total number of coins that have been mixed, both of these facts are on the website! [Wasabiwallet.io]( \- right there on the front page!  
My guess is that people have mixed the coins, and somebody - I don't know who - may have sent to coinbase, or bought something on [coincards.ca]( or used bittrex or whatever else. These are quite modest assumptions - coins move around!

Ok, so a transaction may be rejected if the fee you set is below the minimum set by most modes, which is 1 sat/vbyte.
@_date: 2019-03-16 23:47:46
You know what, you are likely correct about this. If an exchange has blacklisted a particular address, and that address participates in wasabi\_txn\_57 (for example), then it could be the case that all of those individuals may be blacklisted from using that exchange.   
However, I went online and found the particular 2 addresses linked to the iranians (public information) and it looks like that money has been long since been sent to a bunch of different places including what looks like mixers and exchanges and mixed in with thousands and  now millions of other coins. It's kind of like the concept of 6 degrees of separation (you are connected to any person in the world with just 6 hops through acquaintances) - we all have touched coins that are in some way connected to those addresses. The same way that we have held cash that has been part of a drug deal.    
I think you make good points.
@_date: 2019-03-16 23:35:25
I think you make a good point about cash being far more fungible than Bitcoin, because it has no history to trace (except for maybe DNA or the numbers on the cash, but that is rarely used and quite expensive).  
As for your second point that exchanges will start blacklist or shutting down accounts, I am not sure how this would play out. For one, it is not illegal to do a CJ in most countries, and many people that use Wasabi simply don't want their finances known by the average Joe, so they are not necessarily doing anything illicit - just asking for what they would get with their regular bank account - privacy from the public eyes.   
So say the exchange says "all wasabi outputs are criminal and we will ban those accounts" - what Bitcoin that is two hops (two transactions) from a wasabi CJ - is that tainted? Now the exchange must ban nearly any merchant that touches $50 worth of Bitcoin and adds it to their $5000 float (tainting 100x the original amount).  
So I guess  I am asking this - with Wasabi doing as well as it is - is it really possible to ban so many tens of thousands (or likely, as you propose, hundreds of thousands) of coins?  
I think Wasabi is something we should stand up for as a right to basic privacy, and an exchange that blacklists those coins will lose a lot of clients, and even merchants.
@_date: 2019-03-24 15:31:28
Hey there, good question!
Do you have a transaction ID? If so, can you query  that txid on any bloxkexplorer to see if it is in the mempool or confirmed?

Bingo. Wasabi is an excellent wallet to move coins  that you received to a spending wallet or cold storage.

Even better, use wasabi wallet by going to wasabiwallet.io - fully trustless coinjoin mixer that let's you mix in real time without couns leaving your wallet. Try it out! Also cheaper than mixers or swap.
@_date: 2019-06-07 11:00:59
Sort of. The more appropriate way to look at this is "it is not clear where the funds from the bad guy went, and it is not feasible to ban all bitcoin that has ever touched a wasabi coinjoin, therefore the use of invading people's privacy with respect to their bitcoin is not feasible."
@_date: 2019-06-06 21:02:12
Hi there, thanks for asking such good questions!
* **Do I have to trust Wasabi if I use the wallet?**
No. This is a really important thing to understand. Wasabi is an open-source wallet that has implemented trust-less Chaumian CoinJoins ( [ ).  
But allow me to give you a TL;DR!
1. Wasabi never holds your coins and the wallet is entirely non-custodial (BIP 84)
2. Wasabi coordinator provides block filters (like neutrino) and blocks are received from peers over TOR, so Wasabi coordinator does not know which addresses belong to you, or how much money you have.
3. The process of the CoinJoin does not rely on the client trusting the coordinator in any way! The coordinator can't even link the mixed outputs from participants!
Great questions! BTW, please come hang out on our subreddit if you have more questions! r/wasabiwallet!

If a government can 'blacklist' a particular address, and perfectly follow the trail of user behavior, then is this system a system of peer-to-peer electronic cash? I don't think so. One of the best properties of cash is that it doesn't store the history in it. Without that property cash (and Bitcoin) are not fungible (exchangeable for another coin).
You really don't want Bitcoin without fungibility.
@_date: 2019-06-06 21:08:49
Yes! Great question!
1. Every Bitcoin transaction is spending money from a previous Bitcoin transaction, so it looks like this:  
My Exchange --&gt; My Wallet ; My Wallet --&gt; Merchant  
As you can see, the money I spend is directly traceable to the money from the exchange. 
2. In order to 'de-link' the money you received from the exchange, we will do a special transaction with many other participants called a 'CoinJoin', and it looks like this:  
Alice Wallet  ($13) --&gt;         ?? ($10)  
Bob Wallet   ($11) --&gt;         ?? ($10)  
Carol Wallet ($16) --&gt;         ?? ($10)  
Alice Change  ($3)  
Bob Change   ($1)  
Carol Change ($6)
3. Notice that there are 3 participants and three 'anonymous' outputs, where a person who tries to 'trace' the origin of the coin, it is hard to tell if it belongs to Alice, Bob or Carol. This is what a CoinJoin is, and the fact that Wasabi just did a CoinJoin with 100 participants means that the coins created by that transaction are equally likely to belong to one of 100 participants.
Great question!

The support of the broader Bitcoin community around the Wasabi wallet project is what really did it. A lot of people are to thank for the reward. I also want to point out that the Wasabi team is not just Adam Ficsor, but David Molnar (who is both a dev and regular author) and Lucas Ontivero (who is an awesome dev). Also, Max Hillebrand and Dan Wamsley, and the legal team. Then there are all the wonderful silent or anonymous contributors, who do their part to test and make contributions on github.
Further, the wonderful mods on this subreddit who promote sound money, fungibility and who voluntarily advertise the Wasabi wallet on the sidebar are also owed many thanks.
Great work and applause to the whole team!

Hi there, you should consider using Wasabi wallet to separate coins from your personal stash to coins you want to send friends
@_date: 2019-06-03 01:52:16
Yes! People don't realize that the limitations of scaling are multifaceted. One bottle neck was that every time a node broadcasts a transaction, it consumes bandwidth. In a perfect world, each node would receive that transaction once and only once, never hearing about it again. But since the current implementation relies on flooding (each nodes sends to all peers except the one that told it) the reality is that a transaction is being heard many many times by the same peer.
Through some clever tactics of set reconciliation, the authors have shown how their means of transaction relating (Erlay), they can reduce this bandwidth by 84% (if I recall correctly). This means that we can scale smart, not fast.

CoinJoin obfuscates the graph of senders and receivers. The result is that instead of a simple to read graph, where a person directly sends their coins to a merchant, each user is obfuscating the history of their own coins with 99 others, giving more privacy for all.
CoinJoin with 100 participants (usually this is 750,000 USD worth of Bitcoin in a single transaction) cannot be easily 'tainted' as those 100 participants will quickly disperse the taint to the entire ecosystem.
@_date: 2019-06-06 15:53:44

Bitcoin is not being given away.
Bitcoin is not very good at privacy, so tools like wasabi wallet exist to make privacy possible. Wasabi relies on people coming together to mix or "coinjoin" their bitcoins. If 10 people do this together, the outside world cant tell who is who (of the 10), but recently 93 people came together in a single instance of this joining.

Hi there, excellent question.
I can assure you that if you did KYC on your coinbase account, tracking your spending habits is trivial for coinbase.
If you would like a trust-less and easy to use way to avoid this sort of monitoring, please consider the open source wasabi wallet which is available on github or the official site wasabiwallet.io 
Wasabi wallet works on any computer, allows you to send coins and then engage in trustless coinjoin transactions with 70+ other privacy focused bitcoiners. The process is called "zero link" and is also open source and available on github.
Total cost for excellent privacy is 0.25% via the wasabi wallet, which is 10× cheaper than mixers and tumblers that you must trust to not steal your coins.
Please feel free to ask questions or join the subreddit where I am a friendly mod that will gladly answer all of your questions.

Hey u/intelligent_band thank you for taking the time to consider your privacy.
As a mod of the wasabiwallet subreddit, and as someone who has the privilege to observe the devs try to make wasabi work, I can tell you that a completely free coinjoin service that is as performant and reliable as wasabi is unlikely.
The challenge with building a wallet like wasabi is not just the code complexity, and managing a reliable server that coordinates the coinjoins, but also the promotion required to get enough users to join wasabi so that we have 50+ or even 80+ participants in a single coinjoin.
Let's say someone forked wasabi - all of the code is open source - they would need to get a community around the project to have the appropriate traction to get these coinjoin anonymity sets. (EDIT) Although the Wasabi ad on the Bitcoin subreddit is not paid advertising, people like myself are compensated for our work and that makes Wasabi easier for the average Joe. That is what the fees pay for that a free software would not permit.
When you go on our subreddit, any question you ask gets answered in 6 hours or less (by the devs ans myself directly) and that type of customer support can't sustainably work for free.
However- I do get your point. I think that in the future an even smaller fee would be possible but only with enough volume and traction.
Remember as well that mixers charge 1% - 5%, so wasabi is still a major undercut to the market.
Thank you for supporting the project.

Quite a bit more anonymous than Samourai - for one, Samourai knows your entire Bitcoin wallet, the Wasabi coordinator does not know a single thing about your wallet, because Wasabi implemented block filters similar to BIP 158 and Neutrino.

Hey - I get that! Merry Christmas anyways. Go and give some other redditors some tips. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:44:35
I paid it as well... interesting! Do you have more than 1 set of tokens?
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:16:10
No worries! I guess the folks that made the game got a few extra satoshis. :-)

Hi there, the fee does not go up when you run a large amount of Bitcoin. For example, if you mix 1 Bitcoin, it still ends up being 0.15%-0.2% in the past few days/weeks. Furthermore, if you mix a coin that is already been mixed once, you don't pay the coordinator fee, and instead you pay a few roughly 10-100x smaller.
If what you mean is that you constantly have new coins that come in to your possession, and that you need to mix quite a bit, I understand that it can seem like a nuisance that you are constantly paying a little bit, but think of it in a different way.  
You can spend Bitcoin with only miner fees OR  
You can spend Bitcoin Anonymously, by paying miner fee + 0.15%-0.25%  
I think a lot of people would not mind such a small fee for a huge feature.

This is a tough time for a lot of people in the space. What sucks is that scaling methods already available today allow for a 1.7 Mb block size pretty comfortably, but because of lack of adoption from a small number of big actors, our actual block size limit (average) is 1.3 MB.

I believe that blockchain has very narrow utility, namely for censorship resistant financial instruments. Bitcoin is the best and most secure and liquid financial instrument, but censorship free stable coins also provide a lot of utility for the space, and soon they will be backed by bitcoin. It may be an unpopular opinion, but stable coins are quite cool

That doesn't look like a lightning payment request. If I send you Bitcoin this way, it will take 10-60 minutes to confirm, and as much as a few hundred satoshis in fees. But if I send you a lightning payment like this : !lntip 100 then I can send less than an on chain fee!

Try to reload the page. It keeps a cookie of how much you are owed. Not dangerous
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:48:22
Hey u/brendzy \- are you sure that you are online and well connected? I tried to send the payment to you multiple ways and couldn't reach you. If someone else pays this invoice they will get my tip!  
Edit: Found the problem, you are connected to someone who has uncapped fees on their channel. I toggled the switch off and it worked. Curious to know your lightning setup. Success - Paid!

 [  (I am a mod on the subreddit, please come by and ask us questions) is the official site.
Short and sweet - coins never leave your wallet, and your keys = you bitcoin. Wasabi wallet does fully trust-less chaumian CoinJoins. Simply download the wallet, send coins and queue your coins for CoinJoin with 50+ other participants all over the world. Everything runs via TOR by default, and you will pay no more than 0.3% form a CoinJoin, which is way more competitive than the Mixer space.
All downloads can be verified with signatures and nopara73 (Adam Ficsor) is the main developer behind the company. Brilliant guy, definitely a privacy nut.

Go to the site I showed you. Click "buy tokens" and an invoice will appear. Once you get enough satoshis to pay the invoice you can simply withdraw it from the tip bot
