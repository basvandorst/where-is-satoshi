Why exactly am I a piece of shit? Because I don’t care enough to go look at treasury notes? Projecting much?
I was referring to the stock market, which is what most working class people think about when they hear “investment”. 
And treasury notes aren’t risk free. Nothing is, you piece of shit.

Again the people who live paycheck to paycheck like myself can’t really afford to invest... we get hit hardest.

You can only do that if you have enough $ to invest in the first place - and prior to crypto in the US you have to be an accredited investor. Just another block for the average person. 
Most people don’t have $10k minimum laying around... so the working class who lives paycheck to paycheck and one unforeseen major expense (car breakdown, health problem) away from disaster can’t just avoid inflation the way wealthier people can.

“It is cheaper than an average holiday for two, a really shitty second hand car and is roughly the same price as what Americans spend on engagement rings.”
God this is painfully out of touch. I haven’t gone on vacation in years, but when I did I spent about $1000. A shitty used car is $1-2000. A $7,000 used car is usually pretty reliable just older. 
I can’t say anything about the cost of an engagement ring... but people generally don’t get married for investment purposes (not to mention bitcoin was supposed to be digital peer to peer cash). 
Also using bitcoin as a way to hide your money from your future ex-wife/husband is shitty. Just get a prenup. 
I’m not a writer nor do I have a finance background but I’m sure I can write better than this. I have absolutely no idea what any of these things have to do with fidelity coming into the crypto markets.

I fully agree with you. I’m in crypto because of its creation as a response to the corruption of the banks.... and now that crypto has become (slightly) more mainstream, especially after the bull run in December, the majority of people involved in crypto today are driven by greed and profits and couldn’t care less that its whole creation was in response to the never ending greed and corruption of the banks.
I’m more of a fan of the bitcoin cash form of the currency, as it is IMO the way the currency was designed to be used. What seems to me (a non techie) to be artificial limits placed to the currency by its “core” creators already reeks of manipulation for greed. Bitcoin itself seems like it’s already been co-opted by the banks and other large powerful organizations, and perhaps the US government itself (purely speculation, but let’s be real - US power is derived from USD being the backing currency of most of the world - any threat to the USD is a threat to the US).
I should also mention that I’m a fan of ethereum, monero, dash, and iota... before people think I’m some sort of bcash troll. No crypto currency is perfect, we’re still in the early stages of this long game, and everyone should keep an open mind and not forget why bitcoin was created in the first place.
TL;DR: the banks are not our friend.

Really? I call it bcash because it takes less time to type, and I don’t mind them at all.

“Stop talking smack about your ex”
LOVE IT! Seriously some of these crypto peeps treat their coins like an ex lover or something, shits crazy. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:39:26
Considering bitcoin was created in response to the banks, and now the banks are doing their damn best to take over bitcoin. I can see a very valid argument for other cryptos, including bcash. 
It is in my own interest - and yours whether you know it or not - to take power away from the banks, not give them more power to manipulate markets and people.
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:50:28
Sure, but no person is going to read it as such.

“It’s only drawback is centralisation which affects the everyday citizen very little.”
FALSE FALSE FALSE!!!
I don’t even know where to begin with this one. I guess I’ll start with the first block, a NYT article in 2009 about bailing out the banks. The centralization of the banks encourages corruption and manipulation, both in the financial markets and in politics. War is profitable to the bankers, which is why historically bankers have financed both sides of a war. Just like in politics, they lobby all parties, because it doesn’t matter who’s in power, they win. Heads they win. Tails they win. The whole thing is rigged. They win no matter what. This affects everyone even if they are too poor to even have a bank account (often those people are on the receiving end of some financed drone missiles)! 
Fast forward to 2008, all of their bad decisions finally come back to bite them. the whole market crashes, people are kicked out of their (bank) foreclosed houses, meanwhile those same banks are being bailed out by we the taxpayers (same people being kicked out of their homes), their executives get bonuses of more than we would make in a lifetime, and unemployment rises to something like 20% or so (the numbers were always fudged). Even more amongst people my age, who had the terrible luck of coming into adulthood just as the market crashed. Our lifetime earning potential diminished. 
I don’t really care what your politics are, and mine don’t really matter, but most people in the world (especially outside of the US) would consider president trump to be a dangerous and unpredictable problem, both with his cozying up to authoritarians, his idiotic trade wars, and his mental instability - and he’s got his finger on the nuclear button. His existence as the president is a DIRECT result of the bank bailouts of 2008. The American people are pissed, and that’s how they are shoving their middle finger to the bankers who got off with the financial crime of the century (thanks Obama!). Not a single banker was thrown in jail in America. Not one. These actions (or lack thereof) have effects, and the biggest one is an extremely polarized country on (in my very unpopular opinion) the brink of another civil war. Of course trump is “new boss, same as the old boss” and will be just as corrupted by power and wealth as the previous 44 (only more mentally unstable). 
Don’t for a fucking second think that bank centralization isn’t a big deal, or doesn’t matter to the little guy. The little guy is the one who is most harmed by this corrupt system. 
And that doesn’t even take into account all the fucking fees and charges that come with banking bullshit. Don’t have x amount in your account? Charge! Direct deposit and automatic billing get fucked up by a bank holiday? Overdraft fee! All for what, 1-2% interest per year if that for the banks to “hold your money” while in reality they are actually lending it out? Ever hear of fractional reserves? 
Sometimes I wonder what the motivator of bitcoiners are - I see with you, satoshis original vision means little. Never forget the bank bailouts, the largest transfer of wealth from every day people to the already extremely wealthy probably ever.

The pawn shop will exchange your gold to fiat, and the realtor will help you sell your land to someone else in exchange for fiat. The fiat gets spent at the grocery store. 
If the economy were to collapse tomorrow, any store owner would likely take your gold in exchange for whatever. Land is harder to sell, as it’s a larger $ item and harder to divide into smaller amounts. Imagine if bitcoin didn’t have satoshis, and you had to do all your purchases in whole bitcoins? That would be like trying to do business with land.

Why does this post scream troll post? Why not have both? Diversification is a good thing. The day the masses adopt crypto, they’re not gonna give much of a shit about bitcoin vs bitcoin cash, if either are even around in that time period - or are surpassed by a more popular crypto that might not even exist yet. 
I might as well post what I ate for breakfast, that’s how relevant this post is.
