Quick question for you guys. I've been investing in bitcoin for a little bit and I use coinbase just for ease of use and since i'm doing a small amount. My dad just decided to invest a couple grand so i'm trying to ensure his money is safe. Am I good to do this through Coinbase or should I move to Gdax (I know it's the same as coinbase), or move to a different exchange and get a wallet. Haven't done research on wallets so not too knowledgeable about that. Any help is appreciated

Might be because litecoin CEO was on CNBC this morning doing an interview?

Nope and i've opened up numerous tickets and haven't gotten any help from them

I'm at 24 days and 3,600+ confirmations and still pending on a coinbase transaction

I guess I can do this as a last resort but it would suck as its doubled in value since then so i'll get half the amount of BTC now

Corect just BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC. Use binance for the other stuff

I've had a BTC payment pending in my coinbase for almost 20 days with 3,178 confirmations. Obviously support is of no help. Is there anything I can do to recover the BTC? Could the sender reverse or no since it technically went through?

Coinbase to gdax should be instant since they're essentially same owner. Pretty sure gdax pays transaction fees so it's free to transfer to binance. Binance has some fees associated with trading and withdrawals though

I usually buy from CB and transfer over although I understand if you don't want to do business with CB anymore then best bet would be binance. I've also sent LTC to binance a bunch, swapped that for eth, then used that to pickup some alt coins

Try again in a few minutes. Happened to me earlier then it went through like 10 min later

I use coin stats on my phone

no fees

Not sure I didn't watch it i'm just guessing maybe it gave it some light in the media and people are seeing it as another viable option

Binance. Open an account and transfer in eth or btc and you use that to buy ripple

I know binance has a USDT but there is no way to deposit in USD from bank accts or anything like that. Essentially I use it by using eth to buy alt coins, then when i'm ready to move back and cash out i'm going to move the alts back to eth, send to gdax, and withdraw from there to USD
