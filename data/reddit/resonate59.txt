You won't see the recent transaction until your client downloads and processes the blockchain up to the point that the transaction happened.  Your money is in the address, you just have to finish syncing.

it is up to you too report it.  a million dollars in purchases with no income reported will eventually get caught

If you were to do this the US can bar you from ever returning to the country (even for visits).  So that would be a huge commitment.

Until BTC value stabilizes prices probably need to be pegged to fiat currency.  
"With the value fluctuating constantly (and being deflationary) I just don't see how bitcoin is going to work for anything other than one-time payments."  Every bitcoin payment currently are one time payments.

They think that the price will go down short term and they want to buy back up at a lower rate.

I have no idea.  That is just how I consider it.

Thank you :)

Every single thing of value only has value because people think it does. Thats how the system works.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:30:01
Its easier to just make an account and import your public keys.  It keeps track of everything for you.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:10:43
No, not yet

Like it or not, there are people speculating on bitcoin.  Speculators provide liquidity to markets.  But with speculators comes profit taking.. and guess what, after a run like this lots of people want to lock in profits. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:10:56
More people buying than people selling.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:10:37
Even with the threat of double spends, the fee diffrence from taking bitcoin vs credit card far outweighs a remote double spend chance
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:14:15
That isn't necessarily a trade, someone could have just been moving coins between wallets.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:35:12
How can the dump part fail?  If they sold all their bitcoins then it succeeded.  The goal of a pump and dump is to make money... not to crash the price. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:47:33
People that don't know better do.. Also the same kind of people that panic sell.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:23:41
Obviously importing only your public keys in blockchain.info

It truly is a bold prediction.

Gotta love the over reaction to any correction.  It's not even the biggest one this week!
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:34:39
All thefts have one thing in common, they stored their bitcoin's in an online wallet.  Store them offline and you are safer
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:04:27
Well not ALL of that $50,000 is profit.  In the scenario you spent $1 per bitcoin and sold them for $75. You sold 666.66 bitcoins with net profit of $74 leaving $49332.84 minus $200 for a total of $49132.84 taxable.

In the long term the market will decide what fee will be accepted.  Competition will likely drive it down.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:26:50
@_date: 2013-03-30 05:59:03
More likely to sell at the bottom and buy on the way back up
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:11:31
$200 trades going through now

Well done!

This happens often.  After a day or 2 of moving there is several days of flat lining before the next move

Because Bitstamp's chart hasn't moved in like 8 hours

The whole video is really interesting but I linked right to the part of micro payments.  I believe this would be the best bet for gambling.
@_date: 2013-10-25 20:06:16
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:12:56
Yes, it can.  But it requires a banking system using bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:38:37
There is a really really really ridiculously large number of addresses

The trading engine lag was stupid high.  Like 1 hour+.  You can see the lag at  it shows up right below the last trading price

"If you have a gain on a personal foreign currency transaction because of changes in exchange rates, you do not have to include that gain in your income unless it is more than $200. If the gain is more than $200, report it as a capital gain. " source IRS website

Bitcoin is an experiment in digital currency.. No one said it would be perfect.  This is showing what the problems with the system are and only serve to teach us how to build a better currency.

Did you watch the whole video before you posted?
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:59:24
I don't see them either
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:40:34
no, not in the lifetime of our sun
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:06:59
That wouldn't work because you would be asking the retailer to take the risk of bitcoins falling in price while you reap the benefits either direction the price moves.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:31:17
Do you take paypal?
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:11:21
Yes, you spend your bitcoins.  As soon as the desire for goods now is greater then your desire for future (potential) profits, you will spend.

Zooming out on the market depth chart doesn't give accurate data out that far.  Yes granted that is what the current orders are, however, as price moves more orders will be put in place.

Lost coins are lost forever.  There is no way or need to recover them (unless you lost them, but thats your own fault).  Bitcoins are infinitely divisible, the only way for dealing with lost coins is deflation of all others
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:26:22
Everything remains exactly the same, other then the lack of bitcoin stipend for each block.

Not breaking any rules... rules which on their exchange are made up by them and can be changed to reduce abuse.

I found out about it from Wired magazine's article "The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin"

haha awesome

Capitalism at its best!  They are providing a service (easy transfer of bitcoins for cash) and making a premium.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:37:42
 Spending bitcoins that have appreciated is a taxable event just the same as cashing them out
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:27:42
Yes, because the chart is deceiving.  You see $7 mil but the real number to get there is much higher because people haven't bothered to place orders yet.
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:12:04
Closer to max? We don't need to be worrying about that.

That article is what got me interested in Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:47:16
I believe the way that site works is that when you log in you decrypt your wallet locally on your computer.  So unless your computer is compromised a person hacking the site can't take your coins.

That makes no difference.  Even when you barter with no money involved it is still taxable.

But market cap of bitcoin doesn't show that it is passing them.  First off, all of those companies pay dividends which drops their market cap, into the pockets of investors.  Second, the stock value of those companies is partly determined by profits not by volume of transactions.  Bitcoin's market cap is determined by much different forces.
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:53:30
On a green candle, the bottom of the box is where prices started at the beginning of the time period and the top is where the prices were where it ended.  For red candles it is the opposite. The long line that goes up and down the middle is the entire range that it traded at.  So if you're looking at a chart with hourly candles and the asset started at $5 and rose up to $15 before dropping to $3 and finally closing at $10, you would have a green candle with box from $5 to $10 and a line through it from $3 to $15.  I know its not exactly for a 5yo but this is the best I can do.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:44:09
I didn't either! What a coincidence!

If it becomes less profitable then less people will mine. As less people mine the difficulty goes down and make it more profitable.
