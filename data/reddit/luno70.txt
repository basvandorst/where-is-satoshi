I completely agree with these objections, and now all these years after it will be absurd. If it had been done right after, only Gox traders would have been affected.

It will undo whomever has already got compensated, but remember every transaction is kept in the blockchain, so any fraction of  a Bitcoin ever paid to the deposit wallets at Mt.Gox when they operated can be traced to their current location where they will be withdrawn and deposited back to the wallet that deposited them to Mt.Gox originally. There exists forensic software the calculate the transactions necessary to undo Mt.Gox completely. Implementing this into a wallet update is easy!

Yep, the claim page is bogus, it doesn't work. I can no longer log in with either my credentials or email.

That is not needed. An update to the wallet software can be issued that voids all transactions to Mt.Gox ever, so that every wallet that ever paid any amount to them, will be automatically reimbursed. This version of the wallet software needs 50% majority on the network to be accepted by the blockchain, but in principle, everybody ever having lost money to Mark would be magically able to grab them back. Much easier than the current process!

Please be serious, this thread is about pleading Satoshi Nakamoto for reembursing creditors, my suggestion is somewhat more realistic. My balance is 198 BTC.

What are you talking about? If they purchased stolen Bitcoins, should they be allowed to keep them? Also a wallet update need majority on the network, so more than half of every BTC holder should accept such a solution for it to work voluntarily, that would be hard I presume.
