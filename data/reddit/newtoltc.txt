Or just buy Litecoin.

Or use Litecoin. It's Bitcoin but better (for most applications).

You don't have to back BTC. That's the beauty of this new system.

Except Litecoin can handle 4x as many transactions as BTC (i.e. has time to figure out how to scale), handles spam better and has clear technical leadership.

Litecoin unaffected

I've been a huge supporter of BTC for years but this political deadlock is getting out of control. If you're building a product you can't serve 2 completely different use cases. BTC wants to be a currency and the WWL and it can't do either of those things well. I've moved on to like Litecoin because of the developer leadership and the networks focus on being a currency/commodity. The devs will be releasing a proposal soon on how they'll manage scaling the network by introducing a fee marketplace. I wish the BTC devs would just make a decision and code but I'm afraid politics have slowed down development so much that it could impact the longterm viability of the network.

It's sad when people don't diversify. LTC is the only viable alternative and has clear developer leadership. Not only that, but it can handle 4x as many transactions, handles spam well and it hasn't even halved yet. (!!!)

No one will disagree with you there. The point I'm trying to make is that some of those developers may leave the bitcoin project because of the uncertainty (or for philosophical reasons) which will most likely cause users to follow as more applications are written for LTC. 
One of LTC's benefits is the fact that it's incredibly similar to BTC and so a lot of the BTC projects *should* work with LTC.

Q: Why would I want to use it?

Litecoin. I've followed BTC for years and it's refreshing to see leadership.
