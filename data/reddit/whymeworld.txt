Bitcoin is still tough to use in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, I love btc, but even a system as messy as paypal works smoother than bitcoin does. It's faster to transfer (a few seconds compared to upto half an hour or so for verifications to happen), and what you get is what you get, ie, $100 dollars sent to you, that's what you get. With bitcoin, they could send you $400 in 1btc and all of a sudden you've lost 20 dollars.

- Volatility needs to decrease (the general population won't use it if they think one day it can get them a playstation, the next day it can get them a cup of coffee)
- Acceptability; needs to be accepted in many more places
- Accessibility; they need to be easy to get first, which till today there are still many barriers and headaches to getting bitcoin, and it comes at different prices with different challenges
I see this taking another 3 years till it starts to stabilize and really go mainstream

Awesome, the more money that gets pumped into this, the more stable it will get as a payment platform (eventually)

I've had a different issue but this is definitely the last time i'm dealing with them. They locked me out of my account after I paid $200 to purchase a wishlist for someone in return for btc. When the transaction was done, they locked me out citing 'suspicious behavior' and would ignore my emails - they reply once every few days saying nothing we can do without verification, even after i've sent them all the documents required to verify everything. The btc in escrow has been released to my account already but I can't access it any more.

I have no issues with bad customer service as long as there 'is' some sort of customer service eventually, but they're flat out ignoring me and giving me reasons that don't make any sense. 'Cancelled' transactions? Both have been shipped and one already delivered, and they can obviously see that via the tracking numbers on Amazon. I actually had a lot of hope for the site and was planning to be a big buyer, but they're not giving me a reason to continue with it.

I don't mind paying fees on ebay but 10% gets ridiculous when you're selling higher priced items. They should cap it for certain amounts in my opinion. 10% of a $50 item is fine, but me trying to sell a $1000 laptop and them taking a $100 bite is a bit extreme.

1- I'm only using one account, no transactions cancelled and i've sent you proof, both items/purchases were shipped, one has already been delivered. Now, I can post screenshots of everything to prove this here but I didn't yet, and the only reason i'm posting to reddit is because no one on your side is even replying to my emails to give me an explanation
@_date: 2014-10-03 21:41:30
Well, US and a couple of other countries. Didn't accept mine. 
I'll go back and check, hopefully they start accepting more countries.

Well to be honest i'm hoping companies could provide customer-service to their clientele without us having to resort to things like reddit and social media etc. It's frustrating. $200 is hardly the end of the world for me but for others users it could mean a lot.

tried them about a month ago with no luck, will check them out again now, thanks!

Bitcoin has it's fluctuations just like everything else. Gold, dollars, british pounds, apple stocks, the economy.. The general trend seems to be upwards in my opinion as more and more places start to accept it but it's still pretty volatile. Until the price decides to stabilize a little (not for another few years I think) we won't see it go superbly mainstream, but it will, eventually

The more the merrier!

So if you make a 0.01 coffee purchase, it'll round up to the nearest bitcoin, and transfer 0.99 btc to your savings wallet? :)

Haha, thanks. Idiots never learn
