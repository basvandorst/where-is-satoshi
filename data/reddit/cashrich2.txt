If crypto is really the only option then if I were in your shoes I’d 
1. Cash out what you need to survive for 3 months
2. Learn to trade crypto professionally to chip 5-10% profit a week on your portfolio. Invest in a really good course. Learn genuine strategies to minimise risk (most important until you have money to burn) and practice for a couple of weeks on a dummy account at the least. Forget missing moves during that time. You will win later and lose little. 
3. Start out Trading on a decent and stable exchange even if it doesn’t have every coin you want. Risk management is everything. 
4. Do not get emotional about trades. That’s what gets you caught on pump and dumps. 
5. Once you’ve doubled your crypto trading account take some profit. Look to take some monthly if full time while letting your portfolio grow. The more you have the more you can make and diversify your risks. 
6. Understand trading in bull AND bear markets. What goes up always comes down. Where there is volatility you can make money. 
Learn everything you can. Technical analysis is really important as is understanding how this market works from peak times of day to signals of pump and dumps. Learn about the practical aspects of the coins you invest in and the people involved and stage they are at. The alternate coins can go huge and then disappear overnight. Do not let greed overpower rational thought. 
Be patient! Do not overtrade. 
Lots can be made and lost. The losers always fail to successfully manage risk. 
Lastly... be grateful. You’ve been gifted something to change your stars. Treat the opportunity as a gift and be grateful for what your dad did. Very few people get that opportunity. If you understand and appreciate this then you will respect trades you make and do his gift justice.

Bull trap
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:12:35
Forgot to add. Try to use that 3 months before cashing anything out of your trading account. Live lean. You’ll thank yourself for it. 
Oh and forget lambos. And moons. They’re for children and likely to get trashed by professional traders. No depreciating assets. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:46:37
No it doesn’t. It bans anonymous trading. This is about transparency and consistency. This is needed if you want mass adoption and institutional money. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:16:07
Be careful of eBay. Heard of scammer packing up on they opened and getting the security words. A guy got his wallet cleaned out after a couple of weeks! Buy from trusted source only!
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:04:19
It’s pretty cheap right now from it’s ATH. Nobody actually knows. It’s best guess really. You can always sell part of your holding and use that to buy if it’s cheaper. Worst case it goes the other way and you later se a few percent. DYOR and decide how much risk you’d want to take.

I live just outside London and my house is in a bubble. They are literally everywhere. Everything runs in cycles if it has utility. Most crypto has utility. The ones with the best utility, market presence and user value will win. Just like businesses. 
Tulips had little utility. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:20:00
Ah. Good old Daily Mail... never lets the truth get in the way of a good story. Wouldn’t wipe my arse with their rag. Nothing to see here. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:24:36
Unbelievable!! Lmao
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:42:03
All markets go through a bubble. The point being when you get in vs when you get out. Google Amazon Facebook, Uber, etc all did rather well don’t you think? 
Just back the right horse, closely manage your risk and get your timing right. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:35:44
Uhm... everyone else hold so you can cash out? See the irony at all? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:35:34
I agree With above. I can see those who know about crypto certainly using it as a store of money. I am. We are due the next stock market cockup and I’d expect many more people that get wind of that with Cash to put it in places like strong stable crypto and gold (traditional) ahead of it. 
The thing that s BTC is pretty wild in volatility so that could still turn quite a few away. I expect it to settle down soon though if it wants institutional money directly in it. That said ETH and Ripple tend to be more stable at the moment so you could see surges of investment there and with LTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:39:44
Oh, I’m not. Just don’t whine about noobs so you can get yours. You can hodl or trade in and out at the right times and build your holdings. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:48:31
The risk of that not happening in major ways is the high volatility and lack of regulation.
@_date: 2018-05-11 05:58:34
You realise that without buyers AND sellers there is no market, right?
What was your original buy-in price btw? It makes quite a difference to how people invest and trade.
@_date: 2018-05-13 08:04:42
Just take a look at the DJI chart and zoom out. It will tell you all you need to know. People talk about Crypto bubbles... the stock market bubble is massive. The technicals show up to a 45% ‘correction’ due which should be starting end of this summer and lasting the best part of 2 years.
Will this mean money from selling at the top flows into crypto? That’s the theory, but the reality is the market is crazy volatile so I’m not sure. Most money will seek stability in a crisis. Crypto is still unregulated and very far away from stable. That said crypto is a tiny market still so expect it to rise. 
Also not good that weapons manufacturer stocks are some of the fastest growing, right now.

Err... congratulations? What’s your point man? You got in early? You’re rich? So what? If your life savings were 50,000 then you’re very rich. Bravo. If your life savings were 400 then you can have a really nice holiday. But really buddy, I don’t think anyone cares...

You’ll find out in 6 months...

A sentence in need of punctuation?
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:25:39
Ah... the wisdom of crowds. 
Ok. I’ll say it could hit 3200 by the 15th August
@_date: 2018-06-11 05:39:00
Buy volume was shocking. No buyers, more sellers equals downwards price. Look at what just happened. I still think it might get to those 8400 levels but probability says not based on the buyers right now. No buyers are stepping in and we are not far away from the year low. That’s not a good sign. Any rally could be short lived. We are in a downtrend and We’ve broken major support levels in a day. That’s not good for the short or mid term tbh. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:47:10
�� yeah. It’s not a bad time in the grand scheme of things depending on your trade or investment plan. Long term laddering in buys is good. Especially if this keeps dropping. The volume is a big concern though. Simply no new money coming in. Good luck buddy and hope it all works out. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 17:24:27
My maths is ok and how I manage money and risk is pretty good. Combine the two and there is way more upside than downside. Since Feb my use of volume, Fib, trend and price has seen me up 400% catching swings between pivots in my trading account. My hodl account is way less, So I’ll stick with the bullshit I think ��. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 10:20:32
That’s true enough to a point but retail trading is thinning out hugely at present and volumes dropping generally. I fully expect price to come down on BTC another 25% or so before we find ‘the bottom’. It will take the alt market in its entirety down considerably more IMO looking at technicals and market structure. An awful lot of factors at play such as institutional market control, regulation to come, exchange/ tether manipulation, whale dominance. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:12:57
You’ll find the direction most likely is down. We hit 7777 already and that is a continuation pattern. 3k BTC possible by mid august. Volumes are rubbish right now and few buyers outside technical pumps. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:11:45
Lower prices will come though suspect it will rally a bit before another steep drop. The bottom is not in. Buy more when it drops hard again would be a non traders strategy worth considering. I reckon we’ll find the bottom late aug through mid sept 
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:48:23
If it goes to 9500 then it’ll drop back down. It’ll be lucky to get to 8500 at this rate. Don’t fall for it. It didn’t break 10k last month and volume had been dropping steadily for 6 months why would it break higher from there when it could have done so in May but didn’t? 
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:07:02
And the technicals are very clear if you actually know what you’re doing. ;)
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:19:30
Sadly not. It’ll go to 8500 to 9k at best over next few weeks then it’s going to dive. Expect sub 5000 before its resurgence. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:06:06
It’s called market structure. Look up wyckoff accumulation and distribution cycles. Macro view the charts, and overlay the two. We are in the middle of the correction still. Volumes are down, it’s little more than pump and dumps. New futures are about to open and short the shit out of it to wash out as many retail hodlers as possible. 
Oh and6, 23 43 19, 25 and 49
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:38:44
It’s at a point of breakout down if dropping meaningfully into 10500 range or it pushes up today and breaks the major down trend resistance at the 12k mark. 
Can’t help feeling it’s a bull trap though. Big volume last night selling. The next volume spike up or down will decide. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:13:35
It’s not erratic. It’s very well structured in fact. An accumulation pattern by whale level money. You want BYC as a currency then it eventually needs to settle at a level of stability. Leaving that to emotional retail buyers is suicide for stability and this suicide for mainstream. It is heavily manipulated but those with means will want certainty before mass adoption. That means they will want control. 
I don’t like it, to have control in the hands of a few, but unfortunately that’s the world we are in because people are too easily manipulated and vast numbers are crazy we are damned if we do and damned then if we don’t. 
My advice learn to trade and how they make moves. That way then  you can manage risk. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:52:05
Those doodles on a screen doubled my holdings over the last 10 days. Happy with that. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:20:21
It’s being solved right now. The correction is about getting a start point to build from now the genies out the bottle. Regulation will straighten out the volatility eventually. This is a new thing and until those in power figure it out it’s likely to continue. 
Trading the swings is a gift if you know  how to.

You are joking right? Have you ever watched Laura Keunssberg’s attempt at impartiality??
These guys are as biased as it gets. They’re just very very good at it. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:53:32
Agreed. The daily RSI also not quite oversold yet either suggesting another drop to come before a full on trend change. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:45:19
Expecting a hatchet job, timed with a sell off to scare retail investors out. Watch out for a lot of fud the next few days. 
The BBC is establishment through and through and they will not want us to benefit from this product until they are in control of the market. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:27:51
I’d check the daily.... not even close to oversold yet. At least look at the 4hr
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:50:23
Bad day?
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:32:37
Isn’t price movement how any trader or investor makes money? That’s an idiotic thing to say. Volatility can make people lose as much as others win. Signals showed when the market was relatively over bought, so sold, then bought when market was oversold. Hedge funds employ armies of technical analysts to best time their trades. But sounds like you know best. Have at it pal. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:00:05
Don’t be bitter. Just making the calls when the setups are there. Not sure why you are so upset about it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:09:13
One main reason. Natural correction to the 200 day moving average. Healthy. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:58:01
No. 
It’s a mix of whale movement and vast amounts of coordinated fud. The exchange robbery was only one thing in a long list of January bad news. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:34:33
Uhm. Just dropped 15% since yesterday. But hey I’ll claim my extra 10% holdings from buying on the dip yet again and wish you all the best. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:40:32
Read up on Wyckoff Method... then decide in the grand lifecycle of institutional money looking to get involved. 
Compare the Wyckoff phases chart with bitcoins recent bear run. 
Then you’ll have a very likely scenario. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 14:59:19
I know what you’re saying but we only know the real bottom in hindsight. Looking at the technicals of the market the probability suggests in the circa 4000 range due to the massive volumes traded at those levels historically. The markets will take as long as they take though. 
There are two problems.
1. Almost no new retail investor level in bitcoin. Markets move on supply and demand and the demand is not there. 
2. The manipulators of a market move it in their favour. Sometimes that’s up and sometimes it’s down. We don’t know until it happens. With such little trading volume in BTC it’s very very easy to manipulate. 
Both situations require volume to deal with them. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 05:58:50
Those that are taking the summer off already knew this was coming, came out and switched to a short position already. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:35:12
Just watched it. Ill informed, designed to scare joe public and didn’t really say anything at all about the actual technical benefits of a crypto based financial system. Very one eyed. It simply lampooned anyone who had done well and did a lot to reinforce crypto being a scam. 
You think that was accurate journalism?
@_date: 2018-07-03 06:55:57
By the end of the year? It’s a How longs a piece of string question. The bottom needs to be found first. We’re in a bear market so the probabilities are down from here. 50k to 250k this is is fantasy when looking at How markets work. That’s institutional money levels and that’s not happening without regulation. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:37:53
Just be watchful of tether. They’ve still not opened up an audit and are well and truly on SEC radar. If tether is suddenly outed for a scam then it is likely to be dropped faster than a hot potato. BTC will get that black swan that will certainly take it to sub 4000 if that happens. There’s a high risk of USDT being worthless if this happened. Personally if your exchange supports it, I’d get it to USD or other fiat. Looking at timings I forecast September as being a major low and good buying opportunity but time is always the hardest thing of all to forecast. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 17:19:51
I’d suggest right now it’s safer, but there may be a run on all stable coins for safety if tether goes bang. Just be cautious. As much as people don’t like it, fiat is the safest bet and using major exchanges (except Bitfinex) which I believe will get crushed if tether was outed as a scam.
