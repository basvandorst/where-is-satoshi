ive been saying this since this story broke, and i've only been met with resistence here.
you say it, and somehow manage to garner upvotes.
good on you sir. good on you.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:28:36
it is all circumstantial evidence, some of it stronger than others.
the profile fits (his lifestyle, background, etc).
the weight is in what he said to the reporter when they met. 
"I am not involved in that anymore", "I left it to capable hands".
I'm paraphrasing here, but thats the gist. You can say the reporter outright fabricated these statements if you'd like, but if that were the case, you'd be better off fabricating something much more damning.
I am not saying 100% this is him, but the story carries weight, and it only carries weight because of how he has reacted.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:33:07
technically, yes.
will that happen? no.
On top of needing the Bitcoin core developers to OK this, you'd need broad community support as they all would need to run software to support the infusion of 750k btc.

There's plenty of circumstantial evidence, there is an obvious lack of direct evidence.
What kind of evidence do you call a conversation between 2 people?
Circumstantial evidence requires inference, which is all Leah has come up with, which is why she is being crushed in the media.
She has a strong circumstantial case, no one here wants to admit it though, and I'm not sure why.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:05:40
to be fair, this is the first time a news story about his identity has carried any weight. everything before this has been almost complete conjecture.
you can say what you want about leah's journalistic ethics, but there is some pretty strong circumstantial evidence that would lead you to believe dorian is satoshi.

The article is hogwash now as Dorian has publicly denied his initial statements. All we have now is a man, who publicly seems like a dufus, but clearly made a lasting impression on a journalist enough so that she was willing to risk her reputation on the story. Sadly she didn't do enough research and now we have a man, who could be Satoshi, exposed publicly, but there is no way to prove or disprove this anymore. 
Take that however you want it.
Satoshi saying that he is not Dorian, does not implicate, nor exonerate Dorian from being Satoshi. It simply adds nothing.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:17:44
there are many ways to script something like this to create an alibi, it is just not enough...
to exonerate dorian at this point, you would need satoshi to publicly reveal himself.

This is silly, so this is the last time I'm going to respond to anything you write.
The original comment is 2 comments above what you quoted, and directly infers Satoshis post discredits Leah, which it doesn't. Someone made a post about the burden of proof being on her, which was completely irrelevant to the point, and then you chimed in about proper debate rules.
I understand that you understand proper debate format, but that has no bearing on the original comments here.

this doesnt exonerate dorian nakamoto. the man is adamantly denying being satoshi already, this only helps his argument (meaning it would serve his interests to post this). the only way to prove dorian is not satoshi is if satoshi proves he is satoshi.

This does nothing to discredit the article. all it does is potentially prove that satoshi is not dead.
Dorian (if Satoshi) would have access to these accounts and could post anything he wants on them.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:13:44
No, this does nothing to descredit the report, god dammit, think about it, use basic logic for fucks sake, jesus fucking christ.
It does not exonerate Dorian, if Dorian is in fact Satoshi, he also has access to all of these accounts.
The ONLY thing this does is prove that Satoshi is alive and paying attention to the situation... or his account has been compromised.

When u submit a transaction to the block chain you are transmitting that to every node listening. The malicious node(s) also receive the transaction. They take it, recompute the inputs and outputs and pass it along. And since most wallet software does not use txid as th identifier they accept that changed transaction as valid (because it is)

again, we are talking about THE POST ON P2PFoundation, NOT the newsweek article.
satoshis post does NOTHING to discredit the article, as Dorian (if actually satoshi) would have access to these accounts.
I am not questioning the lack of journalist integrity that Leah Goodman clearly exercised. Her article is half baked at best, with some seemingly strong circumstantial evidence, albeit nothing damning enough to draw any serious conclusions, but again... this is not what this post is about.

Put yourself in her shoes.
You have a conversation with Satoshi. It goes down exactly like she describes it. There is no question that he understood the conversation. You publish this information and EVERYONE is telling you that you are a liar.

You have to understand that they service many people, you wont hear about the 99.9% of successful transactions that happen at Coinbase. 
You only hear about the .01%, the vocal minority. Every company in this industry is going through growing pains right now, including Coinbase. They are a good company, and do their best to give quality customer service.
Check over at if you don't believe me. Many of the devs and csr's are constantly in there remedying issues that have fallen through the cracks.
That being said, healthy competition is always good for the industry and the consumer, so here's to hoping we get a few in 2014!

since most people wont give you a sincere answer...
The intention of Litecoin and scrypt mining in general was to disallow the use of Asics and GPUs, so that everyone could mine. However, the scrypt algo does not prevent GPU's from being effective, and there are hints of asics on the horizon. So even though right now Litecoin is still pretty decentralized that may not be the case in the future.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:49:39
you are right, and if satoshi just posted "i am not 4_teh_lulz", that wouldn't rule me out as being satoshi.

@_date: 2014-03-07 05:12:16
yea i guess i said that in a roundabout way.
satoshi can only prove hes satoshi, by coming out publicly and then signing a message with some of his early public keys.
dorian cannot prove he is not satoshi, though he could offer up enough insight to consider beyond a reasonable doubt, he is not. this would require a huge invasion of privacy though, and would ultimately never truly prove he isnt who people say he is.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:02:17
OPs comments inferred that Satoshis post in some way made Leah's article worse than it already was. 
Which it does not in any way, unless you can prove unequivocably Dorian is not Satoshi, which you can't
Logically, either Dorian is Satoshi, or he isn't. If he isn't then the post does what you say, Satoshi looking out for someone falsely framed as him. If he is, then Dorian is posting this as a means to discredit Leah, as he has been trying to do all day.
We will never know what the truth is here, as it is unlikely Satoshi will ever reveal himself publicly.
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:20:30

@_date: 2014-02-12 00:15:58
it is yes, and in bitstamps case it is essentially flooding the block chain with erroneous transactions, as each transaction is represented at least twice. one with the original txid and another the the mutated txid. its essentially creating tons of double spend attemps, which will fail 100% of the time.

@_date: 2014-03-07 02:01:25
you are right, though one could theoretically corroborate times and alibis when satoshi was known to be active. i suppose that might be stretching after so much time has passed though.
either way, this post doesn't change anything. only that the real satoshi (whether that be dorian or not) is aware of the situation.

this isnt about burden of proof, or beyond a reasonable doubt. it is simply that this bit of information (satoshi claiming he is not dorian), doesn't change anything. and most certainly doesnt discredit leah any further. as her credibility lies with her claims being true, which this post from satoshi does nothing to prove one way or the other.
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:06:28
You've missed the point entirely.
This is not about the news article, this is about Satoshis post on P2PFoundation.
If Satoshi posted, "I am not 4_teh_lulz", that would not do anything to prove I am or am not Satoshi. Additionally, it would do nothing to discredit the initial claims that I was. (if such claims were to exist)
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:47:24
Ugh. This is not the most damning evidence. His response to the reporter when they met in regards to Bitcoin is.
"I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it," he says, dismissing all further queries with a swat of his left hand. "It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection."
Everyone on here is very quick to dismiss this story. I will be the first one to tell you, this should not have been published without more corroborating evidence, but that doesn't mean what is there has no merit.

She didn't mess it up alone, yes she was the lead journalist, but there was a team of analysts on this story. As well as the editor-in-chief who made the final call to print the article.

I agree with you that the article is shoddy journalism at best, however I am talking specifically about the tweet here and Satoshis post non p2pfoundation. 
This simply does nothing to prove or disprove that Dorian is Satoshi.
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:22:54

@_date: 2014-03-08 04:31:10
I think what she was trying to say here is that she used the process of elimination to find viable candidates to investigate further.
At which point she found Dorian, among others. After meeting with him and hearing his confession she became convinced. 
The problem of course is that the confession is not recorded and there is no way to confirm the veracity of the remarks.
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:25:38
There is very strong circumstantial evidence that he is in fact Satoshi. You would not know that from this subreddit though, as everyone here seems to have a severe hatred for Leah, and assume she is evil for no reason other than her half-baked article.
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:10:03
Her proof is the conversation she had when they met. In her eyes it is strong because she experienced it. We, on the other hand hear a conversation retold second hand. It carries much less weight to us as we cannot verify it.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:38:14
again, i am talking specifically about satoshis post on p2pfoundation, it does nothing to discredit the article.

that's pretty much how I feel about it. She put a story out that was really only half researched.
Regardless of how strongly she feels Dorian is Satoshi, you need real evidence before you out someone like that. Not just a he said she said argument. I'm willing to bet there was pressure from above to get this story published and/or the editor didnt reign her in when she should have.

@_date: 2014-02-11 00:23:52
Ermm I think the exploit this guy is talking about has more to do with the exchange not wrapping account balance updates in atomic transactions. It's an entirely different kind of exploit.
That being said I wouldn't put it past gox to have this type of vulnerability based on their record, but this doesn't single them out as the culprit in any way.
@_date: 2014-03-07 12:36:40
There are no material facts TBH, its is all circumstantial evidence. The most damning evidence being a supposed conversation between Leah and Dorian when they met face-to-face for the first time. 
However, I am going to reiterate again, for the 4th time. The conversation here is in response to Satoshis post on p2pfoundation. His post does nothing to help or hurt Dorian, because there is no way to verify Dorian is not Satoshi. 
This is the last time I am going to respond, because it seems like we are just talking past each other.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:51:00
agreed, this lends more creedence to dorian being satoshi, frantically trying to come up with a cover.
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:39:56
this is going to be a very basic example and im going to skip over a lot of the nuances and caveats but the basic issue is:
when you put a value through a hashing algorithm it produces an output value unique to the input value. so an example would be something like.
input value = "address1 =&gt; 1.0, address2 =&gt; 1.2 timestamp 02-11-2014 12:00AM"
output value = iuashdq897h11d1egygydgausyd128e7
now you can see that the input has 2 payments, one to address1, and another to address2. 
now imagine this case:
input value = "address2 =&gt; 1.0, address1 =&gt; 1.2 02-11-2014 12:00AM"
output value = 9823kjdsi8wqkdkhw38fhkanrku32i
notice how the order of the address payments has changed. even though this is still the same payment, the order in which the inputs was changed, changing the output value.
again, this is a VERY basic example and is not exactly what is happening with bitcoin. but it exemplifies the underlying issue.
the same information rearranged produces different output results. now if you are relying on the output value to track the transaction, someone can intercept this value, re order the input values, and pass it along, still valid, but no longer trackable if you are using the original output.
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:21:54
You would fire the editor first. This is the person who is ultimately responsible for the content of this story. Leah can't just publish a story like this. It needs to be vetted, and a story like this would even probably need to be vetted by the legal dept.
There were many people involved in the greenlight for this story.
@_date: 2014-02-19 02:50:50
Assuming broader adoption in the future, we would see a drastic increase in transactions/second. An increase in the number of transactions processed is also going to increase the number of fees collected for each block.
Currently I believe the technology is limited to ~7 transactions/second. As the dev's improve this and as Bitcoin's adoption grows you will see more transactions and as a result more transaction fees included in each block. Resulting in an increase in transactional profit vs mining profit. What this ratio ends up being will ultimately vary based on adoption and block reward.
The difficulty will adjust accordingly.
Food for thought: 
A large credit card processor, processes 2000 transactions per second. Currently Bitcoin can, at a maximum, process 7 transactions per second. Read: [Scalability](

If he were in fact Satoshi he would own something like 10% of all available Bitcoins. He could literally crash the price of Bitcoin down to nothing if he flooded the markets trying to cash out.
Satoshi has remained silent for years and it is generally accepted that he has moved on and is not interested spending the coins that are theoretically in his posession. Him "coming out of retirement" would signify a shift in his thinking and may mean he's ready to start dumping his coins.
The reality is no one knows what would happen and uncertainty = market drops due to fear.
