Sarcasm or not? I assume it is, but I can never tell.

This is less disrespect than usual. I would call it optimistic and a tone change. Read a WSJ article and they just shred btc.

That has nothing to do with crypto. You have the flu.

Blockchain remains very real even if bitcoin pops and fades away. I love that many fortune 500 companies are investing in blockchain technology. They are not investing in bitcoin.

But Warren has also called btc a, “mirage” with no intrinsic value. He seems to believe it is a speculation fueled bubble akin to the tech bubble of the late 90s.

Blockchain has a ton of use cases. It is really exciting.
Here is an article on using block chain technology for an electroinic medical record.
“Blockchain technology can be disassociated with the bitcoin currency and used in a variety of other settings (both public and private) where one desires a validated, unalterable, time-stamped, and decentralized ledger. We leverage these blockchain properties in MedRec to streamline access management for EMRs.“

Im an outsider as well - The best I can figure- butcoin will be money. It is like the internet taking over money. Eventually, all the money in the world will be bitcoin.
I don’t think that is likely, but I think internet money sounds awesome. It will decrease the power of government and eliminate banks. Value will be added by replacing banks?
Ive been trying to wrap my head around it for months. I cant see it not being a massive bubble. But if our kids really just all use bitcoin in all countries... that would be pretty awesome.
So, im for it? I think.

Those two statements are consistent. He is correct, no definition change is necessary.
