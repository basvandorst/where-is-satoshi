It could also be a "payment-for-order-flow" type situation.  Market makers of stocks in the US routinely paid/pay brokerages to send orders their way knowing that big money will be made off the execution of trades.  Madoff's firm started the practice.  It could be that Chinese bitcoin exchanges agree to charge no fees but are privy to actionable market internal dynamices and trade execution services that are guaranteed to make the firms money.  Essentially, they would be trading against customers.  US discount stock brokers do this all the time.  Scottrade, for instance, has historically made more than the $7 per trade it collects by selling order flow to algo market makers.  One discount broker was recently paid several hundred million dollars for routing one year of stock trades to a particular HFT operation.
This is pure speculation, of course.

It is official.  A large contingency of people over 60 see television as authoritative.  To watch television programming, especially an obscure channel like CNBC, is tantamount to special knowledge that is way above the fray.  
Today, a retired government worker with an ex real estate developer husband told me that the stock market is rigged.  She got out yesterday because of what she watched on television.  Apparently, she has never been guided wrong by her television viewing when it comes to investments.  She also was concerned about bitcoin because of what someone on television said.  Finally, she said that the Book of Revellations says that Russia and China will start the final war and it is near.  I don't know if this came from television either.  When I questioned her logic and interpretations she spewed a bunch of nonsense.
I feel like so much of the population is Chance from Being There.  Of course, the movie was a satire not real life.

Talked to one guy about bitcoin today.   He had heard of it listening to NPR.  He seemed to think bitcoin was done, the price had collapsed and it was hard if not impossible to spend.  I refuted his points.  He was most concerned with "bitcoin not being backed by anything" (government guarantee).  The conversation then turned into how I was up considerably in bitcoin and litecoin and trading strategy.  Overall, he was one of the more open-minded people I have talked cryptocurrency to.  I doubt he will use bitcoin anytime soon without an explicit government guarantee.

Bitcoin is a fleck.  gold is not losing steam from BTC that is certain.  BUT if BTC were to ultimately get 10% of the investment dollars of gold that would imply a BTC price of roughly $28,571 all other things being equal.

I think the "internet ID" thing has long been established it's just that there wasn't an official "ID."  With the Snowden revelations we see that the US government will track and store all data it can get its hands on including internet traffic, visits and other data.  Then it is stored forever in the monster data center in Utah that is coming online.  So I am thinking that the "internet ID" thing is for legitimate purposes as our individual information is already collected and parsed.

I can't go through all the posts here but would like to point out that *112 million in excess ill-gotten liquidity in a one billion (September 2013 market cap ?) or 6 billion dollar market cap is not so much* relative to other investments.  also, *one cannot determine or estimate the "true market price" of bitcoin based on a fraction of the market cap being fraudulent*.  I say this because in traditional investments like stocks, bonds and commodities there is easy access to leverage...  not so in bitcoin.  Hedge funds and banks use leverage to buy stocks, bonds, pork bellies, whatever.  We can't determine what the price of Facebook would be without investors using leverage just as we can't determine what the bitcoin price would be without Willy.  When US exchanges emerge and Wall Street enters then bitcoin will be subject to just as much leverage as everything else.  To assume the price will stagnate because of the one-time elimination of a fraudulent source of liquidity in an unlevered investment is wrong.

it's hard to prove ownership when there is no auditing (Fort Knox) and everything is opaque (how much gold has China purchased over the last five years?)....  also there is a precedent and tacit mandate for the Federal Reserve to suppress gold prices...  not so with bitcoin.  at this point, US central bankers have better things to worry about than bitcoin price suppression.  I have always wondered if bitcoin wasn't created to mute the effects of an extreme gold shortage that will send the price of physical gold instantly much higher when futures exchanges start defaulting and sovereign claims on gold stored in the Western world are unmet (Germany, etc.).
to claim that a government can control the price of something indefinitely is presumptuous.

Ten years from now, the IRS is still around.  I have made payments for capital gains from here until then.  There is an oversight, however, and I send some BTC from, say, Coinbase to another wallet.  Then that wallet sends it to another wallet and sells BTC at a small profit.  I could envision BTC tracking software to be advanced within 10 years and possibly be able to track down ancient transactions.  Of course, if this is possible in the future then interest and penalties will be applied.  Possible?  What do you think?

seems like a lot of people here are confused by big numbers.  $112 million and 270 thousand are big numbers.  fact is, if bitcoin was a stock, "Willy" would not have to file as a controlling shareholder.  the reason is 270k bitcoins is less than 5% of the float.  
the only conclusions I can make from this information was a lot of unsavory stuff was going on behind the scenes.  we may never know the exact mechanisms or everyone that was involved.  ***but if bitcoin can be manipulated to increase 10 times in value in a month based on a program trading bot amassing less than 5% of the float then that is very bad news***.  what is more likely is that Willy was merely a component of the rally last fall and not the hammer that was purported.

NYDFS may have the resources to pursue grand crusades, but most states probably do not.  Even if a few other states pass onerous and sweeping bitcoin regulations, most will not or will not have the resources to enforce them.  Besides, bitcoin is global; when and if it is widely accepted globally, those harsh state rules will be eased and the crafters of the original bills will be seen as asses.  The only issue is if one state can kill bitcoin before it gains better acceptance.  I don't think NY can.

He should have just laid out his position that BTC could go to $10 or less.  That would have been reasonable.  He also should have stated that it was due for a severe correction.  Everything that goes up thousands of percentage points in a year corrects severely.  Instead, he claims that it will drop to below $10 by July unequivocally.  Then, a few weeks ago, he reiterates his $10 or less price tag but is ambiguous about the timeline.  Somehow he knows something about BTC that the market does not (?).  Seems like he is stubborn and out for publicity.

China mines the most gold in the world (I believe).  None of it escapes its borders.  Not only that, China is a major gold importer.  
I really don't see gold hoarders/ bugs in the US coming close to matching the supply of gold from the cash for gold phenomenon.  Instead, it all goes to China, India, the Middle East, Russia, etc.

In the regulations, there should be proof of ownership for each account holder.  And by proof of ownership, each holder's BTC should not be lent out (to sell short) unless agreed upon by customer.  Each exchange should own 100% of holdings and not be fractional reserve.  A decentralized exchange would be key as it would eliminate the risk of naked short selling, egregious price manipulation and other tomfoolery.

I live in a mid sized city in the south (US).  There are lots of old retired people and a small military base.
-My mom has a jewelry store in the local mall.  There has been an electronic billboard advertising that she accepts BTC and sells it since October of last year.  I have some of my Casascius and Lealana coins displayed as well as BTC stickers.  Not one purchase.  Perhaps a dozen people have asked about it.  Three quarters of the people asking about it have parroted negative opinions from news snippets (it will be outlawed, it is illegal, it is a ponzi, etc.)
-I truly believe that most people, young and old, have never heard of it or don't really know what it is.  This community is a couple of years behind the time.  Perhaps in a bustling suburb, the knowledge base is better.
-The *only* person in this community that I have encountered that has a good grasp is a local college kid.  He and his younger brother (middle school age) also knew of dogecoin.  They didn't, however, know about LTC or other alt coins.
-One of the largest penny stock promoters from the past has never heard of Bitcoin.

If the electric grid goes down there might be satellites in space that will beam the blockchains.  Certain miners and people will always have power.  Really, the grid for all nations would have to go down simultaneously which could be accomplished through nuclear devastation or plague.  In such a situation, personally, (assuming I would be alive) I wouldn't be worried too much about bitcoin.    Gold and silver would come in handy for basic survival bartering.  I'm not a tech expert, but it might be possible for a rogue nation to kill the global internet without affecting power.

"If you can take delivery (i.e. withdraw) and deposit easily, it's extremely likely that it's real."
Banks allow you to do this and they are fractional reserve.  As long as everybody doesn't want their money at once, they are fine.  
Exchanges should allow you to see your holdings at anytime on the blockchain.  I think that would help.  Perhaps this is already possible; I'm not a technologist.
A concern I have is a big exchange with Wall Street financing comes in and starts making big leveraged proprietary trades (fractional reserve) on their exchange, manipulating the emotions of Bitcoin holders and affecting the price on all exchanges.

instant consumer savings....  a consumer gets instant savings using bitcoin with minimal effort.  a consumer wants to purchase something and the vendor wishes the customer use bitcoin for various reasons.  the vendor passes on some of the savings (which is beyond 2% intercharge fees) to entice the consumer; the consumer converts money to bitcoin in a process that takes minimal time (less than a credit application).  both parties are happy.  the consumer gets more comfortable with bitcoin and starts using pre-funded cards to pay for gas for their car at the service station.
I feel that the consumer is less concerned about the loss of of some protections using bitcoin versus credit cards (returning merchandise, etc.) than others assume.  consumer protections still apply at brick and mortar locations.

I'm in both.  Gold and silver bullion are good insurance options for my situation.  Even if gold were to go back to sub $400, I would continue to buy some.  Physical gold and silver don't have counterparty risk.  Bitcoin, however, could be hacked, rendered undesirable by authoritarian governments, etc.
I didn't see the video but doubt that crypto is taking any steam from the gold markets. The numbers don't match up.  The market cap of bitcoin and all altcoins is a fleck of the gold market.  2982 tons of gold were produced last year.  There are 29,167 troy ounces in a short ton.  Bitcoin has a market cap of about 6 billion.  At $1251 per troy ounce, you can figure out what the global gold production was last year.  Keep in mind, that almost all gold isn't expended in industry and gold is recycled into investment bullion.
That said, I would be ecstatic if 2% of gold investment money went towards bitcoin.

I am thoroughly relieved that they didn't go mark-to-market accounting.  My guess is they initially just focus on exchange sales for cash where they can get the exchange to turn over records.

You are historically inaccurate, MrDiddyK.
In the late 90's into 2000, Mary Meeker and Henry Blodget were pounding the table on Amazon.  At one point, I believe, AMZN had a market cap greater than all brick and mortar retailers, combined.  It was grotesquely overvalued.  During this time online stock trading ads blared nonstop.  Everyone everywhere had an online account to trade tech stocks.  Formerly conservative investors were allocating a hefty portion of their portfolio towards tech.  Everyday people would stare in electronics stores to see the Nasdaq price on the televisions.
Objectively, this feels like the internet 1995 or 1996.  Most people had heard of the internet somehow but misunderstood it.  It was shrouded in controversy (porn, illegal stuff, etc.).  AOL would routinely drop 50% in a short time frame but come roaring back like the honey badger.  No one really knew where the internet was going except a few far-sighted evangelists.

Some people use pans in the Cascade Mountains to mine gold.  Others use big equipment.  Gold is bulky but can be melted down and anonymously sold for cash anywhere in the world.  When it is melted down, it is untraceable.  Using gold as a medium of exchange is clumsy.  Some people say gold is money.  I say gold is a complement to the money we are accustomed (government cash).  Gold has limited use (like bitcoin currently).  Its value is derived from scarcity and tradition.  People, governments and institutions hoard it in vaults and safes.  Few people with gold ever intend to fashion it into something useful like jewelry.  Similarly, few BTC holders probably intend to spend all of it for a commercial purpose.
Gold and bitcoin have little counterparty risk.  Gold probably has less counterparty risk.  The bearer of gold doesn't care whether a bank goes down or not.  There is a risk in bitcoin unlike gold of the network going down.
I would say that historically it has not mattered whether gold was mined with powerful equipment.  It was valuable when such mining equipment was not available.  Lots of gold is currently mined using primitive methods especially in places like South America and Africa.  There, they have lots of illegal strip mining.
Gold goes through cycles where it backs currency or is used in currency and is ultimately devalued.  This has happened as far back as Roman days.  Devaluation, rehypothecation and other forms of dilution haven't happened to bitcoin yet, but they may some day.  Who knows?

There needs to be some common sense applied.  Someone goes to a casino and, if they win a small amount, they don't have to fill out paperwork when they cash out. Someone can sell something like $15-$25k a year on Ebay without getting an annual tax form.

He appears to be recommending a commodity futures tax model, but BTC is not a derivative like futures or options.  Perhaps because BTC is under the purview of the CFTC?  Are corn or soybean cash markets taxed accordingly?

I see it as a logistic nightmare for the IRS.  I have no idea what percentage of Coinbase BTC purchases were ultimately allocated to outside wallets, alt exchanges or swished around to different venues before being converted to $USD or goods and services.  It has to be high, and IRS resources are limited.  Is the IRS intending to audit hundreds of thousands (?) of people to discover that most lost money in the BTC ecosystem?  Sounds like a bunch of BS.  Also, keep in mind the complexity of BTC and how much more difficult it is to track v., say, conventional forex trading.
@_date: 2016-11-26 15:07:44
I completely agree with this article.  I just don't see what the IRS can realistically do except punish those Coinbase users that clearly bought and sold on the platform and reaped large gains without reporting.  Move your coins to another wallet?  Exchange for LTC or ETH in 5-10 steps? I don't know.
There are so many unaddressed issues. Hacking is rife.  What if someone lost because they were hacked?  What about the folks like myself that lost BTC at BFX and were converted to tokens?  I can't even log into BFX now even though I didn't change the password info.  What about folks that made money at Crypsty or some other defunct exchange and can't even pull up their records?
It's BS.
@_date: 2016-11-21 18:09:58

@_date: 2016-12-02 15:37:14
My guess *and it is only a guess* is that if you move coins back to Coinbase and cash them out and don't report the sale, the IRS will try to treat the coins as having a cost basis of zero unless you can prove where they came from and what you paid.  But how can the IRS realistically do block chain analysis on a large scale or at all?  It's not like blockchain.info or BTC-E wallets report official government statements.
@_date: 2016-11-20 20:48:43
That would surely be challenged.  Do we even know that Coinbase determines a value of the BTC at the time of transfer?  I wonder if there is even a reliable time and sale record anywhere.  It would also be a new precedent;  stock transfers, for instance, between two individual accounts with the same account holder on record are NOT considered sales.
What about hacking?  What about BTC losses that were transferred to BFX tokens?  What about people that traded at defunct operations which may not have records or even known points of contact?
Also, what benefit would this be to the IRS?  They spend tremendous money and resources tracking transfers when the net effect would be negative.  After transaction costs, most quick transfers out of Coinbase would be losers.  I don't see how they can justify this angle on a cost benefit basis.
Keep in mind the IRS is fighting a lot of wars with limited resources.  Due to the complexity of BTC transactions v. regular financial transactions, the IRS manpower required and the low return on investment (almost certainly negative) of auditing 95% plus of Coinbase accounts, the IRS will have to focus on the big red flag accounts.  I just don't see how mom and pop can be affected.  MHO as a non-accountant/lawyer.

I first bought my first installment of coins after the spring 2013 crash.  It was late spring early summer.  Of course, that is not early adopter status relative to many bitcoiners.  I first heard about it from Zerohedge.  I can say absolutely that I was a very very early adopter of ZH if that is seen as meritorious.  Many people don't know this, but ZH started off as a small contributor on Seeking Alpha.  Many of the ZH contributors were also on SA in the early days.  I was maybe one of only 100 ZH SA followers back in like 2006.  ZH then moved onto a Wordpress blog and became famous/infamous.  Anyways, I was a rabid ZH follower and shorted the stock market in late 2008.  I actually shorted AIG via puts in August 2008.  Thanks ZH.  
I have an exceptional memory.  I clearly remember ZH mentioning BTC going over $1.  That would have been the first time I heard of BTC...  still kicking myself for not buying one of those early plug-in BTC miner gadgets.

Utility doesn't always prevail. Diamonds, for instance, are more valuable than synthetic diamonds (moissanite).  The naked eye of an average buyer can't tell the difference.  Chemically, they are the same.  Gold has no utility other than ornamentation and limited commercial uses.  Is the market wrong?  Has the market overpriced gold for thousands of years?  Of course not.  Bitcoin and gold both have their place.  Bitcoin can be hacked; gold can be stolen or confiscated.  But some farmer in India with sporadic electrical power should continue to gravitate towards gold as a store of value for the foreseeable future.  There are a lot of those Indian farmers out there.  There are also a lot of other cultures and regimes that value gold.

Everybody has a theory.  Here is mine:  Gox was operating on a fractional reserve basis after the hack that sent BTC from $30 to $1.  Customer funds were then used for operational expenses and high living.  Karpeles attempted to manipulate the bitcoin market to keep the company alive and, possibly at one time, earn back the lost coins.  Did you see any evidence of proprietary trading at Gox?  It seems inconceivable that tremendous profits could not have been earned from market manipulation (ie. remember that ridiculous arbitrage rate at one point between Gox and everywhere else?) and yet the company folded.  Did Karpeles have a gambling problem?  Did he actively trade other stuff (commodities, options, stocks)?  Any evidence of rogue trading?

either I've been very lucky or order cancellations on CB are rare since 2013 and overblown on reddit (user w/ many many transactions of different amounts w/out one cancellation).

how did he get the weight right?  as I understand it, the size and engraving can be perfect, but the weight will be off.

  It did matter that the Gox price was  dramatically less than BTC-e or anyone else because 1.)   it lured in a bunch of money at the end from people thinking Gox would survive and they were getting a deep discount on bitcoin  2.)  in theory Gox (Karpeles) could have arbitraged the difference and pocketed big money

MtGox_Adam is saying he wanted to buy a Lambo as his first car initially.  He also spent about $1M on the "bitcoin bar," and it was never opened.  How much in elite sushi and Starbucks did he consume a day?

What was the purpose of the "bitcoin bar?"  Was it a whim of Karpeles?  He sunk about $1 million into it, no?

Poloniex was hacked, a Chinese outfit (forget name) walked off with millions, the Texas ponzi scheme, etc.

Would you consider yourself to be a winner in bitcoin or a loser?

This whole argument has a lot of legal gray area.  Historically, commodities traders were not charged with insider trading, but it looks like there are some new rules and the CFTC has gone after at least two entities in the last two years for insider trading violations in commodities.
From an ethics standpoint, I don't think Charlie Lee did anything wrong assuming he didn't front run his tweet.  He should be commended for disseminating this information to all traders/investors assuming it is true.

I would argue that not investing and wasting time spam trolling is more of a loss than buying fairly early and going through some price corrections.  I would say "congrats" sarcastically, but I guess that you are 1.  a long or 2.  someone in a third world country with power and an internet connection that gets paid 1 penny for every post.  Salud!

The shiny metal fetishists' cynicism.  They are outspoken with misconceptions of bitcoin while harboring dark beliefs that only "gold is money," people will be carrying around satchels of yellow metal bricks for trade in the coming armageddon and that they are future heirs and pseudo barons of a coming dystopian world.

It was $2 or less before the 2nd run in 2013 where it topped out at $49, but it was under $2 AGAIN a couple of years later and was at about $4 until March of 2017

using US dollars?  you might be supporting North Korean counterfeiting operations.  you also might be supporting organized crime and hostile regimes.

I started reading ZH when they were a blogger on Seeking Alpha in about 2007.  They only had a few followers, and this may have been before they were blogging on Wordpress.  Their articles on banks and the financial system definitely influenced me to go short in 2008 early on.  Also, I first heard of BTC on ZH.  They had an article announcing it went over $1.  They had other early articles.  I clearly remember coverage in the spring run of 2013.
I still read ZH everyday.  They have a slant, for better or worse, that can't be found anywhere else.

...or that she claims to be "not a technical person" and ignorant enough to run a private server for Sec of State business, but opines on this issue.

It will be hard to completely enforce in many if not most countries even if bitcoin and other easy alternatives were to be banned and enforced with harsh penalties.  Criminals are highly resourceful.  The black market is huge.  A lot of people in the US, at least, get paid in cash.  A crackdown on cash/bitcoin/gold/etc. would lead to a bartering system or some genius alternative IMO.  It's not like the corner drug dealer will be accepting ACH payments and paying tax anytime soon!  It's like pushing a string to try to do this.

My 2 satoshi:
It won't happen in current form.  It isn't politically expedient.  
Why?  No one.  NO ONE is going after grandma when she hands out the gift cards at year end.  Doing the shit in this bill is utterly insane!  Even if the will was there, the cross-border cryptocurrency rules for one are utterly and ridiculously unenforceable.  I can just remember the brain wallet and think "eff you" as I or anyone else crosses the border.
