Now you just have to convince your clients accounts dept to follow suit and it's game on.  Interested to know how your accountant plans to deal with invoices in BTC.

I think this kind of statement is excellent.  Companies that embrace bitcoin and attempt to use it all along the supply chain as well as pledging not to cash out to fiat are going to be what changes the public's mindset about bitcoin from an 'investment' to a viable alternative to traditional currency.  I'm taking a similar (if much more lo-fi) approach in the store i've set up with every element from sourcing stock to sales conducted entirely in bitcoin - apart from the damn post office!

Ah - sorry mate - the only downside to that theme is that the designers idea of responsive on that header is 'interesting' at best.  
@_date: 2014-06-10 09:50:11
Thanks.  It's reassuring to know that I'm not alone.  I've got a few pals that i've set this up with but I'm not entirely sure that they aren't just humoring me just to shut me up.  
I wrote a blog post here that sums up my reasons for attempting this:

Thanks mate.  I was kind of verging on Michael Douglas 'Falling Down' style behaviour and thought that this would be a better outlet for my anger.  Even if it sell nowt it'll be cheaper than therapy.  
@_date: 2014-06-10 12:05:59
I'll bear that in mind but it doing that wouldn't be true to my aims - for better or for worse!

I'm English.
@_date: 2014-06-10 11:04:09
Cheers.  And again, sorry.   ;)
@_date: 2014-06-10 11:44:10
Fair point.  I'm have mixed emotions.  I think that the positivity and enlightenment that bitcoin brings is just the start.  If it really takes hold I  suspect that when the establishment truly understands what is occurring they won't give up without a fight.  Literally.  
@_date: 2014-06-09 14:01:41
Its a much smaller idea than Overstock.  To be honest its conceptual idea rather than something huge that's going to shock the world.   I just wanted to see if it were possible to bootstrap a company out of nothing using only suppliers that would agree to be paid in BTC.  Right now i've managed that - although due to the upfront BTC I was holding and the hurdles of insisting on paying with BTC means that I have limited but amusingly diverse stock!
Edited to add:  Obviously I think it could change the world but I am painfully idealistic rather than realistic.   :)
@_date: 2014-06-10 12:30:28
I am really interested in Darkcoin - if there was a woocommerce plugin that didn't need to be hooked up to an exchange i'd be all over it.  
@_date: 2014-06-10 12:26:54
I get what you are saying.  My view is that if it is a success then you use any profit to expand and in order to keep to the philosophy that just means finding partners and suppliers who will accept BTC.  If there ever comes a stage where the label ever holds enough cash to cash out - it will be because the alt currency world is in full swing.  At that point i'd use it to buy assets rather than worthless fiat  ;)

If I was told that MyLittlePonyCoin was gaining marketshare and had increased levels of anonymity over even Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 11:48:04
Haha.  You mad bastard.  I forgot to remove that and wondered who just bought it.   I'm hoping this was your clever way of bunging me a cheeky 'donation' as I'm a running a bit low on 'real cloaks of invisibility' right now. 
BTW - actually just shot pics of a couple of large ts - one blue short sleeved and a nice long sleeved black one that I was considering keeping to myself as i'm only a couple of kebabs a way from a large myself.  
@_date: 2014-06-10 13:03:53
This would be amazing.  Although - this service would need to be in the UK and shipping internationally.  
Edit: Sadly they look like USA only options for now.  Thanks for trying though mate.
@_date: 2014-06-10 22:27:58
hey mate - i'll drop you an email.   
@_date: 2014-06-10 14:20:39
Cheers mate.  Yeah - i spoke to the guy who developed the BTC plugin to see if he could add that to the rollout plan.  The concept would be purer if it only listed prices in mBTC
@_date: 2014-06-10 13:13:57
I like that mate.   I might use it if thats cool with you.  I'll swap your tagline for a shirt?
@_date: 2014-06-10 12:57:23
Yeah I don't quite have economies of scale enjoyed by Dollar Mart
@_date: 2014-06-10 13:15:50
Awesome mate.  Cheers.  I've been wondering how to promote the store as doing it anonymously means that I can't even use the few useful contacts that I have!
PM me your address if you like and I'll send you a shirt. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 12:08:07
I did have some ideas in mind - but they won't be the standard bitcoin logo stuff as there is plenty of that already.  It will be more John Heartfield photomontage style. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 09:48:28
Hmm.  Right now they have a currency that they create out of nothing and use to buy whatever assets they want including oil and land.  With Bitcoin they will no longer have that power.  On that basis I think we can probably accept that this legislation is about crushing Bitcoin rather than attempting to work with it.
I agree with people who say that engaging in dialogue with people like Ben Lawsky simply creates a narrative that any legislation has been reached by lengthy discussion with (whoever puts forward views) and that these views were taken into account.  And yet the new legislation will be exactly the same as proposed with perhaps a couple of amends that look like they are for our benefit but in fact just complicate things further.  
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:40:17
fair play to you managing to say that and not get downvoted like i did.
@_date: 2014-06-10 14:08:52
+1 for the bit about simplifying the technical explanation.   I can't count the number of times that I mention bitcoin and people go 'whoah - yeah - I wouldnt use it because I just don't understand how it works'.   My stock reply is: 'wait. are you telling me you understand exactly how wifi, microwave ovens or even cars work?  nope?  so what it is about bitcoin that suddenly makes it something you have know how it works in order to use it?'
@_date: 2014-06-10 09:57:36
hehe. I did have the page description: 'Ethical Clothing: Redefined' at one stage  :)
@_date: 2014-06-10 11:39:47
Nice one - I'll get on it.  I should add 'Why do you continually ignore your spell check?' on my FAQ.  :)
@_date: 2014-06-10 09:41:24
I'm working on getting hold of new stock but obviously only if there is demand.  Please feel free to msg me comments or bug reports.  It's possible that this might be a bit 'angst ridden' for some but the whole economic thing isn't working for me right now and Bitcoin just feels like the answer.  The aim of the project is to show how it is possible for bitcoin to replace fiat entirely with a little coercion and ingenuity. 
The Manifesto (for want of a better word) is.
Our suppliers are paid entirely using alt currency
Our garments can only be bought using alt currency
We vow never to transfer alt currency into fiat money
We will pay 20% of profit to charities that accept alt currency.
EDIT:  Woohoo.  Nice one Michael - 56 minutes in business and my first sale.  You sir are a legend!  
@_date: 2014-06-10 12:33:28
Yeah mate - will do.  Actually theres a newsletter - if you sign up on that you'll get any mailout about new designs.

I used to work in advertising until I got sick of it.  i guess ignoring the flashy paintwork and looking under the bonnet is an old habit.  
@_date: 2014-07-19 11:57:35
Right there with you.  No cashing out and out entire supply chain paid in Bitcoin.  Already selling to people in New York and have no intention to change that.  
I've also registered the url altcompanies.com with a view to making a list of pure alt companies who promise to keep it real and not cash out to fiat.  
@_date: 2014-06-09 09:12:41
Totally - agree.  I'm working on a similar project although the key is to convince all your suppliers to accept bitcoin to keep the concept pure.  Apart from the postal service - i've managed to make that happen.  edited to add: its kind of conceptual though - like a proof of concept rather than on the scale of Overstock etc!
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:53:58
If they are going to convert it straight back to USD I don't see how this is likely to increase the price of bitcoin.   Surely loads of people who hold bitcoin suddenly spending it with Expedia would be no different to loads of people holding bitcoin suddenly cashing out.
@_date: 2014-06-10 19:26:05
Yeah not sure what that was about - kinda of worried if traffic from r/bitcoin killed it.  Back up now though
@_date: 2014-06-10 12:52:07
We're based in London.  Right now the plugin doesnt allow for conversion into BTC until checkout.  I had a chat with the dev who said he hasnt had much call for displaying BTC against products right now but would have a look at how hard it would be to adapt it.  
@_date: 2014-06-11 20:08:43
I've used Cryptsy, BTC-E and Mintpal and found Mintpal to be the most usable and fastest to deposit and withdraw cash from.  It was actually way quicker when i ran a comparison of depositing BTC into the exchange, using it to buy another currency and then withdrawing that back to my local wallet.  In the time i'd completed this process with Mintpal - I was still waiting for my deposit into Cryptsy to clear.  Other peoples mileage my vary as this was a very unscientific one off test.  
@_date: 2014-06-10 13:35:19
Thats not a bad idea - at the very least it makes some sense of choosing wordpress as an ecommerce platform.  Although I should have probably started before I hooked up the suppliers..
@_date: 2014-06-10 11:03:29
Yeah fair point.  The girl who is getting the garments for me only grabbed a few XL and maybe one XXL - TBH i swerved adding them for now as they are a pain in the arse to photograph hanging.  I'll sort them shortly.
@_date: 2014-06-10 14:33:59
I kind of borrowed your idea. PM me an address and i'll bung you some coin.

Sad news.  I read a great article on Agorism on your site.  I'd never heard the term before and was reassured to find there was already a word for my personal 'belief system'.   Best of luck with your future endeavors.
