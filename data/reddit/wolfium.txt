Nice - please include the 2013 crash in there too for some perspective ;)
EDIT: Also... a logarithmic charts show equal percentage changes well.
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:15:42
This. Thanks for this perspective.

Based on the BCU/BTC value on  80%.
(1 - the_value)*100
EDIT: added formula

Yup.

What percentage of money do you think comes from taxes, rather than being taken directly by the government from the reserve bank?
@_date: 2016-12-28 07:11:28
less +F ~/.bitcoin/debug.log
also works nicely :)

"Arbitrage" is the word you're looking for.
EDIT: I've also heard people use the term "premium".

Conspiracy theory time!
Suppose you are the tether company. You want to make silly amounts of money...
1) Borrow lots of USD money from some bank
2) Create FUD in the tether-sphere
3) Buy tethers from panicking people who are selling their tethers cheaper than $1
4) Wait for FUD to go away (since it was created by us anyway)
5) Sell the tethers
6) Pay back the bank we borrowed money from
7) Keep the difference as... PROFIT!!!

Ok. I guess that's ok. $10 is 16 mBTC. So the winner gets 11 mBTC if method isn't explained and 16mTC if explained.

Because then **I** will buying all of them which would drive the price up!

It's almost never more lucrative. And if it is, it's only for a few hours here and there.

I guess having a "point" depends on your circumstances.
I don't have much trust in the people running my country and I think we can end up like Zimbabwe in 10-20 years.
I would use gold as an alternative, but I'm not sure that will be "portable" once the time comes to evacuate this country.
Also, in a corrupt world, having offshore account would leave you screwed if the overseas party decides to say "No, you don't have anything with us... what gave you that idea??" when your home country goes down the drain and you can do *nothing* against them.

Actually... that's what would happen if fiat crashes. Nice way of seeing it ;)

What's difference between the "normal" segwit (/Satoshi:0.14.1(UASF-SegWit-BIP148)/) and the other segwit (/Satoshi:0.14.1/UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148)/) ?

They charge you on the deposits/withdrawals of the underlying asset. That's where they make their money.
EDIT: And probably also the interest they earn when depositing the underlying in their banks.
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:55:34
What could cause a long term and widespread fiat crash?

Thanks :)
