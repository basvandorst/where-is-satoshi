It's a HARD "soft" fork. It prunes signatures into their own thing, which means previous clients are effectively castrated when it comes to verifying anything beyond "This is next block in chain." Segwit is dangerous, contentious, and frankly insane to propose applying to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-28 15:53:34
Seriously another person advocating seg wit as a hardfork just to make sure older nodes running software that works get knocked off the network.
@_date: 2015-12-28 11:42:38
No, drama boosts Bitcoin value. In anything we need to go closer to the brink and dive in.
@_date: 2015-12-28 15:23:58
So far none of the soft forks have been contentious or presented an opportunity for miners to steal.
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:43:13
But to the left or right?
@_date: 2015-12-23 23:12:03
And accepted. Holdouts with a stake in bitcoin (mining power, high HODL score) can effectively block or kill hardforks.

A node isn't a charity. It serves its operator by validating for them. If they don't trust the "updated" code they don't have to.

They might not trust newer versions to not be backdoored.
@_date: 2015-12-19 23:26:49
Why aren't you giving the segwit thing the XT treatment. It seems like just as serious of a break of the Blockchain's fundamental contract. Removing signatures from the blockchain is a rather substantial breach.
@_date: 2015-12-19 23:37:25

Literally anything else is better. Even [Popescu's Trilema]( is better. There is absolutely no place in Bitcoin for GAW related scammers and shills like these fucks and Marshall Long. None.
At least when Popescu rants people don't get scammed for it. Even when Oliver Janssens goes on a racist tirade people don't lose money. These, calling them people seems too charitable, who play scambusters while promoting bigger scams have no place anywhere.

But, now follow me here. If you have enough varied inputs including virginal mined coins... You can simulate the mixing all on your own. Follow coins to the destination? Sure, this can be done with all coins. Reducing the certainty that the person spending the coins is the person who had been hodling them for so long? Perfectly reasonabru.

Throw the coins around addresses you control. Maybe you do it by hand, maybe you automate with some scripts but you jumble your hoard around a bit an break off a chunk to use as spendable money while the rest goes back to sleep or gets a bit more tumbling before sleeping. The idea though is so long as you restrict your spending to a subset of the coins which you can offer some pretext for receiving, it is hard to prove the rest of the hoard is yours.

Lighthouse required Bitcoin nodes which served a new datatype to anyone who requests it. Preparing and transimitting these new messages took lots of CPU and in Mike's implementation of this could end up with messages over 32 MB getting pushed out on the Bitcoin network.
Decentralized is good, but it needs solid foundations and not crap that makes the nodes supporting it more vulnerable.

Mining on it would be pointless, but running a node on it is fine. With a bit beefier machine you could experiment with running an electrum server and eventually run all of your other wallets off of your full node.
@_date: 2016-02-06 12:43:43
You can also send tiny amounts to your own addresses until you get a confirm on the ClassicCoin chain and then double spend on the Bitcoin chain with a higher fee (No RBF required). This way you don't have to toss anything of value at the ClassicCoin Coup to dump on their chain. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 00:38:31
This doesn't work. The addresses themselves are valid on both chains. What matters is confirmed coins being moved. For safety, and so this works at all, you need coins confirmed differently on both chains post fork.
@_date: 2016-02-02 13:14:08
Set it up as a node, and play with the command line calls. Maybe practice writing code that interfaces with it? Or you can just work on your linux sysadmin skills while maintaining your Pi2 node as a sort of zen rock garden?
The nice thing about having the Pi2 already is you already have it and can get to work learning from it. As long as you don't disable bloom filters, you can use it as a trusted node for any BitcoinJ based light wallets you have, if that's a thing you do.

But... they skipped the blog post?
@_date: 2016-02-02 09:39:23
They were the same for a while, but GPU and later ASIC mining separated out the mining function as they made CPU mining by nodes uncompetitive.
A node has great value though. It allows you to verify your own copy of the blockchain so that you might keep miners honest. You could also get mining hardware and have it mine off of your node.
Running your own node though is a prerequisite for fully participating in the Bitcoin network. Once you run a node all sorts of opportunities open up.

Another alternative is renting a cheap dedicated box. I've seen some as low as $20/month for old hardware, but its hard to verify that you have the actual hardware and not a VPS instance. The next tier up is buying a box and sticking it somewhere, there's places that do tower server colocation for about $40 a month.
@_date: 2016-02-16 21:00:14
Apparently they didn't but they talk to the person who did. Seriously though, have you never read the DNS seed code, it invokes this particular call rather frequently so yes by removing this shit the developers of this client eliminated this vulnerability in advance.

In a whole "bowl" full of them weeds.
@_date: 2016-02-16 17:38:42
Seriously. Can the core developers of ALL the affected clients comment?
@_date: 2016-02-07 00:46:10
Yes. The part where Core considers the transaction invalid. Addresses don't become invalid because they are in forked blocks. You gotta get mined on classic, then doublespend with greater fee on core and get that mined. While you do this just make sure all the addresses being sent to are ones you have the keys for, because you might have to try this a few different times for the miners to fork your coins. If they mine the same transactions on both forks, you can just keep rolling these until they work.
You take on tremendous risk if you don't get the transactions mined on different sides though.
@_date: 2016-02-03 22:58:34
Even in opensource software your reputation takes a hit when you don't disclose places reviewers should direct extra attention. Armory rightly got spanked in public. That keep trying to divert from why the public spanking was necessary strengthens the case for it.
