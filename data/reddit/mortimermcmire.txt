How many of these are unique transactions and not just a handful of groups painting the tape?

Why would you spend money on a candy bar when it can buy 2 candy bars tomorrow?

That's fine, not arguing price direction. Just saying that if it only goes down, dca doesnt work

dca doesn't work if it only goes down over time

How does a loss in purchasing power affect me? I put money into growth assets. If anyone leaves money in a bank doing nothing they're an idiot. Money is inflationary to make people NOT keep it in a bank and want to spend it, which makes the whole economy work in general

cycles dont imply magnitude, only direction. are you telling me you expect bitcoin to cycle infinitely and that fast? that is....optimistic to say the least

past performance doesnt indicate future results

This. Markets dont react to known events. Its what's known as being 'priced in'.
@_date: 2019-10-18 16:59:23
in 2013 it was largely unknown what the effect would have, i'm sure most people who traded bitcoin didn't treat the whitepaper as religious gospel and care about the underlying market. Now that bitcoin is so intensely scrutinized and traded as an asset instead of merely a means to acquire drugs, those unknowns have become much more understood.
in 2013 bitcoin wasn't really a market in the macroeconomic sense

thats why if you have a brainstem you put it into assets like real estate or index funds
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:48:48
Independent market events, please dont reply to me anymore you brainlet
