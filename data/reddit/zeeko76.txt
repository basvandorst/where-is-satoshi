Hey DeDarDen, do you have an update for us? A colleague of mine is in a similar situation.

Those loose lending policies are inherently bound to the fiat money system. Just lower the interest rates to boost growth. It is precisely this policy that caused the housing bubble and how did they fight it? Even lower interest rates. Even bigger bubbles.
Don't repeat that lie that banks tried to trick people into buying houses. This happens maybe on the individual level but you cannot rationally blame scams for macroeconomic developments.
Never said that crypto is a bubble or not.

The market, i.e. individuals, would decide under which conditions and at which rate and not a gang of unelected managers that are exposed to the influence of lobbyists and that have to please politicians.


Yes, because the monetary policy of the central bank made it look like those people could afford these loans.

What if i told you that the Fiat Money system created the housing bubble prior to 2007 and is currently creating many other bubbles?
How come many cities suffer from housing shortage, yet no one wants to invest in building new houses in many of these cities?
