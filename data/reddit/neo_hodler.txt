When the transaction fees decreasing further. This means that less transactions will send to the network in comparison to the tx which can be included in blocks (=confirmed).
I would say currently is the avg tx fee at 38 sat/B.

I hope so. Currently I let run the btc.com restore script. But it can take more than a day until all of my addresses were found. But it looks like it is the only way to get it back. Thank you for your help.

You have set up something like child pays for parent:
The transactions to the address from which you sent it further are unconfirmed. When a miner want to include your transaction, he have to include the other transactions as well. So you can calculate the fee/Byte by sum all bytes and all sat from the unconfirmed transactions which have to be included.
I think this will lower your sat/Byte?

I tried MultiBit HD, but I can't import my keys, only seeds.
Armory only generates addresses which begins with 1.
Do you know any wallet which can handle it?

Thanks, but it can only restore by a seed.

I'm sorry. Read your transactions not carefully enough. All transactions from your input addresses are confirmed.
When the fees decreasing further it should be confirmed today.

Yes for sure. Have a nice day!
When it needs too long you can contact me. I will explain you some tricks how you can speed it up. But would cost some $$

hopefully someone can help me.
I had a wallet at btc.com and can't access it because I've lost some account information.
But I have my backup pdf and my wallet password. So I recovered 2 xprv and 1 xpub key, but when I want to use them with electrum, it shows me wrong addresses.
Do anyone know a wallet which can handle this keys and derive the correct addresses, so I can restore my coins?
As far as I know I need a bip32 MultiSig HD Wallet (addresses begins with 3). Is this correct?

could you please add NEO and all nep5 tokens which are stored at the address for address tracking?
Would be awesome.
Great work. I've searched a long time for such a software and had it In my mind to develop something similar (But only for private use).
Thank you!

Whats happening when the difficulty increases until all numbers have to be zero? How should the difficulty increase?

To be sure to have the future money in your portfolio, you should buy 1000 tokens of every coin.
Then you have the butter coin (tokenized butter), but if you want to buy meat, you have to exchange it to meat coin (12:1) and bread coin (18:1 or 1,5:1 meat/bread).

No one would care about the exchange rate to fiat, when it will be used ;)

When is the next token burn?

When you can see the transaction is verified by the network and the coins "arrived" at the correct address from livecoin, there is no mistake by the sender. The basics of Bitcoin are following simple rules.
I think livecoins support should handle such thinks with more professionalism. Do they have a subreddit? Then you could ask there as well with more publicity.

First of all: Why are you using this small exchange? They have large spreads and higher fees as other exchanges.
To your problem: I think they meant you've used many inputs in one transaction.
This is normal when working with wallets with many small amounts on different addresses.
But I really don't understand their problem.
In fact you send your coins to an address which  is owned by them (livecoin has the pk).

Is he going to a shop with 43k Bitcoins in his wallet??

Why he released this video in dec 2018? It had helped me more in 2010!
