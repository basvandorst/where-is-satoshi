If you don't trust a cloud provider (and realistically, you shouldn't fully trust *any* cloud service), then just put everything on there in an encrypted folder. TrueCrypt would suit that need nicely.

Thanks! And I've done the research for the rig I have, I'm not expecting to make a ton of money. It would be a couple of bucks a day, max, but I figure that's still a few "free" beers each week.

They shipped some review/demo units. As far as anyone can tell, they have yet to ship to any non-media customers. Their backlog is literally a year long at this point, so if you order now, you *might* get your unit this fall. By that point, the network difficulty will have risen so much that a Jalapeno wouldn't even be powerful enough to pay itself off.

According to the forum post, partial withdrawals will be enabled tonight. Users will be able to withdraw half their balance now, and the remaining half in two weeks.

btcQuick.com lets you buy Bitcoins with a credit or debit card. It's not anonymous though, you make the payments through Google Wallet. Also there's a pretty hefty fee.

For now I'm just using Blockchain.info with 2-factor authentication enabled. 
Then again, I don't really have an amount worth stealing. Once I do have an amount worth stealing I'll probably put my security knowledge to work.

Having previously worked for the government, I can tell you with confidence that it's not done deliberately to break search functions. It's done this way because a bunch of un-tech-savvy people are in charge and doing it this way is easier for them to understand. Give it ten years or so for the old folks to retire and I'm sure you'll see some progress.

I'm totally new to Bitcoins. I want to start casually mining, since I'm away from my personal computer most of the time and I don't pay for my own electricity anyway. Are there penalties for only mining 12-16 hours a day, rather than having a dedicated mining rig working 24/7? I'm looking to join mtred as my primary pool, if that helps answer the question.

Personally, I'm going to be keeping an eye on both of them. Doesn't hurt to hold on and see which one actually delivers on their promises first.

[BTCQuick.com]( already provides this service at a 7.5% fee. The only catch is you have to provide proof of identity to register. For the more privacy-minded, this may be a deal-breaker.

Like I said, I'm totally new to all this. Can you tell me a little more about Litecoin? I did some cursory research and it looks like it's friendlier on GPU-based rigs, but that's basically all I know.

Give me some credit. I'm lazy, not stupid ;)

I'm trying to get set up to buy, but I can't find a map with cash exchange locations and bank wires take too long :/

Not really. From what I've gathered, Liberty Reserve was a centralized system. Bitcoin is decentralized so it's fundamentally different, although you could easily use Bitcoin for the same purposes that LR was used for.

I didn't downvote you, but if I had to take a guess I'd say you were downvoted because your comment was inane at best.

I was about to ask the same thing. I just bought two PT shares earlier this week so I'm really looking forward to seeing some dividends.
@_date: 2013-06-14 14:42:16
I'm definitely interested, but I'm a little hesitant to pre-order this far in advance from the estimated shipping date. Maybe come back with a reminder in a few months?

Blockchain.info supports 2-factor authentication.

That's not the point, the point is that many people are still unsure of the idea of an all-digital currency. It makes them uncomfortable. They want something physical. And while physical bitcoins do exist, they're hardly common as they're an inefficient way of transferring funds.
