Or once we have seen low-fee scaling implemented. This in itself highlights the purpose/benefits of off-chain scaling. He probably doesn't need the small tip right now, but can immediately use it to contribute to others.

TBH I thought something similar at first but as with all crypto things if you spend 10 seconds on something you're going to miss the point. Take a look beyond the hype video, they get decent guests and have made some solid trade calls/project insight - Fred's energy grows on you pretty quick.

It may be worth noting that this is an index of interest, not a measure of volume. 
I took a look for "bitcoin etf" in the Google AdWords keyword planner tool. 
Set to global, there was 3.6k searches per month on average last year (increasing over time), however this rose to 6.6k in December and 12.1k in January. 
It'll be interesting to see how February clocked in when it's updated :)
Ps - I'd take AdWords estimates with a pinch of salt but it's a good place to get a rough idea. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:56:24
Not a worry. I hadn't seen it on r/bitcoin.
I've been getting alerts for news around the ETF for the last while and have seen a notible shift in the last few days to reports stating a friday deadline. 
Just doing what I can to help out, perhaps others haven't seen it.

I'm more confident every day that the Bitties are a good hodl.
My best efforts to remove the rose coloured glasses struggle to find much to worry about.
The main thing i'm watching for is the creation of a more promising coin but I suspect there'll be plenty of notice for those of us that lurk often.
Hodl away my friend, savings can be recouped but I feel this risk reward is a rare occurance.
It's hard to put eggs in more than one basket when I feel that this badass basket has been forged by a community of the most forward thinking and dilligent minds in the world.

They didn't do the right thing - the right was lost with the mistake in the transaction, as unfortunate as that is. 
However, they certainly did do a very kind thing :)

edit: in a comment above has pointed out the flaw in my thoughts below.
I think that now you have identified a vulnerable wallet on the network, the BTC should be moved into a new wallet in the finders control. This supports the goal of securing &amp; returning the funds. 
Doing this further prevents the potential for future crackers to target the wallet, as the vulnerability is now know. 
The issue then becomes whether the original wallet holder will happen to look and see if a message was stored on the blockchain, associated with the transaction. Perhaps this is a good opportunity for us to establish a little hand-gesture we can use?
If we move funds from the Original wallet (a), into our own wallet (b) - before returning them to (a), and finally again moving into the secure wallet, (b). We can attempt to signal to the original owner that something unusual has happened. 
When looking at the wallets balance, I think it's somewhat likely that a person expecting to find BTC, will notice the unusual movements when they see the amount they are missing at first left their wallet, returned for a moment, and was moved again. An oddity.
If we could move for this to be a standard flagging indicator, it offers more than the opportunity to readily identify an indicator of a message. 
If an individual or group controlled multiple wallets of their own, (removing the priate key compromise component of the above) they could freely do this indicator to broadcast to the network that the transaction contains content, without the need to also share through another communication means.
Searching the network for these occuraces would identify instances where someone wishes to publically broadcast to the network that their transaction contains a message. This would be as opposed to the current means where we do the opposite, broadcasting publically/online that a message contains content. It could be a way to ping the strangers of the network to have a look if their curiosity takes them. Great potential for treasure hunts.

@_date: 2017-09-06 02:21:50
To be honest, I'm not sure of an example. 
BTCx2 can implement a change to addresses on their chain that would make it invalid on the original Bitcoin blockchain. This would resolve the issue, but see below for why they don't want to do this. 
I'm not 100% on this, but I think Bitcoin Core may have some ways to implement a change to protect against this - but i'm really not sure on the technicals here. 
My position is that there is a responsibility that falls on the developers that build a hard fork to take reasonable steps to ensure protection against loss.
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:07:26
Theft may be the wrong word. Perhaps accidental loss could be more appropriate, as the recipient may not be aware this is happening either. In this case - it would be an accidental gain to who is receiving the payment. 
When the fork occurs, both chains will consider all historical transactions as valid, meaning you will have the same amount of Bitcoin as before, on both chains. But BTCx2 doesn't offer a way for the original chain to distringuish transactions on BTCx2 as being separate and invalid.  The BTC chain will recognise BTCx2 transactions as valid BTC transactions also.
This means when I send you 1x BTCx2, it can be replayed on the BTC chain, and also deliver 1x BTC of mine, over to an address to which you contorl the pricate key. My loss! 
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:27:18
 
This is what you're looking for :) 
@_date: 2017-09-06 02:19:00
I believe so. 
If the BTCx2 hard fork adds replay protection, it will need to wait for adoption/upgrades across SPV clients who will otherwise be compatible. This is what happened to BCH where we saw wallets roll-out compatibility. I feel they're being dodgy trying to avoid this effort simply so they're immediately compatible on SVP clients (at the risk of others).
They argue that they don't need this protection since there was an agreement, everyone should just follow the agreement and immediately use the BTCx2 chain, however it's not wise to grant just a few groups who make agreeemnents behind closed doors this power to demand influence. The ecosystem consists of developers, exchanges, miners, retailers and users. If they're not all largely in agreement before a hard fork where there isn't replay protection - the entire ecosystem suffers greater risk. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:02:43
Several issues I think. 
1) There's a community who don't want BTCx2, they largely see this as an effort by miners further financial and contol interests over Bitcoin.
2) How we process it in our mind is really up to the individual's internal accounting. There's going to be a period where both coins have value. So it's fine to bucket it in your mind and say it never existed while waiting for one chain to become dominate, but there is a reality that you would be ignoring the fact that there is now two blockchains that offer different capabilities to which you have coins on both. While gifted to you by virtue of economic markets placing a value on each chain, and this is percievably unfair/magical - they still both have a real economic value. 
Throughout the initial period, if one has increased support it will become valued higher than the other. 
Without clear separation over the two chains, people that are unaware of this may spend their btcx2 for something and inadvertantly be gifting the same figure btc even though they could have essentially paid less for the item, had they used the higher value chain. (Let's assume BTC was valued greater than BTCx2).
It's easy to think that you don't 'deserve' the 'free coins', and admittedly it is unintuitive to think it makes any sense at all to begin with, but you're about to be the owner of a coins on two competing blockchains, and one coin may become worth more than the other - why would you be happy for someone to let you lose that?

0.25% on 10 small trades amounting to 1BTC is the same as 0.25% on one trade of 1BTC.

Agreed the thief shouldn't just get away without issue, but I do think there is a level of merit to focusing greater attention towards those that maintain or develop a position of leadership. 
People in positions of power need to be held to a higher standard. We should be wary of people with a track record of dishonesty and deception, regardless of how genuine their good intentions may be. Some people wish well but for one reason or another repeatedly find themselves unable to deliver actions that drive toward that intention.

I recommend sharing resources with your brother and uncle that helps them learn and understand the fundamentals of the technology they're investing in. 
Looking at different pricing information or technical analysis can be helpful, however it won't protect them from instances where large groups of people who don't fully understand 
the technology get behind something - such as bitconnect. 
Learning more about the technology, even from a non-technical perspective, will enable them to identify red flags, ask the right questions, and know how to find more information to independantly answer their questions. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:46:23
That's kind of the point - to show where the community lays their trust &amp; suupport. 
I know what my position is, but I think we need to create a way for others to be able to 'see' for themselves. 
Forks exist by inflating the perception that they have a supporting community.

Anyone can audit and even identify butt-duplication across votes, perhaps flagging for removal. 
I'm down to have this be some insanely secure website with butts stored on the blockchain or whatever, but in all honestly - I'm not a developer, so this would depend entirely on if we're able to attract people with experience that are looking for a few nights of fun contributing to a project.
If it grows, then we could look at how we might be able to reward contributors etc - but really this is about giving everyone with an ass a means to show their vote.
Thoughts? :)

Mmm! Sounds interesting. 
Why would this cause more damage than early signaling of their intention to pull out?
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:05:47
Careful!! This is a false analogy. (I'm not attacking, providing feedback! &lt;3)
You're right saying that the hardfock blocksize increase is like adding new buses to address not enough seating. (aka not enough space for transactions).
However, the idea that Segwit is only re-ogranising the initial bus to fit more people doesn't extend the analogy far enough to provide for the off-chain scaling as part of the value segwit brings. It makes it sound like the problem isn't resolved. What happens after you re-organise the first bus and then it gets full?
Segwit is a way of restructing data in the blockchain that in addition to optimising space within a block (this is where the bus analogy ends), creates a way for solutions such as the lightning network to come into play. It's these solutions that will provide scale, by enabling off-chain scaling. 
An example for lightning might be opening a bar tab. I send my 1BTC to a special type of bar tab and pay the transaction fee. Throughout the night of drinking and buying rounds for friends, rather than paying each time with a fee, I insted provide the bar tender with a signature that gives them the right for 1 beer, 2 beers, 3 beers + 1 wine (just in btc values). Each time I provide a signature for a beer, the bar tender gains the ability to immediately withdraw the increasing amount of BTC from the tab that I have put up. This means I can't run away without paying. 
This also means the bar tender cannot take more than I have signed for, creating a trustless relationship. At the end of the night we pay the fee to finalise the bar tab with 0.8 BTC going to the bar tender and 0.2 back to me. We both benefit from not neeing to pay a transaction fee each time a beer was purchased, and we both were safe knowing that we'd get out BTC when we wanted. 
With lightning, you move transaction activity off-chain, but 'peg' back as often as necessary for your personal risk management, as this provides you with the security of the blockchain (whichever one you're using). If you're doing microtransactions for seconds spent watching videos, you might finalise the bill every $50, paying the fee, rather than for the 1000's of transactions. If you are recognised as a trusted user of the streaming service, maybe they'll finalise every $1000 instead, lowering the total cost of fee's further. 
Miners love fees. 
Segwit = off-chain scaling = less fees.
Big blocks = more fees. 
It's not a bus, it's a magic AF bus. haha.

Looking at the responses so far I think there's one component that's worth understanding. 
The community behind Bitcoin is what decides change. 
This community consists of 5 parties, of which there can be varying levels of influence at different times.
- Developers - who propose and submit changes to the protocol of the blockchain. This can be anyone.
- Miners - who elect to implement the protocol that is aligned with their values/incentives.
- Merchants - who elect which blockchain they use to capture value. 
- Exchanges - who list and facilitate the on and off ramps (at least currently) into the ecosystem
- Users - who elect to use the blockchain in question. 
None of these parties are more important than the other, in terms of building a sustainable ecosystem, and balance can be found through competition and exit if any party gains too much control.  
(edit: wording)
