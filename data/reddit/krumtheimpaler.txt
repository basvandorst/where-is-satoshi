I've always known ubuntu to be a fickle creature, I prefer tails these days
@_date: 2014-06-06 01:03:00
see my post above, I would use tails in this situation.  I think that would mitigate key loggers, the rest is up to you.  
@_date: 2014-05-07 04:21:29
I don't think with this setup I will, but this has been an area of nerdery I didn't know anything about.  I figured it would be a nominal cost to familiarize myself with the territory and get started at the very least.  By virtue of the infrastructure the unit is infinitely expandable.    Plus, I found out tonight the system only drains 12w.
also, from here, moving on to mining other crypto currency is a small jump, considering last week I didn't have a clue how it all worked.  I'm just excited to have an understanding of it all....at last.

I hope for my sake, I'm living off the grid in the mountains by the time this comes to pass.  Truly scary stuff there bruv!  Wonderfully done.

what this guy did was the equivalent of leaving your wallet on the bus, explain to me how this is indicative of what your implying.  
@_date: 2014-12-28 21:31:45
its drugs, mostly drugs

Thanks, unfortunately I still have the chase card, but thats only for travel so I can cut the line in airport security, worth the 99 bucks a year.

@_date: 2014-06-04 13:25:36
you assume too much, who said I'm living off your taxes?  I've done very well for myself.  So much so, I needn't find a job anytime soon.  Also, I have a steady income generated by my own business.  
@_date: 2014-12-06 18:28:35
Having your coins in cold storage should be but the tip of your security iceberg.  Secondly I'd make your moves and create your wallet addresses in an amnesic OS like tails, creating wallets offline all the while and only release private keys once.  People must keep in mind that being your own bank means running your own security and you clearly did not.  Stories like these are bad for bitcoin.  You should be asking people how you can improve your security rather than rounding up a posse.  
@_date: 2014-06-03 17:52:14
Ha! I'm not trying to live off it
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:28:30
I'm also mining right now, got a  little 32 gh/s rig, I enjoy being a part of it all.  
@_date: 2014-06-06 02:27:17
If you've got one usb drive, you've probably got two, a little double penetration would solve that quick, fast and in a hurry.  
@_date: 2014-05-07 15:11:00
I think each block eruptor was 30 bucks, I had just about everything else on hand. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:24:16
I need to find a bar within stumbling distance that accepts bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-24 21:59:47
running tails off a usb stick essentially does this for you.  
@_date: 2014-06-03 22:26:10
no, just that BoA sucks major chode
@_date: 2014-05-07 15:12:43
Yup, thinking about that, I've got about 30 w of monocrystalline around here already, I'd imagine to get it to run all day I'd have to up that some.  
@_date: 2014-06-05 23:33:31
nah, not me
@_date: 2014-06-06 01:05:25
This is wonderful, I'm curious to know the conduit you used on your smartphone to finalize the sale.  
@_date: 2014-05-07 04:47:32
its an important thing to know, I think that offsets the cost.  I just like seeing those green lights blink, doin math, makin me money, after that, I don't care much about the cost.  
@_date: 2014-05-24 23:18:42
Not exactly true.  rEFInd is very good between tails and OSX.  The more labor intensive process is checking that the distro you have is a legitimate copy and getting it onto the stick.  
If you've done it successfully even once, its like riding a bike, you don't really forget.  
Also, from there once you have a stick, you can create copies of tails on USB sticks very easily from the tails installer within tails, but here is where you have a point (and with the fickleness of the different varieties of sticks of course).  I've found that tails installs done from the tails installer don't tend to work with Mavericks.  I find being relegated to the long way isn't so bad.  
Small price to pay for very very good security.  edit: Plus, I got a free 8gb stick from amazon this way, I got a new one just for tails which didn't end up working, I returned it and they said "fuck it, just keep it".  
@_date: 2014-06-03 17:48:28
a couple antminer s1's should do it
@_date: 2014-06-03 17:49:04
yeah, seems to take a while
@_date: 2014-06-28 03:58:28
I'm not so sure, legally speaking, I'm only soliciting the person or persons who have already provided me with said magical internet sustenance.

have a donut @_date: 2014-06-28 01:38:24
thats fine, and I'm fine with whatever happens to my posts.  It would be a shitty existence if one were to get pissed off about shit like that.  I ran it up the flag pole and nobody saluted, we all move on.

I don't run into password protected BIOS, most times F2, F12 or ESC will access boot menu on windows PC, option key on a Mac.

Here is 1 donut on me! @_date: 2014-06-28 01:31:02
ahh, its a changetip account, so its linked to my reddit.  I can prove with screenshots if necessary.  
edit: checked my profile age, at 8 months, approx 243 and one third days, but we're at the end of the month, so that makes sense.

yes, and Brian Peppers, convicted sex offender.

I didn't even want to click on this thread, I clicked on the comments first, much safe
@_date: 2014-06-28 04:08:56
have an internet @_date: 2015-05-19 11:15:04
I have a friend that when last we spoke he was going to africa to work on exactly this.  I guess he did a good job.  
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:27:54
This is good advice, taken.  
@_date: 2016-03-03 04:23:36


@_date: 2014-06-06 01:01:22
life pro tip: if you don't have a smart phone, carry a copy of tails on a usb stick, that way any computer can become a safe-er computer.  Remember, security is only as good as you allow it to be.  
@_date: 2016-12-01 03:39:24
haha, we're terrible
@_date: 2015-04-27 16:24:53
Wow, really amazing stuff there.  Everyone should jump at the opportunity to give you money because its so easy.  
@_date: 2015-04-08 15:03:14
@_date: 2015-04-27 03:18:13
thats all?  That sounds so easy.  
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:41:15
I've already answered this question and more.  Read my words more closely.  
@_date: 2015-03-15 12:05:38
Here is the bitcoin disconnect whenever I talk about it with my roommate, you've got it wrong.  If you choose to look at it like an investment thats all its ever going to do for you.  Its so much more than that.  Here is what I tell that asshole.  You only lose on the bitcoin you spend, you know it's going to go down, you know its going to go up, just don't spend the shit you payed more for than what its currently valued at, buy more and spend the lot you didn't when the value returns to a level that way you never lose and you can have all the drugs.
