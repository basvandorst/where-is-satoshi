Man. I can't believe i used to successfully mine with a desktop. Seems like a dream now....

Yep. Keep my bitcoin savings in a paper wallet. Worry free since june 2013. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 01:09:04
Yep, raising awareness is a valid reason. Just saying, it's not going to prevent anything from happening on a technical level, which is sorta the definition of a filibuster. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 17:34:55
would watch the world burn if it meant to the moon guy making an appearance. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:51:15
This filibuster is purely for show. They will vote on it before the week is over anyways.

Casual Bitcoin guy here, what's a good alternative for monitoring the chain?
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:46:29
Fortunately they were out of stock with the item I want. I'll be buying later. ha. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 17:06:20
You know they post the transcripts of all their meetings, right? lol

Are there any other supporters of bitcoin that AREN'T end the fed die-hards? I feel like i'm the exception around here. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 17:06:06
Maybe I'm in the minority but I don't exactly long for the "pre-fed days" 
The fed was one of the main reasons we didn't totally implode during the great recession. In fact, I'd argue THAT was the MOST important difference. 1929 crash wasn't based on anything aside from speculation, and it's impact was long and deep. The 08 crash had much more deep rooted causes, and with the power of the fed we didn't fall off the cliff.

people may trade in gold and silver, but they definitely do not use it as a currency.
@_date: 2016-06-04 14:15:49
Yes. I just don't consider that a REAL possibility. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:41:24
I'd say generally many economists saw it coming, finding the specific spark was going to trigger it was the difficult part. Subprime mortgages ended up being that spark. 
Lack of transparency on where these "toxic" mortgages lied within large portfolios of assets caused a panic in the banking system. Credit froze. more panic. more freeze. more panic. 
So basically extremely large, black box, investments spread through the finance system + a spark, results in a collapse.

You buy a smartphone because you want a smartphone. In theory, this item creates *utility* in your life. Not having that *utility* immediately has a cost associated with it. As a rational agent, you weight that cost of purchasing now vs. later. If the utility provided by having an smartphone now outweights the cost of not having one and waiting for the next iteration, you make a purchase. 
Now with currency, it has no inherent *utility* outside it's purchasing power. So if you think the purchasing power will increase in the future, there is no incentive to spend now. Spending is the ONLY THING you can do with currency.
THEY ARE NOT SUBSTITUTES FOR ANALYSIS.

"few economists outside acedemia" so, people who haven't actually studied econ? lol
I know I'm in the minority around these parts with degrees in economics, but the deflationary nature of Bitcoin is a fatal design flaw in terms of replacing fiat. gold only worked as a currency when the promise of more was always on the horizon, once we more or less mined it all it's effectiveness as a currency started to do.more harm than good. Deflationary currency discourages spending full stop. 
now, I'm long on Bitcoin, and super duper long on crypto currency in general, but we have to stop echo chambering out bitcoins weaknesses. this particular issue is a factor that will absolutely prevent it from becoming a full mainstream currency. believing otherwise is hodl propoganda to pump up the price.
and as for all the government tickery talk, I can't get behind that. you're basically saying the gov exploits interest and deferred payments to pay for things today. aren't they very open about that? I bought a house in today's money and am banking on paying it off in future money. it's not just a benefit to the gov, it's a benefit to anyone with a plan.

Obviously, we're going to a agree to disagree on a lot of this. I will check out some further reading on Austrian Business Cycle theory as i haven't put much effort into it as of yet. 
I'm not one of those people that find the current system infallible, i just don't wanna undervalue the length of expansions and general stability we've had since going off the gold standard. I also find it a little hard to believe that all of the mainstream economist have been tricked into helping out the rich cronies of the US. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:09:40
this is meme talk. you can't just pick any example the proves your point without proving the two items in your analagy are actually analogous. hard goods and currency and not things you can freely substitute.

I had 3 non-bank of america credit cards. Over the years they all became bank of america cc's. cool.

Yea, it wouldn't hurt to reign in the deficit a bit, but it's not exactly a "the sky is falling" scenario. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:28:27
I'd argue mining is the same a printing money. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:23:04
Ha, i'd say blockchain is the engine and bitcoin is the model car you're choosing to drive.

Oh my god. What an original and accurate way to put it. Thanks for dropping in and making this comment. You've enlightened us all with your wit and creativity.

I've been here since the GPU mining days, and my weak stomach got the better of me. I cashed out before this latest bump, and I feel kinda silly. Shoulda held on to a few coins at least. Helped me put a down payment on a house, so no regrets i suppose. (but its really hard to not think about how i could have put down a full 20% if i just waited a few months) 
Oh well, just waiting for the right time to buy back in. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:05:46
I don't know the exact percent, just reported the same way i report my stock gains. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:16:21
Why would they do that when i reported my gains on my taxes?
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:44:09
So an incentive to save instead of spend is good? This sub in insane.....

Ha, I didn't realize there were still SO MANY HATERS. People posting about Tulip bulbs, claiming you can never cash out bitcoin. I guess I'll just never understand people's rage towards btc.

It's an entirely new thing, and we're still sorting out exactly what it is, and how it's going to work with the real economy.

Ha, I went through the whole "checkout" process on the site to see how it works. They only accept direct money transfer as payment. AKA the money is gone forever with no chance of a chargeback.

Haha exactly. I have my next little BTC nest egg, and 1080p gaming heaven. Win win.

Really good over all. I just wish "double-spend" wasn't something they mentioned near the start, and then didn't bother to fully explain. As we all know the "double Spend" issue has caused some controversy around the community, as it's kinda hard to explain. I feel like it's not worth mentioning unless you're going to take the time to explain it fully. It just sounds scarier than it actually is without a full explanation. 
@_date: 2013-09-23 02:30:24
VERY interesting. They'll need to get that price point way down to drive mainstream adoption, though.
