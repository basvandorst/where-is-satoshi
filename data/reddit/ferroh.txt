The amount of heat you need in your water is usually high. Your bitcoin miner doesnt want all that heat next to it. It wants to slightly heat a large amount of water, not greatly heat a small amount of water (which is what you want for your shower).
Heating your home can work, but it doesn't make sense unless you already use electric heat or have high confidence in a long term plan to continuously swap out the miner with newer tech.
When the miner becomes obsolete (~1-2 years) then you essentially just have an electric heater until you upgrade it.
At the end of the day all this is only worth it if the cost of electricity (in the cheapest places in the world) is large compared to manufacturing cost. And I didn't even mention the cost of installing a very small mining farm into a single home.
Bottom line: It probably doesn't make sense to do what you suggest.

Consider what happens when you browse the web:
1. When you visit a website you get a link to the website server machine via a URL (e.g.: 
2. Then the server machine tells your web client data and you see the site.
Now BIP70:
1. With BIP70 you get a URL to the receiving bitcoin merchant machine (e.g. payment.reddit.com).
2. Then the merchant machine sends your bitcoin client data and your bitcoin client uses it to make payment (your client and the merchant machine can now communicate about which addresses to use).


The URL can still be tampered with in the way that you can get phished today by visiting "p4ypal.com" instead of paypal.com. But if you check that the URL is right then you don't get phished and the addresses can't get tampered with for the same reason that my SSL encrypted communication with you over reddit.com right now isn't being tampered with.

Get a Trezor and Mycelium together (so that Mycelium needs the trezor to sign your transactions).

Nothing. The same reasoning applies to both sets of technologies.
- If the internet becomes widespread then it solves many problems. (It did, but didn't necessarily have to.)
- If bitcoin becomes widespread then it solves many problems. (It hasn't yet, it might, it might not.)
- If Napster becomes widespread then it can solve many problems. (It didn't. Torrenting did that instead. If Napster became widespread it *would* have benefited many though.)


Surely you can see how short sighted this reasoning is though?
It is much easier in some places to obtain bitcoin than others, and ways of getting bitcoins can change dramatically in the future. Whether you think these changes will happen is up to you to decide for yourself. If they happen then bitcoin is undervalued right now, if they don't then bitcoin is perhaps even overvalued.
Either way, this isn't really what your original question is about, or I didn't think that it was.

The "tech know-how" to mine on a CPU was to open a program and wait for coins to show up in your wallet. (Mining on CPU automatically happened by default in early versions of bitcoin-qt.) 
GPU mining was not much more complex, unless you're talking about scaling up a big operation and squeezing out every percent of efficiency, which was not required for early mining.
People became complacent with gox because storing coins there is something they have been doing for years, and risking $500 worth of coins (what 500 coins was worth not that long ago) did not seem like a big deal.

Right, but we are near the point where mBTC would make sense. And this is why many people argue for mBTC (0.001 bitcoins = 1 mBTC).
The reason many argue for uBTC (or "bits") instead though, is that we don't want to have to switch from mBTC to uBTC again later when another "stock split" will be required.
Even if you think mBTC is the right choice (or some different division), it still defeats your "kid with a sandwich" argument, because clearly there is precedent for dividing the unit for psychological reasons.

You can tell someone one of your addresses. If they know who you are, then they can see where bitcoins at *that address* go to. If they don't know who you are, then your identity is still protected.
Either way you can have other addresses of course, which they may or may not be able to connect to you, depending on what you do with your coins.

Coinbase offers instant purchases of up to 10 BTC/week to americans.
Instant is a lot faster than 1 day.


In other words, even if you go past your 10 BTC/week instant limit, you can lock in a price for when your bitcoins do arrive. So whether you consider this faster than bitstamp is a matter of whether you need the coins immediately, or need the price locked in immediately. Coinbase is faster in one case, bitstamp is faster in the other. In both cases coinbase is faster when you are under your 10 BTC/week instant limit.
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:23:45
Actually that is irrelevant. If you need the price of a bitcoin to increase for mining to become profitable, then you are making the wrong choice by buying mining hardware -- you should be buying bitcoins instead.
The implication here is that if the price of a bitcoin does not rise then buying mining equipment loses you money. If you bought coins instead in this case, you lose nothing (and gain nothing).
If the price of a bitcoin rises, then if you bought coins you see a positive profit. If you bought mining equipment, then you may see a profit also, but a smaller one.
So it makes absolutely no difference whether you bought the equipment with coins or fiat or gold or goats. If you require the price of a bitcoin to rise for mining to be profitable, then you should have just bought coins, to see a higher profit when the price of a coin rises.
Also, just because you bought with coins doesn't mean that in your mind you bought an item with coins. What if you wanted to sell coins, so you bought something instead? Then in your mind you are paying with fiat.

For cars in particular, using a colored coin as proof of ownership would work well if dealerships, law enforcement, and others all understood that colored coins are used to represent car ownership.

For some merchants chargebacks are a huge problem, and many merchants don't exist (can't do business) because they need a non-reversible payment method. Trying selling anything non-reversible for credit cards.
Most credit card processors won't even do business with you if you have a business that sells something like for example World of Warcraft gold, gift cards, gold/silver, because of chargeback issues.
When I sold Diablo 3 gold, I had a ~20% chargeback rate via paypal. My prices in bitcoin were about 25% lower than paypal as a result, and paypal payments had a graduated volume system, where bitcoin did not (buy as much as you want with bitcoin, buy $20 max first purchase with paypal, increasing maximum each purchase).

Most customers buy hammers to hammer nails and such, so you are not implicated in murder because you had no reason to think the customer was going to commit a murder.
If most people are buying reputation to scam others, then you are implicated because you had good reason to be suspicious of their scamming.
If you sell a hammer and you know the customer is going to murder with it, then you are in fact implicated in the murder.
If you have good reason to think that the buyer of your rep is going to do something positive with it (i.e. not scam people) then you are not a scammer.

You will still get your 1GH/s worth of coins on average, but you will experience more variance in your payouts compared with a pool that uses shares.
That is, you will get paid in larger amounts than a pool with shares, but less often, and more randomly. And of course, on average you expect to get paid 1% more than with a pool that has a 1% higher fee than this one.
If that still isn't clear, it's kind of like if your boss said to you, hey, I'll give you a 1% raise but instead of giving you a guaranteed paycheck every 2 weeks, I'll flip a coin and give you double your paycheck + 2% if it's heads, or zero if it's tails. On average you get 1% more than you got before, but you get paid more randomly (could have several weeks in a row of 202% pay, could have several weeks in a row of 0% pay).

If marketing departments were forced to follow rigorous scientific rules, they would not get much done. You seem to need proof, which is possible to give you (let's do/find a study on people's perception of digits to the right of the decimal) but I don't have one, nor do I think I need one to make the case here.
You presumably also don't have a link to a scientific study showing that numbers like 0.00000123 are worse than 12300 for the vast majority of people. Everyone who wants to switch to satoshis or mBTC or UBTC is assuming that this is the case. It almost certainly is the case.
Tell me which of the following you do not accept or do not understand:
1. Converting between mB and uB is easier than converting between mB and satoshi.
2. Converting between mB and BTC is easier than converting between satoshi and BTC.
3. Converting between uB and BTC is easier than converting between satoshi and BTC.
4. Multiple websites are using mB.
5. Most websites are using BTC.
6. You haven't defined precisely what happens when we want to divide beyond a satoshi. (e.g.: How many decimal places do we move?) And I have clearly defined what happens beyond the uB.
7. It seems likely that people are comfortable with numbers with 1 digit after the decimal (even without a rigorous scientific study to back this up). E.g.: people are comfortable with both 1.2 and 120.
8. It seems likely that people are not comfortable with numbers with many digits after the decimal. E.g.: 0.00012 is much less comfortable than 120.
9. uB is a simpler notation than "satoshi" and uB ("you-bee") is one fewer syllable to say than "sa-to-shi".

You surely could do that, but it is not as user friendly for the average person as trying to stick with one unit as often as possible.
Many people in this subreddit, especially the ones that discuss this issue, forget (or don't understand in the first place) that most people are not comfortable with what you're suggesting.
- If it's 0.0023 BTC then we didn't need to ever think of it as 0.0023 BTC in the first place. It was always 23000 uB.
- If something was 25000 BTC then the point is moot because I'm not addressing users that have $20 million+. In this case I agree though, you could just say 25k BTC.
- If something was 0.000002 BTC then it was always 2 uB.
Why on earth do we want to try to impose a system on people that makes them convert between μBTC and mBTC for units that can be expressed as 2 uB and 23000 uB?
On another note, why would we ever write μBTC? It's long, and needs a charmap or alt code entry to use. Use uBTC at worst.

In the US, this has become incredibly easy via Coinbase. Other services will pop up in the US and in other countries (including more decentralized options) as bitcoin continues to grow.


It's actually a very simple system, relatively speaking. Understanding how many are created and when is exceedingly simple: 25 created every 10 minutes, decreasing at clearly defined milestones. Compare that to the FED's rules for creating US dollars. Compare the bitcoin software to the numerous software systems involved in managing and transferring US dollars. Bitcoin is very simple compared to existing systems.


With bitcoin, it is possible to control your own money completely -- which is only possible with US dollars (or other fiat) if you use cash (and even then your ability to transport it is limited), at which point you have the exact same problem that you describe with bitcoin.  The important difference though, is that bitcoin allows for services to be built on top of it that allow for accountability, protection and optional reversibility (via escrow or paypal-like systems that transfer bitcoins from consumer to merchant). In this sense bitcoin is much more robust than existing systems, as we will ultimately be able to choose (both as consumers and merchants) what amount of protection, oversight, reversibility that we want.

If some company didn't charge users sales tax then they probably did it by accident (therefore illegally), or promotionally rolled the tax into the customers bill.

- No one would know you're a whale if you sit on your coins.
- Raising the price from $0.10 to $1.00 a few months faster than the price originally moved is an excellent bet, even if there is a risk of changing the price trajectory to downwards (some crazy how).
- You have not provided any compelling reason (or any reason?) that the price would have stopped rising if you helped it rise slightly faster.
- Buying early is exactly what many did. You would just displace one of those people a little. E.g. you could buy before the Winklevii.

If a transaction has a fee of 0.0001 or higher (or in the future, whatever the core client default fee is) and you wait 2 minutes and see no "double spend attempt detected" on the blockchain.info page showing you the address then the chance of the transaction being reversed is incredibly tiny (I don't think we have any evidence of this ever happening, excluding some very unusual circumstances that affected many transactions on the entire network once upon a time).

TLDR of your comment: " I think bitcoin will be replaced by an altcoin of some type because tx fees are too high. "
There are various ways in which bitcoin can be modified to reduce transaction fees. The bitcoin protocol is not 100% set in stone yet. Even if it is, there is still the possibility of sidechains to be used for high transaction volume instead. It's not likely that bitcoin is going to die when this problem is solved, instead it will grow, whether a sidechain implements the solution (even if an altchain does it first) or whether bitcoin itself implements a high transaction volume solution of its own.

Division by 1000 is standard for SI prefixes, so in this sense it is not arbitrary.
(e.g. 1 millimeter is 1/1000th of a meter, 1 micrometer is 1000/th of a millimeter).
As for psychological reasons, it would be better to make the unit use some space on the right of the decimal (to reduce how large the number is when we are ignoring the right side of the decimal), but not too much, because most humans do not deal with many digits after the decimal well (the problem we are trying to solve in the first place).
People are used to using 2 digits after the decimal, and this seems to work well.
So uB would allow you to use 2 digits after the decimal. I don't care about conforming to some arbitrary rules of some other currency, but I do care about making this as easy to use for everyone as possible. That includes meshing with scientific people that are used to SI, and meshing with people who are used to units like 0.01 for currency, but also for all other people who get uncomfortable when you start using 0.001 or 0.0001.
Some sites are already using mBTC. mBTC and uBTC work much better together than mBTC and satoshis. Instead of fighting against everyone using BTC and mBTC by using satoshis, why not use uBTC and get the same benefits of satoshis without causing problems for people using BTC and mBTC?
There's also the issue of what happens if we want to subdivide beyond a satoshi.
You can also see from the code ([which was shown to you once here]( that satoshi intended for the satoshi to be a cent unit, in case you care what Satoshi thinks. (That is, 0.01 uB = 1 satoshi, similar to dollars and cents.)

A sidechain could have 1000 times the transaction volume as bitcoin has, and charge 1/10th per transaction compared to bitcoin, and therefore generate 100 times the transaction fees *per unit time* that bitcoin does across the entire network, but you are paying 10% as much as a bitcoin transaction *per transaction*.


I don't think you understand what a side chain is.
Just because one particular feature is the same as bitcoin doesn't make the whole chain a "parallel chain".
You could even charge more per transaction but offer better privacy (think darkcoin, but implemented as a sidechain) and users might be willing to pay for that. Right now the lowest fee shared send that blockchain.info offers costs about 20x as much as the default fee in most clients, and users still pay that because they are willing to pay that much for privacy. If you offer a sidechain that does this at only 5x the default bitcoin transaction fee, then those users would use that chain since it actually saves them money compared to shared send transactions.

Bitcoin defines a function f(x). Think of f as a black box that takes in a number "x" and outputs a number "y".
To mine a block you must answer the question: "what x makes f(x) &lt; y?"
Finding that x requires trying many x's until you find one that makes f(x) &lt; y, and this is the process of mining.

Most wallets show you that you have your funds after 0 confirms. Mycelium is one of the few wallets that makes you wait for 1 confirm before it says the funds are yours or allows you to spend.
So what are you talking about? Are you actually referring to a weakness in mycelium like their dependence on device sandboxing instead of manually encrypting their keys locally? Sorry I'm trying to understand where you're coming from but this part of your comment seems tangential to what I was talking about.


Yes, and every time we've had an orphan, the 1 confirmed transaction has made it into the main chain. As I said in my comment, show me a counterexample.


Replace by fee certainly applies to 0 conf. Again, show me an example of a replace by fee attack invalidating a 1 confirmed transaction.

You asked for an example of transaction reversal, I showed you one. There are other examples as well. It's possible to have a transaction reversed without intending it.

There is a fundamentally different level of security between BitWallet and Blockchain.info.
Blockchain.info gives you an encrypted copy of all of your keys. As long as they don't change their site stealthily right before you log in then they don't even have access to your coins. While that is not totally secure, at least others that monitor for changes will alert reddit and you can avoid losing your coins. Compare this to BitWallet.
If the blockchain.info site goes down, as long as you have your encrypted backup, you still have access to all your coins via a 3rd party wallet that you can import your keys into.
Is BitWallet a closed source app? I would be weary of promoting that.

A $5 fee at this ATM would be a 0.25% fee on a $2000 withdrawal. That is a dramatic reduction, so I guess you've proven my point.
Besides, ATMs that charge a $5 fee have a monopoly on something (like location) so they can charge this fee. Most traditional ATMs do not charge a fee this high.

If you only use electrums seed (the 12 words electrum generates for you) then you always have access to all of your private keys by simply knowing your 12 word seed.
If you import a different private key (like one from a paper wallet) then electrum has to store that in a file for you, because it isn't one of the keys generated from your seed. Now you need that file *and* the 12 word seed to access your coins, instead of only needing the 12 word seed.

Spending 0 confirm transactions can sometimes be an issue. (Yes there are 2014 examples of this.)
This is why Mycelium wallet for example doesn't let you spend until you have 1 confirm.

1 BTC per day instead of 10 BTC per week.
In other words, you can buy 7 BTC per week now, instead of 10.


You can sell instantly on coinbase (50 BTC per week), you just don't receive the funds in your bank account for a few days in that case.


Buying and selling is part of Coinbase's business model. Most Coinbase customers are not merchants -- how could 600000 customers be merchants.

Yes, but miners still take the earliest broadcast transaction presumably because they don't want to fuck up the network they profit from by allowing 0 confirm attacks. You can prove this to yourself using peter todd's replace-by-fee attack tools (try to do the attack you just mentioned with 2 minutes between transaction broadcasts).
Of course this isn't a guarantee -- miners do what they want -- but so far (especially on $50 transactions) this doesn't happen, or it happens so rarely as to not be a concern.

Let's remind you of your original argument:


@_date: 2014-01-07 08:48:13
My argument comes straight out of any first year economics textbook.
I think your misunderstanding comes from what monopoly means.
Many firms have a monopoly on something.
For example:
- Coca-cola has a monopoly on the coca-cola image ("the other drink is not Coke, drink our drink, it is the only one that is Coca-Cola").
- Every localbitcoins seller that sells for cash may have a monopoly on the location that they can easily sell at -- other sellers have higher costs to sell at that same location.


These are all part of the cost of producing the product. As I said, if price is above cost, then it's monopoly price, otherwise not. Paying for those things is just paying for cost, so does not imply monopoly pricing.


I won't continue the discussion if you feel that sort of thing is necessary.

On a less related note, it's a little disheartening to have been a major presence in this subreddit from the beginning, and now no one here knows who I am. Bitcointalk has that going for it, as at least you can get some idea of a user's contributions (and you may recognize their avatar). Now that has become 100x larger, no one even knows who I am, and sometimes I get downvoted into the negatives for presenting for the 100th time a basic fact that newbies don't get yet, that I've had many upvotes for in the past with people who have come to understand it.
In this way, reddit becomes an echochamber of not just bitcoin users, but particularly *new* bitcoin users that are excited about the technology -- and terrified of addressing any shortcomings. Those of us who have spent years involved, thinking about the problems, don't really have a voice here. In fact we get shut out. A lot of old time reddit users seem to have just left now.

No, by themselves they don't. Would you want to sell to a customer that you now have to trust not to lose their key? 
If the customer loses their key, both your funds and the customer funds are locked up. The customer feels bad and you just lost not only the value of the item but also the value of the coins that you put into the multisig address to get the customer to trust you. 
If these losses happen 1/200 times, you are now paying 1% in multisig "fees" if you are matching customer purchase amount in the multisig address. 
It also costs you capital to lock funds up in multisig addresses, which has an associated cost.

1 confirm is plenty.
0 confirm is fine for new clients as long as they attach a high enough fee.
Your system less than triples the cost of double spending anyway, which may make it still worth it to do, so it is better to understand when a 0 confirm can be accepted.

Of course transaction fees can be higher. They can be anything you want them to be.
The demurrage I referred to would pay miners for example by taking coins from all other coin holders when a block is found on the sidechain. This might be a great or terrible idea, but it is an example of a possible way to incentivize mining a sidechain.
If you want more information it is available to you on bitcointalk, the blockstream site, etc.
I suggest reading the side chain whitepaper available from blockstream.com.
Feel free to wait for sidechains to be implemented, to me they are "future-viable" since it is highly likely that blockstream will produce this tech in the near future, and that's all I thought you meant by that phrase.

My time estimate *already* included completely insane exponential growth to avoid having this argument with you.
At 2% growth per year, it would take ~698 years before we need to switch the unit from uB to something smaller.
So I think ~20 years is pretty damn conservative. For 20 years, you would need the price of a bitcoin to double every year for 20 years in a row. That wouldn't happen even if bitcoin *completely* replaced gold.
This thread is about addressing the problem that it is inconvenient to price a coffee at 0.00000987 bitcoins, not that people may not want to spend coins in the first place due to deflation.

To be clear, no one has ever seen anyone hit by it.


Obviously. But for personal use, the miner has a single attempt to do this attack (as opposed to an exchange open to millions of transactions).
You can look at the network after 1 confirm and wait a few seconds and see if there is a competing block or not (if there is a fork).
If not, then a replace by fee attack is virtually impossible in this case.
A miner can do a block withholding attack and mine 2 blocks, but this miner loses these 2 blocks (~$18k) if the attack fails, and has a very low chance to succeed with the attack, so it is very much a losing proposition for this miner.
Therefore it is possible to use 1 confirm securely for $100k.


I don't think I showed this.
The network monitor is not even used in normal mycelium operation! Have you used Mycelium? It is only used during in person trades with local traders (that have reputation). This has nothing to do with our discussion of 1 conf transactions. Besides I don't think person to person local trading should be inhibited by 0 conf paranoia.

It's also based on your luck in finding a solution to the P2Pool block/share thingie in the P2Pool share chain.

Why presume no double spend? A competing transaction made by the person who sent the 0 conf coins is how it can become invalid. (This is not actually "double spend", but it colloquially called this, and is what you were referring to.)
It can happen by accident too, depending on the wallet the user that sent coins to you is using.


For personal use 1 confirmation is enough.
For exchanges, the common 3 confirmation is important since they are exposed to millions of transactions in relatively short time frames. 4 is overkill, which is why exchanges generally no longer require that many.

It is common for anyone who is familiar with formal math to make statements like this. He doesn't have a *proof* that it is impossible, but it is likely that it really is impossible and it is true that they don't exist because no one has ever made one.
So I would certainly expect (and/or hope) that many in the bitcoin community would make statements like that.
Furthermore, his article is more about the fact that *even if we could* make an ASIC-proof mining algorithm -- it isn't actually desirable.
TLDR: You're confusing a mathematical formality with a lack of imagination or drive to do something difficult. He's actually doing the opposite of what you think: he's being open to the idea that it is possible, even though it probably isn't.

If you find a reputable trader localbitcoins can be quite safe and in some cases very low cost and private.
Obviously the availability of traders that can offer a safe and low cost experience varies from one region to another, but you shouldn't cast aside peer-to-peer trading like localbitcoins in all areas just because you haven't had a safe and/or low cost experience in your area :)
In Toronto for example, Bitquick.co is very expensive compared to localbitcoins (appears to cost about 6% more), and there are multiple reputable/safe traders in Toronto on localbitcoins.

Then you didn't follow the logic. Clearly uB allows us to use 2 digits smaller numbers until a bitcoin is worth about $100000. Satoshis require us to express prices as larger numbers, and if we then want to subdivide a satoshi, the subdivision is less natural. uB (and the following nB) simply uses the SI convention of dividing by 1000 at each unit change.
There's nothing subjective here.

ASICMINER Cubes are 30x more expensive per GH/s than Cointerra's offering, as one example, so when (and if) Cointerra starts shipping, ASICMINER will have to reduce the price of their devices (and they can and will, as they have demonstrated many times already). ASICMINER has been reducing the price of their block erupters dramatically as competing products have been hitting the market. They have been reducing their prices because of competition -- not because their manufacturing costs have been dramatically declining.

It's not about that. I don't care about the standards, I care about making bitcoin as easy to use for everyone (all humans, globally) as possible.
Making use of digits on the right of the decimal point means using a smaller much of the time. (E.g.: "10000 uB" instead of "1000000 satoshi".)
Using too many digits to the right of the decimal is difficult for most humans though (which is the problem switching units is trying to solve in the first place), and 2 digits is just right.
So using satoshis as "cents" actually solves a real problem. It has nothing to do with conforming to what some other standard does.

I meant that Apple can't keep up with demand sometimes. That has been a problem for Apple in the past. Of course they try to make as much money as possible, I didn't say otherwise. 
Invitation systems are pretty common in the software world, e.g. Gmail did this, Google+ did this. It's just a way to manage demand for your product without losing demand due to not being able to fulfill orders (which produces a worse customer experience than needing to get an invite). Invites can also build demand through a feeling of exclusivity. 
They know that their manufacturing facility can only produce phones so fast, and increasing production speed means getting another facility, which costs a LOT of money, so is a big risk. 
Its also possible that if you know that you're not going to keep up with demand in the early days anyway, it's better to get your product into the hands of people that really want it, so that word of mouth reviews are better and this way you may build future demand. 
Many companies deal with this problem. There is no way to know for certain how much you should invest into manufacturing speed because it's not really possible to know exactly what demand for your product will be. It's also lower cost to produce product over time at one facility than to produce product 3x as fast and then stop 3x earlier.

The wiki link has citations for the quote I gave, just visit the link. You can also google around to confirm these percentages, lots of collections agencies sites give general descriptions of fees.
The fee to issue a payment via credit card is much much lower than a collection fee, isn't this obvious? Do we really need to have this argument?
Even if this argument is wrong somehow, do you think that users are going to equally continuously pay a fee to the gym in the case where they have to manually approve the fee vs. automatically get charged? I think it's obviously not equal here, but we can debate it if you really think your argument still applies.

The OPs joke would be a lot funnier to me if there weren't so many people in this thread that seemed to ***actually believe*** that the value of the dollar falling is what really happened here.
And to pre-empt the "omg but you *can* say the dollar value fell!" people (since I know they are coming, since I've seen this thread many times over the past 4 years):
No. The dollar value did not fall. We can tell, because we can measure it against a basket of other stuff. Like laundry detergent, cars, cheese, other currencies...

I agree with you and my upvotes go with you. But:
If you wrote your hypothetical for reddit karma, would people also think you were weird and so on? If so, does your hypothetical still fully apply?
However I think that they wouldn't think you're weird, because karma is purely a status symbol and/or achievement you work toward. It's not weird because it's not worth real money.
If reddit showed "number of bits received via reddit" then perhaps bitcoin tips would have the karma effect and small amounts would be appreciated. The trick is that the bot is very messy for this (onlookers don't want to see a bunch of 10 cent tips -- imagine if karma was given out this way instead of via an upvote button), but reddit's upcoming crypto colored coins being *integrated* into the site could change all that.
Still, I agree with your etiquette suggestion for ChangeTip in it's current form.

He suggested communicating two things:
- stock data
- bitcoin
Bitcoin was just one of the picks he was suggesting he'd include.
Bitcoin has seen a 10000x value increase in 5 years. So it's a pretty good pick. You'd have to do an awful lot of work and communicate a lot of data about the market to get a comparable return.
I think it's also fair to assume we have a trade capital of less than $100k (since 99% of reddit will be in that situation).
More importantly, defend why this is "delusion". Is it delusion to think that bitcoin is a good pick, or what else is delusional about his comment? His comment would very likely result in a near 10000 fold increase in his investment if he sent back a bitcoin historical price chart.

That's not the observation the quote in the OP is making though.
He's saying that bitcoin is being held to a standard that fiat can't meet, for example.

"it does math" to create a script contract for all users.
All users then sign this contract and it is published to the blockchain via miners that verify all signatures.
If everyone doesn't sign it, then it doesn't get accepted by miners, and therefore your coins don't move. If everyone signs it, then all coins go where the contract says they will. The contract can be constructed in such a way that you know where your coins will go and you know about 18 other users sending and receiving, but you don't know who of the other 9 senders is sending to which 9 receivers.
TLDR: You are assured in the same way that you are assured that your coins go where you want when you send a coin directly to someone normally, or when you do a 3 of 2 transaction, etc.

If you're talking about reversal risk then the CC company risks nothing: if the 1 million gets reversed the credit card company doesn't pay, they simply reverse the money away from the merchant.
If you're only talking about the risk of debt here, then if the credit card company gets to "risk" 1 million in debt, then they are happy! They approved this person for 1 million in credit card debt which they then charge an insane interest on.
The transaction fee has nothing to do with the cost of the debt. If anything there might be a higher cost of reversal in cases where they have to investigate fraud on larger amounts -- but it still doesn't scale linearly (as their fees do).

Bitcoin needs a positive image and your history detracts from your message.
No one is going to trust Mark Karpeles after MtGox. Thats not because of someone's personal bias or because he didn't get an equal chance, its because his reputation is tainted.

Isn't a $1500 minimum inline with the $2k number I stated in the comment that started this discussion? 
I have a PC Financial and Tangerine bank account. They are useless. For me it is not acceptable to wait days to get my money when I could get it in minutes with a big bank account. 
If you are dealing with small amounts, don't run a business, and don't need to move money internationally, and don't have enough money to justify an investment account for your "checking"  money then perhaps it's great.
1% interest is actually very bad compared to a big bank since you can store all your money in an investment account and have it out next business day with a big bank if you need it. So really you are comparing 1% interest to the several percent (3% to 9% depending on your risk tolerance) with a big bank.

Yes, almost 2 months delay. BFL was a ~16 month delay.
"Avoid cointerra" is bad advice because it sounds like "buy mining equipment, just not from cointerra!" but really Cointerra is about par for the course in the mining equipment game.
I'd be more amenable to hearing "don't buy mining equipment".
Your bet on Cointerra equipment didn't pay off in the way you expected, but in my opinion they have been one of the better ASIC companies so far, despite the small delay and Terraminer II change. They offered Terraminer IV upgrades at a discount to Terraminer II customers (and ship next day, which is what I chose to do), or a free upgrade to Terraminer IV if you want to wait ~1 month.
Frankly, I expected the delays to be much worse -- when has an ASIC company ever *not* had delays? This is a risk that you should be informed about before preordering mining equipment in the first place.

Car insurance companies can get a reasonably accurate idea of what the risk of insuring you is, and can price your insurance policy accordingly. Even when they get the risk totally wrong, the maximum loss to one driver is very small compared to the size of the insurance company, and is an isolated loss, so there is no systemic risk.
For banks, they can invest in AAA rated debt that is really junk toxic crap debt because the entities that give the ratings are incentivized to give inaccurate ratings.
More importantly, when lenders default on this debt, massive leverage via derivatives can cause the damage to be catastrophic. [The largest insurance company in the world]( almost went bankrupt this way in 2008 and would have, if not for an unprecedented in size government bailout.
You might as well compare paying $2 to insure your $200 FedExed package to insuring the entire city of New York during a nuclear war between USA and some other super power. These are both insurance, but are wildly different.

The price of the USD (or other currency) vs. a basket of other things is very publicly available and not even really possible to be controlled by the government anyway.

No it really isn't. Anyone who has run a bitcoin related business and dealt with the banks knows the answer, and I'll share it with you now.
Banks manage risk. If you open a "bitcoin business" and have few credentials to run a money services type business then the bank is going to view you as high risk. This actually has nothing to do with bitcoin, and the bank would treat you the same way if you said you were opening some different type of money services business.

It's a great quote and an interesting thought experiment. But:
That quote only really shows that 256 bit keys are really big. It doesn't prove that there's no clever way to factor a 256 bit key or otherwise weaken SHA256 (or other encryption/hashing methods) or find that there's an implementation problem with the encryption we use.
That quote also assumes computation that is not done in the quantum way, and in fact quantum computers would break 256 bit keys for some types of encryption (including ECDSA, which bitcoin uses).

Not really, because:
a) They don't know how to answer that question.
b) You are discouraging them from listening by making it seem like you could drone on about this for hours, you're disconnecting you from them by putting yourself in a "I'm the expert and you are the noob" type of position.
c) They will be scared to say "everything" or "a lot" because they don't want to commit to listening for hours since they don't even know if they are interested yet (because they don't know what the info you're about to give them even is).
d) If they do say "tell me everything!" then they'll feel trapped when they want you to stop, because they know they just gave you permission to give lots of info.
This list goes on for quite some time actually.
I suggest that you just give them a simple explanation first, then ask if they want to know a little more, and use your judgement to see if they really do want to hear a bunch more.

I'm not patronizing you, I'm simply letting you know that I am mostly just regurgitating information from first year economics, which I took.

I understand that sensing (and conveying) tone over the internet is difficult, so I'm not sure how to convey that I'm trying to be friendly about this other than to just say it. I'm trying to be friendly. No need to be offended.


Correct, they do have a monopoly on that road. This is why some McDonalds have different sales figures from another McDonalds. It's also one of the reasons why convenience stores get away with charging higher prices for the same product than your grocery store.


The company pays employees. These wages are part of the cost of producing the product. The operator of the company is one of the company employees.

I don't think anyone in this thread suggested changing the protocol for tax reasons. The problem is that many users need to be able to keep track of the price in fiat at every transaction for tax reasons.
This is not like cash, it is not even like cash in a different currency. The IRS is not treating bitcoin as a foreign currency.
If you don't have a client that has the tax info built it then this will slow adoption of businesses as they will have to build their own system just to be able to send and receive coins.

I think there isn't one, AKA it's the same as the block limit (1000kb). A 500kb transaction costs around 5 BTC in fees by default though IIRC, due to the way fees scale, so it could be very expensive to make large transactions that actually get mined.
So one of those transactions per 10 minutes.

It's an interesting concept but I don't see it as being practical.
If you want a bitcoin accepting vending machine then build a bitcoin accepting vending machine.
It isn't easier to build one if you build 50 separate locks that all have to connect to wifi/4g individually and then place them all in your vending machine.
It's easier to just build a machine with one wifi/4g controller, controlling all locks.
In fact it's a lot easier to just modify an already existing vending machine.
So while this is a cool idea, I'm not seeing how having just a lock by itself would be used.
Besides, vending machines don't really even use "locks".

The number of satoshis in 1 bitcoin and the number of total bitcoins are indeed arbitrary.
So? They are the arbitrary numbers that we chose and the ones we continue to use.
You are trying to make the case for switching to a different arbitrary system, instead of working with the already agreed upon arbitrary numbers. To me that is obviously worse than using SI notation with a bitcoin.
I have been giving you reasons why using a satoshi as the default unit is worse than using uB as the default unit, not telling you why it is scientifically necessary to use SI notation or something. It's just easier this way.
You want to take 1 bitcoin, and divide it by 100 million, and then divide it by some other amount later, or change what a satoshi *means* if we need to subdivide further.
I want to take 1 bitcoin, and divide it by 1000 once or twice, every time we need to make it smaller -- using the notations that have existed since the 1700s. It extends forever cleanly, and is compatible with already widely used notations, both in the bitcoin community and elsewhere.


Well that would be horrible. Imagine if we decided to multiply the number of bitcoins you have by 10. I hope it's obvious why this is a problem but I can start listing the reasons if you like. The main one is that it is extremely confusing to change what the unit of currency means. "Hello sir, your coffee will be 99 satoshis", "the old satoshis or the new satoshis?"

I absolutely agree, and I think it is ridiculous to view it as an exchange sale.
It was 's suggestion that it would be an "on-exchange sale", not mine, and what I was disagreeing with in the first place, so I'm not sure why you're taking us in circles here :)
Off exchange the auction might sell above market, or it might not -- it all depends on whether there is some bidder that wants to speculate on 30k coins.
If yes, they may sell above market (due to the advantage to that bidder of not pushing exchange prices up with a large purchase).
If not, they will almost certainly sell below market (because the only incentive to buy is to get them at a discount).

The possibilities are staggering, but currently M of N useful and already used. M of N gets used for things like bounties, where you want to have multiple people controlling the bounty address, so that it takes more than one person's consent to send the coins away. This prevents the manager of the bounty funds from just running away with your coins.
It's also useful as escrow with a 3rd party (M of N addresses) or "do-it-yourself escrow".
In do-it-yourself escrow, you want to send coins to Bob. Bob is going to ship you an item. You send coins to an address that you can prove you no longer have access to without also getting a key from Bob. Bob can't spend from the address without also getting a key from you. Basically those coins are locked up at the address now until either Bob gets a key from you (now he can spend the coins) or you get a key from Bob (now you can spend the coins).
The idea is for example:
You send 1.5 bitcoins to the escrow address, and then he sends 0.5 coins to the address also.
There are now 2.0 coins at the address that neither of you can spend without help from the other person.
Now Bob sends you your package.
If you receive the package then you release the coins to bob and he gets 2.0 bitcoins (his original 0.5 coins plus your 1.5 coins for his package).
If he doesn't send you your package, you don't release the coins from the address for him (but you can't spend them either). So now you lose your coins but Bob also loses 0.5 coins (though we could have chosen any amount here) and Bob gains nothing. Bob and you could also potentially arrange to give both coins back to their owners.
The idea is that fraud would be greatly discouraged because it would require the sender to put some of his own coins at risk in order to make the promise of delivery to you. Imagine how this would change how current mining companies behave.
This idea isn't perfect, but it's just one example of the possibilities.
For a 3rd party escrow concept (this is already used by some), read this description:

There are multiple ways to incentivize side chain mining. Transaction fees are one way (this is the same way that bitcoin mining ultimately is incentivized).
Another way is demurrage -- distribute a tiny portion of all sidechain coins to the miners.
Another way is to create a 3rd pegged asset used to pay sidechain miners.


That day has come and gone. [Blockstream foundation has received $21 million in funding already.](

Just want to point out some things:
a) Forcing users to use one address is bad for privacy.
b) Sending to a users address on your contact list is dangerous because you don't know for sure that they still have access to that address. Have none of your friends ever changed email addresses, and you sent to the old one instead of the new? No big deal for email, when it's an irreversible bitcoin transfer though...
So a contact list could work, but it has to be a lot smarter than how contact lists for email addresses currently work, and that probably means developing a protocol for how those contact lists work, and giving users the ability to change the bitcoin address that others have their name pointing to.

By selling the contract now you secure the value of the mining in the future, and get the capital now to build more machines.
If you sell on an exchange over time, then if the price of a coin falls you lose money, if difficulty rises more than expected you lose money, and you have to wait longer before you can build more machines.
It is not the same thing.
I ran a mining contract operation where everyone profited including myself and my customers, years ago (the ferroh mining contract).
I agree that virtually all (if not 100%) cloud mining operations are scams, but it could make sense to sell a mining contract in the right circumstance.

$0.05 on a $10 transaction is 0.5%.


That is $14 million per year for [Chipotle]( and would represent a massive performance improvement, if they could save 2% per year. So that was a really weak argument :)
A better argument, and the real answer I think we just discovered, is that paying with bitcoin on a $10 transaction could ultimately be a 2% fee to the miners anyway, so the whole discussion is moot -- there is no savings to pass on to the consumer in this case.

1. I stopped being surprised by major price drops years ago. You can't really see just how large the price drops are in a typical bitcoin "all time" chart, but they are big, if you zoom in on those drops. It has happened over and over and over again. When problems are solved, bitcoin can grow. The price might rise without the problems being solved (as has happened many times) or maybe we need real solutions first at this point.
2. When they are addressed. I'm not your fortune teller and if you really want my best guess, in 1-2 years when sidechain tech is completed by Blockstream. What matters is that these problems *can* be addressed, they have been proven to be able to be addressed, there is a high demand for them to be addressed and therefore: they will almost certainly be addressed!
3. Altcoins have solved many issues during these 6 years. Sidechains allow those altcoin innovations to be applied to bitcoin. So, "soon" we'll see that development affect bitcoin. "Soon" is whenever sidechain tech is done. Perhaps 1 year, maybe longer. Blockstream just started on this, and they have $20 million in VC backing to get it done, as well as bitcoin core devs working on it.

They insure $100k of your deposit, and your deposit is now able to be used for risky investments after the [Glass-Steagal act]( was repealed in 1999.
If AIG, which insures the risky stuff fails to cover losses, then FDIC would have to cover your deposit. However the FDIC only covers a limited amount (I believe $100k, which can be very small if you have your retirement savings in the bank).
From [the link I gave you](


So if AIG had not been bailed out, then it would fall to the FDIC to cover the losses that AIG could not. FDIC wouldn't cover much of your retirement savings, and even for the people who were totally covered (people with a small amount in the bank), we don't know if FDIC could afford to cover everyone's losses. We're talking about potentially trillions in losses here in a 2008-like scenario.

I explicitly said twice the assumption ***if demand &gt; capacity*** (capacity = block size limit). When you have that assumption, block size dictates blockchain size.
You then take that assumption away, so of course what I said no longer applies here. That isn't me "failing to understand", that is you misunderstanding my argument.
Unlimited sized blocks do not currently exist, so of course currently you can't say that demand alone dictates block size.

Blockchain size is a multiple of block size, when demand exceeds capacity (which it does in both my example and yours).


In other words, if more people want in than can fit, then raising block size will raise blockchain size. If demand &gt; capacity (as we both agree it does) then block size exactly determines the blockchain size (as I said).
In your example freeway lanes are the block size, and they determine freeway capacity (blockchain size).

As you well know, there isn't a widely used implementation of lightning yet. Until there is, we can't calculate that network capacity with precision.
"Seconds" is a very possible answer here, at some point in the future, but since we're forced to guess, hours is a conservative estimate that I'm not likely to be on the wrong side of when lightning goes live, should anyone look back at my comment in the future. "Seconds" requires a lot more bandwidth than lightning nodes are willing to provide as you'll see in a moment.
The main bound on the lightning network capacity is probably just whatever bandwidth the lightning nodes are willing to use for relaying. Let's say that's 1MB/sec. Let's say a lightning transaction is 1KB avg.
So about 1000 transactions per second. 2 million transactions would then take ***33 minutes*** to complete.
1KB transaction size was a guess.
1MB/s lightning node bandwidth is a guess too.
These numbers are very likely within an order of magnitude of the actual numbers, so let's put an upper bound on this at say 340 minutes (1 decimal order of magnitude higher), or about ***6 hours***.
Future bandwidth increases means this number goes down.

100 years to 1%.
10000 years to 0.01%.
Math for 1 year of coins produced over 10000 previous years produced:
    (50*6*24*365)/(50*6*24*365*10000) = 0.0001 =&gt; 0.01%
Basically the system might take 50-1000 years before it would start really catching on maybe. It depends on how forward looking participants are and what an acceptable rate of money supply inflation is. Even after 50 years the 2% inflation rate might look better than alternatives, especially with the knowledge that it is ever decreasing. Still I agree that this is way too slow.
Then again, I was never arguing that we should fork to such a system, just that a never ending addition of coins could be fine. If block rewards decreased as they currently do but stopped at 1 BTC per block forever, I would have preferred that (if we could go back in time) because that would satisfy all the problems presented by those who argue for demurrage in bitcoin and so on, while leaving us at a very very tiny rate of money supply increase (if any, since coins are lost sometimes).

In the current way that bitcoin works those who aquire bitcoins the earliest are "punished by inflation the most" as well.
In the "50 BTC forever" system, bitcoin would have just taken longer to get to a low inflation level, at which point it would have taken off then (e.g. 15 years in, it has a 6% inflation rate, about half of the current bitcoin inflation rate).
Another way to view this is that there would be a longer period of time for bitcoin to gain "early adopters".
In any case you can't just unequivocally state that "it just doesn't work". It's very similar to the way bitcoin currently works.

Some other benefits of 50 BTC fixed reward:
- You would avoid the problem of lost coins over time forcing us to have to one day greatly increase the number of decimal places and we'd have the assurance that there would always be some coins.
- It would have reduced the "ponzi" like feel of logarithmic supply changes that gave coins possibly more rapidly than needed to early users.
- The change in the coin supply rate is gradual and continous, instead of having sudden shocks to the system and speculation about what happens at each halving. Instead the annual inflation rate is decreasing slightly at every single block.
That said, I'm still opposed to this change as changing the total number of coins sets a dangerous precendent. Also if you think the block size debate is bad, imagine what the block reward debate would look like!

Even after 50 years it would be 2% -- less than current fiat system inflation numbers in the USA.


No, I shouldn't. It's not much more valuable than bitcoin. To pursue an altcoin you need a MAJOR huge benefit over bitcoin. Not a tiny barely-distinguishable-from-bitcoin difference.
If bitcoin had chosen 50 BTC fixed reward from the beginning, it would still work.


Damn it man. It's the same system as bitcoin. Bitcoin would have worked exactly the same.
The value would plummet because why? Because it has inflation? Current bitcoin has inflation too.

It's nothing like that.
OP just wants to be able to adjust the fee he pays for his transaction after he broadcast the transaction. Bitcoin doesn't have a auction bidding process for this, and OP just wants to add that. Nothing sinister, it's better for the market.
Although OP maybe doesn't realize I guess that he can actually already do this by rebroadcasting the tx if he is the sender, or use child-pays-for-parent rules to increase the fee if he is the receiver.

Yes, the point is that there is no magic percentage.
At 49% you have the altcoin, at 51% you have this altcoin, at 99% you have this altcoin (or the other 1% original bitcoin can be viewed as the altcoin if you want, but there is no actual difference here).
It's all the same except for how many people use it.

If 10% (or any percent) of users decide to continue to use the "deprecated" chain, they can continue to use it forever (as long as there are also miners mining the "deprecated" chain).
I put deprecated in quotes because it is only actually deprecated from your point of view. There's nothing to stop some users from deciding they will continue to use that chain forever (and so they don't view it as deprecated).

You don't taint coins using analysis. You use analysis to reveal taint of coins.
Taint analysis of coinjoined coins doesn't allow them to say you are connected to some bad guy. At least not any more than they can say you are connected to some bad guy using Monero, if you sent to the payment processor using Monero.
"Oh, you sent to us using monero -- some bad guy uses monero so maybe you are the bad guy." It's the same thing. "Oh, you used a popular wallet that uses coinjoin by default to send your coins, maybe you are a bad guy."
You can't claim that monero gives you fungibility but coinjoin doesn't. If you believe that taint can make you guilty, then if you use monero you are guilty by association because some bad guys use monero.
The point is that if you use a wallet (that inevitably will exist) that implements coinjoin as a basic/mandatory send then you gain fungibility.


You probably think this way because you haven't seen a good implementation of coinjoin yet.
Coinjoin sends can complete in 1 second for small-group single-round coinjoins. I see no reason why you couldn't have a wallet with built in coinjoin as default send behavior.
You can have coinjoin sends that are ***indistinguishable*** from normal bitcoin sends (since bitcoin sends frequently have 2+ inputs and 2+ outputs. No one has done this yet, but it is very doable.

I don't think you are grasping that a fixed block reward is almost exactly the same in the long run as having no reward at all.
Both have 0% inflation in the long run. Both start with high inflation in the beginning.
A fixed reward bitcoin has an inflation rate that goes down slower than our current bitcoin. That's about the only difference in terms of the "finite bitcoin" you're talking about.
As for the benefits, [I mentioned some here]( They aren't big, because the difference between this system and the current bitcoin is not big.


Again, in a "50 BTC forever", the block reward is eventually effectively the same as 0 reward and fees aren't really compensated that way.

Long range alone doesn't even come close to solving your problem.
BTW, 4g drones dont exist yet despite some efforts, as it's a very hard problem due to latency (the drone basically needs to mostly fly itself meaning improved AI is needed for consumers).
Anyway, you know the government has drones too (much better ones) and helicopters as well, right?
One short helicopter flight ends OP's operation.
Anyway, what is the point you are trying to make? Is it that you can make this project happen with current tech? Because you definitely CAN'T. If you think you can, that's because you don't know much about current consumer level drone tech.
Drone tech could make this possible in the future, but it's pretty far from doing that at the moment. Maybe in 5-15 years when drones have better AI, lower costs (for high end models), longer range (fuel-wise), longer range (control-wise), travel MUCH faster (currently 60kmh lol good luck evading anything), etc, etc.

They are not trivial for example in the case we're discussing, where someone pays for something and then walks out of the store a few minutes later, and only then attempts the doublespend. Several minutes is a long time and you can get most or all of the miners to see that transaction as being clearly first.
Miners can then decide to include the first seen transaction. Currently this is what typically happens, without RBF rules.
With RBF, they would include the second (fradulent) transaction.

To be clear, the F2Pool members would have gotten fees from the other transactions that normally would have been selected for this block (the highest fee transactions).

When I say "miner's fees are known in advance about 99.9% of the time" I mean you can select a fee 999/1000 times that will work. The other times you will have underestimated the fee you'd need. Even in today's very uncertain fee market, it is easy to select a good enough fee most of the time that is very close to the minimum needed:

A 50 BTC block reward would work fine actually, but I think you've shown one reason why it wasn't chosen: people are bad at math and don't understand how an addition to the money supply at a fixed rate means inflation tends to 0% in the long run, and is virtually the same as having a fixed total supply in terms of the value of your coins.

If you modify the client to use different math then you aren't "unable to deal with math".
More importantly though, if you run the client in such a way that it doesn't follow bitcoin rules, then you aren't using bitcoin, and no one will accept your coins.

Your market is not needed as bitcoin already addresses this if you know how to do it.
If you are the sender:
Rebroadcast the tx with a higher fee.
If you are the receiver:
Broadcast a new tx that spends the unconfirmed tx to the same recipient address with a higher fee. Child-pays-for-parent mining pools will treat the transaction as having this new higher fee attached.
The only advantage I see in your system is that you don't have to waste space on an additional transaction with child pays for parent rules, if the receiver is the one increasing the fee.

Do you realize you are ignoring the most dangerous and unknown part of raising the block size?
A permanent chain fork is not something any bitcoin service has ever experienced.
When you fork, there are now two bitcoins. Call them bitcoin 0.10 and bitcoin 0.11.
The price of 0.10 coins and 0.11 coins are different. Exchanges are not set up to trade two different bitcoins yet.
All of your coins will be duplicated into two sets of coins, you will have coins on the 0.10 chain and on the 0.11 chain as well, both with have value (although the hope is that 0.10 coin values drop very *very* fast).
Basically 0.10 becomes the altcoin according to 0.11 supporters, and 0.11 becomes the altcoin according to 0.10 supporters.
Do you understand the dangerous precendent, and that if we do this, we really *really* don't want to keep doing it anymore after this?
I want to see fewer posts on from people who do not have a comprehensive understanding of what it actually means to fork the chain.
Whether we can handle 8mb blocks or whatever size is the least important and most trivial issue for me.

None of them. I mentioned elsewhere that there is no good coinjoin implementation yet. When I said that you "can have" normal looking coinjoin transactions, I mean that it is possible to create such an implementation. 


When you have 10 inputs and 15 outputs and those feed into 4 more rounds of 10+ input 10+ output transactions, as you do with joinmarket (with default settings) that is obviously coinjoin mixing to anyone observing the blockchain.
However it is possible to construct coinjoin transactions such that they are 2 inputs and 2 outputs and this can't be distinguished from any other bitcoin transaction.

10 years from now 100mb blocks would be a lot less bad.
You could also modify what I said to be 10mb blocks and $25 fee. Still better than wire transfers.
You could also modify what I said to be 1mb blocks (AKA no change whatsoever from today), $25 fee, and the government pays $2.3 billion/year to miners to force us to pay this fee.
At $2.3 billion/year paid to miners, those miners now have a lot of resources and incentive to build bitcoin tech and subsequently increase market cap, and therefore reduce this fee or raise the amount the government has to spend to maintain that fee.
The situation is very far from there being "no way".

Snapchat has perhaps 100x more users than bitcoin, at the moment. Snapchat is used for sending about 1 billion snaps per day.
When investors look at buying things, they factor in risk. Snapchat is already at these huge numbers in terms of use. Bitcoin is not.
Bitcoin already has a *much* higher market cap per user than snapchat (like an order of magnitude higher).
So for Bitcoin, there are a bunch of unknowns, which equal risk, which in part reduces what is paid for it.

***Or you can do a 1% attack with a little luck.***
If you do a 1% attack, you have roughly a 0.01% chance to succeed with this attack as all you have to do is find the next 2 blocks.
If you do a 10% attack, you can succeed at this attack with a 1% chance.
You only need 51% mining power to statistically expect to maintain the longest chain forever, which is not needed for this attack.
If you only have to reverse 1 confirmation, then you only need to find 2 blocks before anyone else, and since mining is random you can succeed at that with a small amount of hash power if you are lucky.

Rational miners mine altcoins -- those are not so different from a minority chain bitcoin.
If difficulty falls faster than fiat trade value on the minority chain then greedy miners (rational miners with a short term outlook on profitability) will mine it.
Altruistic miners or greedy miners with a long term view might dedicate some small amount of hashpower to the minority chain if they have a long term belief in 1MB blocks. Kind of how we have many "altruistic" bitcoin nodes out there.
I mostly agree with you though, it's just that I want to clarify for everyone what specifically happens during a fork. There's definitely a lot of misunderstanding in about that and it's not as cut and dry as "oh the minority chain is instantly dead at 87% majority!".

@_date: 2015-07-11 21:58:39
In the long run, 99% of the time (probably more like 99.99%) it is not even used.
When it is used, usually it is because the user's bitcoin client didn't send a high enough fee (bad bitcoin client or unusual bitcoin network conditions).
In that case, the receiver pays a higher fee either manually or the receiver's client does it automatically and it is invisible.
It results in a roughly doubled fee only when it is used, so even if it is used as much as 1% of the time, that means a 1% higher average miner's fee. That is a tiny increase compared to the huge benefit of being able to continue to use 0-conf as it currently is. Also, miner's fees are only increased in the case of the receiver using child-pays-for-parent to increase the fee. There are other ways to solve this, such as the client rebroadcasting the tx with a higher fee (the old tx will not enter chain).
This can be pretty much invisible to both sender and receiver in well designed clients, so I fail to see how the user experience would ever be worse than full RBF. In full RBF it is no less visible.
Further, the full RBF user experience of someone's funds getting 100% burned to miner's fees is a really bad experience (although from a game theoretic perspective probably rare). That also leads to higher miner fees, technically speaking.
@_date: 2015-07-11 23:43:08
In the long run the minimum miner's fee is known in advance about 99.9% of the time so dynamic fee clients (all clients in the future) don't need to ever bother with RBF.


Because I want my money. I have used FSS RBF many times during the recent network spam and recommended it to others that have their funds stuck. I have $5000 coming to me, it costs $0.15 to make sure I get it, or I can risk the transaction dropping or I can wait 24 hours for a single confirm.


Full RBF relies on the game theory argument that rational senders will not want their transaction burned as a miner fee, so they don't try to screw the receiver.
You can also use game theory to see that miners don't want to damage the network that they profit from. There are ZERO full RBF mining pools right now, and there are several FSS RBF pools.


This is the case with full RBF and FSS RBF. Either way you need to pay your miner fee.
If it is visible with full RBF then it is visible with FSS RBF and vice versa.
Anyway what I was saying was that the FSS RBF process can be made seamless.


The sender was a fraudster. The receiver has now been screwed by someone who tried to abuse 0-conf RBF, or who intentionally wanted the receiver to get burned after they got their coffee (or whatever) after paying with 0-conf and has no choice but to burn the funds.

The whole point of my comment was that this is not the case :)
At the moment the costs are high, but moving forward the efficiency of mining will increase greatly (even in the next few months, if ASICs are released). It's hard to know what the transaction costs will be in the future, but they will be bounded by what users pay in fees.
My estimate in the comment you are responding to for the electricity costs per transaction is 0.1% per transaction once the block reward is small, and ASICs are the norm.
Remember, ***currently bitcoin inflates by 12.4% per yea***r, which pays miners. In the future, bitcoin inflates by ***0%*** per year, so transaction fees will bound mining costs, and so people paying the transaction fees will determine how much mining costs. That will likely be a couple of percent (like the current traditional system), with a small fraction of that being electricity costs.

Note that mining does not use a single SHA256 though. The crypto processor would have to be general enough to be programmed to do SHA256(SHA256(x)), and would probably be general enough to do other types of hashes.
I highly doubt that a crypto coprocessor that is that general will be able to outperform an ASIC that is dedicated to mining, even if the mining ASIC is 65nm, and the general crypto processor is 22nm.
On the other hand, the crypto coprocessors could be extremely inexpensive ($10 per chip wouldn't be out of the question).

Well, historically gains were made a few years ago when only CPUs could be used to mine, and not many people were mining, so you could get a large piece of that 50 bitcoin pie every 10 minutes. Back then bitcoins were not worth much, so it was just a fun hobby.
Then people started taking bitcoin more seriously, buying coins and driving up the price.
Then GPU mining became available which was 10x faster.
People who mined at this time made a lot of money because there were still relatively few people mining, while the price of a bitcoin was going up and up. This was a couple of years ago.
People in the last year have likely made money if their electricity was free. If not, then it depends on how cheap their electricity is, and how cheaply they managed to put their mining operation together.
Today, with ASICs coming, people who get ASICs first will probably see a profit. After that, I can't really predict whether you will see a profit or not, or when you will see that profit.
Currently it looks like buying an ASIC will pay for itself after about 1 year if you pay $0.10/KWh for electricity.
If you are new to this, I think that I recommend that you wait until ASICs actually ship, so that there is no question that they work and can be delivered.
Then, if you are curious about bitcoin, do some research first, and buy one of the cheaper ASICs.
If your goal is to make a living off of this, give up. There are better ways to make a living than by trying to mine bitcoins more efficiently than everyone else.

Is that because I allowed people to vote for either one, or..? :) Don't worry, everyone using my service abstained from voting and so I voted for BIP0016 by default, which won.
Currently the satoshi client (bitcoind) supports M of N, but doesn't give the average person an easy way to use it, which brings me to:


No one has built a UI for this yet.
There isn't even really an easy way to do this with the bitcoind API/command-line.
You *can* use it if you are developing a service and can read and understand this:
And then use the raw transaction API.
So basically, for the average user, you can't use this yet because there is no interface for it.
Exchanges could theoretically start using it though.

Block generation is and has always been random. You can't predict when someone will find a block.
On average, they are generated every 10 minutes.
Some alt chains (like litecoin) generate blocks more often to mitigate this issue, but the tradeoff is that the blockchain gets larger (since there will be more blocks) and latency affects mining more.
Why precisely does the variance of block generation bother you? Mostly you dont need to wait for even 1 block in order to conduct business using bitcoins. (If you think about it, very few products/services require many block confirmation, and if they do, then the variance of block generation isnt a big deal because they will wait for ~6 blocks anyway.)

I like blockchain.info, and recommend it to new users.
However, it is only perhaps 99.999% secure, which is at least one reason why it is not recommended by bitcoin.org.
blockchain.info could steal funds from users if it really wanted to, by modifying their code to record user passwords.
It is also only 99.99% reliable (in terms of uptime and bugs), and it would be bad if users got the idea that a blockchain.info failure was a failure of bitcoin. (Also, imagine if blockchain.info suddenly disappeared one day -- most users would not lose funds but it would not be good.)
I'm all for making new users experience as good as possible, but I think we need to at least wait a while longer before we start recommending blockchain.info on bitcoin.org, or improve Multibit (a standalone SPV client) or something like that.

To answer your question:
Why would he crash the price when he could sell slowly and at a much higher price?
If he sells $600k of coins, the price crashes to $8, and then moves back up to $9. Why wouldn't he just slowly sell $1 million worth down to $9 instead? Or sell $1 million even slower, all at $10?
I personally hope that he uses a bot to sell during price spikes only -- this would give add some price stability in one direction at least.

It didn't verify the chain. In 0.7 it verifies the chain by default now. You can avoid this with the "-loadblock=block0001.dat -loadblock=blk002.dat" switches.


As I said, it was bottlenecked by the verification, so it wasn't downloading any faster than that.
So in either case it verifies the blockchain in 3 days on your machine.
3 days is pretty long though, it's rare to find a machine that can't do it in 24 hours or less. Are you doing this on a USB key or something odd like that? The typical bottleneck is your HDD.

Empirically, my phone is extremely fast, even though it is almost 2 years old (Galaxy S2).
Occasionally there are hangs, but they are pretty rare and it's an *app* hanging, not the entire OS, so it is trivial to pull up the task manager (by holding the home key) and kill the app in question.
I also develop using managed languages (on the desktop, not on phones) and Java about 10 years ago was *much* slower than it is today. Virtual machines have come a long way since then and I'd argue that it is already very fast.
C# is fast enough for games development on the desktop (and windows phone, which has a generational garbage collector now BTW), so it is fast enough for everything.


I personally think that there was a relatively small difference between Android 2.1 and 4.0 in terms of how you interact with your phone as the end user. I'm saying that if the change bothers you, you can simply ignore the change. Many people continue to use Android 2.2 today. So?


You can use it however you want. Throttling exists for the same reason that laws exist to prevent you from detonating dynamite on the road. You are sharing the road with others, and its main purpose is for getting from A to B.
In other words, throttling is just there to prevent you from hurting everyone else using the network, by downloading massive files. Do you actually have solid evidence of serious throttling in your area anyway? In my area, after a few seconds, bandwidth reduces to about 1/3 of max and stays there for minutes. This is still faster than my *home* internet connection (which has no throttling). I realize this may be different in your area.
But hey, if you don't want throttling, just use your phone on a WiFi connection instead of 3G/4G.
In general I think that argument is kind of insane -- no offense. If you buy an axe, and your only use case is to split people's heads open with it, then okay don't buy an axe.
What I'm saying though, is that there are reasonable use cases for the axe, that you might find useful -- go chop some wood with it.


Then, again, this is not about smartphones -- it is about the service area you are in.

But if you are spending more on electricity than you get back in bitcoins, you could likely get more coins for the same price by just buying coins, instead of spending that money on your electricity bill.
That 0.2 BTC/week will likely (IMO) be 0.02 BTC/week 6 months from now anyway, given ASICs.

If it's not pirate, then whoever it is doesn't mind if it looks like it's pirate.
*Edit:* As Marlath has so graciously pointed out for us: my data was behind. Apparently pirate made statements seconds after the move occurred, which doesn't tell us much either way about whether or not it was pirate. The large orders were still made by one person, whether it was pirate or not.

At this point in time, asking brick and mortar stores to accept bitcoins will hurt Bitcoin.
Ask physical retailers to accept bitcoins when there is some polished software (and hardware) that does this.
Saying to a retailer, "hey accept bitcoins!!" and then not being able to deliver them a product is just going to turn them off of bitcoins, and delay progress.

Read the rest of the comment you are responding to :)
Like I said in my comment, bitcoin currently inflates by 12.4% annually, which pays miners and therefore allows miners to be paid a high amount. This inflation will not exist in the future, and miners will be paid from a different source (tx fees).
Also, bitcoin is currently not fully mature so the number of transactions is low relative to the number of miners (compared to what we expect to see in the future).
Like I said in the comment you are replying to, when bitcoin's inflation rate is close to 0%, the transaction fees people are willing to pay is what will bound mining costs (unless for some reason miners are paid from a different source as well). I didn't say that electricity would be the majority expenditure, in fact I said the opposite -- I was only refuting the OPs claims about electricity costs. But more importantly, I said that the main factor that currently determines these fees (money supply inflation) will not exist in 20 years or so.

If he pays before Dec 31, 2012, pirate may win the bet. It depends on "the opinion of Bitcointalk.org members", who may decide that if pirate takes a few weeks to fully repay with all promised interest, that it was not a default.

In all likelyhood, you are not bottlenecked by network speed, you are bottlenecked by verification time.
The current database backend that the satoshi client uses does silly things during verification, which causes the blockchain sync to be bottlenecked by your HDD speed.
Just be patient for now, improvements to the satoshi client are on the way.
Verification goes slowest towards the end now, because there have been so many more transactions recently.

Some of the proposed methods for reducing blockchain storage size involve the use of merkle trees. Merkle trees aren't really used anywhere IRL (they have few applications), so there wasn't a reference implementation of one anywhere in the open source space.
socrates1024 created such a reference implementation, which makes it a little easier to implement better blockchain storage methods moving forward.

ASICs will reduce this botnet's income to 10% (or less) of what it is bringing in now.
If botnet owners are just selling these coins (rather than holding them as an investment, as many miners do with some of their coins), then this may mean fewer coins sold on the market after ASIC owners have paid off their ASICs.

Bitcoinica's failure had nothing to do with seeking approval from the New Zealand government.
In fact, as far as I know, the New Zealand government *did* give them approval.
Bitcoinica is also a very *very* ***very*** different service from cavirtex. Bitcoinica is offering contract-for-difference margin lending, dealing in multiple currencies.
cavirtex is just a CAD to BTC exchange.
In my opinion, they are just making excuses for lazily building a poor exchange, and now charging insane fees because they think they can -- since there is no other canadian exchange to compete with their service.
This is bad for Bitcoin and as a Canadian Bitcoin enthusiast/supporter, I find this very frustrating.

The bank had to pay because the only thing they did to authenticate the user was ask for user id and password.
If they had additional security questions, or if they had contacted the customer after the bank had flagged suspicious transactions, then they probably would not have had to pay.

The court ruled that the bank's security practices were not strong enough, so the bank was at fault.

@_date: 2012-07-12 01:18:36


It doesn't. Making it *illegal* might though.
If it's harder to get, then it is effectively scarcer -- you're cutting off a lot of the supply (*in the supply chain, not in the money supply*). This makes the price go up due to basic laws of supply and demand (people are willing to pay more to get something that is now harder to get).
However, the price will only go up if supply falls by at least less than demand does -- this would be the case if everyone was using bitcoin due to MegaBox's service.
Consider [prohibition](
When alcohol was made illegal in the USA, prices rose by several hundred percent on average (Warburton (1932), Fisher (1928)).
Alcohol became harder to obtain, but people still wanted it, so they had to pay extra to get some of the limited supply of it.
*Edit:* Apparently I'm getting a bunch of downvotes now because of AcidFiend's comment that essentially not enough people use bitcoin already in order for prohibition to help it.
But remember that the reason it is being made illegal in this scenario is because it would gain widespread use due to MegaBox. Making Bitcoin illegal wont happen overnight -- people will have plenty of time to start using bitcoin before the bitcoin prohibition.

Um no. If you can generate the keypair to lost coins, then the entire protocol is broken, because it is no harder to generate a keypair to a legitimate pair than it is to a "lost" pair.

It sounds like your concerns have more to do with data transmission and/or data plans than they have to do with smartphones.
Throttling should be irrelevant to you unless you are trying to download big files on your smart phone, which you generally shouldn't be trying to do. Download/upload stats are generally viewable on your phone if those are a concern -- or you can just not bother to use much data -- why do you need to?
Your smart phone sends SMS in exactly the same way as any other phone does.
My galaxy S2 is incredibly fast, and that phone is almost 2 years old. Besides, Java is not slow -- that is a myth. Well, it was true 10 years ago, but is not at all the case today.


No it isnt? Or even if you think it is, use Android 4.0 and don't upgrade to anything else for 3 years if you want to.


So don't do *those* things.
Sending a bitcoin from your phone is a few button clicks, and is about the same speed as sending a bitcoin from your home computer.
I think your issues might have more to do with internet access from your phone (and that being slow in your area perhaps) than it has to do with the phone itself.
My mom has a smartphone and doesn't really use the internet functionality of the phone, except to send an occasional email or something. It's also handy that she can listen to music on her phone.

When I said that MtGox was a secure option, I was talking about using MtGox with a yubikey or authenticator.


This is mostly not true if you are using MtGox, or any other service that uses an authenticator. If I know your password, I still can't access your coins.
That said, yes, there are more secure methods of storage than MtGox (as I cannot guarantee that MtGox has no security holes), but the OP would not have lost his coins if he chose to store them at MtGox with an authenticator, and *that* is the important point. There are good coin storage options, and you should expect to be able to securely store your coins with basically 0% chance of them being lost to password leakage, if you store them correctly.

Every time this happens, someone seems to feel that this is a subjective opinion and that there isn't evidence.
There is very clear, concrete evidence. All you need to do is watch the market depth on MtGox while it happens.
Look at this $400k (50k bitcoin) bid order that was there for only a few minutes:
That $400k order is a single person, whether or not they intentionally are causing havoc, I suppose we could say is subjective -- but to me it's pretty clear what their intent is when they place and remove orders like this (both buy and sell orders) and leave them open for only a few minutes at a time.

A little over 10 million coins have been mined, and I guess at least 100K people have bought some bitcoins at some point.
There were something like 30K registered users at bitcointalk when GPU mining started -- but how on earth is that relevant? That was a time when many miners were selling their bitcoins immediately to pay off their equipment costs. The transition from CPU-&gt;GPU mining was also a very short period of time where a very small amount of "extra" bitcoins were mined before network difficulty caught up.
More than 5 million coins will be mined over the next 4 years alone -- there is plenty of time and yet unmined coins to distribute, and mining is of course not the only way to get bitcoins.

There are 12000 different words in the king james bible.
5 *random* words from that set implies 12k^5 = 2.48x10^20 combinations.
The bitcoin network can hash 20000000000000 times per second.
Your password would be cracked in 144 days if it could be tried as fast as the bitcoin network can try to solve a block.
In reality, there are *far* fewer combinations than 1728000000000 combinations due to english grammar rules (such as the same word is never repeated three times in a row, etc.).
So your password would probably be cracked in a few hours, if it only had to try those combinations.

I don't think that something like freicoin has ever existed.
There is a guarantee with freicoin that your money loses 4.4% of it's value every year. The current US financial system for example, causes you to lose *about* 2% of your money every year, but can vary greatly.
The even bigger difference is that under freicoin, when your value is "lost", it is lost to *everyone else* equally. With the US dollar, your money is lost to a central authority.
The idea of freicoin is to encourage lending. You actually can gain on your money every year (rather than lose 4.4%), but you have to put your money to work to do so -- lend it out at an interest rate higher than 4.4%.

Is your dad relatively wealthy? 10 years is a long time -- is it going to make you both feel bad if he owes you say, $2000 at that time?
Are you going to just assume you're running the Jalapeno nonstop, even if it doesn't pay for electricity? Or will you stop mining when the Jalapeno costs more in electricity than it produces in coins?
One problem here is that the Jalapeno is slow -- about half the GH/s per dollar that you get from a mini SC or an SC single. I'm honestly not sure if you will make a profit on it that is higher than just buying $150 worth of coins, since the other available equipment is so much faster. (Though you may be able to plug it into the wall and overclock it.)
Of course you should still take the deal with your dad though, since there is no risk to you there.
To answer your question, yes you can track the profit but I don't think there is an easy tool out there to do this.
You just need historical difficulty, and the current price (assuming you don't sell any coins until the 10 year mark).
Consider changing the deal with your dad to 3 years. After a few years the Jalapeno will likely not pay for it's own electricity anyway. Just explain to your dad that you realized that the Jalapeno might not be creating enough bitcoins to pay for it's own electricity cost after a few years because mining difficulty is going to go up, so you'd have to turn off the Jalapeno after 3 years or so anyway.

If you try to send coins, does it ask you for a password? If it does, and you don't know the password, then you can't get these coins.
The easiest thing here is probably just to install a bitcoin client on your other computer, and then send coins to it.
Or set up a blockchain.info client, and send your coins to that.
I don't recommend trying to keep a copy of your wallet on multiple computers (when using the Satoshi client, which I think you are), because there is no guarantee that your two wallets will be synchronized.

That's great, but nothing stops them from offering units to their employees (or just board members) at cost, and then those employees can buy hundreds of units and mine on their own time.
The other ASIC providers can also do this.
It's also very hard to know how many of these will sell, and whether the price per unit will come down in the face of competition.

In all seriousness, I don't understand your hostility.
Your comment is bewildering to me.
The word deflation *in the title of the thread* refers to deflation of the money supply (or so I thought) -- that is the basis of the argument.
***Edit:*** Actually the argument about deflation causing hoarding applies to currencies with deflationary money supplies, but "deflation" in the title doesn't refer to money supply deflation. Sorry :)
So can you blame me for being confused by Baksh's comment/arguments?
The term "deflation of the money supply" does not have a different meaning in Austrian vs. Keynesian economics.

There are no fees to send/receive I think, the 0.5% fee is for converting USD to BTC (about the same fee that MtGox charges), which is not something that blockchain.info does.
I'm not affiliated with coinbase, but I like their project (edit: except for the bugs, which are worrisome). It makes bitcoin a easier to get started with than blockchain.info does, and it gives new users 0.1 BTC to play with.

Many bitcoin users are against (and/or are scared of) regulations like that and may frown upon it.
The way I imagine this would be managed would be to force users to lock in orders that are over a certain threshold for a certain period of time. For example, if you have $100k in orders, you would not be allowed to cancel your orders for an average of 1 hour. This would prevent market manipulation because it would be far riskier to leave an order open that you don't really intend to have filled.

You can't open a bank account without insurance.
So they all are certainly insured.
Whether that insurance covers the entirety of their account balance, I don't know.
FDIC insurance of the exchange account is really not the issue -- that insurance doesn't insure *your* money, it insures *their* money, which they owe to you. They danger of losing USD is comes from cases where the exchange may have their account balance frozen by the bank (as was the case with TradeHill).
I can't really think of another scenario where the exchange can lose your USD. They certainly can't easily take your money and run as you suggest -- they would probably be imprisoned.
You know who MtGox is. They can't just vanish without recourse. Your bitcoins could vanish in a hack (or a "hack"), but if they tried to steal your USD, MtGox would be sued and/or charges would be pressed.

The time to reach that equilibrium could be 2 months, or 24 months.

No, it is a reliable way of redistributing the odds over your bets. If the house takes a cut, then you still expect to lose overall.
The odds of losing many times in a row goes down, but the amount you lose when you finally do lose goes up proportionately.
For example, the odds of losing 4 bets in a row with 1/2 probability of winning each is 1/16 -- much lower than playing a single bet with odds of 1/2 of losing. But the amount you lose in 4 losing bets in a row is also 31 times higher.

Then I recommend wiring to MtGox. It will be the cheapest option for that amount of money.
Be sure to buy a small amount every day over a long period of time -- do not buy all in at once.
a) The market depth at the moment is shallow and you will move the price and hurt yourself in the short term.
b) The price is volatile at the moment, and buying all in at once is not much better than gambling -- buying in slowly over time (AKA dollar cost averaging) mitigates the risk of exposing yourself to the price volatility.

Does pirate strike you as being a wallstreet investor?
The behavior I've seen from pirate (and the activity on MtGox) certainly do not suggest to me that pirate is trying to reduce volatility. He has claimed to be responsible for dumping large amounts of coins all at once. Price stability comes from maintaining high market depth, which comes from a wide acceptance that the current spot price is close to where it should be. Dumping huge amounts of coins suddenly is the exact opposite of what you want for price stability.
I don't want to spend too much time debating this with you, because the debate will be answered loud and clear when pirate defaults sometime in the next few months.
I hope that my arguments against pirate have at least mitigated the damage he's doing to this community.

I can't speak for everyone, but I care when people start buying into BS&amp;T. If no one speaks out against it, then many more people buy into BS&amp;T, all of whom necessarily are bitcoin users.
Then when BS&amp;T collapses, many bitcoin users get hurt. Many more than would have been hurt, if someone made some sobering analysis of why it is likely that BS&amp;T is a ponzi.
Losing their bitcoins in BS&amp;T is going to hurt, and they are going to associate that negative experience with Bitcoin.
Not to mention that the ponzi collapses much sooner if much fewer people put bitcoins into it, and so, fewer people get hurt. In my opinion, anyone who put money into BS&amp;T contributed to a larger number of bitcoin users getting hurt.
So I think that's why I've spoken out against putting money BS&amp;T, and why I care where Bitcoin users are putting their money. I don't think I've thrown any of the kind of personal insults you've mentioned though, so I can't answer for the people who have.

They can definitely be stolen or lost, but I think that they are less vulnerable than fiat, though we could make a pros/cons list here.
After all, you can store bitcoins in your brain, but fiat must be either stored in physical form, or entrusted to a bank where it can be seized (that point depends on your definition of "lost" and "stolen").
If you think that QE3 counts as losing your fiat, then you cant control when a central party decides to take away the value of your fiat -- maybe I shouldn't go there, since it's probably off topic to start discussing.

Since throwaway-o isn't explaining, I will try to clear things up :)
The blockchain "online wallet" you speak of decrypts your data *client side* in your browser -- not server side.
Blockchain does not store user passwords in their database. That is throwaway's main point here.
If blockchain was discovered to be storing user passwords (somehow) in their database, it would be a pretty big scandal. The reason that blockchain's wallet is so popular is because it doesn't have access to your private keys, because it doesn't store your password.
I think the confusion here is that the data that Roger Ver showed you does not contain the user's password, just his "secret phrase", which is not the same thing. The information needed to decrypt his wallet is not there.
That said, you have a point that he did reveal his secret phrase, which could have been treated more sensitively.

You mean the FPGA BitForce single? I don't recommend that you buy that. ASICs are plausibly coming out soon.
The number of coins you generate per hash/s depends on network difficulty, which depends on the total amount of hash power out there. The more hash power on the network in total, the higher difficulty rises, in order to enforce the rule that only 50 BTC should be mined per 10 minutes on average. (The block reward is reducing to 25 BTC per 10 minutes sometime in November.)
Here are some historical difficulty charts:
The red line is the difficulty.
Currently a bitforce single at 800MH/s will generate about 0.3 bitcoins per day.
If ASICs are released, then the network difficulty will skyrocket to something like maybe 10x the current difficulty a few months from now. In that case the same bitforce single at 800MH/s would generate 0.03 bitcoins per day.

More importantly, it takes years in the cost you pay in electricity to run one ASIC to add up to the cost of the ASIC itself.
E.g. buy a Jalapeno for $150, spend $150 in electricity on it over the course of (let's suppose) 10 years.
So reducing the cost of electricity to ZERO will at best double your income over a 10 year period, and therefore something like only +10% profit over the first year.
As you can see, this doesn't have a huge impact.

Well, did you notice that he seems pro-democracy, however he doesn't feel that the current form of democracy gives you as much choice as it could?
Seasteading gives you the ability to choose any form of government you prefer, by visiting/migrating to the seastead that has the form of government you like.
This is wildly different from current government, in that a seastead is a very small community compared to a state or a country, so you get far more political power directly from the *size* of the community, but also due to your ability to leave and choose a different form of government (by choosing a different seastead).
So I agree with your points, except that they don't seem to address seasteading in particular.

Yes, but there is a higher chance of everyone you have ever met being struck dead by lightning tomorrow.
It is more likely that you will drop dead of an aneurysm at the moment you read this sentence.
If you stored a bitcoin address using 1 atom for each bit stored, you would not have enough atoms in the universe^* to store all the addresses.
Put simply, compared to the risk of address collision that you take when storing bitcoins, the risk you take every day during any number of activities is absolutely MASSIVE by comparison.


The chance of enough bits on your computer flipping due to cosmic ray interaction is probably higher than address collision probability. So **even if you reduce it to "zero", you are still exposed many much worse higher probability events** to all of the other random crap that can happen -- like a house fire, or cosmic rays striking your HDD platter, or dying of a car accident, etc.

Why would it?
The number of bitcoins mined stays the same no matter what the difficulty is, so difficulty does not affect supply.
Difficulty also does not affect demand. If anything, new people joining the Bitcoin community may buy coins due to a higher difficulty instead of mining them. It certainly does not reduce demand though.


If supply the supply of bitcoins goes down, then it reduces downward pressure on price.
Think about it, 7200 bitcoins are being mined every day, and those can be sold at any time, and many are. If the bitcoin mining reward suddenly went to 0, there would be 7200 fewer bitcoins *per day* that can be sold.


There is plenty of disagreement about where the price will go, but it is widely agreed that it will not go down due to difficulty changes or block reward reductions.

No, the GPU is doing it on behalf of the CPU. When someone asks you to do something, and you do it, you are doing it on their behalf -- not the other way around.
Also, a very small amount of CPU processing is required to do this. On a modern CPU, mining only requires a fraction of a percent of the CPU time.
If you are seeing your mining software use more than 10% CPU time, then you most likely are using one of the bugged ATI drivers.

That is the opposite of what I said :) "Useless" work = higher stability. This is because the work doesn't stop being useless. Useful work, on the other hand, can become useless (like in the case of folding, when a cancer cure is found).
Or to put it another way:
If the work was helping to solve cancer, then the currency would be more valuable because of that.
If cancer was cured, then the work would no longer be useful for finding a cancer cure.

I discovered a vulnerability in ferroh.com the other day (now patched), but guess what?
ferroh.com's wallet is completely offline. Yes, you can deposit coins. Yes, you can withdraw coins. But all withdraws are done manually, and an email is sent to the user at the time that the withdrawal is requested.
The withdrawal is then sent several hours after this email goes out, so users always have a chance to say wait, that isn't me. And admins always have a chance to say, hmm, I don't think that coins being withdrawn from every single account is a legitimate request.
I think most sites (and their users, honestly) put too high a value on being able to instantly deposit/withdraw.
For [mining contracts]( for example, this is a year long investment -- you can wait 3 hours to complete a withdrawal or deposit in order to reduce the probability of your coins being stolen by a couple of orders of magnitude.

Actually it probably took you 2 days to verify the history due to a HDD bottleneck in the current client.
In 0.8 bitcoin-qt verifies much faster, so if you have a fast connection then you will do the initial sync faster.
Anyway, the short answer to your question is that you do not need to store the entire chain, only the part of it relevant to you, and SPV clients do this. Multibit is the only true SPV client AFAIK.
You could also use Electrum which requires a little bit of trust in the server, but does not require you to store the chain.
For your (Android) phone, you can use the blockchain.info client that does not require you to store any of the chain (requiring you to trust blockchain.info to tell you the correct information). If this client gives you the wrong information, it could make you think that you have a different amount of coins than you really have, but it can't steal coins from you.
Apple on the other hand does not allow bitcoin clients in the appstore, but you could use blockchain.info's mobile site from your phone.

That doesn't happen no matter what the fee is. The amount you choose to send is sent, and the fee is deducted from your wallet separately.
In other words, if you send $100000 and there is a $1 fee, then $100001 will be deducted from your wallet balance, and the receiving address will receive $100000.

Okay, yes.
However, it is still an O( 2^n ) problem with classical machines and an O( 2^n ) problem with quantum machines.
So if you double the number of bits to 512, then it is not theoretically solvable with a quantum machine either.
~~(Contrast with SHA-256, which is solvable in O( 2^n ) time with classical machines, but is solved in O( n ) time with quantum machines.)~~ *Edit: Was wrong about that part. SHA-256 is also O( 2^n ) on quantum machines.*

If a single organization (like a government) held most of the coins, then this may be hazardous to the health of bitcoin. (Because it would be unsettling to know that one organization has a majority of the bitcoin wealth.)

I think what this card is missing is a QR code with a private key with 0.001 BTC on it, for someone to start playing with.
The second constructive criticism I have, is that in my opinion, it's not an ideal marketing strategy to say why it's good "for everyone" but not why it's good for *you*.
It should mention that it's cash for the internet (or something) so that the reader can start to imagine why this product is awesome, and why they might want to use it.
I like that this card focuses on the "open source" point -- this is compelling for a certain audience. We also need to develop another card that targets people who are not motivated by open source (some people just aren't, like it or not).

You know that shadow banking is not illegal or "off the grid" right?
It is things like mortgage bonds, which are traded by wall street investment banks.
A mortgage bond is an instrument that essentially takes a bunch of mortgages, and packs them together into one tradeable instrument. The reason this is "shadowy" is that these bonds hide the risk of the debt. When things like this get A rated, even though they are risky, it causes big problems -- which is what happened in the 2008 financial collapse.
Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, all made huge money by using instruments like these during that collapse.
Shadow banking refers to the tools that wall street uses to milk society.

If BFL ships all of their currently ordered ASICs, then I would be surprised if the difficulty didn't at least triple. 
Currently total network hash rate is about 17 terahashes. That costs about $500k worth of SC Singles to match. We know they have received $250k just on the first day of sales.
Once the units start shipping, expect many more of these to hit the market (and be in use by BFL in-house).
Over the next year, network hash rate could increase by a factor of 25 (taking into account block rate halving), so that the breakeven point for this hardware is about 1 year.

First of all, there are many bitcoin clients. Bitcoin is just a protocol, like HTML.
To view HTML, you can use many clients (Chrome, Firefox, Opera).
Similarly, to use Bitcoin there are many Bitcoin clients.
You are using the Satoshi client, and that client decided to implement "accounts" which are simply a collection of addresses.
The idea was that it would be useful if more than one person wanted to use your client (like if the client was being used as a backend to a website for example, you could have one account per user).
In reality, the accounts feature of the Satoshi client in my opinion is kind of useless. If you want accounts for your website, then you manage addresses in your own database.


Yes, they all belong to the same account.


That analogy makes no sense to me.
Your wallet is a UPS store. Addresses are the PO boxes at the UPS store (101-100 Main St., 102-100 Main St., ...), and accounts are for UPS to keep track of who owns which PO boxes (John owns PO boxes 101, 102, 103, and Mary owns PO boxes 104, 105, 106).

You will find many people who do not subscribe to the definition of fiat where it is a currency that must be backed by a government.
One of my points here, is that you should not argue with those people, because you will not win, because they are not wrong. Besides, it's not important whether Bitcoin is fiat or isn't.
Your definition of fiat is precise, but it is not in the spirit of the word. fiat is latin for "let it be done", and *fiat money* is meant to describe the concept of a points system that we create out of thin air, and decide has value.
Wikipedia's own definition of fiat money does not require the money to be backed by a government.
TLDR: If you want to redefine fiat as "government backed currency", that's fine with me. I'm just letting you know that many people do not view this word in the way you've defined it.

I think we all know this, though I'm not sure what you mean by "blind transfers of coin" (no one is encouraging that?).
Until very recently we've been missing good methods of allowing businesses to easily accept bitcoins, and we've been missing a vote of confidence from large businesses.
Now we have things for merchants like coinbase and bitpay (which has much improved over the past year), making it easy to tell merchants to accept bitcoin as payment. Two years ago, asking a business to accept bitcoin as payment meant asking them to implement their own payment system for accepting bitcoins, which is not very attractive for many businesses.
We also are now seeing bigger businesses accept bitcoin, like WordPress.
I expect to see increased merchant adoption now that we can say, "hey, WordPress accepts bitcoins, you should use coinbase or bitpay to accept bitcoins too!".

The bitcoin developers are clever guys, and socrates deserves respect for making this.
(Socrates1024 is not on the core bitcoin-dev team AFAIK, btw).
However, let's not overstate things.
The merkle tree that he implemented is basically 80-100 lines of python code.
It's awesome that he implemented it, but opensource is a tiny surface of the total written code out there. I technically write code every day for which there is "no opensource implementation". Implementing this merkle tree as written is mostly just a matter of following a whitepaper on the subject.
This merkle tree didn't exist in open source because few people have a use for merkle trees, not because it's impossibly difficult to write (not to say that there weren't challenges for socrates1024 along the way).
Here's the code in question:

I tried to find the M of N transaction page on blockchain.info for you, but I don't see this page anywhere. You were able to find this? What is the address of that page?


I've never used BCI's escrow but to send using M of N you will just need the public addresses, and you don't need them in your wallet.
To *spend* from the addresses the transaction was sent to, you need to have access to M of the addresses. This means that you might as well have them in your wallet in that case.
The case you want I guess is where you don't have access to those addresses. Point me at blockchain.info's M of N page and I'll see if that works, otherwise you want to use the *signrawtransaction* API command.

BIP 19 will never be implemented. There is nothing in it to implement, it's just a suggestion for one way to do M of N with the current client. (You can already do M of N using the raw transaction API introduced in 0.7, it just isn't super easy.)

Even if coins are sold outside of the exchange, this still dampens the price. Not necessarily by as much.
I can't 100% disprove that 100% of the price rise isn't caused by BFL purchases, but it is certainly not a simple explanation (since bit-pay must be selling outside of major exchanges, and whoever is buying from bit-pay must be willing to continue to buy despite a sudden increase in the number of coins available from bit-pay, etc).
Consider the fact that there is a major player buying 70k coins on MtGox at the moment too -- this explains the price rise in a simpler way, at least.

I imagine they would prefer that to receiving 0 BTC back, which is a real possibility.

I feel like this is a good place to point out that there is a single buyer with a single buy order of about 70k bitcoins. That is only an order that is visible on MtGox. He could have more dollars than that in MtGox, who knows.

If people have bought bitcoins for the very first time just so that they could get BFL equipment, then yes.
The big player with a 70k bitcoin order on MtGox has a lot more to do with the price rise. (Of course, I can't say that he isn't buying BFL equipment for sure, but it's not likely, since for an order that large, he would contact BFL directly and avoid the 3% bit pay fee).

You don't have to argue that politics doesn't change anything in order to argue that technology can massively change the world.
Democracy obviously changed the world, but it took a long time (and probably some bloodshed) compared to how long it took the iPhone or the internet.
Besides, there are some things that politicians can't really be expected to change. Politicians can't reasonably solve climate change -- they can only invest into tech that does this (or try to force everyone to stop using their cars, but is that reasonable?).
Note though, that we don't (usually) need politicians to invest/endorse tech to see this happen.
The important point of this talk to me, is that we should recognize the world changing potential of the three techs he mentions (Seasteading, Bitcoin, 3D printing), and support them so that they can change the world faster.

The reason I speak with confidence is not due to "blindness" but due to an understanding of probabilities.


I said that he did not change the bet size due to a usage of Martingale.
The links you gave show that the SDice owner was not comfortable with the variance.
This has nothing to do with Martingale. If he made only one bet size available, and set a 1% fee, then he would still see the same variance, and probably would still be uncomfortable with it.


Except that his max bet size is very low (250BTC at the moment), so if you play Martingale once starting with a 1BTC bet, then the maximum rounds of martingale you can play are just 9.
So you have a 1/512 chance of losing 505 BTC.
That probability is for just one martingale play, and is really not comparable to the probabilities involved in finding an address collision (where there might not be enough energy in our solar system to compute all the addresses...).
The point I'm really trying to make though is that Martingale has ***no effect whatsoever*** on Satoshi Dice's expected profit, and is actually ***safer*** for SDice for people to play martingale than it would be for everyone to just bet at the max bet.
Try thinking of it this way:
Imagine every SDice user plays martingale. They all start at 1BTC and play potentially up to the 250 BTC max bet.
Everyone playing martingale at random times is similar to everyone just picking random bets to play at random times. To satoshi dice, it doesn't matter.
Or if you prefer, think of it this way:
What martingale does, is gives you a high chance of winning a small amount of money, and small chance of losing a large amount of money.
So if you play martingale over and over, it's like playing a single bet with a e.g. 1% chance of losing 101 BTC and a 99% chance of gaining 1BTC.
So if you play it 100 times, you expect in the long run to gain 1 BTC 99 times and then lose 101 BTC 1 time for a total loss of 2 BTC.
Everyone playing martingale on satoshidice ***is the exact same thing*** as one person playing martingale over and over. Satoshidice loses a small amount each time until they make a big win.
So unless you think that playing martingale yourself over and over is a good strategy (I hope you don't), then hopefully you can see now that from SDice's perspective, one person playing martingale over and over is the same thing as everyone playing Martingale, and this is the same as everyone essentially playing a high chance of small win, low chance of big loss bet repeatedly.
I hope this helps!

If pirate has access to data sooner than me, then this could explain the misunderstanding.


Pirate is running a ponzi. It is known that he has at least $250k worth of bitcoins (probably a lot more). He has the ability to place large MtGox orders, and he has incentive to do so, as has been pointed out by zooko (and for some reason, again by you, despite this agreeing with my point).

But again, the lending still occurs as long as the asset doesn't appreciate so much that it is more than the industry lending rate.
Suppose bitcoin appreciates by 3% per year, and borrowers are borrowing dollars at an 8% rate. And dollars depreciate by say 2% per year, then borrowers are really paying about 6% on their dollar loans.
Bitcoin lenders would then lend at a 3% rate, since they are really going to get paid back a total of 6% including the bitcoin 3%/year appreciation.
So in this case lending in bitcoin occurs at a 3%/year rate and lending in dollars occurs at a 8%/year rate (but the total return for lenders is equal in either case, and the total needed to be paid back by borrowers is equal in either case).
Now if bitcoins appreciate by 7%/year, then we have a problem -- bitcoin lenders would have to charge -1%/year to attract borrowers, in order for borrowers to get a loan at a rate that competes with the dollar.
As long as bitcoins appreciate less than 7%/year in this scenario though, lending still occurs. (And in the long run, bitcoin appreciation will be stable and much smaller than 7% per year. In fact, bitcoin appreciation due to supply changes is eventually 0% -- just like gold.)

In my interpretation, Kim DotCom has hinted at accepting bitcoin in his future music distribution service, as has The Pirate Bay (as a method to offer ad-free subscriptions).
Whether you accept bitcoins or not will have no effect on whether Kim DotCom or TPB accept bitcoins. 
Now, imagine that you have a bunch of users pirating music, and these users also have some extra bitcoins lying around.
Being ahead of the curve and offering these people the ability to buy music with the bitcoins that they have lying around could be a huge advantage for you. These are people that want to get music, and have bitcoins lying around -- so where are they likely to spend their extra coins?
Currently, TPB doesnt accept bitcoins, and Kim DotCom hasn't launched his new service, but being prepared for these possibilities is well worth the relatively small amount of time it takes to implement bitcoin payments.

I can tell you that the Canadian bitcoin exchange includes sales tax in their commissions.

I could complain about their FPGAs cooling problems, or the terrible power supplies, or the very long (several month) delivery time, or maybe something else.
However, I think the only important facts about the FPGAs in relation to the ASICs, is that BFL clearly produced these units (they have BFL's logo on the PCB), and that they do more or less what they say they do.
That said, this doesn't tell us very much about whether ASICs will be delivered, or how profitable the ASICs will be if/when they are delivered.
I think that BFL is going with something like Altera's hardcopy to produce sASICs. I suspect that in order for them to meet the specs they've outlined, they might need a very expensive production run.
This means that they either are producing a ton of chips for themselves as well, which will dilute your profit and could greatly change the projected difficulty increase.
It's also possible that if there is a serious flaw in the hardware, that they won't be able to deliver at all -- unless they can find or already have the funds to pay additional manufacturing costs.
We are talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars just to do 135nm process. Maybe they found a great deal on 65nm process sASICs somehow.
It's a risky investment, don't bet the farm on it.
BFL may have decided they see an opportunity to take a million dollars (plus) and run, they may fail to meet demands, someone may press charges against BFL for selling a product that they have not yet produced (illegal in most/all? states), they may inflate the difficulty by producing 10x more units than they sell.
They could turn on 1000 of these things just 1 week before launch and by the time they get into your hands the difficulty could be a factor of 5 higher.
Again, feel free to invest in these, please just know that you are making a very risky investment -- so keep the investment reasonable -- use funds that you can afford to lose.
The number one scary factor at the moment (in my opinion) is that it is now almost September, and they have zero pictures of any ASIC related anything. They should be producing at least the PCBs for these things by now, or have the coffee warmer cases ready for display, if they expect to meet demand by their October shipping estimate.

There would be little point in such a service since bitcoin trade fees are generally percentage based with no fixed base fee (unlike say stock brokerage fees which have a fixed fee plus a percentage, e.g. $9 + $0.10 per share).
So if you put $1 of bitcoins in say, Mt. Gox, you can make tiny trades such as 0.001 bitcoins for roughly a 0.000006 bitcoin fee per trade.
Basically I'm saying that you can just trade $1 worth of bitcoins for real instead of mock trading. The only disadvantage to this is that you will pay the highest tier fee at Mt. Gox, which is 0.6% per trade. If you traded high volume you would get closer to 0.25% per trade.
Rounding of trade fees might screw with your results a bit, so I recommend choosing a larger amount if you can, say $100. This should make fee rounding negligible as long as you are trading $1 worth of coins at a time.

That is not the only solution.
If an asset gains less per year than a borrower is willing to pay in interest per year, then a loan can still take place with that asset.
For example if bitcoin increases in value by 4% per year, but a borrower is willing to pay 10% per year on a loan, then a lender can still make a bitcoin loan at about 6% interest per year (and will do so).

Buying Bitcoins is an investment into Bitcoin. It helps the cause of bitcoin, which could positively impact the world. Bitcoin could create value (and/or reduce waste via efficiency increases) that helps *everyone* involved, and even eventually helps those that chose not to be involved now. It is not completely zero sum, and there is no ponzi scheme owner that is waiting for the right moment to walk away with all of the funds.

Keep in mind that the price goes back up when he buys the coins back that he needs to pay investors.
This plan only works if people are scared enough to actually sell $1 million worth of coins to pirate without moving the price up.


Yes, but people who invested in pirate in the beginning are getting nearly 3x their coins in return (notice that pirate gets very little, if he chooses this route).
Pirate needs to:
- shock the market into selling all the way down to ~$6 (or less)
- buy all his coins back at $6 without moving the price up (or buy back at an avg. price of ~$6)
- do all this within the next 10 days.
It's possible, but unlikely, and therefore probably not pirate's plan.
If the market is scared down to some low price, pirate might have been handed an opportunity, but it's very unlikely that this was his *plan* all along.
In the end it depends what his goals are.
If running with the money is really an option for him, why not try to maximize profit instead? This would be done by slowly selling off coins over several months, not by shocking the market to new lows and risking losing half of his coins value.

The next sentence after your quote on that wikipedia page is: " The term fiat currency is also used when the fiat money is used as the main currency of the country. "
If bitcoin were the main currency of a country it would fit that definition.

In this video they mention purchasing with online debit pin.
I tried to implement online debit pin -&gt; bitcoin purchasing.
However I found that even online debit transactions are reversible, and the companies that I found that implemented online debit-pin in North America punish you severely when a client does a reversal.
Reversals are much rarer for debit-pin at least, but I doubt that will be the case for long, if you start offering bitcoins for debit. (It's not *that* hard to discover someone's pin.)

That never happened. Pirate is just some guy running a ponzi, claiming all sort of things to get people to believe that maybe he has some amazing magical ability to give 1%/day interest. Even if BS&amp;T somehow is legit, he did not (and did not even claim to) hack an exchange.
To answer your question:
No one here knows, and don't believe anything they tell you unless that have significant evidence to support their claims.
Some possibilities are:
- The Bitcoin userbase is growing -- more people are learning about and buying Bitcoins.
- There has been lots of recent press about bitcoin (the armory, the silk road, etc), and that could cause either the previous point (attracted new users) or it could be causing current bitcoin investors to buy in anticipation of new users joining due to the recent press.
- Bitcoinica closed, and it was basically the only way to short BTC -- if that's part of the reason, we could be in a bit of a bubble that is not being dampened by would be bitcoin shorters.
- Growing popularity of new deposit methods like BitInstant, BitFloor, could be making it easy for new and existing users to buy bitcoins where it was harder to do so before.
- Speculators are buying coins with the knowledge that the block reward is halving soon.
Don't be confused if the price crashes back to $5 or goes up to $20 in the next couple of months either. We may very well see lots of price volatility while we're still in a stage where we have a very limited number of products sold for bitcoins (and so not very much to tie the price to bitcoins), and limited market depth on the exchanges due to a limited number of active traders (compared to bigger markets like oil, gold, USD), and a lack of margin tools, futures, etc.

I don't know if this is really called "escrow", since there is no 3rd party involved.
*TLDR of this method:*
Person A sends funds to person B, but first all funds are locked up.
The funds are locked up in such a way that neither person A or B can access the funds unless he gets a key from the other user.
In a situation where you were going to send funds to someone irreversibly, instead you could lock the funds up in a way that he knows that you can't get the funds back without his consent. So you only release the funds if he delivers whatever product.
This could be useful sometimes, but doesn't suit all transactions.

Obviously not, but that is not the argument I made.
If gold does not increase in value, and bitcoin increases in value by 4% per year, then the bitcoin loan would be at 2% (for at return to the lender of 6% including the bitcoin value increase).
So in this scenario, lending gold (that does not appreciate) at 6% or bitcoin (which appreciates at 4%/year) at 2% would be about equal.
So as I've been trying to explain, lending an asset that increases in value work as long as the increase in value of the asset is less than what the borrower is willing to pay in interest.
We would have a problem in this scenario if borrowers were only willing to pay 10%/year, but bitcoins increase in value by 15%/year. In this case, borrowers would have to get a loan at -5%/year in order to really pay back bitcoins at a rate of 10%/year, because the bitcoins that they owe will be worth 15%/year more.

I think if there has been a red flag, it's that one of the company founders (I think he's a founder, or if not, then he's at least on the board), was revealed to have a criminal history. He did 2 years in jail for a financial crime.
For me the bigger risk is that the fact that BFL delivered FPGAs does not tell us much about whether they can deliver ASICs -- there's a big tech leap here.

It has already been highlighted many times, and solutions are known. Bitcoin isn't big enough yet (i.e. the dev team isn't big enough or full-time-enough yet) to rapidly implement these solutions, although work is being done on them.
So I could have said that this is "how to increase load on bitcoin unecessarily fast, before bitcoin is ready for it".
We don't have a robust light client yet, which would make this okay. Satoshidice has tripled the blockchain size in a few months, and is making it harder to see new users adopt bitcoin while we wait for a light client to be available for them.

More expensive for whom?
The loans will have the same overall rate of return (though their interest rates will differ based on how much the asset being lent appreciates).
Loans in a deflationary currency will have a lower interest rate (but the same rate of return overall).
If bitcoins are expected to appreciate by 2% per year then a loan in bitcoin will have a 2% per year lower interest rate than an asset that is expected to appreciate by 0%.
How do you know that this won't ***encourage lending***?
After all, it might seem like a better deal to the lender to borrow at 4% in bitcoins rather than 6% in gold, (if gold does not appreciate and bitcoins appreciate by 2% per year). This would give more flexibility to the lender.

He has investor's funds, but not the interest, and he is delaying to the last minute, just in case the market hands him an opportunity to buy a ton of coins at a low price, and pay everyone.
Or perhaps he is simply making preparations to dissappear.
There's no reason for him to default prematurely.
Maybe he just wants to give people a chance to come to terms with their loss, before they seek him out in a fit of rage and kill him.
Whatever it he's doing, if his *plan* is to crash the price, it's the worst plan ever (or at least, it's *extremely* risky). He can't crash the price without removing most of the market depth on the bid side. He'd need to somehow get $1 million in ask orders to average out to about ~$6 within the next week or so -- there's no way he expects to be able to make that happen.

If ASICs get replaced every year, then you shouldn't really view them as a fixed cost, actually.
So no, the cost could be a *lot* higher than the electricity cost.
If you buy a $1000 ASIC and it costs $100 in electricity to run it for two years, and then you replace it with another $1000 ASIC after those two years pass, then your costs per two years are around $550/year. Electricity costs were only $50/year, but your total costs were much higher.

Any non-backwards-compatible change in bitcoin is referred to as a fork, since at the release of the new bitcoin client, not everyone will be conforming to the new rules (many people continue to use very old clients).
Anyways, whether you call it a fork or not, I hope they don't start using two different key algorithms, that is just messy. It results in the same thing as demurrage in the hypothetical you propose, except that some people would wind up spending time mining old addresses instead of mining blocks.


It has been discussed literally hundreds of times, and a majority is against such a change. That opinion may change when less than 1% of the bitcoins are left, and major changes like subdividing coins further are being made.
More importantly, realize that the change you propose is not very different from demurrage. If the community is against my form of demurrage, then why would they not be against your form of demurrage?
Also realize that we are talking about a change that if it happens, likely wont happen for many years.

So? You can trade Microsoft stock for currency, if that makes a difference to you. Microsoft stock rewarded early adopters.
Bitcoin is not designed to reward early adopters by the way. Coins are mined fastest in the beginning in order to prevent the earliest adopters from massively benefitting compared with those who join in a little later.
There are many years of opportunity to buy bitcoins. It has been 4 years, hundreds of thousands of people have bought bitcoins, and no one person has become wildly rich as a result of investing into bitcoin.
Widespread availability and the continuing relatively fast production of new coins for the next dozen years prevents bitcoin from massively benefitting earliest adopters compared with many stocks out there.
Of course early bitcoin adopters benefit more than late adopters -- this is the reward for essentially investing into early bitcoin development. Buying bitcoin late does not help build the early development needed to make bitcoin useful for everyone. So buying bitcoin early is very much like buying a stock in a tech company.


This sentence contradicts itself. How can you see bitcoin as a stepping stone to a better world, yet believe that bitcoin mass adoption wouldn't help the world?
If it is a stepping stone to a better world, then mass bitcoin adoption would help the world.

If cavirtex had an API (that clients keep requesting and that EVERY other exchange has), then cavirtex prices would be better, and would more accurately reflect market prices due to arbitrage bots moving funds around quickly.
cavirtex volume would be a lot higher if they had a better service, in my opinion. Offering a better service might attract more canadians to buying bitcoins.

If you think you got bitcoins, but it turns out that you got coins that are in a block that is going to be abandoned in 10 minutes, then you effectively received counterfeited bitcoins.
If you understand that, but don't think this is "counterfeiting", then this is just a semantic debate -- the point is that you can trick someone into thinking they got coins that will continue to be on the blockchain years from now, but they got coins that only had value for a few minutes instead -- and that is the essence of what people understand "counterfeiting" to mean.

Your logic is totally backwards.
If the price of a bitcoin rises, it makes it *harder* -- not easier -- for him to pay you a return, because he owes you bitcoins.
If he somehow knew that the price of a bitcoin was going to *fall* fast, then it might be reasonable to offer a high return.
Since he owes you *bitcoins* on your bitcoin investment, if the price of a bitcoin skyrockets then he owes even more.
E.g. If he takes your 1 bitcoin investment, and then the price of a bitcoin rises 180%, how does that help him give you a 180% return? He now owes you 1.8 bitcoins, but he still only has 1 bitcoin from you, regardless of what the price of a bitcoin is.
On the other hand, if he took 1 bitcoin from you and sells it, and then the price of a coin falls 90%, then he can buy back 10 bitcoins and pay you the 1.8 he owes you (and he makes a large profit).

I think it is exactly the opposite of this.
If they are used to trading stocks, and have hundreds of thousands to throw at a bitcoin trade, they most certainly have a good idea about how market depth works.
I think that they understood that buying up $350k slowly would have pushed the price up more than $0.20/bitcoin.
That is a small move for the amount that they put in. They took advantage of the big wall at $12.

- Mining difficulty does not affect the price.
- The block reward reducing means less coins will be sold, which means the price goes *up* (not down), as a result. This is very possibly a part of what is driving the recent upward price movement.

For those who ordered earlier, ***if*** they actually come through, then yes I think it will be worth it (breakeven in 6 months or less). I think this simply because difficulty has to rise by a factor of 25 to make them breakeven in 1 year, but they have only sold enough to increase difficulty by a factor of 3-5. The rest of the difficulty increase will come from what they use to mine on their own, plus all the sales after people see that they are actually shipping the product.
If you were to order now, that's less certain -- who knows when you'll get one. I still think it will be worth it (again, *assuming that they actually deliver* in a reasonable time frame).
Be aware that this is still a very risky investment, because whether they can deliver is still uncertain, and lots of things can go wrong. Don't invest anything you can't afford to lose.

The proposed problem is that borrowers don't want to borrow an asset that is gaining value, not that lenders don't want to lend.
This is really only a problem if the asset is gaining value faster than the amount of interest you would like to charge. If bitcoins gain 2% per year on average when they become stable, then as a lender you can just charge 2% lower interest per year to compensate.
The problem is when bitcoin gains 30% per year, and a borrower is only willing to pay 10% per year interest -- then he wont borrow and the lender won't lend.

That makes no sense.
If you lend out 100 bitcoins and charge 10% per year interest, and your borrower pays you back after 1 year, now you have 110 bitcoins.

Here are some quotes from the article:
- &gt; "Forms of shadow banking can include securitization, which can transform bank loans into a tradeable instrument that can then be used to refinance credit, making it easier to lend."
- &gt; "Another example is a repurchasing agreement, or repo, where a player such as a hedge fund could sell government bonds it owns to a bank, agreeing to repurchase them later."
Also check out wikipedia on the subject:

I would start the video at [4:31]( to save you a few minutes.
The first few minutes are not very good IMO, but after that Tony Gallippi starts making a strong argument for why businesses should choose to accept bitcoins instead of credit cards online.
TLDR of his argument: Credit cards were not designed for the internet, and as a result, have poor online security, and waste an enormous amount of resources on losses to fraud and poor attempts at fraud prevention. Credit cards also handle international payments very poorly, both online and in person. Bitcoins solves those issues.

That is true. As long as you understand that your expected profit/loss is negative (because the loss with 0.1% chance is very large).
What Martingale essentially does, is gives you a high chance of small win, low chance of big loss bet.
E.g. 99% chance of 1 BTC win, 1% chance of 101 BTC loss. So if you play that bet 100 times, you expect to lose 2 BTC overall.

It is perhaps a DDOS effect, but it is not a DDOS *attack*.
It only broadcasts as many transactions as its users request.
It is certainly harmful to bitcoin in the short term, but it is debated whether it is bad for bitcoin in the long term.
In the short term, it is bloating the chain before we have implemented software that makes it easy for users to do a quick bitcoin client install despite that (e.g. a SPV node client).
In the long term, one might argue that SDice is motivating developers to focus on making sure the network can easily handle the SDice traffic.
In my opinion, there is no good reason why SDice can't set a higher minimum size on each transaction (e.g. 0.001 bitcoins) to limit the really spammy transactions. And there is little benefit to spamming the chain as much as they do, but there is harm in it as I've seen some negative reactions by new users to a 3GB chain sync.

He claims that he didn't, but the evidence is pretty damning. MtGox and CryptoXchange came forward with evidence that he took the most recent Bitcoinica loss. Zhou Tong denied this and then ~90 minutes later magically discovered who the real attacker was, got him to confess via email, and convinced the attacker to return something around $30k in stolen funds (half of what was lost in that theft). Although I don't think any of those funds have been returned at this point.
We don't have any evidence for who took money at the previous hacks (or "hacks").

Well the depth between $11.80 and $12 was $350k, clearly.
To buy another $350k for example, you'd move the price about $1.10 -- far more than $0.20.
To sell $350k worth you'd move the price by about $1.20.
So you can see that a $0.20 movement is small relative to a $350k order in this market.

Thanks for asking this :)
GLBSE bonds and shares in mining companies are very different from Ferroh mining contracts.
- ***Buying a Ferroh 1GH/s mining contract is essentially the same thing as buying a 1GH/s mining rig*** (that has no downtime, no stales, and no variance).
- The amount of bitcoins you get from a 1GH/s mining contract at Ferroh depends only on the network mining difficulty, and nothing else.
The only unknowns when you buy a contract are what the mining difficulty will do in the future, and what the price of a contract will be in the future. And you may not even care about the future price of a contract unless you are interested in buying contracts low and selling them high (or selling them high and then buying them low).
GLBSE shares in a mining company on the other hand, perform according to how well that particular mining company performs. This varies from company to company.
- Ferroh contracts are fixed duration contracts that expire after a few months, and new identical contracts are issued again every 3 months.
- This type of standardization doesn't really exist in GLBSE, where things are a mishmash of all sorts of different stuff from many different issuers.
The only requirement to issue a bond/stock at GLBSE by the way, is to pay GLBSE $80. ferroh.com has been around for over a year now (though I've been around for longer as kdoto AKA Kris Olhovsky), and we've offered several services along the way. So you may prefer to trust Ferroh over some GLBSE issuers.
- The Ferroh mining contract marketplace allows you to sell mining power without any upfront cost to list mining power, but guarantees sellers that you cannot break the rules, by requiring you to put 50% of the contract sell price in escrow with Ferroh (where you are paid interest on your held funds) until your contract obligations end.
Ferroh mining contracts can be attractive to new bitcoin users since:
- You have the option to spend some US dollars on a contract, and bitcoins will trickle into your account over the term of the contract.
The idea here is to create a larger market for sellers, and an attractive option for new bitcoin users to get into the bitcoin game -- essentially providing them with the ability to get bitcoins over time with mining, instead of just throwing some money into MtGox and buying at a random time. Their USD will still flow into bitcoin exchanges, but they will (I hope!) be protected from sharp price deviations in bitcoin trade prices, and get bitcoins below the market rate.
And finally:
- Ferroh stores almost all bitcoins in cold storage, and automates much of the cold storage retrieval process through the withdrawal management system. [You can see your side of that here.](
So your coins are safe, even if the site is hacked.

Every 10 minutes 50 bitcoins* are given to all the miners worldwide.
As a miner, you get a portion of these coins based on how much computational power you have.


Like mining gold, mining coins costs considerable resources. Not all gold mining operations pay off. Some bitcoin miners have spent more on the costs of mining (electricity and computing equipment) than they have gotten back in bitcoin returns.
Currently mining is undergoing a big change -- specialized hardware referred to as *ASICs* that start at $150, up to tens of thousands of dollars each can mine highly efficiently. They are expected to ship in the next month or so.
I do not recommend that you start mining coins unless you want to buy ASICs. If you want to play with bitcoin, buy a few coins.
*Every 4 years half as many coins are released every 10 minutes. Soon the reward will be 25 coins per 10 minutes, and 4 years after that it will be 12.5 coins per 10 minutes and so on.

And those people are wrong.
He needs to spend $400k worth of coins just to move the price to $9.10, and everyone else doesn't need to spend anything to take advantage of any panic sell off that ensues.
There will probably be some selling due to a sudden drop like that, but even if he could take advantage of that in the short run, destabilizing the price and hurting investor confidence will just hurt him badly in the long run -- he has $2 - $4 million to sell, and has to think about when he is going to sell all of that.
The argument that investors will panic sell is just as well an argument against *not* selling off a ton of coins. He would be better off boosting their confidence in the $10 price, and only selling when the price spikes.

No, it doesn't, because tanking the price will eliminate market depth.
Just because you sell a bunch of coins, doesn't mean you can buy them back at a lower price. If it did, then everyone in every market would do this.
This is like the 10th time I've explained this in the last 24 hours so I'm pretty exhausted. Maybe I should go make a self post about it.
If he tanks the price, and there is next to no market ask depth, he can't buy back at the price he needs to pay that BTC out to his clients!

As you can see by the comment vote counts (if you have RES), apparently the misconception that the chain takes a long time to *download* and not a long time to actually be *verified* persists.
That's right, 0.8 does not magically increase your network download speed, but chain syncs that take many people 24 hours to complete currently now only take a fraction of that time in bitcoind 0.8.
This is because the database backend that bitcoind 0.7 uses (Berkeley DB) is inefficient, and is bottlenecked by the speed of your hard drive.
0.8 uses a new database backend (Level DB), and also implements ultraprune. Both of these greatly increase chain sync speed, and therefore greatly reduce the time it takes for an initial database sync.
Edit: Here are a few comments I've made about this in in the not very distant past:
@_date: 2012-08-20 22:21:22
Whether pirate sells the coins, or his clients sell those coins, is irrelevant.
You still can't expect to tank the price and then buy back and *double* your money, because the ask depth won't be there, regardless of how you put it.
Think about the process for how pirate would tank the price -- if he incrementally pays out clients, and those clients sell, why is it any better than pirate selling the coins himself? Especially since there is no reason to think that 100% of clients would sell 100% of their coins. I wouldn't.
The only way is if people *not* involved in pirate's scam panic and sell large amounts. Pirate betting on that outcome is foolish, because doing so is accepting the more probable outcome that he doesn't succeed. If he is willing to accept that possible outcome, why not just maximize profits by taking the money and running, and then by selling slowly over time.

I think what Falkvinge may have meant by destroying legacy banking, was really to destroy the *way* in which banking is conducted -- ***not*** to destroy banking altogether.
That said, whenever I see someone in the bitcoin community yell "banks are evil", or even worse "lending is evil", or even worse "Bitcoin Savings and Trust is fine", I let out a little sigh and just move on.
People forget that even Satoshi called for bitcoin banks -- eventually.
To have lending, big trusted institutions work. If Bitcoin really takes off, GLBSE could become pretty big (if the owners are capable of scaling it legally) -- that would be a bitcoin institution guys.
Then again, lending is possible without a big institution too, and maybe that is even better than banks doing it. That doesn't really have much to do with bitcoin though -- ***ivantheok is right; Bitcoin is not designed to be a replacement for banking, it is a replacement for currency***.

Offline wallets are great for savings, but unnecessary for your spending coins.
The coins would not have been stolen if he was using a Yubikey or Google authenticator.
MtGox is secure enough for this, and so is blockchain.info. The theft today was almost certainly due to keylogging, which could have easily been avoided without an offline wallet.
If you are not going to spend most of the funds, an offline wallet is a good idea -- but it is not required that you leave all of your coins there.

If you can generate keypairs, you can steal coins, and then bitcoin is broken.
What you have actually shown, is that that in that scenario, it is fixable by implementing a new keypair algorithm.


Which choice represents them "doing their job well" is what this discussion is about. Obviously everyone wants them to do their job well, and that statement is not about discussing cryptography, it is about winning an argument.


It is no more artificial than adding a second keypair algorithm to allow old pairs to be mined.
You could say that 50 years is arbitrary, but at least we'd know in advance when coins are going to become available, and we'd have a guarantee that their introduction back into the economy would be gradual (50 BTC maximum per block perhaps) -- predetermined supply is a cornerstone of the bitcoin philosophy. *In your method, it's extremely hard (or impossible) to predict when a very old address containing hundreds of thousands of coins will suddenly be unlocked.*
The reason, as I have already pointed out, is that there would be a huge shift in computation power toward mining old addresses, with no benefit to the bitcoin network (unlike current mining, which helps secure the chain).
I could also claim that "cryptography is messy" to support any choice of protocol change I wanted, I suppose :)
In the end, both dual keypair algorithms to secure new addresses, *and* demurrage (to avoid spending computation power on mining that hurts the network) might be implemented as a complete solution. Or maybe something else that we're not thinking of.

Well, since you would have bought a butterfly labs unit, here is a tutorial created by some user:
It is relatively easy. Plug it in to your computer and the wall socket, create an account at a mining pool, enter the account details into a piece of software on your computer.
That's it. You will probably want to check in on butterfly labs and other vendors once in a while, to see if they have a hardware upgrade available for you a couple of years down the road.
I don't recommend that you do that though. Wait and make sure that these units are available. The price of them may possibly drop too. If you order now, you're going to get them a couple of months behind everyone that ordered back in July -- that's pretty risky IMO. If you want to order right now, then order one 60GH/s model with your inheritance, set it up and get a feel for how everything works. Then you can make a more informed decision once you know that units are shipping.

I think that pairing Bitcoin with *other* revolutionary technologies that also share a vision and belief in global change is a good strategy for introducing Bitcoin to people.
I think that people will "get it" and accept it more easily when you introduce it this way. Instead of a "lol scam", reaction (because you seem like you are selling internet certificates), they might have more of a "wow big new tech" because you are "selling" the belief in a better way to do things.
TLDR; Introducing people to multiple world changing ideas together instead of only Bitcoin makes it easier for people to accept and understand what Bitcoin is.

If you pick a random phrase from a publication, and use a common brain wallet method, then I ***guarantee that your coins will be stolen***  at some point.
I cannot emphasize this enough.
There is a good reason why electrum stopped allowing users to pick their own brain wallet phrase -- it is because it is extremely difficult to make users choose a secure phrase.
Even if you took a random phrase and then added some random punctuation, you are still at risk. Your brainwallet passphrase has to include some significant randomness -- picking any actual english phrase from a publication guarantees that your phrase can be dictionary attacked easily.
Googling for a passphrase proves absolutely nothing, as even a combination of random words can and will be dictionary attacked.
You need a phrase plus random punctuation and/or intentional misspelling.

These days it's quite easy:
- If you have bitcoin savings, put them on an offline wallet. That means printed keys, and coins stored in a file that was created on a computer that has never accessed the internet before. A USB key with the file and a printout of the keys go in a lockbox. A copy of that USB key and printout go somewhere else safe.
- Coins that you want to spend go in blockchain.info or MtGox. Use a Yubikey with MtGox or a Google authenticator with blockchain.info.

Er, to be clear though, I am not saying this happens due to dollar money supply inflation.
I am saying that in order for a bitcoin to be worth $100000000, a very large amount of dollars would have been sold for bitcoins, devaluing the dollar.

Sales tax, property tax, etc.
You can still be taxed arbitrarily and then given whatever compensation from the government out of that tax.
Bitcoin makes it easier to avoid income tax because it is cash like -- but only if your income is not coming from a source that is reporting it. If your job pays you in cash, they are still reporting to the government the amount that they are paying you.

Well, other parts are wrong, but that part of his post is probably true.
In the short term (next 10 years), higher market cap means higher price per coin, which means higher returns on mining, which means more spent on mining.
In the long term, a higher market cap very likely means more people using bitcoin, which means more people paying transaction fees, which means higher mining profit, which implies more money spent on mining.

A password like that for lastpass is totally unnecessary.
The only time that bruteforce is a concern is if the lastpass database is compromised, at which point you can just change your password. Even in that case, a 20 character password will buy you a *LOT* of time (many years).
If there is no database compromise, then your password cannot be bruteforced, even if it is very short, because very few attempts at your password can be made remotely.


No, it is as secure as lastpass is. The strength of your chosen password has very little to do with it, as long as you pick something that is 14 chars or more, then the security vulnerability of the lastpass service itself is the only real concern.

The value of bitcoin arguably does increase, but does it increase from $5 to $8.50 due to one more vendor offering one more product? Now consider that this one more product, is a 100% bitcoin related product.
How much value does it add to have a product that you can use bitcoins to buy, when the product only serves to help Bitcoin?


Of course it makes a difference, it makes all the difference.
If $100k of bitcoins are bought today, and then those same $100k of bitcoins are sold tomorrow, we're close to back where we started (in fact the price has declined by the MtGox or other exchange fees).
You could argue that the price increase today could cause more people to buy -- but the price fall tomorrow could cause more people to sell just as easily.
The point is that this theory does not do a good job of explaining the price rise at all. Also, it ignores the other painfully obvious in-your-face evidence: There is someone with a 70k bitcoin order on MtGox. That is a big player buying a lot of coins, (and it's not likely he would do so to purchase BFL, as a purchase that large would be privately arranged with BFL).

2. My point was that it takes more than 2 hours, so I guess you're agreeing with me. Having 100mbit doesn't mean you can download at 100mbit -- the clients at the other end have to upload to you at 100mbit. The reason most people are network bound though, is because they do not have insanely fast networks like that anyway. You will likely be CPU bound before HDD bound on this client though, unlike the old (&lt; 0.7) clients.

I'm confused, you think that BFL is real, but you don't want to spend $150 on a Jalapeno that claims to do 3.5Gh/s on around 3w of power?
(That's 3500000 KH/s.)
Also you'd be consuming more of the pool operators resources than you'd be getting in bitcoins (almost zero) at that 50KH/s rate.


You would get nowhere near 800GH/s, and it would be pretty amazing if no one asked any questions about you consuming an entire cluster for some random project.
@_date: 2012-10-05 12:52:26


If you had one in your hands right now, technically yes.
In reality BFL will have a bunch of these running before they ship, increasing the difficulty. Then a ton of these devices will be in the hands of others before you, raising the difficulty again.
Also, the block reward will be cut in half sometime in November, so likely before anyone has one of these units. This of course doubles the time it takes to see a return on investment.


There has been no large sudden difficulty increase. I doubt they have one running (or if they do, then few are running).
When they are in full swing production, expect to see difficult rapidly increase to at least 5x the current difficulty in a matter of weeks.
Considering that there are multiple ASIC offerings out there now, who knows how high the difficulty could go up over the next 6 months. A 30x difficulty increase for example is not out of the question if we have multiple firms running lots of this hardware in-house. It depends on how much it costs these firms to produce 1GH/s of mining power.

You want to send Lollerskate Labs some coins, but you don't completely trust Lollerskate Labs (LL).
So you and LL agree to lock your funds in such a way that you and LL both have a password to the funds, and the funds can only be accessed if someone has both of these passwords.
So now the funds are locked and you have half of the passwords needed to get the funds, and LL has half of the passwords needed to get the funds.
- If Lollerskate Labs delivers the product you paid for, then you give them the password and they get the funds.
- If you do not give them the password, and they do not give you their password, then no one can get the funds.
- If Lollerskate Labs cannot deliver, they can choose to give you the password and allow you to get the funds back.
This is slightly better than just giving your funds to Lollerskate Labs outright, since then they could just walk away with your money without penalty.
Notice that this doesn't guarantee anything by itself, but it reduces the incentive to scam, and is a nice complement to a circle of trust rating system. Imagine eBay rating system plus this 2 party fund locking mechanism -- the seller has incentive to deliver (or else they gain no funds and lose rating), and the buyer has incentive to release funds to the seller (or else they will lose rating and lose their funds).
It is also possible for Lollerskate Labs to put some amount of coins into a separate fund locker, so that they stand to lose something as well as the buyer.

Actually that's a perfect example. (And I have used that code in my own games.)
[That code]( was not written by Carmack. It was not Carmack's idea. It did not originate at ID software. It was not created by the guy who wrote the code for ID software. It had been written many times in that industry before ID software's Quake code made it famous. And yet, it is somehow attributed to Carmack (or was for some years).
Wouldn't it be a shame if socrates1024 got all the credit for merkle trees by creating a reference implementation in python, when really the idea of a merkle tree stretches back to the computer scientists who developed the data structure, and those programmers who have already implemented this data structure elsewhere?
I think it's a shame that Carmack gets the credit for stuff like the fast inverse sqrt approximation, when really it had nothing to do with him.
My main point really was: Don't create sensationalist titles, I guess :)
To answer your question about why someone hadn't created it earlier, well, that's a tough question. I'll try to answer anyway.
I think mainly, the answer is: because it's hard. And because it's not clear that creating a reference implementation is going to gain you anything.
I'm not saying it's easy, I'm just saying that the title is a little over the top. After all, creating a reference implementation is a far cry from finishing the product.
When I was in 1st year of university I created a reference python implementation of the 2D CDF wavelet transform, you can see it here:
That reference implementation did not exist before I wrote it (in open source, to my knowledge), and it is still the only implementation linked from wikipedia. It was somewhat tough to figure out, but on the other hand I don't exactly deserve a medal either -- after all, I just developed it from the whitepapers that other clever computer scientists wrote.
Now, going from that to a working mpeg4 encoder/decoder is a really big step, and I'm never going to do that -- many people could see in advance that they werent going to do that next step, so maybe wouldn't have done the first step? I'm just guessing.

Well, lost coins may be a big problem for bitcoin if ECDSA gets broken, because large amounts of coins may suddenly be released into the system.
But okay, lets assume ECDSA never breaks (i.e. there are never quantum computers).
I'm not sure if the creator of freicoin says what you say he does, but I don't think it's important.
The ***key feature*** of freicoin is that 4.4% of your coins are distributed to every other freicoin user each year. This is not just demurrage.
To me, this seeks to encourage lending of coins. If you wish to keep the value of your coins, and you have more coins than anyone else, then you must lend your coins out at around a 4.4% interest rate. If you have fewer coins than everyone else, then you lend out your coins at a lower rate than this (since you will gain coins from everyone else each year).
Of course, you don't have to do the lending yourself, your bank can just pay you interest.
I'm not saying it should replace bitcoin, but it is an interesting idea, and might solve the hoarding problem -- if that is a problem.
The point of freicoin is not to solve some demurrage problem, it is trying to reduce the reward to early adopters, making room for late adopters. It is also trying to solve possible hoarding issues, by encouraging everyone to lend their coins out, or spend them.

Saving everyone time:
Deflation in this context means the price of goods relative to the price of a bitcoin are going down.
It does not refer to deflation of the money supply.
The argument that deflation causes hoarding is one that applies to currencies with a deflationary money supply (the other kind of deflation), and this lead to a shit storm of comments below.

The bottleneck is not HDD bandwidth, it is HDD read/write OPs/sec rate.


It is BerkeleyDB's fault, not bitcoind's. This is why bitcoind has switched to Level DB in 0.8, and the chain sync bottleneck is now network speed for most people. If you can download a 4GB torrent in 2 hours, then expect the chain to sync in 2 hours with bitcoind 0.8. If you have an average HDD, with the same network speed expect the chain to sync in 20 hours with bitcoind 0.7.


If you want to test how long it takes you to do the full check that bitcoind does at startup, you can move away the blk000?.dat files, and then start bitcoin-qt with "-loadblock=/path/to/blk0001.dat -loadblock=/path/to/blk0002.dat".
This will check the already downloaded chain from scratch. If you have an HDD (and not an SSD), expect it to take around 20-40 hours.
If you don't want to test yourself, and you still don't believe me (somehow), you can join  on freenode and ask the devs yourself.

Understandable. At least in 0.8 the client is now network bound for most people.

I don't think he says that we should do away with politicians altogether, just that we should consider/understand world changing forces. He also argues that engineers change the world faster (and more) than politicians do.
I personally think that politics can change the world greatly, consider democracy. That certainly changed the world. On the other hand it was a very slow process, and democracy today is not really as democratic as it could be -- another big point that Olesen makes.
I think that if people understand what Seasteading is, they can support it, and Seasteading will have an opportunity to change the world faster.
If think that if people understand what Bitcoin is (or IMO more importantly, what it *will* be soon), they can support it, and Bitcoin will have an opportunity to change the world faster.
The same goes for 3D printing.
TLDR; We should still have politics (we would have politicians of some type on seasteads). We should recognize and embrace the technologies that are going to change the world -- three of these are Seasteading, Bitcoin and 3D printing.

You missed a key part, which is that all of the bitcoins that are spent on BFL products are ***SOLD*** for USD, and that USD is given to BFL.
So yes, any bitcoins spent via bit-pay moves the price down (in the short term), since it is essentially the same as selling your bitcoins.
Remember that I am contesting the argument that the recent short term rise in price has anything to do with purchasing BFL products via bit-pay. Using Bitcoin for commerce in general does of course have the potential to raise the price in the long term, due to increased adoption of the technology.

No, the fees will be mostly determined by what people are willing to pay. Bitcoin has more of a free market in fees so I expect the fees to be lower than the current traditional system.
One difficult to predict factor here is how important it will be to pay the miners more to reach a higher level of security. I doubt that will be the main factor though.
@_date: 2012-09-14 11:36:46
That is why prediction markets where betting on the date of a persons death were proposed.
At such a site, you do not buy a hitman, you simply set a bounty on someone's head, which a successful anonymous better gets if they predict the date of death correctly (which they can easily do if they kill said person).
That said, I don't have time to watch the OP video, and I don't know which site they are referring to or how that site works.
Even if they have an eBay like site -- why is it easy for law enforcement to catch the hitman?
You put bitcoins in escrow, and they are released to the hitman when the kill is complete. You dont know who the hitman is, so how is he caught?

I thought that too until I got into some long arguments with people in (and &gt; All currencies are man-made. 
I meant as opposed to say, gold, which we discovered, rather than invented.
The definition is problematic IMO, since we assign value to gold just like we do to the dollar. That is beside the point though.
It turns out that you will find many people who consider bitcoin to be fiat, and they are not wrong -- many publications use an idea of "fiat" that doesn't require the fiat money to be backed by a government.
There is no point in arguing with people who think that liberty dollars are fiat, or bitcoin is fiat. It doesn't matter.
But yes, the modern common definition seems to be a money that is government backed. That said, and as I already pointed out earlier, bitcoin would fit the wikipedia definition of fiat if some country started using it primarily, regardless of whether it was government backed.

@_date: 2012-12-02 13:45:13


Yes. 
After you buy the coins at coinbase, coinbase now has your bitcoins. You can click "send" and send any amount of them to a different address. That address could be one that you own, that is held at a different wallet.
So for example you could create a blockchain.info account, and add a receiving address there. Then you could send your coins from coinbase to blockchain.info, if you want to.
You could also install the bitcoin client and send your funds from coinbase to your home bitcoin client address.
Where you store your funds is up to you.


There are many clients, and we sometimes call them "wallets" just to get the idea across that this is where you "store" your coins. (Technically, your coins are not stored there, your coins are stored on the network globally -- these clients just give you the ability to tell the network where to move your coins to.)
The only reason you really need a client that you download is so that you can control your coins without trusting anyone else at all. When you use coinbase, you are trusting them with your coins. When you use blockchain.info, you are trusting them a little bit too (although a lot less trust is needed with blockchain.info, which is why people will recommend that to you).


If you wish to be anonymous, I still recommend starting by buying coins from coinbase, and then using a mixing service like blockchain.info's anonymizer. It's tough to avoid giving some information to the bank when you first purchase coins. The only way around that is to purchase bitcoins from someone who is not a public entity (that is, not a company that is required to ask for that information from you). You could try localbitcoins.com to find someone near you with bitcoins for that.
I hope this helps get you started :) Keep asking questions.

- D3 gold is hyperinflationary (to put it mildly). The price of gold today is around $2.3 per million, but the price a couple of weeks ago was about $30 per million!
- At each patch (or at any time really), Blizzard can make changes that drastically change what the price of gold will be. For example, tomorrow (patch day) repair costs may be lowered, causing the gold supply rate to greatly increase, causing the price of gold to fall.
- Blizzard is in control of the D3 accounts that this gold is held on. Last week I had an account locked for no apparent reason, and I call Blizzard support every day, and haven't been able to get through yet. The gold on that account has fallen by half in the meantime.
So while your calculations are correct, they do not take into account the significant risks of buying the gold, the costs of buying D3 accounts and computers to store the gold, and the (so far) ever decreasing price of the gold.
The price I am currently offering is probably actually a little high to be sustainable, as was pointed out here. We're going to try to keep it as high as possible for as long as possible -- I'm willing to see some losses in the short term while the project develops further.

I have a minor in economics and a major in computer science, if that (somehow) helps to convince you that I'm not just pulling stuff out of thin air.
6% ROI per week is extremely high and not sustainable for a long period of time.
Many large companies work hard to gain in a year what pirate claims to gain in less than 2 weeks.
As I have said elsewhere in this thread, there are some possibilities for how pirate might be able to attain such a high ROI (for a short while) but the most likely case is that this is a ponzi.
There are so many reasons to think that it's a ponzi, even apart from the insanely high ROI. Here are a couple:
- At least $200k worth of coins are just sitting on the blockchain, and provably owned by pirate.
- He is willing to share almost no details about the operation other than that he has some investors.
- He has claimed to be moving the coins onto and off of the exchange, but there is no evidence of this (and there would be plenty if he was actually doing this with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of coins).
The best theory I've heard is that he could be selling coins to big investors outside of the exchange in order to provide them with the lowest possible price.

Edit: To be even more clear: If the clients got the BTC from pirate, then it is identical to pirate putting those asks in. This still doesn't manipulate the price such that he can double his money.
He needs low asks to buy coins to pay clients, and you say that he gets those low asks from clients that have already been paid their coins?
And why would clients that now feel relieved that they got their payout from pirate be in a rush to sell their BTC anyway? If pirate is paying out at high prices, then that is good news for the market (especially according to your theory).

I assume you want proof to support accusations that the site is a bucketshop?
Just ask the site owner if trades are supported by funds on hand, or if the service is a "contract for difference" service.
He will tell you it is "contract for difference" (he already openly admits this -- it is not a secret), which in this case is basically the same thing as a bucket shop. It would be a little different if perhaps he provided low margin leverage and mostly hedged positions.
However, he provides very high margin leverage, and does not hedge anywhere near the amount of margin "lending" he provides.
In other words, you can just ask the owner, to discover that this service is essentially the same thing as bitcoinica (not to mention that he is just using the bitcoinica source code).
The problem if you're still not sure, is that he does not have the funds that he lends to users. So instead, he sets up contracts between users. This is a big problem if there are more users that want to buy than want to sell (or vice versa). This problem became more clear to many traders when bitcoinica could not raise their price to match the MtGox price, causing anyone who sold during that time to lose money, since the bitcoinica price would immediately rise when it had sellers to match buyers against.
It also creates a big incentive for bitfinex/bitcoinica to move the market price against you, since they can allow you to place your 10:1 short margin position, and then move the price on MtGox themselves by 8% (by buying some coins on MtGox), and erase your entire position, keeping all your money. And neither you or me would be able to tell if they did that or not.

Replacing the current network power with BFL's ASICs (assuming they deliver and have accurately predicted specs) are already at 10x the power efficiency of current hardware on the network (if current hardware is average 2 MH/s/J).
BFL's ASICs are only 65nm.
Latest gen fabrication tech is 22nm though, which are far more power efficient.
A much more accurate cost assuming 22nm ASICs, in terms of electricity per transaction, is more like 0.1% per transaction in electricity (or less). (The bigger cost might be equipment capital though.)


It almost certainly is not -- the upper bound on bank costs is the fees they set, which are obviously way lower than 10%. Debit card fees in canada at big retailers are *well* under 1%.

Using your model, you have 187 watts of power to run a card, so if you could use every single one of those watts perfectly with a 58xx card (at 2MH/s per watt), then you make 20 bitcoins over one year if nothing changes.
That is a net *loss* of 23% annually.
If you do the same calculation with a single 7970 card though (or an FPGA), then you have a profit. So it's possible that the vast majority of 58xx miners already turned off.


Because difficulty has almost tripled since then, combined with the reward halving, means getting 1/6th as many coins per hash. The price has quadrupled, but that still means you are getting around 4/6ths, (2/3rds) as many dollars per hash now compared to when the price was $2.

If they have *anything* ready, they could boost their sales by showing us that they are actually getting ready to meet their manufacturing deadline. Whether that be PCBs, or the coffee warmer case, or the case of one of the other units.
I guess it could be that they aren't having *anything* manufactured until they get the chips back. If that's the case, then I wonder if they can possibly manage to get everything shipped by "early october" which is what they last predicted in the forum (though official ship date is Oct. 22 still).

Um, no it wouldn't mean that.
There are already multiple clients, and you can toss bitcoind in the garbage and continue on with bitcoin if you want to.
Bitcoind is a work in progress (also known as the satoshi client), and if it doesn't progress enough then we have completely new clients that rely absolutely not at all on bitcoind.
Bitcoin is a protocol only. Like the web is a protocol. You can view a website with Chrome or Firefox or Opera, and the website still looks the same because all of these different pieces of software follow the same web protocol.
If you prefer, you could think back to how terrible the very first BitTorrent client was. (And the second and third ones for that matter.) Now we have Transmission and uTorrent which are far better. They don't rely on the original BitTorrent client because they are all just following the BitTorrent protocol.
If Google wanted to build brand new bitcoin software for every part of the bitcoin ecosystem, they could start doing this today. There is no bitcoin reboot necessary for that.

There are probably cases* where a buyer would gain from hurting the seller, even if they lose the locked funds -- especially since the buyer gets the product they paid for first.
You definitely want to use this in an environment where there is a rating system or something else to encourage the buyer to release funds.
* Example case: You want to buy ASICs. So you buy lots of ASICs and then do not release funds. You now have the ASICs, and hurt the ASIC provider, which may delay their orders to other users or reduce the number of orders they sell (if they decide to stop using this fund locking as a result), which helps you, since the fewer ASICs out there, the better your mining return.

He currently has at least $200k (it has been proved that he has $200k just sitting there on the blockchain).
So if you ignore the fact that the coins are just sitting there, doing nothing, then you have this problem:
If he has $200k, and he can do 33x per year (more really, since he needs to pay himself too), then that means he has to be able to sustain at least 6.6 million after a year (not impossible, I guess).
More likely he has over $500k, and that means 16.5 million in transactions after 1 year (also not impossible, but still pretty unlikely IMO).

If they sell for bitcoins then they wouldn't have to launder as much in the first place (provided that they spend the coins rather than try to convert them into another currency).

Those computers likely aren't good for mining. Even if they are "good" (i.e. have high end AMD GPUs) then you are still going to make a small amount of coins, pay a higher electricity bill, and wear down the machine.

Maybe. You now have to buy specialized equipment for mining, rather than go to your local computer store and buy a GPU (or use one that you already have).
So some people will be able to mine more coins, and others who do not wish to invest in mining specific ASICs will mine less.

If pirate wants to cash out, he'll do it slowly and anonymously over time. That doesn't mean he isn't trying to crash the price, but I think it's more likely that everyone is simply panicking in response to the news of the ponzi closing.

On a good USB key new blocks might verify a little faster. I've seen people come to wondering why it is taking ***days*** for their blockchain to verify for the first time on their USB key.
A better solution is just to get an SSD (or wait for an SPV client to arrive).

My argument was about a 100% discount on electricity (free electricity).


This doesn't mean you will break even. You are buying equipment at a higher price than many miners are able to, so you have a significant disadvantage here, even if your electricity is free. Your electricity is not free so it's even worse than this.

Historically over the past year, even with 100% free electricity you would not have made a profit by buying any of mining equipment offerings out there.
So there's one data point for you.
The thing is, I was replying to a comment that assumed that "he will break even and get free heat" which is not true. OP *may* break even and get discounted heat, and OP should know that there's a significant risk that he will not break even, at least, don't you think so?
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:59:58
Even then your program doesn't increase the chance of breaking even.
Edit: I don't understand the downvotes. Using a program to turn your miner off periodically doesn't help improve the chances of turning a profit. Max profit is at 100% miner uptime.

We don't know if he will, if mining difficulty rises fast enough then he will take a loss, making this worse than just buying an electric space heater.


No he won't. Even if he's profitable now mining returns will eventually fall below electricity cost at which point he is paying for heat, and paying more than his gas heat alternative. It's only "free" if mining diff stays low enough for long enough, such that his miner generates as much as he spent on electricity up to the point that he pays for the miner ***plus*** he needs to pay for the difference in cost between electric heating and his gas heating alternative.
In my opinion he is likely to lose money by doing this.

Not running it means not generating coins which just further increases the likelyhood of not breaking even overall. Once the miner costs more in electricity than it generates in coins then your program would run the miner never anyway. In fact it would stop running even before that, as gas heat is cheaper than electricity.

An appropriately chosen size (at every point in time) would not limit growth.

There's nothing in the bitcoin code that enforces a rule like "if I can't download this block in 10 minutes then just discard it".
(Well, except for the block size limit which does this indirectly.)
If you had big enough blocks, all of which for many people take more than 10 minutes to download, then many people would not ever be able to verify the chain.
Even right now, if you use your bitcoin node on a connection that can't download more than 1mb/10 minutes then you will never be able to verify the chain.

Just like bruteforcing a password is hard and having the correct password is easy to verify.
It might not be needed to guarantee that the task is not too hard. If a node gives you a task that is too hard (which you can prove by trying all the possibilities in the space that the node claims the password is in) then you just stop trusting that node and don't try to solve any of his results anymore. The node doesn't want you to do this so he wouldn't even bother lying about the password difficulty anyway.

To have a transaction that gets confirmed, the network has to choose to mine it. Typically in a full network this means it needs a fee.
What is the minimum fee that we should pay? What happens when that fee is not enough?
You see, it is not about having transactions that don't confirm, it is about having the *option* to have these transactions -- allowing the network to define when a transaction does or does not get confirmed instead of trying to do this top-down approach of defining and redefining which transactions those should be at the protocol level.

Yes, but it is majorly flawed in that you can't contact a user in any way once a trade is closed unless they reopen a trade with you. They probably don't have an ad listed so you can't even open a trade with them to talk.
There have been several cases of someone opening a trade, then closing it after 5 minutes because they got impatient. I try to message them on minute 6 and I can't. On localbitcoins for example, that trade would probably still proceed successfully.

You do not "hash all [the transactions] until they get the right result" as you said.
There is no significant slowdown for adding transactions.
If there was, all the blocks would be empty right now because miners would prefer faster block finding.
Also, block propagation causing slowdowns is why we have "[headers first]( now, so there is not even a slowdown for adding transactions due to block propagation time.
Bottom line: No, adding more transactions doesn't slow you down as a malicious miner trying to create a gigantic block, and no you don't need the block to propagate within 10 minutes either.

You seem to ignore that larger and larger waves of new people are coming into bitcoin, eclipsing the old ones that have learned not to be so easily scammed.
So if there are 10000 bitcoin users, 2000 of them are scammed, and then a year later 100000 bitcoin users join, and 20000 of them are scammed, it might seem to you that users "never learn", but actually the original 2000 that were scammed did learn.
It will take a long while before everyone learns (because there are so many potential new users), but eventually there are relatively few new users (as a percentage of total userbase) each year, and you won't feel this way anymore.

It's actually a simple question, with a complex answer.

Cryptsy is a bitcoin exchange. Bitstamp, btc-e, bitfinex, OKcoin, Huobi,... all compete with it.
Circle competes more with Coinbase.
Mycelium competes mostly with localbitcoins.


I have clients that ask me to bypass the mycelium local trader feature to avoid the fee.
The fee is therefore too large, as some people would rather do a direct transfer than use the service that they provide.
Their fee is also not low enough to provide enough incentive for users to move from localbitcoins to mycelium (1% to 0.4%).


I'm willing to pay, too bad I'm not their one and only income source. Anyway, that's not how pricing works obviously, and I sense that you are being a dick so I'll let you reflect on how they might choose their fees or how they might differently charge users rather than write an essay about it here.
Also note that if they grew to be a fraction as large as localbitcoins, 0.4% is millions of dollars per year. They don't need that much to support the app in its current form.

The creator of Bitcoinica created [CoinJar, discussed on the front page]( of this sub.
Bitcoinica is an exchange that was "hacked" and stole about $1 million(?) worth of coins (at the time valued at about $8/coin), so worth an awful lot more today. Please correct me if those numbers are off. There was so much drama surrounding this "exchange" (it started as a CFD bucket shop actually, with virtually no hedging or connection to the actual market) that I can't recall precisely who stole what amounts.
It was hacked several times shortly after Zhou Tong sold the exchange to new owners, though he was still working on the exchange with them.
In one hacking incident Zhou Tong was able to contact the thief and negotiate an agreement to get 20000 of the coins back all within about **1 hour**. Amazing luck and negotiating skills, or far more likely Zhou Tong was the thief. Here's the thread, if you want to go down that rabbit hole:

No, it is exactly a 2x increase in mining speed (1 block every 5 minutes) if you schedule computation increases optimally.
Diff adjusts, then you double computation power. Now you mine 1 block per 5 minutes (2x speed) for 1 week instead of 2 weeks. Then diff adjusts, now you double computation power, again you mine blocks at double rate for 1 week. Etc. In the end you have mined all blocks twice as fast you would have with a constant diff adjust.
In fact, if you continuously increased diff fast enough, you could mine all bitcoins this year (this isn't feasible in practice because of hardware limitations and other things of course).

He immediately went on to create a domain service after bitcoinica and now he is behind Coinjar.
I'm just saying that it's a real shame that he decided to steal this money, it was a really shortsighted move and it seems like he wants to provide useful services and is capable of doing that -- but he did so much damage to his reputation and I wonder if he'll ever recover from that.

I didn't say that.
I said:
"Mycelium competes *mostly* with localbitcoins."
Which is true. Cryptsy for example doesn't offer cash for bitcoins at all. Mycelium *only* offers cash for bitcoins. So these two services have a small amount of overlap, but offer totally different features so they are not direct competitors.


How is that in any way "clear". To me it is very clear that I do not believe this.
I want them to set a fee or change their model so that they are able to collect enough money to develop their app. The local trader part of their app is currently very weak, by the way (buggy, missing features,..).
The point is that they are making *less* money by charging the fee that they do than if they didn't charge a fee this high, or if they charged it differently.

Because it's easy to imagine how to do 1 TPS in a distributed way when it is *write-only*, but not perceived as useful to write about that because 1 TPS is generally not very useful. The only place that this is actually useful at the moment is with a cryptocurrency where a transaction is low bandwidth and still very useful (name one other place where you can use 1 TPS).


Satoshi's breakthrough is really not in the DB part of this system. A write-only DB that does 1 TPS by essentially bruteforce (just store a copy of every transaction everywhere!) is not that amazing and there are many university/college level students that could have produced this solution if you gave them a big enough carrot and asked them specifically for such a system.
Satoshi's real work is in tying together multiple concepts for the specific purpose of creating a cryptocurrency, bitcoin's virtually ironclad security even right at version 0.1, and actually getting this entire project complete and released in a useable form.

Currently 0.056 BTC per day are mined per GH/s.
So 60GH/s * 0.056 BTC/day = 3.36 BTC/day. Taking downtime, stales, pool fees, into account it's more like 3.2 BTC/day.
Expect difficulty to rise until a $2500 SC at 50GH/s looks unprofitable after 1 year of mining. (Because the SC will probably be more available than an Avalon, and because it is more energy efficient.)
Assume a price of $200/BTC.
Then you need to mine 12.5 BTC to pay off a $2500 SC.
Currently an SC pays for itself in 12.5/(50*0.056) = 4.4642 days.
1 year is about 365 days. So difficulty would rise 365/4.4642 = 81.76x higher than the current difficulty before people stop buying SCs.
At that point a BFL SC will produce 0.034 BTC per day, and an Avalon will produce 0.041 BTC per day, assuming 100% uptime, 0 stales, no pool fee.

Neither inflation or deflation is a problem in small amounts. Both have advantages and disadvantages.
Hyperin/deflation however can be very bad.

Here's my estimate of expected difficulty increase:
Assume difficulty will rise until a $2500 SC at 50GH/s looks unprofitable after 1 year of mining. (Because the SC will probably be more available than an Avalon, and because it is more energy efficient than an Avalon and more energy and cost efficient than a Jalapeno.)
Assume a price of $200/BTC.
Then you need to mine 12.5 BTC to pay off a $2500 SC.
Currently an SC pays for itself in 12.5/(50*0.056) = 4.4642 days.
1 year is about 365 days. So difficulty would rise 365/4.4642 = **81.76x higher than the current difficulty** before people stop ordering SCs.
At that point a BFL SC will produce 0.034 BTC per day, assuming 100% uptime, 0 stales, no pool fee.
I suspect difficulty will continue to rise anyway, as people will have already made orders and be committed even after the difficult has gone this high.
So I think that 81x difficulty increase is really a lower bound. If there is more cost effective equipment out there, or if someone starts making more cost effective equipment, then difficulty will certainly rise higher than that. How fast we get to that difficulty level depends largely on how fast BFL can ship these things.

Yes, but I think having it on MtGox will slow mainstream adoption. One of the big reasons I suspect the bitcoin community wants it there is because GPU miners can continue to mine profitably for a while longer.
Anyway, Bitcoin is also a value storage mechanism, and if you don't think so, Bitcoin still benefits from a price increase:
- The price will be more stable when the market cap is higher. 
- People take it more seriously when the market cap is higher/growing. 
- A higher market cap means that bitcoin can support larger value transfers. 
- A gain in holdings for those who bought bitcoins leads to further investment into bitcoin tech.

No, I'm picking this number so that every SI prefix that we already use still fits into this system.
This makes everything simpler and makes things scale beyond satoshis.
We have 1000 units = 1000 smaller units = 1000 even smaller units, which is simple.
With satoshis, we have 100 units = 1000 smaller units = 1000 even smaller units.
Using satoshis is what is arbitrary -- why do you have 100 units in there instead of keeping the symmetry of 1000 units everywhere?

I was going to say something like "lol even if it stays between $44.01 - $44.99 for a month that's not very stable!!" but actually, the price is high enough now that a $1 sized movement in a day represents only a 2% movement, which in many cases is on par with a big national currency daily movement.
I wonder if trader psychology at this high price point will actually lead to stability (traders feeling like a $1 movement is large, even though in terms of percentage-wise movement, it is much smaller than a $1 sized movement when the price was much lower).
TLDR: The high price of bitcoin might lead to stability, because of possibly common human perceptions of relative number sizes.

If you intend to lend to someone at 10% interest, and expected bitcoin deflation is 3%, then you offer that person 7% interest, which gives you a 10% yield anyway.
This is a problem of course when you want to offer 2% interest, but the point is that things might not be as bleak as you think (lending can still occur at rates above the deflation rate).
You might want to think about why anyone would buy an inflationary currency (inflation refers to money supply inflation in this context).
The only reason we use inflationary currencies today is because the government forces this to happen. A cryptocurrency doesn't have such a force, and even when it does, there will always be a cryptocurrency that doesn't have inflation.
If one inflationary cryptocurrency becomes widely accepted everywhere, then it would be easy to trade into/out of that currency from other cryptocurrencies, so value storage would still occur in the non-inflationary currency.
Basically what I'm telling you is that it doesn't matter if inflationary currencies are better in some sense, because a free market will ultimately not choose them for value storage.

You don't want to say $47 and then when people check the price after seeing this video the price is $45 and they say oh no, what's wrong, why is the price less than I expected? (What if you said $47 right before the crash a few days ago, and they check and see the price at $35!)
It's better if you say $40 and then when they check the price, the price is even higher than they expected. If the price crashed a bit, to $42 or something like that, then the price is still in the range they expected.

My "agenda" is that I want bars to accept bitcoins. I think the best path to this is to polish a payment processing service for bars (I don't care which one), and then present the polished solution to bars.
I think that it is a bad idea to bring a half-baked method to bars and hope that they figure out the tipping part.
I have no interest in starting a payment processing service myself, and I am not currently working or am affiliated with a payment processing service in any way, if that's what you were suggesting.


They could, and many people do, but *all* people do not.


BitPay and Coinbase and BIPS are in the business of providing a payment processor service.
I am giving them -- for free -- a problem and a solution. Whichever one of them implements easier tipping first will gain an edge over their competitor, and Bitcoin will be the better for it.

If deflation rate in the long term is 2% per year, and you wanted to charge 5% interest on a loan, then just charge 3% interest on the loan instead, and your bitcoins still increase in value by 5% per year.
It's the same situation as inflation of 2% per year increasing the rate of interest by the inflation rate.
Now, if you want to charge an interest rate that is below the deflation rate, then *that* is a problem. But the deflation rate is going to be very low eventually (~2% per year maybe) so this will only be a problem for the very lowest risk loans. It wouldn't really affect credit card lending in a very negative way, for example.

If someone is just starting they will have a much better experience by:
- Creating a coinbase account
- Buying from coinbase
- Making a blockchain.info wallet.
- Link google authenticator with their blockchain.info wallet.
- Moving their coins to blockchain.info
- Getting an Android or iPhone blockchain.info app
- Now you can let them know about the bitcoin reference client, which they can use if they want, and they won't come here freaking out when the blockchain takes days to sync.
- Now they can go to faucets, and whatever else.
Why are you starting them with the reference client? It is probably *less* secure than blockchain.info for the average beginner user.
Syncing the chain is also a horrible first experience that creates a lot of confusion, and sends a lot of people to the forums, reddit, IRC, asking what the hell is going on and why does bitcoin require days of syncing before you can use it?
Bitinstant is more expensive and harder to use than coinbase, if you are in the US.

There *is* difficulty for smaller units compared to a microbit. Did you actually read the SI symmetry arguments? The bitcointalk thread about microcoins as a base unit?
SI symmetry is not required, but it makes it easier to reason about the bitcoin unit while still having a smaller base unit.
What is the disadvantage of using microcoins as a base unit instead of a satoshi? It is easier to convert them to bitcoins than satoshis. Keeping bitcoins as a unit will ease the transition greatly. What do we gain by discarding bitcoins as a unit?
Why would people stop using bitcoin just because the price is high? *That* logic is flawed.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:29:55
It's easy to convert microcoins to bitcoins. It's hard to convert satoshis to bitcoins.
This solution is very similar to the "skip to satoshis" idea, but without the pitfalls.
We might need a better name and/or symbol than microcoins (the symbol is uB or uBTC).
This solution scales past satoshis, if we want smaller units than satoshis, and has a natural "cent", 0.01 microcoins = 1 satoshi. (In fact maybe that's exactly what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind here?)
This is the smallest unit past the decimal point that most people are comfortable with reasoning about.

Technically you're right, so I'm sorry that you're being so furiously downvoted.
That said, I think the community is downvoting you because the sentiment that transactions can't be reversed is basically correct. Roger Ver is trying to communicate to merchants that chargebacks dont happen in Bitcoin, which is hard to sell to merchants since basically every other digital payments system they've used has chargebacks, even the ones that claim not to have them (like online debit).
I think it's fair to say that "it's mathematically impossible for transactions to be reversed" is a false statement, and could be worded differently.
It is possible for double spends to be reversed, though your criticism wasn't delivered in a way that makes it easy for anyone to listen to you, so there are at least two parties here that need to work on their communication I guess :)

That's pretty irrelevant. The reason is simply that the price is at or beyond the profitability limit for most arbitragers that know how to do the arbitrage.
In other words:
- For most people it isn't worth it to capitalize on the current price difference (take risk and trade fees into account).
- BTC-e only recently started allowing US wires and therefore only recently opened its doors to a majority of US-based arbitragers. (Some arbitragers haven't added BTC-e into their arb routine yet.)

Bitcoin is essentially just a decentralized database, as is namecoin.
What makes you think it would be "bloated"? You pay for transactions on the namecoin chain (similar to how you pay for bitcoin transactions).
These transactions are not "bloat", they are the record of domain names that namecoin is designed to store. Bitcoin stores bitcoin transactions and currently is much larger than the namecoin blockchain.

Silk Road 2.0 could dramatically change the way that commerce is done in markets like these, and enable transactions on Craiglist that are currently difficult and risky.

I didn't say anything about it being good or bad, I was replying to someone who basically said that there was no such thing as monetary inflation.
That said, if the money supply inflates, but prices stay the same, then if the money supply did not inflate, then prices would have actually gone down.
In other words, *monetary inflation leads to a loss of your purchasing power*, compared to no monetary inflation, ceteris paribus. If prices are staying the same then you may be seeing for example, efficiency gains that would otherwise reduce the prices that you would pay, that you now do not get to take advantage of.

CPU speed will not bottleneck you.
Do you pay for electricity?
It will cost more money in electricity to mine with a 7970 than you get back in coins when the difficulty adjusts for ASICs. This could be as soon as two months from now.


It depends.
MH/s is meaningless by itself, so you are concerned with MH/s/J and MH/s/$.
The short answer is: Calculate what you will earn from the card. Calculate what the card costs to run. Assume that you will make 1/2 as much in a month, and 1/4 as much in two months. Decide if this is worth it to you.
You currently get 0.138 bitcoins per day per 1000 MH/s. So a 7970 stock does about 550 MH/s, therefore it gets 0.55 * 0.138 = 0.0759 bitcoins per day. At $29/coin, that's $2.20/day. It uses 180 watts roughly. At $0.13/kWh, it costs (180w/1000w) * 24hrs * $0.13 = $0.56/day to run.
So you make $1.34 per day with a 7970 at 550MH/s and $0.13/kWh.
When difficulty doubles (say, in a month), you'll be making ($2.20/2 - $0.56) = $0.54/day.
When difficulty is 3.93x higher (if the price is still $29 per coin) 7970 mining will cost more in electricity than you get back in coins.

No offense but you have a monstrous post where it seems like you could have stated your main point in a sentence :)
I think you are simply trying to say that "*if an outlet is rated at 15 amps, then you can run 1800 watts off it because derating has already occurred*". Right?
I have heard multiple electricians say otherwise, but let's say I take your word for it and you're right -- this still barely changes my answer to the OP, which is basically that he doesn't have enough power on a typical north american power outlet :P
That said, if he has a 20 amp circuit and you're right, then he has enough power (if he doesn't plug anything else in...).


A breaker connected to a 15 amp circuit won't break below 1800 watts but my understanding is that this doesn't mean you can safely continuously run 1799 watts all day. You can burn something out, whether it be the outlet or the wire if you run 1799 watts continuously in some cases.


Well no, it is running at 1100 watts -- you just said it is. That is clearly well below 15 amps at 120v, which is 1800 watts (15*120 = 1800).

My point was that if a mining device is priced at say 0.8 BTC when the BTC price is $100/BTC, then the device should still be priced at 0.8 BTC (*not* 0.72 BTC) when the BTC price is $90/BTC the next day.

It's impossible for Electrum to steal your money, though they could do some annoying things, e.g. their servers could go down, and you'd have to move your keys over to a different client that doesnt rely on their server.
- [Multibit]( also syncs fast (in a few minutes) because it is an SPV client. It doesn't need the whole chain.
- Also many will recommend [blockchain.info]( to you, because it is not like previous e-wallets, in the sense that it is difficult for them to steal your money, and you don't need to use blockchain.info to access your blockchain.info wallet. But it is still sort of an e-wallet, and they could probably steal some client funds before they got caught if they really wanted to close down shop.

That's correct. You can currently spend something like $50 million on ASICs and 51% attack.
That is about 1/4 the market cap of bitcoin.
As bitcoin grows, the amount it costs to 51% attack goes up.
Bitcoin users will also notice the 51% attack, and there are some options for rendering ASICs useless to defend against the attack -- like slightly modifying the hashing algorithm, and then reverting to GPU mining.
That would be a bad situation, and the only real defense against it is that it is really expensive and unrewarding.
When the bitcoin market cap is 100 times larger, the attack will probably cost something like 50 times more than it currently does.

It is tempting for Coinbase to respond to a user on reddit about an issue, but that gives users on reddit priority over other support tickets. If other redditors see this then more posts come to reddit to get priority replies.
Before long tons of support tickets are now on reddit, which a) creates the problem you describe in the OP, b) makes the support process less efficient.
Coinbase has received many thousands of new tickets in the last few days under enormous growth. This will calm down since new users have more questions than experienced users.

Buying insurance (life/house/health/car insurance etc.) reduces your expected future net worth, but does that mean they are useless services? They reduce the variance of your net worth by reducing your exposure to sudden massive expenses (like your car is stolen or your house burns down).
The chance of your house burning down is small, but it hurts you a ton if it happens, so you are willing to pay a small premium to avoid that scenario.
This is what DCA offers.
It is also why investors diversify, instead of putting all their money into one stock to maximize EV of return and ignore everything else.

Wow, no. 
I am not setting a price or interpreting value based on my opinion. I am talking about current market price and value as determined by the market. 
The denomination chosen for silver and bitcoins are both arbitrarily chosen and this determines the price per unit. 
If satoshi had decided to create only 2 million coins then we would have been at parity with the price of silver per ounce long ago (because the price per coin would be 10x greater). However the total value of all bitcoins would not be higher just because the price per unit is higher (since there are fewer units). 
You are completely missing the point. I apologize if that's because im not finding a better way to make it clear :/
I'm very much a supporter of Bitcoin (as anyone who frequents this subreddit knows) and I'm not trying to ruin the party here. That said, silver is worth $1350 billion (as determined by the *market*, not me) and bitcoin is worth $0.3 billion. 
Thus, they have equal values (market caps) when a bitcoin is priced at $64k and a silver ounce is priced at $30.
Parity is different depending on which denomination of silver, and of bitcoins you compare prices of. This doesn't affect the market caps of either. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:01:49
Pretty much everyone agrees that we should switch to a smaller unit.
The question is whether the arbitrary amount of 100 million satoshis = 1 bitcoin is a better base value than an established amount, like one millionth of a bitcoin (a microbit) as a base unit.
In my opinion, we should use uBTC (uB for short), called a microbit as the base unit.
The current price is about $0.60 for 1000 microbits.

That is not a requirement.
For each good added, the price of a bitcoin can be tied partly to that good. It is not a binary all-or-nothing thing.


There is ***already*** a [futures market for bitcoin]( It just isn't a very good one. I personally know a very capable developer who is working on a robust futures market project.
More robust exchanges are underway, yes. Look at project Buttercoin. MtGox has stated that their engine is being redesigned. A more robust exchange does not mean that you can instantly convert USD from anywhere to bitcoin -- that *would* be a more robust exchange, but that is not required to reduce volatility, and isn't what I'm talking about. By a "more robust exchange" I meant that denial of service attacks are far less likely to happen. There have been multiple occasions when exchange engine vulnerabilities have caused panic selling, and that is going away.
(The BitcoinATM might accomplish part of what you suggest though, of course there's no point in arguing about whether that will be a successful project.)


Again, you asked for an argument about the *likelyhood of this happening*. The fact that work is already being done, and the fact that MtGox has millions of dollars (more than the resources required to improve their engine) and have stated that they are improving their engine, points to a high likelyhood that their engine will improve.
I explicitly said that the market cap point cannot be argued to your satisfaction, and said in two separate comments that only 3/4 bullet points were addressed, so I don't know why you have multiple paragraphs dedicated to this point. If you don't think that the price will rise, then you also don't think that volatility will go down as a result of increased market cap. That's fine.


It will take years for the price to become stable, and by that time large upward movements will not be there to benefit you. I don't mind that you're skeptical and frankly, and it's fine if you don't agree with my argument. I'm not trying to convince you to buy bitcoins. However, I suggest that you at least do yourself a favor, and understand my reasoning before replying. It's clear that you didn't do that in this last comment, especially with regards to the market cap argument, where you seem to have completely ignored that I was excluding it for you.

This is just due to the low volatility of the Euro/USD compared to the BTC/USD right now. So to avoid having to adjust my prices multiple times per day, I can just price my apples in Euros (or USD) and accept payment in the equivalent amount of bitcoins at the time of sale.

If the operator of LR was directly and knowingly conducting money laundering then it shouldn't be surprising that they are shut down, and bitcoiners should not be concerned (though we don't know the exact details of this LR shutdown yet).

[Here is your chart without the smoothing line you are using, so you can see the full price movements.](
You picked the most stable price period bitcoin has ever seen except for maybe near inception.
And *still* there are highly volatile sections of that chart.
The price was relatively stable in your chart for slightly more than 2 months.
Other than that, it was extremely volatile.
You see the price go from $7 to $9.5 in a few days. A 35% rise. (Right now that would be similar to watching the price go from $95 to $70 in a week.)
You also see the price go from $6 to $4 in a week. A 50% decline.
There are also plenty of individual days in your chart where the price is very volatile.
There is one day where the low is $7.3 and the high is $9.5. A 30% difference.

Yes, and that's fine. The problem is that Litecoin is almost the same as Bitcoin. What innovation does Litecoin have that makes it so valuable?
The fact that litecoin is almost the same makes it harder to argue that Bitcoin's value is not threatened by many new altcoins being created.
If another cryptocurrency comes along that is significantly different, that's fine. Namecoin for example, sets itself apart from Bitcoin and can do something that Bitcoin cannot.

If you already have coins, then put them in Bitstamp. When price is higher on Bitstamp than MtGox, sell those coins on Bitstamp, buy equal amount immediately on MtGox.
If you don't already have coins, well, you should buy some with your MtGox USD anyway. Now you can do the above procedure.

The level of trust required is much lower.
If blockchain.info is hacked, you do not necessarily lose your bitcoins.
If coinbase was hacked on the other hand, their hotwallet would certainly be robbed immediately.
Coinbase could also walk away with your coins right now.
Blockchain.info cannot -- they would need to try to change their client side code and hope no one notices for long enough to steal users's passwords.
The reason for this is that blockchain.info does not have your private keys. Those are decrypted client side in javascript when you log in.

The cost of mining gold moves slowly, for the same reason that the cost of mining a bitcoin moves slowly -- it takes time to expand mining operations, and it is risky to expand mining operations because you don't know if the price of a bitcoin/(ounce of gold) is going to stay high enough for long enough to pay for your mining operation initial costs.

If you really believe that, then you can apply the exact same argument to Bitcoin, in which case there is no reason you should buy gold.
However it is not true. Most of the gold is already mined, so even if *all* gold mining operations shut down, we don't expect the price of gold to change very much due to a change in gold supply (because the supply can't change very much already).
In the longg term the price of gold might rise again, yes, but the same can be said of the price of a bitcoin.

When you turn on an ASIC, difficulty goes up at the next bi-weekly adjustment, and the amount of coins the ASIC (and all miners) receive from mining goes down a little.
If you got an ASIC *today*, it would pay for itself in a week or two, yes.
But you can't get one today. You can get one in a few months, after hundreds of other ASICs have been added to the network. At that point difficulty will be far higher than it is today, and the time to pay itself off is in the 1 year range (maybe more, maybe less, maybe it never pays for itself).

Not really. What *should* happen though is that a refund policy should be available that makes it explicitly clear what currency you will be refunded in.
Demanding that businesses must issue refunds in BTC is not a great idea though, since this would prevent a lot of businesses from accepting bitcoins in the first place.
If the business has prices set in BTC, that might be different. But if they have prices set in USD (or some other currency), expect the amount you get back to be based on the USD price.
Most people would happily ask for BTC refund from BFL at this point for example, if they could.

- It is bloatware. 
- It doesn't encrypt your data.
- It doesn't interface with any other method of editing your notes. You have to use evernote.
On my Android phone for example, using dropsync to sync a folder of text documents, plus a text file editor to create/edit the text files in the folder accomplishes what evernote tries to do in a more robust way. Now I can use any text editor on my desktop/laptop to edit the text files in my dropbox folder.
Dropbox doesn't encrypt your data either, but you can sub in a service that does (SpiderOak, Wuala, MEGA), though they don't quite have Android apps that beat DropBox yet (Wuala is getting there).
For encyption, you can use an encryption app in combination with this technique (like using TrueCrypt with dropbox on your desktop).
If you want to make quick notes that are displayable in widgets, and make lists and so on, try Google Keep. You can edit these notes in your Google Drive later. I still hate that your data is not encrypted though, so I while I do use Google Keep, it's not usable for anything sensitive.

Bitcoin started that way too (with effectively no transaction fee). Terracoin doesn't solve that problem in the long run. If Terracoin is wildly successful (somehow) then it faces the same transaction fee issues that Bitcoin does.


You get 6 confirms in 12 minutes (avg) with Terracoin, but you do not get the same level of security as you have with 60 minutes (6 confirms) of Bitcoin.
Like litecoin though, yes, it does give you the same level of security as 6 bitcoin blocks in less than 60 minutes (I believe it's something like 20-30 minutes but the math is difficult so I'm not certain -- several people have attempted the math, but the number I trust the most is based on simulation).

I have a wireless-ac network, an 8 core liquid cooled desktop,... It is still painfully slow. Have fun with this on a raspberry pi.
The XBMC player is useless, the picture quality is horrible. You can switch to an external player, but then you lose many features. Be careful not to click "play from here" in the middle of a collection, as you now will be stuck playing every item in the collection, closing your external player for each item until it is finished.

You will add wear and tear on the card.
I have had several 58xx series cards die on me while mining, in well ventilated cases in well ventilated conditions.
It will cost you some time to set up and maintain mining, especially when you have to turn mining off to play a game.
You will gain a very small amount of coins by mining on an nvidia card -- something like a few dollars worth of coins per month at the current difficulty (and you'll cost someone else something like a dozen dollars per month worth of electricity).

Want to give someone 0.001 bitcoins? That's 100K satoshis.

You got low/high backwards.
An increase in difficulty corresponds to a reduction in target size (so a more difficult to find hash), so maybe that's why you put it that way.


It seems like the network will just under/over compensate at each difficulty adjustment, but eventually block rate stabilizes at the target rate. It just wont reach that target rate as fast anymore, because the Bitcoin algorithm assumes that increasing difficulty produces linearly more difficult mining.

I assume by "ironing out bugs in bitcoin" he really meant "solving all the bitcoin problems that are major barriers to adoption". There are several of these, to name a few:
- Difficulty of bitcoin storage (we need hardware wallets to ease the use for non-techy people)
- Difficulty of bitcoin payments. I have yet to see QR code restaurant bills, with a separate QR code for the tip, for example. Paying with bitcoin at a restaurant currently involves an awkward process of scanning the server's phone/tablet and having to ask the server to enter the amount you want to tip before you pay.
- Scalability problems (7 transactions per second limit currently)
- Anonymity and fungibilty (being able to separate coins apart reduces both)

So a 17.4% increase for this sunday over the average, and a 122% increase for this saturday over the average.
Viewed that way, I would say the saturday increase is a lot, and it makes sense for it to be higher in light of recent events.
However, the sunday increase is small, and within the variance of the last 4 sundays.
I also don't think it makes that much sense to ignore the weekday trading completely -- yes trading on this saturday saw a big bump, but not to unprecendented trade levels in a 24 hour period or anything.
Also, this thread is about the past 24 hours apparently, which means Sunday, not Saturday.

One case I can imagine that one might want to use satoshidice for:
Suppose you have 59 BTC and there is a 75% off sale on a 240 BTC item.
The sale ends in an hour, and you need to get 1 BTC in order to buy the item for 60 BTC.
You have no way of getting 1 BTC in an hour (or it is a pain to do so).

Because by having bad spelling they only get responses from the most gullible people, so instead of having to wade through hundreds of thousands of responses from people that will ultimately not fall for the scam, they only have to reply to dozens of responses from people who are much more likely to be scammable.

A bubble is simply when the price is higher it should be, given the value of the asset.

If the price of a bitcoin rises to $2000 and then crashes to $300, then right now we would not have been in a bubble, as the current price would not be deemed an overvaluation by the market.

That was a positive sentiment... the author is suggesting that the ETF would improve Bitcoin.


By allowing purchase of a bitcoin backed asset via traditional financial channels.


This is the only one you might be half right about However the idea might be that 40% of all bitcoin exchanges have failed, and it is unlikely that this ETF would fail. Currently you can't easily withdraw USD from MtGox. Some people see that as a big risk. The ETF would not have such a problem.


Investment in the ETF in terms of ROI is similar to owning a bitcoin directly.


They are saying that the chances of the SEC proposal being approved is more likely, knowing that a successful lawyer with a good reputation put it together.


Yes, and they just said that again -- they are saying that bitcoin is currently difficult to buy and sell, and that the ETF's goal is to reduce this buy/sell friction. To do so it needs to battle with the current difficulty of purchasing/selling bitcoins in the first place.

I too have been telling my friends about bitcoin. However I have told them the same thing that I have been telling everyone for years:
***DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN.***
Decide on an amount of fiat to exchange for BTC.
Trade 5% of that fiat for BTC every week for 20 weeks.
Most of them don't listen, and if things go well we say yay! If things go bad then I say "I feel your pain but I wish you would have listened."
I follow my own advice by the way, and I buy in slowly and consistently -- it greatly reduces risk. Note that you get more coins at lower prices than higher prices too: $200 buys only 1.5 coins at $133 but it buys 2.5 coins at $85, so your average buy in price between those two purchases would actually be only $100. By the time 20 weeks pass with this strategy you're likely in good shape.
Think about it -- BTC has been up year over year *every single year* since inception, but it was also possible to buy at the wrong time ($30 in June 2011, $250 in ~~May~~ April 2013) and see losses for a long time. But if you dollar cost average in over ~6 months then you greatly reduce your chances of catching these (basically impossible to time) events.
[A slightly more complex but more optimal strategy is VA (instead of DCA).](

- New products and services are made available for bitcoins in this subreddit almost every day lately, so the "basket of goods" one is already happening.
- I personally know someone that is working on a bitcoin futures market. It is extremely likely that even if he fails, someone else will make one, because there is currently (at the current state of bitcoin, and in the state of bitcoin a year ago as well) a market opportunity there.
- The "exchanges are more robust" bullet point is obviously highly likely to come true, as multiple better exchange services are already in development, and MtGox is reworking their trade engine.
So that leaves the "market cap" bullet point. That one is directly tied to price, so that is the only one that is a big question mark. I personally think the price will rise in the long term, but I cannot provide you with a guarantee of this, so I can't really argue that bullet point to your satisfaction.

Yes, but litecoin and many altcoins have been around for a long while and did not help with this. And I don't see how having litecoin added to MtGox a year ago would have prevented the recent chain fork bug?


Well some would argue that competition between the inflatable fiat currencies could be a really bad thing (google currency wars).

No. There is a sequence of english words that can represent *every* random key.
The vast majority of these word sequences is easier to remember than their corresponding random private keys.
I haven't used Electrum in a while, but I believe later versions of Electrum exploit this by generating a word sequence from your random seed. (So you'll have a sequence like "donkey banana computer brick ball ..." to represent your key.)

I don't think it makes sense to ask me to spend an hour (or however long) setting up GPU password cracking software when there is concrete evidence in articles like that.


Wait you wrote a *sentence*? Come on... we've already established that software to do this task is not yet built or at least if it is it's not widely distributed. It's nontrivial to make and if it has the same entropy as cracking a 7 char password (like you suggested) then it's clear from the above article that this task is in the same realm as the 8 character cracking the machine mentioned above can do in a few hours.


Not every book, but a significant fraction of them. If 1 million people take your advice, someone is going to steal a lot of bitcoins.
Ever heard of the Google Library Project? :)
Guarding against password cracking is about envisioning what is within the realm of feasibility, and then picking a password that is *well outside* that realm.
Picking a verbatim phrase from a book is *well inside* the realm of feasible cracking.


You can approach it using a Markov model, the way that software like SwiftKey predicts the next word you will type. You don't have to get the rules perfect to reduce the entropy greatly.
If you don't know what a Markov model is then basically you just assign the probability of word2 given word1. Then you test the highest probability words first when forming sentences to test.
There are probably other ways. Again we don't have to think of the exact algorithm -- it is enough to see that entropy can be reduced with grammar rules (it is dangerous to say "I can't think of exactly how so I'm sure I'm safe!").

Wow that is so backwards I don't know where to begin.
100M satoshis = 1 BTC.
*That* clearly breaks SI symmetry. How can you say that using an SI unit breaks SI symmetry?


Satoshis are not necessarily the base unit. Many agree that we will subdivide the satoshi when necessary. A bitcoin is the base unit, the unit guaranteed not to change.


The average non-math inclined person would prefer to say 1 million microbits instead of 100 million satoshis. Those both represent 1 bitcoin by the way -- which one is simpler?
You could say 1K microbits to represent 1/1000th of a bitcoin, or you could say 100K satoshis to represent 1/1000th of a bitcoin. See the symmetry problem?

No. They are infinitely divisible.


You can't say much about future miner advantages since there's plenty of room for hardware efficiency advancements.


Taking difficulty increases into account as well, the reward is not too far from what it was 6 months ago.
Mining always trends toward 0 profit, as the number of miners expands and contracts with mining profitability.
Eventually, the price will be very stable, like gold. The price will be very unstable for a long time before then.


What? Lots of miners are probably barely profitable. Think of all the people that ordered FPGAs with no trade in options just 4-6 months ago.
Miners that bought 7970s 4-6 months ago did okay, but they would have done a lot better by just buying bitcoins at $5.

6 litecoin confirms is not equivalent to 6 bitcoin confirms though.
6 litecoin confirms means that we expect that 12 minutes of proof of work was done. 6 bitcoin confirms means that we expect that 60 minutes of proof of work was done.
It is 4 times faster to get 6 litecoin confirms, but it is not 4 times faster to get the same amount of security. It is true that litecoin confirms are more incremental, and I even think that a 2.5 min confirm time is better -- but its just not a very big difference and it's certainly nothing innovative.

No it isn't.
If the cost of a new ASIC is $1 million and it costs $1 to pay for electricity costs to run that unit for a year, then you will never get anywhere near the $432k/day in electricity costs that you suggest, because the capital cost of the ASIC is the vast majority of the cost of the ASIC, and therefore the electrical cost barely affects the miners profit/loss calculation.
In other words, a miner will only buy an ASIC if the miner thinks that the cost of the ASIC will be recovered via mining. If electricity cost is a tiny fraction of the cost of the ASIC, then electricity costs do not affect the decision to buy the ASIC or not.

An individual exchange can do whatever it wants. That's deregulation. We're suggesting that they use that power to fix their service. We are not asking for all exchanges to have anti HFT rules or something.
That said, if MtGox doesn't figure it out, it might actually be better for bitcoin in the long run, as they are decentralizing the exchange market by failing so badly.

Not really.
If there are 40 characters to choose from then it takes about 40 times as long to bruteforce a 10 character password than a 9 character password. (Edit: Yes, this is true. Do the math.)
It's only going to make it something like ~4% faster if he's starting from 1 character passwords.
Dear downvoters: Sorry, but you don't know what's going on.
It only affects the amount of work he has to do by a few percent because cracking a 10 char password takes far longer than trying all the combinations of 9 char and smaller passwords. So if he was starting from 1 char passwords anyway, he only does a little more work before getting to 10 chars.

That doesn't really make sense. The odds of what? What do you mean the "expected" odds?
Probabilities are always &lt;= 1 by definition.
Maybe you meant to say something about the [expected value]( of your bet?
The odds of winning the bet are the same on an island of course, not that the bet is even placed on an island...
In the island example, the odds of winning the bet are the same (it's more slightly likely that you will lose than win), however the payoff if you win is much higher than the amount that you bet. So the expected value of betting is much higher than your bet of 0.1 BTC.

Log scale.
Log scale doesn't actually change the amount of volatility, it just gives you a line that looks less volatile.
For all the reasons that volatility matters to a currency, having a chart display log scale doesn't do anything. If the price moves 30% in a day, then 30% of a bitcoin holder's purchasing power increases/decreases.

I got into [a discussion with this fellow]( about historical bitcoin price stability. In fact, he basically insists that it was stable.
I think this might be because default charts show the current bubble, which shrinks down past prices, and hides how much they really did vary.
Remember that most redditors do not post anything or even vote on comments/links.
Where there is one redditor, there are many more.
The price of a bitcoin has always been volatile, and probably will be for years to come. Stability is coming eventually, but **get used to the volatility now, because it isn't going away for a long time**.

More than 18 BTC, though I have already heard some devs interested in giving this project more priority.
This is subjective, since some devs would work on this for free time permitting, but for a talented developer to devote several months to this to produce a "real" CoinJoin, you'd have to more than cover his salary. Basically that's $30k-$40k.
So we're about 1/4 of the way there.
Blockchain.info's "shared send" is basically a poor man's CoinJoin, so that gives you an idea of how simple this idea is to implement (in the big scheme of things).
A "real" CoinJoin would piggyback on one of the popular clients (e.g. Multibit or Bitcoin-qt) and would find other Multibit/bitcoinqt clients and shared send with them.
If it's built into bitcoind then random bitcoin websites would start having CoinJoin functionality, blacklisting anyone CoInvalidation style would quickly become silly, and CoinJoin would rapidly become the norm.

My point was that dollar cost averaging over several days or more would put you in a much better position than buying at $250, and it would do so without you needing to know whether $250 was the local maximum or not.

If CoinJoin was widely used (which I certainly believe it would be) then there would be CoinJoin addresses and non-CoinJoin addresses.
You could blacklist all CoinJoin addresses, and therefore most bitcoin users, but there would be no reason to say that a CoinJoin user deserves to be blacklisted if the most common bitcoin clients include CoinJoin as part of their default functionality.

This sub has 80000 subscribers, plus all the non-subscribers. Only 10% of reddit users have accounts, so there are something like 0.5 - 1.0 million users reading this subreddit.
So this subreddit has a reach on the order of a million users, plus many individuals here are known to own millions of dollars worth of bitcoins.
Dear downvoters;
Two years ago we only needed to have $2.8 million worth of coins held by subscribers here to have $1 billion today, as the price was $2 when this subreddit had about 10000 subscribers. I had a lot of coins at that time, and I wasn't even a subscriber yet (even though I lurked quite a bit).
Of course, even if you don't think this sub controls $1 billion, it is known that multiple known reddit users have $10 million+ worth of coins each, so it is easy to see how posts in this sub can affect the price.
A few million dollars worth of coins sold can massively move the price in this illiquid market.

It's true, tools for this will come eventually, and solutions will come in the form of maybe green addresses, or something else.
Even if you want to try to doublespend a 0 conf transaction, you are going to get caught at some point. A block will go through before you exit the shop, and the doublespend will be visible, and then bad things happen.

The price in the past was just as volatile as the price today -- sometimes more volatile than today!
[Here is a random segment of time: October 2011 and the 5 months following it.](
You can see that the price went from $2 to $7 to $5 in less than 3 months.
In the middle of october, there was a day where the price moved from $3.75 to $2.25. A **66%** price movement. There are many days like that.
That makes todays (May 3rds) price movements look tame by comparison. A $110 to $80 movement is less than a 38% movement.


What? We are talking about price volatility. A silk silk road purchase cost a lot more than 10 bitcoins typically, back when the price was a few dollars.
And consumers interact with merchants, and merchants have to set the price of their goods.

So you don't think your heuristic can be improved? :)
I thought the point was to construct a rule that automatically sets a reasonable confirm time so that a service is not doublespent just because the admin is asleep at the moment of a fork, and we also don't want the rule to allow malicious miners to increase the confirm time needlessly.
Your heuristic might as well say "if size of fork is 4 then stop processing deposits". I'm also not sure what you mean by size of fork. It's really easy to create a fork of size 4, even with a very small amount of hash power (like 1% of total hashpower would allow you to make a fork of size 4 in less than a week easily).

That won't prove anything either way. You'll be stuck arguing whether or not you made/lost money, the same as now.
The following is not really a matter of a opinion, it is just math:
Assume that you want to make a profit, and assume for simplicity that your electricity is free, and that your time costs nothing.
Then if you buy the ASICMiner unit at 50 BTC:
- If it generates less than 50 BTC for you before it dies, then buying the ASIC was the **wrong choice**.
- If it generates more than 50 BTC, then buying it was the **right choice**.
If you understand what I just said, then it should be pretty hard to disagree, regardless of your opinions about mining or anything else.
Now assuming you agree with the above, then you'll notice that this is totally independent of how you got that BTC. You either gained more BTC, or you didn't.

MtGox and Bitstamp price are both also $100 higher than BTC-e price.

No, I am saying that:

Actually in that case their hopes about the future BTC price is irrelevant.
For people who already bought in BTC or fiat or gold bars, they are going to mine as long as they are mining more BTC than their operating costs (e.g. electricity cost).
If the price of a BTC falls or they mine fewer coins per day than their electricity costs per day, then if they are rational they will turn their mining device off regardless of what they think the future BTC price will be.

That is because with a good rating system, in the long term sellers profit much more by actually delivering a good product.
Merchants typically deal with orders of magnitude more sales an individual consumer and therefore have much to lose.
Ebay might be an example of where this is not as true, but bitmit (which is essentially bitcoins version of ebay) has *escrow*. When you need reversability bitcoin can implement it.
When fiat doesnt want to have reversibility, you have little choice -- it is almost always reversible.

This point has been addressed hundreds of times (literally) in this subreddit and however many more times elsewhere on the internet.
It is not a problem because ECDSA is known to be weakened by Quantum machines, and the use of ECDSA is not set in stone (that is, there will be a protocol change to address this).
You also still can't steal coins from an address that has only had coins sent to it (but has never been spent from), even with quantum machines.


Even from a purely theoretical point of view, and even accepting that this will take potentially millions of years, consider that as long as you have a nonzero amount of coins, you can extend divisibility of the coins indefinitely, so we will never run out of coins as long as there is a nonzero amount.
A change to the protocol at a stage where there is only 1 satoshi left is also not out of the question (again this is hundreds or thousands or millions of years from now).

Bitcoin can rise against all other currencies without implication that all other currencies are going down.
Remember that the value of all bitcoins is currently quite small compared to say, the value of all USD.
If I created an alt coin right now and then offered to buy 1 of my alt coins for $30, and and I issued 5 altcoins so far, then the market cap of my altcoin is only $150, and my altcoin has increased in value much faster than all other currencies. It doesn't mean that any of those currencies have fallen in value.

That's like saying that Bitcoin has a hard floor that it can't afford to drop below (cost of mining bitcoins).

I keep seeing this flawed logic in so I will try to address it here.
Suppose for argument's sake that you somehow *know* that difficulty will rise fast enough so that you make fewer coins from this device than you paid for it in coins.
Let's say for example you spend 20 BTC on the device and it mines back 18 BTC over its lifetime.
I will assume you have free electricity and are willing to work for free (0 labor cost).
Now you had to buy 20 BTC to get this device.
If you *know* that you will get less than 20 BTC back from the device then it doesn't matter if you are trying profit in fiat or BTC, either way holding those 20 BTC would be more profitable than effectively trading 20 BTC for 18 BTC!
If the price of a bitcoin rises, then the 20 BTC is worth more than the 18 BTC mined.
If the price of a bitcoin falls, then the 18 BTC you get from the machine will never be worth more than the fiat you spent on 20 BTC when the price was higher!
So if you purchase the device, then in fiat the only way you are going to profit in this situation is if the price of a bitcoin is at some point higher than the price at the time that you spent 20 BTC on the device. And even in this case, holding the 20 BTC would have been more profitable.

If that's true then it's also true that Bitcoin has no backing and has no value.

If you think it has no value then you should not care whether you pay tax in these valueless credits, right?
I honestly don't know what you are getting at. These are just semantics, the dollar has backing or doesn't have backing, depending on your definition of "backing".
Some people in this subreddit say *nothing* has intrinsic value. Some would also argue that it follows that *nothing* has "backing".

Lots of people have thought of it, it's just a bitch to implement it, so no one has.
For example, I talked about this concept with gmaxwell on IRC 1-2 years ago (and he's mentioned it to others I'm sure before me), and we discussed what would need to be written to implement this idea. I could think of a lot of other ideas that require a lot less work to build, with similar chance of success, so I moved on from this one.
It's an awesome idea, and I applaud coinlab if they've implemented it (or are implementing it). But even if coinlab dropped this project now, I would not start working on this, because it is such a big undertaking.

Buying more when the price falls has actually been shown to be even better than dollar cost averaging, on average (depending on the function you use).

Unless the magnitude you measure is market cap gain, in which case with a $100 starting point the price would only increase to about $200.

$2/day is $730/year. That would be an incredible return on a $300 investment.
If I thought that was the minimum, I would sell my house and spend it all on Jalapenos.
People will keep buying these until they consider the return too low, and the difficulty will keep going up as they are bought.
People might speculate and stop buying before this due to risk, but $2 a day is certainly a lot higher than the minimum you can expect to get from these.

But the price is not $45. The price is currently $140.
You were born with $0. If you lose all of your retirement savings tomorrow and have $0 again, do you say that you lost nothing, just because you started with nothing?
Don't average your losses. Count every gain, count every loss.
Similarly, if you bought 1000 BTC at $1 each, and then you lose 1000 BTC tomorrow, you didn't lose $1000. You lost $140k (at the current price of $140 per bitcoin).
Even if you somehow disagree with the above:
Suppose I offer to sell you 1MH/s of mining equipment right now for 50 BTC. You now have to make a choice. Take the equipment, or don't.
One of those choices gives you more purchasing power, and one doesn't.
What difference does it make at what price you bought your bitcoins at? If you choose the option that reduces your purchasing power, that is the wrong choice. Unless of course, you don't *want* to increase your purchasing power...


I also enjoy mining, but I don't understand that. Part of the fun of the mining game is maximizing profits (though balancing profit against other things... like fan noise in some cases).
Mining at negative profit is not fun for me, and might even be bad for Bitcoin! (Possibly bad because you are reducing the profit of other miners and therefore reducing the purchasing power of bitcoin users.)

The price of a coin in the short term shouldn't affect the price of the mining device very much, so it makes a lot of sense to price them in BTC.
If the mining device is expected to produce 1 BTC, then the price should be, say, 0.8 BTC no matter what the price of a bitcoin is.
The only way that the price of a bitcoin affects the price of a mining device, is in that long term price changes ultimately affect difficulty (as the price changes mining incentives).

You are specifically addressing tolls I think. VAT is a tax not associated with a specific activity. And it's called a tax (the "T" is for tax :)

Neither of those already existing taxes would be necessarily be affected by bitcoin.
Point taken about tolls, though there are things that we call tax that *are* associated with a specific activity, e.g. in Canada there is cigarette tax, liquor tax, gasoline tax, even writable CD tax.

So I think what you are saying, is that price instability is a problem with bitcoin as a currency?


No, they are rejoicing in a rise in price, and a gain in adoption. I think most bitcoin users do not want volatility in general.
The price will not be stable until Bitcoin has much wider adoption. The more goods there are for sale via bitcoins, the more the price of a bitcoin gets tied to a basket of goods that can be purchased with bitcoins.
Also with higher adoption comes greater market depth, which leads to price stability. Futures and short selling will probably also increase stability, when we have a solid trustworthy service providing those.

That's true. Ideally we would look at all the data and preserve the ratio of correct to incorrect speculation in this chart across however many samples we want to show (since we can't show all the samples and still have a short infographic type chart thingie).
That is pretty tough since the correctness of the thread titles shown is subjective. So this image has a subjective selection of thread titles over the chart period shown instead.
The point I'm trying to show more than anything is that there are so many wrong thread titles (and a few right ones), so users should beware of whatever remarks anyone has with regards to speculation about the price.
That said, **to show a point contrary to that** (i.e. that you should listen to the community's speculation because they are often right) **you'd have to try pretty hard to cherry pick** thread titles (they are not often right!). So I think my basic point holds pretty well, even if we don't have a perfectly scientific study backing my image :)

You might want to ask yourself why you're arguing with me. Insulting me is not an argument, it is not going to gain favor with me, and it is not going to gain favor with anyone else reading this.
You have not responded directly to very many of my statements. I have quoted you and responded directly to what you have said. Why don't you do me the same courtesy. You will be the one to benefit in the end.


I have a degree in CS (which is basically a math degree) and a minor in economics. Maybe that will help you reconsider whether I am really getting this early high school level math wrong. I'm not trying to be elitist here, I just genuinely want you think hard about whether I have sold [mining contracts and (created a management system for them)]( and created a [mining contract marketplace]( among other ventures, and really have no idea what I'm talking about ;)
From my perspective, I have clearly and directly contradicted your arguments, and you have yet to respond to my counterarguments.


No, investing in mining is a bet that you will gain more purchasing power via mining than you spent on the mining equipment.
If that 7950 worth 2 BTC generates 3 BTC via mining over the next 3 months, and the price of a bitcoin goes up over the next 3 months, then you did better by mining than by simply holding 2 BTC.
Please refute my claim in the previous sentence directly, instead of making me repeat it over and over. This claim directly contradicts what you have said, so if you can't refute it, then there is a problem with at least one of your arguments ;)

That is completely irrelevant. Just because you bought coins cheap doesn't mean you throw them away. This kind of thinking is always surprising to me, especially in this subreddit.


Irrelevant for the same reason.


Somewhat relevant, though I suspect not for the reason you think.
They do better in terms of their BTC return if the price of a bitcoin goes down (since difficulty wont rise as fast, if price doesn't), but worse overall since their purchasing power will fall.
They are paying in BTC so the price of a bitcoin in USD doesn't matter.
They either gain BTC by doing this, or lose some.
If they lose some then they made a bad decision, otherwise they made a good decision.
None of the issues you mentioned really affect this, except for the price of a bitcoin changing how much difficulty rises.

The price is locked in when you open a transaction, but the seller can do whatever he wants. He can sell to you at that price, or some other price, or not at all.

***Edit:*** Nevermind, you have an excellent point. Why would someone that has already constructed ASICs without preorders start selling them now? They wouldn't.
I sold [mining contracts]( for a while, I profited, the purchasers of the contracts profited.
I would have made more if I had just mined on my own, and not sold contracts. However, it was *far* less risky for me to sell contracts, and I couldn't afford to risk the very large amount of money spent on mining equipment.
I also gained trust with clients, and those clients are now more likely to trust my future projects. Companies like BFL can benefit from this effect as well (who knows what they have planned for the future).
The ASICs in the OP look like a scam. But there are at least a few good reasons to want to sell ASICs. Lower risk to the ASIC producer is one, and preventing disruption of bitcoin by taking a huge chunk of the mining rewards for yourself is another, and gaining reputation for future projects is another (though I don't know if BFL is doing a great job on that front so far...).

It's true, and things may change. All I can tell you with certainty, is how miners have behaved historically.

Late 20s here. CS degree with minor in economics.
I remember someone once posted stats from youtube viewers of bitcoin related videos and found that the average age was in the low 40s (but that might be a youtube thing, maybe bitcoin users abroad don't have use youtube much, but are younger).
I buy/sell on localbitcoins, I would guess that the average age of traders is in the late 30s. I once had a male buyer that was maybe 13 years old, apart from that, all traders appear to be over 20.
About 95% of buyers are male, but that could be a localbitcoins thing (females might be less likely to meet to trade cash with a stranger).

You keep making this argument all over the place, but the time cost is mostly less than a day for integration with BitPay, and then a tiny bit of maintenance time when you actually make bitcoin sales (to collect money from your bitpay account once in a while).

Say you want to spend $1000 on bitcoins. So put some money in an exchange, and once per week buy $50 worth of bitcoins.

Having more MH/s doesn't make you get a return faster.


Reasonable time for a return on mining (for ASICs) is more like 1 year. You might get a return sooner, but if ordering ASICs now, then that is what you should expect, and be prepared for.
For GPUs though, if you buy some now, then it's very plausible that you will never see a positive return on investment.

Yeah my mapping was clearly not one-to-one again, oops :P
I'm a CS guy, not a mathematician. Countability of sets turns out not to come up much when actually coding things.


That's trivially easy though because you can just do:
f(x) = sqrt(-1)
For *any* non-empty set, this achieves what you want. Doesn't matter what the set is, including real numbers.
So for mapping R-&gt;C one-to-one and onto I think we can do this:
    f(x) = {
        sqrt(-1)*x + 1        if x &gt; 0
        sqrt(-1)*x            if x &lt; 0
        sqrt(-1)              if x == 0
    }
I'm not sure if we accomplished something meaningful though. The above works because the complex space is bigger than the real space. Both Real and Complex numbers are uncountable BTW.

If daytraders create more volatility, then in the case of bitcoin they hurt it as a currency (a long term goal), but increase its attractiveness to some as a speculative tool (a short term gain).
If they reduce volatility then they help bitcoin.

If we give these day traders futures to trade, then they might actually reduce volatility, though I can't say I'm certain of it.

Well, the problem is reduced but there is still a small problem. Are we going to recommend to people that they use blockchain.info and that they should not ever update the app until a trusted source (who?) reviews the new version and determines that it can't steal your coins?
I use blockchain.info, but I have &lt;1% of my total coins in my BCI wallet. I like to recommend blockchain.info to newbies, but I also like to recommend that users do not store a majority of their coins there, if they have a lot of coins. This is because I know that many users will just blindly update the app (or won't use the app at all), and I do not want to be responsible for their loss, if there ever is one. It only takes one guy with sufficient access and ability at blockchain.info's hosting provider to steal some coins.
Certainly the advice "use the app, and don't update it until at least several weeks after an update is issued" is better advice than just "hey, use blockchain.info".
So thanks for pointing that out, I'll update my future advice to newbies accordingly :)

What? No. If the price of a bitcoin is going up, and if buying mining equipment increases the number of bitcoins you hold, then the sensible thing is obviously to buy the equipment.


if you gain more coins than you spend on the equipment, then buying the equipment was better than just holding coins.


Again it depends on difficulty -- if you gain more coins than you spend on the equipment, then buying the equipment was better than just holding coins.

I don't play satoshidice.
 is an example that might make it more clear that there is at least one situation where you can make a sane bet on satoshidice:
Let's say there is a "dead man's hand" bitcoin service that stores your 10000 bitcoins. If you don't send 1 BTC to it once per year, then all of your coins are sent to charity.
You get stranded on an island for 364 days. You are rescued and come home with 5 minutes left to send 1 BTC to the service, otherwise all of your coins will go to charity.
You have 0.9 BTC in your old phone wallet. You only have 5 minutes to get another 0.1 BTC to send to the service, or else you lose all your money.
You have 10000 BTC stored in the dead man's hand service.
Your choices are:
- Do nothing and lose 10000 BTC.
- Bet on satoshidice, giving you a relatively high chance of gaining the 0.1 BTC needed, and therefore saving you 10000 BTC.
Which do you choose?

I mean that SI prefixes work like this:
1000 units = 1000 smaller units = 1000 even smaller units
With satoshis, we have:
100 units = 1000 smaller units = 1000 even smaller units
So instead of 1000 everywhere, we have 100 in there randomly.
This is because 100M satoshis = 1 bitcoin.
(Instead of say, 1M satoshis = 1 bitcoin.)
If only 1 million satoshis was equal to 1 bitcoin, right? Then everything would be nice and neat!
Well, 1 million uBTC = 1 bitcoin. So we could use that instead!

I hate to say this but as the thread went on you handled that worse and worse.
I completely understand why, and I don't blame you for getting frustrated. But you have to keep in mind that if you respond aggressively you will put people on the defensive and they will just entrench themselves in their current stance.
By being aggressive in your replies, you are actually pushing them away from bitcoin by:
- making them try hard to defend a point of view that is anti-bitcoin
- making them associate negative behavior with bitcoin
- giving others reading your comment incentive to attack you and/or be more aggressive toward you, which escalates the room temperature
If you want to defend bitcoin in a thread like that, you pretty much have to be like a really good tech support guy, and smile all day and have infinite patience, no matter how stupid the other party is.
It also helps to add smiley faces here and there :)
(But not too many.)
This advice applies to any argument on the internet -- not just bitcoin. And I have won a great many arguments on the internet (after having lost probably thousands), despite the seemingly widespread belief that it is impossible. It requires being humble, even a little self deprecation sometimes, to get people on your side (when arguing via text on the internet).
Also remember that you aren't just trying to convince the guy you're replying to -- in fact that is the secondary goal. You are primarily trying to convince everyone else reading your comment. There are a lot more people reading your comments than just that other guy you're replying to, and there will be even more in the years that the comment might last on the internet.
All that said, belitting the other guy works when you take the conversation and present it to others, e.g. Maddox style ("look at what this fucking idiot said to me...").

Their wallet service is actually very useful.
For example:
A buyer asks a seller for 1 BTC. The buyer is told the verification code is "BFG123".
The seller deposits 1 BTC to fund the transaction.
When the seller and buyer meet, the seller either via the localbitcoins website, or by sending a text message to localbitcoins, can release the 1 BTC to the seller. Localbitcoins then tells the seller the verification code "BFG123".
Now the seller can tell the buyer the verification code, and the buyer knows that the funds have been released to him!
So this way, the buyer doesn't need to have any type of device for this transaction, and the seller doesn't even need to have internet access.

IIRC the memorydealers guy used his connection with blockchain.info to identify someone that defrauded him, and then someone on reddit suggested that this means that he had access to his coins somehow, though that was not the case.
Blockchain.info should be considered safe for small amounts in my opinion. I use it to have access to some coins on my phone.


That's true, though if you use a JS verifier you'll very likely be safe in the event of a hack, and blockchain can't intentionally run off with your money either.
I consider it safe enough to hold sub $100 amounts, and to introduce newcomers to bitcoin.

Transistors on the ASIC used for memory cost the same as transistors used for computation.
As long as you can fit one Scrypt processing core on an ASIC chip, then you will have a chip that outperforms a GPU (probably), and you're done.
I also don't know exactly how much memory scrypt needs, but I know it uses less than 256kb. You can fit that on an ASIC, no DDR needed.

is talking about removing bitcoins altogether and just having satoshis, and is claiming that this will make it easier for newcomers to understand.
Disagreeing about the base unit is one thing, but I don't understand how this subreddit is upvoting the idea of saying forget a bitcoin altogether, this will make it simpler!
Even if you're right about dividing a satoshi, a satoshi is still an inferior base unit compared to a microbit, simply due to this:
1M uB = 1 BTC.
100M satoshi = 1 BTC.
The first one is just simpler, when you start talking about 1/10000th of a bitcoin and smaller because of the SI symmetry as you go down the SI prefixes (everything is 1000, instead of having that random 100 in there).
That said, I disagree that dividing a satoshi is not important. It is highly important in order to avoid the problem that money supply deflation can have if you get stuck with too large a unit.
We need to talk about smaller units even if they are off the blockchain. We need tiny payments -- almost arbitrarily tiny payments -- in order to allow people to pay however little they need to in order to buy the cheapest goods available.

Well, you can't know how much data is in a block before you actually download the block.

That's a good idea, but I don't want the core dev team to spend time on that right now. I'll mention your idea. If I find time I might implement it myself, it doesn't sound too difficult, though some might oppose the idea of broadcasting block size before receiving blocks.

They have $250k worth of orders on day 1.

The highest order number singles listed here have been marked as delivered: 
So they might be getting close. If the first day represents 4% of their total sales and it has taken them say a week to get through that, then linearly extrapolating tells us that they ship the rest of their current orders over 6 months at the current rate.

That makes no sense. 
The price is established by measuring the value of trades between buyers and *sellers*. You can't have a trade without a seller. 
When the price fell last bubble it is because many people sold rapidly, not due to a lack of sellers. 
Besides, fewer sellers leads to a scarcer short term supply and therefore a higher price!

There is no such thing as "full confirm". More confirms means higher "security", which in hindsight is the wrong word to use. Higher confidence that the transaction will not be reversed.

From OP article:


@_date: 2013-11-21 20:18:48
Yes but [the discussion happening right now]( is to get rid of bitcoins and start talking about only satoshis.
In that case talking about mili/micro/pico coins is a big problem because people will not have a notion of bitcoins, but only of satoshis.
100M satoshis = 1 bitcoin, so SI symmetry is broken. 1M microbits = 1 bitcoin, so you can continue to use SI prefixes for amounts smaller than 1 ***or*** amounts larger than 1, whichever suits you.
In other words, converting between satoshis and bitcoins is much harder than converting between microcoins (uBTC) and bitcoins.
It's an important difference and not one to just brush aside. Brushing it aside is what we've been doing for years and the result is that we don't have exchanges using smaller units, we have newcomers not buying coins because "one bitcoin is too expensive", and merchants pricing in insane amounts like "0.000763 bitcoins".

Mining with a single GPU that you already have might amount to a dollar a day if you're lucky, at an average $/kWh electricity cost. So even though that more than covers electricity costs, it's very questionable whether it is worth a user's time to bother with the $30/month for 3-4 months.

However, Bitcoin is **extremely fast** compared to traditional banking transfers.

You are arguing about whether they think/need the BTC will rise.
I am telling you that **this makes no difference** whatsoever to their decision to mine if they have already bought equipment (unless selling their equipment is a possibility, but that just means that someone else will mine with their equipment).
They are going to mine as long as their operating costs are covered.


In that scenario, as I said, they will mine because their operating costs will be covered. This is true regardless of how they paid for their mining equipment.
In another scenario where the BTC price falls to $10: They will continue to mine if their operating costs are covered (e.g. electricity cost), and they won't otherwise.
No matter what, someone is mining with that mining equipment until it costs more to run than it mines.
By the way: If you need the BTC price to rise in order for mining to be profitable for you, then you would have been better off buying coins (you would have profited even more from an increase in BTC price).

That said, this thread is not really about a system failure. The bitcoin network will very likely be mostly unaffected by the issue in the OP. Many users will not even notice that this was ever a problem, as it is only a problem with bitcoin-qt/bitcoind, and not everyone uses that client.

Note that the exchange rate itself doesn't tell you anything about the currencies strength.
For example if Satoshi had chosen for the bitcoin cap to be 210 million instead of 21 million, then we'd have 10x as many coins right now, and the price would be $50 instead of $500.
If he had chosen for the cap to be 2.1 million then the price would be $5000/coin and we'd have 1/10th as many coins.
These numbers are just arbitrary. All that matters for bitcoin is the market cap (monetary base) -- the value of *all* the currency units together. The value of one individual unit is arbitrary.
For the KWD what matters is the value of all of the units of currency, not the price per individual unit of currency.

That is not at all what I said. Since you are not getting it, here are two examples:
- If you are trying to maximize only the number of dollars you have, and you predict that the price of a bitcoin in dollars will rise or stay the same, then the only thing you need to calculate in order to know whether buying mining equipment is worth it, is the future mining difficulty.
- If you are trying to maximize only the number of bitcoins that you have, then obviously the only thing you need to calculate to know whether buying the mining equipment is worth it, is the future mining difficulty.
Does this make it more clear for you?
Which other unit are you using as a measure of your profitability if not dollars or BTC? I will apply this argument to that measure for you, if it is a sane one.

My whole point is that the reason this was not developed was ***not*** because people didn't think of it. It's mainly because it is a difficult product to develop.

So many reasons, but here's a couple:
Threads are not persistent on reddit. Think of all the times we've linked to  the [CoinJoin thread]( That doesn't work on reddit.
Reddit promotes circlejerking -- controversial opinions don't get seen. New content in threads is buried.
Standard repetitive replies are upvoted to the top over and over.
Reddit doesn't have all the forum subsections, and subreddits don't fully capture that idea. Buy/sell subforums on bitcointalk are so much better than reddit buy/sell forums partly due to the chronological nature of forums. How do you hold an organized auction on reddit?
In general reddit just doesn't promote long thorough discussion as well as the forum does. Reddit is somewhere between the long replies of the forum, and twitter. Reddit votes 1 sentence pun comments that contribute little serious value over the seriously useful stuff.
Reddit is great, but it serves a different purpose from the forum.
@_date: 2013-03-13 07:12:55
I also thought that no money was lost. That is not clear anymore.


Of course not.
But there is a transaction in the 0.8 chain and the 0.7 chain.
BTC-e accepted the 0.8 transaction, which was then reversed on them when we switched to the 0.7 chain.
The OP of the bitcointalk thread therefore was able to keep the $9800 OKPay credited him with (which he could have used to buy litecoins at BTC-e), yet it cost him 0 BTC in the end.
@_date: 2013-09-17 18:24:35
These are not comparable. I don't think you understand what the W3C would be setting a standard of. 
They are defining a standard for a button or two, and a form maybe. Who cares if the W3C standard of this payment interface is followed to the letter? They can't change the bitcoin protocol. They aren't trying to define the Bitcoin protocol from scratch or emulate it or anything like that. 
How far away do you think they can really deviate from the "Send X coins to address Y when button is pressed" standard?
Some browsers might give a prompt in one way, others in a different way. It's very hard to imagine how there could be a compatibility problem with a standard that simple.

What do ASICs to do with this? You can buy a ton of coins any time you want, and have been able to do this for years.
No one party has all the ASICs. Buying an ASIC increasingly looks like a proposition of getting the value of the ASIC in coins over the course of 1 year. If your goal is price manipulation, you're much better off just buying the coins from various sources over the course of 2 months.

I don't know, my comparison involved both ounces and bitcoins, and my comparison was not meaningless. This is because the arbitrary units sort of "cancel each other" out in my comparison :)
I suppose some might have preferred for me to have said that silver's market cap is 4500x the size of bitcoin's, and thus the price of a bitcoin has to be 4500x higher for bitcoin's market cap to equal silver's. This wouldn't involve arbitrary denominations like ounces and satoshis.

That's a good point and that should be taken into account. However there is a bug in your method:

Then I didn't explain the situation well, because there are very likely cases when you would be more than happy to put $10 in escrow temporarily to get a seller to drive to you.
Again, it is not a payment, it is temporarily putting $10 in escrow, which you get back when you buy an item that you already know that you want.
That said, the price of this is negotiable. The seller would set the price at maybe $1. Or maybe the seller could arrange to give a $30 discount if you buy the item, if you agree to risk $10 to view it. On ebay you can't even view the item in person *at all*.
There have been cases where I would be happy to ~~pay~~ risk $10 to get the seller to travel to me, because I *already know that I want to buy* based on the pictures and description of the item, but the seller *won't travel to me* because he doesn't want to risk wasting his time. I want to prove to him that he isn't wasting his time, so I put some money in escrow, without having to risk the full purchase amount.
Also note that the seller does *not* gain the $10 if you don't buy, and the seller has a reputation at risk as well.
Anyway the point is that you can't do any of this stuff with cash.

That's the same level of volatility as moving from $110 to $84.6 in a single day.
- There is a candle on your chart a high of $5.2 and a low of $4.4. 18%.
- There is a candle with a high of $5.3 and a low of $4.5. 17%.
And you picked the most stable period bitcoin has ever seen in all of bitcoinchart's historical data.

True, though I never claimed that it did.
Insurance doesn't increase returns either, but it is still often worth purchasing.
If OP insists on investing his entire life savings into one place (which he does) then VA (or even DCA) is a better strategy because although it doesn't increase expected returns, it greatly reduces his risk of losing much of what he has.
That said, I'll give it some more thought and research before suggesting it to users here again.

The problem with this is that if people do that, then market depth becomes really thin and we lose some price stability.
Margin leverage would help with this though (because a smaller amount of funds could be left in the exchange while maintaining the same buying/selling power).

Even if we don't raise the transaction limit (which we probably will), you can still have a monetary system based on bitcoin with unlimited transactions per unit time.
eBay sellers would just say "we accept Bitcoin (direct payment), CoinBase, MtGox, BitStamp, etc., payments".
Then each of these companies could provably show that they actually have all of the bitcoins that they claim to have (by proving which addresses are theirs). So there can be no house-of-cards fractional banking type of activity.
For some people, allowing an online wallet service to handle their money is preferrable -- simply because some non-techie users want to pay for tech support and escrow.
I remember at some point Satoshi viewed bitcoin as eventually being used for big payments only, and payment services handle all the really small transactions.
So although I don't know which path will be taken exactly, the future is still very bright in the face of the current 4.1 tx/sec limit.

I was responding to idea that the BTC price somehow matters.
I was showing that the BTC price doesn't matter using the example of paying the full price of the unit which is 2000 BTC.
If you spend 1 BTC on a ticket and win a machine worth 500 BTC (or whatever it is worth) then obviously you have already profited greatly, since you could just sell the machine.
But that has nothing to do with this discussion, which is about whether the current price of a BTC affects ROI of mining with this device.
Your point that you *could* win a big amount is a little silly -- that's like saying you can win the lottery. So what? Expected ROI of playing the lottery is negative.

It's possible for *everyone* to have an ROI time of 2 years you know.
There were people a few months ago who were mining at a loss. (As in, daily mining generated less money than the cost of electricity just to run their rigs.)

Future capital costs are not sunk costs. 


Correct. However a miner speculates whether his ASIC will be profitable, and this depends on capital costs.
Consider that many people have free electricity, yet do not purchase a 7970 because they worry that they will not recover the $300 (plus their labor) that it costs to buy a 7970. In this case electricy cost is *zero* but if you think it will take 3 years to pay for the device, then it is not worth the effort (AKA it will not pay for your labor cost).

I'm not a big fan of satoshidice, and I don't bet there, but it is possible for the outcome of your bet to have a positive expected value, even if the chances of you winning are less than 50%.
Imagine that satoshidice offered a promotional bet, where you have a 40% chance to win, 60% chance to lose, but they let you bet 1 BTC, and if you win, you win 10 BTC.
Would you take that bet?
Also, please note that I am not trying to convince you that I have some sort of winning betting system or something. There isn't one. The point I'm making is that there actually *are* situations where it makes sense to take a bet that has a lower than 50% win chance, if the win event is worth sufficiently more than the lose event. With satoshidice, this is sometimes possible. There was a guy on that bought too few bitcoins to make a purchase. He didn't want to have to jump through hoops to get 0.1 BTC more, so he just placed a bet on satoshidice to save time, and make sure that he could get the product he wanted before it was out of stock. That's not quite the same as my examples, but it's maybe not a terrible use of satoshidice either.

Numbers do not occupy space, and do not have weight, since they are not physical.

0-conf is not the issue. The issue is that you can tap your credit card against the NFC device and you have paid. Currently you can't do that with bitcoin (face-to-face bitcoin is currently very clumsy).
Even if you can one day tap-pay with bitcoin, what is the benefit to the user of having to obtain bitcoins for this? This isn't a strong use case for bitcoin. It doesn't drive demand for bitcoins. It's just a side benefit if you already have coins for some other reason to begin with.
I argued the side that it *was* useful to have this in coffee shops, but the other guy made some good arguments (some I just mentioned) too.
So my point before, is that demand for privacy changes this use case dramatically in favor of Bitcoin.

You mean how Bitcoin currently needs an exchange?
You wouldn't really *need* an exchange, since colored coins can be used with just a piece of software so you could send them to anyone else with that software. 
An exchange is probably how it would be set up anyway, though like bitcoin currently is, you could have many exchanges. It would not be a single centralized exchange for all colored coins.

"Public service announcement" type posts tend to get a lot more visibility than posts about incremental development of new bitcoin products and services.
You are noticing the bad a lot more than the good.


I have been using Bitcoin for years, conducted a great many transactions, and I haven't lost a penny to a scam.


The virus that recently got a lot of visibility is an old virus that has little to do with bitcoin, it just recently changed its payment method to bitcoin.


Bitcoin is very new, with lots of new businesses opening. 90% of businesses fail in general. Bitcoin trading sites fail far less often than that.
Yes, startups go out of business, but they seem to be wildly more successful in the bitcoin world than other startups are elsewhere, on average.
All that said, if you have a negative view of bitcoin, then don't use it yet. The Bitcoin community doesn't gain much from someone who doesn't like it (no offense).

"mining" is finding blocks. Mining is the way in which transactions on the bitcoin network are verified as being genuine and irreversible.
Miners are paid for their effort in finding blocks.


They are not free. Mining equipment is expensive to build/purchase and costs time and electricity to run. In fact, many here will tell you that buying mining equipment costs more than you get back in the bitcoins that the equipment gains. This is basically because there are many many miners, and only a limited number of coins to distribute to all of them.

Looking at the difficulty chart is not going to predict future difficulty for you, because ASICs have barely started shipping. (E.g. BFL has shipped zero SC singles to my knowledge.)
I suggest that you:
1. Guess what the future price of a bitcoin will be 1 year from now (good luck :).
2. Assume that people will pay for ASICs as long as they are profitable for 1 year from the date of sale, at the price of a bitcoin at the date of sale and difficulty at the date of sale.
3. Now see how many ASICs would be added to the network at the current ASIC price per GH/s.
I did this last week and roughly this model predicts that difficulty would increase to 80x the current difficulty.
The actual difficulty increase could be 20x or 1000x. We don't know. We don't know what the price of a bitcoin will be, what the price of ASICs will be, how much people will over/under buy ASICs.

Unless you do something like what I mentioned, then your servers and customers ***do*** have a problem.

To me, having to ask a customer how much he would like to tip is a *problem* (because it is awkward and unpleasant and less convenient than cash), and that is how it is currently done via BitPay at Charlie Shrem's bar in New York.
*TLDR:* The real point here is that it's not good to introduce bars to bitcoin when it isn't quite ready for them. They will be more accepting, have a better experience and get more users if we first get BitPay or Coinbase to smooth out the rough edges here first.

What if the BTC loan repayment terms include a limit of of what you repay based on the USD/BTC trade value of the BTC? So if the price of BTC spikes dramatically, you owe fewer BTC.

Thanks. I'll point out one more thing:
If the house fee on those gambled coins is 3% per bet then that means 60000 (3% of 2 million) coins were actually spent on gambling at satoshidice.
If the house fee was cut in half from what it currently is, then the number of coins gambled would increase from 2 million to perhaps as much as 4 million, to maintain 60000 coins spent. But notice that the cost remains the same to users.
Also notice that no increase in money supply is needed to sustain this, since users that were betting 1 bitcoin before could just bet the same bitcoin twice as often.
So I don't think the 2 million metric is very useful.

The problem I see here is that **no one (AFAIK) has a good solution for accepting bitcoin in bars yet**.
If I ran a bar, I would find BitPay's current method totally unacceptable.
You need to first get a payment processor to deliver a good system for accepting bitcoins and tips smoothly at a bar, and *then* you can ask bars to accept bitcoins, and tell them to use that system.
In particular, bitcoin payment processors currently lack the ability to natively help a server get a tip without asking the patron what the tip will be.
The way I would do this if I owned a bar, would be to use BitPay or Coinbase to let servers receive Bitcoins, and then have the server leave a laminated card with the servers public address QR code on the table. The customer tips to the address on this card. I would then give the server cash at the end of the night equal to the amount of Bitcoins they received at that address.
(However there is still no service that makes it easy for the bar to implement this.)

A high volume bar can appear under a candle -- but you don't know where most of the volume was traded in that candle!

On the other hand, since the expected number of times they can do this is only once per 4 days, and the max they could steal is whatever is in MtGox's hotwallet, and since they make a lot more money by continuing operations, it's not super concerning to me.
That said, it would make for some really bad press if they decide to close the pool anyway, and go out with a bang (stealing MtGox's hotwallet).

I like your idealism, but not enough people (IMO) are accustomed to using those SI prefixes. So although that may be a better ideal, it will slow adoption.
Also a need for sub-satoshi amounts are maybe 50 years away. Even if the protocol adds many more decimal places, 0.1 and 0.01 satoshis will work for many years after that. Once everyone is already using bitcoin, by all means, switch to SI prefixes.

If the price of a bitcoin goes up, you still would have been better off having 50 bitcoins instead of having less than 50 bitcoins, so you lost money by buying the mining equipment.
In other words, in your situation if you spend 50 coins (worth $1 each) on the mining equipment, and it gives you 40 coins back, then you make $7950 profit.
If you just kept your 50 coins, then you would have $10000.

Property tax, VAT tax (sales tax), tolls (e.g. highway tolls) are examples of taxation that are still easily enforced. 
Even income tax is still enforceable. E.g. corporate reporting will enforce it (your employer claims your wages as an expense, and doesn't want to get audited).
Also look up Fapiao, which is a system that China uses to tax a cash dominated society.
The point is that bitcoin doesn't magically make taxes go away, though it may cause the forms of taxation used to shift.

Many people cannot look at a number that large and determine it is large enough to be theoretically unbreakable off the top of their heads.


Now I wonder if you're being serious. It's the size of the number that we must reason about to answer the question!
To answer the question of whether it can be computed (ever), you need to divide that "incomprehensibly large" number by another incomprehensibly large number (like the amount of computations possible per million years).
Assuming that everyone can eyeball it and determine that we can't bruteforce hashes in that space is arrogant at best.

Well one thing is clear to me: If people feel more secure leaving funds in MtGox, then there will be more open orders. More open orders means more price stability, because the market depth is deeper.
So, it seems to stand to reason that if people can have the same size orders with less money left in MtGox, then there will be higher market depth and higher price stability.
That said, it would help if margin was also paired with incentive to have open orders (like a lower commission rate for orders that are not placed at the market price).
But TLDR, yes I am claiming that it is possible for margin to reduce price volatility.

This was possible because of the chain fork ~15 hours ago caused by unexpected behavior in the 0.8 client.
As far as chargeback potential goes, bitcoin is still ***far*** less prone to chargeback fraud than credit cards or other payment methods, as this is (so far) a once every ~4 years opportunity to do a chargeback (and this chargeback happened within hours -- credit card chargebacks take days or weeks or longer).

The math works in Zimbabwean dollars or any other currency, regardless of devaluation (so long as the value remains positive).
If you purchase mining equipment in Zimbabwean dollars, and it gives you back fewer Zimbabwean dollars than you started with, then you still would have been better off not buying the equipment.
It is pretty simple, I'm not sure where I am failing to explain this to you :/
You seem to think that the rise in price of a bitcoin is somehow going to change your profitability, but the fact remains that if you are ending up with fewer bitcoins as a result of buying the mining equipment, you would have gained even more by having held the coins rather than buying the equipment.
No matter how you slice it, if you spend bitcoins to gain bitcoins back from mining, and you get fewer bitcoins back than you spend, then you lost bitcoins. So no matter what the price of a coin, this was a bad decision in that case.

If Starbucks were to start accepting bitcoins today, they would accept them at 0 confirms. So the transfer time is seconds in cases like these.
In cases where 6 confirmations are important and you want to transfer fast (like depositing to an exchange), this transfer time is faster than the current system typically (compare it to wire transfering dollars).
In other cases, like Amazon shipping you a product, the 6 confirmation time doesn't affect the speed of your order, since they can immediately start processing your order, and cancel shipment in the very unlikely event that you fork the chain before your order is shipped.


It would only slightly speed up transactions. We would then use something like 50 confirmations, instead of 6 confirmations, because blocks would be about 10 times easier to find if they only took 1/10th as long.

That is absolutely false.
I proposed skipping ahead to satoshis years ago and ultimately changed my mind because I realized that they do not have SI symmetry which makes them harder to understand/visualize/work with, and that we are in the same boat again when we subdivide a satoshi.
You are picking satoshis instead of using an SI unit (e.g. 1/1 000 000th of a bitcoin) as the base unit because a satoshi already has a nice name and it happens to be the smallest unit that Satoshi Nakamoto could conveniently fit in with the software tools at hand when using 32 bits.

The concept is that anyone can run the coinlab software on their machine, and run code that someone else is paying them to run.
This means that you have to have standardized functions that the other party can build a program from, so that they can't do anything malicious on your machine, and so that you can have a fixed unit of computation time (like a MH/s type unit).


Oh is that all? :)
My point is that setting up such an environment on random user's computers (which already have GPU mining hardware anyway, which is the whole point of this project) is nontrivial, and a lot more work than many other viable projects, which is why no one has implemented it. It is *not* because no one has thought of this. Many people have, many times over, in the past few years.

That proves absolutely nothing. It doesn't even prove that no one has gotten to them yet.
Think about it, if they have gained the key to that address, and the address has 0.01 coins it it, why would they take the coins and reveal that they can acccess keys like this?
It would be much more profitable to leave the coins there and wait for someone comfortable with keys of that strength to put a sizeable amount of coins into a brainwallet like that.

Bitcoin is relatively simple. You forgot that factor of 10000 more complex/longer open source code (like linux) is kept relatively secure, and that world leading security gurus have reviewed this code (e.g. Dan Kaminsky) and that there is a bounty built in to bitcoin for bug finding.
It's also possible (I personally even think that it's likely) that if a significant amount of money was known to be stolen due a bug in the code, then the version of the chain after the bug theft would be considered invalid, assuming we caught the bug within 24 hours. In other words, we may very well see a majority vote reverse a theft due to a bug.

Ideally, everyone's arguments would stand on merit alone, and the best argument would get the most upvotes.
Unfortunately this doesn't always happen, and it happened more often in the past when posters that were often correct were more well known.
For example, I recently tried to correct the topmost comment in a thread that made a claim about password security. His comment had 12 upvotes and 0 downvotes. Mine had 1 upvote and 2 downvotes. My argument was solid, so this is a situation where people were actually gobbling up the disinformation because my comment was not only ignored, but deemed incorrect by the community.
In an oldschool forum you at least see that someone has 10000 comments or whatever, so you tend to look a little harder at what they have to say when you think they are wrong. It seems like reddit could try to emulate that a little bit. Consider that you can see how many points a stackexchange user has when they answer a question. You don't always care whether they have a lot of points, but if you think they are wrong, you might look a little harder at their answer before you downvote them.

Well, since their commission rate is actually more like 0.9% (because 0.45% is a likely average, and that commission is paid twice, once by the buyer and once by the seller), their commission for the last 30 days is more like $5.33 million.
Multiplied by 12 months that is $63 million.
However, the author didn't mention future revenue, he mentioned *current* revenue.
So you have no correction to offer the author, because current revenue probably is in the $22 million range.
Also even if you are right and they made $35 million this year, the author's $22 million is not that far off.

I like Nicholas Colas but I wish he more forcefully drove home the point that "the guys at bitcoin.org" are *not* the ones policing the 21 million coin limit. I doubt the old skeptical guy understood that in the end.
Whenever I introduce people to bitcoin my first line is always "it is the first digital currency to achieve decentralization, which is a really big deal, because no one has ever been able to do that before".
Everything falls into place after that. Bitcoin has already achieved something that's never been done before. The decentralization and digital combination are the key features that people need to understand about bitcoin before anything else in my opinion.

The question doesn't make sense.
Your electricity bills are paid in fiat, not BTC.
Neither difficulty nor BTC price is going to change the cost of your electricity.
You meant to ask whether $1/GH/s/month would pay your electricity, or something.
BFL equipment is the most efficient available to my knowledge. If they actually ever ship any substantial quantities then the cost to run their equipment is something like:
- 8.6 watts per GH/s.
- Assume $0.15 per KWH.
Then that is about **$1 per month per GH/s**. So $5 per month for a 5GH/s Jalapeno.

Thanks for your analysis, but I think you misworded this final sentence.
Your analysis does not show that the paper is irrelevant, though it does show that the numbers in the original paper are wrong.
Maybe the math in the paper is only a very good approximation, if not 100% perfect. The 25% and 33% numbers might be 26% and 34%, or they may be 48% and 49%. As you pointed out, you don't know the numbers yet:


(My emphasis.)
The paper is not irrelevant nor will it ever be. The paper is important, and we have to be careful not to discourage papers like these.

Yes, so they would *want* an exchange. Not *need*.
The difference is that when you don't *need* an exchange you can have many exchanges for colored coins. Exchange competition. Decentralization.
NYSE is not decentralized at all. Everything on the NYSE is controlled by them. Opening a new stock exchange has an absolutely enormous barrier.
With colored coins, you can have MtGox trading colored coins, and you could have Bitstamp trading the same or different colored coins as well. The same as how bitcoin currently works, except with colored coins representing stock shares.

The block reward would be proportionately smaller, so that bitcoin generation speed is the same on average.


3600 confirmations would take place in the same amount of time as 6 currently take place, on average.
The math for this is tough (litecoin people always seem to get it not quite right) but the number of total confirmations required would be less than 3600, to have the same security as what 6 blocks currently is.
For arguments sake and clarity, lets say it would only be 2000 confirms to have equivalent security to 6 confirms. However 6 confirms is arbitrarily chosen anyway. If block confirm times had less variance, then a smaller number might be chosen right now. Since the OP paper's method would produce way less variance in block confirm times, we would probably choose an even smaller number, let's say 1500. (But again, 2000 and 1500 are not the actual values, they are just placeholders for this discussion due to the difficulty of calculating the actual numbers.)

I didn't say it was linear. I was using the fact that it is very much superlinear.
I said a 10 character password that uses 40 possible characters is 40 times harder to crack than a 9 character password that uses 40 possible characters.
A 9 char password is 40 times harder than an 8 char password.
And so on.
So a 10 char password is 40^9 times harder to crack than a 1 character password.
The fact that is is ***not*** at all linear is what makes it not a significant advantage for the attacker to know that the pass is 10 chars -- cracking the 9 char and lower passwords is only 3% of the work of cracking passwords of length 1 through 10. Thus he is only saving the attacker 3% of the work.

Which blockchain.info already has.
The problem is that the secondary password is typically pretty weak, and can be bruteforced.
For now the solution is to pick a difficult to bruteforce secondary password.
A better longterm solution is for piuk to encrypt the main password instead of storing it in plaintext. Unless your keyboard app is compromised, then there is no keylogging on Android.

Does entering this pin multiple times incorrectly lock your account? Does this app verify the pin with the remote server, or store it locally?
People should still be enabling the secondary password feature on blockchain.info, with a strong password.
The blockchain app will ask you for it when you send coins. The app still stores your main password in plaintext on the phone, so the secondary password is important.

Only if the price has been rising. It is the opposite if the price has been falling.
Log scale compresses higher prices together and spreads lower prices apart.
This makes sense since the purpose of log scale is to allow you to view dramatically different levels of some quantity all in the same chart, which is harder in linear scale.
Mainly my points were:
- log scale can distort the perception of volatility
- log scale is orthogonal to y-scale zooming. You can still zoom in on the y-axis of log scale chart

While it's true that they have too much hash power, this is not a 51% attack.

Current BTC price is not that relevant here. The price of the unit is 2000 BTC. So suppose you pay the full price for it (instead of buying a few tickets).
If you get the BTC for $1 each or $1000 each either way you need the miner to mine more than 2000 BTC for this to make more sense than just buying and holding 2000 BTC. (For simplicity I ignore electricity costs.)

Holding coins and spending coins are not mutually exclusive. 
People who buy coins with the sole intention of keeping them until they sell them for fiat, benefit Bitcoin in at least these ways:
- They have an interest in telling others about how great Bitcoin is (because they want the price to rise). 
- Some of them will spend some coins on stuff now that they have some to spend. 
Telling people not to buy coins (unless they use them in the way you prescribe) is counterproductive. 
Also "the point of Bitcoin" is not to replace fiat. That's just your opinion. Bitcoin has no ideology or goals like that written in the source code. But even if it did, purchases of Bitcoin for any reason would further that cause. 
Also, Bitcoin and litecoin are not very different so if you say that hoarding is a problem for one then it is a problem for the other.

If you try to sell them via credit card or paypal, fraudsters reverse payments to you. This is why no one is able to do that. 
This is one of the things bitcoin does very well -- enabling selling anything without worry of chargebacks. In other words, the problem here is how the old payment systems work.

As has been said so many times before, that should not be a factor in whether you buy mining equipment. If you want to profit from a rise in the price of a coin, then buy coins.

Sigh, they are adding litecoins.
I don't think adding Litecoins to the biggest exchange is going to help Bitcoin's image for newcomers.
**Litecoin is almost exactly the same as Bitcoin and it is cause for a reduction in faith in the value of a bitcoin.**
An almost identical cryptocurrency shouldn't be able to so easily gain so much value -- when it does, it makes people ask "how do I know my bitcoins wont be devalued when Xcoin and Ycoin and Zcoin are added?".

IANAL but it is in fact illegal to offer pre-orders and then use the pre-order money to fund the creation of a product.
They need to keep the pre-order funds on hand for refund at the customer's request.
This is US law and may not apply in every state, but it has been discussed on reddit and various times in the bitcointalk forums, and it was determined that it applies to BFL (Delaware or Missouri corporation).

You can easily make more physical bitcoins, but they wouldn't have actual bitcoin value, unless you assigned bitcoins to them.
That's because a physical bitcoin has a sticker on it with an address and private key.
(By the way, there's no official physical bitcoin maker -- the guy making these is "Mike", some random guy.)
If you manufacture a physical bitcoin, you don't have a bitcoin. You have to write an address on the coin, and put some actual bitcoins there.
In other words, you could just print a piece of paper with an address and key on it, and that would function the same as a physical bitcoin (it would just look less pretty). Actually you can also put a QR code on a piece of paper, and that is even better than a physical bitcoin, for transferring to someone.
The main reason for physical bitcoins in my opinion, is that they are good for giving as gifts to people. It's less fancy to hand someone a piece of paper that says "this is a bitcoin".

ASICs currently have very high initial capital costs and then very low energy costs by comparison to GPUs.
Basically the current state of things is that GPUs are cheap to buy but expensive to run, and ASICs are expensive to buy but cheap to run.
If ASICs do eventually become cheap to buy, and thus many more are bought and power consumption is once again a big concern, then on a large scale Bitcoin mining incentivizes cheap power source generation.
When bitcoin becomes huge, mining becomes a large industry, and it is an industry that would then gain immensely from finding cheaper power sources.
When something like thorium based power (for example) rolls around, this concern is eliminated. In the meantime, ASICs drastically reduce mining power consumption.

That's the best GH/s/KWh possible (it's infinity), but that device is still terrible, because the GH/s/$ is crazy high.
Also at some point density is a problem (what if that device was the size of a house).

Buying bitcoins is certainly *not* the same as shorting the USD.
Bitcoin can fall at the same time that the USD does. The price of a bitcoin and the value of a US dollar empirically have been very decoupled historically. There is virtually no correlation there yet.

I've been thinking about this for a few months now but I keep forgetting to actually do something about it.
Let me try to improve on your concept. You print a piece of paper with NO COINS on it. 
You tip 16% in fiat as usual (so the server doesn't think you're cheap) and then you leave this piece of paper with an additional 3% tip (or whatever, keep in mind the coins might often not be used so you might be able to tip generously here) and you add these coins at the time that you are leaving this paper by sending coins to the public key (printed on the back of the paper, out of the way -- the server doesn't need to care about this QR code).
Now the paper goes like this:
Here's ____ bitcoins worth $_____ at the time of writing this.
To store your new bitcoins:
1. Download a bitcoin app for your phone, such as the Blockchain app (for Android and iPhones).
2. The app might ask you to create a new wallet to store your new bitcoins.
3. Select "import private key"
4. Scan the QR code below:
[QR code for private key here]
You are now the proud owner of these bitcoins. Save them (they'll be worth a lot someday), or spend them! Bitcoins are easier to spend than &lt;some hilarious joke about something really easy to do, or whatever here&gt;.
Find out more at &lt;insert bitcoin introduction site here&gt;.
In fine print:
If you don't transfer these bitcoins to your own wallet within 3 months they will dissappear. Poof!
(On the back of this piece of paper you print the public key that you can use to send coins to this piece of paper before you give this to the server or whoever.)
You let them know that these "expire" in 3 months, so you can keep a copy of the private key and transfer them back to you after ~4 months if they haven't claimed them.

That's what merged mining is for. See Namecoin. You can't merged mine with Scrypt, so you need a whole new set of miners for Litecoin. (That's probably the main reason some of this community wants Litecoin on MtGox in the first place.)
Scrypt has the same advantages and disadvantages as SHA256 in the long term.


As I said, this is a problem that both Bitcoin and Litecoin have. It's not always a problem, and there are solutions.


As I said, there are few situations where this is significantly better. It's only a four fold increase in speed on the first block. You still need a similar number of confirms for the same level of security as Bitcoin.
If you need to wait for a block to pay for something, then Litecoin really has the same problem as Bitcoin. A litecoin block can take a very long time. Paying for something at a brick and mortar store does not work well if you have to wait for 1 block with litecoin or bitcoin.
You're certainly not going to stand at the cashier waiting for a block confirmation.
But most important of all: Litecoin is easy to make and doesn't have any real innovations. 2.5 minute blocks can be done by anyone, its just a small settings change in the Bitcoin source code.

We've never seen bitcoin price behave as it has in the last 60 days. The closest we've seen to this is back in June 2011 when the price hit $30, and the behavior has been very different this time. A much slower rise in price, and three significant corrections (where the price fell at least 10%) where the price quickly recovered from all of them.

Even if you are mining to sell coins at a later date, why would you pay more for coins than you need to?
If mining is not profitable, then you'll get more coins by buying them, vs. spending the same amount of money on mining.
Spend $2000 on mining (plus time and effort) and get 9 coins, or spend $2000 on bitcoins on an exchange, and get 10 coins.
If that is the case, why would you advocate mining?

I have been using bitcoin for a few years now. I have never been ripped off or conned.

There's no reason to think that Coinbase is conning anyone, ripping anyone off, or that they have been hacked, by the way. Coinbase support is aware of the issue, so we'll see if it is resolved simply in the next few days.


I see no more risk of a hack (or almost no more) causing your money to be lost in this exchange with bitcoin than with your traditional financial system.
Deposit $100 into MtGox, buy coins, remove coins immediately, store them in a safe place.
There is little opportunity for a hack to completely prevent you from getting your money.
If they are hacked while they have your $100 (before you buy bitcoins) then this is the same situation as sending $100 to an investment bank -- MtGox or the investment bank would equally suffer from a hack in this situation.

I'm not saying they are right, but they possibly did that because in the global forex market there are cases where you have a currency labelled "USD/CAD" for example, but this does not actually mean that you see the number of USD per CAD.

Yes, and that quote of his is awesome until you realize that when he says "inferior man" he means the Jew.
" The Jews could be put down very plausibly as the most unpleasant race ever heard of. As commonly encountered, they lack many of the qualities that mark the civilized man: courage, dignity, incorruptibility, ease, confidence. They have vanity without pride, voluptuousness without taste, and learning without wisdom. Their fortitude, such as it is, is wasted upon puerile objects, and their charity is mainly a form of display. " -- H. L. Mencken

Even if OP is intent on putting everything into bitcoin, I would still recommend (as I always have) that one should value average in.
Dollar cost averaging (different from value averaging) is a suboptimal strategy (mathematically provably so), though even that would probably make more sense than a lump sum investment here.
*Value averaging*  by the way, goes like this:
(*edit:* Note that this is not dollar cost averaging)
Decide you want to buy $50k worth of coins (as OP has stated that he has).
Now buy in over say, 50 weeks, purchasing once per week.
Purchase as many coins as you need to in order to raise the total value of your coins by $1000 times the number of the week we are on.
So for example on week 1 you buy $1000 worth of coins. On week 2 you buy however many coins you need to raise the total value of your coins to $2000 (buy no coins if value is already over $2000). On week 3 buy however many coins you need to raise the total value of your coins to $3000.
Notice that this strategy buys more coins when the price is low, and less coins when the price is high.

I understand the situation with metric in the US. In Canada, metric was taught without imperial, and now we all use metric -- so *maybe* you have a point, although USD/BTC prices and metric/imperial are very dissimilar.
This isn't just about transitioning from what people know to what they don't, there is a price volatility problem here. You can't price items in bitcoins without having to change the price constantly. USD prices can remain the same for much longer right now, that is just our reality as bitcoin continues to grow.
You will see more businesses adopt bitcoin if you reduce their implementation friction. That means pricing items in what those businesses already have them priced in.

This is a completely different scenario from the one you presented in the OP.
Neither of these companies wants to 51%, because it would destroy the value of their own products.


I've already told you in the past that difficulty is going to increase by a factor of 50x.
Causing GPU miners to bail means gaining an additional 2% lead, which is not a big deal, and will happen in the next few months (if they stay on shipping targets) whether they try to 51% or not.
Also it doesn't sound like you understand what is meaningful about 51%. Getting 51% doesn't make difficulty suddenly increase more or something, it gives you extra authority over the blockchain.


And what would be the point of having all these bitcoins, now that they've destroyed the value of the bitcoin?


Lots of people already have this via the trade API. Lots of people also already have bots set to buy after a price decline. Myself included.

Network hashrate is sticky, and especially sticky downwards (since mining equipment doesn't easily go offline since it is typically a sunk cost).

As I mentioned elsewhere,
I expect volatility to reduce when:
1. the market cap is much higher
2.  exchanges are more robust
3. there is a futures market
4. we can tie a bitcoin to a basket of goods that it can purchase
You address point  but that is not the only way to achieve stability.
And price stability leads to more pricing in bitcoins, which leads to more price stability. Pricing in bitcoins is not really required though.

The real problem is not that merchants cant accept 0 confirm transactions, *it's that people keep writing that merchants can't accept 0-confirm transactions*.
Merchants ***can*** in most cases accept 0-confirm transactions. They are far safer than credit card transactions in most situations.
It's difficult to double spend a 0-conf transaction if the merchant is checking for double spend attempts. Fraud rates with 0-conf transactions would be a fraction of credit card fraud rates.
When this really is a problem though, there are things like green addresses that can be used to safely accept 0-conf transactions.

Keep in mind that they claimed to have venture capital funds long before they accepted any pre-order money.


We'll just have to see how it plays out. However in a situation where they start selling chips before all pre-orders are shipped, would that qualify them for a scammer tag in your opinion?


Why is that important? They are increasing the supply of chips. Are you suggesting that total chip sales will not change at all when butterfly labs starts selling chips? I highly doubt that.


Avalon is not putting a gun to BFL executives heads, and forcing them to sell chips before customer pre-orders are completely shipped (assuming that is what ultimately happens here, though we don't know for sure yet).
BFL has ***already*** secured its profits via pre-order. They don't need to sell chips to be profitable now. They do have an obligation to their customers though, especially if they want them to continue to be future customers.

Only if after 10 months, you stop mining.
If you run the unit for 2 years then the electricity cost is proportionately higher.
At USD 0.13 per kWh:
The electricity cost of a BFL single over 2 years (if they meet power targets) is $134.94.
The electricity cost of an Avalon unit over the same period is $1025.23.
Since the units both only cost $1300, the electricity cost difference could be the difference between positive and negative profits, for those ordering late, if the difficulty skyrockets.

My original comment simply stated that if you zoom in on a chart on the y-scale, you can dramatically increase how much the price moves around on the chart, which can give a sense of volatility even though percentage movements over the entire period could be 0.00001%.
My second bullet point points out that this is also the case in a log scale chart. You can zoom in on a log scale chart just the same as you can on a linear chart.
In general though, you have convinced me and you're right. Since volatility is an expression of percentage movement, log scale preserves the relative appearance of the price movement better.
In fact, I suppose I should really add a log scale rendering to those charts.

I think you are trying to say that BFL could profit by a change in the price of a bitcoin, since they received orders in bitcoins.


No, it's the opposite. They want the price of a coin to rise.
They could profit right now, by returning an amount of bitcoins to customers equal to the original USD value of coins they received which is their current practice anyway). They would profit because the price has risen considerably since they started taking orders.
However, they received USD from bitpay (they paid bitpay for automatic conversion from bitcoins to USD), so this is all a moot point. They couldn't have reliably predicted the massive price increase anyway.

At a world population of 7 billion, there are only 300000 satoshis per person on average.
Apply wealth curves to that and many people would only have a few dozen satoshis.
Grow the world population to 14 billion and there are only a few satoshis for some people, if 100% of their wealth is in bitcoin. If they want to put only 20% of their wealth in bitcoin then they can't even afford 1 satoshi.
This will be a problem longggg before we get to that point though.

Most servers are not going to have their own bitcoin wallet, and a bar owner that is completely new to bitcoin is not going to want to explain to each of their servers how to set up a bitcoin wallet of their own.

My assumption was that he can get BTC as easily as he can get one of these devices. So yes if that's not the case then you have a point there.

No one knows a way to do what you want.
Bitcoin is the first man-made currency to achieve decentralization. It did it with mining.
The 51% attack vulnerability is well understood.


There is no way to impose this rule. There isn't even a way to know if someone has started 51% attacking the network right now, solving blocks but not announcing them. Then when they have a ton of blocks in a row, then announce them all, causing the chain to suddenly fork, and screwing things up.
We have block checkpoints to mitigate this. The last one is at block 210000 I think.

A major correction after a parabolic price hike is totally unsurprising and many people have been predicting this for a while now.
To say that this volatility is "killing bitcoin" is to completely ignore all of the concrete evidence in front of you. Bitcoin is more widespread and stronger than it has ever been, as a result of this volatility.
It is going to take years for the price to stabilize, as is necessary, since bitcoin is still tiny and has a lot of growth ahead. This growth is going to be coupled with volatility, because the price will rise as new people get in.
Gavin (and many others) have been saying that it would be unsurprising to see many bitcoin bubbles over the years. So here was another one (don't forget about $30 in June 2011). I expect to see yet another bubble in the future, but eventually the price will stabilize, as bitcoins become tied to a basket of the goods that it is exchanged for *PLUS* you will get the gold-like stability of just having a very large amount of wealth stored in bitcoin. For this reason, bitcoin can become significantly more stable than gold.

You can view it that way (you are basically saying that the client defines the protocol, regardless of whatever the intended client behavior is).
But note that in this case, the protocol change in 0.8 was still not one that was intended. (A bug in 0.8 caused an unexpected deviation from the 0.7 protocol.)
Some people may view "the protocol" as the high level ruleset that the client is trying to conform to though. In that case, 0.8 did not change the protocol, it just failed to conform to the agreed upon protocol, so reverting to 0.7 is an effort to continue to follow the protocol.

You can buy stuff with zero confirms. In the situation where you need to wait for confirms, 2.5 vs 10 minute blocks doesn't make much of a difference.
But again, yes 2.5 min blocks might be better, but it is not a significant innovation -- its just recompiling the bitcoin source code with some settings changed.

[This chart]( makes me guess that you could easily be looking at 1+ year to ROI if you're in late batch 2. That's about par with many mining operations in the past.

$25 per bitcoin that you mine.

Bitcoin enables possibilities for a marketplace like craigslist that cash does not.
Craigslist has more scammers and risk than it needs to have. Silk Road 2.0 could enable a craigslist-like marketplace that discourages scamming and encourages useful commerce.
Consider this craigslist situation:
Say you're selling speakers for $1000. Someone wants to see them and buy them if they are what you say they are. You are both a 30 minute drive from each other. So he suggests that you meet in the middle, a 15 minute drive away from both of you.
You don't want to drive out there and have him change his mind and you are stuck wasting 40 minutes of your time (15 minute drive there and back, plus 10 minutes to show them to him).
So you use the feature that might be standard/common in a better craigslist -- send $10 worth of coins into escrow, and I will travel to meet you. If you buy the item, you get the coins back. If not, then the coins are distributed to every site user weighted by transaction volume.
This way, people will not waste your time, and you will not try to waste others time.
That was just one example. Bitcoin plus related tech can do a lot for something like craigslist in the long run.

Well yeah, though you are looking at medians, not means. When I wrote my comment I meant "average" to be the "mean", which is in the ballpark of what I wrote :)
The mean net worth is about $262000 per adult US citizen. [Source.]( $16000 is about 6% of $262000.
Anyway, my point is basically the same if you take the median:
If you take that median in the huffingtonpost article of $57000, that makes $16000 about 28% of net worth, and is still not "all eggs in one basket" as HawaiianDry suggested :)
P.S. The fact that there is such a big disparity between mean ($50k) and median ($300k) net worth in America is the reason for all the "1%" talk we've heard about after 2008.

Speaking of not having any idea what is being spoken about, this bitcoin trade is not occurring on the bitcoin network, so that is completely irrelevant.


Because hundreds of transactions per second should be possible, especially given that this is a separate server dedicated to processing trades.

4% is not a *huge* problem though. Imagine if he had 30% instead. I would sell all of my bitcoins if I discovered that Satoshi (somehow) had 30% of all the coins, as would many others. So I don't know why the Ripple people think it's okay.

Not really.
The ASIC user's hashrate is zero if we switch to a different proof of work.
A hard fork creates two chains -- in this case, one with CPU miners and one with ASIC/GPU miners. The ASIC miners will have ***zero*** hash rate on the new chain. The CPU miners will have zero hash rate on the old chain.
Both chains can stay alive.

Don't need to share computation time.
Do bitcoin mining when it is more profitable, do MC simulation when that is more profitable.
So the mining software picks one or the other depending on whether there is MC simulation work available that pays higher than mining currently does.
I guess it still all makes no sense given that mining is switching to ASICs.

My goal is to make it as easy as possible for the average person. Um, do you feel that your system does that? :)


It's slightly less arbitrary actually, since a bitcoin is a base-10 representation of satoshis, and the 21 million cap is not.
Humans currently are used to working with base-10, which is not a totally arbitrary base for us either.
50 years from now when the number of divisions needs to be extended, you can create another arbitrary unit like a satoshi and proceed as we just did, which will last another 100 years.
Or at that point, if you want to start using a more extendable system, you could start educating kids in grade school to use the new system (like the switch from empirical to metric).
Keep in mind that we have no trouble currently using bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, and soon petabytes. Lots of different units. I'm suggesting that we use just 2 for now, and a 3rd in ~50 years.

Purchasing 0.2 bitcoins more would be a big pain, and would take quite some time. So it was worth it to place a bet on satoshidice that would give him the opportunity to make his purchase right away, instead of being forced to lose the purchase opportunity.
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:49:26
It's not the same.
Purchasing from a merchant with coins means:
- the merchant might have to sell coins to pay for their costs as you mentioned, but they do not *have* to sell their profits in BTC
- the merchant perceives bitcoin usage as growing (he is seeing people use bitcoins)
- there is a delay in coins being sold (sometimes a significant one). (So velocity may increase price slightly.)
I am not pressuring him to do anything with his coins, but I am pointing out that he didn't use his coins to purchase something, he just used his coins to increase his fiat holdings so that he could use fiat to purchase something.

This is not what we are discussing, we are talking about price volatility.


We are not talking about the advantages bitcoin offers, we are discussing price volatility.


You asked about the likelyhood of a futures market ever existing. The fact that one exists should tell you that it is... very likely. 


Then you have started arguing about something that I was never intending to discuss in the first place. Your original question was about price volatility.
Very high price stability is not required for bitcoin to function as a payments method, as has been demonstrated for years by the millions in sales on the silk road, for example, or by the fact that Reddit accepts bitcoins for Reddit Gold.
Whether or not Bitcoin becomes a widely accepted method of payment, and whether or not bitcoin becomes a trusted store of value, and whether or not the many possible services that can be implemented on top of the bitcoin protocol are ever implemented, is a separate discussion.
You seem intent on avoiding giving me any credit for providing logical support for what you asked me to provide logical support for, and this conversation is no longer very publicly visible, so I have no intention in trying to carry out a discussion about the viability of Bitcoin in general with you, sorry :)
That said, Bitcoin is not just a currency. It is a protocol that enables services to be built that were never possible before (DIY escrow, smart property, etc.). The internet was also a protocol that enabled new services. Bitcoin might not be as big as the internet, but like the internet, it is very hard to imagine precisely how services built on top of it will look like in 10 years.

Not merge. Replace main chain with your fork before someone else mines a new block.
So you mine on the main chain, and you merged mine a second chain that you have included different transactions into. Then if you fail to mine a 2nd block in a row, you discard both and start over, otherwise you keep building both chains.
If you get a 6 block main chain and a 6 block fork, ...
Nevermind this might work but it doesn't matter because the probability of getting a 6 block main chain and a 6 block merge-mined fork at the same time are tiny.

~~I think that your first solution was right~~, and your new edited solution is not very useful :P
Use the mapping f(x) = (x + 1)*sqrt(-1)
That is a one-to-one and onto mapping from reals to imaginaries, and shows that if reals are countable, then so are imaginaries.
*Edit:* Nah, it isn't, sorry :/


Right, so your new mapping is not one-to-one, and therefore doesn't tell us about the countability.
If you want to show whether the imaginary numbers are countable, you have to find a one-to-one mapping from the imaginary to the naturals. Since I showed (or really, you showed, before the edit) that we have a one-to-one mapping from R-&gt;C, then if there is a one-to-one from R-&gt;N, then there is a one-to-one mapping from C-&gt;N, and then R,C,N are all countable.

~~Log scale creates distortion that biases against volatility in some cases, and biases toward volatility in other cases. Log scale compresses high prices together (making them look less volatile) and spreads lower prices apart (making them look more volatile).~~
*Edit 2:* Actually it seems that you're right, as volatility is an expression of percentage movement, and log scale preserves that locally everywhere. However, your point that log scale is a better way to visualize volatility, doesn't mean that it's wrong to view this chart in linear scale, and it certainly doesn't mean that it's wrong to view the chart with the y axis starting at zero (where would you start the y axis in your log scale chart?)
That also doesn't address the concern of zooming in on the y-axis. You can do that (or not do it) with a log scale graph as well.

I didn't pick on anyone.
I don't understand your position here. All I did originally, was point out that the OP did not use bitcoins to buy something. He used fiat to buy it. I'm not shaming him for this, I am correcting him so that the truth of what happened here is clear.
If you say "I bought a car with bitcoins", how do you expect this subreddit (or anyone really) to interpret that? Do you think that the common interpretation will be that you sold bitcoins and bought a car? Or that you gave bitcoins to someone for a car?
How about "I bought a car with Euros"?
I am not insisting the OP use his coins in any particular way, nor have I ever insisted that anyone use their coins in any way, at any point in the last 4 years of being part of this community.




In response to both of these, Bitpay allows you to select a percentage to auto-convert to fiat. So if your profit margin is 10%, then you could choose say, 95% conversion. 5% remains as bitcoin, the rest is fiat. Half of your profit stayed in bitcoin, half in fiat.

- It doesn't work in the sense that it doesn't increase your gains.
- It ***does*** work in the sense that it reduces your risk exposure to volatility.
Just to get the idea across: If there is, say, a 10% chance that you buy in at $30/BTC and have to wait 2 years to see a positive ROI, then it reduces that 10% chance to say 1% (or more or less depending on chosen length of your averaging). The cost of this is that if there is also a 10% chance that you buy in at $2 and see massive returns, it also reduces the chance of that down to 1% as well.
I highly recommend that you recommend dollar cost averaging  to your friends that want to long term invest into bitcoin -- because they cannot time the market and should not be over-exposed to the possibility of buying during a big price spike.

I don't see why it would.
The value of the coins bet might change, but the percentage payouts of the bet would remain the same.
For example, lets say you and I made a bet 6 months ago about whether Intrade would shut down.
I give you 2:1 odds that Intrade will not shut down in the next year.
You bet 1 bitcoin (putting it into bet escrow), it is worth $10.
So I place 2 bitcoins in escrow, worth $20, in case I lose.
Now here we are 6 months later and Intrade shuts down. So I've lost the bet.
You now get my 2 bitcoins. Sure, those 2 bitcoins are worth more, but so is the 1 bitcoin you put in escrow for the bet. And the bet odds are still 2:1, so everyone looking at the bet still sees the odds of intrade not shutting down as being 2:1, no matter how bitcoin prices fluctuate.
*TLDR:* No.

Actually changes in BTC price do not affect the price of mining equipment very much.
Suppose an ASIC device is priced at 30 BTC today and BTC trades at $150/BTC today.
Tomorrow the price is $200/BTC. Then the same ASIC device is still priced at roughly 30 BTC tomorrow (maybe slightly less since global mining incentive may have now changed).
This is because the number of coins we expect the device to mine hasn't changed (this is mainly affected by difficulty, not BTC price).
That said, ASIC device prices (in BTC) fall as the difficulty continues to increase, since they are expected to mine fewer and fewer coins.

First of all, I strongly object to you making it seem like you should expect to win with martingale . The last thing we need is more bitcoin users wasting money on gambling because they thought they found a winning system.
Second, your logic is wrong.
~~You can't send a satoshi to just dice without paying a fee, and the max bet is lower than what you suggest.~~
Even if you could though, you are suggesting that the max bet is 2^34 times your original bet.
Starting with 1 satoshi, this means your max bet would be 17179869184 satoshis, or 171 BTC, which is higher than the max bet at Just-Dice, of 167.7 BTC.
It also means that you would potentially have to risk 171 BTC to gain 1 satoshi.
~~But again, this doesn't work even if the max bet allowed is 171 BTC, because you can't send 1 satoshi without a fee, and have it included in a block by the miners.~~
*Edit:* Removed parts about sending 1 satoshi. At least Just-Dice reduces chain spam, apparently :)

If you change your client software to follow different rules, then you orphan yourself from the network, because all other bitcoin clients reject your rules.

It won't happen because if you 51% the network, then you destroy the value of the equipment you bought to 51% in the first place.
Apart from that, in the short term:
After ASICs, there is no other big technology that can be used to make another big mining jump (like the jump from CPU to GPU, or GPU to ASIC), and Avalon has a 3 per customer limit per batch. So if we survive ASICs (looks like we will due to competing firms and firms like Avalon being interested in avoiding a 51%, and the incentive I mentioned earlier), then we're fine for a long time.

I know. You can still measure in terms of the cost of the item in bitcoins. A $150 miner when a bitcoin is $6 costs the equivalent of 25 bitcoins.
This is an effective way to evaluate whether buying coins or buying mining equipment was a better choice.


Measuring returns and costs in bitcoins removes the need to pay any attention to the price of a bitcoin (or a dollar). If the mining device mined more coins than it cost, then it was a better choice to buy the miner than to buy coins. If not, then buying coins would have been a better choice.
You can measure in terms of dollars if you wish, but if your goal is to determine whether buying coins or buying mining equipment was the optimal choice, then I hope you see that measuring in terms of bitcoins makes this easier than measuring in dollars.

We do.
Email passwords are hashed using something like SHA-256 before they are stored.
Or if you mean, why don't we do email like we do bitcoin (being able to send to any email address possibly before someone even has access to it, and so on), then some of the reasons are:
- No one thought of how to do things like bitcoin until pretty recently (shortly before bitcoin existed).
- Bitcoin addresses are messy, unlike email addresses (that you can choose). There might be a solution to this but it isn't obvious.
- To do things the bitcoin way, you need to store a lot of data for emails on many computers, and a centralized model is simpler and more efficient.
That said, there could be a benefit to a decentralized email system, but I'm not sure if it outweighs the costs.

No. Just buy at consistent intervals over a long period of time. Dollar cost average in.
E.g. you have $2000 to spend on bitcoins. So buy $100 worth every week for 20 weeks. You will avoid any market events that prevent you from taking advantage of bitcoin's positive year over year performance. It's been up every single January (*every single year since inception!*) compared to the previous January and you only get burned if you put it all it at a local high -- so that's why you dollar cost average in.

This has been discussed a great many times. I even proposed this myself 1-2 years ago.
I eventually decided that this is not a good idea mainly because 100M satoshis = 1 BTC, so it is messy, but also because when we subdivide a satoshi into smaller units we face the same problem all over again.
mBTC, uBTC, ... scales forever. Your solution does not.
1000 mBTC = 1 bitcoin.
Is this really so much simpler than 100M satoshis = 1 bitcoin?
**If you want to skip ahead, why not make a name for the uBTC, and skip to THAT instead of satoshis?**
This solves the problem of the awkward 100M satoshi = 1 BTC issue. It also solves the problem of scalability. *And* it solves the problem that you are trying to solve, namely that people aren't as familiar with the SI prefixes for numbers smaller than one, as they are with the SI prefixes for large numbers.
1M uBTC = 1 bitcoin.
A uBTC is also called a microbit.
1M microbits = 1 bitcoin.
0.1M microbits = 0.1 bitcoins.
100K microbits = 0.1 bitcoins.
Simpler than:
100M satoshis = 1 bitcoin
10M satoshis = 0.1 bitcoins
1M satoshis = 0.01 bitcoins
Also notice that microbits (uBTC) fit into the already existing SI prefixes (m, u, ...) for bitcoins so this will scale forever and not confuse anyone. You can even talk about satoshis in terms of microbits easily:
1 satoshi = 0.01 uBTC

In the case where they receive fiat from the customer, it is harder to get coins, and they have to pay a fee to get them.
You missed the point anyway. I was saying that merchants that accept coins do not always sell all their coins for fiat.


Support load for the merchant will be lower overall because of no chargeback capacity. Sure, when something gets mishandled there is support load. That doesn't mean that there is more mishandling due to using bitcoins. If something is mishandled with fiat, there is support load too. When there is a fiat chargeback, there is support load due to that as well.


This is only a problem in some countries. E.g. it is not an issue in Canada.
Anyways your posts miss the point, which is simply that the OP did not use Bitcoins to buy something. He used fiat to buy something.

Yes, a satoshi is as arbitrary a unit as a bitcoin, but a satoshi is not permanently the smallest unit.
I am dumbfounded that you think it would be easier to move forward by removing a *bitcoin* as the default unit. Everyone that has even just heard of Bitcoin understands that a bitcoin is the unit of our currency -- it is very intuitive.
The bitcoin is the unit that is fixed, more zeros might come after it, making the satoshi as the base unit obsolete, and then what?
Please understand that I *do* want a smaller base unit. I just want the base unit to be a microbit, instead of a satoshi, because this solves problems that using the awkward value of a satoshi has if you still want to be able to also talk about bitcoins as a unit.
For example the price right now is about $0.61 for 1k microbits.
@_date: 2013-11-02 05:19:00
I started proposing this years ago but I stopped when I realized that if we increase the divisibility of a bitcoin then you wind up with the same problem that we have right now when you want to start talking about 0.001 satoshis.
It's better to just use the metric system for fractions of a bitcoin.
100M satoshi = 1 bitcoin is also not ideal, as it doesn't scale well or have symmetry.
1000 millibit = 1 bitcoin.
1000 microbits = 1 millibit.
This will scale the best going forward, and accomodates for adding a unit smaller than a satoshi in the future.

At that point you could still purchase a few thousand dollars worth of mining equipment and mine a block in 90 days again though (if any of several ASIC companies deliver one of their new products).
I did mention that 90 days is just ballpark due to the wildly changing diff. Even a 1 year wait is not terribly bad. Buy more mining equipment so that it takes as short a time as you need. The scenario in question is that the bounty address has a *lot* of coins in it. If it didn't, publishing this information wouldn't be worth it even if you didn't have to mine a block anyway. 
@_date: 2013-09-13 12:49:54
It's actually pretty easy to mine a block yourself, if you're willing to wait a bit, and have a few thousand dollars worth of mining equipment.
One BFL SC single (50GH/s) for example mines a block roughly once per 90 days on average (just ballpark though, since diff is rapidly changing).
So if you have $3000 worth of mining equipment, and can wait a few months for this, then you will be fine.

I think presenting Bitcoin as something that could be a part of these worlds probably makes it attractive to anyone who has seen Firefly or Cowboy Bebop.

The easiest way to fix your problem is to way a day for your transaction to drop out of the memory pool, and then you'll be able to resend.
If you try to resend now you would have some trouble getting it relayed anyway, because all nodes see those transactions as having been spent.
Getting a pool to manually add your transaction will be pretty tough.

That method is already how the payment handling process is done for sites that use paypal anyway. (You integrate your site with the paypal API, so why can't you integrate your site with the bitpay API?)
BitPay then generates a 3rd party receipt for you which is handy by itself as well (customers will feel more comfortable knowing they can provide proof of payment to you).
Even if you didn't do this, you could always just sell BTC received at the end of every business day, and the level of stability we've seen in the past 10 days would be fine.

What if the units tend to die after 6 months?
Or if difficulty increases by a factor of 100 and the price of a bitcoin falls by a factor of 5, then ROI time could be many years. At which point you may never pay the unit off.
Of course price could continue to rise, difficulty could increase slower than expected, and you could pay the unit off in a few months -- that's also possible.

*Edit:* 
You can downvote this comment all day, but it's staying because I'm confident about this: the addition of litecoin to MtGox hurts bitcoin.
One of the points of debate that commonly arises when selling bitcoin to someone is that many altcoins can be created that will reduce Bitcoin's value. My typical response is that they will only take off if they are significantly different from bitcoin, because bitcoin has a huge first mover advantage. Yet here we have litecoin, which is *almost* ***identical*** to Bitcoin, and it is gaining significant value. That is going to scare people away.
I'm not against altcoins in general, but MtGox's endorsement of Litecoin in particular is bad for Bitcoin.

I wasn't saying they had the same volatility (although they actually do not have drastically different volatility in this case).
Read the title of this thread. The OP thinks the price movements in his graph are crazy volatile, when in fact they only appear that way because the chart is scaled in so much. If the price were more volatile, the scale might increase, and the OP might have actually thought that the price movements were *less* volatile!
The difference between the high and the low in the OP's chart is only 1.5%.
The difference between the high and low in the USDEURO chart is 0.8%. Better, but not THAT much better.
Anyway, that's really besides the point here.

I used to offer the [Ferroh Mining Contract]( (I offered this service in January 2012.)
I assume this is the type of service you're asking about.
I did it because it allowed me to safely buy a very large amount of mining equipment at a low risk.
It turns out that mining myself and not offering the contract would have provided me with a much larger profit, but the risk still would have been much higher.
Both myself and the contract purchasers profited (though it didn't have to end this way, they could have lost out). I gained a reduced risk. They gained a return on investment without having to do any other work.
When you sell someone a mining contract, you get all the funds up front that you need to pay for equipment and labor, and you are guaranteed to have this amount. You can then focus on operating an efficient farm, and not worry much about price and difficulty fluctuations (you only care if operating profit goes negative, in which case you shut off your rigs).

I can't accurately guess the odds without knowing more about what you are selling.
If someone can buy what you're selling anonymously with no penalty for getting caught doublespending from you, then you will get doublespent often. The odds for a determined attacker that is not penalized for doublespending are probably above 90% for a successful attack, though you can reduce them to about 50% by listening to the network for multiple spends, and waiting a minute or two.
In many cases it is easy to prevent it from being worth it for an attacker to do this though. Starbucks would not probably not have to do anything to prevent 0-confirm doublespends for example.

Not really. Holding value is something that bitcoin does well.
One feature of bitcoin is that it offers an alternative to (for example) Swiss bank accounts. There's nothing wrong with buying bitcoin for the purpose of storing value.
More importantly, you seem to want bitcoin acceptance to grow, but telling people not to buy it is not likely to help that happen.
If someone buys a large amount of bitcoins for the purpose of selling later, that person is likely to tell others about it, and is infinitely more likely to spend some coins on something in the bitcoin economy than if they had never bought any coins at all.

I think you're confusing me with someone else?
Also it was satirical. Selling just because silk road is not making 4x the monthly profits as it achieved on average last year is (I think fairly obviously?) a pretty silly reason to sell.
But more importantly: When people tell you to sell, it is not actually a sell signal. More often, a better sell signal is when everyone is telling you to buy, or saying they have bought in. This is often an indication that buyers money is thin.
Think about it: If you have lots of people saying "SELL NAO!!" then those people have *already* sold. This means that there is less bearish money to be placed on the market at the current price.
*TLDR:* If you get mad when someone says "SELL", you're doing it wrong.

When you create an address offline, what you're doing is creating a public address, and a corresponding private key that unlocks funds in that address for spending.
You can now send coins online to the address. This means you broadcast to the network a message that says that coins are to be sent to that address, and a record is put into the blockchain that the coins are now at that address.


Yes, it is.
The network doesn't care if there is a machine online that can access that public address.
So one day, when you turn on your computer (or any computer) that has a private key to the address you created, you can now broadcast to the network a message that says "move coins from this address to some other address", using your private key.

No, the ounces cancelled out. Look at my earlier example.
If the price of silver stays the same (in any denomination), then when the price of a bitcoin reaches about $64000, the market cap of silver and bitcoin will be equal.
I showed this using the following calculation:
    (45 billion oz * $30/oz)/21M = $64285 / bitcoin
Notice that both ounces and the number of coins are used, but it doesn't matter, because the ounces cancel out.


Again, I've already shown it :) $64k/bitcoin makes bitcoin and silver market caps equal.


This would only change the number of dollars per bitcoin demi-dozen to make the market caps equal. But why would that be better than expressing it in terms of price per bitcoin?

It tells you very little.
Bitcoin price has increased drastically vs anything even a little bit stable, in the fast few months.
If the price of gold increased by 10% in the past month, and the price of a bitcoin increased by 100%, then bitcoin would have beaten gold by a large margin. So would this tell you? Bitcoin is tiny compared to gold. If the price of gold went up 10% in a month, then I would say that the gold market is doing extremely well. Gold is not a penny stock, like bitcoin.
Bitcoin has a very shallow market depth, and a tiny market cap compared to gold. A single person could cause a 1000% price increase in bitcoin, if the right person so desired.

I don't understand why people struggle to understand the mining profitability in BTC argument.
Look, you will make more dollars if you determine the profitability is positive in BTC.
- If a miner has a negative profit in BTC,  and the miner is profitable in dollars, then you would have made more dollars by buying bitcoins instead of buying a miner!
- If a miner has a negative profit in BTC,  and the miner is not profitable in dollars, then have lost dollars by buying a miner!
*So as you can see, no matter what, if the miner is not profitable in BTC, then it is not worth buying.* It doesn't matter if it was originally priced in euros or gold or dollars.
Or to put it another way, if a miner needs the price of bitcoin to rise in order for it to profit, then if the price of bitcoin stays the same, then you will lose money (DOLLARS) if you buy that miner. If the price of bitcoin does rise and the miner is profitable in dollars, guess what, you would have been even more profitable if you had just bought bitcoins! All you really did by buying that miner is buy bitcoins at a premium.

Yes, however the reason it might add to the confusion is that the person we're arguing with thinks that the creator has special powers because he created Bitcoin.

That is not *at all* what I'm proposing. Maybe this misunderstanding is why I've been getting downvotes.
I am saying we should pick uB as the base unit, instead of satoshis as the base unit.
uB is short for uBTC, which is a microbit -- one millionth of a bitcoin.
The price is currently $0.60 for 1000 microbits.
The uB solves all of the problems you want to solve AND solves SI problems, and pleases the SI purists far more than satoshi does, and scales when we divide a satoshi up, and it plays nicely with a bitcoin as the currency unit because:
1 million microbits = 1 bitcoin.

This thread is silly.
Measuring silver in ounces is somewhat arbitrary. You could measure silver in some other denomination like grams or grains.
Silver is $840 per gram. Uh oh, we're not at parity anymore because I measured silver in grams!
Bitcoins could have been divided into 31 million instead of 21 million, or any other number. That would also remove parity.
For a bitcoin to be worth the same as an ounce of silver, we essentially need the price of a bitcoin to be $64000.
Why? Because there are 45 billion ounces of silver, and they are $30 each.
So there are $1350 billion USD worth of silver (this is the market cap of silver).
That's $1350B / 21 million bitcoins = $64280/bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-10-27 03:45:32


Well, yes, you probably couldn't. That's because it's the harder wallets that have less incentive to be swiped immediately, because those are the ones where swiping them gives away that complex wallets *can* be swiped.
It's not about some secret cabal of hackers. It's that the guy who is taking the time to follow complex rules to generate a key needs to gain a higher amount of coins from a wallet for it to be worth it, because the amount of time it takes to generate such a key is orders of magnitude higher.
Again it's not about *waiting* in the sense that there is some time delay, it's that there is a threshold amount that makes it worthwhile to take the coins from the found brainwallet. Taking a few satoshis generates less expected profit than seeing if the address will have more coins in the future.

I've seen 0.1 BTC payments get delayed for hours because there was no fee included.
It can especially be a problem when the payment is sent from MtGox. Miners get to choose which transactions are included, it's not just about space in the blockchain. Some miners simply don't relay transactions from MtGox IP addresses.
Back in the day there was a time when you could sometimes wait *days* for your transaction from MtGox to be included in a block, and MtGox solved this by working with pool operators.

I think it's just the opposite. It's better if they under-represent the price so that people are surprised to see that the price is even higher than they expected when they check.
It also protects against a situation where they check the price and it has fallen several dollars from what you said it was.

My point is that this price parity is meaningless. Why do we have a whole thread about it?


There are many people in this thread that have interpreted price parity of an ounce of silver to a bitcoin as indicating that the value of bitcoin is equal to the value of silver.
This is not the case.
Price parity is totally arbitrary here, because the denominations chosen are arbitrary.

I meant to say, you can use a 64 bit float to represent a bitcoin.
So if you perform operations on these floats you don't have to worry about precision problems changing how many satoshis a user has, because the smallest unit of a bitcoin is not too small.
Also, satoshi did use floating point in the client originally, even if that has been changed now. And Satoshi is the one who decided on 100 million units so... :)

Well, to answer your question, essentially:
No bitcoin has ever been counterfeited.
And, it's likely that no bitcoin will ever be counterfeited -- though it depends exactly what you mean by "counterfeited".
It is possible to make someone think they received a bitcoin from you, but then the transaction will reverse after a few minutes (sometimes called a double spend attack). However this is very difficult to do, and you can always avoid this by just waiting an hour before accepting any transaction from someone that you don't trust.

7 blocks/hour is 0.47 blocks per 4 minutes.
Use this Poisson distribution calculator:
Random variable is 4 (number of events to occur in 4 minute period).
Average rate is 0.47 (expected blocks found per 4 minute period).
So the calculator tells us that cumulative probability P(X &gt; 4) is 0.000129.
1/0.000129 = 7752. So once every 7752 four minute periods 4 or more blocks are found.
Converting 7752 four minute periods to days:
(7754*4)/60/24 = 22 days.
So the event occurs once per 22 days on average.

They had a timer that counted down to their mining launch, which reached zero today.
After the timer hit zero, there was an update on IRC stating that they just needed "a few more minutes". They were supposed to be publicly mining at this point, and they weren't (and still are not).
Then labcoin posted an update on bitcointalk saying that they decided not to mine publicly because they didn't want ASICminer-like drama if their hashrate fell.
They also posted pictures of their boards that many users feel aren't convincing due to the unusual PCB layout:
It's not just "heavy trolling" as seems to suggest.

**Whether it is illegal doesn't affect any of the statements I made**, so what is your problem?
**The site is a probable scam** regardless of whether it is legal or illegal to sell the receivers -- the fact that legality is irrelevant is why I made the statement about not knowing for sure whether it is illegal.
Also, **selling a lower receiver is the equivalent of selling a firearm** -- not just "a hunk of metal in the eyes of the law". That doesn't make it illegal to sell, but you need to follow the same rules as when selling a firearm. It could be that the OP site is not selling fully completed lower receivers though or something like that to avoid this law.

- The price will stabilize for the same reason that the price of gold is much more stable than the price of a bitcoin.
- The price will become even more stable than that as the price becomes tied to a bundle of goods that you can purchase with bitcoins.
- The volatility of the price in the meantime is managed by setting prices in USD and letting payment processors convert between BTC/USD on the fly.
- The volatility of the price will also be managed by a futures market and the ability to short, neither of which are currently really available for Bitcoin.
- Your idea of "BTC 2.0" doesn't actually propose a solution to anything.

The way these things work is that an elegant solution is proposed first. Then it is discussed, then problems are ironed out, and the idea becomes robust. Then when you present this idea to exchanges (or whomever), they accept it.
You can email exchanges if you want, but if we all email different flawed ideas then the exchanges implement nothing, or they implement different things and we have a mess.

Because the problem we are solving is how best to represent smaller amounts of bitcoins.
I am proposing the same solution as the OP, except that we choose uB as the base unit instead of a satoshi.
Satoshis do not have SI symmetry, while uBTC (uB for short) does.
So uB is a better base unit than a satoshi. It is also backwards compatible with the use of mBTC and uBTC by the way, and forwards compatible with the use of nBTC as a unit after we inevitably subdivide satoshis.

"You can't predict the future with 100% accuracy therefore everything you say is useless."
No one knows what difficulty will be, that doesn't mean you can't form a model for what the expected range is, so that you can decide whether you should invest or not.
Consider that options are priced using Black-Scholes for example, based on the current price. Black-Scholes doesn't predict the future, it just gives you a reasonable probability estimate that you can start from.
Also, my arguments about why $2/day is not a good minimum are not based just on the current price.

Also, it's not even certain that 2.5 minute blocks are better (though I personally would guess that 2.5 minutes is better than 10 minutes). Long block times were chosen so that very high latency is tolerable.

Well the fact that the price can't be negative should tell you that something is wrong with your reasoning :)
The fall is nonlinear. No one can tell you exactly what will happen to the price any better than they can tell you what the price will be tomorrow, but I think it's safe to say that selling 40k BTC into a market with ~12000k BTC total is not going to crash the price to zero.

That would be illegal for them to do (accept pre-order money to fund the creation of the units) so no, they would definitely be in the scammer category in that situation. Remember, they claimed to have everything funded via venture capital.

Merchant still uses phone to see transaction, but doesn't have to open phone to let customer start paying. 
So customer can start paying as soon as they see the QR code beside the register, and merchant can pull out phone while that's happening, and merchant is ready at about the same time that customer is finishing sending coins. 
Compare that with the customer having to wait for the merchant to pull out their phone (and enter the amount into bitpay) before even starting to be able to send payment.

Take the island example.
Placing just a single 0.1 BTC bet, the expected return is +4799996%.
You could use martingale to greatly improve odds of getting 0.1 BTC (since you have 0.9 BTC to bet), but lets keep it simple and say that you just bet 0.1 BTC once. 48% win chance, 52% lose chance.
If you win (with probability 0.48), you gain 10000.1 BTC.
If you lose, (with probability 0.52), you lose 0.1 BTC.
So expected return on your 0.1 BTC bet is  
10000.1 BTC * 0.48 + (-0.1 BTC) * 0.52 = +4799.996 BTC  
which is a +4799996% return.

Payment is instant. High security confirmation is slow.
If you are ordering something to be shipped next business day (or even this business day), confirmation time is totally irrelevant to you as the buyer.
For the customer paying, the measure of payment speed is only affected by confirmation time when it actually delays the receipt of the goods. Paypal doesn't let you buy many things that would be affected by this anyway.

The 3% fee on cavirtex (lower for higher volume users) prevents arbitrage as well.
Using some conservative fees:

Now add the fees to deposit/withdraw at cavirtex and mtgox.

Mining devices are currently priced at about an equivalent of $15 for 5 GH/s ($60 for 20GH/s). The speed of the competition is what determines whether you will be profitable.

He's likely wrong because:
- A hard fork like that would be the biggest change via fork Bitcoin has ever seen.
- It would take a lot of time to find agreement among users about what the implemented change should be and whether it should be made at all.
- There will be a lot of resistance from Bitcoin users who simply do not like to see the Bitcoin protocol change at all, unless absolutely necessary (because change in the protocol challenges confidence). Also thousands of vocal Bitcoin users are invested in ASICs and would not want to see this change.
- Recently we have not even been discussing the possibility of such a hard fork in the near future seriously, yet Kaminsky is predicting that the fork will be fully implemented within the next 7 months? That is extremely far fetched.
- How can Kaminsky possibly claim to know ***with certainty*** what thousands of miners will choose to do, especially in such a short time frame?
Note that I am saying he is wrong about the timeline. I'm not saying we can't or won't change the proof of work.

However storing your seed encrypted online is the same as storing your brainwallet password encrypted online, though that may be redundant.
The actually interesting part of brainwallets IMO is really the deterministic generation of all keys from a seed key (which can be a phrase, or not). So you can have ONE key that unlocks all your addresses, and generates all your future addresses too.
Making this a random bunch of characters, and then encrypting that in the cloud might be more secure than memorizing a phrase -- unless you choose the phrase very well.

That's not my point.
