i suppose that leads to follow up q. is this still on testnet or mainnet? assumed mainnet since i was able to buy real merch -- that seemed kinda dope 
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:28:15
no i havent. and thanks. where can i test? is there an easy testnet link for lightning. would love to play around with it and get confortable enough to use in real world.

assuming it'll work just fine, but just checking...

Lots of competition in the space. I'm expecting to see several others get a bit hasty in launching. Crunch time now. Will be fun to see the look on friends faces when paying at a place that "doesn't accept btc"
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:03:23
also, the first he had heard of bitcoin was earlier in the day - clueless on what he was referencing :)

Coinbase's recent integration with Mint.com (owned by Intuit) has helped me turn a few folks. Having Bitcoin shown side by side with my 401k, Ira, Bank accounts, etc. in USD seemed to legitimize it a bit...
@_date: 2014-09-23 05:34:52
a bit over my head technically but sounds interesting
@_date: 2014-01-16 01:04:33
I have a buddy who is in the exact same boat as you are (submitted everything around the same time). I submitted everything on 11/1 and was not verified until 11/25 but received all the same time estimates you mention. I think you are still okay as I got in just before the volume really increased. I'm assuming they are still way backlogged and doesn't seem to be much of a priority there - I do most of my trading now on btc-e now

CAN'T WAIT! I have a feeling this will burn a hole in my bitcoin wallet...
@_date: 2014-01-15 00:51:29
Love these. I'd snag all three
@_date: 2014-01-25 02:26:20
Glad you brought this up. I have been doing this manually for a while and have been a bit annoyed by the "why spend your bitcoin when the price is on the way up" argument.
@_date: 2014-04-27 06:19:43
I'm not sure the exact process honestly. We go thru Coinbase - I'll update tomorrow. My first assumption is that $ equivalent is refunded in the method of our choice at time of refund transaction.

I sent a small amount of to a friend of mine so they could play around and get comfortable. He has been waiting since early december and our BTC is still in handcuffs. Just got back to him 2-3 days ago with ~"Accounts are verified in the order in which they were received". I know thats not much help but at least you're not the only one...

Just started this class and even though i'm not a developer, it is immensely helpful and fairly easy to understand and follow along with...

good stuff I have been buying like 10 bucks worth every morning for a while. it helps to even out the price you get it at - not nearly as concerned with ups and downs
@_date: 2014-01-15 09:49:09
Thank you for mentioning this. I don't understand why more people don't get this concept. Seems obvious.
@_date: 2014-04-27 04:21:37
whoops - uploaded the wrong screenshot...
@_date: 2014-06-18 17:16:58
it works. i believe they added a level of security so you have to reconnect the API

[would be a good place to start
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:44:13
 
This is a good start but is not all inclusive
@_date: 2014-01-25 02:27:15
I think this could be fairly easy to implement for Coinbase (kinda the same idea as recurring buys)

if we are rooting for adoption then whether or not you like apple, it has to happen. but agreed. the war is altogether obnoxious

Sorry I missed your main reason comment all along. Realizing that I made it appear that big brands are paying in crypto. They are not (even tho they have the ability to). Point of post was to say that we have been accepting bitcoin for quite some time and as an enthusiast, I was pumped to be at a place the joined the movement so early. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 06:14:57
 bitcoin selected :)

"Reason For Selling
I'm rather swamped with my full-time work and want to hand this off to someone who can take the reigns. It's a beautiful site and I feel it could have a lot of potential in the right hands. 
Thanks for reading,

godaddy - auto-promo kicked in. was a pleasant surprise 
@_date: 2015-01-22 07:49:14
Looks like they just hung it up and tried to sell the site and assets on Flippa (unsuccessfully).
@_date: 2015-01-17 07:42:03
ha, looked at that too. silkgox.com at $.99 had a nicer ring to it :)

APOPO.org uses highly trained African Rats to sniff out and remove landmines in post-conflict areas and detect Tuberculosis in developing countries. Thought this was a joke at first glance but pretty cool cause. Donated with Bitcoin yesterday.

Currently two 17 year olds lead funded Bitcoin startups. 
Jamie Young (CEO at pavilion.io)
Louison Dumont (CEO at bitproof.io)
Can hardly contain how exciting has been to watch develop. Future is bright.

I've been on the beta for a couple weeks now. Great so far. Team is badass
