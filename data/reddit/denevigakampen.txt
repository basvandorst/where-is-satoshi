futures obviously have very little effect on the bitcoin price, the volume being traded is very small compared to the volume being traded on exchanges. Thinking that the closing dates of the bitcoin futures will have a major impact on the price is a good indicator that you're financially illiterate. Just like with any other futures, they just roll over unto the next month contract without any obvious movements as that would facilitate arbitrage.

Not necessarily, no. There does not "have" to be a bust at all, and it certainly doesn't have to be for those reasons at all.

Those are separate questions. Yes it's still true for highly volatile assets. Price swings of 10% without news are just because the markets are so imperfect and trade on psychology rather than fundamentals (in the short-medium term. Nobody can escape fundamentals in the long term).

Yes it has been averaging around that in modern history, but that doesn't mean there's a crisis every 7-8 years, just the average. Every point is independent from the other. Since you're making this statement I'm assuming you have no history in statistics or finance, so an easy parallel to the real world would be for example a dice. You strike a 6 on a dice 1/6 times. However, that doesn't mean that if you've struck the dice 5 times and there has yet to be a 6, that the likelihood of the next strike will be 6 has increased. Finance is like that, the likelihood of a crash right now is not higher just because the market has risen the last couple of years.

You guys WANT bitcoin to be "the internet" and not "pets.com", but the truth is that nobody knows. It doesn't become true  just because everyone in this echo chamber reiterates it to sleep better. I'm mastering in computer science and finance, and with a considerable amount of time spent trying to learn exactly how bitcoin works under the hood, I am at least personally of the opinion that it's by no means guaranteed that bitcoin will succeed down the line. It could very well be another altcoin, it could very well be that finance just takes the best part of the blockchain and uses that technology, either way, it's by no means sure that bitcoin will be this valueable in 10+ years time.

No 5% is about normal. 1-2% is average for companies with a lot of growth, ie expectations that dividend levels will rise in the future. The reason that only utility companies have around 5% dividend is that that sector generally lacks growth.
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:01:45
Haha what? I am literally not in any sense incorrect. A normal dividend level is 5%. Exceptions are made for growth companies. It's actually a little bit ridicilous that you call yourself EconMan but have no idea about this. Do you even work with economics/valuation?
@_date: 2018-05-18 12:59:45
Yes, but the thing that you're missing is that higher adoption is already priced in. Bitcoin would be ridicilously overpriced at current levels if you only looked at the current usage. It's very very hard to defend the current valuation without making some outlandish claims about future adoption rate.
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:32:33
I own nothing but I've been shorting bitcoin a lot since I saw this huge bubble forming, so that's why I'm here, to pick up on the general sentiment.
@_date: 2018-05-19 09:12:46
No you are wrong. S&amp;P contains a lot of growth companies which is why the dividend is lower. For mature/non-growing companies, 5% dividend IS normal.
@_date: 2018-05-18 22:26:07
It is the only reason ultimately. If you think growth etc is important then you're not thinking clearly, as the only reason that growth companies rise in value is the expectaction that they will be able to pay good dividends in the future with all that growth. It's all about dividends in the end.

@_date: 2018-05-20 18:34:24
Look you autist, I could have said that 5% is normal for mature companies, for companies with good dividend growth the valuation is obv gonna be higher to account for the growth as there would be a massive imbalance otherwise, but this is fucking people have a hard time clothing themselves in the morning as it is, so I kept it simple. I know it's hard being autistic, but normal people can infer what I meant by the setting without going off on a tangent on some technicality.
Second of all I'm not american so I don't know any american indexes but sectorwise utilities/banks and things like this that don't grow much tend to be around 5% dividend. I'm sure you can look it up and see for yourself.
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:24:59
Simple - it does not produce value. Same reason he doesn't invest in gold, oil or corn, but instead companies that actually make a profit each year. The only way to earn money on non-producing assets such as bitcoin is hoping some fool with come along later and buy it for a higher price.
@_date: 2018-05-18 12:53:06
Haha what? My post is literally just facts, you can ask anyone with an economics degree and they'll tell you that this is basic shit. It IS scary that you guys don't know the difference between value producing assets and commodities. This is so I expect extremely little from you guys, but still, come on.
I believe in free speech lol, that's quite the hyperbole to extrapolate that from my first sentence!
No not all stocks pay dividend. Yet every valuation model of every stock seeks to sum up all future dividends and calculate what those dividends would be worth today. If you knew with 100% certinty a company would never give dividend, then that company would be worth zero, regardless of how much profit it makes. Once again, scary that you don't know this.
@_date: 2018-05-17 20:58:28

No and it's scary that you are illiterate enough to voice that opinion. You should read up some more about stocks/commodities etc before investing, just some advice.
The difference is that companies make money, and they pay a dividend. A pretty normal dividend level is around 5% of the company market cap. So if a stock costs 100$, they'll probably leave a dividend of around 5$ each year. That means that even if you are unable to find a buyer for your stocks, they won't be worthless, they'll still pay 5$ each year. And even if the stock price falls to 50$, then you'll get 10% dividend each year (5$/50$), and for that kind of return you'ld be happy to buy more. This is the difference to bitcoin. If bitcoin falls 50%, it has fallen 50% and you have strictly lost 50%. And if you don't find a buyer, well yeah then you haven't found a buyer and bitcoin will not do anything for you. And if the bitcoin price stays the same for 5 years, you haven't made anything in 5 years. It does not PRODUCE anything.

I was short 5 bitcoins at like 4300 over a week ago and bought back at 3800 once we had that mini-crash to 3600 that quickly recovered. Then I shorted 7 bitcoins at 4360 a few days ago, and bought back today at 4600, so overall i'm breakeven-ish, a little bit up. Now I'm waiting for some bear signs and then I'm in the game again.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:31:57
Thanks! I am worried though because 95% of people who own bitcoin do it for the same reason as you though - not because they actually use it for what it was intended for, but as an investment. And that's (partly) why I think we're building a huge bubble here. I could be wrong of course, and wish you the best of luck regardless. But please don't let your financial freedom hang on Bitcoin... at least be sensible about it and lock in some profit, such that a crash won't ruin you

Look. Nobody invests in bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. That's simply a fact. Your neighbour who invested 1k$ because he thinks fiat will go into hyperinflation any day now and all banks will fall does not count. No funds, no institutions, no government, no hedge funds, noone does it.

what kind of companies pay their employees in BTC? Is that even legal? In what country is this? It sounds extremely unlikely tbh. There was only one place that accepted bitcoin in Sweden (internet company, did it for PR), but they later stopped accepting it since they got so few purchases. There are no merchants left (that I know of) that accept BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:34:35
The point was not that gift cards are bad or "cheating". The point was that there's no widespread usage such that you can simply buy your tools with bitcoin. To buy tools with bitcoin one would first have to buy gift cards through another company. That was my point - to contend that BTC is in any way shape or form widespread.

I do believe in the blockchain, I think it will have many interesting uses. In fact I know it does, I did some interning for a swedish bank that started experimenting with the blockchain. But blockchain does not equal bitcoin, and I disagree that bitcoin is the biggest use for it. Even if somehow a government decided to embrace cryptocurrency, they sure as hell wouldn't use bitcoin. They would of course set up their own currency that they can control, for the reasons i mentioned in my earlier post!
With regards to poorer countries, I'm sure you can make a case for bitcoin there. But still, how many merchants accept bitcoin? Do they have stable internet in order to facilitate the use of bitcoin? Are people in Somalia who distrust banks/institutions all of a sudden going to put their trust in bitcoin of all currencies? If something they will buy/peg their currency/investment to a stable currency, such as the dollar or the euro (which actually a number of african countries have done). I'm also quite optimistic about the future of the world, the number of "third world" countries will strictly decline in my view. And with that comes investment and banks. And hence goes any potential need for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:11:17
I must respectfully disagree on your first point, I genuinely don't think it will be a global alternative. I do not understand why you would want to have bitcoin on your trip instead of your bank card.
As to government, yes I think they will simply force it. Bitcoin will be illegal if it becomes a serious threat, and any business accepting bitcoin will be victim to prosecution. 
And thirdly, I don't think bitcoin will be widely used in the third world. And even so, that market is declining. Poor countries are getting fewer and fewer.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:13:15
Because governments will never allow it. Being able to control the money supply is extremely important, especially if you subscribe to the keynesian ideas of the economy, which is very popular these days. Secondly keeping track of money streams, collecting tax and preventing money laundering will be much harder. If bitcoin ever becomes "big" then you can be 100% sure all governments will outlaw it. But the biggest reason I don't believe in Bitcoin is just that it doesn't fill a role. Nobody cares that it's decentralized. Nobody cares about anonymity or that the value of fiat decreases over time. Normal people just wanna be able to shop stuff easily with an easy to handle currency. And that's where banks already are good enough. I pay everything on card, I can send whatever amount I want to a friend in 5 seconds, etc. There's no need for bitcoin there. 95% of people in bitcoin is there only for speculation. Nobody is using it for anything. The last couple of month run up is not because bitcoin is getting used more. It's because more market sites allowed people to invest bitcoin more easy. It's literally a textbook example of a bubble.

Good series! Short literally just means that you make money when the stock goes down as opposed to being long, which is the normal format when you make money from when it rises. When the price bounces it just means that it rises sharply right after a sharp decline.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:40:55
It sounds like they just have different opinions than you. If Goldman Sachs writes a piece that says that Bitcoin has nothing unique and no intrinstic-value with a valuation of 500$/BTC then that's just their opinion. Which they are free to voice, just like anyone else. Just because you disagree with the opinion doesn't make it immoral. For what its worth, I also think BTC is massively overvalued at the moment, but I'm definitly not part of the big boys!
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:35:41

@_date: 2017-08-22 00:59:28
Sorry, being short means that you "loan" bitcoins and sell them, with the promise of giving back the bitcoins at a later point (with interest, of course). By doing this one can earn money when a commodity loses value. I did this at 4270$ a couple of days ago as I suspect bitcoin is in for a massive fall.
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:24:14
77 billion is nothing, and besides 95% of that is speculation. Nobody is actually using it as a currency, almost everyone uses it as a commodity. It's literally not a threat to fiat anywhere at the moment.

Since that obviously make no sense at all to anyone with a brain I asked some REALLY basic questions about the motives. I'll list them again for you you fucking retard since you seem to be incapable of finding them on your own.

That you think bonds and equities are overvalued is your opinion, obv the market as a whole does not agree with you or we would not be seeing these valuations.

There's a reason why truly big investors are willing to lend to the US at extremely low rates. It's because they know that there is no debt bubble and that the US will pay back its debts, just like it always has. If you think you're smarter than the worlds biggest investors you can make money by betting that the interest rates on US bonds will rise (which is what would happen if it started appearing that the US might have problems paying debts back), so I would suggest looking into that.

@_date: 2017-11-23 18:11:25
Ummmm how does this prove anything that you have said? It was during the 1950s at the peak of the cold war and the FBI used info to subvert what they deemed as extreme political groups that could affect the stability in the country? Preserving national security is exactly what they were designed for. They targeted a lot of groups and some of those we can see clearly were not malicious, since we have the advantage of hindsight. But they were not targeting feminist groups to achieve world domination lol. It's you who are making up a narrative that this somehow proves that the NSA/FBI are conspiring for world domination. 
Occams razor is necessary for you (and all other conspiracy imbreds) because you are trying to find events to fit into a certain narrative, instead of finding events and figuring out the most probable cause. Like this one for example as well. What's more likely, that the FBI/NSA were too afraid of the russians, their spies and the rise of communism around the world so that they targeted some fringe political groups that were not all bad, OR that targeting feminist and black rights groups somehow was a key stepping stone in their century long conspiracy to achieve global domination? Anyone with even remotely close to normal intelligence will realize that the first scenario is MUCH more likely.
Now you have some explaining to do about these machine learning algorithms that they are using on the data they collect. Tell me more about what methods they are using and for what purpose?

@_date: 2017-11-13 23:37:05
Yes but what is the underlying? A future without an underlying asset to hedge is just a bet. The entity that allows you to buy futures don't accept risk, so they hedge. So how would that work?

I'm not the troll mate. Try to find the other side of the story instead of buying into a narrative.
Thanks for the sources, will check out.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:13:31
Yes you can at any point in time find people or journalists who thinks stocks are overvalued. What matters is what the money thinks. What investors think. And there's no better indicator of what the market actually thinks than the market. 
So why are dividend ratios historically low, P/E ratios historically high etc? And the answer is because the lending rates are extremely low. Government bonds, company bonds etc are all really low, which means that there's really no alternative to stocks. They used to be the big thing that balanced up stock valuations. So that naturally drives up valuations of stocks. If you instead look at how stocks dividends are valued compared to debt return they're close to an all-time low, signaling that investors are taking into consideration the unusual situation that we're in. So yeah just looking at historic P/E ratios or dividends and declaring it a bubble is very misleading and doesn't at all show the big picture.
I was obv being snarky because it's such a tired discussion and a myth that's perpetuated by the media and journalists that don't know enough about finance to properly analyze the situation. And I think you guys (not you in particular but reddit as a whole) should know better by now as well, we've been in this situation for a quite a while now.

Alright i'll explain quickly since you won't google but I'm not going to waste any more time after this post getting caught up in a hopeless debate.
Trickle down was an experiment. It's not something that has been done before. Nobody knew how it would turn out. Economists had models, other economists had different models. The idea was that by creating more liquidity then more investments could happen, and more lending could happen which would drag up productivity etc and it would essentially create a positive feedback loop. Now it didn't turn out exactly as well as some economists had hoped and predicted by their models, but that's life. Economic models are extremely hard and can't really be summed up in an easy formula since it just describes human behavior. However it hasn't been a "failure" either, the economy is now showing great strength and unemployment is extremely low. The narrative that it was something that was cooked up by bankers and the government to enrich themselves that you often see around here, is FALSE. It was a dominant view among economists that this was a sound policy to turn things around.
Regarding Iraq, I'm gonna defend the US, I don't live there and I think it's generally a mistake to get involved in wars that you don't absolutely have to. But you have to realize what a problem Iraq and Saddam was. Not only was he a humanitarian catastrophy, but he was also super aggressive and started wars both against Iran and Kuwait (where the US had to save Kuwait).
Yes the US are spying on your own citizens, that's correct. However it's not because they want to know if you're cheating on your wife or w/e, it's to find terrorists etc. I'm against the surveillance state as well, but obv it's nothing to be worried about personally.
Yes everyone tries to avoid paying tax if they can, rich or poor. It's just that the rich have enough money that it's worth it to set up offshore accounts etc. The point is, as long as it's legal, it's fine. Close the loopholes instead of getting angry at people trying to lower their own tax burden. Nobody is required to pay any more than what the law says.
Nobody is going to hack the financial system lol. The economy is doing very very well and wages have started increasing to a very good level lately as well. I'm not even going to respond to this anymore, I'm sure you understand that the NSA has no motives to hack the financial system as that would just create lots of chaos and destroy value for the US, so this is just a conspiracy theory.
But yea try to google things and get the other view of the story before you settle on your own opinions. And try to think critically for yourself. Question your favorite speakers, not only the speakers that you already hate.

You are aware of how shorting works right? In order to short you need to find a big investor who is willing to lend his or her coins to you for an interest. Who exactly are they going to loan from to short bitcoin? There are basically no institutional investors that you would be able to loan from. Are they gonna contact some random schmuck who bought 10 000 coins in 2009 and ask him?
It's not as easy as 'just short bitcoin down to the bottom'...

Yeah but you're missing my point :) So say I'm the exchange, and you want to short. I sell you futures with a strike price of 3000$. That means I win if the price goes up, and you win if the price goes down. However, I'm a bank, I don't want any unnecessary risk - in fact I don't even know or care how bitcoin goes. I want to make a small profit regardless of how bitcoin moves. So I need to hedge. How do I do it? Don't answer that I should be willing to find someone who wants long futures - then I'm just matching two people and they're doing a bet about the future price of bitcoin - which will obviously have zero impact on the price.
No there is only one solution for me to hedge my futures position as a bank. I need to find someone who is willing to lend me bitcoin, so that I can sell them at market price. If the price goes down - fine I'll buy back the bitcoins I borrowed at a cheaper price and the difference goes to paying the guy with the future contract. If the price of bitcoin up - fine I'll buy back the bitcoins I borrowed at a higher price, and use the profits I made from the guy with the futures to pay of the difference. Hence - it's a hedge. This is how ALL shorting works - under the hood.

Honestly, I think it's because the banking system works well in Sweden already. Wiring money doesn't have any fees, and goes in 1-2 days, everyone already has debit card and every merchant accepts it. We have swish for mobiles, which means I can send any amount to someone else in Sweden as long as I know their phone number and it arrives in just a few seconds. I can't really think of any upsides of bitcoin for ordinary people who don't care so much about anonymity and central bank policies... I guess there just really isn't the same need here as in other places. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:31:50
Probably a good choice although the stock market is also pretty highly valued at the moment imo!
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:58:25
You are unfortunally the one who is not as smart as you think you are. It does not matter that miners have invested into hardware or electricity, that does not in any way constitute "backing" in the financial sense of the word at least. Backing in finance means intrinsic value if all else fails. For stocks that is dividends and things that can be sold if need be, for bonds that is the coupon you get each year, etc etc. That somebody has hardware for 1 MUSD$ does not in any way guarantee the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:34:02
Interesting theory! Who is paying these shills according to you?
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:55:43
Yeah it's generally seen as a last resort if they're unable to create inflation in other ways. Like I said, inflation is important and the central bank will do anything in their power to achieve ~2% inflation/year. I just didn't really understand how helicopter money was relevant to what we were discussing.
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:18:42
Have you got no shame?
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:45:57
Don't worry this is just starting :) Do you think that it falls 40% in 3 days and then just steadily goes up again?
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:00:54
S&amp;P doesn't include dividends? It's usually around 4% each year, depending on the company. So it's actually the rise from 1500 to 2600 + an extra ~4% annually. Which is about what you can expect long term, and nothing to scoff at.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:08:24
Don't worry this will fall.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:38:25
Trading is about buying high and selling low as demonstrated by this sub.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:22:36
I disagree that somethings that swings 30% per week is considered a store of value by especially many. It's a speculative investment.
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:20:43
If Jamie says it because he feels threatened by bitcoin long term then that's NOT market manipulation. Maybe you should go read some very very basic law books on finance laws. This just further proves that you guys have NO idea what you're talking about when it comes to finance. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:21:20
lol, my toenails has an in built cap too. That alone does not make it valueable. You are clearly not even trying to understand, it sounds like you've watched a youtube video telling you that all currencies are just built on trust and were perfectly content with that notion. Re-read again.

You will see that the definition follows what I have written.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:14:00

Any answer to this?
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:54:02
Sorry, fixed!
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:52:37
No I can't, they didn't exactly announce it publicly. If you don't believe me, then of course, I understand that, I too am skeptical of strangers making claims on the internet. But if you don't believe me on that point, you can still verify that they accepted bitcoin a year ago but don't anymore, and there is a reason for that.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:39:54
Haha jesus christ. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:12:27
Haha I wonder who has no real trading experience of you and me :) Why don't you scurry of to wikipedia and read up on the definition.
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:30:41
advertisement is the only reason bitcoin is at 4k... It's not exactly because of the wide spread usage that we see these prices.
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:48:06
Anyone is free to voice their opinion on the future of BTC, including GS. If they think price is gonna hit 4800 and then go down, they are free to do so.

I'm not sure I understand what you're saying?

ah neckbeards, who would have thought
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:38:55
Great, but I think bitcoin has potential to fall very very far. I've said it before but below 1k$ before the year is over would not surprise me.
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:34:49
look there are good bets and there are bad bets. People who buy clearly think they are doing a bet that will make them money on average.
@_date: 2017-09-21 23:34:54
I hate to go against the circlejerk, but I mean the case is ridiculous. He's not making profit for the bank or himself, the fact that some clients via JPM bought some bitcoin-trackers on the Stockholm exchange market means jack shit. There is nothing to suggest that JPM as a bank stands behind any purchases of bitcoin XBT. It's simply a man who expresses his opinion, with nothing (directly) to gain. 
Let me tell you how this is going to play out, no prosecutor will go forward with the case as it clearly lacks substance and as such has no chance of leading to a guilty verdict - and you guys will think it's the great big bank, lizard, jew, whatever, conspiracy that is making Jamie walk as a free man. And the circle goes on.
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:13:36
Do you think traders care about the intrinstic value of bitcoin? I'm trading myself, I follow trends and indicators. I long when I see fit and I short when I see fit. Nobody serious is holding bitcoin for the long term. There are no institutions or hedge funds.
I don't know the true value of bitcoin, nobody does. My opinion, however, is that the true value of bitcoin is much much lower than current valuation.
@_date: 2017-09-13 07:11:22
Good write-up.

I believe even less in alt-coins than bitcoin, but I think all of them will fail. The longer the time horizon the less chance that they'll still be worth something imo.

Meh the daily turnover in cryptos is pretty spectacular actually.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:17:32
In principle it's the same thing, you're borrowing BTC's that you're selling at market price with the promise of returning them at a later point. If you can then buy them back later at a cheaper price, you've made a profit.

Yes there could of course be hedge funds that invest in bitcoin that i dont know of. But given how many of the big players that have publically rated bitcoin, it seems unlikely that many of the hedge funds we dont know are invested. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:32:30
cool, don't invest more than you are prepared to lose
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:53:13
Yes it's not impossible in the long term. Governments need to control the money supply. It will be negative for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:23:34
I am not worried about the debt, and neither are any serious investors. Look at the kind of rates that governments pay on the bonds they are issuing right now. Most of them are around 0% on the 10 year, and some even have negative interest rates. If big investors thought there was actually big risks involved, nobody would lend to governments to 0-1% interest. And big investors know what the fuck they are doing, they are not just investing billions of dollars for huge clients without knowing their shit. The economy grows steadily over time, so increased debt is something it can handle.
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:36:32

I also trade bitcoin. Doesn't mean I believe in it, just that the market is extremely inefficient and it's easy to make money. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:07:32
Haha how about the fact that the USD is supported by the millions of products and services that you can buy with it? If you think the USD is a bubble in the same sense as bitcoin, well I would recommend econ 101 to you.

bitcoin is not even a comparable to gold in terms of trust.

I didn't say that?
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:19:39
So many people claim this I guess I should make a big post that I link to instead of explaining it every time. Bitcoin is not a store of long term value, just look through my post history if you want an explanation as to why...

Haha jesus christ.

I feel like an idiot, sold my shorts at 3800$ when I should have realized it would keep falling. Now I think of going long and playing the bounce, but I'm too worried about catching this falling knife. It's tough. Price is currently 3340$
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:42:32
there are a lot of daytraders in bitcoin that are attracted to 20% daily swings. Institutions and funds are not exactly thrilled if their portfolios swing 20% daily/weekly. That's why there's only a handful of hedge funds involved.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:38:14
Delusional... 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:03:51
That just sounds like classical liberalism to me, which is fine of course, but most people do actually want the government to hold their hand as they walk through life. Most people are very opposed to liberterianism.
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:20:40
Yeah that probably affects it as well - people love the government in Sweden.
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:06:13
This is stupid, even for this subreddit.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:03:33
It's a bubble simply because it has no fundamentals to back it up. 99% of bitcoin's value come from speculation of future fundamentals to back it up, which may or may not come true. If you think fundamentals will catch up to the current crazy valuation, then it's not a bubble, otherwise it is. In my opinion adaption is wayyy too slow to catch up with the valuation, hence I think it's a bubble.
I don't know why you would say that economists don't refer to things as bubbles anymore, they certainly do. I don't know why you think commodities can't experience bubbles, they can. Being a bubble is not connected to P/E ratios or other historic ratios, although there is a connection.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:49:26
Sure I agree that the government creating their own alternative is possible. I think this will impact Bitcoin negatively since there's no need for BTC anymore.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:25:34
Ehrm, I don't buy stuff with gold. I do that with a currency. A currency is not a store of value. I store my investments in a store of value (not gold in my case, but equities).
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:35:05
haha the central bank is the law. If they want to do helicopter money they do helicopter money. The fact that you think that a law would stop measurements that they deem neccesary shows quite a bit of ignorance...
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:11:44
You're making the mistake of looking at the past and assuming that it indicates the future. Bitcoin has grown extremely since 2011, and I was actually thinking about investing back then but I ended up not. It doesn't mean that Bitcoin's future is bright. The growth has mainly not been organic in the sense that people have started to actually use the currency. Instead it has been fueled mostly by speculation. Bitcoin is equally unlikely to eventually replace the USD now as it was in 2011, hovering around ~0% IMO. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:55:48
You are right of course, I was being sarcastic. It has no intrinstic value and people are purely buying on speculation that it will be worth more down the road - the perfect recipie for a bubble.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:09:05
or bitconnect
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:37:20
I mean that's easy to say now but I would argue that is being result oriented. Nobody knew that bitcoin would be as hyped as it is. I didn't think it was a +EV decision back then, but obviously I would have been a multi millionaire if I did invest. I think shorting this bubble is extremely +EV, although by now it has already fallen ~25% since I started getting into shorting bitcoins, so not as +EV as earlier.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:56:29
Another thing that people get wrong is this sentiment that it will eventually go back up again because "look at the past, bitcoin has always recovered and set new highs eventually". Sure, until it doesn't. Past performances is not an indicator of future results. If you believe bitcoin will eventually rise for fundamental reasons, then fine that's your opinion. But it's not going to rise because "it has always risen eventually". 
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:56:31
haha jesus christ. At least I tried.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:28:22
haha i always found it ironic how people who subscribe to these views think of themselves as critically thinking. When in fact they are the ones who only seek out information that supports a certain narrative. These conspiracy hats all have exactly the same views as well, which is reinforced by certain media and other echo chambers. Which is kinda ironic. 
Dude if you were actually reasonable smart and "critically thinking" you'd realize that there is no grand conspiracy. The banks don't control the world, neither do the rotschilds, the jews, the reptiles or what have you. Occams razor generally works pretty well with explaining the world, without the need to involve grand schemes. I'd point you too towards but at this point it's getting a bit old.

I shorted bitcoin and made quite a bit, although I sold too early at 3800$. Now I bought a relatively small post at 3360$ of 4 bitcoins. I don't think this bounce will be super large though so probably getting out around 3500$.

who cares if they are currencies or commodities, it's the de facto safe haven for investments. And besides, it can be argued that BTC is a lot more like a commodity than a currency anyway.

It's not an exact science where the line goes, sciences that revolve around human behavior never is - so I can never give you an exact figure. The debt of the US grows together with the economy - that's why nobody is concerned. There is a reason that the US loans to among the lowest interest rates in the world. Every serious investor trusts the US's ability to repay their debts.

It does have similarities to a pyramid scheme that are hard to ignore though. BTC has no intrinstic value like a stock or an accepted currency, it's only value comes from speculation. 
I think OP made a good post, since baseless "pump" post are regularly upvoted. Given how little everyone in here seems to know about economics it seems important that another mentality is shown than the constant hype posts. It's a real possibility that bitcoin goes to ~0 over time.

Thank you. I agree with your summary, and you're right I left out the home owners. I do agree they have some responsibility in this as well, you can't just take out a loan if you don't think you'll be able to pay it back and then just blame the bank for giving it to you when you can't pay it back.

haha jesus I know how inflation works. It's like you guys just googled that for the first time in your life and are appaled. That's why everyone invests their savings into gold/bonds/equties, to preserve/grow their money. There is a very good reason we have inflation in fiat you know? It's in the econ 101 book, probably 1st/2nd chapter!
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:58:54
Wow I just lost a ton of respect for investopedia. That clients of JPM can trade publicly traded assets such as XBT bitcoin on the Stockholm stock exchange is of course nothing weird. Their clients are of course free to buy any asset they like, not like JPM is going to interfere with that. EVERY bank works this way as well, Investopedia really should know better than to publish this misinformation. They are essentially fooling people that JPM bought bitcoin "for the bank", when that's not the case at all. I see JP Morgan trades on basically every stock on the entire Stockholm stock market, doesn't mean that JPM has specific views about every stock, it just means that many clients trade through JPM. This is as close to fake news you can get imo without technically crossing the line.

What did the definition say?
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:08:00

@_date: 2017-09-12 22:10:29
I understand what you are saying, but bitcoin is way too small to work with the current amount of people connected to it. For example, 10 000 people could gather and decide that four leaf clover are worth 5k$ per piece and they increase by 2% each year to combat inflation of fiat. However as soon as a few started selling it would have an exponential effect on the rest that stayed, basically creating a massive quick fall. And the reason is that four leaf clovers have no intrinsic value. They are not that pretty, they are not that special from other plants, they have no legal bodies backing them, they are not historically a sign of value, etc. I hope this explanation makes sense.

I mean I could write an essay, but I already did it in another thread and I don't really have the time to re-write everything. If you want you can check my posting history as to why I'm so negative towards bitcoin. But basically it's built on 99% speculation, no governments are ever going to allow them if they ever become a threat, and it's not even that great as a currency.

@_date: 2017-09-12 21:15:48
The difference is that anyone can create bitcoin 2.0 that is identical to 1.0. You can't create elements out of thin air. If people are willing to dig deeper and deeper for gold or mine asteroids that means that the gold you own is worth a lot of effort. Which reinforces the faith in the asset. 
Thank you for that lesson on how inflation works, I feel smarter already. Everybody knows this, that's why we invest into bonds/gold/equities to preserve/increase the value of our money. Nobody is worried about the debt in the USA, there's a reason why US bonds have among the lowest interest rates in the world. Everyone trusts the US ability to repay their debts.
The reason exchanges haven't been shut down yet is because bitcoin is no way shape or form a threat. Nobody is using it for anything except speculation.

Yeah but weed you smoke and get high, and alcohol you drink and pass out. What is the use for bitcoin if no store is allowed to accept it? And you're a criminal who can't sleep tight at night just because you own it? And how will you pay for the bitcoin without exchanges? Are you gonna find an underground network of people and wire them money in exchange for bitcoin?
In all practical sense of the word, bitcoin would be dead in that country.

The only big players are using bitcoin for trading or arbitrage, i thought that was obvious what I meant - nobody is holding bitcoin as an investment. Many big names have in fact publicly denounced bitcoin. 
Since I think it's overvalued I believe that the most likely scenario is that it will go down regardless of time horizon. Obviously the longer the time horizon the lower chance that the bubble is still sustaining itself.
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:07:24
Who needs proof man?     
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:59:09
It's not going for either of those things. There are companies looking at the blockchain technology, but no company is looking at bitcoin. There are still almost no companies that even accept bitcoin. Governments will never allow bitcoin (controlling the currency is super basic need for all governments), and honestly I don't even think it's that good of a currency. Obviously horrible as a story of value since it's has no intrinstic properties that make it valuable, compared to gold for example.
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:41:03
How exactly does not believing in bitcoin make me petty? I'm not doing anything to actively hinder the technology, i'm just sharing my honest thoughts and concerns. 
I am on the bitcoin forum because I consider shorting in the right moment and I want to stay updated on the news and also the general sentiment. I also wanted to try my arguments to see if there was anything I had missed to cause this valuation.
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:11:23
I'm not wrong yet :)
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:49:26

I understand what you are saying, but bitcoin is way too small for that. 10 000 people could gather and decide that four leaf clover are worth 5k$ per piece and they increase by 2% each year to combat inflation of fiat. However as soon as a few started selling it would have an exponential effect on the rest that stayed, basically creating a massive quick fall. And the reason is that four leaf clovers have no intrinsic value. They are not that pretty, they are not that special from other plants, they have no legal bodies backing them, they are not historically a sign of value, etc. I hope this explanation makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:37:23
It's ironic that you lecture on the misuse of the word when you clearly misunderstand it yourself. 
A bubble just means that the valuation far exceeds instinstic value. It doesn't have to pop tomorrow or go down to 0. But eventually it will go down from these levels - a lot.
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:06:00
Nothing can reverse that trend because it has nothing to do with interest rates. It has to do with the fact that nothing can grow exponentially so it's only natural that real returns will come down. They haven't lowered interest rates further because there's no need to - real returns are still sufficiently high. But when it does happen then market rates for lending will of course go down as well. Central banks are not (total) idiots and will eventually realize that rates need to come down together with returns on investments.
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:10:05
haha no they are not. There are like a handful of hedgefunds who trade cryptos cause of their volatility. I don't even know where you're getting this from. Every serious actor sees cryptos as kids playing in a pond.

The USD is not a store of value, gold is. The point of a store of value is something that will keep the same purchasing power over long time periods. The dollar is by design inflationary, as such it loses value over time - hence not a store of value.

haha I guess you'll never believe this but I was actually one of the better poker players in the world a couple of years ago and made closer to 400k$ and I'm here because I think shorting bitcoin is one of the best investments opportunities out there at the moment.

Like every big event it's complicated. Government pushed an agenda that every american citizen has the right to own a house, and thus subsidized and pushed banks to give out loans to americans that shouldn't really have loans. The rating agencies gave inflated ratings as they were all competing against each other, giving banks and insititutions the impression that the risks were much lower than they were. You can also critique the central bank for raising rates sharply in 2007, basically setting off the crises since this caused people to start defaulting. They should have realized the risks. And of course you can criticize the banks for getting swept with this hysteria and not realizing the risks of the loans they were giving out. But to put the blame solely on banks is just so ridiculous.
It's also easy to be result oriented and see the effects it had post 2008, but disregard the entire upswing between 2001-2007 that was in large fueled by this loaning frenzy.
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:01:57
Lol current short is after the crash we had and it bounced up and peaked at ~4150. I was shorting before as well, although I missed out on a lot of the big fall as I sold the position too short at 3800.
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:16:45
You are not getting the point though. There's no fundamental intrinstic value in bitcoin. Everything you buy with bitcoin is actually denoted in dollars. If a car costs 10 bitcoin, and then the bitcoin crashes 50%, then that car is sure as hell not gonna stay 10 bitcoin - it's gonna go to 20 bitcoins. Whereas if this was in the USA and the car was denoted in USD, then the price would stay the same. Thats what gives USD intrinstic value and bitcoin not.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:47:48
But they are seldom this fanatical about it.
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:51:49
Then re-read. The USD is not built upon speculation in the same way because you can BUY stuff with USD. If the USD fall too low then those goods will be too cheap, and the USD rises again. There is nothing like this in bitcoin.

[this will explain it better than I can](
But no they don't always charge interest on their loans to banks. For example post 2008 they took over troubled assets, straining the feds balance sheets. And in Sweden they currently loan to a negative rate. It has to do with controlling the economy, either stimulating it or cooling it in the case of overheating.

You have some points and some just ramblings that contradict your actual points. But breaking it down it seems you are confused in how to value a currency. Basically it boils down to arbitrage. Let's say country A produces 100 cars every year and has a money supply of 10k kronor, whereas country B also produces 100 cars every year but with a money supply of 100k kronors. Assuming producing costs are the same in both countries, and disregarding any credit rate considerations, then it's clear that one krona from country A should be worth 10 kronors from country B. People of both nations value a car equally much and are both willing to spend an equal amount of their income on cars. If the exchange rate was 5 kronors in country B for 1 krona in country A, then everyone in country B could just exchange money to country A's krona and buy a car at 50% discount. And what happens when lots of people want to buy country A's kronors? The price rises. How much? Until the exchange rate is 10 kronors for 1 krona in country A. And this is the fundamental value of a currency, it depends on the services and product that are DENOTED in that currency. Basically the euro can't sink too low since products and services produces in those countries would be too cheap, and any effective market would not allow this. 
And this is the difference with bitcoin. Nothing is denoted in how many bitcoins it costs. Sure you can buy stuff with bitcoin, but the price is always denoted in another currency, and then checks how many bitcoins are needed for that amount of fiat. So if bitcoins halves in the coming month, there would be no arbitrage opportunities, since any store accepting bitcoin would double the amount of bitcoins needed to buy the product. This is why fiat currencies have intrinstic value, whereas bitcoin does not in that respect, at least at the moment.
Obviously it would be hard, but if you know the money supply, the productivity, the rates of any given country, you should basically be able to calculate the exchange rates to other currencies. I hope this example was clear.
That's why adoption is the fundamentals of bitcoin, and preferably products denoted in bitcoin. I agree speculation is inevitable, and healthy infact, but based on what I wrote I think valuation is too far of fundamentals for this to be sustainable.

Realistically you have no idea if stocks are actually overpriced or not. The worlds smartest investors &amp; traders set the price every day and the current valuation is the one they have found. I assume you have no professional training in economics or know how to value stocks, it has been proven that the best choice for ordinary people is to just save in an index fund every month instead of trying to outsmart the market and time your entry. I'm very pessimistic on bitcoin but even if you believe in it, you can't deny the extreme risk it presents. Just do the same thing as other sensible parents and save monthly in an index fund.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:13:45

You should probably have read the article before linking it. It's about goldman sach's clients being able to invest into cryptocurrencies through GS.

I for example short bitcoins through IG markets, doesn't mean that IG are invested in bitcoin.

It's way too small for that. A group of 10 000 people can't just get together and say that bitcoin is worth 5k$/coin, and increases 2% per year to combat inflation. As soon as a few people started leaving ship it would cause havoc. Which is probably what we will see actually.
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:03:56

Hahahahahahahhahahaha you really don't get it.
I can make a simple guess, I can say it's 98.888825% chance it will go down on a 5 year horizon. But what would the value of that be? OBVIOUSLY nobody would know the exact chances. It's clear that I think it's above 50%. If it's 69% or 76% I don't really care. I haven't picked a specific number. I think bitcoin is overvalued and it will go down over time - as you increase the time frame the likelihood goes up. It's fucking stupid focusing on a specific percentage number, but once again - you seem to be an average user of this subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:00:25

It's possible to do through several platforms, but I use IG markets. I guess they have people who are willing to loan them a large amount of bitcoins for shorting.

Every time someone disagrees about something they are always paid shills according to reddit. It's interesting how that works. 
I'm actually from Sweden, studying industrial engineering and managament and I was actually close to investing in bitcoin a couple of years ago (however I didn't). I came to this forum because I have a decent bit of money that I'm investing and I think shorting bitcoin is one of the best moves available on the world market atm. I however sold my shorts at 3800$ so now I'm out of the market. I mostly post because there's so many people who have no idea what they're talking about, at least 50% of posts are completely delusional. It's a shame that so many people are getting into bitcoin without any idea what they're investing into and the risks associated. It's going to end in disaster for many ordinary people.

I know about the byzantine generals problem lol and I know bitcoin solves that. Once again, what do you think it is about bitcoin that I don't understand? I understand every aspect of the technology, but that does not mean the valuation can be arbitrarily high.

I hate to go against the circlejerk, but I mean the case is ridiculous. He's not making profit for the bank or himself, the fact that some clients via JPM bought some bitcoin-trackers on the Stockholm exchange market means jack shit. There is nothing to suggest that JPM as a bank stands behind any purchases of bitcoin XBT. It's simply a man who expresses his opinion, with nothing (directly) to gain. 
Let me tell you how this is going to play out, no prosecutor will go forward with the case as it clearly lacks substance and as such has no chance of leading to a guilty verdict - and you guys will think it's the great big bank, lizard, jew, whatever, conspiracy that is making Jamie walk as a free man.

That's why I'm thinking that the only logical thing would be for bitcoin to fall exactly as much as the new coin is valued at. So if the new fork is valued at 200$/coin then bitcoin should fall 200$/coin. Forks should be a zero-sum game.

You can make that case for sure - I will simply agree to disagree. I think the trust in gold is not even comparable to bitcoin. I'd even go as far as saying it's obvious noone thinks an investment that swings 30% is a "store of value". Because that's what I think it is - a speculative investment.

Not really. It actually signals too much trust in the fiat, since other options such as QE has failed to devalue the currency and as such the central bank needs more extreme measures to lower the value of the currency.

Eh the stock market has destroyed gold over a hundred years. Go ahead and google instead of speculating. Stocks have averaged about 8% per year since the 1850's, adjsuted for inflation of about 2-3% then that's still 5-6% real value increase every year. Which is about 5-6% more than gold.

You can make that case for sure, but it doesn't quite hold up. First of all gold has some fundamentals in the form of jewleries and for computers etc, but that ofc doesn't explain why the price is as high as it is. Honestly it's because people trust gold so much, it has culturally throughout history always been a display of wealth, in basically all cultures. Investors are betting that that trend won't change.

Do you think that more than 1/3 of all the alt-coins out there are going to make it?? Because if they don't then a higher percentage of blockchain-based coins fail than fiat-based coins, and in a MUCH smaller timeframe.
Yes credit grows quicker than GDP, it's called inflation and it's intentional... It doesn't violate any mathematical or economical principles, and there's is no reason why it can't be done forever.
Sure it's easy to outlaw, they can say it facilitates tax evasion, money laundering, and undermines the central banks policies. In this stage that's obviously ridiculous, bitcoin isn't disrupting anything at the moment - so if they want to ban it now they'll instead of to appeal to the fact that it's too dangerous for ordinary investors or that it facilitates illegal purchases of drugs/weapons etc. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:47:07
I mean I think a government ban would make the prize collapse so the whole "holding for gains" angle kind of disappears. If one wants to protect against inflation it's easy to buy bonds, gold or other interest generating instruments. Venezuela is different since their inflation is like 1000%/year, but yeah unless that happens in the western world I can't see bitcoin realistically surviving a government clampdown.

The thing that strikes me is how all bitcoin supporters are so petty. I work a lot with stocks and I come across different opinions all the time, it's normal.  You never come across anything close to consensus on valuations of stocks. But as soon as the people on this sub come across a different opinion they instantly go into defensive. Like you must have scrolled through pages of my posting history and answered something that wasn't even related to the topic about bubbles. Why is it that this sub has such a hard time accepting that people can have different opinions?

I've read similar studies and I don't dispute that parents and grand parents net worth is important. But not for the reasons you think, I think the net worth is less important than the fact that rich parents/grandparents value education and intellectual ambition higher than poorer peers. I also highly suspect that another factor is that high IQ tends to lead to higher net worth, and smart parents have smart children. And probably a thousand other factors that make children of successful people succeed. Basically, high net worth in your peers is important, but not for the reasons you imply.

The USD is not a store of value, gold is. The point of a store of value is something that will keep the same purchasing power over long time periods. The dollar is by design inflationary, as such it loses value over time - hence not a store of value.

Obviously having wealthy parents gives you a better chance of succeeding in life, I don't think anyone argues differently. But it's not because your parents give you a loan of a million dollars and then it's smooth sailing to extreme wealth from there, it's because they afford/care to give you a good education, hold intelligence and sucess in high regard, etc. Successful people also have higher IQ's in general, which means that their children will have higher IQ's as well - which give them a greater chance of succeeding in life.

It resolves the problem by using the blockchain, basically summing up a bunch of transactions into a block and finding a certain hash number to create a specific amount of zeroes in the resulting hash function. Since there are no mathematical models to do this, the computer uses brute force to try different hash numbers. Since any difference in the block would create a wildly different number when we apply the hash function, we can be sure that nothing has changed in the block once the number has been found. We then link this block to the next block and repeat. Since it takes a significant amount of work to find these hash numbers, we can be reasonable sure that the chain with the most work put into it (the longest chain) is the legitimate one.

It's possible to do through several platforms, but I use IG markets. I guess they have people who are willing to loan them a large amount of bitcoins for shorting.

Like every big event it's complicated. Government pushed an agenda that every american citizen has the right to own a house, and thus subsidized and pushed banks to give out loans to americans that shouldn't really have loans. The rating agencies gave inflated ratings as they were all competing against each other, giving banks and insititutions the impression that the risks were much lower than they were. You can also critique the central bank for raising rates sharply in 2007, basically setting off the crises since this caused people to start defaulting. They should have realized the risks. And of course you can criticize the banks for getting swept with this hysteria and not realizing the risks of the loans they were giving out. But to put the blame solely on banks is just so ridiculous.
It's also easy to be result oriented and see the effects it had post 2008, but disregard the entire upswing between 2001-2007 that was in large fueled by this loaning frenzy.

Thanks - I think too many people confuse themselves in economics, if you break it down it's really super easy deriving things by assuming people act rationally! You can literally derive everything in economics by a few easy axioms.
I still short based on fundamentals, not that I know them EXACTLY but I'm making some assumptions about the general ballpark. I of course use TA as well to find good entries :) I don't think my view of bitcoin will change barring that a nation implements it as their national currency.
But yeah I'm not naive, no bet is 100% sure. Bitcoin might succeed, bitcoin might fail. I might be right, I might be wrong. I just deem the likelihood in my favor - and that's all you can ask for when making bets!

I sincerely disagree with the entire notion that the historic price chart is a strong indicator for the future. It goes against the perfect market theory, which is a pillar in all economics. I disagree that bitcoin will survive simply as a store of value. It needs to be adopted to maintain it's current valuation. I disagree with the blog post you posted, "good" money does not drive out "bad" money. I'm sorry but I didn't find it interesting nor enlightening. I disagree with the notion that only people who don't understand bitcoin can be pessimistic. I understand exactly how bitcoin works and I don't believe it will succeed.
When I invest in equities I look the fundamentals. It's really the only thing that matters. Historic price movements is about the 500th thing to look at in the list of important factors. Unless i'm speculating short term in which case I agree that psychology is more important than fundamentals. If you think bitcoin is fundamentally undervalued at for example sub 3k or whatever then that's fine, agree to disagree. But to think it's undervalued because the chart has always gone up before is wrong, and the mindset will be dangerous.

The same is not true for other currencies to the same degree. The USD has a lower ceiling that it cannot get cheaper than since otherwise you would be able to buy good and services from USA much cheaper than you would from the rest of the world.

@_date: 2017-10-27 18:12:54
Actually it's you who simplify things. The byzantine general's problem is about how you can create decentralized trust in a system, and that's what the blockchain does in the way I explained.


I think your division between users, holders and miners makes little sense. I'd only divide between users and miners. Miners are kept honest because only the longest chain is valid, and any coins on an illegitimate shorter fork will become worthless quickly. Users are kept honest by the work put in by the miners. I obviously know what proof of work is, the proof of work is simply finding the correct hash number that I talked about earlier.


I mean, in a sense the users are paying the miners I guess, but not really. What really happens is that in every block, on top of all the regular transactions that are included, there's also another transaction included of a certain amount of bitcoins that goes to the miners adress. It doesn't really matter how many users there are or how many transactions were made, for every block that the miners mine they get a certain amount of bitcoins. The only way the users really affect is increasing the demand, and hence the price of bitcoin, which obv is good for the miners.
You also say in the first sentence that it's the users who "pay the miners", and in the next sentence you write that it's the holders who "pay the miners." 


The way that this is managed is that miners order the transactions, and race to hash them to an algorithm (the work in proof-of-work), which is in bitcoin, SHA-256, until they get an answer that they will be accepted by the nodes (proof).
I mean you wording is a bit off, they don't "race to hash them to an algorithm", they simply just apply SHA-256 on the block and see what number pops up. The number of 0's in the begining of the number that pops up is the important thing, a certain amount is needed for the nodes to accept the block as legitimate, and the amount of 0's is dependant on the has rate. As I'm sure you know, bitcoin aims to get 1 block every 10 minutes, so the amount of 0's required is changed depending on the hash rate to achieve this. 


Once again, kind of, but not really. The nodes don't award the miners bitcoin, the miners include a transaction to themselves in the block that they're creating. The nodes simply either accept or reject the block. The reason you have to wait a few blocks is that, in case the miners changed something in the transaction history (for example sent themselves loads of bitcoin), then that's not going to match up with other miner's version of the chain. Unless the fraudulent miner has more than 50% of the hashrate, the legit chain is eventually going to become longer, and the shorter fraudulent chain will be rejected.


I'm not sure you're implying that the hash function could change from SHA-256? That's not the case anyway, the hash function will always be SHA-256. What would happen if a bunch of miners decided to stop users from recieving blocks is that the difficulty would adjust such that 1 block would be mined every 10 minutes. If a chain happens (like with 2X coming up), then the users would decide the value of the coins on both forks, regardless of the hashpower on them. The miners mine for profit and will mine whichever fork is most valueable.


I don't even know what you're trying to say here. Users can't attack the system because they would become holders? That seems like... a jump of logic.
But like I said, I already acknowledge that bitcoin solves the byzantine general problem and that it's technologically impressive. My point about bitcoin is that the valuation is ridiculous, and there aren't even close to enough fundamentals to defend this valuation long term.

I am not worried about the debt, and neither are any serious investors. Look at the kind of rates that governments pay on the bonds they are issuing right now. Most of them are around 0% on the 10 year, and some even have negative interest rates. If big investors thought there was actually big risks involved, nobody would lend to governments to 0-1% interest. And big investors know what the fuck they are doing, they are not just investing billions of dollars for huge clients without knowing their shit. The economy grows steadily over time, so increased debt is something it can handle.

I mean that's not the same thing at all. It's one thing to diversify your portfolio - it's another thing as a company to mitigate risks that are connected to your business. As someone who is getting into this field with many of my friends already working in it, it's extremely unlikely they don't hedge their open positions. Nothing is impossible but i'd put it up there with the moon landing being fake. So you can debate both those things all you want I guess.

Look, I understand the technology. I'm an engineer with degree in industrial economics &amp; computer science and I've spent a lot of time learning the blockchain technology. It's a glorified public databse. Gold has intrinstic value partly because you can never create more, and partly because it has industrial uses. And it's beautiful to look at, and has always been seen as a status symbol. The biggest difference between gold and BTC is that you can't create more gold. And before you tell me that there can be a maximum of 21 M bitcoins, it's still just numbers on a screen. You can create a fork, an alt currency or whatever. It's genuinly not a store of value.
They'll shut down every exchange and go after every store that accepts BTC. And if you have to exchange BTC into physical USD$ every time you want to buy something then really, what's the point.

haha what? I have never heard of anyone in Sweden getting robbed by their bank. Could you link to a reputable source explaining these syndicates that steal your money right from your bank account?
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:09:07
This cannot be stated enough, almosh everone on this sub seem to fall into this trap.
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:38:04
Yes that's how it works. Have none of you had a brokerage account?
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:10:06
Good job you're already losing money.
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:56:58
How do you know they are paid? Could it not simply be people who are invested in bitcoin cash and hence want to see that fork prosper?
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:26:43
Hahaha you really understand nothing it's hilarious :D Your understanding of how traders think/work is truly amazing to see! My charts tell me there's a 98.825552% chance bitcoin is down in 5 years buddy so u better selll!
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:56:45
haha I'm a troll now? I'm here because I think bitcoin is a massive bubble and wanted to check out how people were reasoning before going short. After seeing this sub I've been shorting on and off the couple of last weeks as you can see from my posting history. I'm currently short 8 bitcoins @ 3950.
I'm majoring in computer science so I think I know how the blockchain works... It's a glorified public database. It uses the fact that two primes multiplied is basically impossible to find the roots of, but easy to verify, to make it secure. Same as SH256 encryption. It uses hashing to make sure nothing changes between blocks, since any change in the content of a block would create a wildly different hash number. But yeah it's a glorified public database.

hehe thanks :)
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:21:47
I'm saying the issue is not black and white. Part of the blame is on the government for subsidizing/pushing banks to take loans they shouldn't have. Part of the blame is on rating agencies for not putting fair risk assessments. Part of the blame is on the central bank for sharply increasing rates in 2007. And part of the blame is on the banks for getting caught up in the frenzy and giving out loans to people that shouldn't have them. That's what I'm saying.
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:09:04
What exactly is your point? What do you mean when you say a positive feedback system? The fact that any system can't grow exponentially forever is obvious, but this is nothing that bitcoin or any currency can change. Returns will inevitably shrink in the future, and therefore returns on loans will shrink as well - they need to be in harmony with each other.

So much this. Lots of egotripping autists in this thread.
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:13:56
You didn't adress anything, but ok whatever guess you're not going to answer.

@_date: 2017-09-27 16:32:45
Fundamentals like how many actually use bitcoin for anything but speculation, compared to how many use the euro for anything but speculation. If the speculators get tired of owning euro, that would hardly affect it's value. If bitcoin went out of fashion for speculators, that would affect the price in a spectacular way.
This is why I'm worried about the people in this sub. You all love bitcoin and invest large sums, despite proving over and over again that you're unfamiliar with the first chapter in econ 101.
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:01:25
I'm majoring in economics and computer science...
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:59:20
lol you have no idea if bitcoin will rise next time it collapses. Those who call it a bubble clearly doesn't, me included. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:05:49
I mean opening new accounts to customers without their conscent is obv shady, but not the same as stealing, at all. Also they got a lot of shit for that, Wells Fargo. If that's the worst you can find then my point certainly stands.

Oh forgot you have to pay for school in your country.
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:10:12
And you're a horrible person, ever thought about that?
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:46:28
Why don't we just do 1 fork each day and we'll all be billionares in a year then??
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:48:51
lol you can't say that 2008 didn't work. It got the job done.
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:20:17
Since your strongest argument against it being a bubble is the fact that it has "risen several hundred percent this year" then that talks heaps in itself...
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:28:30
Disagree. When returns go closer and closer to 0% then lending rates will adapt. It's a free market, noone is going to take your 10% interest loan when return on investments are for example 2%. Lending rates will always be slíghtly smaller than return on investments.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:58:00
Please don't buy any more bitcoins. This will not end well.
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:58:04
Seems like a semantic difference... The point was that it's certainly possible to save and make money long term outside of crypto!
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:13:21
I shorted bitcoin and made quite a bit, although I sold too early at 3800$. Now I bought a relatively small post at 3360$ of 4 bitcoins. I don't think this bounce will be super large though so probably getting out around 3500$.

Like I said i'm also testing my arguments to see if there was anything I had missed that might explain this valuation, but there doesn't seem to be anything. But I also see a lot of people who lack understanding basic economic concepts and I feel compelled to help. If you want to invest in bitcoin, go ahead, but at least do it on solid ground and not misinformation. There seem to be a LOT of beginners in here, so when I see someone who clearly misunderstand a concept I chime in.
I understand the technology exactly, like every part of it. Im mastering in computer science and industrial economics and I have spent a good amount of time understanding bitcoin. I understand how and why the technology is impressive. But the part of me that knows economics understands that the valuation is ridiculously high.
@_date: 2017-09-21 06:34:06
Lol that's a ridicilous statement. I think you know I have a point here.
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:31:14
Even if the inflation is "artificial" it's still good for the economy. People need to know that their dollars will be less worth in a year, so that they invest now - thus fueling the economy.
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:35:51
Who cares if his daughter bought 2 bitcoins. It doesn't make the case any stronger, at all.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:46:19
Then the only question is - is bitcoin something you truly believe in? If so, by all means hold on. Otherwise, sell and put that money to good use elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:48:07
They dont. There arent even that many platforms that allow it

This is exactly how normal (fiat) people feel about you guys over here at @_date: 2018-04-29 22:03:16
lol what? I'd take that bet for any amount any day of the week. This is beyond ludicrous. haha jesus christ you guys
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:00:31
I don't hold Bcash you moron. I just said normal people hold fiat and we all think you're both retarded.
@_date: 2018-04-29 22:01:44
This is not correct lol

Then i open the next thread on this subreddit. is for sure the subreddit with lowest average IQ on all of reddit. Just watch the replies in this thread :D
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:53:53
that's because you're an alt right conspiracy nutcase, it's normal and nothing to worry about it.
