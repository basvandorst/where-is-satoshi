*More than any other time in history, [Bitcoin] faces a crossroads; one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness, the other to total extinction. Let us hope we have the wisdom to choose correctly*

There has never been a deliberate hard fork in Bitcoin's history.
@_date: 2015-05-16 03:33:41
Please explain for us humble analysts.

You have not heard of [decentralized tumblers?](

At worst (if Gavin pushes his changes without the community reaching consensus), the hard fork will cause some market turbulence, but it won't kill bitcoin outright. The fork will fail, or it will succeed, and whichever chain wins will continue on its merry way.

So does using Bitcoin, as opposed to pushing around IOUs from a website.

It's the **World Wide Ledger** baby, why'd you use anything else?
@_date: 2015-05-18 01:51:38
I would like to consider Bitcoin's [Joinmarket](

Don't you get this from certain HD constructions?
@_date: 2015-05-16 07:53:48
Sing with me, peasants!
*We don't need no world wide ledger*
*We don't need no coin control*
*No trustless mixing of transactions*
*Lawsky what else did you write for me?*

Lightning only needs a soft fork.
@_date: 2015-05-10 18:07:16
That calculation disregards how larger blocks reduce upwards pressure on transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-05-12 02:09:15
You keep adbusing that verb...
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:42:27
Why not withdraw 100%, wait a few weeks for the dust to settle, and then put your coins in what emerges as a good platform?
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:25:35


They do not. Sidechains are a way of testing new features that may be too raw or broken to be put in the main block chain.

Pre 0.8 was nondeterministically forking *from itself*.
Adding to the maximum block size at this point would be a hard fork from the current rules.
@_date: 2015-05-16 03:24:40
And got a slap on the wrist and a parking ticket.
@_date: 2015-05-31 22:21:55
Was not disappointed:

[BIP42 pull request]( is hilarious

Oh hey, Tom Butt~~coin~~erfield is back!
@_date: 2015-05-12 02:08:19
You're doing Satoshi's work.
@_date: 2015-05-08 10:55:14
Why does everybody associate earning interest with usury?
This is equally similar to having your bitcoins run a lemonade stand, and pay you the profits.

They're about as relevant as his thoughts on microtransaction antiscaling.
@_date: 2015-05-05 23:29:56
Call them what you want, my point is that the "cliff" metaphor is misleading. It's a slope and we're already climbing it.
@_date: 2015-05-08 12:00:03
If you want to hear what somebody else says, sure. The way to *verify* is by running software, and a web browser doesn't count.
@_date: 2015-05-31 07:47:22
TIL about keming
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:36:44
Check out the [pending transaction pressure]( over the next few blocks/hours/days; there is no "cliff", we already have a growing permanent backlog.
