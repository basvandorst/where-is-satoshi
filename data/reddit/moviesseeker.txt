anyone else think BTC will back to 5000$ USD by Oct 7th.

Let me just be the idiot rather then waste my time trying to making you understand. Keep cheerleading them.

why would they feel bad or guilty ,they are getting rewarded for the risk and trust they took on btc very early.
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:31:13
i doubt it.
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:37:57
is the next dip already started?
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:41:54
nah i am not gonna sell it anytime soon ,just was wondering cause a guy online said it would be back by 7th oct quoting different reasons. just wanted to know if anyone else think the same

people in this sub should stop cheerleading people into buying Bitcoins ,sure inform others about BTC why its smart to invest and other reasons but let them decide whether  they should buy or not.if they lose no one is gonna help them or take responsibility.

down we go 
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:05:36
"people like you have encouraged people to lose money "
wait when was this.
also we are no creating fud ,you guys cheerleading people to enter btc  without any knowledge and if they enter any market  without any prior knowledge they are bound to lose.
