Post quant computing can just take every btc you've ever owned out of your wallet so no it won't outlive human extinction. Also the nsa could do the same, today.

I don't really understand that comparison. With the solution to fly you're creating new technology not upgraded existing to achieve the desired result. I'm talking about something akin to LN to btc. Or putting a stage 3 turbo on a 93 civic. Its going to fall apart eventually, and with respect to LN it goes against the decentralization philosophy of btc but thats another topic for discussion.

True, but switching over isn't something that can happen so seamlessly when you're not building a high level assurance project/code from the ground up. These are all just layered solutions. Sure you could also fork but thats not btc anymore. Layered implementations are like putting duct tape on the issue. Javascript was made in like a month right? We've been updating it for decades to get out some of those flaws from its inception and one of these days js won't be as prominent as it is today and something will take its place. Same thing for btc and 1st gen PoW as a whole at a different scale.

I don't think in a our lifetime that a miner could get their hands on a QC implementing Shor's or Grover's algo for attack and if they do (Shor's) the world is in trouble hah. We would hit the 21M mark way before they do, but anything is possible. 
edit: I don't rule out one bad actor, but someone like you or I would be near impossible to acquire such tech

because its possible, and btc maximalists are delusional
