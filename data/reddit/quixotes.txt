It's not an issue. You aren't qualified to weigh in so you weren't invited. Perhaps you should vote with your feet because your opinions aren't really required. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 19:24:00
I'm not interested in a semantics argument. When does code become 'encryption' if you tweak an encryption tool minutely is it still the same tool? You can't ban encryption. You can't ban math.
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:54:01
Most of what you just said makes very little sense. It's not a closed meeting, it's a meeting of people who need to be there (ex: actual code contributors and actual miners). For those of us that don't fit those categories we have the transcripts to read and then have a larger open discussion, if necessary. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 12:32:01
This shouldn't be taken seriously. Nothing like this could be effectively enforced.

The point is to restructure compensation for content creators and end-users. This is a big deal and is far different than just using an ad-blocker. Edit: Also focused on a safer web experience. 
@_date: 2016-08-26 15:12:42
Jesus. This isn't difficult... Math can be done in someone's head, math is ephemeral, math is difficult to define -- the same can be said of encryption. Your drug war example? Drugs are concrete, classified and easily identifiable, confiscatable, they leave an evidence trail. Enforcement is a semantics argument you can go have with yourself. The effectiveness of a ban is kind of the whole point. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 20:05:41
Then the Fed doesn't have closed meetings either, then. That was my point. 
This model is the way it is because they are the ones who are qualified to write the code and to make responsible decisions with the direction it takes. It's a complete meritocracy so if you have good ideas and can write very good code then you can contribute. 
Lastly, I'm not sure why everyone is in such a hurry to change Bitcoin. We want it to be difficult to change, impeccable tested, and incredibly predictable. This could be the global reserve currency.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:01:38
Uh... yeah... maybe not in an interview with a global audience, and maybe not if you're trying to pretend to be a genius who had always been calm and measured. This reeks of a douche who is cracking under extraordinary pressure.

No they can't. Putting .0001% of users in jail doesn't ban encryption. You absolutely cannot ban math -- this should be common sense.

I've only used LastPass and it works fine. I believe the 1Password is a bit of a hack for now... not sure. Still definitely a beta browser that could use some UI improvements as well, but it's very fast and is one of the most interesting projects in Bitcoin, imo.

@_date: 2016-08-28 00:52:31
I'm not talking about the semantics of the word ban... The effectiveness of the ban is kind of the whole point. If it's not effective then it's not meangingful. There isn't a way to make this ban effective. That's all there really is to say -- please provide evidence to the contrary if you have any.

The underlying LN tech is still a work in progress so the user experience will have to be ironed out afterward. I would guess that once wallet providers have incorporated LN payments it will look something like what you suggest.

You are adding at least two separate conversations to an already muddy thread. My point is, you cannot effectively ban encryption tech. This isn't even open for debate. 
Encryption is absolutely essential to global finance, the internet, the success of a state, the success of any digital technology that requires some data to remain hidden from prying eyes. 
If you want to build a case for some fantasy scenario, then by all means do. My point stands as I'm talking about the world we live in, and some fringe actors (like the ones in the article) have zero chance of dismantling technologies that make the world we live in possible.

And that last bit is why you should keep digging. There's only bitcoin - all else is marketing and fraud. If you can get to that point of understanding bitcoin becomes an excellent investment (as a small % of your overall portfolio) due to how scarcity affects human psychology. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin... truly incredible.

Either of those resources will explain why some people find it a compelling investment, which has little to do with making payments.

It's actually math that makes bitcoin far more secure than a bank. There's no "handwavey bullshit" involved. Bitcoin is in its nascent stages and it will only get easier to secure your funds. You go right ahead and stick with banks who have been around for centuries and continue to cheat and steal funds from their clientele. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 18:46:47

I'm not sure why you'd think there's any risk of losing BTC--there isn't unless you're considering user error. There would be limitations trying to offload large amounts through exchanges. Connecting directly with a buyer interested in large quantities might be a better option. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:29:48
BU is broken code with a terrible development team that does not solve scaling! Bigger blocks are just one part of a myriad of improvements that need to happen in order to have true scaling. Think about storage scaling.... sure you had higher capacity drives but you also had write caching, SSDs, RAID, etc. 
Segwit enables a Bitcoin caching layer and bigger blocks.

This wasn't really my point. The IoT kitchen scenario is ridiculous and needs to die. My point is that none of us know much of what 21 Inc. is up to, and everyone should be cautious to suggest otherwise. The article brought up very well-trafficked criticisms and came to a presumptuous conclusion. 
Edit: Also, I might just be a lowly network admin, but in supporting a high traffic environment (hockey arena) our Aruba APs have never fallen over due to too many client connections--bandwidth has always been the true bottleneck. Maybe our network engineer is just that bad-ass. Modern home wi-fi devices aren't really in danger of this either, in my experience.

The device is in no way harmful to Bitcoin. There isn't anyone out there that is interested in this device that believes it's necessary to use Bitcoin. People will buy it to kick the tires, people will buy it to have the ease of trying out mining and running a full node with the same hardware, people will buy it to sell services without having to do the heavy lifting of writing code. This is all fine.

What does this have to do with bitcoin?

Traditional database tech will always be "faster", but they don't speak to one another. When you try to get centralized databases to speak to one another you introduce middlemen which are a security risk, costly, and incredibly slow. This is the huge improvement that Bitcoin ushers in and this is how Bitcoin is "faster".

21 Inc's platform will also monetizing APIs. Things are going to get very interesting in the next 5 years.

Any electronic device still has a paper backup. The device is used more for signing transactions. If you aren't planning on spending the coins, then paper wallets are cheaper but in no way better. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 15:10:48
Where are these platforms you're talking about? Colored coins, open asset protocol, many others all seem to believe that there are solid use cases. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 13:41:20


How exactly will 21 go about co-opting Bitcoin? The device will make it easier to sell things for Bitcoin and you're complaining? Not every Bitcoin user will write code and not every user will want to understand how Bitcoin works.


So?

Banks don't have a monopoly on payment channels. They don't even really do all that much in the way of payments--that would be the CC companies and paypal.
Banks are starting from scratch on an absolutely massive project. They are in very early days and have many massive hurdles to overcome. These projects are in no way a threat to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 19:37:09
You get the databases to make-out and the transfers just happen. Right? 
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:48:03
You're comparing Paypal with Bitcoin? Paypal: A.) Isn't that cheap. B.) Will straight up steal your money when it feels the need. C.) Will only transfer your funds when X conditions are met (verified identity, linked bank account or CC, etc.).

These chips, even if they become ubiquitous, will never push their hash rate to where it would need to be. They are low power chips used to snag a few satoshis. The satoshis could be used for some interesting off-chain interactions: authentication, asset tracking, machine-to-machine interaction, receipts, etc.
@_date: 2015-09-24 13:24:43
I'm only calling you out on your bullshit. There's no "harming" Bitcoin and there's no evil VC conspiracy. Be happy that smart people are taking Bitcoin seriously and that they're providing products that just might push it forward. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:38:16
Wow, you're pretty confident considering "this" isn't even software yet. The banks offerings will remain mostly unchanged, but it will save THEM a lot of money. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:58:52
I just told you what will come out of it: banks saving money. They aren't interested in providing micropayments or remittances... I'm not sure where you're even coming up with this stuff. 
@_date: 2015-09-11 17:20:52
Probably worded that poorly. Bitcoin will be faster in a scenario requiring trust and traditional database tech will be faster when all parties are trusted. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 19:24:29
You're an idiot. Have a look at Github. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 22:05:39


And why would they have to? They won't, purely because there's no money to be made as a middleman in micro-payments. The real magic happens when consumers get directly connected with content producers. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 17:37:12
They are building software utilities for Bitcoin. If you can't see how this is useful then I suggest seeking out some of Balaji's talks on Bitcoin--he mentions Bitcoin needs a "Redhat-like" software provider. Eventually these tools will be GUI driven and allow anyone to sell anything for Bitcoin.

Miners would have to be paying pretty close attention, no? I wouldn't want to count on that.

I don't know, maybe check out github? 
@_date: 2015-11-08 18:14:45
Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous at best (buy your coins p2p in cash but the transaction history is still wide open) but is certainly not anonymous in any sense for most transactions (bought via KYC AML compliant exchanges). 
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:41:15


bitcoin is a currency, and a database technology, and a protocol for information exchange. 
@_date: 2016-10-28 12:42:18
No you don't. You can create an account and download software.
@_date: 2017-05-05 12:58:28
Show me where that was one of the "selling points". If you don't do your own diligence and then bitch about what Bitcoin is providing you then it's your own stupidity. This is a bullshit statement.
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:40:59
No... the person I responded to said that Bitcoin was sold as competing with Visa/MC on fees. Visa and MC do a fine job at what they do.
Low processing fees is absolutely accurate if you need a way to do so without TTP, for very large amounts of money, etc.
@_date: 2015-10-06 11:42:16
So, you didn't read the instructions, made a bitchy post, and then they helped you out. Nice of them.
@_date: 2016-05-06 15:06:45
Edit: You're right, but with a governance layer on top of the dev layer there isn't even the option to opt out. I trust devs more easily because there is logic in code. I absolutely cannot trust a governance layer because they will always have their own interests first, prone to corruption, no clear underlying logic to those sorts of decisions. 
@_date: 2016-05-16 22:46:37
localbitcoins if it's popular in your area.

Coinkite is better in every conceivable way.

They announced that their platform is open to everyone and not just those with a 21 computer.
@_date: 2016-05-06 13:13:40
Thank you for your hard work! Despite the toxicity, there are a lot of us that are very happy with the direction Core is taking. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 13:24:42
Introducing governance would be re-introducing trust. Bitcoin doesn't need governance, but it does need talented developers. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 22:24:30
Nick seems very positive about what Ethereum has accomplished. He's also kind coined the term "Smart Contract" if I'm not mistaken.

Yes they do.
@_date: 2016-05-18 21:08:58
Oh, it's quite the opposite. Core's roadmap is well thought out and cautious which is exactly what I want as an investor. If Eth is already out-innovating bitcoin then what are yous still doing here?

Have you ever been inside a highly secure data center? These measures are pretty common.

I see. You'll never get that on Reddit. I see much better discussion on Twitter and don't expect much from my time here.

This is def misinfo. Brave isn't just Adblock with micropayments it's a complete shift in how ads are delivered or aren't delivered--it puts the user first. It also includes https everywhere, site scripting control, etc. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 12:04:16
I agree that it's faster. The bookmark toolbar is very buggy on Linux, at least for me.

There is no demand created by Steem, look at their top posts, they are all Steem hype. People will go to a site if it has good content and they will not go to a site for some scammy alt-coin scheme.

It's the most realistic depiction of hacking I've seen. What in television has been better? Also, you have no idea what's going on in the show right now. There may be a reason they want it paid in person... they did ask for a C level executive to deliver it...

This isn't a censorship-muh-liberty-muh-freedom issue it's a community of people that think a certain way, and moderating content happens to be part of it. Yours and Ver's narrative is tired and whiny BS that has done wonders to stir up shit, but will do nothing to correct the issue. 
By the way, Twitter exists... It's pretty good for discussion and content sharing that you can 'censor' on your own.
@_date: 2016-07-15 13:48:12
You miss the point so severely. 
Miners have very limited power, they are beneficiaries who need to behave properly or they will see their entire investment go to $0. 
As far as Bitcoin being centralized... Is someone preventing users from participating, rejecting transactions, reversing transactions, black-listing coins, or confiscating coins? No. 
Is Bitcoin faster than a wire-transfer? Is it cheaper than a wire-transfer? Why, yes it is. 
Does Bitcoin have a predictable and rock-solid monetary policy that makes it an excellent store of value? It has that too. 
If you are happy to stick with Paypal, banks, and the like no one is preventing you from doing so. Hanging around and showing your lack of comprehension over-and-over just makes you look like you may have a touch of dementia.

Nope. The user overpaid and he still got a great deal
@_date: 2017-06-29 12:26:58
This is certainly a valid attack on Bitcoin, but it won't work in destroying cryptocurrencies for the same reason they can't destroy bittorrent. 
Also, this attack would require constant influx of money and new hardware to keep up with GPU and ASIC advances and a whole three letter organization worth of employees to keep it running. 
The main reason I see Bitcoin not getting attacked by a state actor is that they'll be afraid of destroying innovation and growth that an economy desperately needs. One nation attacks and 3 others decide they will support and reap the benefits.

I'm glad to have people like you on the wrong side of history. A global, decentralized, and permission-less currency with excellent monetary qualities is a revolution, and all you can think to do is claim ponzi. Not. Very. Imaginative. I'm not sure if you are too enraged to notice, but Bitcoin has already succeeded.

The end of home mining does not mean mining will not end up more decentralized than it is today.
