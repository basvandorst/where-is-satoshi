"Drama is drama so if i just ignore it it doesnt have any effect on my payment options"
Were so far up our own asses weve almost reached the bile duct.
Edit: because I'm not doing a good job of explaining my point: when i joined the fledgeling crypto community a few years ago, advocating the further fragmentation of the community to pursuade users into compliance would have been seen as hearsay. Weve become so tribalistic that weve lost sight of the original purpose of bitcoin: open and free econonics.

Wow. I left this community for about a year after the scaling debate blew up, hoping it would resolve itself in a few months or so.
Apparently, either faction instead just continued to crawl up their own asses.

It usually takes 20 minutes but it's the weekend so they probably have no employees working to fill the invoice

The thing is when the government 'broke' tor to find DPR they didnt even expose his identity. It was later they found his indentity after intercepting an email containing his full name.

How exactly does this work? There isn't much information on their website.

If you have premuim you can download playlists. From there you can play them without an internet connection.  You still have to play it through spotify,  however

I (as a resident of the united states) use it to purchase things online for three reasons:
1. Its Cheaper -using snapcard and a good exchange I only loose like ~1.5% of my money to fees
2. Its transparent -I always know where my money is and if something is going wrong (I also don't have to deal with CC customer service)
3. It works on a Debit-Based system so I can never pay more money than I have saved(:
I really only use bitcoin for online purchases. Unlike many people here, I don't invest in bitcoin really, rather I purchase a little and then spend what I've bought. Its much more convenient than people think and using it even today isn't that hard. I believe in and use Bitcoin not because its the future, but because its now.
