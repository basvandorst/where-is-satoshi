You need to purchase a static IP from your ISP. Typically when any device (routers) connects to the internet via the ISP, they are assigned an IP address from the pool of IP addresses maintained by a system called DHCP. There is no guarantee that you will get a same IP everytime. Static IP reserves the same IP to your system (usually against your MACID which is globally unique)
@_date: 2018-08-26 19:41:12
Assume that bitmain is sitting on ton of BCash bags and it's tanking. Billion $ apparently, so they are trying to offload thru schemes like IPO to bigger suckers

Maybe true. But best to educate users that both are different and ignore the negativity/prejudice. Sold my BCH stash to put back into BTC. But that's just me. To each their own.

Maybe the wiki could maintain a section called "Wanna Be Bitcoin" forks, with BCash as the sole item, and the the other coins forked out of Bitcoin.

Apologies, if I misunderstood. They have GBP to a few coin pairings (btc, eth) for deposits and withdrawals. 
Since I have only deposited and not withdrawn, guess it's "in theory" only, then. Deposits seemed to take a day, which seems standard as per SEPA transaction norms (their bank is in Portugal)
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:36:07

Warning that u are investing at ur own risk. Not outright banning inr pairing. They do not have rights to tell me what I can or cannot do with my money. Burn it or buy BTC.
