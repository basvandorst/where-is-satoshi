There are quite a number of Bitcoin companies in the PH. Have you contacted the Bitcoin Philippines Organization? I believe that would  be the optimum venue to network for business. As for myself, I'm just your usual IT person. ;)

Awesome. Of course, I'm saying that because I set it up. :))

At the moment, we just take your picture since our government does not have any sort of machine-readable ID other than our Driver's License which is not compatible with the machine. Going forward, we may introduce SMS verification combined with fingerprint verification but for now, you can just walk up to the ATM and transact away. :)

Yep. If you read the sign on the photo, it shows the name of our company.

We are using ANX for our pricing and for now, we have a 4% markup. Ideally, we hope to lower this as we recoup our investment and the support from the local community will definitely play a factor in helping us get there. We believe that convenience is our strong point and we fill in that market niche quite nicely.  
  
EDIT: The ATM is accessible 24/7 and is right beside the security station of the building lobby. :)

It's called Bitcoin Philippines, not Bitcoin. I'm not the CEO. Haha :P
