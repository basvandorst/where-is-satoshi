It's not that I can't afford them, I just haven't been able to go out and get one recently

I'm aware, but my monitor doesn't work if I have the GPU plugged into the power supply. What I'm trying to say is that it prioritized the GPU over the motherboard. Does that make sense? I'm not sure how exactly to explain this.

Disclaimer: I have never bought a stock before
But why not just give the bitcoin and get back a certificate of the stock or whatever usually happens (I have no idea) than making things more complicated?

thats ok. ive been mining for a while now with what i would assume to be a fairly good graphics card (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650) and i can only squeeze 27 mhash/s out of it. 0.05 so far after about a month or two of mining on slush's pool. i had been mining on 50 btc for a while and racked up about 0.08 but then there was a big hacking/ddos issue and i lost my whole account/worker. so theres that.

Well when I have it plugged intone power supply it doesn't let the monitor... I don't really know how to phrase this.
It no longer sends the graphics through the motherboard's built in ports to the monitor, it uses the graphics card. Which is why I need a cord to hook it up to the monitor.
