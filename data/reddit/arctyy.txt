I wish I wasn’t a broke college student and could afford to dump thousands :/
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:33:02
Bought at 5500, not a whole lot but feelsgoodman

My mom asks me if I won anything like it’s roulette

I have hodled through every dip since mid October. Been tuff
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:26:01
Word, I’m over here buying $50 worth every couple weeks just to see a small profit haha but it’s the little things 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:35:12
Also at 6500 and 9500, we chillin out here mang, 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:37:43
it may seem tempting to buy now considering how much the price is increasing, but in my personal opinion, itll dip significantly after the fork
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:12:07
Get a hardware wallet, Trezor or ledger 
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:10:03
Ledger Nano s

Yes, great product

That’s been my mindset the past week I’ve started getting into crypto. Have food at home? No need to stop for a bagel. Got coffee and milk at home? No DD run. And so on.

Definitely makes sense, just needed some other thoughts on the matter. Will absolutely watch some videos and learn more considering I haven’t even been in the bitcoin business for a whole week yet 
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:11:19
So basically, any bitcoin I accumulate from coinbase should be placed into a software wallet until I earn enough to buy a hardware wallet? How much does that usually cost ? (USD)
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:14:44
I commute so not necessarily

I bought in 30 before it soared yesterday/today, and I’m contemplating the hundred buy in weekly, just waiting for it to dip again. I at least have that general knowledge. Another question though, if you (or anyone reading this comment) use coinbase, if I buy at a dip but it takes a couple days for the transaction to go through, is my bitcoin worth what it was at when I made the purchase or when it’s pushed through days later? Sorry if that’s confusing
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:53:52
Yeah, hate having to wait a week to get the funds. Buying off GDAX is instant though ?
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:15:31
Do you have to add USD to your coinbase account first?
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:59:22
I haven’t gotten that far yet since I haven’t actually gotten my wallet. But I’d assume so, just punch in the address into coinbase and you should be able to transfer there to sell. Coinbase does however own a site called GDAX where you can buy bitcoin without a fee and have it moved to coinbase for almost nothing. I’m not entirely sure however but a little research could help tremendously

No problem man, Reddit’s helped me out very much so far just trying to return the favor! Welcome aboard !
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:16:48
Yes it’s a USB you plug into your laptop and you run a program off of it. You manually store all your currency in the wallet. Honestly your best bet to get solid info is to watch some YouTube videos. Just type in Ledger Nano S review and setup and you’ll be fine.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:56:07
I purchased some on Friday morning and it tells me it’ll be in my wallet in 7 days. No clue why as I was able to buy some on Tuesday instantly 
Edit: I checked the email and it says what the exchange rate was when I bought.  I’m just going to assume that my bitcoin will be worth that amount then and not when my order is actually pushed through and I receive my btc
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:12:19
Buy a hardware wallet, that way the bitcoin is actually yours and not coinbases. I recently purchased the ledger nano s
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:17:56
Thanks for advice man definitely appreciate it. Don’t have much to my name currently so I’m not in a rush but will make sure to move my small amount (and I mean very small) of XRP and BTC to a wallet soon 
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:49:06
Yeah the fees are a buzzkill
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:45:26
The drawback is that you don’t actually own the coins private keys, coinbase does. So if coinbase were to either get hacked, have site issues, or just say fuck you and close your account, you’re without your coin. Moving it from coinbase to your own personal wallet removes all those factors and you yourself own the keys and coins. You’re your own bank
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:26:45
Just took a quick look and honestly it’s well put together, nice job man
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:01:56
May I ask why to do so so urgently? Is coinbase not secure at all?
