Must suck not being able to read.

I don't need to pretend, I have cashed out sooo much already, I don't have to worry about a thing for the next ten years. How's your bitcoin hate going for you, financially? Making tons of money by running around "u guys r all stoopid this will so fail soo hard"?
You should really sell that wow gold though, that's highly inflationary, i.e. a shit store of value. 
And while you're at it, maybe stop playing video games all together and stop dicking around in a sub-reddit where you spread hate like a pathetic weasel, and instead get an actual purpose in life.

Jesus fucking christ, you're actually succeeding with this sensationalist bullshit. They are not confirming anything that you claim they're confirming. The fucking statement is:


Reading comprehension, you got some? That means "yeah we know about this thing, now fuck off". It means absolutely **nothing** else. Them "incorporating it into their plans" doesn't mean they are putting anything into one of their products. "Their plans" could be world domination, and if Bitcoin stands in that way, "incorporating it into their plans" could just as well mean "destroy it as soon as possible". It means **nothing**.
This place is so full of retards eating your bullshit up, it's just sad. I can't really tell if you're just an idiot who actually believes what he's saying, or if this is a blatant attempt at market manipulation. Either way, you should be ashamed of yourself.

Seems your neckbeard is itching?
Better spend some more of your worthless time trolling a community that you allegedly hate?
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:15:38
Yes, you're confused. Likely because you are trolling in so many threads at once that you forget what you said where and what or who you're replying to. Just looking at the last post doesn't always clear that up, you need to remember what *you* said too.
Let me refresh your memory, here is what you said:




Here **you** were implying that which you later tried to blame on me: that we should look at past performance for predictions about the future.
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:41:12


I can't even possibly describe the amount of eyerolling I'd have to do to appropriately comment on this statement.
He "lost a lot of money by sacrificing his time for bitcoin"? Really? How retarded would you have to act for this to be possible, with bitcoin appreciating in value in thousands of percent?


What's JRE? The Java Runtime Environment? Anyway, phew, that's a relief. So it seems Andreas doesn't spend $1k for some Dorian Nakamoto while be's being completely broke himself, that's good to know then!
You can rest assured that he has more coins stacked away than the usual bitcoiner. That's the sole reason he's being so vocal, propagating bitcoin. 
Or, yeah, maybe it's to save the world or something, you know, for the good of mankind, wink wink.

The site has a big fat button "AML &amp; Compliance" on the top. How about clicking on it?
@_date: 2014-05-21 09:44:30


Where is it defined this way? By these definitions, gold and other historic forms of money are not considered currency either?
I'm not saying you're wrong, just curious. In fact, I could agree with those definitions. I instinctively connect the term "currency" with fiat, while I don't for "money".
So Bitcoin wouldn't be and I wouldn't *want* it to be a "currency".
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:56:14


Oooooh, IS it then? Says who, your ass?
@_date: 2014-02-18 03:27:08


You must be really gathering wrong if *that*'s your take.
Just do the mirror exercise, at least 1x daily until you're ready to kill yourself. Then tell me and set up a webcam.
@_date: 2014-02-18 02:53:37
Pff, effort. Just like to this guy, it's obvious to me that you're some sociopathic little cretin. You can't ask me to put effort into pointing that out to you, more than you can ask me to put effort into arguing with my toaster. I rather just belittle you, since that's the only thing a sad narcissistic fuck like you actually notices.
Here's an exercise for you: Stand up, right now, stand in front of a mirror and ask yourself "Am I a sad fucking loser that nobody loves?"
@_date: 2014-01-14 08:10:12
\&gt;75% here. You sound like a pussy.
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:09:30
And now you think you're making a point, even though you're just losing yourself in your bias again.
Bitcoin is gambling, is that it? That your point? Was that your point when you started? It's really hard to tell, you seem to just grab whatever you can, which is apparently what you want me to do too now? 
Nah, thanks, I'll stick to logic, not the circular type that you like though, sorry. 
And "bitcoin is gambling hurrr durrrr" is really not the kind of deep revelation I could hope to find here. My 7-year-old son could form a more well though out opinion. I'll spend some time with him instead. Have a good night.
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:06:40
I like how in the video, you can see the display lying on the table, flat, aaaaand connected to a computer. 
So, how are you gonna get the computer on my arm? Nothing new about flexible displays, but have you somehow made a magic flexible computer? Would love to hear your plans on how this is supposed to work. Hint: it's not going to.
To me, this looks like nothing but vaporware. Just trying to get sales by making nerds think: "Oooh, flexible watches, so futuristic!"
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:06:37
Aww, so close to not appearing like a sad and angry dick for once. So close.

Geez, do you really ask for an explanation now what a fucking index is for?

this is obviously a throwaway, dumbfuck
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:36:42


You are very clearly ideologically invested. And if you think non-participation means you're not biased, you're just fooling yourself.
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:51:37


Pretty sure you just described yourself, right?
And you can take your "dose of reality" and shove it up your ass. The only thing you're spreading is hate, you pathetic dickweed. Fuck off.
Your follower-mentality hero-worship for "one of the greatest investors in history" does nothing but out **you** as a typical sheep. Clearly this old dude knows more about technology than we do because he has shitloads of money, right? Baaaah.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:37:05
Fuck you, you lying little piece of shit.

...and has always come out stronger than before.
@_date: 2014-02-16 04:53:11
You're the one who's quoting past performance. 
I'm pointing out that it obviously indicates the opposite of what you're trying to say.
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:35:43
Sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of being so fucking rich thanks to bitcoin. Go have a blast laughing, while I count my money.

No, roulette is gambling.

Let me guess - you expect to get money now?  
And I bet some retards will even grant you that wish.

You're being the pedant by obsessing about his use of the word rape. You were wrong, and he told you why. Now just shut the fuck up before you completely make an ass out of yourself.

Good comeback! ^If ^you're ^12.
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:39:04
Sure. Are you though?
A: "Look at that past performance, it should be a warning sign."
B: "But the past performance indicates something entirely different."
A: "Well, duh, you shouldn't look at past performance, idiot."
Makes sense to you? Right, that's because it doesn't. It's just "A" doing what he does best: failing at logic.
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:31:48


you're making me hot
@_date: 2014-01-18 00:39:54


No, it wasn't. Maybe before **you** read it on reddit, yeah.






Ah, the good ol' fairy tale.


That statement was so retarded, you should feel embarrassed.
@_date: 2014-01-18 09:13:27
I can barely hold back the vomit. It's mainly last night's alcohol, but I suppose to a rather big degree, it's your fucking retarded post right here.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:10:13


Damn right. By me at least.


No, because you're full of shit.


No, it won't. It won't be catastrophic for me. I don't have money tied in gox, so even if they completely fail, I don't lose any coin. And if you think it will be catastrophic for me because the price might go down a bit for a while, well boo-hoo. I've been in bitcoin since it was single digits, I think I'll survive a little more price rollercoaster while you noobs shake in fear because one service goes down that has at least 5 solid replacements that do the same, and for the most part a better job.
And the mass media... are you serious? They give us free publicity! You know, not all people are actual fucking retards. Many of them have heard of bitcoin before, thought "meh but the price is so high, maybe I should buy hm but maybe I shouldn't" - when people then hear "Bitcoin suffers huge crash after one exchange goes insolvent", lots of them will recognize that as an entry point. And then you have the old bitcoiners, who are just waiting to re-enter the market after they've sold in the crash, and the new bitcoiners, who have just found their entry. The total number of bitcoiners only rises with media coverage - ANY media coverage. Barely any people who are already in bitcoin will actually say "OK no no no mtgox is gone, so I'll leave bitcoin forever", or is that really what you believe?

Let's get the circlejerk going!
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:51:36
I got most of the money only because of Bitcoin, and only because I wasn't an overdiversifying pussy like you. I still believe in the system and its future, I don't need more diversification. When Bitcoin is valued over $15-20k I'll start converting a bit to other assets.




@_date: 2014-02-18 03:11:53
Nah. I'm not even sold at all on that myself.
I know a good bunch of people personally who think Bitcoin is stupid and a bad idea and can never be successful. But do you think they spend all their free time here? They don't. And when you understand why normal people don't do that, you'll understand why I have so little of an opinion of you.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:48:14


I don't care if you believe me or not, it would actually surprise me if you did. It would ruin your whole idiotic obsession with assuring yourself that this is all bad and you're doing the right thing.
You got to be pretty damn delusional if you can really convince yourself that the bitcoin price grew tens of thousands of percent without many of us making a lot of money - and also cashing a lot of it out into fiat ("real money" as someone like you would say, derrp derp).
And botting wow gold... I don't really know what to tell you there except pointing out how pathetic that is. Not only are you *at best* making pocket change, you're also deliberately ruining a game for other people. But well, that fits the profile well, doesn't it?


Yeah, it would be really fucking stupid if you did.
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:32:06
haha, sucker.

Heh. Looks like I hit a nerve and your neckbeard *is* in fact itching. But jumping into some defensive sarcasm is surely gonna save the day, yay!
You know what *is* actually creepy? Some guy spending whole days worth of his time in a place just spreading hate.
@_date: 2014-02-18 02:15:08
Except you *do* hope it fails. Even if it's just so that you're right.
