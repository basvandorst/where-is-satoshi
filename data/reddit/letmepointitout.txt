Yes, we just need to believe harder and we will pass 20k!

If you can't figure out Wireshark, how is having the code open source going to help?

That's about the smartest thing I've heard in here. I paid off my car and have since just kept saving the same amount of the payment each month in an investment account. I don't plan on ever borrowing money to buy a car again.

Which exchange price is this based off of ?
Not that it will be under 10k in any exchanges by Sunday night, but still worth clarifying.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:56:13
So what is the incentive to run nodes?  Transaction fees?  If someone was able to build a network that incentivized node owners better than bitcoin could that completely wipe out bitcoins value?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:56:29
Still confident?  Looks like it's back up over $15,000.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:09:56
I want to believe this so bad.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:26:26
I bought in at 10k, sold at 14k for a 40% profit...then jumped back in at 19k...why, why, why, why, why...it just hurts.  I just need to be patient and forget about it.  Diversify more.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:54:48
Litecoin is actually up way more than BTC over the year, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:44:57
To me that means it's unsustainable.  If everyone all the sudden buys into Bitcoin because they heard they will get 40% back or something like that, something has to give.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:35:58
Exactly.  No one here knows how many people are just trying to ride the train to whatever their sell point is.  How many of these people are going to bail at 20k?  How many are going to panic sell the first time a drop hits and then never come back?  Anyone who sits and proclaims that bitcoin will go up forever is as bad as those who proclaim it's going to drop 80%...if anyone actually believed it was going to keep going up and up "parabolic", they wouldn't be on here typing their comments...they would be busy doing whatever they could to get as much BTC as possible right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:23:56
It's definitely something you need to have an end goal in mind with.  It's hard not to get scared and not to watch the price all through the day.
Waiting out corrections is tough too.  I looked at my screen last night as I went to bed, trying to decide if I should buy in at $14400 or not...I didn't, and when I woke up the price was $16400, and then on top of that there was that crazy surge to $19,000.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:12:48
I'm just thankful Coinbase takes a few days to actually give you your BTC.  I bought the same time you did, but then doubled down at 9k.  Hoping for a small dip so I can get some more.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:36:59

Please do so the demand goes up.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:05:41
USA.  Absolutely up, had several other people check.  You sure your browser isn't just cached?  I am able to buy/sell and am watching the price go up/down.  Definitely live and working fine.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:43:19
Back up now.
Edit: Since it's so hard to believe - 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:43:10
I got too excited after selling off for an easy 20%...I figured we would hit 20k and shoot up hard.  Oh well.  I'll keep holding now.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:53:48
Help me understand something...as I understand, Bitcoin is decentralized and is run from various pools.  What happens if people that run the Bitcoin network lose interest?  
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:53:30
Let us know if he actually pays out!
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:50:26
Everyone was eyeing opportunities when it was going up, up, up...this kind of drop is going to scare away a lot people, both ones that are already in and ones that were looking to get in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:39:09
Stopping with "what if" is key.  If you can get yourself to do that, do it.  I bought/sold some around 2012 and then again in late 2013.  Then I started buying some again a month ago...and have been making stupid decision after stupid decision trying to predict the drops and make small gains.  Today I'm right at my break even point...which sucks because if I had cashed out yesterday I would have made 20%, this morning 65%, and now I'm just hoping to get out unscathed.  So many what ifs...
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:07:39
Had a 20% profit, sold, bought back in at $19,300 thinking things were going to hit $20k and go crazy...I hate myself.

That's a long way to drop in the next 10 hours...especially when it's still around your above comment.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:23:00
Are you me?  How can I literally make the wrong decision over and over and over.  At this point I am just going to hold because I'm stubborn and want to either get a 20% profit or ride this to the ground.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:35:23
So what is stopping someone from selling a USD bought bitcoin to someone for korean money or euros?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:37:22
Right, but we're not talking about "purely speculative holders" or even being "into bitcoin".  You stated, "How you've found your way here at all without knowing him is damn near a miracle"...which is a complete stretch.  Plenty of people come here not knowing who this guy is.  The initial comment you replied to is even one of the highest ranked comments in the post.  While it's great you know who this guy is, it's pretty obvious that plenty of people here have no idea.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:48:45
It's just like DBZ.  9000 is this unbelievable number for an episode and then 10 episodes later they are all stronger than it.

I just checked on 3 separate network connections as well as 
It's fine.  Even if you post a screenshot.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:23:29
I agree.  Took a bit of time and stress to get there, but I'm just going to hold now.  I can afford it and need to diversify a bit anyways.  Will be a fun ride.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:14:05
Hopefully you are right.  I was lucky enough to get up 20%, sell out, and then buy back in.......at 19.5.  I'm an idiot haha.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:11:52
I honestly think that is a huge part of why Litecoin took off the last week... People get Coinbase, see the price of both, and then think, "well at least I can get a whole Litecoin".
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:30:10
That's where you're wrong.  I can consistently time the market, just in the wrong direction.  If I buy, you should sell.  If I sell, you should buy.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:38:08
Basically you watch the price go up and up until you buy in and watch it immediately go down.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:24:12
I literally had this dream last night.  I was on GDAX, but the page wasn't fully working, I could only see the amount in the top of my Chrome tab.  It dropped to $35 and I couldn't figure out what was going on or load any other sites to see why the price had just dropped so suddenly.  I decided to buy 100 at $35 and was scrambling to get my order in.  Then I woke up.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:47:05
Just someone dumb enough to buy in at 19.5 again :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:17:09
But if the apples are being sold on the internet, why can't we all just buy from the lowest priced apple store?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:24:14
Lol, well now you guys have both said different exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:55:59
Eh, you're being a little dramatic.  I've been visiting this sub and have been interested in crypto since 2013, took a break until recently, and have no idea who he is.  Asked several people at work who hold BTC...no one knows who he is.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:48:51
I'm saying the site is back up now.  I am on it right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:49:35
Is it really as easy as that?  I know several people in Seoul.  If you have a second and could understand, I'd appreciate it.  This aspect of Bitcoin never makes sense to me.
@_date: 2018-08-28 01:15:03
If you put it in a few years ago, aren't you still up a ton?

I'm the shill
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:17:00
I just bought a coin, hopefully this isn't just a quick bump and is an actual increase.
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:05:19
I'm thinking the same as you, I don't know why I got so hyped up.
@_date: 2014-05-25 13:48:36
Yeah, but the sub here has a special case of absolutely ridiculous opinions. I bet if we looked at everyone's posts over the last year that claimed what the price would be today, they would all be wrong.
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:19:33
That awkward moment when...
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:13:58
I should have kept calm...instead I just bought a coin.  Well, hopefully it goes up enough to justify my purchase, but I kind of feel like we are just on a small rollercoaster bump.
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:26:48
...but...but what about the circlejerk?
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:55:29
I bought in at $494 haha.  I shouldn't have got excited over a little bump.  Hopefully it breaks $500 within the month.  
@_date: 2014-05-25 13:45:35
Now I've only lost 40% of my money, take that professor bitcorn!!
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:34:26
As great as Overstock is, they just don't have the things that Amazon does.  It's like saying we should jump ship from Best Buy to Walgreens.  Sure, some of the stuff crosses over, but not much.
@_date: 2014-01-10 00:07:24
I just buy Amazon gift cards through gyft...works like a charm.
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:14:16
I'm sure it will eventually be back up to ~$600, I'll probably sell around then.  It seems like every person that makes an estimate on this sub about what the price will be in the future have been wrong.  Too many variables are in play for anyone to make an accurate guess.
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:27:14
A pretty good number of people on this sub.
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:19:36
And it looks like we're going back down...why did I just buy a whole bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:25:19
NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS.
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:45:25
I'm on a diet. Thanks though! ;)
@_date: 2014-05-17 01:08:38
While professor bitcorn is wrong, it does still hurt to see it trading around $450 when it was up at $1200 within the last year.
@_date: 2014-05-29 12:34:01
So far no movement in price. I really thought thought we would see a small jump.
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:06:45
Absolutely serious. If I buy something online with bitcoin and the seller doesn't deliver, I'm left with nothing and no one cares. If I buy with a credit card I'm practically guaranteed to get my money back, no questions asked. Plenty of credit cards extend warranties on purchases, which is even more protection. Bitcoin is great for some things, but I won't be doing my online purchases with it anytime soon.
@_date: 2014-01-10 00:06:34
Overstock is great, but really isn't comparable as others have said.  It's like comparing apples to oranges, Overstock won't have everything that Amazon has and Amazon won't have everything that Overstock has.
@_date: 2014-05-02 19:54:32
I have to disagree, USD really isn't that volatile.  Take a look at what 25 USD could buy you over the last few years compared with 1 BTC.  Just in the last 2 years 1 BTC has gone up and down from 200-1200, back to $350, and is now only at $450.  USD isn't anything like that, as much as we want to sit here and praise BTC, it is very volatile right now and could go up or down at the drop of a hat.
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:35:09
Time will tell, let's stop with all the silly predictions. No one knows where bitcoin will be a year from now, let alone more. I would love a collection of all the comments claiming to know where the price will be a year from now.
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:08:13
I'm curious about this too...what if it's just their giftcards renamed?  $20 in apple bucks.
@_date: 2014-08-01 18:48:11
It's definitely a marketing gimmick. Just like how when I say, "is that your final answer?" you think who wants to be a millionaire. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:55:59
That's about as ironic as rain on your wedding day.
@_date: 2014-08-01 06:08:52
That's exactly the point of it. Everyone knows  Jeopardy. It's just branding. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:14:50
To be fair, buying with a credit card is a whole lot safer than buying with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:16:19
You almost had a legitimate argument and then you completely ruined it. He's right, you're wrong, get over it.

I guess that's one way to look at it haha.
@_date: 2014-05-24 13:13:29
Also, don't call it a comeback until we at least hit $1000 again.
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:33:19
Yeah it's been a couple months now and no one does it. They forget how to do it every time I go.
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:53:55
My question is why are we acting like something huge is happening here?  There are a lot of people that bought in around $1000, getting to $600 means we only lost 40%!
@_date: 2014-04-16 16:31:11
Or how about 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife??
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:29:48
Tapping 500 and then going right back down.  I bought at $495, I made a mistake.
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:33:13
Paypal and credit cards don't charge fee's to the buyer...I've purchased a few thing online with my bitcoin, but never anything that another random seller has to ship me, mainly just giftcards through gyft.
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:42:14
By the way you're acting, it certainly seems like it.
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:54:31
There's a pizza place by me that accepts bitcoin (in a fairly tech driven city). I'm the only person that has ever bought from them with it. I ask every time I go in.
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:51:37
Hey, would you mind posting or sending me a link to your site? I'm looking into getting a ring soon.
@_date: 2018-10-02 13:52:17
Source? That should be pretty easy to find here, right?
@_date: 2018-10-02 13:51:20
Now it's even more funny since it still hasn't bounced back.
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:08:01
Are you sure you want to place bitcoin in such a niche market as currency exchange? If you polled a thousand random people right now, how many do you think have exchanged currency in the last month?
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:09:18
Right, but how many people covert their money earned from labor over to another currency? Not many.

@_date: 2017-11-28 16:26:28
No, not hypothetical.  I don't have all the details on what exactly they did or why they did it the way they did.  All I know is they were planning on cashing out as soon as the stock hit a certain point, which they were positive it would (hence buying the giant house), then the stock crashed and they lost their job (I believe the company completely shut down a few weeks after the huge stock crash).
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:54:38
Which is completely useless if you have to bring it back in to governments reach for any meaningful spending.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:07:54
I bought in last night at $10,800 hahaha.  Picked up twice as much at $9000 today though.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:06:52
On the other side...I had some friends that worked at a company that was doing really, really well.  They had a good amount of stock and decided to buy this huge house.  Biggest in the neighborhood, huge pool, yard, everything.  It's an absolutely beautiful home.  They decided to keep holding their stock just a little, little bit longer...it completely crashed overnight.  The company went out of business soon after, leaving them with a huge house and no way to afford it.  They could have sold a month or so before and had more than enough for the house, but they just wanted that little bit more.  They had to downsize to a small 3 bedroom condo for a few years...I can't imagine what that was like to go from the 8 room mansion with pool, theater room, everything...down to the 3 bed condo.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:08:12
Might as well have been...nice reference haha.

You're basically saying that you can look at your past poker hands and come up with what you should bet on your next hand based on that.  That makes no sense.  Your past hands give no indication to what your next hand will be.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:58:34
Exactly.  As an Enron shareholder, I just have a little bit more holding to go!  My Sears stock is also on this same path!  I'll be able to retire in no time!
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:38:14
And how will that help when you're playing with new players every hand?
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:23:16
Exactly.  If it was as easy as reading a chart, the whole world would put every penny they own into Bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2018-07-16 01:05:55
Where the risk? The charts told you Bitcoin will be 6 figures in a few years, so you can do anything you want until then. It's like having the almanac from back to the Future.
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:26:25
So he has every reason to hype it up and make these claims?
@_date: 2018-07-19 15:31:06
