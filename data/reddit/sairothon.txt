Would you then say that a proof of stake coin e.g. Lisk is not a pyramid scheme? Not a rhetorical question.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:34:51
By that logic, every stock/publicly traded company is a pyramid scheme.

Getting pretty tired of seeing this circle-jerky posts on Stop upvoting stuff blindly and actually think about what's being said. This is complete nonsense.
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:11:50
You've missed the point. I don't want to see nonsense content like this. I welcome any valid criticisms against banks, but the analogy is this post is a complete strawman.
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:08:24
You're bringing up a completely different argument.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:12:25
Agreed, that's pretty much the only reason why I am holding it. I don't believe in it really long term - after crypto becomes main stream and a multi-trillion dollar industry. There are just crypto currencies out there that do a lot more and can do what Bitcoin does much better.

Came here to say this as well haha, that video was great

Can you quote the part where I said bitcoin was worthless? cause I can't for the life of me see where you got that idea from.


I'm gonna assume you're referring to my example of buying at 1$ per coin and then having the price drop to 0.5$ a coin. In that scenario; no, I am not saying that selling at that point would result in a "loss of fiat". What I am saying is that at that point, you've already lost half your money because you've lost the capacity to cash out for your original 100$; you can only cash out for 50$ now.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:04:12
Is it even a word though? Google define doesn't come up with anything :P
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:53:07
Except BitConnect :P
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:55:15
Again, I never said they were worthless. Pay attention.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:53:55
You've completely misunderstood what I said. I'm not sure how you think I am saying that Bitcoin is worthless. I'm not talking about you or the current bitcoin price. What I am saying is that if you invest 100$ at 1$ per coin and the price of the coin drops to 0.5$, then now you've lost the capacity to cash out your original 100$ as you can only cash out for 50$ now. i.e. you've lost money because the price dropped.

Can you two stop winking at each other? It's getting weird.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:31:18
I see, that sounds interesting. I suppose a large hurdle for them will be the amount of changes that they will have to make to Bitcoin along the way and the resulting number of forks to get Bitcoin into that competitive state. Other coins such as IOTA, are fundamentally different from the beginning and may as a result have advantages. Even coins that still use blockchain but have a slightly different philosophy such as Litecoin and Vertcoin seem preferable. I'm definitely excited to see how Bitcoin will scale though; it's not as if I want them to fail, Bitcoin still makes up most of my crypto portfolio haha
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:18:41
That's a good point, but unless the Bitcoin devs can make it have competitive tx fees and times, I still don't see it becoming the main currency for crypto in 10 - 20 years. Like I said, I see it as digital gold.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:14:27
He's not right, and neither are you. I'm tired of seeing this nonsense phrase repeated non-stop on reddit by people trying to make each other feel better over disappointing investments. Grow a spine and accept that if the price has gone down, then you've lost the capacity to cash out what you put in i.e. you've lost money. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:39:32
A popular way to look at Bitcoin recently has been as "digital gold" rather than a currency. In its current state, Bitcoin transaction fees are too high and take too long compared to altcoins currencies such as Dash, Litecoin, and even Bitcoin Cash.

Prime example of curve fitting. Test out a bunch of SMA lengths, see which seems to indicate a pattern, and then claim that you've found something special. In reality, you've found nothing. This is bogus.

Absolutely, BTC Markets to mention a big one.
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:50:09
Oh I see, I must have misunderstood OP. I did mean that BTC Markets charge GST, which they do on their commission.
@_date: 2017-09-10 04:45:44
Coinbase - 4% fee - Haven't had any issues here. Relatively high fees, but instant purchases. Pretty stupid weekly limit though of 300$ for myself, though my friend for some reason has a 500$ limit. I guess they gradually increase it as you remain as customer.
Coinjar - 1% fee - It seems that you have to transfer money to your CoinJar account before you can buy any bitcoin from them. This can be done for a fee instantly for certain banks or over a few business days with BPay which may cause you to miss out on dips. 
BTC Markets - starts at 0.85% fee and reduces as your monthly volume increases. Still waiting on verification from them so I haven't used them yet but I heard they're solid enough.

Didn't a redditor post this here a couple of weeks ago and now this is getting reposted but with a shitty investing.com logo on top of it like they own it?
@_date: 2017-09-13 09:46:43
Electrum should have given you 12 words (your seed) when you created your wallets that you should have written down somewhere, perhaps on a piece of paper. If your computer ever dies then you can simply redownload electrum on another computer, and instead of checking "create a new wallet" you can instead check "create existing wallet from seed" or something like that, then enter your seed and it will recover your wallet. In other words, if you have your seed written down somewhere, you have your "backup" already.

Doesn't that Patriot Act notice kinda get rid of one of the big advantages of bitcoin (privacy)?

Any recommendations for Australian users to buy with fiat? Gemini is unavailable here and Coinbase and CEX.IO have much higher prices than non-fiat exchanges seem to indicate.
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:56:31
Too bad the exchanges have been taking their sweet ass time verifying my details so it seems like I'll be missing out...
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:54:21
Ah right, so the whole verification process that actually allows you to buy crypto? Gotcha, thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:46:04
You seem to be right, my bad. Just seemed a bit suspect cause this was definitely posted here a week ago without the logo on it so this post did look a bit dodgy.
Carry on.

Fuck off with this stupid macho shit. Being careful and skeptical is not "having no balls", it's having a brain. OP is being smart by dipping his toes in and learning more about the space before he gets more invested. Piss off.

There's a difference between cashing out 20,000$ and 500,000$. When your bitcoin is worth 10s of thousands, it doesn't mean much to cash out. It's a nice sum of course, but nothing life changing. Cashing out half a million dollars, though...

Survivorship bias. You only say this because the price has continued up and it's easy to say in hindsight. Had the price gone down and never really gone anywhere afterwards, you would have regretted that approach. Better safe than sorry.
