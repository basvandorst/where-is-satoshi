let me start saying that I'm not affiliate with any of the crypto lending companies... otherwise  "someone" can accuse me of advertising services....
Exchange lendbots work using an API key that you generate, with only permissions to make lends. No  withdrawal of funds or trading is possible with these credentials. If you are familiar with automated trading bots, than you have the idea. 
Other services, like Compound, Dharma, etc.. work with ETH smart contracts (so not with BTC) that are opensource, so you can check how they work. Basically,  you are lending coins to a smart  contract, and someone else will borrow them putting enough "collateral" as a form of insurance to repay the debt in case of default of the borrower. Policies for withdrawal can be different: some services allow you to withdraw you lended money at any moment, some other "locks" the money in the contract for some days.

I can't connect to the node at the moment. Is it still alive? Feel free to connect to mine: 039401f72bc0d40efb58b01de15527a2a5ae1943d7c29067b725a1467a93c7e66f

I respect your opinion, but maybe you have to do your homework first and study how the lending bots work. Here is a quick recap for you... you lend your crypto to an exchange (bitmex, bittrex, etc..) where someone else will borrow them at an higher interest rate. Who is this "someone"? people that is trading with leverage, willing to pay fees like 0.0821% every 8 hours.... so... I don't see any ponzi scheme here.
btw, I'm not affiliate to coinlend in any way and I don't care about your opinion on them.
I'm just saying that, it's nice to see all the tech development that are running on LN, but I think that to have a mass adoption there must be an economic advantage for LN nodes owners, and I don't see this economic advantage.
 \- fees are super low: if I'm not mistaken, the owner of LNBig declared a few month ago the he's earning about 1-2$ per month of routing fees...
\- a individual willing to invest some crypto, can use several financial services, decentralized (BlockFi, Compound, Dharma, etc..) or not (lending bots etc..) to earn passive interests while keeping his crypto. The last thing I will do is to operate a LN node.

with lending bots, you don't send money to random website: you authorize a bot to find the best opportunity to lend money on crypto exchanges, where someone else will borrow them (at higher rate) to make some leveraging.

You still not answering my question: what is the economic incentive to run a LN node? Are you able to answer?
