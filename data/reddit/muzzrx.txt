Mate the network was being intentionally spammed by roger, Jihan and co to push the bcash narrative. Fees were artificially high. This is well documented.

I just did my Tax return in Aussie. I mentioned BTC and she said she had no idea where it stands right now. So I'm thinking its not something the ATO Actively looks at right now. Unless of course, You are Satoshi aka Craig Wright lol
