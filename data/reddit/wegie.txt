I’m curious if you get audited just bc you’re on that list.

Smart contracts and anything besides ledger updates for that matter on bitcoin are only "hacks". Ethereum was actually made for smart contracts.

Lol, just remember all the innovation built on bitcoin is a "hack" and is not what the blockchain was built for, why do you think the lightning network has taken so long? Ethereums raiden network has beaten the lightning network to the punch

Antpool could pull off a 51% attack on BU quite easily..

See Ethereum, which will be scalable to compete with Visa in transactions per second as soon as Serenity is reached. The devs of this community are incredible.

Check Ethereum's roadmap and metropolis. Scalability is one of ETH's many future developments.

They increase their revenue from higher volume on any of their coins. That's the point of an advertisement.

I don't believe Bitcoin has the option to hardfork, too many immutability maximalists that will scorn the idea and take out their frustration on the price which will take maybe a decade to recover from. A significant price decline from here on out will do serious harm to all the normal people in China/India/Argentina who have bought bitcoin as inflation protection. Unlike Ethereum, bitcoin does not have the leadership to navigate through the tough times and doubt that occurs after a fork. If there are two coins created (which there definitely will be since it is a huge pump and dump opportunity for traders), I don't think bitcoin will ever be the same. Bitcoin is better off accepting its short comings, since it's only real advantages are 1) size/liquidity 2) immutability 3) being first to market. 
Good luck!

What exactly is it valuable for? It is NOT useful as a currency due to the scalability limitations. It's only use case today is as a store of value or "digital gold". Bitcoin wastes billions of dollars per year on electricity to secure the network, only a POStake type crypto can solve these problems of scalability and electricity. Best solution thus far imho is Ethereum.

Ethereum was not created to be a currency, just a economic means of using the Ethereum world wide computer. Thing is, Ethereum just so happened to also create the most viable cryptocurrency so far as a by product. It is transferable much faster, with 13 second block times vs bitcoins 11minutes and will go down to 3 sec block times with upcoming roadmap to Serenity POS. 
You can see with the 100k backlogged bitcoin transactions that bitcoin is not a viable currency, just store of value. In 2017 Ethereum will be capable of handling as many transactions per second as Visa, and ethereum is only 1 year old.

The one advantage bitcoin has is it was first to market, and therefore much more widely known. The recent spikes in BTC are due to currency devaluations in India and China, people there haven't heard about Ethereum yet
@_date: 2016-11-20 15:14:44
I think you got those backwards. Bitcoin is a distributed ledger that isn't capable of much other than transferring coins.. and even at that it is only capable of handling 2 transactions per second. Bitcoin has no core dev team that is capable of solving these problems or a community that can agree on anything. The sedwig and BU forks have taken like 5 years to get this far and still can't be agreed on. Look at all the large corporations currently using Ethereum. A Swiss broker dealer is using the public ETH chain to settle bond transactions for example, and it has only been around 1 year.

Not true. They accept USD. The app exchanges the crypto for cash and give the merchant cash.
