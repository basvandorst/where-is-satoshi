People with a long-term investing horizon are already using it as a store of value, and it is working out tremendously for them.
The volatility argument sort of drives me nuts. Yes, its price is extremely volatile (though, for the record, trending in an incredible direction). But that volatility is decreasing over time, and if Bitcoin continues to grow in value, that volatility will only continue to go down. As it becomes more mature, its price will stabilize. The larger it is, the harder it will be to move its value.  
You are literally watching the birthing of a new currency, one with no explicit government backing. A new asset class. This is uncharted territory. Of course it's going to be volatile at the outset! But just because it's volatile today doesn't mean it's destined to be volatile forever.
In the meantime, those who can afford to invest long-term have the opportunity to ride out the early-stage volatility and reap the benefits of that essentially exponential price growth. While the majority will miss out entirely : )

Well, that's not really true for the most likely Bitcoin ETF, the SolidX one. One share represents something like 35 BTC... It's really geared towards institutional investors. The inability for average Joe's to buy in and be 'victims to market manipulation and speculation,' or whatever, is part of the reason people are so optimistic that it will be approved, as compared to other BTC ETFs
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:59:54
This just misses the point completely. Nobody was requesting it because it was assumed by anyone with any shred of intelligence that of course, *of course* they'd be implementing a live solution to help reduce the very thing that Coinbase has been griping about so openly. It should be common sense. It's astounding that it's taken them this long.

Thanks for the response. 


Interesting clarification. The fact that so few people understand this might suggest a communication breakdown (not surprising in this vitriolic environment). I understood it to be a de facto capacity increase, while not technically increasing the 1 MB blocksize limit. 
But I still think what you're going to find is that trying to explain this to BU proponents is going to fall on deaf ears. I really think a big part of it comes down to the psychology of a negotiation. For it to be successful, both sides need to feel like they gained something, even if neither side feels entirely satisfied. The problem you guys are running into is that Segwit--even despite any capacity increases that may come with it--is seen by the pro-BU crowd as what Core wants. So adopting Segwit, without any promise of a future HF blocksize increase, just feels to them like Core is getting what they want, and that they're being over-ruled. The BU folks are not going to be satisfied by that, no matter how much you try to appeal to their better judgment, self-interest, etc. And the more you makes appeals like those in your original post, the more they will likely dig their heels in.
Again, do I agree with BU proponents' perspective? No. But I guess what I'm trying to convey is that to them, it feels like you're talking past them.
Perhaps I'm over-simplifying, and I hope I'm wrong, but as more time goes by, it feels like this gets resolved one of two ways:
1) Core approaches this as a negotiation, and concedes some small HF increase (perhaps not an immediate one, but nevertheless a firm promise to do one), as a quid pro quo for Segwit. If I'm Core, my motivation for doing this would primarily be to open the door for 2nd layer solutions, which hopefully can flourish and potentially obviate the need for any additional HF increases.
2) Understanding that  may be a bad precedent to set (effectively politicizing bitcoin, and in the process jeopardizing some of its vital attributes), let the pro-BU folks fork off onto their own chain. A mutual parting of ways, with all the short-term pain, confusion, and instability that would come with it.
Absent one of these two approaches--neither of which are entirely palatable--I just struggle to see an end to the divisiveness. 
Anyway, I'll end by reiterating that I am sympathetic to the challenging spot you guys are in, and appreciate the work you do. I believe Core is doing what's best for bitcoin, and find regrettable the amount of negativity being sent your way. Good luck.

Actually this ETF would not be insured. The SolidX one and possibly Silbert's ETF would, though.
@_date: 2017-02-08 17:48:09
Sure it does. Maybe we're just defining immutability differently.
What I was referring to is how a subset of people in r/bitcoin are of the mindset that ANY hard fork should be opposed on principal. Essentially it's a slippery-slope argument that if you allow one HF (especially one that is politically motivated), you open the door for others, ones that could even more obviously hinder decentralization or other traits that make bitcoin special, and that are pushed through via strong-arm/political tactics by motivated parties who may not have bitcoin's best interest in mind. 
Then I think there are folks who are not quite as extreme as that, and are open to HFs, but still wouldn't want to do them if they were primarily for political reasons (e.g., like the 2 MB blocksize HF 'olive branch' I alluded to in my comment above). They want to keep politics out of these types of decisions, and rather HFs be purely for technical motivations, which I can certainly understand and appreciate.

That's fair, though I'd probably be more worried about bitcoin futures  (on traditional exchanges like CME, not the OKCoin variety) than I would be about options on COIN.
Either way, eventually mainstream solutions will exist to get exposure to BTC without direct investment in it, which will allow for some price manipulation. But as long as use cases exist for people to want to hold actual coin (beyond mere investment), that demand should help ensure that the price isn't completely driven by speculation. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:33:42
Responding to my own post for a small diatribe...
While I agree with Core's view on this whole issue, you guys have to see that these repeated appeals that amount to you saying "this is what's right and prudent for bitcoin" just aren't making an impact. No matter how many times you say it, or how eloquently.
To the people you disagree with, this just comes off as some combination of patronizing, self-interested (Blockstream wants small blocks to profit off LN/sidechains, yadda yadda), or heretical (Satoshi said we should have big blocks!).
Feel free to keep banging your heads against that wall, but at some point you may really have to start thinking about a compromise point.
Core rightly points out that Segwit is an effective block size increase, but people may not be truly satisfied until you guys lay out a concrete HF roadmap. *Even if it's just a token increase to 2 MB.* I strongly believe that the symbolism of that olive branch, even for such a token increase, would mend a lot of fences.
That may ultimately be the only way that we get some (at least temporary) closure on this issue. The hope there would be to placate people enough to buy time to get Segwit adopted, then allow LN (and possibly sidechains?) to do their thing, and actually be able to demonstrate that trustless 2nd layer solutions can provide meaningful scaling.
That said, I appreciate the resistance to going down that route. For one, it's very well possible that this would only be a stopgap solution, and that folks may want more blocksize increases even after 2nd layer solutions are implemented. 
And perhaps even more importantly, I also understand the reluctance to bend on immutability in the name of politics.
But then I go back to a point in my original comment--if one side insists upon a HF blocksize increase, and another firmly opposes that as an unacceptable compromise to immutability, then there really may be no room for compromise, and a split may be the best outcome in the long run. The "rip the band-aid off" approach. If that jeopardizes the ETF, maybe so be it?
Anyway, just some thoughts I wanted to put out there...
@_date: 2017-02-06 14:52:24
No, no, no. Futures are NOT necessarily a good thing. In fact, I would view them as a net negative (though unfortunately probably inevitable).
Futures just mean that people can get the price exposure they're looking for simply by trading paper contracts, without any actual need to go out and own the underlying asset. This does nothing to benefit long-term holders; worse, it just means that the tail can wag the dog, as paper futures volumes can dwarf the volumes of 'physical' bitcoin trades (e.g., buying/selling on bitcoin exchanges), and wind up driving bitcoin's price (see: gold).
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:28:20
you missed the implied /s
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:01:13
Big difference--these ETFs will actually hold and be backed by bitcoin. Unlike many gold ETFs which don't actually hold gold. Moreover, it's really the gold futures contracts which drive the price of gold, not ETFs. The problem with those futures is that they are just paper that gets financially settled, and don't actually drive any real demand for gold. But here with COIN you have a fund that is truly buying and holding bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-15 17:32:21
If the network really did split into two separate, surviving coins as the result of an HF, why would that necessarily mean loss of immutability and the 21 million cap?
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:08:06
Did I say they shouldn't be allowed? 
My comment was in response to someone who was saying that bitcoin futures would be a huge boon for the price of bitcoin. My point is that this isn't necessarily the case, and could even be a detriment. Futures are not necessarily a bitcoin holder's friend, certainly not the same way that an ETF investing in actual BTC is.
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:16:57
Two cents from a nobody:
Adam--I'm a fan of yours, and I'll start with a huge thank you for all the work you've done over the years. I also realize that you guys are in a tough spot, and have to weather a tremendous amount of negativity, so kudos for the patience and resolve you've shown over the years.
I'll also say that I am supportive of Core's vision for bitcoin, and the emphasis on preserving decentralization as much as possible.
That said, some constructive criticism--you have to realize that on the whole, your message will not be well received by the very people you're trying to persuade. In fact, rather than bring folks together, it's only liable to do the opposite.
First, as others have noted, you start by posing a false dichotomy. Surely, there are more than two options here. It's not even an accurate dichotomy at that, since it's far from guaranteed that an ETF will be approved anytime soon, regardless of whether a contentious fork happens or not.
You can also be sure that those on the other side will retort with "it's not about the price, it's about the principal," etc. So appealing to them about the ETF is almost definitely counterproductive on the whole.
For these reasons, people are going to tune out the message after that intro.
And beyond that, people are just going to see your post as more of the same. Right or wrong, they're going to summarize it as you saying: "after segwit, schnorr sigs, lightning, and weak blocks, *maybe* we'll do a hard fork." That's just going to reaffirm in their minds that Core has no intention of really doing a hard fork (whether right or wrong). 
Beyond that, you're just trying to appeal to their better judgment, but that's like a Republican appealing to a Democrat (or vice versa) to get them to change sides of the aisle. It just ain't happening. Both sides are firmly entrenched, believe they are in the right, and often assign an almost moral type of quality to that belief.
Sadly, I do not know how this blocksize issue gets resolved. I almost think that a hard fork may be inevitable, and at times I wonder if it wouldn't be the best thing for both sides in the long term.

Is it possible to encumber a public address with a rule that says "reject transactions attempting to send bitcoin to this address for amounts over X"?

Could X be dynamically adjusting, e.g., tied to the USD exchange rate so that X could effectively be tied to a specific US$ amount?

Yeah, I do find it a bit troubling. As I noted in another comment just now, I'm at least somewhat encouraged by the fact that the forthcoming LedgerX platform will require full collateralization (per  Although not sure how that relates to what the CBOE will be doing. 
As long as these derivs can simply be cash settled without either party ever taking ownership of the underlying, this is not the recipe for a moonshot. There will need to be demand for the real thing, which is one reason I was hopeful for the ETF, since it would have been holding the underlying.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:53:05
Not totally sure I understand your comment, but what u/constructorx is getting at is that the underlying commodity never actually needs to trade hands. It's basically a Contract for Differences. When the contract expires, it's settled by one party (the party that realized a loss) making a cash payment to the other (the party that realized a gain). 
Paper derivatives now dominate gold/silver trading, dwarfing the amount of physical gold/silver trading. So it's a tail wagging the dog type of dynamic--derivatives trading drives the price of gold/silver far moreso than trading physical.
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:38:38
I'm no expert, and I think it depends. I believe derivatives contracts vary as far as whether or not they allow for physical and/or cash settlement. I think the scenario you described can happen, but I believe in practice they virtually always settle in cash.
Although this article talks about positions that can settle in cash, one thing that gives me some hope (although admittedly I don't think much of the details have been released yet) is that the LedgerX platform that recently got the green light from the CFTC does apparently require full collateralization (see  - one of the guys posting in that thread, u/kanzure, works for LedgerX).

ELI5 for a layman--on the face of it, I would think that this would result in significant mining centralization, even on the "canonical" 1 MB block chain. Essentially, it would put miners at a disadvantage to not mine both chains if a lot of everyday transaction volume moves to the extension block. But you don't seem to highlight that as a concern, so I'm assuming I'm missing something... can you shed some light?
Edit: also, with extension blocks, is it the case that nodes/miners can avoid seeing the transactions on the extension block? I'm specifically wondering about bandwidth requirements. Say a node/miner doesn't want to be encumbered by having to see/relay all the transactions happening on the extension block (that is, other than the transactions that move coins to/from the extension block)--can they do this? Or will they be forced to see all the transactions happening on the extension block, and thus have to have the bandwidth necessary to receive them?
@_date: 2017-04-04 20:52:19


Thanks for the response. But I guess I'm still missing something regarding that last sentence there. Let's say hypothetically the extblocks are 100 MB in size, and it gets to a point where a large portion of the transactions on the network are happening on the extension. 
This would seem to have massive implications for centralization of both full nodes and miners, while creating security risks even for the 1 MB chain. A full node only validating the 1 MB chain would seemingly be pretty worthless, b/c they're essentially just acting as an SPV node for the vast majority of the t(x) on the network. With so much of the t(x) volume happening on the extension, a full node would have to also validate transactions on the extension in order for it to be useful, no? If nothing else, I would expect to see fewer full nodes, even just for the 1 MB chain (especially if they need enough bandwidth to see all the transactions on the extension, even if they don't intend to validate them). And are there risks created by the fact that main-chain-only full nodes are going to be SPV'ing such a large portion of the t(x) set? Is this the fork risk you alluded to? Not an expert so I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just feels like these things have to have negative security implications even for the main chain. 
And sounds like you don't disagree as far as this further centralizing mining--seems like there'd be a huge fee incentive to mine the extension. 
Overall, this extblock idea just feels like a slippery slope with potential to decrease security and decentralization even on the main 1 MB chain... am I thinking about that wrong?

A couple other points here. First, a prediction: don't be surprised to see some exchanges, possibly even Coinbase/Gdax, take this a step further--since, in their mind, "accumulated difficulty" is what matters most, and since miners are mostly signaling S2X, they can assert that S2X is technically *already* Bitcoin, and consequently "justify" denoting S2X as Bitcoin from the moment the fork happens.
But regardless, you need to realize that exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini are setting an extremely low bar for S2X to earn the Bitcoin monicker. Miners need only mine S2X for a few days in order for it to meet these exchanges' criteria. 
At least Coinbase allows for the possibility of considering other metrics... Gemini's policy is extremely troubling. They're most likely going to wind up calling S2X Bitcoin, unless you really believe that miners will just *immediately* bail on S2X. So what happens after that if (more likely, I believe, *when*) it becomes clear that the market, the user base, and nodes are not on board with S2X, and miners eventually cave and follow value... then what happens? Exchanges will flip back to calling S1X "Bitcoin"? 
How goddamn confusing will that be? This is all such an avoidable cluster, but these guys are intent on driving this change through, consequences be damned. The Coinbases and Bitpays of the world are taking on a huge amount of reputational risk by sticking to this consensus-lacking hard fork, and I can't help but think they'll eventually regret it.

How are you measuring support for larger blocks? You often remark to the effect that the only people upset about S2X are those posting on r/bitcoin. I think that's a gross over-simplification; ignoring, for instance: most devs, the majority of nodes, Bitmex and other businesses, B1X/B2X token pricing, etc.
Do larger blocks have consensus? Seems pretty muddy to me. To wit, here's about as objective a poll as any that you'll find, via Coindesk:  (can't provide hyperlink since it's just one of many polls that randomly pop up every time you go to Coindesk)
36% of respondents believe S2X is good for Bitcoin. Not even a simple majority. Of course, you might respond by pointing out that the "no" vote in that survey was even less, at just 30%. But see, here's the thing: 64% of respondents are either in the "no" or "undecided" camps. Those undecideds are crucial, because inertia is not on your side: a lot of them are likely to sit on the fence, but since your fork would require them to actively update their software, you are unlikely to capture the majority of them. In light of that, how can you even begin to argue that this fork isn't going to be extremely divisive and contentious? Which leads me to my next point...


It's exactly the method that is so troubling. Do you not see the difference between the tact the NYA signatories are taking with this HF, as compared to the approach Bitcoin Cash took? The latter is in keeping with the notion of letting the market decide; the former is something entirely different.
You are actively trying to force a change upon Bitcoin, one that  maybe ~1/3 of the community seems to actively support. Rather than offer a new, competing option, NYA attempts to usurp and redefine what Bitcoin is, purposely leaving out features like replay protection for the very deliberate reason of increasing the likelihood that this change gets forced through. Can you really wonder why so many here perceive this as an attack?
The NYA signatories are the ones initiating this fork, and as such, they are the drivers of this contentious change. I would argue that the onus is on you and the other signatories, then, to ensure meaningful consensus, in the name of good faith &amp; respecting the desires of the broader community.
Look, I know I'm not liable to convince you. But Erik, I think people target you so much in particular because they believe that you--more than any of the other signatories--share their beliefs and their idealism around decentralized currency and free markets.  So they're baffled and upset by your support of this heavy-handed, and largely closed-door, approach to implementing this change. S2X might be a compromise in your mind, but at what cost?
Sorry for the novel.

Thank you. I really appreciate this stance, including the recognition that consensus is not merely a matter of hashrate support. This is sensible, and although I am not a proponent of S2X (as you well know after today!), I can get on board with this approach.

My man! Thank you.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:43:04
First, I do appreciate your response. 
That said... I'm sorry, but when I see a response like this, I almost have to wonder if you're being deliberately obtuse. 
Per the latest blog post: 
"We are going to call the chain with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin."
That is *not* letting the market decide, that's letting miners decide! 
It'd be one thing if the post said: we're going to weigh a variety of different factors, hash rate being one of them, to reach a conclusion about which chain truly has consensus. But that's very different than leading with a comment about letting hashrate decide, then following it up with a halfhearted comment to the effect of "oh hey, we *might* decide to look at other factors." 
You have to understand why people would view that post as an implicit endorsement of S2X; since, after all, the one ace it has up its sleeve right now is miner signaling! Because it surely does *not* have most everything else, including node count, dev support, B1X/B2X price signaling, or broad consensus from businesses and users (see, for instance, this poll:  [in the banner on the right side]),  etc.
Lastly, can you clarify one thing? Let's assume for a second that up until the moment of the fork, the majority of miners are still signaling for S2X. Under that scenario, *immediately* after the fork, would legacy Bitcoin still be denoted as "Bitcoin" on Coinbase? Or is Coinbase going to take the stance that S2X will be labeled Bitcoin right out the gates, because miner signaling suggests that S2X will meet the "most accumulated difficulty" condition per the blog post?
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:36:44
Good find. Damn--66% S1X based on 6k+ votes. Encouraging!
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:36:13


I realize that my comment may have been a bit confusing. Anywhere that I said 'larger blocks,' I'm really specifically referring to S2X.
Believe me, I'm no opponent of larger blocks. In fact, on the face of it, S2X is a perfectly sensible compromise, and one that--had it been handled differently, more constructively--I would've been entirely on board with.
But again, I go back to the method--that's what's so unfortunate and problematic about S2X. While a majority of users support an eventual blocksize increase, it is pretty apparent that there is far from a consensus around S2X (again, I point to the Coindesk poll I linked showing just 36% support... and of course lack of node &amp; dev support, B1X token pricing, etc.). People have a variety of legitimate reasons to be concerned about it, even if they support increasing block size--too hasty, lack of broad consensus, too little dev support, no replay protection, etc. And yet, despite that lack of strong consensus, S2X is nevertheless being driven through by miners and a relatively small group of businesses that happen to command significant sway (regardless of whether or not their user base broadly supports S2X, for whatever that's worth). 
Don't get me wrong, I'm sympathetic to the impact that higher fees have on businesses like yours, so I don't fault you for taking steps to alleviate that... but is this really the most constructive way to do it? It just seems so undeniably out of keeping with the spirit of decentralized consensus upon which this community is built, and I think that's really regrettable.


But this is tantamount to saying 'look, I'm going to help coordinate a hostile takeover of bitcoin that a large swath of the community is opposed to, but if that fails, it's all good and I'll concede defeat.'
And as far as letting the market decide... I'm fine with that concept, but realize that when Coinbase says their first criteria will be hash rate, and that things like price will be secondary... well, that's something very different.
As far as your comments about how unfortunate this debate is... I'm with ya man! Preaching to the choir. And I don't disagree about wishing Core had handled this better too. But two wrongs don't make a right.
Anyway, your input &amp; thoughtfulness is definitely appreciated.
On a lighter note--favorite Final Fantasy?? I think either Tactics or 7 would get the nod from me, although you could easily make a case for 4 and 6. My Final Fantasy Mt. Rushmore, if you will. Tactics also takes the cake for my favorite FF soundtrack... what a gem.
Edit: I saw another comment of yours about how Shapeshift plans on handling the fork. It is an entirely reasonable policy, and under that lens, S2X feels less like a hostile takeover. If other NYA signatories took a similar tact, I could happily live with that approach.

But why though? See my comment here:

Sadly, I completely agree. I'm not looking forward to this at all...
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:18:51
It sucks. 
Interestingly, their policy for this fork is pretty much exactly how the twins were also proposing to handle forks for their ETF.
This seems almost certainly like a bad idea on their part. Seems like there's a damn good chance that S2X will have enough hashpower during the first 48 hours to be the longest chain for Gemini's purpose, only to fizzle out shortly thereafter. Then what? The ensuing shitshow, and the disgruntled customers that would accompany it, surely wouldn't be a good look for Gemini, and in turn it also won't do anything to help their ETF's approval prospects. Which sucks, cause I really want the damn thing approved!
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:58:36
Well put.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:37:45


You nailed it. This is exactly the problem. If/when the cash-settled futures market dwarfs the market for 'physical' bitcoin, then guess which one dictates the price? Which sucks, because as you noted elsewhere, there is no concept of scarcity (a la bitcoin's 21MM cap) in these futures markets... the market can short as much as they damn well please.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:38:17
It really warrants clarification at this point. As best I can tell, right out the gates the existing chain will be called BTC, but if over the course of the first few days miners are mining S2X more than S1X, they will change the name. Or maybe not, depending on their respective prices, or community outcry, or God knows what else. Entirely vague.
As I mentioned in my other comment, I think they may also come out and say that S2X is BTC from the moment the fork happens: since their main rule is "most accumulated difficulty" and since most miners are signaling for S2X, they can presume at the outset that S2X will have the most difficulty.
Who knows. Confusion abounds.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:31:47


But why would someone do this?
I could understand two scenarios: 
1) Someone already has 1 BTC and are looking to hedge it by selling it forward. But in this case, they're not creating any sort of buying pressure for the underlying, because they already own it (or perhaps they expect to generate it from future mining proceeds)
2) They're just looking to speculate on BTC and want to short it. In which case, they really would just sell 1 BTC via futures, and wouldn't be looking to offset that risk (so they wouldn't go out and buy 1 'physical' BTC).
But why would they sell 1 BTC via futures, and then buy 1 BTC? What are they accomplishing? Maybe arb'ing difference between spot and futures, okay. But what else?
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:33:04
Erik, despite our disagreements on this subject, I have a lot of love for you. But... whoosh : )
My first point was that Coinbase saying "they will let the market decide" is a bit disingenuous, considering that what they're primarily contemplating is letting hashrate decide. Those are two very different things.
That said, my second point that you quoted is that I *do* believe the market--the actual market, not 51% of miners--will ultimately decide in favor of legacy Bitcoin, regardless of what certain exchanges decide to name it. And in the face of that clear market preference, miners will eventually cave by doing what Bitcoin's game theory predicts they will do: follow value.
But boy I wish you and the rest of the NYA crew would cave first to avoid this messy debacle. I just can't believe you see no issue with supporting such a contentious fork : /
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:19:15
Well, this is extremely disappointing. And a complete 180. What the hell?
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:50:42
Comic relief, if not for the poor saps getting scammed into investing in it : /
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:38:24
I suspect we may be entering into an ugly, messy stretch here, but the glass half full response to your comment is that *when* (not if) Bitcoin emerges from this attack (as you rightly called it), it's going to emerge stronger than ever, having proved its resiliency against the most significant threat it's faced yet. That'd be something to get extremely excited about : )
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:01:16
You can't control it now, but won't it be in your hands eventually? Whether through the coins going to you as shareholder, or you choosing to move towards civil rehabilitation?
Are you saying that if you go the civil rehab route, there's a chance that the courts (arbitrators?) could insist that things be disbursed via fiat?
Also... If the bankruptcy claims have been satisfied, the trustee shouldn't be planning on any further sales, right?
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:26:01
Coinbase, judging by their blog post where they say they're going to prioritize the chain with "most accumulated difficulty." 
I think that comment fairly well sums up my concern with Coinbase's blog post. Yeah, I know, they made a secondary reference to how they'll also consider price, community sentiment, etc. But for those of us worried about S2X, for Coinbase to prioritize near-term hashrate--really the one metric that clearly shows support for S2X--just feels very... deliberate. 
I won't rule out the possibility that I'm being paranoid, but it certainly makes me wary of Coinbase's intentions.
And that's also the same approach Gemini is taking, although I realize they're not an NYA signatory.

@_date: 2017-07-19 20:06:34
F2Pool is killing us this period so far, they've been way outperforming their relative hash rate.
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:43:36
From my understanding, LN is possible without SW, but with significantly impaired functionality, to the point where it doesn't really make much economic sense. For instance, I believe that without SW, both sides would need to fund the channel (even if the intent is only for the channel to go in one direction, i.e. customer paying merchant), which is a pretty huge drawback.
So while you don't literally need SW to do LN, practically speaking you absolutely do. I believe a lot of the issues are caused by transaction malleability.

Pretty cringeworthy stuff there, and no, you're not like every other person here
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:18:18
The periods have been determined in advance. One such period started last night, and will run through sometime Friday morning (US). In total, 269 blocks (80%) during that 336 block period need to signal for Segwit via BIP91 in order for it to lock in. If we fail to hit that threshold, we'll get another chance in the next period, which would start Friday morning and run through Sunday afternoon/evening (336 blocks corresponds to about 56 hours, on average)
@_date: 2019-05-22 12:32:07
Confused by this comment. The comment you're responding to references multisig, which if widely implemented would prevent fractional reserve banking
@_date: 2019-05-22 12:32:36
Not if multisig is the norm
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:20:17
I'm standing in that weird place next to you. I hear ya.
Appreciate the clarification on the 2x vs. 2MB. I was neglecting that detail. And that is certainly a pretty big difference, especially in the near-term. Segwit 2x is definitely not ideal, but at this point, I'm willing to live with it in the interest of moving forward.
@_date: 2019-05-06 16:37:27
From what I've read, this is not the case at all.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:35:51
This is pretty much the way to go. But as you alluded to, trying to maintain a spreadsheet like this if you're an active trader could be a pain in the ass of colossal proportions. Especially if you're actively trading between cryptos, and the IRS does in fact deem such trades to *not* be like-kind exchanges.
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:17:23
Well, the title is misleading. Based on the last ~day's worth of blocks, we're just above the 80% threshold needed, but the way it actually works is that it needs to be above this 80% threshold throughout certain predefined periods of 336 blocks. One of those periods started last night, and will close sometime Friday morning (US). If we fail to exceed 80% during the period, a new period will begin. 
As long as that lock-in happens before Aug 1, there's much less risk of a split happening (I won't say no risk, however, because the mining pool ViaBTC apparently intends to lead the charge on a hard fork to a chain that will support larger blocks on Aug 1, as I understand it--however, what happens with that is a pretty large unknown at this point). 
Now, even once lock-in happens, Segwit doesn't get implemented right away. The long story short is that it would ultimately get implemented in about a month. 
If all goes as it seems to be playing out, then you should be okay leaving your coins on an exchange, but as a general rule of thumb, that is never a good recipe for security, and is generally not advised, especially in this environment where there is an unusually high possibility for a split. Remember that even if a split doesn't happen Aug 1, there's still a pretty good chance one might happen in a few months from now when the '2x' part of Segwit2x is set to be rolled out.
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:27:51
No, Coinbase is a better bet as a wallet than keeping your money on an exchange. If you're new to bitcoin, it's not the worst thing in the world to store your coins on Coinbase using their 'Vault' feature, which provides some additional layers of security, although note that your funds will be harder to access--e.g., you need to put in a request to take coins out of your Vault, and have to wait 48 hours before they're released to you.
Recommending the use of Coinbase for storing coins is considered heresy by most folks around here, since by storing coins with them (or any 3rd party, like an exchange) you are actually giving them control of the coins, and really getting an IOU from them in return. That said, I still think it's a reasonable option for beginners, especially for relatively small dollar amounts.
From there, you'll probably want to graduate to things like hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger or Trezor). 
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:59:39
I tend to agree, but on the flipside, what happens if the vast majority of Core devs also decide not to support the 2x HF? Sure, 2x can move on without them, but at the same time, the devs carry considerable influence, and their reservations may cause many users and businesses to opt against the HF as well. 
I've seen others predict that this will be similar to ETC/ETH, but the big difference is that virtually all the major developers stuck w/ ETH. Doesn't seem like that'll be the case w/ 2x, and I would be hesitant to underestimate the importance of that. This could get extremely contentious, and the minority may be much larger than you think.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:15:25
Kraken sucks. I trust them, but their platform cannot handle even remotely high traffic volumes. Good luck getting an order through when it's busy.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:07:37
Are you talking about on Coinbase? Their fees are pretty insane these days, in addition to what appears to be a pretty wide bid-ask spread. If you have access to their exchange, Gdax (or really any exchange, but if you already have Coinbase, you're basically already set up on Gdax), I would recommend using that instead. It's pretty easy to use, and if you use a limit order, you don't get charged any fees. Even if you use a market order, the fees will still be much lower than Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:03:09
Man, if I knew that, I'd be too busy trading to respond to reddit posts! 
My best guess is that price should continue to respond positively--potentially significantly so--as Segwit activation becomes more and more likely. But at the same time, I could see this dipping again if/when we get closer to the date when the '2x' hard fork is supposed to happen (i.e., this fall). That fork is liable to be pretty contentious. It will create a great deal of uncertainty, and markets hate uncertainty. 
Also, there's a chance segwit activation *could* be a classic 'buy the rumor, sell the news' sort of event. Even though I am very excited about the long-term implications for segwit and the types of solutions it enables, none of those solutions are ready to go today, and it'll take time for them to be fully developed and deployed. So for as promising as it is, segwit is unlikely to make a huge practical impact on day 1, and market may respond to that reality.
But really... who knows!
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:37:29
20% is extremely generous.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:19:57
This is one site where you can track it. As I write this, we're currently trailing: 109 out of 142 blocks (76.76%) in this period so far have signaled for Segwit2x (i.e., signaled for BIP 91). 
It's hard to answer your question, because of the randomness involved in terms of who finds the next block. Even if a particular pool controls, say, 10% of the hash rate, over the course of 336 blocks, they could wind up finding, e.g., 15% of the blocks, or 5%, or any range of outcomes. 
So far this period, F2Pool has been getting pretty damn lucky and finding a lot of blocks (well above what their ~7% share of hash rate would suggest they would find), which is unfortunate since they're not signaling Segwit : /
That said, if by this time tomorrow Slush is signaling, and BitFury and Bitcoin.com go back to signaling (they were, then stopped, apparently both due to technical issues that have been or will soon be fixed), then we at least stand a pretty good chance. Absent that, our odds are at about 30% right now to activate in this period.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:33:15
That's not an unreasonable strategy, but a possible concern there would be the IRS viewing it as suspicious that you're reporting these assets at $0 basis. Basically begging the question of how exactly did you acquire these? Through illicit activity perhaps? Governments are not too keen on unexplained wealth.
On the flipside, as long as you did have, e.g., a Coinbase purchase history you could point to, that would presumably give some air cover--i.e., 'see, I really did purchase these coins with my income, but I'm basically just being too lazy to calculate my actual basis'

Finally got around to watching this, thanks for posting. I was in need of a good recharge!
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:36:07
Welcome aboard. Just start planning ahead--it is almost certain that the price will drop below where it currently is today, probably significantly so. I don't think it'll stay that away, but be prepared for it all the same. Start thinking about what you might do under those circumstances... are you willing to ride that out, even for a year or two?
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:56:18
SW *does* provide a capacity increase.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:58:37
It's anyone's guess, but if past history is any indicator, then yeah, it will probably fall back down into the low 4 digits, or heck, possibly even sub-$1000 again. We've seen this time and again in bitcoin's history: massive bubble --&gt; massive retracement --&gt; sustained rally. Will this time be different? Maybe, but usually it's not. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm bullish both short and long-term, but I expect to give back a lot of these gains somewhere inbetween.
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:47:41
As a counterpoint to smudger, consider that in some ways, a split chain may be even more likely now. A lot of folks here on r/bitcoin, along w/ possibly many of the Core devs, may refuse to participate in the hard fork that would get us the '2x' part of Segwit2x. They are likely to be content to just have Segwit, and not want to hard fork the blocksize increase over concerns about centralization. Could get very contentious very quickly when it comes time for the HF. I suspect there to be a lot of uncertainty leading up to it, and that could have meaningful price implications.
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:46:53

Similar notion had occurred to me. I'd love to get other people's perspective on this. 
I echo observation: part of all the game theory here is based on this idea that people will perceive the UASF chain to have more inherent value because of the fact that it has SW, unlike the legacy chain. So presumably, the threat of an 'evil' SF would be diminished if it's proposing a change that is not deemed desirable. 
My fear then would be some insidious change that would appeal to the masses, but undermine decentralization--e.g., if extension blocks (which I understand is likely to exacerbate miner/node centralization) were proposed as a UASF .
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:30:37
No. Obstinately opposing a 2 MB HF that would allow us to get SW, fix t(x) malleability, and at least bring a temporary ceasefire to this awful debate that's crippled the community, robbed it of its shared excitement for bitcoin's potential, and distracted everyone from greater efforts for years now... *that* is not seeing the forest for the trees.
It's only 2 MB for crying out loud. Any bandwidth/centralization issues it causes in the near term-- if any--will be a non-issue in the long run.
If you don't like it, don't HF. Simple enough. But the non-zealots on either side of this debate want to get on with our lives already.
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:55:17
There is no way to guarantee a hard fork after Segwit. There's nothing stopping people from bailing on the HF after SW has been implemented. Things are going to get really interesting as the HF approaches...
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:12:14
As far as losing all mining rewards mined after 8/1 in the event of a reorg--I was initially thinking this too, but I'm not sure it's accurate. I believe miners can spend their reward after what, 100 blocks? So in theory, as long as they're selling their coins (e.g., to fiat) after the 100 block freeze period, then they're still going to be benefiting from mining the old chain. It's only coins mined in the 100 blocks leading up to the reorg that they would lose out on, since they wouldn't have had a chance to sell those ones yet.
Of course, anyone who bought those coins would get screwed in the event of a reorg.
And none of what I'm saying here changes the underlying point: there is a heightened risk to both miners and users for staying on the legacy chain.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:36:27
Ultimately, nothing of any consequence.
