They _haven’t_ disclosed what % of Blockstream they each own, nor how many BTC are in these time-locked bonuses… thus, you can’t and shouldn’t make such naive assumptions.
You _can_ assume that they are clever. They anticipated this criticism early on and invented the ambiguously enumerated time-locked BTC compensation as a shield of deflection. If they were _really_ sure about how successful this would make BTC relative to Blockstream, they would have taken BTC in lieu of stock. They didn’t. Some of us pay attention to incentives, and what they _do_. Others pay attention to and parrot what they _say_.
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:53:34
They don’t just altruistically throw money at you to develop Bitcoin in the best way possible. They throw money at you because you pitched them a Business Plan, a plan that can net them some return on their investment.
Now, to those who aren’t paid to see it otherwise… that plan seems to be to make layer 1 a crippled and expensive settlement layer. Thus incentivizing the migration of traffic and fees to layer 2… which they will sell you. So now you know.
The tragic part, for them, and us, is that users and investment will just migrate to other layer 1’s. This process is underway and is directly fueled by running Bitcoin at capacity before their “solution” is even available.

Austin Hill and Adam Back are famously _not_ early adopters. In Adam’s case, he dismissed it until it shot above $1k in 2013. Maxwell, as an early participant, described why Bitcoin would never work, and was perennially bearish on the price. He set out to mold it to his vision, a vision that just happens to favor a company he formed. Pieter once talked about 100MB block sizes… and quickly changed his tune once brought aboard the firm. 
Depending on what valuation you give Blockstream, I would guess that their shares are already worth more than whatever Bitcoin they may have acquired. As they don’t disclose anything, I suppose guessing is all we’ll be doing. Guessing and waiting for April.

OK, let’s go through the founders I didn’t name…
Matt Corallo - I assume he’s an early adopter. No idea if it made him a millionaire or how many shares of Blockstream he owns.
Alex Fowler - Not early adopter. Former PwC employee. 
Mark Friedenbach (maaku) - Did so well with Bitcoin he mainly worked on Freicoin.
Francesca Hall - Never heard of her before in the Bitcoin world, doubtful of early adopter status.
Erik Svenson - Founded “Dan’s Plan”, a health technology company, doubtful of early adopter status.
Jorge Timon - Early adopter, no idea how many BTC he owns. Worked on altcoins like freicoin and ripple if that is any indication.
Jonathan Wilkins - Never heard of him before in the Bitcoin world. Worked with Adam and Austin at ZKS.

Accept what? This declarative is largely unintelligible, pls rephrase. 
If the VC and legacy finance institutions just wanted to bet on the success of Bitcoin… they could just buy up a bunch of BTC ($76 mil would buy a lot) _and_ pay the best developers. They chose _not_ to do this.


No. My cynicism assumes that the values of the VC investors and the founders of Blockstream _are intimately aligned_ … in the form of pre-IPO stock grants and options.


The Blockstream developers and their VC investor’s values _are_ aligned, through joint ownership of stock, as I just explained. Their salaries are largely irrelevant in the face of the potential windfall their vested shares could bring in an eventual IPO. That’s the heart of the problem, they have more to gain/lose from the success/failure of Blockstream than they do the success/failure(stagnation) of Bitcoin.

Anybody who observed that event remembers it well. We discussed hard forking to larger block sizes for hours, without great disagreement. Pieter then presented the SFSW port from the Blockstream Elements project as the closing presentation. Immediately after, we got Gregory’s email, which became the official Core roadmap.

Uh, BIP 9 allows for miners to activate 29 separate and concurrent "soft" forks... Hard forks are opt-in, they demand your consent, soft forks subvert that consent, basically migrating to a new network while slipping a hood on your old/dissenting node.
To address your edit: It is in everyone's interest to coordinate a flag day and EB size. It makes no practical sense to fracture the network for shits and giggles, and even if a singular party wants to... they will be overruled by the majority of economically significant nodes and miners. Rational self interest is what fuels this thing, if you feel those incentives are insufficient to facilitate Nakamoto consensus, we are just wasting our time.

@_date: 2017-02-11 01:16:34
_Miners_ activated the CSV soft fork, quite quickly I might add, because it was adding uncontroversial new _functionality_. Segwit is more controversial because it makes economic changes to Bitcoin. A preferred type of node and transaction are suddenly given more space and cheaper transactions, an unprecedented new set of incentives. 
I’m not the one saying that Core consensus rules determine validity. That idea is self-referential to the point of absurdity, a point which I was hoping my sarcasm above would convey. I subscribe to Nakamoto consensus:


As for why most of the full nodes running on the network are Core nodes? The vast majority of users and investors don’t run a node. Only a small percentage of those that _do_ run a node will investigate alternative software. 
The majority simply types in bitcoin.org and is offered _only_ software that supports Core’s consensus rules. I suspect that if theymos turned the tables and offered the alternative software _only_, the majority of nodes would be running that version in a matter of months.

And you wonder why your agenda is having difficulties. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:34:52
Of course it was. The design is largely unchanged from when it was presented in Hong Kong by Pieter Wuille. 
This “segwit _is_ the capacity increase compromise” is a fairly new talking point. The HF mentioned in the agreement would not be activated for 12+ months after its release. 
The agreement was worded the way it was because they feared that Core would push “segwit only”… which we see confirmed a year later.  
They suspected, correctly, that Core has no interest in _ever_ hard forking to increase the block size. A Bitcoin network with an arbitrarily small native capacity will be used to artificially incentivize the uptake of fee-siphoning overlay networks. This isn’t about politics, it’s about business, on both sides.

Such is the opportunity that presents itself… Is there enough demand to facilitate the survival of a MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE = 1000000-4EVA keccak altcoin? maybe? It could offer segwit, thus enable lightening from the moment of PoW change. Recent surveys have shown about 10% of respondents to be opposed to ever increasing the block size, so the demand is there, apparently.

You can play gotcha games like Adam Back's signature, and the f2pool classic blocks... but that's not the important part. The important part is that you are free to reassess your position when you tire of 25% segwit approval. Be mindful that indefinite stasis is not the _only_ alternative.

If the economic majority feels the miners are intentionally bloating the chain to the detriment of the users of the system, they will value the miners' coins less, acting as an economic check on miners' decisions. Users/investors could also exercise the freedom of a flag day fork to fire the (some) miners (UASF comes to mind), or change the work function. The free market will sort that out too.


That sounds nice, and is true. In practice though, when you control the historical reference repo, and bitcoin.org (where many people have reliably downloaded binaries for a long time), _and_ control the main forums of communication... you are leveraging a sort of historical and social upgrade inertia. It's hard to know if joe user understands what changes are being made to the client, why they are being made, and that he runs that software to explicitly express support of these changes.  
@_date: 2017-03-06 02:09:51


Parading around a list of companies that are prepared, or are preparing to remain competitive when a rule change from the dominant software repo is actively released into the wild =/= endorsing it in a philosophical manner, nor is it a statement that represents the views of their customers. They are prepared, or are working on being prepared, for a possible network change, nothing less, nothing more. If you want to trot this around as a list of **recommendation and endorsement**… you need a new list, after asking each of the respondents again.

You started out ok, I agree with your first sentence. 
However, you don’t get to just wave your hands and claim the economic majority supports your position. 
Without a split being arbitrated on the exchanges… we have no concrete way of knowing _what_ the economic majority wants. We do have coin-backed voting. Yet, to date, that is all heavily slanted _against_ the “Bitcoin as a settlement layer” position.
Miners are incentivized to be a proxy for the economic majority, they desire to maximize their income which == maximizing the value of the token.
@_date: 2017-03-14 04:55:53
Miners will set minimum fees for their block space. They're not just going to build gigablocks full of free tx. 
Much of this debate relates to free market capitalist economies vs central planned command economies. 
Miners setting sliding fee scales for entry into their blocks of variable sizes is an example of a free market supply curve. 
Developers setting a static and arbitrarily small max block base size cap is an example of central planners picking a perfectly inelastic production quota. 
Not hard to see why the planners would want to do this either, many of them are shareholders in the company that is hoping to sell us the medicine for our "disease".

You don't understand.
If Core makes an offer that a majority of miners run, maintaining a lower block size limit than the BU miners... they still are in the driver's seat in terms of the defining ruleset. 
If they do a "signed in blood" flag day with a vulnerable minority of hashrate... they run the risk of becoming kings of the newest shitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:50:49
Soft forks make a new tightened consensus ruleset via miner (super) majority. If you don't have that (which current segwit implementations achieve via BIP9), you don't have a new consensus ruleset and are at risk of forking yourself off the network by trying to dictate the rules to miners. Let's not let that little detail get in the way of signing up all the newbs and rubes though.

A (real) spam attack on the native network could be used to create a cascading fee escalation if too many channels wanted to close and get out their bitcoin out of LN at the same time. Potentially the equivalent of a bank run through a small door. 
The fix for this is indefinite channel duration (which segwit facilitates), combined with RBF to manually up fees, which potentially avoids loss of funds... but could get hairy anyway, imo.

The issue is much more complex than you describe. Many miners are _very_ interested in processing more transactions at a lower cost per tx, yet they are prevented from doing this by the software running on some Bitcoin nodes. 
There is disagreement between the dominant developers and some major miners on which software path should lead us forward, and indeed disagreement on what Bitcoin actually _is_.

The downside is that if you guessed wrong, and the economic majority won't be declaring all non-segwit-signaling blocks invalid come 1 August... you've just followed a political movement to a dead-end or an altcoin.   
You could also just switch back to a consensus following client at any point before or afterwards, just be careful around the time of the fork.

@_date: 2016-09-18 01:08:02
LN will move the flow of value towards the centralized hubs of _several_ companies, not just Blockstream. Economic incentives will encourage the majority if not all LN traffic to be routed through well funded and highly connected LN hubs that already have channels open to most endpoints. Bitpay seems a likely candidate for hub operations because of its existing payment infrastructure and relationships with businesses.
Blockstream is a for-profit company, and as they don’t have any apparent existing revenue, and are paying two LN developers… one could reasonably assume they would like to monetize the LN by becoming a hub too, and raking fees. The reason they come up so much in this argument is because they have a dominant role in developing Bitcoin Core, ~50% of code contributions come from Blockstream founders, employees, and contractors. The Bitcoin Core roadmap is nearly verbatim an email Maxwell (Blockstream founder) wrote to the mailing list. To many observers they are using this role to artificially constrain the capacity of the native Bitcoin network in order to incentivize uptake and adoption of an eventually deployed LN.

Vague tweets aren't going to reinforce anything on 1 Aug.

@_date: 2016-09-23 16:19:59
Just to clarify. Old nodes _see_ segwit transactions, they are just unable to verify their signatures. An old node won't generate a segwit address, so if a segwit node sends a transaction to an non-segwit node, segwit can't/won't be used. 
Non-segwit nodes are still kinda compatible with the network, they are just punished economically (a carrot/stick to get them to start using segwit), and a portion of their abilities/benefit as part of the decentralized node network will be quietly eliminated when it comes to the verification of the signatures of certain transactions on the network.

Perhaps my “trolling” has simply advanced to a point that is well above your level of comprehension?
Believe it or not… many think that LN type payment channels _are_ a breakthrough for some applications, and fixing the malleability that ruins it, is worthwhile. However, they are against economic favoritism bestowed by the central planning of a dev clique with a glaring conflict of interest. They may also be against economic changes being soft-forked onto the network, silently limiting the capabilities of full nodes and economically punishing them when they don’t submit to the changes, a dangerous precedent. 
LN shouldn’t be forced to “succeed” via purposefully handicapping the capabilities of the native Bitcoin network, it should/could succeed on its own merits. You can’t engineer a free market or an ideal fee market. When you try… prepare to be humbled. Maybe not tomorrow, but it's just a question of time.

You are all also invested in Blockstream shares, you don't disclose the proportional relationship of each, which is reasonable and expected.

Uh… 


Barrier to _entry_ may be tiny, but being tiny punishes reliability, affordability, and convenience… a huge competitive disadvantage. The barrier to entry for mining Bitcoin is pretty low too… as long as you ignore competitive disadvantages. 


That’s not a “barrier” to growing big, it’s a competitive advantage over your smaller competitors. More capital and more open channels gives your one-hop route additional utility vs the lesser hubs. 
Aside from a thousand or so ideologically motivated (or LE averse) enthusiasts (like those that only send tx over tor, have never reused an address, and religiously mix coins) that might run their own LN nodes and use obfuscated many-hop routes… The incentives involved point to massive hubs, and centralized services offered by them, or centralized services for Joe Public just to interact with LN in general. 
The siphoning of fees from the actual providers of security in Bitcoin, the miners, is just the feather atop this nest of new incentives we’re bolting onto an artificially handicapped native Bitcoin.

Where’s that straw-stuffed sack that advocates for on-chain scaling and is somehow against LN existing (which it obviously already does, in prototype form), and competing? No, the real contention surrounds the fact that LN and kin are being _economically_ _favored_ via the _central_ _planning_ of an economic policy tool… a centrally set (not by miners), static, max block size by an anointed dev group with COI. I missed that part in the white paper.

For an overly simplified explanation...Maybe it would help to think of a lightning channel as a gift card. You deposit BTC into a channel ("time-locked" multi-signature bitcoin address)… this is your gift card balance. LN payments are basically updated versions of the original channel opening transaction with adjusted balances. Each payment... your balance goes down, the merchant's, up. These updates/payments don’t need to be sent to the Bitcoin network unless/until your counterparty is non-compliant or unreachable, or the channel value is exhausted. Downsides are that your LN node will need to constantly be online to watch over your channels (or trust and pay someone else to do this for you), and that it will need access to private keys in order to issue signed updates to the channels (unless you are trusting a third party to provide LN services).

If you would’ve said “this review may last until October of 2016, or later” the signaling to the miners and the economy would have been much more clear. 




You don’t recall, really? BIP 109 is/was intended to be a miner-centric ruleset, at 75% it would be cohesive, and strong. [Unlim], a node operator-centric client, would follow it.


If you can’t see any substantive difference, especially in the changing of _economic_(!) variables, when comparing the changes involved with segwit and CLTV… I can’t help you. 


The market desires more capacity. I have my own opinions on how that should be achieved. Alas, they are not shared with any VC “organizations”, as far as I can tell. 




immutability of the chain
This is the heterogeneity I was talking about. It’s also a slippery slope… there may be a time that your steady hand is not presiding over the authoring of “controversial” soft-forks. 


The *coin crowd has very real reasons to support the limited capacity of Bitcoin. Observable reasons, and results. 




_You’re_ potentially making something into an altcoin, without the permission of the node network… As long as the pool ops say go. What I consider liberty, you consider inconvenience and danger, a baby rent in twain.

It took 6+ years to finally hit 1MB. Miners are the ones who should be determining their own supply curve for block space. Having it determined by a priesthood of developers is called central economic planning, a method that has littered history with failure, _corruption_, and misery.

@_date: 2016-09-02 01:24:07
It says right there:
April 2016 * 0.12.x Segregated witness _deployment_ including “block size increase” 
*Dates with an asterisk are when we expect to release soft fork-ready code… the actual fork will take time to activate…
The roadmap is nearly verbatim, with timeline added, an email you wrote to the mailing list, around the time of the conference in HK. Those who were around at that time will remember that “segwit in april” _was_ used as an argument for going this route vs planning a HF to 2MB, with segwit style fork when ready. You may have not been the one pushing that narrative directly, but I really don’t remember you refuting or tempering it. Just like you didn’t decry the HK agreement when it was announced, that condemnation came much later, at a more politically expedient time. 
I disagree with segwit being a soft-fork in principle. Major changes to the way the protocol operates should be accompanied with a full node referendum. 0.13.0 has 10% of the node share right now, and they could be the only ones verifying witness? These large changes shouldn’t be “green-lighted” by 95% of a handful of individual pool ops, unilaterally leaving disagreeing nodes in a partially blind state without having taken any action. The potential for “opting out” during a HF is a positive, a liberty afforded, not a negative… Soft-fork is the opposite, it is the subversion of that liberty. A node network with heterogeneous capabilities isn’t all that great if they are supposed to represent the decentralized witnesses of the veracity and immutability of the chain.

LN is open source, if it gains any market acceptance at all, there won’t simply be one flavor. There’s nothing stopping someone from just ripping out the artificial complication logic in the routing and offering monolithic hub services. 
Joe Public values convenience, pricing, and reliability much more than privacy, especially for small, repetitive purchases that are likely to use LN. Economic/reliability incentives will strongly favor the hub and spoke model, and will probably lead most usage to route around these artificial complication algos that are just now being tested in artificial environments.
Of course, for obvious PR reasons… I could understand why the idea of “hubs” is to be downplayed. We need to obfuscate the potential hypocrisy at work in the uncompromising “safe decentralized scaling via LN, soon” position.

This idea that a H F can _never_ happen because there’s a chance some group will split off and stick to the old rules is actually damaging to Bitcoin.
The free market would arbitrate where the value lies after a fork. If the fork brings benefit and doesn’t violate the main principles of Bitcoin, it will be successful and the splinter fork will slide off into irrelevance. At least the splinter group was given a choice, the liberty to pursue what they believe Bitcoin to be.
Who cares if Mircea Popescu and his four toadies want to stay on a 1MB4EVA chain, give them the freedom to do that.
This “keeping _everyone_ together at all costs” through coercive and subversive soft forks is a sign of weakness, a demonstration of fear, not of strength.
I’m pretty sure there will be a PoW spinoff launched if/when segwit gets activated by the mining pool ops. Does that occurrence then doom us to perpetual stasis to avoid losing anyone? Of course not.

Economic incentives will encourage the majority if not all LN traffic to be routed through well funded and highly connected LN hubs that already have channels open to most endpoints. It’s not difficult to imagine that most of these major hubs would be run by players that have existing payment infrastructure and relationships with businesses and users.
In this context, we see a few very vocal people want to sacrifice Bitcoin’s native potential utility and capacity to keep maintenance costs low for someone who wants to run a full node in the jungles of Costa Rica… In the name of this jungle node we accept an overlay network where nearly all “Bitcoin” traffic ends up being routed through the LN hubs of BitPay, Blockchain.info, Blockstream, Coinbase, etc. P2P cash becomes P2Hub2P scrip. The very opposite of the decentralization they claim to be protecting. It also siphons tx fees from Bitcoin’s real security providers, the miners. 
We are told that Bitcoin is sick, it’s weak, it can’t handle any more use… and, surprise! Those that are saying this and steering development to artificially incentivize uptake of payment contracts just so happen to be stockholders in companies that are going to be selling you the medicine for your disease! It’d be bad if Bitcoin had a monopoly on cryptographic value transfer, it’s disastrous in the fiercely competitive landscape we will face in the future.

@_date: 2016-09-16 18:17:23


High on-chain fees might be helpful to incentivize uptake of LN in general, yet they are not necessarily a centralizing force _in_ LN. 
The big centralizing forces in LN will be the economies of scale and convenience that benefit highly connected hubs with channels already open to most endpoints and have the depth of liquidity to keep them all open. Firms like Bitpay, with existing infrastructure and connections to businesses and users, come to mind as most likely to form the biggest, cheapest, and most reliable LN transaction routing hubs. 
Unlike native Bitcoin nodes, LN nodes will require private keys to be available for signing and will need to constantly be monitoring channel states on the blockchain in case of attempted theft/fraud. It's easy to see how this will encourage the use of 3rd parties to open and monitor LN channels for users, who may not trust their own connectivity to be monitoring states. 
I agree with your main point that it seems odd to "protect decentralization" by offloading the functional capacity of the network to a layer that seems certain to centralize the flow of value into hubs. These hubs will potentially become gatekeepers and information aggregators. It doesn't make much sense until you consider that there may be some other incentives at play here. 
@_date: 2016-09-29 05:02:00


This assumes there is a problem that needs solving. That additional demand is a "problem". To the contrary, additional demand is what sustains the system... only a fool would abuse it, and take it for granted.

All things in good time friend. It seems to me that most of the talk of PoW changes involves Core rebelling against miners unilaterally hf'ing to greater tx capacity (see Kyle Torpey's recent article sowing the seeds for the idea). 
Miners just waiting (a bit past April) for the production release segwit binaries to arrive before weighing their options sounds like they are playing chess, not checkers. 3 months later, we will see if the HK meeting/agreement was the ruse it appears to be today. In terms of investment, the stakes are higher for miners than almost anyone else in the industry...

Gridlock is a problem on freeways, even if the road isn’t jammed up 24/7.
The mind of an investor is, or _should_ _be_ forward looking. It shouldn’t strain the imagination to understand why some are concerned that BTC is advertising that its peak capacity will be 3.7 tps, maybe 7 at some point in 2017, while competing networks are just now hitting their stride. 
Alt to alt exchange, even discounting eth-etc trading, is up 2-300%, in the last 6 months. 
Some argue and act as though BTC has a monopoly on cryptographic value transfer… that the market will wait _indefinitely_ for Rube Goldbergian overlay IOU networks, and _use_ them (prepaid, always online, keys exposed) even if available. 
It may be a long, painful, and possibly futile process for ms. market to disabuse them of this notion.  
@_date: 2016-09-29 02:02:56


Well, there will always be at least two. One to open the channel, one to close the channel. There can also be balancing, which would be like loading more onto your gift card. But that's the gist... less payments actually being mined into the blockchain. We can trade these blockchain-enforceable IOU's back and forth with each other and only settle them to the blockchain when needed. 
Now, the idea of routing channels tends to be far more complicated. The most efficient and reliable way would be to have massive LN hubs that are reliable, cheap, and highly connected with channels to others. This is undesirable for "decentralized" Bitcoin... so many efforts are underway to hard-code in complication algorithms to attempt to prevent this from happening.

As long as we're selectively quoting... 


Full non-mining nodes can be quite beneficial to the system, but their influence is indirect and derivative, a function of their economic size and power in the market.
This is the crux of the disagreement in the community. 
One side sees the miner's intensely aligned economic incentives to be their most robust and rational protection mechanism. 
The other side derives their protection from an ordained dev team, the beneficiaries of the inertia behind the reliable bitcoin.org and the carefully curated information stream emanating from this sub. The team will carefully adjust the economic constants for them, and through their meritorious technocratic wisdom, wind the dials of production with near perfect precision. Miners are simply a transaction ordering service.
IMO, it is [should be] _functionally_ under the control of the miners. Yet, the miners face consequences for making economic choices _and_ choices which affect the network architecture itself. As long as the risk of forking is more economically dangerous than continued stasis, there is stasis. I think we’ve seen this play out before our eyes the last year or so.

Bitcoin _is_ a “tyranny” of the majority of hashpower. This is intentional, as the miners’ economic interests encourage them to maximize the value of the network they administer and subsequently maximize the reward that it bestows upon them. 


No amount of mental gymnastics and handwaving will change this. This doesn’t leave Joe User without influence or personal liberty. He may always sell his coins. If his ideology is shared with a significant portion of the economy… they may fork away from the mining majority with a PoW change. 


You’ve been bamboozled into thinking you have a benevolent protector, you don’t. At least not in the way you describe it. Your only protection is in the efficiency of markets and the rational self-interest of miners, which are intimately intertwined.

He just (wrongly) explained that a centrally planned production quota is the only limit on the size of blocks that miners will produce. 


This is Soviet style thinking. That, without a centrally planned production quota (limit)... producers (miners) would increase the available amount of a product (block size) until the price (fees for inclusion) reaches zero.
In a capitalist system, producers are capable of deciding their own supply curve for a product. An inelastic supply curve set by an infallible priesthood of technocrats (with a glaring conflict of interest), is about as far from capitalism as you can get. History is littered with the failures born from this kind of central economic planning.

This strategy is only for the most dogmatic partisans, on both sides. I’m more likely to send a big chunk of fiat to the exchange to buy up any panic dumping from those practicing your strategy.
Also, please keep in mind that difficulty adjustment is _much_ less forgiving in Bitcoin. If blocks aren’t getting solved on the 1MB4EVA side, you wouldn’t be able to even receive your 1MB coins before the PoW hard fork made it functional again.

Some are viewing compounding network congestion as a problem... when it is actually the planned and desired outcome.

In a capitalist system, the producer (miner) determines the price (minimum fee) for his product (block space). 
In your system, an infallible priesthood of devs (party leaders) sets a production quota (1MB), and users enter a blind auction for the same perfectly inelastic quantity of the good. 
It is left as an exercise for the reader to determine which approach is more optimal.

The idea that miners can’t be trusted to decide their own block sizes is absurd. That, barring the precise application of an inelastic supply quota by a priesthood of Core devs… miners would bloat the chain to infinity, leading to a handful of datacenter nodes… is silly. 
You’re advocating replacing the primacy of proof of work, with proof of dev “consensus” (something not described in the white paper, I think purposefully). 
Huge blocks _do_ increase orphan risk, a network run in a handful of datacenters _is_ deleterious, miners have intense economic incentives to weigh their production decisions accordingly.

If they actually follow through (which I doubt), watching the UASFers fork off to a rump chain will be one of the best moments in Bitcoin history. It might even teach them a lesson in humility as they come back to the chain that actually has blocks being added to it. 
Perhaps the price can then resume the trajectory it was taking as the NY accord was reached.

Boosted mining is totally compatible with segwit, just more difficult to do covertly. I don't know how long you've been involved with this debate but there is a side that is firmly against a HF _ever_. That is why miners are reluctant to give those devs and that company exactly what they want (segwit only) on a silver platter without assurances that the 1MB limit won't be used to push everyone off to 2nd layer payment hubs. In any event, congrats on your gains, happy dumping.

network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.** A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node. The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices. If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.

Quadratic verification time problems are only encountered at huge transaction sizes, which are trivially disallowed. While it would be nice to make it linear, and this is indeed a selling point for segwit, you're being bamboozled if you think _that_ is why Blockstream is pushing segwit-only like their company's survival depends on it.

In 60 days, the properly configured lite client and thinly deployed full node proletariat will rise! Taking back our birthright from the depraved capitalists!

Being neutral does _not_ imply that exchanges are obligated to list and service every petulant attempt to minority fork the rules of Bitcoin.
Exchanges have already made statements regarding a similarly contentious fork:


That said, I'm sure Polo will have BIP148-coin up and trading against BTC right out the gate.
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:40:56
We're going to definitively find out who's a numpty, in 60 some days, no less. Exciting!
You got your BIP 148 node all set?
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:47:51
Too embarrassed to declare that you're following the BIP 148 chain in ~60 days? I don't blame you. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:43:46
The idea of sitting on our thumbs until mid-2018 to break the impasse elicits laughter from _everyone_ except some Core devs and their toadies. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:16:16
While wasting the bandwidth of nodes on the network to service/relay your old transaction, _and_ your new one... hypocrisy ahoy! It's how we roll. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:06:51
Did you respond to the wrong post? viajero_loco was hilariously under the impression that segwit miners would follow the BIP148 altchain by default. bu-user helpfully and politely corrected him. Now you come in with some unrelated nonsense, weird. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:59:17
How about both?
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:50:44
I doubt it's even 1%, they only managed to get about 3% of Slush's pool after heavy advertising/promotion this week.
It's looking more and more like the only thing happening on 1 Aug is that UASF nodes (real ones, not uacomments) will just cease to function, its promoters' credibility reduced to smoldering ash amidst the echoes of ill-concealed laughter.
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:23:23
So 148 is just a bluff, then.
It only works if you are a significant player and you commit to BIP148. All waffling serves to undermine the threat. 
BTW, by definition, BIP148 doesn't give you the luxury of waiting until 15 Nov, it's 1 Aug, *or bust*.
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:38:21
We're approaching 8 out of 5 thousand PH. I'm cautiously optimistic. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 08:10:27
At least we know your cognitive perception is weak, but extant, nonetheless.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:26:27
Hey look, someone who thinks that mining nodes are wide open and listening to just accept any old connection from joe-attacker.
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:34:16
UASF is a soft fork, it's right there in the name. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:48:31
I'd be surprised if you breach 25 PH. Unfortunately, all but Bitusher 
_don't_ have the balls to commit to 148-coin. A shame, even the biggest pushers are leery of signing on. :( Prepping for failure. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:26:37
That's orthogonal to the point I made. Default values are pretty sticky, wouldn't you say? 
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:36:45
Exploited by an attacker that can connect to their node... not the case with any decently configured mining op. Never let facts get in the way of politics.
@_date: 2017-06-03 08:23:03
pawns are meant to be sacrificed, and don't feel too bad, there's always the consolation of lucrative contracting gigs
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:37:53


And if I had wings, I could fly. 
Come back to me when you cross 50 PH, one hundredth of the hashrate. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:48:50
You're not taking into account the trump card, reorg risk. Just threatening a reorg is liable to make the rules of Bitcoin quite malleable. After all, it's an asymmetric advantage. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:05:08
Let's hope your _several_ petahashes gain the most-work-chain status and result in a fllawless victory for the most worked Samson chain. Gonna be pretty embarrassing, otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:36:20
Current rules of Bitcoin are "invalid" and anyone enforcing them is "malicious", sure thing bud. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:16:28
Do you promise to follow BIP148 as the true Bitcoin? come what may? I'm having trouble getting solid commitment from some other members of the team.
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:54:48
This is called the denial stage. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:47:17
There's a number of ways of isolating your mining node from attackers. Though from where we started, it seems you've completely back-tracked on your lies, good. 


@_date: 2017-06-02 18:47:10
Miners: Blockstream's Chief "Strategy" Officer wants to you switch from signaling Core to BIP148-coin client. 
inb4 he finds out that hashes aren't as easy to spin up as twitter accounts. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:15:08
Nope, there is reorg risk = BIP148 wins... sorry to break it to you. Game theoretics focused Bitcoin experts with man buns have already tweeted as such. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:30:16
I would leave any pool that committed to wasting my hashes on a rump fork without my explicit request, ck seems to understand that.
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:54:08


Could be, perhaps not the end you're thinking of though.
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:02:00


Oh noes! 
I said the same thing you did, just more succinctly. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:04:18
It's going to be an expensive experiment for *someone's parents when they get the electric bill*. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 01:08:13
Of course they're connected to the Bitcoin network, *with specific peers*. You won't find mining nodes on the available crawlers, for instance. You will find their peers, and that is what is getting ddosed, or dos'ed in BU's case. I'm starting to see a lot of people with strong opinions that have no idea how this works.
Just make sure you stick to your principles, and recognize the BIP148 chain as the only valid chain, forever and ever, amen. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:57:10
They know about it, obviously. Forcing the settlement layer useful-idiots/profiteers to stay on the Bitcoin chain to have the argument all over again in the near future is not a feature. 
Thankfully, it looks like they'll be forking off unilaterally quite soon with Luke-Jr as their shepherd.  
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:28:09
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:53:58
Good, how you going to split while 148-coin needs 100 blocks to become spendable?
