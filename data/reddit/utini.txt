Seems I've only sent 1GB, but, I have FiOS and will let this fucker run until it burns out.  Eventually I'd like to go with a Pi or something else specifically built for running a full node.  Maybe I'm an idiot but, with the number of people running full nodes out there being as low as it is, I felt like, I could do a little bit of a small sad violin for the big band kind of thing...

My first attempt was with OSX; it wast too old of a machine for the current build; too slammed down to run a full node as is, so, I just erased the hell out of it all and put ubuntu on it..  I learned to use ubuntu hijacking office computers so I could make animated gifs and other silly shit thTat was strangely satisfying at the time.
I'm working with an old Macbook Pro. Once the iPhone SE is fully paid off, i'm just going to get a burner android and maybe a mickey mouse land line. I'm hoping to just have a nest egg and let the rest of the world fuck off. Wish me luck.

Seems more people can easily run a full node with a spare machine, so, I set up my laptop that’s barely been used for anything in the past couple years to help.
