No problem. Basically when a hardfork happens it takes a "snapshot" of the blockchain and that "snapshot" becomes the new forked coins blockchain. Anything you do post-fork on the old chain doesn't affect the new chain. So using the BCH hard fork as an example, you had 100 BTC at the time of fork. At time of fork + 1 day, you spent 50 BTC. You then decide to load up electrum and redeem your BCH, you would have 100 BCH. So now you have 50 BTC and 100 BCH 1 day after the fork.

After all 21M BTC are mined, miners are incentivized to work by confirming transactions and receiving transaction fees as a result.

You can withdraw BCH from breadwallet. It's an option if you go to Menu&gt;Settings&gt;advanced. Just need to set up a BCH electrum wallet on your PC or something and input the destination address in breadwallet. You'll get your BCH you had at the time of fork.

Cloud mining is a scam. You end up spending a huge upfront amount of cash and in order to break even you have to have the mining contract for a year or longer. Even after that the cloud mining companies take 60-70% of your profits so you only make pennies a day.

You would simply need to import your 12 word phrase into the new forked coin's wallet.

Small fish with weak hands.
People saw the rally earlier this week, hopped on the train but got scared.

Your fee is a bit low, optimal fee is around 350 sat/byte currently.

You don't need "a" Bitcoin, you can buy any one hundred millionth of a fraction of a Bitcoin. For example, 0.001 BTC which is roughly equal to 9.95 USD.
Remember not to buy more than you can afford to lose.

That's really it.
