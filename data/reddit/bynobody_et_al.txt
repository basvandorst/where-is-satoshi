As someone who understands these laws, I would appreciate it if they would humour me and tell me what the fuck is going on.

I'm with you there. It feels like we are being robbed. Like some asshole over there can't take the time out of their day and at least tell those of us that have thousands at stake what the fuck is going on. It has made me not want to invest in BTC even though I want to use it and think it could really take off and be revolutionary. The scary thing is that, on a relative scale, Bitfloor's closing has flown under the radar on reddit for what it really is. From what I understand, Bitfloor was doing 4% of the work in the exchange world for the ENTIRE currency. Then it just shuts down and doesn't tell anyone with money involved what is going on and there are like 200 people that seem concerned in the least bit on r/bitcoin.

Mine uploaded fine but that was last night. Now I'm into the verification process so who knows... I am not pleased that some users received warning emails about this while others didn't. Completely unprofessional on the part of Bitfloor. Now those of us that were prevented from acting earlier now have to put our trust in the ethics of a company that we have not had time to build a relationship with. I understand completely the speculative nature of Bitcoin trading and its volatile nature but this loss would have nothing to do with that. If lose money in Bitcoin, I want it to be because of my own ineptitude, not because I was robbed.

"The check is in the mail."
My stomach sunk when I saw this. This is shit that delinquent renters tell landlords when they are scrambling around trying to buy time. This is from a business that, not more than 3 days ago, was actively moving money via wire transfers and completing multiple ACH withdrawals for clients. Are they communicating with the bank through a telegram or smoke signals as well? I call bullshit and I think we are about to get burned here.

I think I'll go make a drink...

Use this thread to come back to if you can't withdraw your funds. There are alot of people in the boat you are in. I am one of these people and in for even more than you. Hopefully, between all of us, we can insure this gets sorted out.

You could very well be correct.

The market hasn't had time to create a sufficient interface. Market. Market, market, market.

Yes. "They" being the banks. Sorry, I view the government and the banks as the same entity in this the US.

Failed miserably. I still haven't gotten an email from them and I have USD in there. Alot. I had to find out about this on reddit and now I am just going to have to be patient for the next couple of days and hope that some website with only a "Roman" with no last name will not rob me blind. Awesome.
