Or that's what they want you to believe, and they will buy your coins from you at bottom barrel prices. Careful about jumping to conclusions; even if everyone and their mum want to withdraw their coins from there, they will still have all your coins because it's not fractional reserve and they don't leverage your coins 1:30 like every major bank in existence. Basically unless their cold storage has been hacked or stolen somehow or barring some enormous clusterfuck that they're not telling us about, your coins should be there. Whether or not you'll be able to get them out soon is another matter.

Only a government (or government financial complex) can hope to get away with this.
You think governments aren't capable of this? The British government turned England into the most prosperous place on earth by ["selling" (at gunpoint) opium to China]( (and when China wanted it stopped, England started a war for the "right to sell opium" which they won). The US government very recently financed paramilitary armies with cocaine smuggled into and sold on the US market, in order to "combat" the (non-existent) "threat" of Sandinistas in Nicaragua (who were harmless leftists, made out to be a *nuclear threat* on US television using clever scare-mongering graphics such as the infamous map with little dots symbolising an impending nuclear missile strike on the US). Their favoured banks (JP Morgan, HSBC etc.) recently got caught laundering billions upon billions of dollars for Mexican drug cartels (the punishment was a small fine, not even 1% of the profits). They got caught fixing interest rates on a global scale. And all of this is just in recent years and decades. Colonialism. Slavery. They're criminals, the type of criminals who get away with virtually anything so long as their "perception management" is skilled enough. Anyone remember COINTELPRO? JTRIG? ECHELON? Prism? You should at least be able to remember three of those if you read the papers.
Either this is a thief or hacker(s) who got in way over their head, inside job or no, or it's a group of people who fully expect to **get away with this**. What interests me is who would expect to get away with this?

It is not, because that is presuming any solution can only be compared with "nothing". It's an easy way to make an argument, but the resulting argument is false. I'm not even saying it's the worst idea, just that comparing something to "nothing" is nonsense. 
That said, using an altcoin seems not only far-fetched but opens us up to all new sorts of problems. For example, there are already large amounts of Mastercoins out there which could be used to attack Gox depositors and rob them AGAIN. So quite how that could work I can't even imagine; mastercoin is completely unproven as protocol, unaudited and has far too many unknowns. And until someone can prove to me beyond doubt A) it's not a trick to scam Gox depositors out of their BTC and B) It would work, I can only applaud the effort and (hopefully good) motive but will never agree to any such scheme.

I don't know why you got downvoted, but this is sound advice. Coming from someone who probably lost (most of) ~1.8 BTC to Gox. I didn't even keep it there, but had bought a quantity with fiat that finally arrived from weeks earlier. Bad luck and timing. But it's still sound advice.

What if investors are trying to seize Gox depositors' coins on the cheap (understatement) by claims of fiat liabilities? They have no grounds to do so but they can essentially make it up if they're skilled lawsuit trolls (Coinlab? Who else do we know about?). That could screw over every Gox depositor. Who is walking away with 800k BTC if not stolen? Well that counts as stolen in my book, but you know.
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:02:02
Come on, think. If Gox were actually ONLINE and people could actually LOGIN and TRADE they would immediately scoop up those cheap bitcoins, instantaneously driving up the price. Which hasn't happened, since Friday. Alternatively, people would try to get their funds the hell out of mtgox asap. Which hasn't happened, since Friday. Ergo? Zero trades, zero movement, dead exchange. People will be lucky to get their funds out at this point.
Instead, Gox is "down for maintenance" (roughly 36 hours behind schedule) and they are just trolling people with fake numbers on the frontpage. Why else do you think the price (lol) is fluctuating around 250$?
Do me a favour, go to mtgox.com, and read what it says here:

Stop spreading FUD, this is just a classic MtGox clusterfuck which will be sorted out once the cappuccino machines are unclogged or once they've reached lvl100 in WoW (whichever happens sooner). That doesn't alleviate the fact people can't login and access their funds, though, people have a right to be pissed off they can't access MtGox when they most want to.
I'm not so sure MtGox closing would be bad news, however, seems like any time you actually want to use them, they're offline or "down for maintenance".

I don't fear monger, I'm just saying if your algos are dumb and you come near this exchange within a 200 mile radius you will lose everything. I make no claim of having any idea what will happen on this exchange (it's a contest between black boxes so no one *can* know) except generally smart algos will best dumb algos; how it will affect prices outside of this exchange is anyone's guess, but as with anything HFT expect volatility, flash crashes, and events that border on the inexplicable, because they happen for reasons unknown (as the algos are best kept secrets) and on time-scales that completely dwarf human comprehension. For example, here is [10 milliseconds of trading in Merck, slowed down by a factor of 40000]( I nowhere mentioned a ban on HFT exchanges, but that doesn't mean I have to like it, and it certainly doesn't mean I can't warn people against being eaten alive by an algorithm that's worth more than the GDP of a small country.

I don't really see myself as libertarian, more left leaning, and for me the two are not mutually exclusive though sadly this is anathema to many libertarians and they stopped reading at the word "left". BUT I essentially consider all mainstream politics in most "liberal democracies" to be for all intents and purposes dead in the water with almost no hope of ever improving by itself; case in point being the most ["sophisticated"]( intelligence agency in the "free world" being employed to sabotage every climate change conference ever held - that was, for me, amongst many other, more blood-soaked things, a point from which no return is possible. Nothing now will *ever* erase the fact that, not only are we ruled by sociopathic oligarchs, kleptocrats, idiots and war-loving killers, we are as a species, as a planet even, being purposely sabotaged in our immediate survival, for the financial benefit of a small (and very short-sighted) financial establishment.
Anyway.. I think the fear is, among many Bitcoiners, that when it comes to Bitcoin specifically, that governments, being bastions of conservatism, vested interests, and not to mention hopeless Luddites, will only be able to come up with heavy-handed regulations that would hamper bitcoin and related businesses in favour of the status quo. This is not an unreasonable fear. However regulation has, so far, not been able to kill the internet, for example (though not for lack of trying). So apparently there might be a possible middle-ground, where Bitcoin (like the internet) is resilient enough to withstand stupid ideas such as political censorship while perhaps benefiting from some regulation (such as net neutrality).
Given the reality, however, that current financial systems and businesses such as banks, hedge funds, HFT etc. operate not only outside of the law but above it, it would be supremely ironic if, before there even exists regulations to prevent another 2008-like crisis (which is to say an entirely manufactured and highly profitable crisis), and before even a single banker has been investigated and sentenced to jail for fraud and theft, Bitcoin regulation would somehow become a number one priority.
On the other hand, I would much prefer it if people who know about Bitcoin and understand it, would come up with good ideas before people who don't know anything about it come up with bad ideas. There is such a thing as beneficial (even necessary) regulation, BUT given that it doesn't seem to have been invented and implemented yet with regard to financial systems and anti-corruption, and in fact currently only serves the corrupt interests of the most powerful financial "institutions" that are able to buy and shape the laws that benefit them, and kill the laws that don't, perhaps people would be more open to the idea if that situation provably changes for the better.
So as for your question, there is no difference, it's just a nuance which has subtly different connotations and applications. I think you'll find people are generally in favour of good regulations and laws and against bad regulations and laws though opinions may be divided on how these look like. You'll also find not many people want to invite the scum-bags and killers of the world to launder their blood money using our magical internet money, and certainly not purposely make it easier for them.

Except that all or most of those exchanges turned out to be thieves who ran with the money or were robbed (or pretended as much). If that were the case here why are they working with Japanese authorities to.. I hesitate to say resolve.. the situation, whatever said situation might be. Bank run, theft, ransom, data loss, malleability, incompetence etc. or any combination of these are possible, and I desperately don't want to fool myself, but I also need more to go on than "there's a situation we are trying to resolve - yours truly MtGox team". I hope you can understand.
That much money doesn't just go missing without people asking questions (it's still in the blockchain). If people want to berate, blame and laugh at us that's their right. If Gox does close down and everyone loses everything, I hope the community might launch an effort to at least find out what happened to all those coins. Bitcoins can be tracked, such that thieves would always have to keep tumbling and forwarding their coins and use proxies in order to avoid capture. So there's that, but other than unverifiable information (which could easily be A) forged and B) of profit to speculators, insider traders etc.) we know basically next to nothing other than the suspension of services and the few non-statements posted on their site.

This is something mining pools have been doing for quite a while. It's a great precaution, but as a precaution it only works assuming an exchange or service has solid security measures in place besides that, and that the user knows what they're doing. It only prevents hackers from getting a user's coins in the case they manage to acquire the user's login/password, it doesn't help if the server itself is hacked though.

Well actually banks do this stuff all the time (stopping withdrawals or even access) and they never have all the money that their customers deposit with them (as they leverage it heavily) but no one bats an eyelid. I guess with hindsight there's no good reason MtGox would behave better than a bank, I just didn't expect them to behave as bad or worse. *If* the rumours of theft or fractional reserve are true. 
As much as I appreciate the advice to accept and move on, I think it's time first to find out what happened. Don't worry about me not being able to come to grips with it, not only does my possible loss pale in comparison to that of others, I will survive and still have my health and a roof over my head.

If this ship is sinking someone made pretty damn sure no one could get to the lifeboats or even get life-jackets. I had the bad luck or wanting to make a trade there at the worst possible time, but my reasoning as far as MtGox was concerned was that they were, if nothing else, one of the most experienced exchanges (as in, probably knew how to deal with all the stuff they've been through). Coupled with how secure the bitcoin protocol can be, I was reasonably sure my funds wouldn't be any less secure there than they were in my wallet. Of course, I was probably wrong, but this is to help make you understand how a lot of people didn't see this coming at all.
Of course, what's even worse is that I have serious trouble believing there has been a theft of all or even most of their funds. It just beggars belief. In every sense imaginable.

Wait, what? There are people who can login to MtGox? Haha, no.
Sorry but I find that hard to believe. It's easy using Cloudflare or whatever to keep a frontpage up, but I doubt anyone's been able to login all weekend (special friends of MtGox excepted of course).
You guise do know mtgox has a long history of trolling, right? Pretending you can buy a 240$ bitcoin at Gox fits that pattern perfectly (while simultaneously attracting wide-eyed noobs who think they can actually login and buy, any guesses as to how many new potential customers this little stunt is getting them?).
No, if anyone's buying bitcoin for that price, it's MtGox. I think at this stage they've convinced themselves they are actually real-life alchemists.

I honestly don't know what it is about bitcoin they don't want to or can't understand, but the banksters will never embrace bitcoin because it makes their mafia practices that much harder to conceal, doubly so when it gains any form of widespread adoption.
Why do you think both Russian and Chinese governments banned bitcoin first? Because a lot of ultra-corrupt mafia politicians, banksters and clergy stand to lose their iron grip on, well, everything. Name ANYTHING and they own it. Not just the oligarchs either; there's a whole new generation of corrupt politicians, quangos and their envelope middlemen that seek to steal anything and everything, preferably tax-payer money (because that way the government does the collecting) but anything is fair game. Bitcoin threatens this arrangement.

Instantaneous transfer of value between any two people anywhere on planet Earth. Simple as that. Exactly what that means and will mean is where opinions will vary, but I wouldn't be surprised if in five or so years you will think nothing of it to order your favourite coffee from across the world directly using this infrastructure, no ideology needed. If you take a moment to think how even such a simple scenario would change the world, it gets interesting. Because while perhaps you might never have given it a moment's thought where your coffee or chocolate comes from, it can literally be the difference between starvation and prosperity for the person who farmed that coffee or collected those chocolate beans (usually child labourers with machetes who are deprived of education or even freedom). That's not ideology, that's the real world we live in. Some few million badly paid poor souls from the Chinese countryside with dreams of making it in the big city are working as we speak [ruthless hours and days for practically no pay to make your iPhone]( while maybe a hundred people across the ocean pocket the wealth (spent, in turn, almost exclusively on luxury properties and luxury items). A few million people and their dreams crushed in exchange for lots of dollar bills. Multiply this case a million-fold (substituing Apple, or coffee or chocolate with virtually anything that can be bought with money) and you've maybe got a chance at grasping what this capitalism does. Call it whatever you will, but ideas can change the world.

A good daily newspaper is about as far removed from "thousands of other sites" as one can get. Yes there are a lot of great newspapers available (mostly) for free online, but it's not like the experience is totally equivalent. 
And a lot of the great papers that offer most of their content for free are losing money on it, while shitty websites like HuffingtonPost^1, which are riddled with corporate (and government) propaganda pieces written by hacks and lobbyists are swimming in money, profiting not just from 'corruption' but from aggregating content that's mostly not even theirs.
Traditional newspapers have their faults, but I cringe every time I see someone almost gleefully declaring newspapers dead, like that's going to make journalism better. It might, some day. So far we've mostly gotten parasites like HuffPo and a whole crapload of bad journalism, "embedded journalism", puff pieces and outright shameless advert-articles and propaganda. Not to mention that as we rely less and less on newspapers, people rely more and more on 24-hour news channels (or their websites/videos) which often barely go in-depth, if at all. And reading papers on throwaway tablets (in that lots of people get a new one every year) isn't actually an improvement over print newspapers as far as people and the environment is concerned, either.

Definition**s**, plural. And just because the latency definition isn't in there doesn't mean it wasn't used like that by thousands of people, making it just as valid as any on the UB lemma. At one time it certainly meant that people suffered high latency in getting trade information, orders and prices (anywhere between seconds to minutes to an hour), because at the time Gox was "falling victim to its own success" ie couldn't handle the massive surge in interest/users.

You're overlooking how the very devaluation is used to maintain a status quo where being rich by itself produces a lot more money, plenty more in fact than corrected for inflation. Whereas being poor tends to devalue people themselves (or at least work to that effect) as well as prohibiting them from climbing out of poverty, not having access to better education, and would be lucky to even manage to keep up with inflation.
In other words: Under the current systems, the rich benefit massively from having the poor in debt. Since the 1980s alone, the rich have tripled their wealth and income while the rest have become poorer.

What is it with these hundreds of "go spend bitcoins nao!" comments? Don't you think people are smart enough to figure how and on what they spend their bitcoin? Do you honestly feel that telling them bitcoins are a currency (ie that you can spend) over and over again makes any difference?
For example, a lot of people are still saving up until they have .1 or half a bitcoin, and there is *nothing wrong with saving*. Contrary to what George Bush Jr. kept telling everyone every speech he made, it is NOT anyone's "duty" to spend. Bitcoin doesn't work that way. Yes adoption is great, but please stop telling people to spend; it's a currency, people know what to do with it, and when they should save and spend. You're *really* not telling them anything they don't know.
Comments like these just remind me of horrible political leaders who think they will fix the economy by telling anyone and everyone to *spend spend spend* whilst not considering how that actually impacts people rather than some really small short-term benefit for "the economy". The thing is bitcoin doesn't need fixing in this regard; it's useful as both store of value and medium of exchange (currency). Leave the rest up to users.

I can't understand why you think this is brilliant, perhaps you should send them a thank you note as well. Re:
1) The only "channel" this provides is an intermediary who introduces more points-of-failure - in fact it's what their clients are paying them for (as well as advertising themselves as clowns on CNBC). I don't think the word infrastructure means what you think it does. Rich people getting richer with bitcoin, whilst not even wanting to understand it, is something I consider a bad thing (let's put this down to a matter of perspective or philosophy). Bitcoin is a medium of exchange and a store of value, not a get rich(er) quick scheme. I see absolutely no reason to cheer every time another investment fund or hedge fund or whatever decides to move into bitcoin. These are the same people who recklessly short the global economy and make hundreds of millions lose their jobs if it means they can make a few cents, and you want me to feel kumbaya about them buying bitcoin? Not going to happen.
2) No I haven't. It can't be harder than buying them at any of the reliable exchanges. Unless you're (say) laundering money.
3) Yes. Well, not with a lot of money. I take it you mean people over 50 with a lot of money are too stupid to understand the concept of cold storage. So essentially you're advocating a fund where people buy, through an intermediary, something they do not themselves understand. Great idea, what could possibly go wrong?
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:36:00
No, correct me if I'm wrong but "irrational exuberance" is when almost no one is expecting a crash. Everyone who's been into bitcoin for some time knows crashes happen, driven by supply and demand, psychology as well as co-ordinated speculation. The thing is every time it crashes, it's higher than the previous crash, or quickly recovers as people scoop up cheap bitcoins from panic sellers. Your words of caution will not change this.
But it is good to point this out (every single day on this subreddit, in fact) though pretty much everyone with bitcoin knows crashes happen (and if they don't they will soon experience it firsthand, but it's good to warn them not to panic sell). And for something which supposedly had its "bubble popped", not just in April but around pretty much every price point (!) for the past four years (!) it sure has a good way of assembling itself again afterwards.
I think the vast majority here expect steady "growth" as adoption scales up the network, but no amount of warnings will stop speculation and demand for bitcoins. Worries that the bitcoin network can't handle this are unfounded however.

"Data leads a life of its own quite independent of datum, of which it was originally the plural. It occurs in two constructions: as a plural noun (like earnings), taking a plural verb and plural modifiers (as these, many, a few) but not cardinal numbers, and serving as a referent for plural pronouns (as they, them); and as an abstract mass noun (like information), taking a singular verb and singular modifiers (as this, much, little), and being referred to by a singular pronoun (it). Both constructions are standard. The plural construction is more common in print, evidently because the house style of several publishers mandates it."

Actually that's not true despite Bitcoin being the most robust method, check the donation page on wikileaks.
And you forgot to add "..in the United States." because to my knowledge that's the only country blocking donations to Wikileaks, even trying to extend the blockade internationally through VISA and pals (the reason I cancelled my creditcard and avoid using paypal if possible).
Where I live in Europe I can just donate with online banking (when it's not getting DDOSed) or even more conveniently pay with the most widely used online payment system here. Although Bitcoin is even more convenient because there's no need for 2FA of course, as there's no middleman.

You replied to someone who asked if greed was an inherent trait or a learned one by recommending to read The Selfish Gene, a book which aims to explain how genes 'strategise' in organisms to increase their frequency in the population. Dawkins in this book has nothing to say on the subject of greed.
Therefore I conclude you were implying that greed is a genetic trait and you think somehow that this claim is backed up by Dawkins in The Selfish Gene. It is not, but that doesn't stop proponents of game theory making this mistake again and again and worse trying to convince others of their misunderstanding. Said proponents are usually economists.

*Why* would you expect your BTC in the bank to gain interest? You don't have to guard against inflation. Think about it.
For a bitcoin bank, I would expect to pay a small once off fee, to guarantee security and to guarantee/insure my deposit can be recovered should their security somehow fail and my coins got stolen. What I emphatically *do not* want is to deposit my BTC in a bank that will subsequently start gambling it away on the markets in return for interest. For example, the stock markets have suffered *two* major declines of more than 50% in just the last 10 years; so to get your few percent of interest every year, the banks are risking half our money!
This is why in the case of bitcoin, you can expect to see a shift from the current unsustainable mentality of money making money, to one where the mechanisms which force people to let the banks gamble away their money have ceased to exist. Simply put you don't need interest, because you don't need to correct for the inflation of fiat currency, which in reality just facilitates the ever increasing concentration of wealth in the corporate financial elite, which is why it's possible today that [0.1401% of people own 84% of all wealth globally]( and pay no taxes on it.

What regulation?
Thatcher, Reagan, Maior, Clinton, Blair, Bush etc. did away with all that, remember?
To call the current mechanisms 'safeguarding' against criminal behaviour regulation would be farcical. It's not that regulation is bad or ineffective, it's that there's not been any for decades. Though obviously ineffective regulation is bad; that doesn't mean regulation by definition can't be done properly, we just forgot how. Our leaders made us forget. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that what little there is, is all set up to be gamed by the largest 'financial institutions' to concentrate wealth and power further.

Also I don't own any of the things you mention and my mobile is a years-old gift, made by Huawei which Foxconn had nothing to do with, and I will keep using it until it dies, instead of buying a new one every 6 months/year/2 years, or just ditch it altogether since I barely use it for anything other than calling; all the games on smartphones are crap anyway.

You don't have to be particularly good with computers, just buy a few USB flash drives or memory cards to back up your wallet periodically, so long as you know how to encrypt your wallet using Bitcoin-Qt's built-in method (Settings &gt; Encrypt Wallet) and know how to create and remember a (strong!) password or otherwise keep it safe, you're better off with a personal wallet. Backing it up is as easy as copying your wallet.dat file to a flash drive.
Contrary to popular belief you can actually write down your wallet password on a piece of paper so long as you keep it safe, or at least until you've got it memorized. The same goes for the USB flash drives.
Additionally you should strive to, when you've got a few BTC, create a second more secure offline wallet (a personal wallet on a computer not connected to the internet). Then you'd have a completely secure wallet, from which you transfer smaller amounts of bitcoins that you're going to spend into your 'small personal wallet' which you keep on a computer connected to the internet. Because your offline wallet can't be accessed from the internet, only your personal wallet could ever theoretically be compromised, which is why you only deposit bitcoins into there when you're going to spend them.
Then you could start looking into additional encryption methods, which are as easy as downloading 7zip or WinRAR and creating a secure archive (basically just a password-protected .zip or .rar file).
Other clients like Armory and Electrum also make it easier to manage all your wallets and automate the process of managing your offline wallet and your connected personal wallet.
All of these methods are more secure than online wallets. See:

For the price of a Maserati, you could instead have:
1. A real car (make of that what you will, for me it's a good efficient car which is fun to drive so basically most small hatchbacks) as opposed to a status symbol which *loses half its value on the day of purchase* (also don't be surprised if you'll spend another half on running costs over a few years). Expensive cars tend to be money sink-holes. Better yet you should evaluate whether you even need a car at all, or want one for that matter (if you live in a big city the answer is probably no).
2. Enough bicycles to last you forever. For small distances just take the bike, which pretty much saves you the time of going to the gym daily (unless cycling to the gym of course). Also more fun to drive unless you live somewhere really cycling-unfriendly. The view is always better.
3. Approx. 90BTC left at current prices.
4. The knowledge that life on earth might just have a future, if fewer people aspired to own luxury sports cars as soon as they earned a little money. Think of it as an investment in something greater than yourself, from which everyone you ever knew and cared about will benefit.

Install Bitcoin-Qt, it will create a wallet which you can password protect (use a strong password) and then simply back up the wallet.dat file.
You can also use Electrum which will create a deterministic wallet (meaning that it is created from a series of 12 random words, which if you write them down and memorise them, can even recreate your wallet after total data loss). It works roughly the same as the default client, but like Armory it has a few more features. More importantly you don't have to download the entire blockchain (this is the public ledger of all transactions ever).
I would recommend starting with Electrum or Bitcoin-Qt to get used to it, then use or change whatever client you want.
Don't use online wallet services except for small amounts.

For example, I could say, right here, that I think it was commissioned by George Soros to provide a safe haven from depreciating commodities and fiat as well as a convenient means to fund global people-power movements. But I'd be lying to illustrate a point.
I think the mere fact Graham could imagine an economist somewhere coming up with and having programmers cook up a cryptocurrency betrays his severely outdated world-view. I suppose it must be hard for some people to imagine that information technology allows people to come up with solutions previously only thought the domain of government and big business.

That segue joke doesn't even make any sense; "Speaking of trading in dodgy non-existent commodities" really? So strictly speaking when I pop to the grocer's to buy food I'm actually paying with dodgy non-existent commodities? I guess that's one way of putting it.
Shame the beeb has opted to be BoE's mouthpiece, there used to be a time when they were by and large for the people not the establishment.

lol who cares what some far right bankster rag thinks? They wouldn't know tech if it was embedded in their brains. This is the rag which always picks the sociopath exploiters (Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg) over the real genius innovators and heroes.

Ah right, I stand corrected.

Either he's having a little fun at the Libor/ISDAfix scandal.. he can't be serious. Although to call it a scandal would suggest it's outside of the norm, whereas scamming *is* the norm in the financial sector.

Letting what "some people think" decide should be or should not be words is how we ended up with "Freedom Fries" and "Freedom Toast".
People are smarter than you give them credit for; imo the sooner people come in contact with the term crypotocurrency the better they will understand it. Skipping a term by calling it math-based makes little sense to anyone; bitcoin is the solution to a mathematical problem called the "double spend", but it does so with cryptography. 
"Math-based currency" also sounds, to my ears, at least intuitively, like a less concise term than "cryptocurrency". And I love maths.

Nerds can't understand why Apple is a 400 billion dollar company? Let's see: they're [the most ruthless exploiter of electronic sweatshop labor]( and accept nothing less than 80% margins, they pride themselves on cultivating a culture of permanent fear in every part of its criminal enterprise, from the electronic sweatshop all the way up to development (an [Apple employee who accidentally lost some prototype kit got severely beaten by Apple, before killing himself]( but that's cults for you, and I don't have to remind you of the hundreds of people killing themselves in Apple's electronic sweatshops). They brilliantly manipulate and cheat their customers without any shame, [using symbols and allusions of religion, sex and gossip/rumour to sex up their worthless products]( turning their stores into virtual cathedrals for worshipping status symbols. Not to mention nerds are actively involved in every part of this process, from the design of the atrociously candied UIs to cheating customers out of their warranties.
So, do you even stop to think before you write such nonsense, or do these things just sound too awesome in your head that they don't require something so mundane as forethought?

Where do you get your charts? Bitcoin didn't hit 200 until April this year, so I'm guessing you're looking at something someone drew in MS Paint.

No, for the proper context for non-scientists it's better to recommend Adam Curtis' [The Trap: What Happened to Our Dream of Freedom]( and [All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace]( The last one you can find on vimeo although their search is crap, and of course torrent.
Humans are very complex in myriad ways, only looking at things on the gene level will never get you a full picture. Furthermore Game Theory utterly fails at being applied to human behaviour, because it assumes humans are robots which are always seeking to betray others to profit. It's a pseudo-scientific view of the world that started living a life of its own in the "economic sciences", without ever actually having an iota of evidence to back it up.

That point keeps being repeated over and over again but since it's not stopping people from spending their bitcoins now I don't see how that would change going forward. The only thing a store needs is a working internet connection to work off the latest prices, or just have the whole thing automated using bitpay/bitspend.
Online stores usually have internets.
