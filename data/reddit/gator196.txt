That's probably the most flaccid inducing apology cop out I've ever seen. Seems like he was lying and he knew that he couldn't get away with it

Or you could just be a nice person and explain what happened. The problem with this subreddit is that people get all snobby over nothing. Let's all try being decent fucking people. If I was a new comer to bitcoin and somebody gave me this response..I'd be like fuck this place. Who cares that you red a fucking gossip and he didn't, you should share.

I liked to use that app to buy and sell small amounts with my roommates. It was great for things like splitting groceries or paying one of them for my portion of the electricity bill. The simple and clean format was an effective way to get people involved with the community. Circle has helped me get dozens of people to start using bitcoin.
When I started a bitcoin club on my campus they worked with us to give every student who used the app $5. I thought it was a great company.
I know I may be coming off as a Reagan Era bitcoiner here but I just wanna make Circle great again):

The guy was excited about paying with Btc. So what do we do? Bash his post with negative comments. Common now, we look like a bunch of fools to other subreddits. The price is going up, this means more people are going to be on this subreddit, so get your shit together people
