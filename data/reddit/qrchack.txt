Wonder if I can get a slice in Poland, gotta check it out. Bitcoin pizzas sound awesome, how do they taste like? :D

Basically, yes. Hash functions are always bound to have collisions, because they use fixed length. For example, from any given file you get a 16-character checksum. Of course, there is unlimited amount of data you can calculate a checksum on, so there is a possibility that you can craft some other data that gives you the exact same checksum. Hash algorithms take current processing power into account in order to make it impractical (read: either you need several million$ worth of a supercomputer or you'd have to wait like 20 000 years). But as we all know, processing power keeps getting cheaper and cheaper all the time. That's why SHA1 is considered insecure since about 2011 and not recommended. Yet still it's widely used.
With this method, you can forge a fake file (change the terms of an insurance policy, replace program installers with malware, you name it) and make it have the same checksum as the legit file. This is *really* dangerous, as SHA sums are also used in various open-source programs (to check if your ISP/country is cheating on you and injecting viruses into software you download), including disk encryption software (where having the legit software with no NSA backdoors is a must).
So, yeah, you will need to swap algorithms from time to time to keep up with the improvements of hardware.
**Edit:** this also applies to https website certificates, you could make another certificate for a fake bank website and make the browser think it's a legit one (because the checksum is okay). You'd get the lock icon in your browser, but the website could be anything. Because the first collision was found by Google (at least they believe so, and hey, they have quite a bit of processing power to be sure they're the first - if anybody else did it, we'd probably know about it as it's a pretty big deal for security), they've already patched their products (Google Drive etc.). Chrome is also updated and will not accept tampered certificates, Firefox has the fix coming in "early 2017", whatever that's supposed to mean.

SHA1 is supposed to be a unique checksum to make sure the data you got is exactly what was sent to you. So you would give the recipient the checksum and then the data. Then, on the other end, you calculate the checksum and see if it matches what was given to you. SHA1 is a so-called "hash" function, which means it's got to be unique and not reversible (you can't get the data from the checksum). This fact is used in cryptography (e.g. to check if the password is correct).
Now the deal is they've found two different pieces of data that give the same checksum. This is called a collision. Basically, say you have an account somewhere and your password is "password123" (kids, don't do that). Now, say the checksum of that is 30911. If you manage to find another text that gives you a checksum of 30911, you'll log in no problem even though you didn't use the correct password. This is a **big** deal - as said, it's being used in various places for security, but now the security has been compromised.
*Disclaimer: I know, this is a very simple, at times one could say misleading, description, but I just wanted to ELI5*

Well, you don't know what the checksum is until you try and calculate it. So you don't know what sort of "junk" will fit in, and the odds of finding a collision randomly are pretty much non-existent. So you need to try tons of random junk until you find something that works. That's why it took Google so much time and money, even though they exploited the way SHA1 works and got the results 100.000x faster than just brute forcing every single option.
The thing is, once you have one collision, it works only for the data you tried it with. For other data you need another junk to add. Which would be another years of waiting for the thing to calculate by trying random stuff. Say, "abc" + "some junk" gives a checksum of 123, now "abcd" needs something different than "some junk" to get the same checksum, so you basically try millions of random pieces of junk until something fits in.

Because having a fixed block size is wrong by design and you'd have to break all the software again in 5 years or so

There's a schism going on at the moment, purists (Bitcoin Core) say the block size ("datafile with transactions") should be kept locked at 1MB max, while Bitcoin Unlimited guys say we should change the whole protocol to allow unlimited block size. If they split up, they aren't compatible with each other, so essentially we'd have two different cryptocurrencies. Needless to say, everyone got scared and prices went down as people started selling their coins.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:20:37
Basically, the two versions of software won't accept each other, and as some people keep using Core and some switch to Unlimited, we have two separate networks - therefore, two separate currencies.

TL;DR in China they said BTC isn't money so companies jumped on the bandwagon of tax evading. Give them a week or so and they'll catch up. If they start regulating Bitcoin, we'll be all in shit and prices will fall. Or they won't. You never know with Bitcoin.

It's called [Coinbase](

Humble Bundle uses Coinbase and it's pretty good. For Coinbase users it's one-click, for others it generates an address to send Bitcoin to. One issue I had with it - it sets like 10 minutes time limit after which your transaction is considered cancelled if the money doesn't come. For some reason after I sent my Bitcoins it took a few hours to come. Contacted support, they checked the issue, confirmed and all went fine.

It is. Go with Stripe, Humble Bundle used it back in the way and it just worked.

Got started with Coinbase and a shitton of faucets. Earned a few bucks, spent them on Humble Bundle. It was like a day or two of captchas for a couple of games, really :D Later created Xapo account as well, as some faucets give bonus if you withdraw to Xapo. Now I'm using pretty much both.
