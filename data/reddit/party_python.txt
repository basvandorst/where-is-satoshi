Thanks! I have a Trezor, but I’m too ill to set it up. So just looking for an easy mobile wallet for next few years until I get better =)

Hey, Exodus is working out nicely for me. Definitely easy enough to use! 
I was wondering if you had any recommendations for exchanges? I’m in the US
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:47:20
Thank you, I’ll check it out.

I’m looking for recommendations for a decent iOS wallet. Any suggestions?
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:37:25
Thanks. Also does the Exodus app use biometrics for security or passwords/codes?

I understand that right now, fossil fuel based heat generation is more cost efficient than electric in many parts of the world. Technically the natural gas you burn isn’t a 100% efficient heater since some energy is lost to entropy as well as incomplete combustion, but I do get your point.
As of now, is more efficient to heat with gas, but your residential furnace is less efficient than a power plant. I guess that’s what I was trying to make, in a pretty poorly worded statement
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:07:51
But the efficiency of a power plant burning fossil fuels is significantly higher than burning it in your house

Yep. Right now, some research is suggesting three distinct subgroups, but that was just based off of preliminary data. So there is still a long ways to go in research, which is why this donation was such a big deal for our community

Yeah. For many of us Mono, which is caused by the Epstein-Barr Virus is how ME/CFS was triggered. However, ME/CFS is a spectrum disorder. So there are people who are bedbound, but also people who can work full time but have to rest all evenings and weekends to keep it up. 
Most people recover from Mono. Some of us unlucky people don’t recover fully but are functioning, and some really unlucky people don’t recover. =/

Thank you for doing so and I’m glad it was able to reach you =)

Congrats =). Luckily I have access to medical marijuana, which just helps slightly reduce the discomfort, so I’m very thankful for pot =D

I’m so sorry to hear that. I know this disease is hard on everyone in he extended family, so I’m sorry you’ve had to deal with that. 
I’m hoping the next ampligen phase three trial will yield better results and get approved with more awareness of ME/CFS than there was in the past =)
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:32:07
Yep. Since getting CFS I’ve also developed Fibro and IBS-D. It’s ridiculous that we have to endure this. I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this too, but I hope you have a good support structure to help you deal with it. =)

One of the main symptoms of this diesease is unrestorative sleep. So every day I wake up, i never feel less tired than when I went to sleep. Some nights, sleeping actually takes energy and you end up feeling even worse in the morning. Like the word “fatigue or tiredness” don’t reflect how significant it is. So resting in the day helps you not feel worse, but doesn’t help you feel better. 
You only start with so many units of energy every day, so resting only slows your use of energy for that part of the day, but it doesn’t help you recharge.

The hardest thing to do with any chronic illness is to ask for help. Hell, after 2.75 yrs I still have problems asking my parents to do my laundry or pre-cutting my food when my arms stip working right. So just reaching out might be helpful for your aunt =), also, the Open Medicine Foundation is on Amazon Smile, so that’s an easy way to help as well.
What’s kinda funny, is me realizing that people have it worse than me is what helps me keep going too hahahaha. We all have our own problems to deal with, but just because people have it worse doesn’t mean what you’re dealing with isn’t awful as well. I hope you’re doing ok too =)
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:31:57
You’re right. Sorry about that.

I’m housebound with ME/CFS whose one major non-profit the Open Medicine Foundation received a $5 Million donation. Even though there 1-2.5 Million people in the US with it, our disease has been ignored by the medical community. This meant so much to us as a patient community so hopefully this will help advance the research to find a treatment. =)
Edit: for those who are interested in learning more about ME/CFS there is a great TED talk by Jennifer Brea 
And if you’d like to watch a documentary on the subject Jennifer Brea did a very good documentary called “Unrest”, which is available on iTunes and Amazon

Chronic fatigue is a symptom. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a disease. See above comments for more elucidation. Also, ME stands for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis which is what this is called in Britain. So that’s how ME/CFS became the name. Hope that helps =)

Chronic Fatigue is not the same as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Chronic fatigue is being tired. My condition essentially feels like constantly having severe mono, and a hangover with your muscles burning like you just did a full body workout to muscle failure, even though you haven’t done any physical activity. Is that what you were asking? =)

That’s the problem these diseases have been facing. At a glance they sound like depression, but lately people have started researching our physiology and realizing that we have a lot of things wrong with our bodies...they just weren’t running the correct tests =)
@_date: 2018-03-06 03:29:44
I feel it absolutely is an autoimmune disease. For context, before getting sick I was getting my PhD in Organic Chemistry hoping to get a job designing/synthesizing new drugs and myself and a few classmates have looked at the research and come to the same conclusion. 
Many autoimmune disorders predominantly affect women and has been written off by the predominantly male medical system as “hysteria” or some other psychosomatic keyword. Other conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus, MS, and others were treated similarly until tests showed that the patients had physiological issues. ME/CFS, Fibromyalgia, IBS and a bunch of other syndromes all seem to affect predominantly women and all have random system-wide symptoms. 
There’s a lot of clues that have been popping up in the research that suggest an auto-immune component, but there isn’t enough evidence to say it 100% is. Also, there’s probably a few different diseases within the diagnosis of ME/CFS, so research hasn’t found a way to do that either. But that’s why we are thrilled about this =)

Glad I could help. =) also, thanks for working in a clinic like that, I’m sure it’s very helpful to those who have access to it.
