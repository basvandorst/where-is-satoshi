No not whatsoever. I'm not that into myself. Just wish more people would be a little more responsible with their crypto. All of these exchanges getting robbed left and right yet folks continue to trust them with large sums of their money. Then they get robbed and it gives crypto a bad name because so much money is lost. Which in turn get a lot of press, look! can't trust crypto! The new potential investor typically doesn't know the difference between exchange wallets and private wallets and subsequently, it turns people away. I don't know a whole lot about trading, I don't trade myself except the occasional exchanging of btc for altcoins but I do that through my wallet. I just don't condone trading crypto in this environment at least. If you're going to buy it, have an offline wallet. If you're going to trade it, then like you said, you accept the risk, sure you can be mad about it, but you accepted that risk at the beginning, you knew (maybe) that when you leave your coins on that exchange, that you are trusting someone you've never met to hold your coins for you. That, in my own opinion, is not smart.  
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:57:29
How do people STILL not get it? If you don't hold the private keys to your bitcoin, you don't own it. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:44:07
I do get that. I understand why traders want fluidity in their assets and that moving from wallet to exchange then back to wallet can cut into profits big time because of tx speed and cost. But my point still stands. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:57:21

@_date: 2017-12-31 02:58:22
I would agree thouroughly
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:18:32
Yeah prices!!!!!  
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:59:13
As of right now, bitcoin is a store of value. It can be used for large enough transactions that would make fees negligible. Implementation of LN may change the ergonomics of btc but I don't think it will be used as a currency until (3) things happen:
1.) Lightning network or similar solution
2.) Wide spread acceptance
3.) Amount of coins remaining to be mined reduces to a 5-6 digit number
These factors will allow for a price stabilization (+/-10%) and network agility making bitcoin more usable in common transactions. Until then the masses don't want to spend. They want to hodl. Doesn't matter if onsey twoseys don't mind buying coffee. You need mass adoption. 
The way I see it is that btc will be a store of value for the majority of our lifetimes, or for however long it stays king of the market. If people want to transact with crypto they will need to exchange to a more fluid currency and consider btc as the "bank". 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:41:51
25% doesn't compare to 4000% in several months. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:11:00
Invest. I'm using bitcoin as an investment. I'm not buying it so I can spend it. I am buying amd mining it so I can hopefully cash out at a comfortable price years down the road. Or, if it's accepted as a currency  I can use it then, but if when it's accepted widely, the price is still trending upwards, I'm going to wait even longer :o
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:41:53
If it rises that high I will do the same brother. What if they told you you could pay for your student loans in BTC back in 10, you just need 20k btc. Don't have It? No problem we can lend you them. You'll just have to pay them back a couple years after you graduate. No problem right? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:23:15
Yeah somebody does! Who is It? Let's make fun of him!
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:30:28
Hmmm... 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:59:07
Well I'm being honest anyway. Am I wrong tho? There  is a good deal of changes that need to be made to buy goods with btc. Until the price stabilizes. That's when it can be used to buy a tesla. Stabilization. Would you buy things with stock? Similar concept when you look at it from that perspective. 
Don't get me wrong I'm all for it 100%. But now isn't the time to be making any transactions w BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:33:02
I agree, i realize its a simple economic concept. I'm all for it! In years to cone tho...  maybe if BTC was more stable I would use it as a currency. But if the grocery store accepted BTC I would still pay in USD, because I know that in two months a dollar is still a dollar. No one is going to buy the 20 dollar bill in my pocket for 40 bucks next month. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:27:06
It is unfortunately stupid. But never-the-less, a reality. I have no doubt it will change and someday hopefully we will all be using some form of crypto as currency. But for now, who would buy a car in BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:38:42
Agreed. 
So what is the logic here? That everyone would be wise to use their crypto as money NOW? How does that help you? 
Or is it better to wait until it's more widely accepted, thus the price has dramatically increased, thus not as much fear of missing out on the next big jump in price. 
Cuz that's all I'm saying. That right NOW, you would have to be either a fool or foolishly rich to buy a 100k car in BTC. 
If grocery stores near you accepted BTC would you make your next purchase in BTC? Honestly..
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:10:11
I think we all understand that no one is getting rich quick at this point. Long term, friend, long term. Get rich/poor quick schemes are ICOs. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:54:33
Yeah and each model he shows  it's a little bit higher every time. So moral of the story is not don't buy, but wait for the crash then buy buy buy buy bitcoin!!!
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:14:15
Right, yet that's where were at right now. If I opened up a car dealership that only accepted BTC I'd close my doors in a month. Because no one wants to spend BTC, just hold. Very very very similar to stocks. 
Now, if I was already rich, and also had a few hundred BTC. Sure I may throw some at a tesla as a "kewl" thing to do and then I'd tweet and post about it and everyone would say how kewl I was, but it's not realistic for the common holder. No one wants to miss out on the next big price increase. That's the reality. Like it or not. 
Fact of the matter is when you buy that Tesla, that car will depreciate in value as soon as it leaves the lot and the very next day your currency will increase in value. It's a lose-lose. Only people w BTC to burn would go for it. And that's hardly anyone right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:31:17
Simple concept if you have that kind of money. I can't buy a 40k car and then buy 40k worth of BTC. If you can do that, great, but I don't have the cash. Not many do. And if you're trying to market this to the layman, you gotta see it through his eyes man. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:32:35
Agreed. I thought I was alone here lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:59:02
Depends on your position really. And what your idea of rich is.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:24:20
Very true indeed. We need wide acceptance covering all ends of the wealth spectrum.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:58:09
Perfect! Later being the key word there. By that time you're going to be able to buy more than just a Tesla. Don't take me out of context, I'm not against using it as a currency. But I sure won't go dumping my BTC on earthly possessions this year. All I'm saying. 
Yeah any store offering sales with BTC is good for BTC, but anyone with enough gall to buy a steals with their BTC right now probably has enough fiat to buy a couple teslas right now too. That doesn't represent the gen pop. Which is the demographic we need to accept bitcoin. Not tesla drivers. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:15:20
Agreed. I do believe that BTC will reach a general stability tho. Maybe not 2% but still relatively stable comparitively speaking. That's just my belief. Either way I'm excited that I will get to experience a good chunk of this tech advanvement in my lifetime. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:27:11
Not entirely true. The reason why it is where it is is because people are buying and bidding on it on exchanges. That's what drives price. Demand. And they aren't demanding it so they can use it at the 711. They are demanding it because they know if they hold it for awhile, it could be worth more than what they bought it for. 
That pizza guy regrets his decision, guaran-damn-teed. Do you want to be the next pizza guy? I don't. 
I really didn't realize people were so ready to spend their crypto already. I thought I wasn't alone in the general sense of "hodling". 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:30:05
It's still decent to mine with a gpu on nicehash. I make about 40 a month in btc with an efficient gpu. I pay an extra 12 bux on my electric but it's still profit!! All the nay sayers about gpu mining are wrong. Sure you can't do anything on slushpool or anything but nicehash isn't bad. Just download and run. It's simple. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:46:24
Yeah!! Goof! Hahaa!!!!!1!!! -cmon who's with us in this  exhilarating name calling?! No one should be able to buy in at lows amd be happy about it anymore!! Only the true btc hipsters (like US) that got in the game early should ever profit from this game! You're just a big goof! Look in the mirror! There's a goof inside there! That's YOU!
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:45:10
Idk if I understand that logic. Please digress. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:38:31
Hahaha! But it will come, maybe not 2020, maybe not 2030, but hopefully by 2040 cuz I'm starting to get old and I'm putting a lot of time and effort into this crypto stuff haha.. And by that time, tesla all around for us BTC people!!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:42:32
Yeah at least that, for whatever it's worth. Has anyone started a donation wallet for him? Lol. Maybe those BTC tesla customers can toss him a few sympathy coins for his notoriety haha. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:08:39
I do want that. But can't we ride this ride for a little longer?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:02:11
Nailed it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:39:32
Yes logically, if I lived in a van, down by the river with my roommate Chris. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:50:35
I guess it was more of an historical example. I'll take 1000% from today too tho!
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:05:00
True. Trust me I'm not hodling forever. But I know these are crucial years. When I'm close to retirement I'll cash out. Maybe even retire a bit early cuz of it;)
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:07:59
Yes. And you won't be moving from that spot. Because you don't have a car ;)
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:01:52
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:30:36
Mild swings are fine, but with this type of deflation, using it as a real currency is ridiculous. Now is not the time is all I'm saying. Someday but not now. I don't disagree with the OP and I hope we can use crypto more and more throughout the coming years. Just not all hyped about the possibility of being able to buy a upper class vehicle with my BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:01:32
I don't have a hole. Haha. It's reality. Currently fiat currency is our payment system. Bitcoin is not. Bitcoin is a store of value right now, not a currency. It will be a currency someday. But not now. I don't see how this is full of holes. Would you purchase an expensive product in BTC if you could right now? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:52:38
Heard dat!
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:07:35
Yes! "Hey guys, bought this car last year with 100k worth of Bitcoin! It was easy!". "Unfortunately I realize this year that I paid 400k for it..." worse than a payday loan.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:12:25
One caveat to this is less debt with deflationary currency. People are less likely to spend on frivolous things and more likely to hold. But yes, bad for the economy overall in the goods sector. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:34:27
100% agree. It's just going to take time. That's all. And when that day comes we will have plenty to spend. It will stabilize to some degree once the hype is over and acceptance is more widespread. But if it continues it's overall upward trend, nobody will want to spend man. It's just a fact. 
The real deal is that it won't become a currency anytime soon. Years. Even decades. I'll be ready when it does though. Because I'm not buying a tesla from Mr. Musk anytime soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:03:23
Until it reaches a price where I'm comfortable with, you're right. Isn't that the general consensus? If not, why not just cash out now?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:13:45
Lol ��
@_date: 2018-03-19 03:50:45
This gets better each time you watch it. I love my memes like i love my women. Cheap raw and quick. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:15:41
So how is it that if you can mine close to 1btc a year with an S9. That it wouldn't be profitable, surely difficulty alone won't drive the price up. Granted difficulty will increase, but not enough to offset the cost. I mean it only costs me 30 a month to ru  the S9. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:41:28
That's cloud mining though. I am interested in that perspective, but if your purchasing virtual mining power, it can have a different roi than physical mining equipment. Maybe? Haha lol 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:28:48
I know that's why I'm turning to Reddit for more experienced miners perspective. If you have mined recently. Speak up, id love to know realistic profit margins. People love to jump on the bandwagon and say don't mine, but always have the same generic answer with no other explanation: "it's not profitable." If it wasn't, wouldn't the asic industry tank?  
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:51:03
I can't believe that difficulty can double every six months is a constant variable. I can see historical it has been this way. But take into consideration block size increase and also the advancement of tech. Current chip size is going to be hard to beat. Within the next few years anyway. Wouldn't that leave one to believe that difficulty increase won't always be so drastic? Maybe I'm wrong. Why or why not?
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:37:26
I know this is a little ridiculous but. 410k for the h20. Uses a lot of elec but if you're already investing might as well invest in solar panels as well. At the current rat of difficulty and given it's has rate, if you had one right now you could mine 12 btc a month with it. All you have to do is pay 13,000 usd electric bills. But with solar, or if you build somewhere w cheap elec, land, and some wind like say... North Dakota?
What about small business as mines? LLCs, Is that a thing? Market goes under you liquidate everything and declare bankruptcy. Or you just keep everything and declare it.
No one can deny that if you had that set up that you'd be making money right now. Haha
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:53:49
Or, is it simple answers from simple people? So you honestly think there is no way other than dump money in, wait for result? The consensus here is that mining is unprofitable at every scale. Why do I find this unbelievable? If I can spend 15 extra dollars a month in electricity, and mine from a pool with my GPU and gross 50 bucks making a 35 dollar profit, paid in btc. How is it not profitable to scale up that operation with an asic miner and reinvest profits into more miners? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:14:59
My apologies of it came off offensive. I'm mearely looking for more information than just, "can't be done" "not profitable" and "buy don't mine". Those, to me, are simple answers to what I think is a more complex question. Mocking the thought of it is not exactly respectable behavior in itself. 
If you're entrenched in the Reddit community of bitcoin, it makes no matter to me. I will return simple answers with a plea for more information. I'm here inspire a conversation. I'm not looking for answers. Or a master plan. Or a get rich quick scheme. I know what my plans are and it wouldn't matter what folks said to dissuade me from mining. It's a hobby so I don't take things personal. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:12:20
Let me know your hardware and elec rate and hash rate. What are the numbers? Are you still turning a profit? Even if it's marginal isn't it still better than investing USD? Because either your stick money in electricity or staight up btc. Either way, if you're turning a marginal profit it's still the same if not better than throwing usd in. Is that not correct?
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:47:06
Besides, with the increased block size, won't that drastically reduce the time difficulty changes? Not as many blocks will be mined, therefore stunting difficulty increases. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 11:00:32
That's very true I may have. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:52:42
Yes! But does every think that is unreasonable? Cuz I think it's definitely reasonable. But I do foresee a different coin coming up to userp the market capitol of btc. But not so fast as 6 years. In which case I believe 40k is definitely a possibility before the "supposed" crash.
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:34:06
Ok, but hasn't the price as well? Haha. Maybe it's just 0.5 btc then, still profitable. 0.25 btc in one year, still profitable. Again, this is betting that btc will keep it's trend for awhile. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:44:06
Are there fees from wallet to wallet txs? I don't seem to notice any. Unless you tx from an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:57:40
Wrong. I mine on my gpu. I pay 15 dollars extra a month in electricity. But make 50usd worth of btc in return. But that's 50 by current value. What if it doubled? Then I just made 100 off that work. It's a mining pool. 
So, in theory couldn't I just scale that operation up with an ASIC miner or 2 and turn the same sort of profit, maybe better considering elec cost/hashrate
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:57:13
Thanks for your insight. I'm gonna hold out through the forks at least. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:52:05
Great insight. It is complicated. The profit is really subjective too. Based off of predictions and speculation. That's why I started this post. I'm not really looking for advice. Just people's ideas and thoughts about more possibilities than just invest. It's too simple of an answer. Yeah, I could stick 50k in and in 6 years it may be worth 1 million. But that's too simple. I'm looking for, is proof of work, and electricity input possibly profitable, even if investment exceeds profit at the current rate. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:26:21
What's the possibility hitting a block solo mining with 3 ASIC machines say, S9? How does it compare to the more profitable pools? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:42:00
But how is that possible when the difficulty won't keep up with the price changes. Given the current market trend. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:30:12
I really can't see why mining and just keeping the coins gained is not profitable. Even if I spent 2.4 k on electricity and a miner and psu and mined say, 0.5 btc in one year. What's the price of the btc in one year? The only way it wouldn't be profitable is if that coin price was less then 5k still. One year from now, and while that's a real possibility, do we as crypto-enthusiasts, truly believe that it will be? I'm leaning towards a 12k one year price... and that's being modest. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:08:02
Ok now were on to something. Considering your correct and I didn't receive until april. Difficulty has doubled, but what if price has more than doubled. And even at the price now if I only got half of it it's still profitable. Even if it were worth 2000 a coin it'd still profitable. It still doesn't add up to me against mining. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:16:54
Yeah but what if you kept reinvesting profits, keeping your balance a few k above zero. Until you did have a lot of equipment. What do you think about HashTanks?
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:44:44
Explain your math. At 12.5 th/s how won't it? Just curious. I know difficulty is a factor but how will it change so drastically?
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:38:38
I know electricians and work in an engineering firm, we have elec engineers that have been consulted with. We know the electrical logistics, one we don't know, which is a great point is tiered electric cost. I'll have to check that. Hopefully not. We will see. Yes monitoring is easy. We live in the north so cooling this winter is no problem haha. 
And yes we could be bought 0.75 btc but then it stops there. Np more. If I can mine 0.5-0.75 ntc in a year, then I can keep going and get more. If I just have 0.75, then that's it, unless I stick more in. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:02:09
Obviously I don't have 100% faith in mining. I'm not an idiot. I know that "if it were that easy wed all be millionaires", and "its not profitable" add the typical other negative comment.  
But for the sake of conversation and sheer speculation. I opened this topic to discuss any and all various POSSIBILITIES. Not sure fire plans. So thanks for the typical comment. You've done nothing to progress the idea. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 04:16:33
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:26:42
Cheap answer. Elaborate. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:24:23
I did the math. That doesn't add up. So here it is:
If I invest 2k in buying a miner and psu, then 340 in electricity a year to run it I'm in it for 2.4k. If I can possibly earn 0.75 btc with difficulty already factored in in that years time, even if btc holds at 5700 I make profit. If it goes up 4x then I kill the profit and still am left with a tool I can earn more with.
If I invest 2.4k in btc and it goes up to, say 10k in a year, I only make 4.8 k or less. And I am done once I cash out. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:02:06
Bitmain November batch. Even if it is months, yes difficulty will change but price will  (hopefully) go up. Considering that, wouldn't they even out? Yes it's only 3 miners, but either way investment in 3 roi is the same as investment in 30 roi, so big or small, why do people mine if it isn't profitable? Cuz the numbers look juicy enough to me. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:09:43
Because they're making tons of money and being paid in BTC as it is. And profit margins exceed value of BTC. So yeah, if I could engineer tiny cpus and sell asic computers, I would too lol.  
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:55:09
Cool thanks. I definitely enjoy it as a hobby that could potentially be profitable. Yeah I wish I would've got into it when I first heard about it in 2010, but don't we all? Haha. Who knows, I may just hold on to my btc. But right now I definitely am leaning towards investing it in equipment and holding on to the mined coins until it's well worth cashing out. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:54:52
At its trend will bit coin hit 10k be next year this time? Why or why not??
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:50:37
Exactly. Easy. Just have 5 zeros of dispensable cash in your bank. Other ideas??
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:24:55
Right that's why I was thinking Asics. How long can the s9 keep from being obsolete or unprofitable. At even 11-12 TH/S it would only cost around 30 a month to run. 60 max. Right? If it uses 1275kw at a rate of .09-.11 per kw/h (depending on power costs) still puts you in a profitable region. Plus pool fees. And taxes. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:54:11
Agreed. I bought approximately 2k worth of btc at the middle of the upsurge and I've already made enough to get a few hundred bucks off my initial bitmain investment, which I'm forwarding to my electricity cost for the year. Plus if I hold out the remaining btc through all the splits, I could possibly stand to gain a few hundred on the air drops. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:40:21
But what if a person doesn't have the capitol. Obviously you could make a million of you had 100k to invest and the coin went to 50,000 by 2023. But that's not the point.
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:55:48
Explain. Someone give me something more than. Scam, not worth it, invest. Why? Why if I can mine at least .76 btc a year that's factoring in difficulty increase, and a miner costs 1800 and elec a year is 400. So, I'm making potentially 4k a year without price trend increase factored in. How? How is it not profitable. I calculate 300-400% profit. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:19:08
So if you're mining in a pool you arent mining btc? I know nicehash pays out in ntc but you mine a conglomeration of coins. If you're running asic machines and you join a pool, you're not mining btc?
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:54:08
You know you're in the 21st century when terminology originated in games like counterstrike makes it's way into the financial sector.
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:32:03
But they get paid in btc, which has potential to explode. So, aren't they the same as all of us? Hedging their bets? Why take 1.265k usd when you can take 0.25 btc and the price goes up. It's easier to make a product and get paid in the result of your product, than to use your product to mine with. The logistics make more sense to sell asic miners than to produce and use them.

Right, it wasn't profitable back then. That makes sense because price per kwh exceeds btc value. But, you invested elec in the coin. Without that there would be no value. Did you get coins? If so did you sell? Even if the roi wasn't immediately there, if you held on for years, would it have been??
