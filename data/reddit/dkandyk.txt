I have a feeling something big is about to happen to bitcoin much larger than hf.
All factors are seem to be sell sell sell 
But I think it is buy buy buy 
Just based on years of experience in options/futures trading 
Oil is buy buy buy all 2 year options

This is due to hydro power seasonal change. 
Do not get excited the hash rate will grow
@_date: 2018-10-30 17:44:32
download here: [
go into you miner 
click on upgrade and upgrde
Be aware current LP (low power mode) from Bitmain will slow down your S9. most miners slow down 4-8% in 3 days. Power savings are 10%-15%
@_date: 2017-01-23 03:15:53
@_date: 2017-01-14 23:43:18
these are older machines that hash at a lower rate.

this firmware will save you money on power no hash rate increase.
you cannot use it to increase hash rate
Oct23 is the correct version
there is a lot of hidden fees firmware to increase hash
save time for research use this only : [ and donot overclock over 725
prefreably 712. depending on your version of s9 use 880V or 900 file.

Really  google this issue and see both arguments than start making a valid point
@_date: 2017-01-09 03:25:41
it is hard to predict
it depends on your electricity cost and bitcoin price. there will be nothing significantly better than S9 within 1.5 year.
Chips cannot get any smaller and only tiny improvements in power consumption can be made.

Nonsense 
I rather have Btc go to 0 than segwit 
Miners are not greedy 
Do the math and see what returns they make
With the difficulty rate increasing as it has been 
Miners are only profitable if they pay 1c per kW
Or in other words if steal the electricity 
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:33:58
As per articles 25% chance 
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:33:10
it is not in the miners interests. core is too greedy and does not want to  take miners into consideration. Without miners there is no bitcoin and no blockchain. Eventually they will realize that everyone's interests have to be included.
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:04:59
Super huge

It is a sad moment it looks like it will continue to be increasing at much higher rates than before
@_date: 2016-12-15 16:33:01
it is very profitable right now. in order to make some real money you have to have real money to invest. google data centers for power rate.
if BTC will continue to go up and the difficulty rate will increase as it has been it will be very profitable.
@_date: 2016-11-23 02:10:57
it will never be profitable to mine at 13c
even if btc is 10,000$ you will have more miners where electricity is 2.5c
consider renting in Labrador Canada. electricity there is 2.5 c CAD which is 1.8c USD
@_date: 2016-12-03 03:43:29
it will be another nearly 100 years before they are all mined

I rent an industrial 30,000 sq feet unit and have my main business running there. So no power issues there.
Looks like I have nothing else but aliexpress since no one is offering warranty anyhow.

I actually like it
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:19:25
this is a very good news 
It is likely to be the reason  for btc to be down today. This is how I look at it : Institutions/whales are no longer willing to put money for the price to go down 
so they sold to retail investors and bough back in on futures with margins. 
This is a bigger and more positive event then btc doubling. 
I could be mistaken but at least it makes sense. There might be other reasons for this to happen but this is a textbook example of stock market manipulation.

You did not reply with tour credentials.
Even after my explanation how a datacenter works and how much it costs ( I built and manage 4. here is my site  bitcoinmimerhosting.com
If you Google my name you will see I recently sold 2 data centers to a public company.
Please stop making childish claims and stop sucking people into some kind of fraud.
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:27:59
Also you contradict yourself with 2 different prices for s9 and kw/h   
42 per antminer is not equal to 4.5 c per kw/h
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:42:26
Sounds like a scam
If you believe in magic ask to come and see the datacenter.
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:56:22
Indicate  your data center address and other credentials 
If you have 6c electricity cost plus say 1.5 c to maintain plus say 3 c for building data center you have to charge 10.5c per kW/h
Math does not add up
How about profit??? 12c per kw/h
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:27:30
No it does not. The value that you are referring to is debt. Moreover, 1000% leverage of that debt is your value. It is only backed up by rockets and missiles. One might look at it this way also that one day this debt has to be paid off with interest rates rising , no real world economy growth , aging population, instability, trade wars etc. However, in a short run you have a point, which i also cover in my first if statement.
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:32:11
I would rather stay in Canada and pay what I pay then go to Venezuela Iran or ex USSR and risk my investment or life for that mater.
@_date: 2019-01-20 15:47:57
It might or might not.
Why are you concerned?
If you are a trader then trade it.
If you are a hodler hold it nothing happened it still does what it is supposed to do it is still secure and more decentralized now.

the bottom will come once there is volume spikes. any number is irrelevant until volume sufficiently increases.
It is traders market right now no fundamentals are being considered.

We have to get 5 times more efficient
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:19:57
if the feds would not do it we would have another 2008. btw thy are pumping money every day for the next 2 weeks. Banks are unable to lend to each other. Sound familiar ah....
Banks are no longer liquid. Interest rate cuts is soon to be no longer an option. Next step is depression not recession.  the longer it drags the worse it is going to be. Buy Gold and BTC and ETH and get rid of anything else. Be sure to have enough fiat to last 3-6 months. Watch everyone going through pain but survive yorself.  Now ask yourself  question if btc is ran down to 6k 5k or whatever. Do you care?
I do not I am not planning to sell it before financial system will cease to exist as we know it.
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:16:14

And no Vitalik 
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:35:02
yes one month warranty is included
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:37:05
This is likely due to large mines moving to a cheaper power facility. For instance in  Iran electricity costs 0.006$ per kW an hour
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:11:01


Wait for what? they are not planning to resale them. Original Bitmain warranty is 3 months and you can not get them serviced since you cannot get them to China due to customs regulations. So original warranty is nonexistent. Availability is nonexistent even in the future. Thank you for your comments though.
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:35:53
S9 hashing board is not the same. You cannot disassemble r4. its design is different. you have to send the whole unit. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:43:30
Please advise on how to get a better deal. I see them on Amazon for 3000 plus
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:19:11
Rent the hash rate instead and the cost will be just above cost of the electricity
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:05:23
1. They are no longer available
2. if they were you would be looking into 2 months plus shipping time delays.
Any valid arguments?
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:24:47
No you cannot. I tried. You can get them to Hong Kong and then to Bitmain. 50% chance they will be turned around. If they do not prepare to pay 30-40% shipping
