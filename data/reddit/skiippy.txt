Is there a use for merkle tree pruning as described in the whitepaper? I'm thinking it would allow SPV proofs for anything that's currently in the UTXO, while still allowing pruning.

I would classify them as competitors, actually. When the internet first came out, people could have decided to use the same protocols to build a separate, distinct network.
I don't personally see any use in doing something like that, and that's how I tend to view altcoins. Not to denigrate others' investments... there are plenty of arguments you can make in favour of altcoins, that's just my view of things.
I think improvements will be made to bitcoin over time, as opposed to it being replaced wholesale by another currency. I'm sure there will be lots of experimentation in altcoins, and bitcoin can probably use anything that comes out of that.
The big breakthrough for me is just the blockchain itself, it's not like the scripting engine or p2p network are, or need to be, revolutionary. I haven't seen any altcoins that demonstrate a breakthrough on par with the blockchain, yet.
I do think we'll see lots of crypto-"currencies" in the future, though. I put currencies in quotes because, like paper money, you can have things like monopoly money. I'm sure the technology behind bitcoin will be used for all sorts of things that closely resemble money. But I don't think they'll achieve global currency status due to bitcoin being first, and there being no need for a second.
I can't wait to see how it actually plays out. :)

Fiber is fast enough, so if you want to help power the bitcoin backbone of the future you're almost certainly going to need a fiber connection to do so. The vast majority of the population is not going to be inclined to, I imagine.
Edit: this is also where decentralization becomes a balancing act. As it stands today, a bitcoin node is easily runnable for a huge number of people. But also as it stands today, bitcoin can only allow for about 0.01% of the population to use it on any given day. This is why I see not raising the 7tps limit as a complete non-starter. Some would keep bitcoin so decentralized that in the end, only a very small few can even use it.

That's unfortunate. I have no Android dev experience, but I assume it's possible to bundle a supported font in bitcoin-specific applications.

I replied on another thread as well, you can actually use the block headers to prevent smaller blocks from being favoured over larger blocks, I think. You can broadcast the header first, and it will take precedence as the longest chain over any other block headers you see while you are busy doing the actual validation.
If nodes generally adopted this rule, I think miners would also be incentivized to mine empty blocks while they are doing the actual validation. I don't see that as a big deal since it'd only happen for blocks found really close together, and you've dramatically increased the potential transaction rate as a result.
Using this as an attack vector shouldn't be too much of a concern because you need to mine the header, even for an invalid block, so in practice such a header should rarely be seen.
@_date: 2014-02-15 02:41:03
Yeah, while I do think there is huge profit potential for those with the means to take a risk, I tend not to touch on those aspects of bitcoin when I advocate for it. I'm in love with bitcoin as a technology, and I don't want anyone making investments on my word. ;)

I brought up the $5 example just to illustrate why every bitcoin transaction shouldn't be inherently reversible (not that you were necessarily saying that).
Interesting scenario with NewEgg. A lot of times escrow gets brought up in the context of services like eBay, where bitcoin-style escrow would be very useful.
When you have someone like NewEgg refusing refunds though, there's a good chance you wouldn't have bothered using escrow because you trusted the merchant you were dealing with.
I'm not sure what would be the best solution to this. You're right that it'll probably involve a third-party, with the attendant costs, but I think that's fine because you're opting into that service when you want it. We'll probably see a variety of solutions tried until one emerges that sticks, you've brought up some good ideas yourself.
@_date: 2014-06-22 21:09:32
It's bitcoin in and out only, so no direct dollar transfers.
The big advantage is that you get all the power of a bitcoin wallet with none of the volatility risk. So if you want to get paid in bitcoin, you can now do so without having to worry about price fluctuations at all. How much of your balance you keep in another currency, and how much directly in bitcoin, would then be up to you. But you still get the full power of bitcoin either way.

Just thinking about potential risks that could kill off bitcoin, an altcoin managing to take over is what I currently think would be the most likely. Nothing really calculated, just thinking about various possibilities.
I'm extremely confident in the protocol itself, I don't really worry about a break in it at all. Altcoins strikes me as the next biggest risk, but I don't actually see that as very likely either. I think bitcoin will succeed, in other words.
I do think about the personal risk of the confidence I place in my own confidence.. it's what helps me not make rash decisions. ;)

Bitreserve offers this. I have an account there but haven't actually tried them out yet.

This is why we need more implementations going forward. Both of those issues were implementation bugs, not protocol bugs. Once we have a more diverse ecosystem, these sorts of things shouldn't happen.

Awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-29 01:33:46
That could be implemented, but I was under the impression that it's not currently done that way either.
What I'm curious about is if it's possible to download the block in chunks on 256, 512, etc. transactions, and then verify that chunk is valid using the merkle root.
That would let you publish the header first, and then start streaming out the block, and the entire network could be in the process of downloading and validating that block before you're even finished uploading it.
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:10:26
I personally think implementing any rule beyond "longest PoW chain wins" is going to have far worse consequences, long term, than anything that is currently happening.
Bitcoin mining is a young industry, and it currently seems to be filled with some pretty incompetent players. I think that the current incentives are correct, and we just need to let things play out and the allow the industry to mature.
If cex.io is so successful, I think others will come along that want to compete with them. Eventually we should end up with a more diverse set of competent, competing pools.
Having competent ASIC manufacturers would be immensely helpful, also.

The propagation time is very important to block size, this work would decouple block size from the propagation time.
Currently when you start increasing the block size, you introduce an ever increasing latency in the block propagation. That latency will limit the workable block size, even if you have the throughput to handle the increased volume.
With something like this in place, we can start to scale block size arbitrarily, taking advantage of increases in bandwidth, cpu power, etc.

Bitcoin won't discriminate against people based on their political views, and using bitcoin isn't going to turn people into libertarians. I think we're just seeing a shift in the demographics of the people using bitcoin.

My personal goal is to figure out how we can get into the thousands of transactions per second on today's hardware, with a few caveats.
You'd need fiber internet, no getting around that. You'd need a large-ish pool of SSD storage, and you'd probably need a dedicated card for off-loading signature validation.
I think that it's possible to architect the software in such a way that allows for this kind of scale, without changes to the protocol. Everything needs to be done in a streaming fashion, and as much as can possibly be parallelized needs to be parallelized.
You also need to be able to stream out blocks across the network. Waiting to download an entire block and validating it, before relaying, won't work.
If you have an add-in card that can validate signatures into the tens of thousands per second, you need a way to actually feed it data at that rate. With SSDs and clever design, I think it could be possible.

No, I'm working on a node written in c but it's not even remotely complete just yet. :) That time does include full validation, not that I'm fully rules compliant.
I'm holding blocks in memory just long enough to calculate the unspent outputs, so I'm writing far less to the disk than bitcoin-core does; it's not an entirely fair comparison. But for a home system, most aren't going to want to store the entire blockchain anyway.

Right, I just mean that if we do transition to bit, millibit won't be confusing because we'll know that it means millibitcoin, even though no one actually uses that word. If we transition to bit, I expect that using millibits will fade away.

I think there'll be a lot of incentive for merchants and payment providers to run full nodes as well, and they'll have the budget for this.
How long until we see turn-key nodes I wonder? Plug it in, hook up the network, and it does its thing. Maybe we'll have some signature-verifying ASICs in there too.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:23:58
Right, I said hundreds and thousands currently, so that's fine CPU wise.
100 transactions per second would be 0.8Mbps, at 1kB per transaction. That would certainly eliminate a chunk of internet users, but it's still pretty low bandwidth by today's standards. Even bumping that to 1000 transactions per second today is still somewhat reasonable, my home connection would handle that no problem.
I don't see it as a big deal if most home users can't run a full node. In the long term, I doubt home desktops will make up a significant portion of the full verifying network. I don't think that that many people will really care to, or necessarily even know what that means.
For those who do care, bitcoin should remain attainable for the home user with high-endish hardware and internet.
Edit: To expand a bit, I think a small amount of home users running full nodes could still potentially end up numbering in the millions, worldwide. And I think there will be many, many businesses with the incentive to run full nodes for themselves, and as a service to others. I think it'll still end up being pretty decentralized.
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:04:54
It doesn't need to. Once the software is upgraded, existing systems will be able to process far more transactions per second. My home computer and internet connection will be sufficient to handle Visa-level traffic, for example, but I'd run out of storage space until the software does transaction pruning.
Getting up into the tens and hundreds of thousands per second on a home computer is what we'll need Moore's help with.

I'm not certain if this is feasible or not, but if you accept the current longest chain based on the block header alone, it won't matter if your block is larger or smaller. As long as you can download and validate the block before another one is found, the large block will still win.
The p2p network is pretty bare bones today, but that's fine as it works well enough for now. There is a ton of work that can be done to make sure that large blocks make sense for miners, and changing the p2p side of things is pretty easy.

Do you think it'd be possible to make a dollar-pegged wallet instead? There's still the risk when the price goes down, but I wonder if it'd be more manageable with dollar-pegging vs. an interest rate. Not a financial guy here, at all. :)
If it was doable, it'd be handy to be able to portion out amounts of money to be pegged to the dollar, while still retaining all the abilities of a cloud wallet.

I could probably whip that up fairly quickly, although I'm not sure what the structure of bootstrap.dat is... I assume it's not super fancy.
The main thing would be tweaking the block requester a bit as it looks at the processed chain state for current progress. I'd just need an interface to abstract the fact that I might be downloading to BitSharp's storage for processing, or I might just be downloading to some file directly.

@_date: 2014-02-04 21:48:45
You only need to keep track of bitcoin that hasn't been spent yet. Old transactions can be removed once they have been spent to reclaim disk space. You would only need enough storage to hold onto a few months worth of old transactions at a time.
Full copies back to the genesis block will still be around, it's not that much data for companies to store. But you can still run a full node without needing that full copy yourself.
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:04:25
Yeah, if I'm understanding this correctly it doesn't have anything to do with security. Just speed, as you say.
The issue with transmitting the blocks around is that you already have the vast majority of the data that the block contains. Even if you're only transmitting the tx hashes, that's still sending a bunch of data that you already have.
This is about communicating blocks across the network faster, in light of the fact that you already have all/most of their data. Nothing to do with changing anything about blocks themselves.
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:35:14
If you use millibits, then you are already using bits as a unit. A millibit is just one thousandth of that unit. Logically that works just fine.
If you use millibits without first defining what a bit is, however, that doesn't work. You can't have a standard SI prefix on a unit that you haven't defined.
Edit: Put another way, if you prefer to use millibits then I am going to ask: "I have one thousand millibits, so I have one bit. What is a bit?"

This is exactly the sort of thing that will be powered by bitcoin in the future, however.  Having your mobile provider give you access to a mobile text wallet is a nice selling feature. I would assume it's not powered by bitcoin currently, but we won't be able to assume that forever. :)

Not at all, I'm just trying to imagine potentially beneficial regulations.
My hope is that due to the unregulatable nature of the protocol itself, we'll see various states/countries competing to write the most pro-consumer, pro-business, tax-revenue-attracting regulation they can. We'll see. :)
@_date: 2014-08-16 01:11:43
Yep, that's the case. That's part of why I haven't looked at implementing any of those rules. Fortunately, the interface into that is pretty basic... you just give it a piece of data and it says yes it's valid or no it's not. That leaves me plenty of room to figure out the design of everything else.
If I were starting to implement those rules, the code would be the specification as you say. I'd have to look at the c++ code and make sure I port exactly that.
There's a good c# project here that ports the c++ code: 
One of the nice things about bitcoin is that we have an awesome built-in test suite layer with the network protocol. I don't know how complete the pull tester is, but it generates data to test out various edge cases.  You just startup your node and let it talk to the pull tester over the network protocol. As long as the two agree, you know you're good. Over time, test suites like this can be evolved to cover every edge case we ever find.

My home connection handles several 10Mbps of traffic actually. You're right though, unfortunately for most home users they won't be able to handle this level of traffic.
It'll be an interesting trade-off for the developers, balancing the needs of the network with the general crappy-ness of most ISPs. For businesses the level of resources required isn't an issue, but it would be ideal if most home computers remained able to power the network.
We may go through a phase where most home systems won't be able to help power the network, but that should still shift as the landscape improves.
@_date: 2014-08-11 11:05:38
This is just a way to communicate faster at the network layer. Once you've received the block data using this faster method, you still do all the normal validation.

Since we don't currently have a "bit", "millibit" should actually be "millibitcoin". My comment was written under the assumption that we've moved to "bit" as being a "microbitcoin". If that happens, "millibit" could have been ambiguous during the transition period, but since we'd never use "milli" with the new "bit", there's no actual confusion.
If "millibit" were to stick around beyond some transition period, I agree that would be very, very confusing.

These things take time, and big changes to the core of bitcoin are not to made lightly. There's lots of work ongoing to figure out the best way to address this, and those changes will be made slowly and methodically.
We should be ready before we need it, yes, but we also don't want to rush changes in too soon when we still have time to work them out.

Good point on the dollar sign.
The only difference there would be that generally the doubles lines are still drawn all the way through the S, unlike with the B where the double lines just come out of the top and bottom. That subtle difference doesn't make things as inconsistent as I was thinking they were, however.
Seeing both kinds of B symbol used in a single application still seems like it would be jarring to me... but maybe not. I only mention that again because you're forced into using ฿ for rendering text, which you are likely to want to do.

Scaling the I/O is what I'm working hard on with my own node. I'm currently able to do a few thousand transactions per second, with my SSD.
I have it designed so that you can balance the load across multiple disks (although I only have the one SSD to work with). I've tried to allow for as much concurrency as I can, in general.
Currently I'm sitting at about 3.5 hours to download and fully sync and prune the blockchain. That's with script execution disabled, but I'm running all the needed data through and can feed off script execution in parallel, if I had enough CPU to handle that.
The UTXO size would be a lot larger if we had thousands of transactions per second, so that'd slow things down. But I'd really like to be able to handle that kind of load on a reasonably powerful home desktop machine.

Excuse me? I did not lie, I indicated that I thought it worked everywhere, but it turns out that is not the case.
I would love to have the B with two lines as well, my whole point is that this symbol cannot be typed, which is a pretty big issue.

Are you thinking something like creating a bootstrap.dat using this? That's definitely possible, and would cut the time down from 4 hours quite a bit. You could bypass torrenting entirely, although I'm not sure how good for the network that'd be.
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:37:34
There's also a lot that can be done at the network level to support higher transaction rates. The p2p network, as it stands today, is barbarically simple. :) It's perfectly fine for now, but there are lots of things that can be done to improve its performance for high transaction rates.
Valid block headers have to be mined, regardless of whether the block body is valid or not. This is really handy because it means you can assume that in the vast majority of cases, a valid block header will represent a valid block. Seeing a valid block header mined against an invalid block should be an exceedingly rare event.
You could use that to do something like broadcasting the header first, which is always going to be 80 bytes, and then streaming out the contents of that block to your peers. There's no reason for you to have to send the entire block out before your peers start retransmitting it, you can do it in chunks. I think. :)
If that does work, it also means everyone can start validating the block as it comes down the pipe, without needing to wait for it to be fully downloaded.

The new usage of bit would never involve millibits, so it wouldn't be ambiguous in that regard, same with microbits. If you're using a fractional SI unit, you know it has to be the current Bitcoin unit. The new bit would only go as low as talking about cents.

Transactions are mostly random data, so there's probably not much that can be done to make them smaller than they are now. They're pretty tiny already, though, and the input script portion doesn't necessarily need to be kept around.
If we scale to those levels a fiber connection will be a must. I don't think bitcoin will be held back by home users without fiber (read: held back by their ISPs) as I doubt many home users will want to run full nodes anyway.
Home users who do want to run full nodes are going to need good hardware and internet at that scale, but I think that's achievable on the time scale where we'd hit that scale. I hope. :)

I did, but I'm not particularly concerned about it... yet. If we find ourselves in the same situation once we have a more mature mining industry, that would be pretty bad.
"GHash makes money, why should I let them have all the fun? I want some of that money for myself!"
^^ We need more people who think like this and who want to out compete them. I'm not sure what % of hash power we'll see end up in pools, but ideally it'll be spread across a bunch of pools that are all competing against each other full out on the service that they provide.
I don't feel certain about this, it's tricky to think about. But as it stands today, I don't yet see this a technical failure on the part of POW. I see it as a short term market failure... growing pains.
I don't mean to say we should just pretend there's no problem either and that we should just wait for things to blow up. But it's entirely possible that we could make a change now to fix a short term issue that would actually end up being more harmful in the long run. In my opinion, a POW change isn't yet justified until we've had a chance to see the mining industry mature and play out a bit more.

I think the reason that won't be an issue is because bitcoin itself has value. You're less likely to toss money than you are to toss myspace for facebook.
Bitcoin may be small enough that this could still happen, there are really very few people that own it currently. As long as its momentum continues a bit longer, though, I think we'll pass the point of no return.

No trust needed, you'd have to mine a bad block the same as a good block. And you'd still be validating the block, even when you download just the header first, so no bad blocks could get through.

From what I understand, it's too late after the long string of blocks have been found, you have to roll the dice on doing the attack first. You can't wait to see if you would have found enough blocks and then do the attack. It's too late at that point, because the long string you found is already set in stone.

No worries, I have my registry edited so I can type ฿, Ƀ, and ƀ quite easily. (EnableHexNumPad)
I'm not gonna be 100% on board with ฿ until we use that consistently for our symbol though. Right now we have two: ฿ and the double-line B.
I don't think "do I want to type it?" is a good way to choose which symbol should be used. And if I'm putting up a web page, I could put a graphic with double-line B, or I could type in ฿. Both work, so which is correct?
Edit: Another scenario, if I need to put ฿ in a single text box, list box, etc. in my application, it now means I can't show the double-line B anywhere without looking horribly inconsistent.

Just thinking out loud here.
I wonder if we might see these costs move onto wallet providers? So somebody like GreenAddress could offer you protection when you make a purchase, and they're the party that you'd deal with when you want a refund. It'd then be on GreenAddress to price that protection accordingly, depending on the merchant you are shopping with.
So if you are shopping at a merchant with a poor reputation, in GreenAddress's eyes, that protection is going to cost more. And buying from a merchant with a good reputation will cost less.
You'd then decide what wallet provider you think offers the best protection, and the wallet provider would have to do its best job determining reputation, or they go broke paying out refunds.
Edit: Just noticed your edit above, and I think we're actually thinking about very similar things. :)

I'm working on a validating, pruning node that can handle thousands of transactions per second.
Current sync time from genesis is 4 hours, using an SSD.
@_date: 2014-06-24 15:32:23
Thanks for that! One idea I've been wondering about, that I don't see mentioned in that paper, is to broadcast the blocks in chunks. This would be in addition to the propagation changes they already mentioned.
I'm not certain is this is actually possible, but I wonder if you could send out a 1GB block in chunks of e.g. 1000 transactions at a time. I'm thinking that the merkle root could be used to prove that the chunk you've sent is actually a part of the block you are looking to download. You'd be downloading the block bittorrent style, essentially.
If this works, by the time a node that has found a new block has finished uploading that block to the network, the entirety of the network may have already downloaded e.g. 50% of the block and finished validating that. 
I really need to sit down and see if the merkle root can be used in that manner. I'm sure I'm not the first person to consider this... I really need to catch up on what developer discussion has gone into this area as well.
@_date: 2014-08-11 15:46:14
Nope, when you're doing full validation (what nodes do) you're validating every transaction in the block. So there's no effect on the data that you're validating, you're just receiving the data to be validated more efficiently.
The 1500 missing is just referring to how much data you can be missing while still allowing you to communicate the block in this fashion. At the end of the day you still have to receive the entire block. If the 1500 part failed then you'd download the block in the old, slow fashion.
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:26:44
That's a really tricky question, I added an edit to my comment where I mention how that turns into a balancing act.
I'd be surprised if any major pools were running today on less than a kick-ass internet connection. Even if they don't currently, at the scale they operate at I don't think it'll be an issue going forward for them to have good internet.
For a home user, it becomes trickier. I don't think we can allow bitcoin to be limited by crappy home internet connections, but I also think it's important to make sure that there enough home users that are running bitcoin nodes. What "enough" is, I'm not sure.
Businesses can also play a big role. I don't mind if most nodes are run by businesses, as long as their geographies and interests span a wide enough spectrum. I hope that there'll be all kinds of businesses that want to run their own nodes.
I am actually working on-again off-again on my own node, with my main focus being on how I can come up with a design that can scale to the required level. I have no idea where my own work will ultimately lead, but based on that work I feel comfortable that other nodes will certainly be able to scale to the levels needed.
I'm not sure what's currently being done in bitcoin core, bitcoinj, btcd, etc. to directly address scalability, today.

@_date: 2014-06-30 17:23:46
I'm just focusing on designing software that can run at that scale, so that it can then come down to a decision of what's best for the network, as opposed to "there's no way the software can even handle this speed". As the software currently stands, if you threw a bunch of hardware at it, I don't think it'd actually take advantage of that to its full capacity.
I think accepting headers first is the best way to address the orphan rate, which also eliminates the favouring of small blocks over large blocks that we see now. I know one common criticism there is that you then need to mine empty blocks on top of headers, but I think a drastic increase in the transaction rate the network can process would more than make up for this. Any thoughts on this?
I think we'll also see supernodes when it comes to things like storing the entire blockchain, unpruned, and also things like indexing every single transaction that has ever occurred. That's going to require big hardware, but for just the basic validation required to drive the network, I'd like to keep that runnable on a (high-end) desktop system with good internet.
In actuality, I'd expect the number of home users running bitcoin nodes in 5-10 years to be pretty tiny, even if it's technically feasible. But I think keeping it feasible will be an important check.

I think what he's saying is that if you already have all the transactions that make up a block then you can receive that block in a constant sized message, regardless of how many transactions actually make up the block.
All the transaction data is already flying around the network and being verified ahead of time. So long as you can keep up at that rate, you could receive new blocks "instantly".

Not fuck them, actually, anyway... I'm not saying it's perfect, but there's going to be inevitable confusion no matter what change is made.
If we're expecting to use bit with the ubit proposal anyway, as the original post suggests, I'd like to use what's best long term, since short term confusion will be inevitable.
ubit will have its own confusion if everyone ends up referring to them as bits. Then you have to explain that there's actually a silent micro in front of every bit.
Having a silent SI prefix, forever, strikes me as being worse than the short term confusion of switching to bit as a microbitcoin. I've seen some others point to the bit proposal as a butchering of the SI system, I think silent prefixes is the true butchering. ;)

My first ever tip, thanks! :)
@_date: 2014-05-17 11:42:40
Ahh, right. I was really missing the obvious there. :) Thinking about that a bit, I'm less concerned about that just because it would require a hard fork in order to implement.
Individual services like circle could blacklist sending to certain addresses, which I see as trivial to get around. Blacklisting bitcoin that's already on the blockchain would require a hard fork and consensus across the bitcoin network.
The reason I'm not too concerned about that is that if you can hard fork a blacklist, you can also just hard fork taking the bitcoin away directly... it's not like you'd need to respect the digital signature. I can't see the network consenting to that.

I'm currently working on this with my own node, if you're curious to check it out:
Since everything is woefully under-documented right now (still prototyping), here's where you'll want to look for the pruning:
@_date: 2014-06-18 22:49:48
Are pools necessarily such a bad thing? They lower the barrier to entry for miners.
If they are honest miners, they'll immediately switch pools if the pool they're using were to carry out an attack. True, this isn't providing as much security to the network, per hash per second, as that same miner running their own fully validating node, but it does still increase the hash rate being provided by honest players.
There are rules such a miner could implement as well, like not mining on any headers that aren't publicly identifiable as belonging to the pool they use.
This lets a small miner get started with nothing more than a cheap ASIC and something like a raspberry pi. It should be more feasible once ASICs are fully caught up to the latest process technology, and then its a race to the bottom on their price, I think.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:17:51
I could not agree more. My biggest fear in all of this is that POW will be changed to address what should be a short term issue. Fortunately, it does not appear that the core devs are looking to do that. I think this would be far more harmful than cex.io temporarily having 50% of the network.
Of course, if they still have 50% in a couple years I'd say I was dead wrong.

Pruning will actually allow the throughput to go up. If block sizes remained at 1MB, we wouldn't need pruning at all. The data would always grow, but it would still be such a small amount of data that it doesn't matter.
Pruning can allow us to get to very high transaction speeds as everything else about the bitcoin network can already scale into the hundreds and thousands of transactions per second. We can't keep that amount of data around forever, though.
If you think beyond home desktops, bitcoin could reach significantly higher than thousands of transactions per second.

Sure, but some of those "you can't do this" regulations applied to bitcoin companies might actually help them attract consumers. Especially if a horror story comes out of an unregulated environment.
Again, my hope is that states/countries are forced to compete on good regulations, because anything else just drives business elsewhere. Anyone in the world can start a coinbase, and anyone in the world can start using them, after all.
I'm still not sure what good regulation might look like myself, but we may find out. Bitcoin is in a unique position to force officials to play by a fair set of rules, or miss losing out on business in their area.
Take the example of New York, maybe they'll come out with absolutely horrendous regulations this year. Now evolve that forward in time... I just don't see how those kinds of regulations survive in the long term.

It's great to hear that the validation is being turned into a library. That'd give me a huge leg up in turning this into something useful!
I didn't realize this was being done, is there some place I can track that work?

@_date: 2014-06-09 10:38:07
That would only work if they also orphaned blocks that didn't meet their criteria, which would be considered an attack. If they don't, transactions they don't like will still show up in other blocks, so they'd only have a reduced confirmation time.
@_date: 2014-06-30 18:09:18
To give a better idea of what I mean, imagine I can get the core, inner UTXO update loop running at 30ktps. That wouldn't involve any script validation or signature checking. If you then have 4 cpus that can each process scripts at 7.5ktps each, I should be able to feed those with data, completely in parallel, with no reduction in the 30ktps rate. As part of that, I'm also aiming to be able to be able to load previous outputs in parallel.
If those CPUs can operate faster than the core loop I won't be able to feed them at full capacity, but that inner loop should be what sets the speed limit for the rest of the system.
So I'm aiming for as much parallelism as I can get, and I also want to eliminate any data processing that isn't streaming. If I need to load a block from disk before processing it, that's a failure. I should be processing the block as I'm loading it from disk.
I'd also like to get it so I can process the block as it comes down from the network, if it's possible to stream the block in chunks of e.g. 512 transactions, using the merkle root to validate the chunks as you download them.
Edit: I'd like to expand on "load previous outputs in parallel" a little. The idea there is that you should be able to buy 2, 4, 8 hard drives and be able to load previous output scripts from disk at close to 2, 4, 8 times the speed you could previously. It's a lot easier to buy 10 disks than it is to make a single disk 10x faster.
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:52:43
You don't actually have to start over or stop anything when you're mining. You can constantly calculate new work to give to your miners, but that can happen in parallel and at no point will you not be mining.

@_date: 2014-02-22 14:32:49
Header first sync should help with this, once implemented. You don't need to download any block data outside the headers in order to verify the proof of work and longest chain.
Headers are only 80 bytes, so you'd barely need to download any data from alternate chains before discarding them. It'd be a tiny enough amount of data that checkpointing could probably be discarded.
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:17:03
I haven't had a chance to read the topic he tweeted yet, but yes, I believe the idea is that you would only have to request the gaps of data that you are missing. It wouldn't be anything specific to miners either, it would just be the way blocks are communicated by all nodes on the network.
The cleverness would be in how you figure out what the gaps in the data are. The merkle root already lets you verify that you have the right transactions in the right order. The issue is that if the merkle root doesn't match, that gives you absolutely no insight into which transactions you are missing or have in the wrong order.

When you make a purchase from your USD denominated wallet, whatever you're buying is probably going to be priced in USD, with the bitcoin amount calculated based on the current exchange rate. That's the same rate at which you're about to exchange your USD denominated bitcoin in order to make the purchase, so it comes out the same.
If bitcoin goes up in value, yes, you'll lose out on that. That's the price you have to pay to have a pool of bitcoin that suffers no volatility risk.
If your rent is due in a week and you just received your bitcoin paycheque today, you may want to keep your rent money in the USD denominated wallet for that week.

Re: the 10 seconds per block, there could be a bit of leeway there. If you just want to validate transactions that you're receiving, you could probably get away with taking longer to validate the latest block. It would be a decrease in your security, but you'd still have the security of a fully validating node, if you wanted that.
Miners would always want blocks to be validated as quickly as possible, but that's a handy service that pools can compete on.
You can also lock in your local view of the longest chain with just the block header, which will propagate across the network very quickly. It should be an exceptionally rare occurrence that you find a block is actually invalid during validation, since the header still has to be mined either way.
Edit: It just occurred to me that you could also combine the two for mining. You could use a pool to be enable mining on the latest block as quickly as possible, while still fully validating locally at a more relaxed pace.

I think it's best to step back and look at what problem chargebacks solve.
Let's say you pay for a coffee with a $5 bill and you don't like the coffee, or there is some other issue. Is giving everyone the ability to make $5 bills they spend reappear back in their hands the best way to solve this problem?
I imagine there are a variety of scenarios where chargebacks solve some problem. Those problems can be looked at from the perspective of bitcoin and be solved in a bitcoin compatible manner. I think those solutions will be better than chargebacks for everything.

Good point on the mobile. Have you looked at doing anything with Mono and portable class libraries?
That would let people write a single codebase with NBitcoin that works on Windows, Windows Phone, Mac OS, iOS, Linux, and Android. With Xamarin, each platform would get its own native UI, even though you're staying in dotnet. Not too shabby. :) XBox will probably be on that list at some point too.

I'm using extensible storage engine, it's built-in to windows. Everything is behind interfaces so a non-windows platform could implement something else.
I'm directly using a few hundred megs of memory, but the storage engine uses an additional 3+ gigs of ram as cache (I have 16GB total ram on my system). At some point I'll have to time it with the cache limited, currently I'm just letting it use as much as it likes.

It's certainly possible, but one of the things that amazes me about bitcoin is just how well designed the protocol is. It's possible that the blockchain proof-of-work technology could have been invented while also neglecting to take care of all the important details like pruning, etc.
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:43:05
Something I've been wondering about scrypt... shouldn't it lead to more centralization than sha? If it requires gobs of ram for ASICs, then wouldn't only the largest players be able to afford the initial capital outlay required to scrypt mine?

I don't have any technical expertise on IBLT, it looks like understands it far better than I do. The main thing to keep in mind is that all of this will be a separate step that happens before blocks are validated.
During the IBLT phase you will be doing validation like "do I have all the transactions that make up this block yet?". That's a wholly different process from validating the block itself, however, which remains unchanged from today.
@_date: 2014-08-16 13:15:05
I hear what you're saying on developer resources, it's definitely not my intent to pull away from the core pool. I don't think there's much danger of that happening.
For myself, the idea of working in C++ is a real turn off (not meant to be flamewar material, just personal preference), so I wouldn't be working on the reference software anyway.
I do think that alternative implementations will eventually be required. I don't think it'd be a particularly good idea to actually try powering the network with them today, however.
Once we get to global scale, years from now, a single implementation would be a disaster waiting to happen. It'd be like having a single piece of software being responsible for infrastructure across the entire internet.
I don't know if my work can eventually be a part of that future, but I'd like to at least try. :)
Getting from here to there is tricky, however, and fraught with all the perils you've mentioned. I've very intentionally held off any validation code for this reason... I really don't want people thinking they should be using this software for anything real right now.  I also don't have any releases, step 1 is to download the free version of visual studio.
There are lots of mitigation strategies, fortunately. mentioned a good one where you simply compare the tip of the chain across implementations to see if any disagree with bitcoind, and you take bitcoind as canonical.
Far into the future I imagine there'll be several implementations, and server operators will run all of them in a consensus fashion. They'll receive warnings and act accordingly when one or more disagree. In theory, with good test suites, we should be able to get to a point where this just never happens.

You already have the solution with pruning, which you mentioned. Unless you're an archival node, the UTXO is all you need for normal operations.

Is there any reason to use a 24-hour period in the calculation? If the cost is the block reward + tx fee, then you can figure out the transaction cost for every block.
That would mean that transaction costs could vary wildly from a few dollars to thousands of dollars each, depending on how many transactions were in a given block. From that you could still figure out the average transaction cost per 24-hour period, if you wanted to smooth out the data.
Looking at it that way, I'm not convinced block reward + tx fee is a good measure of transaction cost.

Until we have alternate clients I see the software as a point of centralization in bitcoin.
In the linked thread above, Mike Hearn says: "Of course in a normal software environment the protocol would be defined by some specification documents, test suites would be produced to check compliance, etc."
These are the things that I think will need to happen in the future when/if bitcoin really starts to take off. Test suites could be posted online that any alternate implementation could easily run against. There could also be multiple parties publishing test suites.
These things help to reduce the trust I need to place in single parties. Any malicious party would quickly be spotted, and with many alternate implementations the number of people affected will be reduced.
Edit: I just wanted to add that I think future clients will also need to mitigate against forking bugs by monitoring for chain splits. If all of the sudden what you see as the valid blockchain is no longer recognized by the majority of the pool, something is probably up.

It's mostly a bandwidth problem. If you imagine one transaction (at 250 bytes) per person (at 10 billion people) per day, then you have 2.5TB of new data coming in every single day. Having a network connection and storage fast enough to handle that volume of data is an issue. You would also need a significant amount of RAM.
I'm not sure what the CPU requirements are at that volume, but I don't think it'd be that crazy relative to the storage and network requirements.

A good example of off-chain would be Coinbase customers sending each other bitcoin. Coinbase doesn't need to bother storing that on the blockchain, it can just update its internal data on how much bitcoin each customer has at Coinbase. A transaction only needs to be put on the blockchain when the customer withdraws bitcoin.
The current client can actually operate a lot faster. I've been working on a C# node and it can download the current blockchain in under an hour; it's a matter of optimization. Even then, in the future most people won't be interacting with the full blockchain directly, they'll probably use wallet services.

Here's an initial screenshot, this UI is just to support the development work. I've included a simple block navigator to try out some very basic data visualization.

If those 10 people all spend at the same time, the merchant will see the double spend transactions go out over the network immediately, without needing to wait for a block. I'm not sure if the software currently monitors for this, if not I assume that'll get added at some point.
If you don't want to broadcast your double spend transactions, I think your only other option is to collude with a miner to try and include your double spend transaction directly.
@_date: 2013-08-31 13:03:24
You are right that a malicious party would still have to find a nonce which matches the current difficulty.
This doesn't actually guarantee the veracity of the block, but a malicious party can no longer easily lie to you. If they want to lie to you, they still have to spend a similar amount of computing power as the entire bitcoin mining network has.
The individual blocks are actually perfectly valid, the attack is that a malicious party is serving up an alternate history of valid blocks that no one else recognizes.

I mixed up clients &amp; miners while I was thinking about this, sorry about that. Yes, I am a software developer. I glossed over the making of test suites like it's nothing, but I'm assuming a future where there's ample money for these standards bodies kinds of things to come about.
I think it would be best to stop mining when you detect that you're no longer mining on the main blockchain. At worst you would be missing out on revenue, and maybe damages if you had a service contract with someone to process transactions for them. Let me know if I've missed something here.
Also, I don't think that any transactions a miner with a bug processes would be lost. The rest of the network won't see them on the main blockchain and should pick them up in another block.
I see alternates as pretty much inevitable anyway. A $100M mining operation that can write a proprietary miner with a slight efficiency edge will have a competitive advantage. People in other countries may not want to trust software written elsewhere. Etc.
I also think about how much damage a rogue developer could do in a "fuck it" situation. You could post a release that steals wallets. It would be caught almost immediately I'm sure, but how many could you make away with in the meantime? Things like this can of course be mitigated, but now I have to trust that you've done that properly instead.
I think alternate miners are going to happen and bitcoin will have to learn to deal with the kind of issues that it will bring.

Good point. One good thing about that is that I think the time for transactions to spread would be fairly constant, while the block time can be quite variable. That way you can still be fairly confident you'll have had time to detect a double spend, without waiting for a first confirmation which could potentially take quite a bit of time.
