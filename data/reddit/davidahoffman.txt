If bitcoin is only 18.3k in Jan I will be disappointed

We except Vitalik is not irreplaceable. There are plenty of people on the ethereum development team that would be ready to step up to the challenge. Vitalik isn't a lone ranger here. He's just the guy that thought of the idea. Ethereum is much more decentralized than you're giving it credit for

@_date: 2017-12-27 18:04:35
You are making the most far fetched scenarios to drive this point home. They're certainly possible, but far from real threats. 
And again, Vitalik doesn't have this magic controlling stick over Etheruem. He doesn't get to just snap his fingers. Ethereum is controlled by the miners who will get to decide what direction ethereum goes in. The changes Vitalik makes are readily accepted by the miners because the miners know that the changes are beneficial. If they weren't beneficial, and they were more nefarious from some crazy example like you've given, they wouldn't allow it.

Benevolent, tho

It's worth noting that Bitcoin cash bcash started at 300$ and ended at 1300$ when it was all said and done. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:48:04
like, look at this dude
c'mon. you dont have to hop on the train but give credit where credit is due. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:29:44
It doesn't take much to realize Vitalik is in it for the right reasons. Plus it's not like he owns 51% of hashing power. A dictator isn't even the right words. He is the lead developer that has organically garnered support via his actions.

Delete the post OP, This guy already knew this info

It's just worth considering when we're talking about adopting new tech that has to do with money. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:05:36
We have to take into account that Bitcoin is attempting to become MONEY. this is going to happen at a different rate than YouTube or cellphones, simply due to the different domains that's the new tech lives in. We haven't had a change in what money is for 100 years, and even then, it was still paper that represents gold. 
A more accurate graph could compare the change from gold, to paper gold, and then paper gold to fiat, and then fiat to credit cards, and then credit cards to online integers. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:18:58
Yes and credit cards represent a new piece of financial tech that was initially a niche method of paying for things as was often laughed out the door until it wasn't.

We should probably wait for Lightning to have more success before we cheer on circumventing fees. 
May I remind everyone that fee's were $50+ when the network was as utilized as we want it to be...
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:57:10
I’m sure there’s a percentage of that but wether is 90% or 10% we just don’t know 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:03:51
Minimal on terms of $ value or % of the total bit?

Topics include: 
- How to make passive income with the Lightning Network
- How the Lightning Network reflects double-entry bookkeeping.
- The interaction with Lightning Network and the Bitcoin blockchain
- The fee market
- Reasons to create or shutdown a channel
- Current experiments underway to measure the average interest rate to Channel creators.

Yeah, bitcoin has crashed like 4 times. Recovered every time, sure, but no one likes a crash
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:31:00
It's like a manic episode before a crash. It's been going up 100$ every 10 minutes. That is not sustainable. Look at all of Bitcoins previous crashes. Huge massive run up, followed by an almost vertical climb, followed by a massive crash that took 1-3 years to recover from. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:36:36
Yes that’s exactly what this is. I️ used his same metaphor earlier today. Bitcoin is king just because he is on top, not by any law or holy appointment. He can be dethroned by any competent force if that force is strong enough. To assume otherwise is to not understand market forces. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:00:04
More info on this please. Do we know anything about this guy?

As the BCH volume falls lower and lower, BTC will rise. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:22:47
No it's not. Stop pretending it is. You can't use something that takes hours to complete and has 20-50$ fees as cash. You would never do that. Litecoin or BCH is cash. BCH is pretty shitty cash, I prefer litecoin. 
Bitcoin is storage of value. That's all it is, and all it needs to be.

Yes I definitely agree with that. Still. Crashes are bad publicity. One of everyone's chief complaints of BTC is it's volatility. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:12:33
This guy spelled hold correctly so you know you can listen to him. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:22:23
I was referring to trading volume, however. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:21:23
This is not healthy. This is unsustainable. Bitcoin is parabolic right now. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 16:41:49
And it made it's way into the Crypto-twitter sphere. Everyone in crypto twitter retweeted it. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:25:03
I did get some bugs where clicking on the "add bags" button didn't do anything. After doing something else and attempting it again a few minutes later it worked. 
There are certainly some kinks that need to be worked out. Let me know if you want me to try and replicate it. 
Also, for my Altcoins that are paired to ETH or BTC, there is no $$ value indicator :(. I think all panels should have the option to include a USD value even if it's like a LTC BTC pair
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:07:25
Just bought after 2 seconds of looking at it. Have been looking for so long for something like this. Great product. Happy so far.
Please add SpankChain!
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:53:40
The gains are also proportional. So it counts 
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:05:42
Good idea! Which yard is it? Are we neighbors?
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:23:42
But what about DAI, if it was bought when Bitcoin was at $20k...
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:48:36
There HAS to be miners for the bitcoin network. When bitcoin becomes unprofitable for some miners, they turn off. But this makes easier for other miners to mine blocks, and makes it more profitable for them. At some point, some equilibrium is achieved where the most efficient facilities are still profitable and earn the lions share of Bitcoin block rewards
