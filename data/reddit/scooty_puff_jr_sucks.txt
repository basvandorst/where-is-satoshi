Maximization of utility and ubiquity. Until then it will be a roller coaster ride. Assuming the utility and ease of use can keep up with the growth, and can reach mainstream use before another alt-coin unseats it, then it will level out and become viable as a currency as people become more comfortable transacting with it in their day to day lives.
Bear in mind that if someone lives in America, they don't typically monitor how their dollar compares to other currencies, and prices for goods and services don't constantly change as a result of swings in these currency pairs. 
The same way people want dollars in America, Pounds in Great Britain, and Yuan in China, will someday be how people want Bitcoin. When simply having it, regardless of its value in relation to other fiats is more important, because it's necessary to transact for goods and services that one needs, then it will behave more like a currency. This is harder to accomplish than I'm making it sound.

That isn’t really relevant to the question. Fiat currencies can not stop decreasing in value, and people that hold fiat aren’t typically converting other assets into more of it to make money, they receive it as a form of payment for goods, services, labor, etc. People who buy Bitcoin purely to make money are like Forex traders. If I was trading GBP/USD and that became incredibly flat, I’d move into something else, as other currency pairs that are more volitile represent an opportunity cost otherwise.
