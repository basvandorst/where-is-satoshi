bitfloor support actually replied to you?
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:00:42
so can I trace where the bitcoins I purchased from bitfloor are? I dont' have an address or hash or block height, all I have is a match id.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:22:39
what kind of lawsuit could people have filed? isnt there no legal structure behind bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:04:48
When Bitfloor shutdown, Roman (founder of Bitfloor) kept all the bitcoins for himself that were left in accounts. My account still says 10 bitcoins and Roman refuses to communicate with users and  has not returned more than $500K worth of bitcoins since April 2013.
@_date: 2014-02-15 07:32:25
You guys are lucky. At least you know where MtGox is located. My bitcoins are still stuck on Bitfloor and I have no idea where Roman or Bitfloor is located!!! Note: Bitfloor shutdown in April 2013 and although people were refunded their USD, bitcoins were never returned back, some 10,000 BTC. If anyone know where Roman is, please let me know, he is scum of the earth.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:16:12
how do you trace the coins? also, who knows how to trace the coins?
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:13:05
bitcoins were never returned from bitfloor. at least $500K

how am i a troll? roman stole bitfloor user's bitcoins, there are several other people in the same boat as me. I am just trying to bring awareness to our situation since majority of bitcoin redditors did not pay attention to our story and it has been an uphill fight for us with little advice or help. roman won't reply to any of our requests for information. so please tell me how my story is flawed and how I am a troll.
there are similarities between the mtgox and bitfloor situations. so if someone actually has any insight for the mtgox situation, it may also help us bitfloor users who roman blatantly robbed.

?why would it be an easy win in the US?  isnt there no legal structure behind bitcoin?

Roman of Bitfloor stole $500K worth of bitcoins and he is still alive.

@_date: 2014-02-10 07:48:45
no one knows. no response from roman or bitfloor support. there is not much we can do either. im guessing roman just used the bitcoins for himself since there was no hack, just a shutdown.
@_date: 2013-10-17 05:03:43
Thanks for the advice. Do you have any idea why Roman won't alllow people to transfer their bitcoins or at least give us a response?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:51:56
NO ONE has been able to receive BTC refund since a few days after Bitfloor shutdown. The user OMGnohedidnt has taken initiative and been organizing other poeple, so you should send him a message . 
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:17:30
yes bitfloor was previously hacked but the shutdown had nothing to do with any hack. so the question we all have is, why can't we get our bitcoins back? they should still be there. the only reason we would not get them back is if roman decided to keep them for himself.
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:45:24
or could also post in a legal advice subreddit
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:55:20
The number is a google voice number
@_date: 2013-11-08 05:03:23
audenx, do you know what is the best way to approach the situation is? should we hire a lawyer? are you able to get in contact with roman or his lawyer?
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:06:56
has New York Department of Financial Services/Fraud replied to any of the complaints?
I'm part of the group that is fighting to get my BTC returned from Bitfloor, so I am in somewhat of a different boat than you but still fighting the same enemy.
has anyone tried to confront roman? where in ny does he live? where is his business?
@_date: 2013-11-13 07:31:25
Yea that;s what i was thinking and heard earlier. it sucks that he basically "stole" them though.
@_date: 2013-11-08 04:57:20
The fact that he has been unresponsive in regards to BTC probably means nothing is happening compared to when he actually talked to audenx about $ refunds.
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:24:19
bitfloor shut down themselves, most likely from the pressure of govt or banks. they refunded most of USD in accounts but btc in accounts has not been returned. bitfloor has been extremely mum. they said they would return USD, which for the most part did, but took 6+ months. in regards to btc, no communication whatsoever
@_date: 2013-10-04 06:26:50
why can't they just allow me to transfer them? So you're saying Roman/Bitfloor "stole" my bitcoins? I understand the previous times when bitfloor got hacked that they really couldn't do anything about it, but this time they were shutdown and the bitcoins should still be there.
@_date: 2013-10-17 07:33:53
Thanks man much appreciated. Will try it out and see how it goes.
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:40:53
Yes please! Thanks for taking the initiative. Please let me know how it goes.
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:43:41
What do you plan on doing next? I'm also in your shoes and I think there are several other people as well. Many people suggest talking to a lawyer. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:48:08
i'm sick of people saying that there was a window of opportunity and that you should've gotten your bitcoins then. yea there was a window of opportunity for a few days right after bitfloor shutdown. but not everyone was aware of the situation. in addition, that was nothing to do with the fact that bitfloor has not returned bitcoins. what difference does it make returning allowing withdraw of bitcoins then and now, it shoul dbe the same and bitfloor should return them. so stop saying there was a window of opportunity because everyone already knows that.
@_date: 2013-10-17 05:46:05
sounds good but there is no contact information for bitfloor or Roman
@_date: 2013-10-14 03:26:33
i would also like to know!!!!
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:29:23
lets make this clear. The BTC not returned to users is not theft by hackers, but theft by Roman himself.
@_date: 2013-10-17 16:04:52
Man that sucks. Do you have any idea how to proceed to deal with the situation?
@_date: 2013-10-18 04:53:32
da hell is labcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-17 05:46:49
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:05:12
but why was he able to release a statement in regards to refunding USD and not BTC? i dont think i would give him the benefit of the doubt at this point
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:57:02
I suggest posting in a legal advice subreddit and maybe someone will help. I have already done so.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:11:42
what do you mean when you say "The New York Department of Financial Services/Fraud and the police are beginning to take notice "? 
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:21:41
why would he not process refunds now?
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:09:10
no word. one reddit user is taking initiative to find an attorney to take the case but I think it's taking a while.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:12:06
hey, as madman6000 stated earlier, the option to withdraw bitcoins is no longer available and has completely disappeared. truly sad, i don't know what this means. btw did you get my pm?
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:53:24
in April 2013, bitfloor shutdown its operations. Bitfloor was not hacked and no bitcoins were stolen. However, those that had bitcoins in their bitfloor accounts that did not withdraw/transfer within 1-3 days of shutdown have not been able to move their bitcoins from their accounts.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:33:15
bitfloor has not returned btc
@_date: 2013-10-17 04:54:38
because I read somewhere that bitfloor is not liable or something like that.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:44:45
yea its unfortunate. i have had no luck trying to contact bitfloor/roman and i believe no one else has had any luck either.
@_date: 2013-10-19 21:25:55
I wonder if anyone has attempted to sue him. I would also like the bitcoin community on reddit to be more helpful towards us. It seems as if everyone just swept this under the rug.
