This. Transactions are never safe before being committed to a block and no one should be propagating any illusion that they are. Whether is through Peter's patch or someone else's pools have the right and ought to select variants of transactions for their fees.

Pulseaudio kinda ruined Linux. Find a BSD or linux distro which still relies on OSS. A lot of sound pros end up using Free/Net/OpenBSD without knowing it because they plug their machines into "mixers" running one of these three beautiful systems. While the systemd parasite broke Linux sound with pulse audio the Unix sound stack performs more beautifully than ever.

That article suggests [v0.5.4-TEST2 release candidate]( but what you really just really want to do is raise your minimum relay transaction fee, though bouncing other junk out before it hits your mempool like unconfirmed transaction chains can help as that is what a lot of the spam was before. Pseudonodes make the spam problem worse though because they will relay any bullshit, and for some reason there are a lot of those on the network.

Just because you can't accept the way the world must work doesn't mean that reality can change to suit your expectations or your fee-fees. Bitcoin is increasingly successful because of the security it offers. If you start subtracting parts like verafiability down to the genesis block you start eroding those guarantees and end up with something shittier... like MasterCard.

I use OpenBSD. Seems to get more auditing and the devs take quality random very seriously. Building Bitcoin against LibreSSL also syncs the whole blockchain *so far*
@_date: 2015-07-07 00:20:06
Pretty much. Except some people's "attack" might just be someone else's use case. Either way larger blocks mean it costs less to bloat the chain more.

No. You should hold then until you have a very good understanding of the Bitcoin ecosystem and can make informed decisions. A year or two should be long enough. Otherwise simply having bitcoins should be investment enough.

It is necessary for every transaction committed to a block to be verifiable. This inherently will limit transaction rates, but if you can't verify the entire history of transactions in the system your system is not Bitcoin.

If the fork is triggered XTCoin will be distinct from "Bitcoin Classic" and if it looks like this fork might actually get triggered you can bet your ass that people will be making exchanges for trading coins on one chain for coins on the other.

There are perfectly good reasons to validate everything. It keeps everyone honest. I makes sure your bitcoin implementation follows the same rules as everyone else's. We actually *don't* assume the most difficult chain is legit or else BIP66 would have become irrelevant the moment the softfork chains were longer and more difficult.
*Complete* validation is critical in a consensus system.

I don't know what alternate reality could case this kind of understanding. Bitcoin was stolen from Android wallets because of insufficiently random -k values.

Seriously for each ECDSA Bitcoin keypair every signing after the first you risk broadcasting with a random nonce -k which if insufficiently random allows solving the private key.
