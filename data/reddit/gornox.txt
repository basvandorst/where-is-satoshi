Without confirmations? Damn Gox...
EDIT: Got the coins finally some time ago, took between 1,5-2 hours.

Yeah. I was thinking that maybe it works better to Japanese bank account. Wondering now how I could get hold of one =P

Is it stupid to use a service like  if they have 60 day waiting period before I can take my Bitcoins out? They say that this is because of PayPal and their policies of people being able to file a complaint and get their money back. They say without this people could exploit the system and have both the Bitcoin drawn out of the account and money trough a PayPal draw back.
EDIT: See [this screenshot]( I took from their site.

Thanks! I've been reading about these issues for the past hour now. Will check these topics too ^^ ^^

Are you kidding me? What the heck is wrong with your answers? Worst Q&amp;"A" I've ever seen.

Hey, one small question. What do you mean by "nearly impossible"? They say that wire transfer should take up to 2 weeks.

Just found 
Freaking perfect. (Annoying how I just lost 10 euros by not remembering my Linkedin account details for maybe 5-10 minutes.)
EDIT: No, looks like their conversion rate is just that much worse than with Bitstamp. Still worth it since I don't need to wait for 24hours + (I think)

Finally got it. I have no idea where the confirmations were shown if anywhere. Weird... Thanks for the practical help!
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:08:36
Thank you. Will consider trading back if I get this sorted!

That's part of the link on my e-mail from BTC-e. I'll check into this to find out if it's somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:09:29
Meh. I'll just go deposit for that Bitstamp so my money is still useable if really needed. Good decision?
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:00:52
I think it's this one found on BTC-e: 
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:38:35
They should. If there's any way to open one without going to Japan in person I'm definitely gonna try to do that. If it's not possible maybe I really should go to Japan and open one for some kind of Bitcoin business purpose. (Quite far fetched but could at least research on that.)

I wanted to cash out and quit this damn thing after failing a trade really bad. 
(Bought these 1.2 BTC for 630 just before it went down to 540 &gt;_&lt;)
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:06:21
Ah! Sorry about that. This one any better? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:11:38
Shit. I just made a puss out to Gox because everything else started to fall... I have no idea what I should do with these dollars now!
