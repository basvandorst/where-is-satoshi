write down the seed on paper. cut piece of paper in half and store one half in safe deposit box. keep the other half and make multiple copies. easy peasy multisig.

no they use a single mid market rate

If they add a TREZOR card then they'll be unstoppable!
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:51:54
Like this you mean?

so currently theres a bunch of cards denominated in different currencys. One of those cards is bitcoin. All the funds need to be managed by bitreserve apart from the bitcoin one. So there could be a TREZOR card which looked like all the others but the private key was controlled by the user not bitreserve.

Yes I can confirm it is there right next to shepherd faireys mural on ebor street. I walked past it today.

Telebit.org means all Telegram users have a built in bitcoin wallet.

the uk robocoin only accepts people with driving licences whats that about?
@_date: 2014-08-06 22:01:18
I run the satoshipoint.co.uk machines and none of them have AML KYC ID checks turned on it is simply cash in or out simple 
@_date: 2014-11-28 09:43:15
not to begin with but the software for cashouts is already written. hopefully we can get them working at the beginning of next year.

I think whatsapp has recently proven its value, but imagine if it was as easy to send money as it is to send messages. If you could just type in $10 a message and it gets sent that would be amazing. there is an open source version of whatsapp called  and I think it would be amazing if someone combined it with a wallet such as kncwallet.com

updated article from coindesk:  
@_date: 2015-05-25 16:17:01
Can we not just up transaction fees as a temporary fix to limit the number of transactions?
@_date: 2014-09-10 13:43:02
yes it is 5% not 7%, the article is wrong
@_date: 2014-10-31 17:43:59
these pos terminals will create bitcoin adoption by stealth, I like it alot. sexy machine aswell.
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:08:24
Could be worth it now that Apples allowing mobile bitcoin apps
@_date: 2016-03-17 05:16:38
plus you can only deposit btc to their dubai vault and not redeem gold if bought with btc making it non fungible
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:35:14
you're not listening nobby, you can only withdraw from bitreserve in BTC. AML kicks in after $1000 in transfers
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:01:52
KNCwallet does this but it is areal bitcoin wallet where you control the private keys. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:05:24
bitusd is created from a contract on bitshares that backs the bitusd with 300% in reserves of Bitshares in a decentralised contract. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:06:42
tell me more
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:14:43
i agree the decentalised ones like bitusd and nubits look sketchy for now, but they show the most promise for the future i think.
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:13:15
They don't for now but it's coming. The hold dollars in reserves but you can only withdraw dollar value in btc.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:52:49
@_date: 2016-03-09 13:21:27
Telebit.org have a well established bitcoin wallet already.

thats not the northern quarter

run a full node in your browser?

The frictionless movement of money is easy.  
AML/KYC regs create the friction.
Cash is a bearer asset. Digital fiat should be to.
@_date: 2016-12-13 15:41:25
anyone buy startcoin?
@_date: 2016-12-09 14:09:13
bitshares is the best decentralised exchange in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:15:32
it will become slightly easier to mine bitcoin

Video tutorials on how to use the app can be found here:  
@_date: 2015-08-13 13:51:45
you'll need to give the app permission. heres how: 
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:51:50
you could say that about any unit of value. 1 btc is a whole bitcoin and a troy ounce is commonly trades and quoted amount
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:46:30
i know, it's just interesting
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:39:05
Bitcoin cash hard fork will adjust difficulty level meaning miners will start mining Bcash and bitcoin mempool will get more backlogged

coinbase haven't release bcash yet
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:56:57

or, 1 Bitcoin will buy you 7 troy ounces of platinum
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:18:56
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:51:28
this is why we need a decentralised USD proxy token. Uphold freezes accounts. USDT is centralised. BitUSD on BitShares is the best we have so far.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:40:41
Are segwit transactions enabled from the GUI yet?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:30:23
Things you can do to defend this attack on bitcoin. 1.) Sell BCash and buy BTC 2.)Direct mining power to bitcoin even at a loss, 3.) don't do any transactions this week. The fun starts at 7pm UTC
@_date: 2015-07-07 20:49:51
up the bitcoin transaction fees I say
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:44:43
No, 1 troy ounce is worth 15% of a Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:18:16
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:42:01
Telegram already has a fully feature tipping bot called Telebit see telebit.org

Does this make factom redundant?

see telebit.org for a demo of how to send bitcoin through telegram
@_date: 2015-04-28 14:48:34
If you use telegram then you already have a bitcoin wallet  
@_date: 2015-09-11 02:22:46
Yes, that is what it does
@_date: 2015-04-20 16:38:02
You can already easily send bitcoin easily through Telegram with no registration process. see

Telegram users can take advantage of a built in wallet from 
@_date: 2015-04-20 16:49:38
Telebit.org is great because because all 50 million users can start using it this instant. you just search for  and then message it "WALLET" as if it was one of your contacts. So simple and works on every platform telegram does with nothing extra to install.
@_date: 2016-10-22 09:43:07
They need to add gold 
@_date: 2015-09-29 06:49:49
I've been trying to think of something similar myself. 
I thought of livestreaming myself walking around London and handing out £10 notes to homeless in realtime, bitcoiners could send money to me to pay for it and see their money go directly to someone live.
@_date: 2015-11-23 03:32:53
this is why decentralised exchanges like bitshares are needed asap
@_date: 2015-11-23 15:07:53
it's just a normal projector connected to a laptop via hdmi.
@_date: 2015-10-14 12:18:26
They mention a digital currency in their video called VOX coin. Anyone know what this is about?
@_date: 2015-10-05 22:59:38
you should try the telegram btc wallet bot called telebit
@_date: 2015-11-29 13:25:34
bitshares already is a truly decentralised exchange
@_date: 2015-10-14 12:17:21
Yeah I wanna know what this VOX coin is too?
@_date: 2015-10-16 15:38:47
