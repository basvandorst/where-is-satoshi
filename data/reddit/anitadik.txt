Uhm. Wow.

Lay off the reefers. They make you paranoid. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:30:44
Enjoy the downvotes instead.

Where is Bitcoin mentioned in the article? I can't find it.

Maybe a change in the sign up process where people who don't verify their email still get counted as new members or spam bots getting through the registration. It's too sudden. This implies a change and not an increase in interest in the forum. 
Edit: the day before there were no new sign ups so i guess he worked on the change there.

I seriously can't keep up with all these companies dissapearing anymore. Does this have anything to do with okcoin or something?

Ah, so now it's a conspiracy of course. 
First you deny it till the facts hit you in the face so then you just call it a hoax. 
Also funny how you blindly believe everything that is posted on the highly biased site FreeRoss. But that fits your agenda of course. 
Your critical thinking only applies when you don't like certain facts. 
You look more desperate with every reply. I suggest stepping away from the keyboard a bit.

The app part really made me think. 6 years and indeed an useless app can get 10 times more users in a week. This says a lot about Bitcoin. It says people simply aren't interested. The harsh reality. 
Edit: truly amazing. After i made this comment people are going through my comment history to also downvote my other comments. That's how angry they are at me for saying this. I bet if i my address was known i'd be in danger. 
This place is crazy.

I have no idea why you are being downvoted. I've seen thread after thread here with massive support for Ross. Not saying that is a bad thing but why this suddenly gets denied is beyond me. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:25:36
Sometimes it's good to admit things you don't like instead of coming up with ridiculous comparisons. I also want Bitcoin to succeed. Believe me. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:35:23
So why didn't you do this in Bitcoin then?
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:28:57
Lose. Her vagina is so loose that i might lose my cock in there. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 20:08:31
Ah right. Well apparently something changed after that and my guess is the sign up process.

What part about what YOU just posted don't you understand exactly?
Of the six murder indictments trumpeted by the U.S. government in the days following Ulbricht’s Oct. 2013 arrest, five have fallen off the table and the sixth sits untouched in a separate indictment (legalese for an unproven allegation) that was purposefully left out of the upcoming trial.
Yes, it's purposefully left out of this trial because he is being charged with it at the next trial in Maryland, as has been explained here about 120 times. 
So no, not all charges have been dropped, as you just posted yourself. How dumb can you get. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:23:34
You're talking to the wrong person. You didn't have to find anything for me. Talk to the other guy. And seeing how he was right in the first place and you were wrong i doubt he cares much. 
I'm just pointing out your dumbass contradiction:
"All charges have been dropped" and then you post yourself that not all charges have been dropped. Kinda hilarious don't you think?
It's been known for many months he will be charged with the murder for hire thing at the next trial in Maryland. Everyone seems to understand this by now except for the usual group of Ross supporters. I wonder why.

Killing someone is less wrong? Seriously? One of the hits he also paid to have 3 innocent people killed because they happened to be in the way. He ordered hit after hit as if he was ordering fries at macd's.

The Chinese only use Bitcoin to trade. Or more specific to pump and dump. No big loss. Also nowhere near 80%. Their exchanges don't charge fees. All you see is bots selling to their own accounts and back. The numbers are inflated by a factor 4 if i remember correctly. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 16:26:32
I've seen that argument used a lot here. 
None of us is denying that governments can be corrupt as hell.
