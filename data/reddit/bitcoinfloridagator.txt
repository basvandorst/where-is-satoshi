Good morning Bitcoiners:
Bitcoin is down, just slowly consolidating a pattern of higher lows in an ascending Triangle since 12/15 to the 4200 level. I’m buying more as we hit that line of rising support, That is still going higher over time while the 200 day goes lower over time.  Meaning we are going to break out if this keeps happening. 
When I see a pullback, it’s a btfd gift for the last 3 months and will continue to be. I think of this song I made in December on every pullback:
many bears, many many many many bears, wish death on bitcoin.
Lord I don’t cry no more, I just look to buy some more, have mercy on me!
Have mercy on my soul, so when Bitcoin is Gold, don’t come begging to me! -Bitty Cent Remix, now lets win this market Bulls!
@_date: 2019-03-25 17:05:52
That’s what makes a market.
@_date: 2019-03-16 20:56:50
I like this PD!
@_date: 2019-03-08 23:11:33
REMEMBER in this 2% pussy pullback:
Especially DYIdude2!
It’s ok if Bitcoin’s grinding,
It just means more time to be buying,
You know the shorts are unwinding,
When you see the higher lows are climbing. GRINDING!

200 week MA is the line I bought in on 12/15/18, it’s the bull line in the sand, the 200 day is the bears line in the sand, there’s your range and we’re nearing the top of that range again on slow and steady momentum right now

No songs or goofy stuff today. Just going to be talking about Bitcoin breaking out and all the reasons to own it. Let’s see how that plays out with you all.
@_date: 2019-03-09 12:00:48
10 years ago TODAY! I bought the stock market bottom! Apple and some other stocks. I wasn’t a genius, I just reacted to Ben Bernanke doing QE 1.  It’s been a long and enjoyable ride but I can say that it’s now time to pass the torch to BTC!  
12/15/18 Bitcoin that I also bought after waiting out Bitcoin for 13 long months will be greater than 3/9/2009 Stock Bull!
@_date: 2019-03-28 14:09:40
I don’t want to do leverage unless you give me a BTC ETF like GLD that tracks bitcoin one for one so I can buy 100x options on them. I would do out of the money call spreads and roll out the numbers as bitcoin went higher if that makes any sense. I did the same thing from Gold 1000 to 1800 back in 2010/2011.
@_date: 2019-03-31 10:03:01
I would know because I bought the stock market bottom on 3/9/09 and I’m an expert in market psychology where I’ve taught classes on it and this is the bottom on 12/15/18 which I also bought.
@_date: 2019-03-25 13:07:48
That’s partially incorrect only because we don’t know how Central Bankers and Wall Street institutions will respond to a decreased inflation rate,
Although in some ways, there are investors like me, but not many, that are already in Bitcoin for that reason of Halving.
@_date: 2019-03-01 19:54:40
The smart bears, which there are not many of, use stop losses so they know there’s a point where they should throw in the towel
@_date: 2019-03-26 15:57:51
Bollinger bands are tight, when we break 4200 to the upside, it should take us to 5800 in a short amount of time like a month or 2
@_date: 2019-03-09 13:26:09
Is that a song request or a comment? Lol.
@_date: 2019-03-14 13:46:46
I sold 8k less than the bottom but I didn’t feel right with the fact that Bitcoin was on the Big Bang Theory in November 2017 where they were talking about it at 5k because when they taped the show it was 3 months before that release date, then it’s 12k and I’m thinking to myself this is too much of a bubble, the public always buys too late in a rally.
Now I think the bear market that we had has fixed that problem where people aren’t overly bullish and overly optimistic anymore, which makes Contrarian me Overally optimistic and overly bullish
@_date: 2019-03-06 04:34:26
No, I replied to a comment he said that was Retweeted where he said Bitcoin helped him with a project tracking something.
I said “BTC did or BSV?”
He said “Core Did. The delays etc.”
I said “ok then” and was blocked ��

And I swear that Bitcoin is going up, yes Bitcoin is going up���� -Bitcoin Nirvana.... Was that good? :)
@_date: 2019-03-31 11:24:05
I’m glad you pointed that out, it was a prior bottom and a lot of people will be on the sidelines until we break 6k, that’s why I think the predominant buying will be coming from shorts covering up to that level.
Then investors will feel like the water is safe with less shorts inside and they begin to buy at 6k.
@_date: 2019-03-29 21:42:27
You keep saying that till Bitcoin is back at ATHs
@_date: 2019-03-18 07:05:05
Good morning Bulls and a small amount of Bears. I got a $300 buy order in a 3900 and a $200 buy order in at 3850, if we get there.
If we don’t, still happy to sit back and enjoy the plus 4k breakout. ��
@_date: 2019-03-11 01:03:31
You want hilarious?
I started an account on Twitter after buying the bottom where I call myself the 12/15/18 Jesus since Roger Ver abdicated his Bitcoin Jesus Title with his Btrash project.  
And in the Book of Revelations of my Gator Bottom Gospel, Chapter 12 Verse 15 says Bitcoin is going to be 100k in 5 years or less (12/15/23 or before).
I really hope DYIdude2 is reading this lol. Move over where I’m the most bullish person on Reddit now. ;)
@_date: 2019-03-06 18:21:22
As someone who has witnessed the stock market’s longest bull run in history, 10th birthday on Saturday, I think the healthiest thing for bitcoin to do is work its way slowly turning one resistance level into support over time. Like we’re doing here with the 4200 level, then 5800 is the next level and so on, then shorts will have exhausted themselves trying to push us lower and we will melt up with a bitcoin rally made of bricks instead of sand.

It should be worth as much as gold if not more by the 2023 halving where it becomes rarer than it.
@_date: 2019-03-18 23:25:35
Ok, I’ll hold back but if I we get to 3700, I’m buying atleast a half bitcoin more

Well I’ve been doing this for 3 months as of Friday, and so far we’re up 700 or so bucks a bitcoin and at a couple times a 1000, those are good returns in that amount of time

We will break 6k and 3200 has come &amp; gone in the rear view mirror. Positive thoughts!
@_date: 2019-03-28 22:09:13
Only focus since 12/15/18, that’s the bottom and everything changed from sell the rallies to buy the dips: THATS the definition of a bull market.

We’re holding this corridor imo
@_date: 2019-03-03 16:16:56
There will come a time where the stock market crashes as there’s no credibility left in the Fed controlling our debt levels and I have no doubt in my mind that that money will go into deflationary assets where Bitcoin after more halvings will be the most deflationary asset on Earth

On 12/15/18 a Holiday poem:
‘Twas the night Bitcoin bottomed, and all through Twitter, not a single buyer to be found, all went in the Shitter.
But then up in the sky there arose such a Gator,
That saved Bitcoin from the 2000’s 
To the Bears “See ya later!”

Crap Typical Subreddit Bearishness like your comment is what I downvote and so did Bitcoin today and will continue to all year long.
@_date: 2019-03-27 11:50:26
You can still buy back, I’ve heard that same line from Apple traders in 2011,2013, &amp; 2015, and every time the answer was to just buy back and forget what you missed out on.
@_date: 2019-03-11 20:50:10
So the thing about Apple is that I’m so far in the houses money that at this point, I’m just trading around a core position where I did make a little accumulating victory by selling 1/2 at 225 it topped out at 233, and I bought the other half back and then some by getting it for 142 on Christmas Eve.
@_date: 2019-03-21 07:07:55
Can you feel it Bitcoiners? We’re going up in a drifting and believable manner! Shorts slowly being stopped out called a Melt-Up. This is how we want to rally to 4200 and the 200 day, Our chances of breaking those this time are tremendously higher than any other time since 12/15/18
@_date: 2019-03-24 20:43:38
I’m not embarrassed 
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:50:20
But they usually charge you margin on a daily basis, options like what’s in stocks has all the premium for the time of the expiration paid all up front.
That’s the difference.

To your first point, a bear market can have lots of bull market rallies in it like if 2000-3000 was a 50% gain,
I’m saying this is a new paradigm where this bull market will take us back to ATH’s eventually.
To your second point, people will confirm there is a bull market if we get a weekly close over the 200 day which could be at 4200 by the time we grind there since it’s downward sloping. 
I appreciate your perspective I want you and others to know.
@_date: 2019-03-16 07:04:23
Were over 4k on strong volume right now, and that’s because on Bitcoin 3/16 we just whipped the bears ass to quote Stone Cold Steve Austin.
And to quote Bret the Hitman Hart: Bitcoin is the best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be!

Bitcoin, like every other asset that ever lived, has bear markets and bull markets,
Until 12/15/18, it was a one sided fight, and now the buyers are starting to outnumber the sellers.  I am talking purely in technical and psychological terms where your analysis is based on a long term fundamental thesis.  Two different perspectives.

People are using at as 1.3 TRILLION Dollars transaction volume last year, its the Rarest as in the inflation rate will soon be less than the Fed 2% target rate at 1.8% and soon be less than the inflation rate of Gold, Central Banks will be using it as the new reserve currency AND adoption amount users will keep going up! 
But if you constantly rip on Bitcoin, you will just throw out baseless comments like that with no evidence to back you up

Actually I bought 2 bitcoins at 2k Feb 2017 sold at 12k Nov 2017 and owned zero crypto for 13 months.
Actually I bought back in on 12/15/18 with prior profits.
I guess I’m not part of the majority or something? Lol.

Good morning everyone! For realz, someone told me that we’re not in a bull market on Twitter and I replied with a picture of a math book and said:
“Really? Because last time I checked a bull market was any move over 20% and 3150x1.2=3780, are we above that number-yes. Are we in a bull market? YES��”
Anyone want to disagree with that statement? You can say Bitcoin is not like other assets in that respect but my book of technical analysis that I’ve used to risk management says otherwise. We are in a bull market until proven otherwise, the trend is your friend.

Look at the 3/9/2009 stock bull, how many dumps have taken place there and yet it’s been grinding higher for 9.5 years, if we go two steps forward and one step back like that, then the bitcoin  bull will be built on a house of bricks instead of sand.

If you look at the last Bull Run- 160 to 20,000, the potential % run is from 3150 to 393,000.  I do think that’s possible by 2024 following more halvings where then Bitcoin is almost worth as much as gold.
Could we have a 30-40% bear in between then? sure.
Will we have an 80% plus bear before then? I highly doubt it.

You and of lot of other people, this is the wall of worry, it was true in market psychology for stocks coming off the biggest crash since the Great Depression that put everyone in shell shock. It’s true here after an 84% Bear market during which time the hash rate, LN, adoption, and mining fees were all beginning to be addressed and improved on.
This is an epic buying opportunity.

Thank you for bringing up a Wall Street topic that’s right up my alley.
The yield curve will stop inverting and flatten out to then rising because the Fed will go from 2.5% Rates to more QE to kingdom come.  
They cant afford to pay the interest of the debt at this point and our government is just spending like crazy to make the problem harder and harder for the Fed.
This will be a MAJOR catalyst to Bitcoin because that’s why it was made in the first place! To counter Central Bankers ruining fiat.

I think to 320,000 then to 48,000 after 2023-2025 then a bull run to a Million from 48,000 by 2029 or a little after, that bull run will be the one of central bank adoption that I’m talking about with the halvings making Bitcoin new gold.
@_date: 2019-03-01 22:04:20
I sold at 12k! From 2k earlier that year after seeing so much momentum behind it, The main reason was I saw an episode of Bitcoin on the Big Bang Theory and said to myself, ok now every idiot on earth is going to want it and we’re near a top. I missed out on 12k-20k but still I have 3.5-4 bitcoins now for the price of 1 basically with prior profits and some extra savings I’ve had since then.

I was reading you guys during the whole bear market and I had enough of all the cynical BS and decided to come on here to inject some positivity into Reddit, since we are in a bull market and people should be positive about the future both short and long term
@_date: 2019-03-05 14:46:45
You’re looking very short term, you need to think in terms of 5-10 years atleast

@_date: 2019-03-30 02:13:20
Do you say 4400 because it’s the 200 day? and if so, the 200 day downward sloping, so we can break it going sideways

There are no stupid questions, markets are a discounting mechanism for the future,

I want to reiterate something I just said to another Reddit page.
My problem with my country in my view is not I hate Democrats and Republicans.  It’s an I hate the fact that 12 board governors and a Fed Chair making monetary decisions that affect the whole world is not freedom or capitalism.  
The Fed is a monetary version of the Politburo in the U.S.S.R. The media and the 2 party system distracts the vast majority of people with this stupid bs fight of them acting like babies against one another.  
If more people were woke like me to how mathematically if you just looked on the debt clock and saw rising debt and rising money M2 money supply, you would think, I don’t want to own dollars, I’d rather have hard not pos money instead. 
That is why I buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-10 13:33:35
I also have a meme with “Bitty Cent” that’s hardcore rap, 
Here’s how it goes:
Many men, many many many many men wish death on Bitcoin.

Have mercy on me! Have mercy on my soul, so when Bitcoin is Gold. Don’t come begging to me!

@_date: 2019-03-07 18:33:48
Yeah well when Bitcoin is on the Big Bang Theory and they say it’s only going up, the contrarian in me says sell.
On 12/15/18 when I read article after article saying we’re only going down, the contrarian in me says buy.
@_date: 2019-03-25 14:48:53
In no particular order:
1. Market consensus is that we are stagnant and not going to break out meaning a lot of people are either short or not long, that’s bullish.
2. Were not overbought on RSI or MACD compared to the last 2 times we were at 4200, less likely bears will try to scalp because they’ve exhausted themselves, that’s bullish.
3. A lot of negative catalysts are in the rear view mirror or baked into the price. Imo the halving taking Bitcoin from 3.6% to 1.8%- an inflation less than the Fed Funds rate is insanely Bullish and not priced in at all.
4. An extra one to add on, Jerome Powell has no clue how to run the Fed, he predicted 3-4 rate hikes this year last October and said last week no rate hikes at all, I have zero faith in his ability to forecast the economy and that bearish for the Dollar.
@_date: 2019-03-26 14:01:23

Thank you, I’m still kinda pissed I missed out on 12k to 20k because it was 12k when I saw the episode of Bitcoin on the Big Bang Theory &amp; a alarm went off in my contrarian head that the public wants it now so sell everything. But then again I had a lot of profits still to buy back more Bitcoin with in the 3000’s the last 2.5 months :)

I know it, I just hope people can follow my lead while we’re still in accumulation phase that’s about to go into bull market because when you go sideways to up long enough and the 200 day keeps going down, it’s just a matter of time
If anyone on here is waiting for sub 3000 levels to go all in, that’s incredibly foolish, you should put money to work while it starts with a 3, I have 29 times so far since 12/15 and I have a lot of dry powder if in the 1% or less chance I’m wrong and we do see 2,000’s

@_date: 2019-03-05 10:22:32
I don’t think it’s going to dump to 3600 although we do have tremendous support at that level on the charts I see. 
All of the money I’m using to buy bitcoin cane from turning 2 bitcoins in Feb 2017 at 2k each to Nov 2017 at 12k each, 20,000 profit, I’ve used 14,500 of that profit so far to buy 4.1 bitcoins, and I’m willing to bet the farm on the rest of the profits the next time we go over 4200, then I’d have atleast 5.4 Bitcoins with just the houses money from the  2 bitcoins in 2017
And yet 99.9999% of people think I have no idea what I’m talking about on Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2019-03-30 10:34:27

So the difference is that Bitcoin has its footprint so Internationally where it’s globally recognized which makes it real and more special to put faith in than anything people try to hatch up to imitate it.
People may use other crypto to buy things with but as far is new gold store of value, it will be hoarded by those central banks as an alternative to gold, but in my mind a lot better.

The Central Banks will buy those bad actors out with prices in the 6 digits for Bitcoin, so it’s a problem that will solve itself. They will Hodl Bitcoin like Fort Knox and these bad actors won’t want to buy at those high of levels in the future.
Could those bad actors do bad things with their profits? Let’s hope not. Out of our control.

@_date: 2019-03-31 15:26:09
I think this rally will be different, Bitcoin is exposed to the masses after the 2017 bubble that we’re still shell shocked over the crash and before any massive move happens, we have to grind our way through one resistance level at a time before we break 20,000. Then we can go back to normal Bitcoin rally speed.
Look at a 10 year S&amp;P chart wall of worry, that’s what I expect Bitcoin to look like over the next 2 years.
@_date: 2019-03-03 20:57:03
I don’t think we go into full bull mode like 2017 until the next halving, however, I think we can grind higher until then taking out 4200, then 5800, then 7800 etc in a 2 steps forward 1 step back fashion.

In America, there is a two party system of choices of one big government choice vs another, then the media plays it off like a daily battle so that they intentionally distract you from the rising deficit and M2 money supply because if Americans focused on that, we would be united in changing our political economic system for good.

The Stock bull started on 03/09/2009 and ended on 10/3/2018.  We don’t have enough economic growth to push to new highs and the Fed QE infinity is not going to help investors confidence this time, 
That money is going into hard assets and commodities this time around, and it’s going to be painful for those not hedging their savings. 
The only reason I Hodl Apple is because they are a class unto themselves with their Free Cash Flow that their PE Ratio is always a huge discount to the market. And they always return that cash to investors in stock buybacks and increased dividends. 
But now I have an equal amount of Bitcoin, so that shows you how much I believe in Bitcoin.

That would be nice and most of that 20k, like 15k of it, is meant for lowering my average as dry powder if in the rarest chance I’m wrong about the bottom. The other 5k I’m spreading out mostly 500 a week so 10 more weeks of accumulating

3150 times 1.20= 3780, we are in a bull market above that by definition of a bull market being a 20% move off the lows of a move 20% down.
If we revisited that bottom, I got another 6400 dollars of dry powder ready to buy another 2 bitcoins like I did on 12/15.  So it wouldn’t be the worst thing on Earth for me.

I IMMEDIATELY send everything I buy from Binance or Coinbase Pro into my Trezor and don’t take chances.
Fact: after the next halving, Bitcoin inflation rate 1.8% less than the Fed’s target inflation rate, making it a hedge against the US dollar for foreign Central Banks holding Dollar Reserves.
Fact: after the halving in 2023, Bitcoin inflation rate 0.9% where less than Gold inflation, making those same foreign central banks want to buy it as a full fledged replacement to Gold.
Don’t sell until 2 more halvings, atleast not all of your bitcoins.

Because we hit the 200 week moving average that day on a bullish RSI divergence off the capitulation selloff, the mood of Bitcoiners was despair, and then a lightbulb went off in my head that said “Hey, this is like 03/09/09 stock market all over again and since that was the first day I ever bought stocks, then damn sure you bet I’m loading the boat on Bitcoin at 3200
I had 2 bitcoins from feb 2017 to Nov 2017 from 2k to 12k Sold and waited for that moment.
Now this 12/15/18 Bitcoin Bull is as just mine as the 3/9/09 stock bull, that lasted for 9.5 years.

In September we had nothing but short covering rallies and ran into the 200 day Moving average in November with a crash because the sellers hadn’t exhausted themselves, we also weren’t at the 200 week moving average that has been a critical support level in previous Bear markets,  that’s what makes this time different.

As someone who bought the bottom in stocks 3/9/2009 and also the bottom in bitcoin on 12/15/18, I’m expecting a LOT of similarities in how Bitcoin goes up compared to that Bull.  A slow and steady melt up of shorts along with buyers being dragged back into Bitcoin kicking in screaming.

And don’t forget, this is not new monetary policy in Fed  World �� They’ve done this in the 30’s 70’s and 80’s and probably most of its existence.  The difference is this time than those other times, people were actually paying attention to their policies when inflation happened and now they watch a shitshow that is Washington now.
Inflation is going to happen rapidly the more we prove we’re never going to pay off our debt, at a point, it will not help the stock market anymore that we’re printing money because it will be for all the wrong reasons and investors will sell.
Then Bitcoin ��.

I didn’t say I’m an expert, I’m saying the bottom is in, not that I know everything that ever existed fundamentally about bitcoin.
You are very fortunate to buy at $350 and you should look at these levels as just as attractive for a new entry point to buy more.
The bears were right, we had a bear market, we went down 84.3% after going from 160 to 20,000 in the last bull, and now a new bull market has started. Sorry if that’s not what you wanted to hear but it’s the truth.

In an intelligent and hopefully not annoying post, I want to say Bitcoin is like whatever the newest Apple phone or product is because it’s so revolutionary and will change how we conduct our lives. 
1. You wanna be in on this still near the ground floor. 
I bought Apple stock in 2009 when I saw the potential of the iPhone and it has rewarded me to this day
2.. If the latest product in an Apple store was 80% plus off the ath price, you’d think that people would camp out in line on that Sale.
This is an incredibly important moment to accumulate bitcoin a little at a time but constantly while you get sub 4-5k gift prices.

Everyone was quick to say Bitcoin was in a bear market when we went from 20k to 16k, the reverse is true off the bottom.  I was in crypto in feb 2017 buying bitcoin at 2k and selling it at 12k 9 months later, so I guess that makes me an inexperienced idiot.

I love how shorting works where you can lose infinity so at some point, you get a margin call and whether you think bitcoin will drop back down or not, you still have to buy back to close your position, we’ve been melting up since the low of 3350 a couple weeks ago, but over 4200 will turn into a str8 up shortsqueeze.

I don’t, I think the lows are in where we had a double bottom at 3350 in early February.  BUT once we break through the 200 day moving average.  It would be expected that there will be a retest of that 200 day moving average after we got to 5000-6000.  Just to prove we’re in a bull market for good.  That will be the last great buying opportunity other than right now.
@_date: 2019-03-16 09:48:13

I mean could we for example go to 100,000 then pull back to 60,000-70,000 before going into the 300-400k range? Sure. Or could we go from 20k to 12-14k on sellers from previous bull run getting their money back? Sure. But from these current levels, it’s an amazing opportunity to buy.
@_date: 2019-03-10 13:27:13
Well to make a long story short.  I buy Bitcoin because of this political belief. It’s a store of value in the long term where the insane moves up and down are just points to trade around a core position (I was a day trader as a 2nd job for 9 years). 
I bought the bottom in the Stock market 3/9/2009 and bought all the little dips after including 12/24/2018 because it was ALL predicated on what is called by economists as “The Fed Put” the point in every pullback/crash where the Fed said, ok, QE 1,2,3,4, infinity, to pump the bubble back up.
I have No doubt in my mind this will end badly at some point and Bitcoin will be King and the dollar will be in the toilet ��  That’s why I also bought the bottom on 12/15/18 real hard load the boat style because it will be a lot more valuable in the future.

It’s not a chart thing, it’s psychological, 5800 was once a area of support and it will be an area of resistance on the way up because people will sell who bought there to break even.
This goes the same for any asset, you could call Bitcoin a widget and I’d have the same analysis of the price action.

No, what he means is that everyone on the planet thinks it’s going to get to 1-2k and therefore it’s not because markets don’t reward everyone or else we’d all be rich.  Markets reward the contrarians that know when to buy low, sell high and tune out all the parroting echo voices around them which is what I suggest every bull do here and accumulate Bitcoin before we have a serious breakout from 4200 to 5800 where then % wise you are getting a lot less bitcoin for your buck.
Correct me if I’m wrong Dyidude2 :)

All my eggs are not in one basket, I have roughly 20% Apple right now from 100 shares, 20% Bitcoin from 4.5 BTC and 60% in devaluing dollars that I’m trying to hedge against for a store of value saving.
Bitcoin was first and is further along the race than whatever would try to dethrone it. The fact that it’s anonymous ownership and its foothold is already in so many places.  It’s got the advantage that can’t be replaced atleast not in the next 10 years.
And even if other people used other stuff for payments.  That’s not why I’m in Bitcoin.
I’m in it because it’s New Gold, a store of value based on Math that will allure central bankers with TRILLIONS of Dollars to buy Bitcoin as a hedge to their fiat reserves like the currently do with gold but with more trust because the inflation rate will basically run off to Zero.
I’d put 20% of what your savings are in it at these levels and go up to 30% in the case I’m wrong and we see 2000’s in the near term.
@_date: 2019-03-04 12:51:46
You bet your a$$ there’s an upside pennant and once that pennant breaks 4200, it’s game over for the bears!
@_date: 2019-03-16 12:18:40
I wouldn’t focus on the next few months as much as I would focus on the next block halving. I think the next resistance levels we go to after we break 4200 are 5800, 7800, and 10,800 but I’m expecting each one of them to be a battle the bulls have to win in a bitcoin rally war.
@_date: 2019-03-01 12:31:05
The stock market bottomed on 3/9/2009 because Ben Bernanke was on 60 minutes 2 days prior and they asked him, what are you going to do to save the banks? he said whatever it takes and then trillions of QE commenced that I would argue is the main driver behind for Bitcoins existence.
Psychology wise, both bottoms were the same, every analyst and their mother said it was a deadcat bounce from oversold levels and that we would go back down.  They then were brought back into the market kicking and screaming and with Bitcoin, it will be no different 
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:41:36
Bitcoins, yo
@_date: 2019-03-03 15:38:56
I think when the Fed prints trillions of dollars, that money finds it way into all asset markets including Bitcoin and if you notice, they seem to do it whenever the S&amp;P is in jeapordy of going into a bear market which is why Powell went from saying on 10/3/18 that rates are a long way from neutral to magically going dovish towards Christmas which then propped the market higher.
The lack of credibility in the Fed is what ultimately will destroy the Dollar which is extremely bullish for Bitcoin and the two party system running up our debt just boxes the Fed more and more in a corner to be accommodative and keep rates near 0.
I am explaining the short term to people so they understand how a bottom is not necessarily a point in time but as a process that we’ve been playing out since 12/15/18. I’ve used this entire period to accumulate where I know in my heart of hearts Bitcoin will be a 6 digit and then a 7 digit number sometime in my life.

Was in it feb 2017 to Nov 2017 bought 2 bitcoins for 2k each sold for 12k each. I was interested in it back in 2015 but didn’t know enough to get in then.
I waited after I sold my bitcoins for the rally to top out and for a bear market to ensue, I then studied about Bitcoin the whole time I wasn’t in it and bought back on 12/15/18 when it hit the 200 week MA while simultaneously showing a bullish divergence on the RSI monthly.
I’m not selling for a long time.

Congratulations for believing in the 12/15 bottom where as 99.999999% of bitcoin Reddit followers do not as you can see from the comments posted before me. That’s how we know the bottom is in. We’re breaking 4200 soon off an ascending triangle of higher lows since 12/15 and once we do, there’s no resistance to 5800 which at that point would be an 81% move from the lows and maybe then people will start to believe

@_date: 2019-02-28 09:22:14
Neither am I, I waited for Bitcoin to get to the 200 week moving average on 12/15 where I saw a bullish divergence in the rsi leading up to it, bought it, and watched a reversal pattern slowly take place since. It’s like being in the stock market on 3/9/2009 except these gains will be exponentially bigger than that bull over time.
@_date: 2019-02-28 21:53:36
That was a bull within a bear or in other terms a bear market rally, I look at the 1 year charts mainly, I know 4200 is a line in the sand and I’m very confident we’re wedging our way in an ascending triangle to get there where sellers will have been exhausted. I think this could happen as soon as a couple weeks from now which is nothing over the course of a 1 year chart

My story is that I was outta crypto from Nov 2017 until 12/15/18, bought 2 btc at 3200, 2 btc since and started a Twitter account where I literally made a religion of believing in the 12/15 bottom with my own 12/15er logo and I call myself the 12/15 Jesus since Roger Ver gave up his title as Bitcoin Jesus when he went to Btrash

Most people don’t know a Bitcoin is just a representation of 100 million satoshis where you can buy 5 bucks worth if you wanted and save it like a piggy bank if you can use a platform that has no fees

We have to wedge our way higher with higher lows to solidly break through 4200, but the good news is we’re putting in a higher low right now so the next time we get there, we could legit break out and retest the 5800 levels from which Bitcoin capitulated from in November

I got out after seeing Bitcoin being mentioned on the Big Bang Theory at 12k where it then seemed like any idiot would be buying it.  I then waited for it to top out then looked at the past where the 200 week moving average was prior support in the last bear market and understood that the average bear market is 80-90% down where the 12/15 bottom was 84% down so I took my shot at those levels

Someone told me it’s a bull walk right now but will turn into a bull run. I think above 4200 is where we break into another gear and we are wedging our way through higher lows and seller exhaustion to get there

Many people only buy bitcoin when it’s in favor and don’t understand its potential

I mean no new lows and that we got an Adam and Eve bottom in place on the charts

We are by definition in a bull market above 3800 being 20% off the lows of 3150, we might not be in a powerful bull so far, but a bull nonetheless

No phone? But how will Apple Or Android be able to spy on your every move then?

Got it, you win, from now on just memes through the desktop that have nothing to do with my twitter account, almighty one. I love how you said please after constantly ripping me for a paragraph

I’m hoping for it to be a boomshakalaka dunk after the halving next year.

The bears have been saying that for 2 months and 12 days now. We’re in a bull market, even up 20% plus off the lows which is the definition of a bull market.

I’ve been in and out of bitcoin for 3 years and am calling 12/15/18 the bottom.  I guess I’m not a noob until I’ve been in bitcoin for 30 years lol.
