I find it really funny that the signature year is 2016. Does this mean that the document is invalidated? 
This wouldn't be an issue with a signature on the blockchain.

Have you tried logging in via the blockchain plugin?
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:02:39
Try installing the authy app. I think it will request a phone number and you can use that 2fa code to login.

As the key and address are now compromised, can you post them up. Also, just to confirm, you never downloaded the backups?
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:46:33
The hacker never got into OP's blockchain account. Most likely the hacker attempted to log into blockchain to find other private keys but was unable to thanks to 2fa.
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:18:52
Enable 2fa on both your gmail and blockchain.

Thank you Jimmy for having an open mind about bitcoin, and for being a pioneer in free knowledge!

It sounds like your computer was compromised. A hacker must have gained access to your computer and swiped your backup. The hacker could have keylogged your blockchain password and was thus able to swipe your funds (from the backup). Finally after swiping the funds the hacker attempts to log into your blockchain account and that is when you receive the emails regarding the 2fa request and the funds being moved.

Once you share this public address, it is yours permanently. As long as people continue donating, the funds will be associated with your coinbase account. I would recommend contacting coinbase support see what they can do to turn this address into a Wikipedia donation address.

I think it would be better for an organization to use coinbase or bitpay for security concerns. Individual wallets are better suited for personal use.

This implies that Bitcoin is only for the wealthy. Not all individuals can part with 50c for each transaction. I would like to believe that Bitcoin is for everyone, but I would agree that a user should pay for a service used.

I cannot upvote this enough. The beauty of Bitcoin is in its open and decentralized form. If people are not incentivized to make a difference, Bitcoin will not change. It's a beautiful check of balance and power.
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:38:44
Nothing is for free in this world. If you want to see change, you should be putting money into hashing as well. The miners put millions into securing the network. It would make sense that the person who puts the most in has the most say.
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:50:21
This is the way to instill change. Kudos to you for putting your vote in. Consensus is brought about by hash power. Not people bickering about who is right or wrong. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:32:30
I'm surprised that people consider changing PoW as a viable solution. Whatever you change it to, there will be another "villian". That's the nature of free markets. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:08:22
This is ridiculous. The idea of injecting more politics into the Bitcoin free market is absurd. I approve of no censorship, but    this plan to use government interference to regulate aspects of Bitcoin is completely against the technology's core values.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:02:12
This brings up the question as to what consensus is. Is it what the miners say or is what the people who use it say? What's the threshold. I think of Bitcoin as an antifragile technology, so whatever the decision is, we will have a stronger Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:30:32
So what do you use Bitcoin for? As an asset for speculation? What good is security for an asset that you don't move. It's as useful as keeping money under my mattress.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:27:26
If Bitcoin is so susceptible to attack, why haven't more entities done so? I don't believe that BTC is that fragile.

I think that he is talking about how full each block is (ratio wise).

 Blocks are not being confirmed. How do you deposit BCH into an exchange without transferring BCH on the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-07-23 05:44:33
does that mean that running a full node is futile? If hashing has so much control, what good is it to switch to bitcoin-XT

People get angry that miners are selfishly mining, but then say that it's perfectly fine to pump an alt coin. This double standard is ironic and just goes to show that people only have their self interest in mind.

Friendly advice, enable 2 factor authentication !

This video really shows that we need better ways to transfer BTC. I imagine a system where we can tap, confirm, and go. NFC ftw.

If the government makes bitcoin illegal, the millions collected from silk road would have no value. They are pretty much throwing money down the drain. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:47:45
Keep up the great work! 
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:14:13
This may not be the next killer app, but it is something useful. We need some offline app to confirm that a private key really is the key to the public key we think it is. I would hate to send money to a offline wallet only to find that the private key doesn't match the public key. 
Support for bip0038 would be a plus.

Areed. If it rises too quickly, its likely to be dismissed as a bubble. I find it as good opportunity to buy cheap bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:49:15
In my experience it has been instant. The confirmation takes a little bit of time though, but it should show up in your account. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:08:23
Are you using the site or the plugin? Sometimes I find that my password doesn't work with the live site so give the plugin a try.
