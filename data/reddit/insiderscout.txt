Thank you for your reply and sharing your opinion.
Some say price is of a secondary importance when it comes to Bitcoin. There may be other uses which we are not aware of. What do you think about this?

There are millions of fans, their teams didn't qualify...so champions of the hearts?

Champions of 2014 by coin or by team, I think it was the right place.

Government bodies are checking the potential for a cryptocurrency for some time but there is no official statement further than that. However in 20.06.2013, Regulation reference 6493  law regarding Payment and Assets Agreement Systems and Electronic Money Institutions  declares that  mentioned technologies are not electronic money and in this perspective now applicable in law. An updated law and regulation is expected but till then citizens are warned against the risks.

True, Banks and institutions are lacking the know-how and this leads to alienation. Investment giants are loosing their brightest to startups these days. Do you think cryptocurrency will eventually find it's place among traditional banking and finance word?

"bitcoin is not a real money, banks and financial institutions should keep clear of it and not authorize any operations related with it" was an earlier official announcement by government authorities, which later discussed the potential of a national cryptocurrency under the government administration.

Cryptocurrency is an unknown thing in Turkey. It is quite easy to fall on such schemes especially since the economy is in ruins for the average Joe. Ignorance is a big factor as you mentioned, but the complete lack of regulations, knowledge and widespread misinformation in this area is staggering as well.

Currently there are no laws or  regulations related to cryptocurrencies in Turkey, however officials declared that "Bitcoin is not a money" and thus financial bodies are not to execute any operations related to cryptocurrencies. There are ongoing talks about a National cryptocurrency, building a regulative base etc. however none of them are published on official documents.
There are several crypto related exchanges and news agencies operating in Turkey.
Coinatmradar didn't turn with any results for BitcoinATM's.

 What is a 'Reserve Currency'
A reserve currency is a large quantity of currency maintained by central banks and other major financial institutions to prepare for investments, transactions and international debt obligations, or to influence their domestic exchange rate. A large percentage of commodities, such as gold and oil, are priced in the reserve currency, causing other countries to hold this currency to pay for these goods.

Maybe. Or maybe you prefer to have a dinner, grab some drinks and pay with Bitcoin, then take a taxi which accepts Bitcoin, drive to nearest Bitcoin ATM and get a massage for Bitcoin in a salon?  Possibilities...
