@_date: 2015-06-28 16:17:26
yeah but afaik reid hoffman is paying them millions to do it in a way that relies upon blockstream - who as a company are not aligned with satoshi's vision of bitcoin as cash. thats a conflict of interest.

I have a bunch of addresses and keys generated offline in armory. I have the wallet seed backed up on paper, and I also have the individual public and private keys for all addresses in the wallet backed up, in case I want to sweep one of them into another wallet. Can i do this with trezor? 
Also in case of disaster, if I need to recover my trezor wallet using the seed in the future, can i do that from any other deterministic wallet like armory? or do I have to use another trezor?

Are there key loggers that can hitch a ride on USB drives? Say for example, youve got an offline machine running armory, and an online machine to create transactions and watch your balance.

More merchants need to start holding bitcoin. If I were CEO of a major retailer, I'd get together with all of the other big retailers and some billionaires, and conspire to accept and buy bitcoin and just hold it, causing the value to rise. Then borrow money to cover my business overhead at an interest rate thats less than the rate of the price rise for bitcoin.

i'd just go buy 10 now on coinbase and set up weekly recurring buys for the rest. then youve got your 10, and the rest will be dollar cost averaged. if you just want to buy and hodl, i wouldnt try to buy dips and get into the trading game... as stable as its been for a while now, bitcoin is a strange beast and trying to predict highs and lows will just drive you nuts. remember to move your coins off of coinbase to your hardware wallet (buy one) as soon as you buy them so youre not subject to any major capital gains or losses to report.

the pervasive view of classic devs is that we should be developing all of these scaling solutions concurrently, so the argument that the intention is to thwart segwit or LN is totally false. segwit wont help the current scaling bottleneck.

Unwillingness of miners to activate SW before further size bumps implies hidden agenda.
Do you remember your bitcoin history? A blocksize bump is much less complex than segwit, and could have been ready much earlier than segwit, particularly if core had led the way and followed through with it. It was discussed and debated for a long time, compromised down from 20 to 8 to 4 to 2MB, and stalled via waiting for scaling conference after scaling conference, some of which only core were even invited to, while segwit was being developed. What you are saying now is exactly what the "big blockers" were saying long ago...  the unwillingness of core to HF to 2MB, even though all parties agreed this would not kill decentralization, implies a hidden agenda. 
At this point I do wish that everyone would just signal for segwit so we can move on and keep working on scaling. But I would much prefer for core to have led a 2MB HF + segwit. It would immediately end this war and we would be wearing our moonboots.
If you do agree then that that would not kill decentralization, as you were previously so vociferously stating, then now tell me why you think this toxic environment is preferable to that?
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:15:09
I think both sides want that, there's just disagreement as to how to do it. Core thinks letting miners create bigger blocks will kill decentralization, BU thinks not onboarding more users now to maintain our network effect and grow the ecosystem thereby creating more miners will kill decentralization. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:27:12
both sides do want decentralization. what do you think all of that compromising down to a 2MB HF + segwit was about? But that never happened, did it? we could have both, and core could lead the way. a little bump now via a core led HF to improve the current use experience, plus segwit. dont be naive to the fact that there are big vcs that would like a big piece of the fee market via layer 2 solutions.

I dont understand how the CEO and the CTO of blockstream arent communicating with each other.

good points. i wasnt really thinking about it in terms of reinventing copy protection. just brainstorming possible new business models for industries like film and tv, where traditional distribution channels are fast becoming obsolete because of p2p tech. 
something like this could also bypass middlemen like apple and pay the creators directly, who in turn could charge the viewer less by cutting out distribution fees.

Ethereum is great and it definitely makes sense to hold some, but not too much given segwit is looking closer. With that we will get a trustless RSK sidechain for smart contracts that is also backwards compatible with ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:35:45
even then, just dont hold your coins there. move your coins from coinbase to your own wallet right after you buy them, since coinbase reports that as a sell. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:49:46
I'm just saying that if you transfer coins out of coinbase right after you buy them, there would be no gains or losses for them to report 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:38:03
this. i used to think a lot about how i wish i had bought btc when i first read about it, but back then i felt like sending cash to japan in hopes of getting virtual currency back was a risk i didnt want to take, so i didnt. but even if i had, would i have held all the way up until now? would i have kept my coins on gox like a lot of people, only to lose it all and get angry? would i have transferred it to silk road and spent it all on weed? i could see any of those things happening, so i look at it now like i got in at just the right moment. HODL.
EDIT: except for not buying eth back during the crowdsale. i still feel like an idiot for that.

"the effort to do so would be require a massive covert operation of chip fabrication, then the coordinated assault that would give them dominance over the next block for ten minutes until we kick those bastards off the network, rework the protocol around them; they would be revealed, they would have lost a billion dollars doing this, and all they got to do was one double spend"

Craig almost certainly knew Dave kleiman and Hal Finney, whether or not he's actually satoshi. He also clearly has a deep understanding of the protocol, much more so than Samson. I'm going to judge him on merit and the code he produces, rather than what the chief whatever of blockstream wants me to think

Jesus. I'm just giving him the same patience we gave core during the year we were all forced to wait for segwit . I'm not predicting whether or not his solution will be good before we see it, I'm just saying I'm not willing to condemn someone for reasons that have little to do with what we are trying to achieve here. The fact that some people here arent even willing to give the guy a chance and put so much energy into condemning him is a sign of fear. If he sucks so much, lets all clear the way and let him hang himself. If he doesnt suck, hey, bonus we all win.

@_date: 2017-07-01 19:47:12

ive said this a few times before when it comes up because it annoys me to see people who havent been around get the history wrong. its not that simple. back did made an agreement under the pretense that he was representing core interests after the community had debated and negotiated from 20 to 8 to 4 then to 2MB blocks that everyone said would not harm the network, only after the fact clarifying that he was only representing himself when greg called him a dipshit. would the players in the Hong Kong agreement have wasted their time otherwise? It was a shitshow and devolved into a years long battle with miners hating core for reneging/misleading them. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:02:47
hey man all im saying here is that the narrative that the miners are lying about core agreeing to the hk agreement isnt so blakc and white. Back went to hk with the entire community presuming he was representing core interests. i dont recall a single core dev at the time on any forum saying that he was NOT representing core interests PRIOR to the hk meeting. think about it-- if the chinese miners had an inkling that the whole agreement had no actual weight with core, why in the hell would they have even showed up? he came back to the states after signing off in the meeting, then presumably had a meeting with other core members who ripped him a new one, after which he reneged and said he was only representing himself. then we all had to wait through conference after conference, devs from both sides getting mad that they werent invited to this or that conference until they rolled out segwit. its not surprising that the miners felt they were misled. and now we're back to segwit+2mb, a fucking miracle after the last few years, and a lot of people are celebrating having 'tricked' the miners into activating segwit because ha-ha we're just going to ignore the 2mb part. im super excited that segwit got locked in, but im concerned about what will happen when the miners feel like theyre just going to get fucked again. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:11:06
i think hes talking about the fatal bug he found that he wont tell anyone about.

@_date: 2017-07-01 19:55:57
so you are not even remotely interested in looking at the code/solution he may release in the future? youre so positive he's full of shit, that youre just going to plug your ears and close your eyes to a solution from a person with deep pockets and deep understanding of bitcoin that claims to have the answer to scale onchain like weve always dreamt about? like i said, if it sucks, no one will use it. if it doesnt then we all benefit from this. why are you afraid of that?

ok, how about i edit my comment to completely leave out anything addressing whether or not he knew dave or hal, or is or is not satoshi. Im not going to play that game, no matter how badly blockstream wants us all to. 
He STILL clearly has a deeper understanding of the protocol, still much more so than samson, and Im still going to judge him on merit and code he produces. Don't lose sight of the forest for the trees.

I could concede all of your points but it still doesnt really explain why the core devs won't simply allow 2mb blocks and end this war, when both sides have done the research and stated that it wouldn't break bitcoin or anything. Can you explain why?

I wouldnt go so far as to calling it 'lying.' Adam Back did in fact make an agreement under the pretense that he was representing core interests, only after the fact clarifying that he was only representing himself.

Wow. I never blamed any 'innocent uninvolved core devs,' you need to calm down bud.
I dont blame anyone. Im just saying what actually happened. If I had to, maybe I'd blame Adam and Greg for causing some loss of confidence in the core devs by not communicating with each other, which certainly didnt help anything. I get it, this is a war for control and any alternate proposals that might have undermined segwit's value proposition had to be stalled until it was ready. I am not nearly technical enough to determine whether or not the real impetus was for patent rights, as there were many conflict-of-interest accusations at the time, or if segwit is just genuinely a better product and they had to ensure its success or bitcoin would die.  My personal opinion does not matter, but at this point I just want to see segwit deployed with or without a 2MB hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:40:05
I think theyre just pretending to hate it, because they know that a lot of people wont get behind it if they think core supports it.

I understand what you're saying but you honestly didn't find that in the slightest bit disingenuous? Again, would the miners that attended the Hong Kong have still attended had they known he was only representing himself? This was also after a year of negotiations from 20 to 8 to 4 to finally 2 mb that pretty much everyone said wouldn't break bitcoin

Do more research on wallets, private keys, and how they work. Itll help you get past the idea that its a risk. The funding/secret word thing that localbitcoins uses seems pretty secure to me.
Best practice if youre serious about bitcoin is to get a computer that never touches the internet, create a watching only wallet on it with something like Armory or Electrum, make a paper backup and put that in a safe deposit box. You could then destroy all computers if you wanted to, and still recover your btc using only your paper backup. 
If this is confusing, do some research because its important.

here is how i remember my experience with localbitcoins.
set up a meeting through the site. got verified. 
the seller agreed to a price and meeting place, and funded my account. 
localbitcoins gave me a secret word that will only be known to the seller after he releases the btc. we meet, i hand him the money. 
he counts the money, then releases the btc. 
localbitcoins tells him the secret word, which signifies that the btc are deposited my account. 
he tells me the secret word, then we shake hands and walk away.
As far as bringing your wallet, deal with someone who has good feedback obviously. Then make sure whatever you have on you doesnt have your private keys on it.

So is btc a currency or a commodity? I can see diversifying my position in commodities like gold or silver or oil, because they have different real world uses. Since btc and other virtual currencies are virtual, and being that btc and ltc are so similar with the exception of market cap/mining difficulty, I having trouble seeing why they would be diverse products at all. It seems more akin to say, using dollars and pesos in the same country.
