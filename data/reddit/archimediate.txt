Someone stole my mood ring. I'm not really quite sure how I feel about that...

I just don't know how to explain it to my wife. Haha.

They are usually transferred to a very long "key" that only you should have access to.

Waiting to hear back.

Thanks for this. I don't see cancel so I guess I have to wait it out.

"Here's free coins!"
*doesn't raise hand*
I fire your question back at you.
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:18:01
Very much so agree!

It's a journey! Mine is 11 months this week. Kinda crazy.

You actually honored a trade I made about three weeks ago but a rather large order last week that was processed incorrectly cost me roughly $1400. So, are we talking honoring this in the amount of coins at a high for last week or the low for today?

My bank actually called and told me they would be reversing the transaction and charging me roughly $40.  I was fairly sad. Haha.

Coins at the time of my funding were roughly $80 before the skyrocket...  I lost so much money because of these guys.

That was my main problem. I didn't have 7k to invest. It was just an accident on the coinbase website. Ha
