It seems you have a solid academic background

Reading this thread makes me feel like Scrooge McDuck :D

But you do not get them for free :)
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:52:02
Not if you are running Windows...

You mean over
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:21:13
and last for months...
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:46:28
and we are at $2000 now. Give the bubble time to burst :)
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:37:53
And expect huuuuge price dump :)
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:11:29
I would expect something that can be measured.
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:23:38
couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:40:56

I'm not sure we should confuse noobs with the distinction between seed and private keys. We (oldtimers) know the difference, but is it really necesary to grasp it? With seed you can create/restore privkeys, hence we can simplify that seed=privkeys... Let noobs guard the seed and they will be safe
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:41:38
probably lower, I think $1300-$1400
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:03:39
Actually it is as it should be - you do not wait 10 minutes for webpage to load, no? You just hit the "GO" button and there it is. With sending/receiving money should be the same
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:24:21
I don't see the pump, only dump...
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:40:32
Stop counting fees in $fiat and relax

And if one of these devices breaks, you are screwed...
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:06:47
Big (costly, P2P) transactions on-chain, daily (cheap, with third parties) transactions off-chain. It is different than original idea, but maybe it is the only way...
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:29:20
As long as you have your private keys OR recovery seed you may "put" your bitcoins in any wallet - UASF or legacy
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:36:07
I am curious how far it need to go, so he sees the problem? $500? $1000? $10000 per transaction
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:11:52
When trying to open lightning channel it is stuck with "WAIT_FOR_FUNDING_CONFIRMED". 30 minutes now
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:39:59
It is better - technically there are no bitcoins, just transaction records :)
