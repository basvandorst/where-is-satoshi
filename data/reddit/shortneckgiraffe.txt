Ok, still silence from them but I was able to finally complete my transaction last night. Hope this helps.

FYI: Silence from Circle since that last email that said they were working on it

Yep, definitely no other women on this sub unless they need to make it a point to mention it.

I was having issues converting from my card. I contacted them via the website and by email when I didn't hear back. I just got an email reply this morning stating they are working on the issue. Hope this helps! Will post again when I know more.

Thank you so much for your patience, ugh, I hate feeling like a noob and asking questions because sometimes on reddit you get "Why don't you google it", and at this point, I'm so inexperienced I found many things were going a bit over my head. Thank you so much for an honest and kind answer.

I could get electrum to download (I think I used the below line but specified a directory), but couldn't get it to install- just giving it the command line  in terminal "sudo pip install  wouldnt do anything for me at all. What am I doing wrong? This is my first time using a Linux based OS
@_date: 2012-07-01 03:07:26
Sorry, that wasn't even meant to be a link, RES linked that automatically. The instructions from Electrum's website state for linux:
"In a terminal, type:
sudo pip install 
Then, to start Electrum, type electrum"
that is what I was trying to say previously, no links...ignore those, those are the instructions verbatim from  
I'll look into Bitsafe though, thanks for the info! I'm completely new to Linux and all its other flavors (ubuntu, tails...) so I'm just kinda googling as I go.

Really? And how is that, exactly? Are they going to deliver the package themselves? Unless they watch you open it/prove you opened it/used it you have plausible deniability- anyone can send you a package. Are they going to prove you ordered it somehow? Taking the correct precautions it is extremely unlikely to get apprehended via SR. Do your research first, or you're no better than this news channel.

Makes sense! Thanks again for all your help :)

Sure, I haven't tried it out yet, but I'll probably try this weekend and comment reply back if this works, so that other people also searching for this info have it available as well :)

How the fuck else are you suppose to pronounce it? Even if it's an acronym, usually if the acronym spells out a word, you pronounce it as the word.

You can put an email address in BOTH the destination account and notification email. If you do that, it will ask you to select a bank/location at which you would like to make a deposit. From there, it will give you a screen you can print with the account number at that specific bank/location you chose which will accept the deposit. Then you follow a link from that email where you can coinapult the coins to a bitcoin address.  PM for more specifics if you'd like, I just did this earlier this week.

I too, have heard of "controlled delivery" and have yet to actually see proof of it on other than a bunch of people talking about it the rumor mill. If you remember the situation with T, there were several people claiming he got nabbed, several people claiming he simply took off. No proof. The people I have seen talk about controlled delivery happening (assuming that is really happening as much as they claim) have also had packages disappear and the like, and were probably not being smart and diligent about the situation overall. Also, they were ordering huge quantities, or specific chemicals that were considered dangerous or used for making huge quantities of other illegal things. The mail service, and LE for that matter, are not going to bust down your door over 5 pills or a gram of anything. Order domestic, order from vendors you trust about their packaging practices and it's likely to very fairly safe, though not completely devoid of risk

Ok, so another, possibly dumb question on my behalf:  I have persistence- So on my live USB I have a permanent partition where I can actually save things and they stay there with each boot, if I installed Electrum there would it not stay with each boot? It seems like it's a compact enough file to fit within the partition I alotted
@_date: 2012-07-01 03:00:38
Sorry I was super unclear, I am attempting to install electrum running Tails live USB- which I understand is not exactly the same as Linux, just built on similar kernel? The line/command I quoted is from electrum's website. It states to enter that command into the terminal, then type "electrum" to get it to run.
@_date: 2012-07-01 04:09:02
Great! That's actually what I was starting to glean from all of this- that I didn't have "pip". And I agree, it's possible Electrum is not meant to run on a live system, even with persistence. Thanks for your help!
