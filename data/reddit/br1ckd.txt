It's not easy, but it's happened and will almost certainly happen again. Since the risk/reward ratio for stealing bitcoin this way is so low (an exit node using a signed cert to sniff SSL probably wouldn't be detected) I think this exact scenario isn't that unlikely.

It's possible to MitM without changing the signature. The attacker would just need to steal the website's SSL certificate. That sounds easier than an MitM where the signature changes, which would require an attacker to steal a CA's certificate (which should be much harder to steal). Also, there are legitimate reasons the certificate signature could be different, like if they're using round-robin DNS and their different servers have different SSL certificates, or if you just happen to check while they're changing their certificates (certificates should expire and be changed periodically).

The NSA aren't the only ones with stolen (or at least illegitimate) certificates.

My money is only secured with a 4-digit pin. That's only ~13.3 bits of entropy (3.3 bits per digit). Technically I use 2FA (an ATM/debit card), but I'd hand it over to almost anyone standing behind a cash register without a second thought. Kinda scary when you think about it.

Random 14-character passwords are pretty secure, but they wouldn't test every possible password. They'd use a wordlist and a set of rules to generate likely passwords. If you look at the lists of passwords from sites that got hacked, the cracked passwords almost always have English words and maybe a symbol and number or 2, and there are always a lot of them that have been cracked.

Not necessarily, a [remote file inclusion]( bug could reveal a cert without giving access to the server. It would also be a lot easier for a hacker to avoid detection (by both an IDS/IPS and the sysadmin/users) if they just stole the cert.


Has that ever happened without the CA being hacked? Issuing bad certs is a major trust issue, and untrustworthy CA's aren't trusted by browsers.


Where did you get that number from? There are only 148 certs in [Firefox's default store]( and Linux Mint has only 168 certs in /etc/ssl/certs.


Blockchain.info might, but not every website uses CF. Checking signatures on a signed cert doesn't mean much. The whole point of CAs and signing certificates is so you don't have to verify signatures.
