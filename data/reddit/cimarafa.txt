I think it's clear he was somehow involved in the creation, or at least in the very early days, of Bitcoin.  
It has never been likely that it was a single individual who did the entire thing, something that was only propagated by fantasists who wanted to believe in the myth of some insane, white-haired Japanese inventor changing the world forever in his (computer science) laboratory.  Bitcoin was a group effort, and the more people in the group, the higher the likelihood that someone talks, or takes credit, at some point.

There's only so many times you can quietly chuckle to yourself and stroke your imaginary beard.  Eventually he, like almost everyone else, probably wanted his due fame.

I think of all the arguments that it's a hoax, the idea that this guy would be nicer irl is a pretty weak one.

Absolutely- and yet all that was previously known about SN was via online correspondence, in which his style could just be an act. We all like to act differently online- some like to act out, become trolls and assholes online.  Others like to pretend they're more magnanimous than they really are.   Perhaps this guy liked seeming humble.  But after years of seeing his own creation become so powerful and important, he developed an ego.  Hardly surprising.
