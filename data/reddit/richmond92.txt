I thought they went PoS?

I agree with him, but I also just read an article where he calls Ethereum Classic "basically a hybrid of Bitcoin and Ethereum", which has cut his credibility in half for me.

Ah, my mistake then.

Just because it has feathers doesn’t mean it’s a chicken. Immutability is a feature of many cryptocurrencies. ETC functions minimally like bitcoin does, and I’m my opinion cannot be likened to it.

He also didn't have avocado toast.

Attn: my grandmother texted me about bitcoin last night and already has a coinbase account. If your grandmother is buying bitcoin, that's a sign that something is happening...

This video is unintentionally hilarious in so many ways. 15 minutes of a giant dude lifting weights with about 45 seconds of highly involved cryptocurrency chatter right in the middle. Amazing.

Cute but weird and a bit too much...

Strap the fuck in.

Dude you are not in the right mind to be investing. Clearly you have no clue what you've just thrown your money at, and you have no clue how markets operate. They rise and then they fall. It's part of a healthy continuum. The harder the bull run, the harder the bear run. Relax, maybe sell some of your assets, and wait to rebuy at a lower price. This isn't the end of the world.

This is how you deter people from bitcoin

No, you wouldn’t.
