[Actually someone did tell the CEO of eBay and he decided to break up with PayPal](
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:35:46
That is a great point. It seems to me, PayPal has more competition. I know many alternatives to PayPal, but no real alternative to eBay. (craigslist could be argued, but they are hardly the same market)
However at the end of the day, I don't really know enough about either company to have a valid opinion on the matter other than parroting what I've heard.

I'm sorry I'm not familiar with that? can you please explain a little more

They certainly aim to lead people to believe that's the case.


It does not matter if every tether originally cost $1 if you can't exchange it in the opposite direction. What's the point of there being 100 tether issued, and 100 USD in a bank if you can't trade 1 tether for 1 USD. Then just sell tether and spend the money. There doesn't need to be a reserve if there is no cash out method, but they claim to hold it in reserve to keep that illusion going.

But tether is specifically centralised, and it needs to be as a fixed point to centralised fiat. It's a bridge between crypto and fiat, and therefore has a centralized leg that needs proper auditing to prove to the community it is what it says it is

No, I wouldn't. But i've long accepted that there are terrible people in the world. I think you'd fit the bill.

Less people than how many would have from buying drugs off the street. At least on the Silk road it was peer reviewed for quality, and you don't have the risk of getting assaulted/robbed/killed by shady street dealers. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:19:07
While its totally fair to be skeptical, I know that silk road was well regarded amongst my peers for the safety it added. I don't know of anyone who had received bunk product from the silk road, whereas that is a regular occurrence on the street. I know street dealers who pride themselves on making a profit selling sketchy analogs as the real deal cause 'nobody knows the difference'. The peer review process mostly eliminated that.   
I have seen out of their mind drug dealers show up with half the product and demand twice the money because concepts like measurements are beyond their current state of mind. They feel like you are ripping them off and pull weapons and make threats. That doesn't happen through silk road. 
If you're not in the game, it may not make sense, and I can respect that. Seeking evidence is the appropriate avenue. However, as someone who is surrounded by this kind of shit, the silk road was a saving grace, and not a single person I have encountered who used the silk road has ever told me otherwise.

I'm sorry, could you please explain? Can drop box go through all my computer files that are not in my drop box folder, or just that they go through my files I have hosted with dropbox?
Thank you.

Ok so I get I need a wallet to use them (any recommendations?), but this has a deposit address. If I hit accept, where does it go? Is this some sort of account linked to my reddit account that I didn't create but will have access to? This is all so exciting and confusing!
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:34:08
Excellent. I've been meaning to get into Bitcoin, and now that I have a dollar, I really do feel incentivized to hop on it. Do you recommend any particular wallets for it?
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:09:25
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-01-21 22:47:15
Ok cool. That I assumed. I was worried for a second having a drop box folder installed on my cp gave them the rights to look through all my files as part of that terms of service agreement I blindly agreed to without actually reading. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:09:14
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:10:18
Thank you. I've done a little research. I get the gist. I understand what they are and the buying, I just hadn't seen anything about storing yet, so I figured I'd ask. Thanks for the information. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 22:17:08
Sorry to be ignorant, but I am looking to start purchasing bitcoins. Can someone please explain how I store them. Are they just a file on my computer, or do I need to set up a 'bank account' of some sort somewhere? I'm just not really sure how the holding onto them part works.
Thank you.

Or the LE drafted a parallel story to appease the need for evidence while still hiding their true techniques. The DEA was recently outted for getting evidence from the NSA and fabricating where the evidence actually came from/ the evidence itself. Whats to say that is not happening here.
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:21:34
Hey, can you explain the bitcoin tipping thing? Is it like reddit gold but promoting bitcoin, and giving money to content creators rather than features?
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:39:13
Cool. Thank for the informative answer. I didn't know that. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:35:38
Do the vendors know who the buyer is to return the bitcoins, or is there some sort of give these back to whence they came option?
@_date: 2013-10-09 02:30:26
I don't disagree with you, but I wouldn't take that report as evidence that those strategies will keep you safe.
