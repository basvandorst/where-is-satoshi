A term you should be aware of is "affinity fraud".
It's much easier to commit fraud when you can convince the victim that you're both members of some kind of group. A person with technocratic, anti-banking, and/or libertarian leanings is going to be a lot more susceptible to Bitcoin-related scams than people who don't share those views.

Explaining how it *actually* works would defeat the purpose of having a simplified analogy that gets the point across. And that point was that what one does to one half of the entangled pair cannot produce observable results on the other half.

It doesn't matter how fast the waveform collapse propagates because it doesn't transmit any information.
Let's back up to what you said earlier:


This statement is false.
Quantum entanglement is akin to tearing a book in half, then putting the two halves into separate boxes. When you open one box, you instantly know what's in the other box no matter how far away it is. But there is no FTL communication.
And if you set one book half on fire, the other doesn't burst into flames.
Physicists have proven that there is nothing that can be done to one half of an entangled system that can be detected on the other half.
