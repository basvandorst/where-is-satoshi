I lost 10 btc by trading between 2011 and 2013. Unless you are very lucky, it's not worth playing that game. Better to just hold and forget about it for some time IMO.

Do we know that the intended murder victim was innocent?
Not that I think that murder is a good solution to anything, but I'm curious about the motive and to what extent DPR's ire against the intended victim was justifiable (not that murder ever is).

The 200k stash is probably all there is. I see no reason why it should not be distributed pro rata to bitcoin holders, but I doubt Japanese law allows for that. Fiat holders should get their share of funds in fiat. No bitcoins need to be purchased.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:57:31
Agreed. But tell that to someone even less computer literate than myself, and I doubt they'll want to put their money into something like that.
@_date: 2014-03-20 17:56:18
Maybe. On the other hand, for all we know Mark and cronies control more bitcoin than they care to let on. This seems very likely to me, given that they showed evidence of these ~200k BTC via the API, and now it's shut off.

While I abhor violence, the Boston bombing is an unfair comparison to this situation. Furthermore I don't see how Boston could be considered vigilante justice. But I guess that's not the most important part of the point I would like to make.
These people would be betting on (and not necessarily advocating) whether someone who cheated and lied to the severe detriment of thousands of people will meet what many be considered his rightful demise.
The people injured and killed in Boston were innocent.
I'm not suggesting that Mark deserves death as punishment, but I can imagine that quite a few do considering the massive amount of damage he has done. So unless he gets satisfactorily resolves the Gox disaster, I would place my bet on him not making it out of this in one piece.
I don't plan on making that bet because I personally consider it unethical, but my guess is that people will be making money by betting on his demise.
@_date: 2014-05-26 19:43:21
Again, I did not keep the coins there long-term, only to make big trades. I just happened to be trading at the wrong time.
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:41:24
I'm sorry, but "manning up" when you have been robbed doesn't seem relevant here. I took the huge market risk and won. Anyone can be blindly robbed, and if it ever happens to you to such an extent, I'll bet your dick will look like a pussy in no time.
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:40:31
I'm genuinely very sorry to hear that. Some of us are goxxed, others are stamped.
Interestingly I wanted to move my BTC from Gox to Bitstamp in November but they denied my verification.
Now I wonder whether any of these exchanges can be considered remotely professional.

Fifty. I was going to move them to Bitstamp a while ago, but they turned down my verification. And I didn't want to have them on Coinbase because I couldn't trade there. CampBX had too low volume.

One could sell bitcoins at the parallel market rate and live off the pesos -- assuming one lived there. Otherwise I suppose you could use the pesos to buy goods and sell them at home (I know many who have paid for their flights by selling tango shoes at a big mark-up alone).
Admittedly it's not very efficient, but worthwhile if you don't mind the trip.

I've been using bitcoin for almost 3 years. Gox got hacked, but I got by BTC back. Tradehill shut down and made off with them, but I got them back years later.
Now it looks like they are gone forever, but I still believe in them. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:58:19


Why not? They both decided by themselves to convert fiat into bitcoin, and bitcoin is what they should get back out. The dollar value should be inconsequential, as we are now talking about bitcoin value.
Personally I would love to get my funds back according to OP's suggested method, but in it I see one injustice being exacerbated by yet another one, and can't morally defend that.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:19:26
A lot of sites had some really bad issues. Gox's were probably the worst, but they also showed in the past that they fixed their mess-ups. 
If any other else goes under (oops, another small one already has since then), there's going to be a lot of "told you so" going on about the next big security nightmare.
So go ahead and feel superior if your coins ever get stolen from an unregulated exchange in Slovenia. Of but of course a smart guy like you probably uses cold storage.
What a great economy we're going to build with a bunch of hoarded coins in cold storage.

@_date: 2014-10-14 03:00:09
I believe legal action against MtGox is impossible as they are under bankruptcy protection.
Mark is just happy to be out of the whole thing, and he's not planning to lift a finger to do anything about it.
The remaining assets of MtGox are presumably being drained by lawyers, who have extended the deadline for the claims, presumably because it's in their interest to take what little is left.
I don't think that we're going to get any of what's ours back.

@_date: 2014-02-27 10:47:09


Hell yeah, it does. I've been in bitcoin for 2 years, numerous security measures, and I just happened to have a lot on gox because I wanted to trade and they had low fees and volatility. I tried moving the coins I gained back to another exchange and it was too late.
If 6% of a currency in circulation can be hijacked without recourse, I doubt there are too many potential customers looking to get into something like that.'
To hell with the future of bitcoin. I was an avid believer since 2011, and all that effort I put into it was gone. Something like this can and will happen again, I'll bet.
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:42:52
This is true, and I lost everything by keeping my money on gox. But if one wants to trade in a fast-moving market, it's a pain in the ass to transfer and then have to wait for 6 verifications before you can set your bid or ask.
@_date: 2014-06-15 23:30:54
Yeah, I remember arguing with you. Figures that you like that guy.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:42:21
It took a long time, but I doubled by bitcoins by day trading. That would never have happened if I had to move those coins out of cold storage every time. Not to mention that often I waited for less than an hour, but sometimes quite a lot more. That times means a lot when people are panic buying or selling. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:12:24

@_date: 2014-10-23 14:16:57
It must really be great to have been proven right in retrospect, but there were warnings and red flags against all high-volume exchanges at some point or another. Anyone who uses an exchange is putting himself at risk.

I completely understand that you have no problem with stolen bitcoins. It's just interesting how you seem to need to put down the victims to justify it to yourself. Not to mention that "liberated" implies that the theft was somehow virtuous.

So if you buy coins from an exchange and never move them from your account, you never own them? I'm sure that's a nice settling thought for the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2014-05-26 08:07:15
I bought my first bitcoins in 2011 at MtGox and they had been safe the whole time while other sites were having massive problems. In fact I lost 40 BTC when Tradehill went down, and it took me around 2 years to get them back.
Then the fiat situation at Gox came up and I got nervous, but I didn't trust other exchanges all the same, and some of them had their own issues.
If I had gotten into Bitcoin later, like in 2013, I probably would not have touched Gox. But already having used them for 2+ years without any unsolved problems (related to the integrity of my account, anyway) gave me a false sense of security.
Why would/should I move to Japan?
PS To really answer your question, I never thought about the marketing. Gox looked like a Web 1.0 site when I joined.
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:55:32
Well in that case, those of us who were fucked by gox slightly appreciate the limited amount of care you are showing. And when another exchange screws you over, we promise to care less about your protest as well.
@_date: 2014-10-23 14:14:18
Did anyone actually say this, though? I desperately want to believe that Mark said something about customer bitcoins being held in cold storage, but I've not really found anything substantial.
@_date: 2014-04-21 04:37:33
But that's not what I was addressing, and I think I made a clear point that murder should not be tolerated. This, however, has no bearing on the possible culpability of the target.
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:56:32
Not necessarily disagreeing with you on an ideological level, but in a world in which a $7000 rocket can kill multiple people who engaged in no crimes at all, how much value does the life of a person have if that person has destroyed the lives of others?

@_date: 2014-07-05 03:33:50
I don't think so.
Mark lied about transaction malleability and cold wallets, and he let Mt. Gox continue to trade after disabling withdrawals. Incorporating should not give someone a carte blanche against such acts.
@_date: 2014-06-27 14:08:20
There is no public information about this that I can find, and I have been looking. A lot.

Ah, no, I hadn't seen that. Thanks for pointing me to it.
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:29:00
I don't trust Karpeles any further than I can throw him, but for now I'm giving Gox the benefit of the doubt because I was all-in during the 2011 fiasco during which they got hacked, and though they handled the situation quite poorly in many respects, I did eventually get all my coins back.
@_date: 2014-05-26 08:16:13
You're right, it was absolutely stupid. At first I just put in what I could lose. Over time things worked out so well that I kept buying. I had a decent job and could afford to live well, and I still had money in the bank.
Much later got sick, lost job, cashed out enough to live but no more than that, got goxxed, went through the rest of my cash...yeah, no smart moves there. But it looked fantastic just six months ago.
BTW I don't really feel like my life is destroyed -- that was meant a bit tongue-in-cheek, but I do feel like I have lost out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and having been a firm believer in bitcoin from the start, this all makes me feel really sick.
Edit: I should also point out that I did not keep my coins on gox, but rather moved them there from my wallet for big trades -- it happens that I was trading when I lost access to them.
@_date: 2014-05-26 23:48:47
Well, I'm an American and have lived outside the USA for half my life, but so far I don't see any reason to move to Japan. If it helps my case, I'll consider it.
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:40:50
Not if you want to trade. Volatility appears quickly in this game, and waiting for 6 confirmations to hit your account means lost opportunities. Or at least it did until Karpeles changed the rules.
@_date: 2014-05-19 05:43:35
Well if jail is not a punishment, then I suppose we ought to free all white collar criminals and let them live large on the money they've stolen.
I don't advocate rape or torture, but Mark is guilty of lying on a grand scale at least, if not theft, and justice should not turn a blind eye on that.
Anyway, I guess technically you are right -- jail is to keep the public safe. Prison, on the other hand is indeed for punishment, and it is where Karpeles most likely belongs.

Agreed, but still beside the point. My original comment was directed to your assertion:


This was in reference to the target, not DPR. How do we know the target was innocent? And, if the target was not innocent, does this justify the murder attempt? No, I would argue -- because murder is almost always wrong, regardless of the innocence or guilt of the victim.

Yes, mostly because I'm too paranoid to use my wallet and I don't think it's possible to transfer BTC directly to Tradehill.
@_date: 2011-06-25 17:27:59
Right, but then you are presented with a host of options: what kind of encryption? Hidden file or no? Things like that, you know? Maybe they don't make that much of a difference, but who knows?

I bought BTC 60 at around USD 16.50 each. So at the moment I'm up a few dollars. Yay. 
@_date: 2011-06-26 15:54:12
I managed to figure out the instructions in the entry and secure my wallet according to one of the methods described. However certain steps are missing from the instructions, and there are other problems with the instructions, e.g. the method to create the shortcut doesn't seem to work in Windows 7 (I had to use quotation marks, otherwise it would not find "c:/Program". Certainly not everyone is going to figure this all out on their own, regardless of their intelligence. Its really more of a question of computer literacy.
@_date: 2011-07-07 13:28:39
Symbols sometimes lose their meaning in an international context. For example, *$* is generally assumed to mean USD, but other countries use it to denote their currencies as well. And e.g. in Argentina, USD becomes U$. As long as the world cannot agree on symbols for currency, I think it's best to stick to the unique three-letter codes (USD, EUR, BTC) used in international transactions -- after all BTC (theoretically) knows no borders.
@_date: 2011-06-26 04:17:30
Sounds like a great method I would like to follow.
I'm still not sure how to get the BTC from the second wallet to the third, though. 
I imagine while offline you run the client and send BTC to the address of your third wallet on your offline computer (which must somehow be connected to the computer running the client). But how does it receive BTC without downloading the blocks?
Sorry if the answer is too complicated or a bother -- I'm going to keep researching and see if I can figure this all out.
@_date: 2011-06-12 13:05:08
Isn't this the tricky part for bitcoin?
@_date: 2011-06-14 13:45:23
Thanks for taking the step I have been unsure about so far. 
I also would like to accept bitcoins for my business (translation services), but to be honest I'm not certain whether this is the right place to make that announcement (although I suppose I just sort of did).
For those of you who are accepting bitcoins for your business: is there an authoritative directory in which you offer your goods or services? So far I have seen only a couple of lists with few entries.
Also: How you intend to deal with invoicing? I imagine that if the tax authority finds invoices in BTC during an audit, this could mean lots of trouble. So you illegally forgo invoices, declare an equivalent in dollars (and how would one do this with a volatile exchange rate), or what?
@_date: 2011-06-14 13:52:53
Translation and localization services. As a translator who would like to accept bitcoins, it would be wonderful if I could find vendors that accept bitcoins for language combinations that I do not cover.

@_date: 2011-06-12 13:22:31
Certainly bitcoin has established itself to a certain degree -- right now it's around 19 at Mt. Gox, but I think that's beside the point. The current volatility of bitcoins makes it very difficult to take them for goods and services. I would very much like to take bitcoins for translating services, but I have no idea what the bitcoin / number of words ratio should look like since it changes so much. I hope this will change once the speculation phase comes to an end and people start treating bitcoins more like a currency than a commodity. But if a competitor can figure out a way of introducing a more stable digital currency before bitcoin's speculation rollercoaster breaks down, I would imagine that would mean a lot of trouble for bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-20 18:02:43
Thanks! So if I understand correctly, I should just leave the client open (as the number of blocks is increasing) until the BTC show up on my balance, and then close the client until I am ready to use it again.
@_date: 2011-06-26 04:59:54
That makes perfect sense, thanks. Before I thought that the balance somehow showed up on the third wallet by magic, but now it makes sense that it shows up only when you bring it online.
@_date: 2011-06-14 17:55:57
Wouldn't it be safer to keep bitcoins on an exchange until you are ready to use them?
Sorry if that has already been answered a million times.
@_date: 2011-06-16 02:54:05

I would recommend you earn some real coins first. Why try to deal in an digital currency that very few businesses accept at the moment when you apparently have enough trouble making money that everyone accepts? 
Bitcoin is not going away anytime soon, and even if it is, then it's probably nothing you want to be a part of. People with little to no money certainly should not put what they have into a market as volatile as bitcoin's. If you take the time to earn some real cash, maybe the value of bitcoins will stabilize in the meantime, and then you will have more solid footing in both real and digital currency.

As a freelancer working abroad I have to wait for checks from clients to be deposited into my bank account by someone in another country so I can then have someone wire that money overseas at USD 35 per transaction.

@_date: 2011-06-26 02:06:45
Thanks! Just before you posted I did almost exactly that, only instead of your step 6 I created a shortcut and modified its target (as shown in the bitcoin wiki). It seems to have the same result.
I am wondering however whether a hacker would be able to access the wallet if I am online while using a mounted encrypted image. Since I can freely read and write to the volume, couldn't a hacker do the same?
@_date: 2011-06-24 04:38:25
I would have so much more respect for these guys if they would stop setting unrealistic deadlines they can't meet. I know telling the truth in this situation is terrifying, but they really should admit that they have no idea when they will really be opening nor when trading will resume. If I never do business with MtGox again it will not be because of the present security meltdown, it will be because I don't like anyone stringing me along while they buy time. They should take care of their stuff and then set a date and time to re-launch the site, not the other way around.

I'm no economist, but that sounds worrisome to me. As I remember, approximately two years ago the prices rose sharply in part because some person or group of people bought lot of bitcoins at once and then sold them all at what proved to be the peak of their value (i.e. they determined the peak by selling them all), leading to a very sudden plummet in their value.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:50:27

I think the government is too broad of an institution to be addressing first when it comes to bitcoins.
Exactly which members or entities of the government are we talking about? I would say the ones controlled by major financial institutions for which the idea of bitcoin is intolerable.
Not that we shouldn't ignore Washington -- I just think that we need to worry more about Wall Street.
@_date: 2013-06-07 21:44:16
Maybe, but a good portion of it just looks like a circlejerk in the opposite direction. e.g. "my analysis (and hunch) indicates we will head towards 80 in the following months" (of course no methodology behind the analysis is offered). As if anyone knows anything about where it will go.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:53:14
If I understand things correctly, the alternative would be to move the bitcoins to an exchange that doesn't require verification and then to move them to a Dwolla account. Of course then you face the problem of not being able to withdraw anonymously from Dwolla.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:05:51
I tried to cash out using Dwolla and they said no, I would have to verify first.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:20:22
Well I managed to import my wallet into Multibit, and after synchronzing all of the bitcoins showed up. 
Bizarrely at first it showed just less than 1 BTC, which I sent to a MtGox address (so it went back to zero), and then after synchronizing was finished, the full amount from blockchain.info showed up. Meanwhile the just less than 1 BTC hasn't showed up on MtGox, nor do I know where it came from.
Anyway I disconnected the computer from WiFi and will now educate myself about offline storage.
Thank you so much for sharing your technical expertise -- I have learned a lot today.

The writer of the article is describing Stalinism more than anything else. Nothing about socialism in itself requires state coercion. Spain in the 30s saw a successful implementation of socialism from the bottom up until Franco and his cronies destroyed it.
The reason why we rarely see democratic socialism thrive is that moneyed interests forcefully crush such movements before they can become much of a threat to the rich and powerful.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:51:36
I'm probably going to be really unpopular for doing this, but the moment I found out that MtGox shut down trading, I moved my coins to another exchange and sold a good chunk of them as quickly as possible.
I was planning on holding all of them throughout this crisis, but MtGox shutting down was the straw that broke the camel's back. That's certainly no way to inspire confidence in bitcoin. And I'm glad I sold when I did, because tomorrow I imagine the coins will be dirt cheap, and I plan on picking up what I can if they drop much more as I expect.
Edit: I didn't answer your question, because I doubt anyone really knows the answer. My point is that one can still trade by moving to another exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:33:40
Personally I thought blockchain.info looked great until I couldn't access my account because 2-factor authentification mails weren't coming in. Apparently it's a common problem, but it freaked me out enough to import the backup of my wallet into Multibit.
I think my bitcoins were probably fairly safe there, but I opened a ticket a couple of days ago to see whether my account has been compromised and I never heard back from them. So for now I'm keeping my bitcoins off blockchain.info, as much as I like their system.
@_date: 2013-03-22 00:45:35
Indeed it did, but if I remember correctly, even before that when the price reached around USD 35 someone sold a lot of bitcoins and the price plummeted quite a bit. I'm not certain whether today's volume in comparison to 2011 makes bitcoin that much more resistant to pump and dump-style strategies.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:32:05

In 2011 I bought 60 coins for an average of around $16 each. Then I watched the value dive to something like $2.
Two years later I am so glad I held on to them. Sure, I could have bought a lot more at $2, but no one was predicting that severe of a drop. And I feel happy now to have gotten them at $16.

I haven't got a smartphone and I'm in a country where it's very difficult to get them. I'll consider that when I get back to the States, but for now I think offline storage is best for me.

It happened in 2011, and I don't see why it couldn't happen now. 
I'm optimistic about bitcoin, but at the same time wary of market manipulation after I bought bitcoins for USD 20 in 2011 and saw them go down to something like USD 2 very quickly.

After MtGox and Instawallet failing on the same day, I wouldn't consider some cautious selling to be panicking. Not having easy and reliable exchange and storage solutions is certainly not good for bitcoin.

I got in right before the crash in 2011, and I saw my bitcoins go down in value from 16 to something 2 in what I remember was just a few days. Then Tradehill closed without my knowledge, and most of my bitcoins went with them. I considered it more a less a complete loss, with a few measly low-value bitcoins to my name.
Then comes 2013, I hear a lot of hype, see that Tradehill is open again, get all my bitcoins back. Hooray!

Maybe I should point out that I put in $1000 in 2011, so I thought that money was pretty much gone when the price of bitcoins plummeted shortly after I originally bought them.
Now I only have to sell a few bitcoins to get that money back, and I will still have quite a few left over.
Fortunately my order did not go through and I still have all my bitcoins. But the price could have fallen a lot as well, and I still think it was smart of me to want to have some cash on an exchange in order to buy later if the value fell a lot, even if the present evidence indicates otherwise.

I don't see why bitcoin and fiat can't both be useful. My probably overly simplistic view is that bitcoin should gain in value as fiat inflation gets out of control, and if that inflation gets back into control, bitcoin should be seen less as a value retaining instrument and should be spent more freely.
