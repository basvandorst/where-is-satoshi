Gizmodo used to be one of my favorite sites...I don’t go there anymore be of all the Bitcoin hate.

Post some transaction info if you want someone to look at it. Don’t freak out.

Where do you live?

I don’t plan to start selling until about 80k...sell a little every 10k after that until it drops. New ATH is usually a multiple of previous ATH from a couple years before.

This is my story too. I started to buy back before MTG but didn’t...not that it would have mattered by I would have lost it then anyway. 5 yrs ago started to buy again but didn’t...finally started buying and hodling 2 years ago...at least I won’t say “wish I would have” a third time!

Congratulations! Short of one of the few scenarios we aren’t to talk about...looks like this coming year will be the last you “have” to work. I’m just glad that my saving and scrimping the past ten years have put me in a position that I can take advantage somewhat.

For $100 you get roughly 1% of a bitcoin...until you sell or buy something you will keep 1% of a bitcoin...your value vs the dollar (or whatever currency where you’re from) goes up or down. Bitcoin drops to $5,000 and you have $50...goes up to $20,000 and you have $200.

I ALMOST finally bought into some BTC two years ago and didn’t...no good reason, just fear of losing some cash. I don’t want to say the same thing again next year about “if I would have only!” I’m putting in enough that I’ll either work an extra year or retire ten years sooner...I’ll take that risk

Do you expect an organized sell off at a future date after Dec 11, or will it happen on the 11th as soon as they can place their futures orders? I don’t really know much about futures.

Same. HODL until I can pay BTC outright for the home we want.

I saw the price dropping and came here to see if something happened...

Only thing that I have seen in real life that can partially justify these high interest rates is the fact that what happens in reality it’s not that people with bad credit get lower interest loans, but that people with bad credit get no loans. North Carolina has a similar interest rate cap on auto loans, and what happens is the banks end up charging $2000 to $5000 fees upfront to do the loan. Now it’s technically illegal for the auto dealers to pass that fee onto the customer, so if they don’t have anyway to hide the fee it just means that the customer ends up having to go to a buy here pay here lot, or driving to a nearby state to purchase their car there. 
Once we get over the eight year growing pain of breaking the cycle, these interest-rate caps would be a good thing. And the reality is most of the people that have low income and bad credit should be relying more on Uber then their own vehicle anyway.
