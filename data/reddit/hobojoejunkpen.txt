Then leave the discussion.

Since you bought something for $250, why would you not buy it at 50? By definition the bottom is what seems like the worst possible time to buy, when the market has no respect for an asset. On the other hand, when optimism takes over and it actually seems like a good time to buy is by definition the best point to sell. It pays to be a contrarian.

Jesus fucking Christ, someone finally brought up value-investing. Before you buy any more bitcoins, read Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor. He is probably the most conservative voice out there and taught Buffet's night school class at Columbia. Whether you decide to speculate after you read that is up to you, but please read this book.
Also, Graham lived 1894-1976 so he has no agenda. Its just good investing advice.

I think you have a correlation causation problem. Milton Friedman actually showed that deflation to the extent that real interest rates were 0 was the optimal state. Look up the Friedman rule.

Here here. Whenever people stop listening to Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffets lessons about finding value, these types of bubbles seem to follow.

Your comment makes very little sense. Loans with bitcoins would work in the exact same way that loans with any currency work.

Or not trying to time the market and buying your position a fifth at a time.

Why all the hostility against HFT? Every trade they make is with a real person who's agreeing to terms. Everyone else who trades with them is just as responsible for the consequences of the trade. Trouble is, people don't trade on fundamental valuations because they don't know how. In that case, you're buying at some arbitrary level and selling at some arbitrary level and then complaining when someone does the same thing at non-arbitrary levels.

More exchanges with greater independence will only create more arbitrage opportunities.

How does thinking about the price of bitcoins as an inverse bubble give you any insights into how the price will behave? If you're asking if things will oversell, probably. However, since you don't know where the bottom is, it doesn't matter.
