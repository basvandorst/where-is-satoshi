The scams and frauds get the most attention because people love drama. The reality is that, just like in the fiat economy, there are a few bad actors willing to screw everyone else for their own personal gain. For every gox, input.io and bitfloor, there are ten Coinbases, BitPays and Bitstamps. The majority of businesses are good, honest entrepreneurs, and they are the ones who will prevail in a truly free market.

I do that too! I make purchases more often when the price seems high (I bought a brand new TV and speakers when it was over $1000) and I replenish on coinbase when the price seems low (most recently during the Gox madness when it was at $590).
This is the nature of bitcoin; you benefit most when you time the market right. Some people see this as a serious flaw, but for me it kinda turns money into a "game" in itself. Volatility can be fun!

Things like multisig escrow, seller reputations and arbiters will serve to protect the buyer. If a seller doesn't deliver then neither does the escrow, and everyone on the marketplace knows it.

Dude. Bitcoin websites going up in flames is nothing new, it's just that Gox is the most high-profile example so far. I don't think that this failure would significantly sway the media that already used Silk Road and input.io as the obituary for bitcoin. Quit being so afraid of media criticism. Being in bitcoin means you need a thick skin.
As for people losing their money, yeah that sucks. I feel for you; I personally lost 0.53 BTC when bitfloor.com went down in April 2012 and that loss only pissed me off more as the price quadrupled. But I got over it and learned not to store my coins on third-party websites, not even Coinbase. I don't put unnecessary trust in these companies.
There were signs a long time ago that something shady was going on at Gox, but people continued to use it anyway. It's your fault for not evaluating your third-party websites better, and when you're using an infant technology like Bitcoin you need to realize that the infrastructure is rough around the edges, and not losing money means being careful about which *parts* of the structure you interact with.
tl;dr Gox is a piece of shit, hopefully you learn not to do business with pieces of shit.

I'm referring to how Republicans in Congress, specifically those in the House, continuously take the extreme side of issues and refuse to compromise. Getting them to back down on an issue, even a little bit, is seen as a huge victory for Democrats.
It's a similar strategy that Lawsky is using against the BTC community, by putting out an extreme set of rules and making it seem like a victory for us when he eventually waters it down.
As for the two parties, both sides are NOT the same thing. Republicans in government are significantly more dangerous than Democrats, and I'm not afraid to make that claim. It's not true 100% of the time, but for the most part it's accurate.
That being said, you're right that both sides are doing damage in their own ways. They're both fundamentally anti-free market and only concerned with protecting their own influence. And the vast majority of them implicitly support the current campaign finance system which has turned corruption on overdrive.
Ben Lawsky's political affiliation really couldn't be more irrelevant -- either way he's just working for the old system of banks and cronies.

Some clarifications:
* This is an act that modifies section 107 of the Corporations Code of California. It is not a standalone, comprehensive regulatory bill.
* It passed the CA assembly on January 29 but is not official law until the senate passes it as well. Right now it's sitting in the senate committee on banking and financial institutions.
* There's one clause in the act that may cause a problem for bitcoin in the future:


* If bitcoin ever gets big enough where people are pricing goods and services *solely* in BTC without using a USD exchange rate, AB-129 will not necessarily protect bitcoin.
Those caveats aside, this is a great step in the right direction, and it's a sign that California state politicians don't have their heads completely buried in the ground.

Whether or not its appropriate to have rules in a given industry really depends on what that industry is doing. I think most people are more open to the idea of having their food supply regulated vs how they interact with their money. If you get burned in bitcoin, the most you've lost is whatever fiat you used to buy in. But if you get burned by the food industry, you can get sick or even die.
So the usefulness of rules depends on the particular industry, and its really unclear at this point if rules for Bitcoin (proposed in the BitLicense and elsewhere) would have enough benefit to outweigh negative effects, such as increasing corruption and a chilling effect on legitimate but underfunded upstarts.

Well, there was someone on reddit who talked about Bitstamp issues as early as 5 months ago, and I talked about it for a [podcast]( 4 months ago.
But those concerns were mainly based on reports of delayed withdrawals, and nobody really knew the exact method Bitstamp was using to secure their hot wallet. Hindsight is 20/20 and now we see there was a serious security hole.
If you want to trade, there are some good exchanges out there which seem very professional. I'm not a trader myself so I can't speak from personal experience.
The thing is, pretty much anyone can be hacked. Whether it's the NSA, Apple, Sony, or Bitstamp -- if they have valuable files on a server, then that's a big target for hackers.
Bitcoin traders should just learn to *always* withdraw their BTC from the exchange and into a secure local wallet, when they are done trading for the day. It's so cheap (3 cents) and so easy with the tools we have now, that it should be a no-brainer.

You're just wrong on this point, or you're using a different definition of "fork" than the one used by Bitcoin developers.
This hypothetical altcoin has completely different code than Bitcoin. It is not related to the bitcoin core code **whatsoever** besides being a cryptocurrency. If you still call that a type of fork, you're distorting the meaning of something very specific in the world of software development.
Read up on what a fork actually is. It's taking the original software code and making modifications that require current network participants to make a choice on which side to pick. That's why the discussion of hard forks creates so much friction in the community.
What I'm trying to explain (and obviously failing in this instance) is that there's a way to create a separate blockchain (an altcoin) that distributes initial coins according to who can prove ownership of a certain amount of bitcoin.
This is not *any* type of fork of the bitcoin network because miners don't have to choose between bitcoin and the new coin. It's just an altcoin that copies Bitcoin's current distribution.
Edit: did some more reading myself and maybe the definition of fork has morphed over time. I thought that a fork involved basically the same code with modest changes; if it also includes *any* chain that simply starts with the same unspent outputs, then that is news to me.
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:22:25

"The Bitcoin network" isn't ambiguous at all if you look at how mining works. Essentially all the miners and nodes together constitute the Bitcoin network. Yes it's slightly different code than it was years ago, but it's still undeniably the same network, just older and bigger.


Yes, that's the whole point. It's a new blockchain, a new network, a new **altcoin**. It's entirely separate from the continuing bitcoin network and doesn't affect it in any way.

@_date: 2015-01-12 05:46:05
Yes, I see now. The definition of a hardfork has apparently changed since I first researched it in 2012. It no longer matters if it uses the same codebase as the original chain. It just needs to start with the original **ledger** and that's enough to classify as a hardfork.
At least that's what everyone is telling me. I was under the impression that a hardfork has to use the same overall code &amp; algorithm.

The New York Times is concern-trolling here. If they were really this worried about dark, untraceable money flowing into election campaigns, they would do more stories on Super PACS and mega-wealthy donors like the Koch brothers who plan on sinking $1 billion+ into the campaign next year. That money is coming from regular old bank accounts, and while it may be technically traceable, the PACS are not required to disclose their donors. So in effect it is anonymous.
But here's the New York Times pretending to be concerned that bitcoin donations to Rand Paul (which are capped at $100 and must be attached to a donor's identity) will increase the problem of dark money in politics. Yeah, right.

Most of the violence in the drug trade occurs between low-level dealers and their high-level suppliers -- not between the dealers and users.
So the fact that supplier/dealer trades happen over the internet drastically reduces the violence that normally happens between gangs and cartels, even if the product ends up getting sold on the street anyway.

1. It's not an update to the code, it's just changing the naming scheme. Like if the penny became the new dollar.
2. You'd see all kinds of people jumping into the game now that they can buy a bitcoin for $1.02. You wouldn't see any major sell-offs because a) the people paying attention would know what the switch means and b) even if they don't understand the switch, they still won't want to sell off at $1.02.

That solution is even more complicated because then you're constantly dealing with exchange rates, inflation of the fiat, hundreds of different national currencies, and its just not an elegant solution at all.
Of course its better than what we have now, and its probably how the markets are going to work during the next few years, but *eventually* I do see Bitcoin taking over as the main global currency.
At that point we'll need a better way of discussing transactions than
"I just sent you 0.000065 bitcoins, did you get them?"
"No I only got 0.0000065 coins."
"Oh my bad, that's what I meant to write."

SR transactions would never be in a top address because a single dealer just can't make that many sales in a short amount of time, and a buyer can't make that many purchases.

The developers have been looking into lowering transaction fees, and the pressure on them will be even greater with this latest run up.
As for confirmation time, I'm not sure if there's a solution for this on the horizon. I do know that many individuals and presumably merchants are willing to accept transactions with 0 confirmations and this is still relatively secure.
These are valid points and will need to be addressed by the developers very soon.

It's a good idea, but I would suggest writing a short bio of your son and putting it on the Tumblr site. Maybe throw up a picture too. People want to know what they're donating toward; What are your son's career goals? How does he hope to change the world? If you make him sound awesome enough (but still truthful) you'll probably start pulling in donations from charitable strangers.
Just my 2 cents, hope it works out for you!

Let's do it. We should think of a catchy name for this movement and spread it everywhere.
I know we won't convince everyone, or even most people, but once enough start doing it, the practice will just catch on. It's just a matter of semantics and we need to make the change while we're still in the early days.

So is the card sold at a set dollar price and the amount of BTC awarded is determined at time of purchase? Or is it in a BTC denomination but the dollar amount is determined at the register? I like the idea of Joe being able to buy coins at 7-11, I just don't understand the logistics you're describing.

Wow. TIL it's stupid easy to get a loan. Now I just need to get a job.

There are alt-coins out there that satisfy your desires perfectly. Go buy them. Bitcoin's underlying system has proven its resilience already and it's not going to be changed.

I thought it was a very interesting article, even if the only reference to Bitcoin is tangential.

If someone actually made this, they would make a FORTUNE. This is just the kind of awesome killer app that can attract mainstream users.

Multibit is fine, just make sure you back up the wallet.dat file and keep the client, and your computer, password protected.

It would be interesting to know what percentage of the U.S. population actually owns Bitcoins (Gallup should do a poll on that) but I agree it must be lower than 2.5% putting us, strangely, still in the innovator phase. The notion that we haven't even reached early adopter phase yet is mind-boggling.

I know it would be confusing, but only for a while before everyone in the community gets used to it. We can still do it now because we're in the early adopter stage.
The benefits would be massive in terms of bitcoin's public perception. Nobody wants to buy a tenth of a bitcoin for $20 and they don't want to spend $200 for one unit of this new currency.
Making this change would cause Bitcoin to seem more like currency and less like an asset, and this change is crucial for stimulating the economy.

I have 0.56032 Bitcoins stuck on their site. Not much, but as a college student it still sucks.

This is the answer I was scared of. These people do have the power to ruin the whole thing, and we're putting our trust in them.
@_date: 2013-10-19 10:23:45
Wow, thanks for my first tip.
And yes, that's a very good point. I'd love to see the coin reach $1,000 but I'd much rather see it reach $1 while I have 1,000x more of them than I did before. It just seems rational for a real currency to work like this.

Any update on this?

This is the breast typo ever.

So that was basically saying we should use mBTC as the main denomination, which is happening anyway because of the market. Still doesn't address the fact that an actual Bitcoin costs almost as much as an Xbox 360.
edit: I read more into that thread, and axefrog put it perfectly:

I think they can handle it when they've read up on how Bitcoin works and gotten familiar with it, and probably after they already bought some coins.
But for the people who are turned off by the term "millibits" they won't even consider buying any, and won't even get the chance to talk in those terms. It's basically bad marketing for Bitcoin.
