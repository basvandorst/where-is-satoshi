Deflation encourage savings but paralyzes the economy, which results in less jobs, less products manufactured, less services offered, and ultimately no GDP growth. Deflation is what killed the Japanese economy in the 90s.
For any economy to grow, money needs to circulate so that value is created. Bitcoin does not create much value at the moment, but it could when it is massively adopted and its price &amp; fees stabilize. 
Finally, I believe the reason no one is saving enough for the future is because they can't. The middle class is disappearing. People have less money to save at the end of the month after accounting for all expenses. I believe the main contributing factors are:
* **Higher debt**: Student loans alone are up 6% from last year. These loans cripple the American citizen even before he/she starts working. [Americans owe over $1.4 trillion in student loan debt, spread out among about 44 million borrowers]( That's about $620 billion more than the total U.S. credit card debt. 
* **Higher Housing &amp; health costs increased BUT stagnant income**:[Housing]( and [healthcare]( have become more expensive in the last few years but the average [American household income peaked in 1999]( and hasn't been back up to the 57$K mark since then.
