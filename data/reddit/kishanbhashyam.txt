21mil in total (many lost and un-recoverable).. Once awareness increases, even 1 BTC will be highly sought after. But, it wont happen tomorrow.. To reach to that stage, it will take 100+ years (considering BTC is still in circulation) -- PS - i am sitting with 12BTC..

Cold storage is the answer. 
Have a machine that is off the internt (or even a Raspberry pi) and store your coins there. 
Or, buy some physical bitcoins and fund them with your coins. Then dig a pit in your garden and berry them 6 feet under :P

I bought a cryobit card (similar to your product).
It came with the Private and Public key printed on the card. I am not sure of the safety as it might have touched many hands before it got to me. Secondly manufacturers of these kind of products might have a ledger with all the private and its public keys... Scarry!!!

a very low (really low) transaction fee is 'one of the beauties' of what makes BTC what it is. Bringing on transaction fee (where miners profit) will only kill BTC..  
@_date: 2014-12-03 02:03:40
Reason being? Reduced number of mining power?
@_date: 2014-12-08 23:05:07
Hmm Interesting. Cool.

Why cant i run the whole node on a virtual machine \ Linux computer and do the same job as this device?

When people say Bigger Block size, do you mean 1 Block=25BTC at the moment ---- so Bigger would be 1 Block&gt;25BTC?

Is this a todays setup? OR some years ago? If it is a todays setup,  i presume it is setup to solo mine for fun? i have a few of these lying around along with a few other varieties of SHA256 USB errupters.. Looking at solo mining too

Have you updated the firmware? Your Trezor seed should be more than 12 words. More like 24.

Dont be such a hater mate! I dont think his intent was to ever prove himself cool.

firstly Mt GOX never lost 850 million bitcoins.. FALSE info
@_date: 2015-04-23 21:13:11
Correct.. I store mine in a distributed way.

CEX.IO is one exchange that accepts credit cards. Although, you might have to go through their KYC process before you start buying BTC's there..  
@_date: 2015-04-23 08:54:47
Sorry, wasn't aware..! What happened to Bter? I used to trade DOGE there months ago..!
@_date: 2015-04-22 22:16:19
Green=7 and Red=30 does the trick... Found it through another forum :) .. Cheers
@_date: 2015-04-24 06:52:45
Cex.io is ok to buy.. i wouldn't place my miners on ghash
@_date: 2015-04-23 20:59:40
Hmm Interesting. Is it funds that were in order or funds that were stored into the wallet. They should have performed cold storage on coins that were not under order?
