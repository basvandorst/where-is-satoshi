Did not realize that they did. Funny though and in depth. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:45:46
Um, these don’t even have the B logo. Garbage.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:35:33
Ripple seems to be advancing fast. People love those centralized coins!
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:42:44
The media hates BTC but seems to love Ethereum.

They warned us to stay off the exchanges then last minute it says if I had my Bitcoin balance in Bittrex I would have had an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash. Seriously. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:34:50
Nobody cares until something becomes popular. Human nature. You have to believe in yourself and not try to convince negative people to be interested in what you are doing. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:21:36
So can someone make a prediction on the future of original Bitcoin? Will BCH take over? It's sky rocketing like crazy. Personally I wanna keep original Bitcoin but now I am pissed! Everyone said stay off exchanges and I did. Missed the boat for free BCH on Bittrex WTF. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:25:15
It makes me sick that in 2009 I didn't buy more. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:53:27
This whole thing is insanity
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:57:39
So do we sell or what, can't seem to get an answer. I am like WTF at this point. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:06:41
Thanks for generally caring about me ��
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:54:20
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:42:31
A Lambo would be a bit more convincing ��
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:24:44
Nice guy, met him once through a relative. He is working on his own ICO actually (advisor role) 
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:58:50
Does it make more sense to just lease a Lambo? 
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:20:42
Because I said let's hope he is right? Ok Nostradamus you know it all. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:32:42
If you have a Brass pair go for it. WTF knows what will happen. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:52:11
LMAO I actually have met this guy several times 
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:20:50
This is about belief in the future of BTC. If you are trying to save $50, you just don't understand shit about it. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:13:04
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:57:00
Let's hope so, with the Segwit crap coming up.. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:04:28
So does this mean I need to sell my original Bitcoins? The media keeps writing about how Bitcoin will have to compete with it's clone now which would lower the price. Yes? No? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:24:00
Good, let them raise it's value through this article. We all want it to go up. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:24:37
They are not gonna return bro, did you read that the miners chose BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:01:20
This is why Coinbase should not be the centralized place to buy BTC. Coinbase Mafia. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:00:10
20K BTC 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:57:06
I think it looks like this is serious bro, people are moving to bch
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:05:58
Then why is everyone buying bch
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:03:35
This is insane
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:01:11
Ok BCH proponents  are saying the Bitcoin Segwit is controlled by corporations and banks...
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:59:39
How is Roger Ver sketchy 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:10:07
Does he own 100,000 BTC? He seems sincere though about his Liberterian views, not like a scammer. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:29:53
Roger Very is hard behind BCH. The hardcore BTC people apparently moved over to BCH loyalist (it's a political thing) they claim the Segwit BTC (they call it segshit) is centralized. They say BCH is not centralized. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:39:11
Yes nobody is psychic but we do know BTC is genius, and very limited. It will never go to 0 sorry. Let's revisit this post in a year. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:11:56
What if I move my life savings in fiat into BTC for short term and sell it when it hits 20K? Still stupid? I feel really bullish on BTC future and yes I keep reading about competitors like Vertcoin etc I don't feel threatened at all by them. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:50:23
Why am I rich ? 20K is not that much
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:48:38
600 not enough brah
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:28:51
Yes I am aware of that, I have been to Africa. We are not discussing the haves and have nots right now this is an investment question. Also, you do not know shit about my background or how hard it was to get that money.

How old are you? If you are 15 I understand. 30+ I would hope you speed up your hustle. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:32:02
It's all about instincts, you develop these by asking lots of questions. Once you get a feeling you know what moves to make. You say don't ask reddit, so who do you ask? An accredited investor? Am I Nostradamus and know it all already? Asking questions is vital to success. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 05:05:26
Yeah HODL a quality coin, not all these shit coins and white papers. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:52:46
Will I get airdrop if it's on my Ledger?

The old bitcoiner days are over 
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:32:55
Ah don't worry guys your favorite celebs will be tweeting daily about their favorite coins sooner or later. Personally I like the underground aspect of crypto but whatever floats your boat. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:34:07
Good tips but not really new to Bitcoin. I've been following it since 2011. But unfortunately did not buy massives volumes back then as I thought it was shit to buy drugs online with. I am aware of the volatility just trying to develop a better gut decision. The forks are also questionable. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:42:30
Who cares
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:09:40
Can I use a CD ROM 
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:37:35
Next year. Apple and all these companies will put a little bitcoin button as a payment method. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:52:57
I am strictly into Crypto and do not invest in Stocks
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:48:50
I am not rich, 20K is my max left for all investments. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:37:59
I spoke with a spotify employee-its been confirmed they are working on their own blockchain
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:06:52
I love Crypto 
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:10:26
Yeah and they probably have hidden cameras watching those brah. Don't under estimate the powers that be. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:16:01
Most people do not know in Japan? Hard to believe 
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:11:21
I agree. Lots of people are aware of Bitcoin. Maybe non social types who never leave think it's underground still. My girlfriends mom is 54 and has Bitcoin, I met a 95 year old lady who told me she invested in Bitcoin, some random college girl says she has 3, Best Buy employees who sell cameras and tv's are dabbling in it. Not that secret as hardcore Bitcoiners want it to be. Most people do not own an entire Bitcoin but part of one. I am hearing tons of Litecoin talk from less sophisticated types. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:11:44
Yeah and they ask for your ID and all of that bullshit. GTFOH. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:35:15
See it shows humans still have a desire to feel and hold their money. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:12:50
Well its only a matter of time before celebs get involved. Ashton Kutcher with Civic, Mark Cuban Unikoin, "THE GAME" sponsoring Paragon, its ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:34:03
As a former graphic artist take off the BitcoIn logo and keep it more for in the know people.

Bicqlo? What is this
@_date: 2017-09-07 05:04:22
Sounds like an ICO wrote this to get a pump. I know which one.

2-5 ICO's per month are solid the rest are assholes trying to rip everyone off 
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:05:25
Yes it's funny how so many people use flip phones in Tokyo I noticed this. I love the Blade Runner feel though.
