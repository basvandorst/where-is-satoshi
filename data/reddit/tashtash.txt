Doge as well... Do we bring out the champagne or what?

Because his link made me giggle. I was looking for an excuse to try it out.

No, just one. I'm not local, and don't want to use express post to pay, so I've gotta wait.

I really wish my bank was supported for interac online, otherwise this would of been the way to go! 
Thanks a bunch!

No love for Canada?
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:42:09
This is the coolest thing ever.

They keep shooting us down... Gyft and snap card are not working in Canada and international shipping is usually = or more that the items cost. 
Plus, no local business besides tax attorneys near me... 
Im trying to use it, I promise!

I use Cibc, they aren't accepting interac online so I can't use this site :( 
Too bad, really, it seems easy as pie.

No problem. Now I'm curious... Why'd you ask? Lol

OP must be sitting his pants today. I made a teeny tiny buy last week (0.09) and now it's worth 20$ more and im going apeshit.

This feels sketchy 
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:49:04
Yeah, I'm not sure how valid this is. I placed a "test" order and almost immediately got an email from Yanni rejecting it saying they are working on it.

It was mutual, you just took my tip cherry. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:13:12
Thanks! Waiting for my verif call and I'll be buying :)
