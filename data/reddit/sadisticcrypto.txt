How is Tether an Omni Layer to BTC, they are separate - Cool a lot of people back Tether against Bitcoin but they do that with so many other tokens as well. Am i mistaken?

be careful dont get yourself in financial difficulty because you FOMO, investing in alts is basically investing in BTC with the potential of a higher ROI if you pick the right one.

When someone wants to buy large amounts i prefer they use normal exchanges, let them increase the price lol BUT when your selling large it gotta be a OTC service.

What is this post claiming to know?  All i see is me posting a positive large buy order.. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:48:15
The spoofing is done by bots and every exchange has bots on them, But those Bot trades last seconds they dont set long standing buy orders.

Over the counter \- A private option direct between seller and buyer. Normally used when large amounts are involved.

Commodities are the future, WHEN the whole finance industry collapse's everyone is going to get into commodities and if Crypto is ready then i expect Crypto to fall under that bracket. But mostly Gold \- Silver etc. Europe is on the brink of collapse already.

Sorry for the delayed response but spot-on, Honestly if we are young we need to risk it we have time to make it back, if you have kids a family bills etc of course you gotta be more responsible.
Like you said, just think about it you put what lets say 50K into this, You lose 50k OK its not much that amount wont really change your life cant even buy you a nice car let alone a house. BUT if the market does go how we expect it to go that 50K has probably just made you a millionaire.
 That risk/reward distribution is really unheard off, unless your rigging the bookies. Thats why sometimes you gotta think why are some of these Billionaires so sour towards this market, Ill be sour as well if i worked my ass off to get that money, and here comes a market in its early years potentially creating the most millionaires/billionaires ever from a market Boom, people who havent done 1/100th of what they have done will be living the same Lux life.
But be certain many will blow it away just like most lottery winners, dont be one of them.

Trust me these people are complete idiots.. Do they think this is a charity they are basically asking the SEC to pump the market

ETF is not 1/20th as important as lighting? Please do you even know what a ETF is? Do you Know what a ETF would mean to Bitcoin?.... Thats highly concerning if people really dont know the importance of a ETF and the influx of capital such a thing will bring.

Your Comparing a billonaires 1% with a normal persons? If a normal person put 1% of their Networth into this what are they really expecting back? 
\- Your right people need to be responsible but you cant compare him to normal people.
