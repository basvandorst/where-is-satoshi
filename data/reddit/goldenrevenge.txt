I know it depends on everyone’s individual situation but what is the rule of thumb with how much to put in every paycheck (for example)? 5%, 10%? Compared to traditional investment like money markets, stocks and etc.

Question: Let’s say I buy 2btc @ 10k for $20k. A month later when bitcoin is at 12k I move the $24k to a new address, my hardware wallet. A month later bitcoin is at 14k and I buy a boat from a friend or business. I transfer the 28k to their address. 
All in all I have made two moves of bitcoin, one to my personal address and another to an outside address. Who’s not to say that I just moved the money to another one of my addresses and not actually made a purchase of a boat from another party? How would they know who’s address belongs to who.

I could have chosen I better word, I didn’t mean spinoff in the sense of the hard fork,

Yea I have some money in bitcoin and a small amount of money in 10 or so alt coins. I am not putting any more money into alts and have an automatic transfer setup to buy bitcoin each paycheck.

Today I can buy a loaf of bread for $5. If all the sudden the government decides to print money like there is no tomorrow that same loaf of bread might cost $20, $100, $10,000. What is happening in Venezuela right now is the perfect example, just do a quick google search. That’s why it is significant that there will never be more than 21,000,000 bitcoin, we are unable to add more to decrease the value of each. Does that make sense?

They could have said it nicer, but at the end of the day, you are going up computers and insanely intelligent algorithms that are lightning fast when it comes to day trading. 
Some people want to buy but don’t and wait and wait then forget and then a few years later bitcoin is x10 in price, and regret is common. So all he is saying is if you want to invest you should do some research, determine if the risk level is something you are comfortable with and then just hold onto it and hang out for the ride.

Lost private key = lost coins. Fact.

It’s all about to how risk you can afford. In general, younger people can take more risk (we have less money at our disposal and we have the great majority of our working career ahead of us) and older people can take less risk (they have more to lose monetary wise and they are nearing the end of their working life so if they are risky with their money and lose it, it would be devastating for their financial future).
Here are a few examples of less risky to more risky:
Treasury bond (almost no risk on losing money, but you make very little money on this investment)
Mutual fund
Bitcoin (most risky investment).
If you lost the $500 would it do anything to your lifestyle? Would you miss rent if it was gone? If the consequences are small, shoot for the moon and go for it, you are young and $500 is a drop in the bucket of how much money you will make in your lifetime.

My plan is to DCA, however I am going to keep some designated usd on the side for a potential lump sum to bitcoin. If bitcoin goes up then I’m not going to do the lump sum because that would increase my DCA but if bitcoin goes down low enough then I’ll throw in the lump sum because this will lower my DCA. 
It’s all about balance.
@_date: 2019-07-13 21:31:43
Agree with this. I have a Trezor and it’s been seamless.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:19:48
I would wait a few weeks tbh, this may not be the bottom at all, but then again it could. You never know
@_date: 2019-07-07 10:48:58
Precisely, it’s a balancing act between supply and demand

A few weeks ago I put a reminder in my calendar for the end of April to remind myself to look at bitcoin in case it slips my mind for a few months hah
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:26:47
Agree with this. The question basically boils down to how long do you think it will take to mine bitcoin worth the amount you can buy today, then factor in costs such as electricity and your own time.
Everyone is trying to make a buck so you paying retail price is how they make a buck. If mining were actually more profitable more people would do it.

Currently everyone refers to every other cryptocurrency as “shitcoins” because they are all spinoffs of bitcoin. Bitcoin has always been the largest of them all but who knows how long that will last. Some people do bounce between coins to try and make money but they will likely do it much better than you unless (unfortunately that is the reality of it). We hardly win when we try and day trade unless you are going all out and live and breathe it (same with the stock market).

Can confirm binance has many alt coins. Easy to set up. I transferred BTC over there pretty quickly, Bought an alt coin and transferred it out into myetherwallet no problem.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:01:32
That is a linear solution to an exponential problem. Raising block size offers temporary relief. Not a long term solution.

I have some money in Coinbase with BTC LTC and ETH. Is it safe to keep them there? They give me the ability to use a vault where either 2 of 3 (or 3 of 5) people that are close to me need to verify any transaction before it can be made. This seems pretty safe to me, or am I mistaken?

What is the profit on oil?

You literally asked this question 10 minutes ago.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:08:59
They do charge a fee and when moving money I do know that. But it should have told you what the fee was going to be before you transfer. I think I paid a dollar and change to move $40. It could be that they charged a $2.84 fee and then over the next 10 minutes the price moved down so that’s why you have $4.97.  And I think the more you send the lower the rate.

I’m still trying to figure out number 2! My money has just been sitting on CB for a month

Even if it went to $1m / bitcoin you currently could only make about 20x on your money (don't get me wrong this would be amazing, but long gone are the days of turning $20 into millions)
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:34:34
This would be a very interesting project
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:33:33
I purchased some  Per bitcoin and some more at  Per bitcoin so I sure hope it will continue going up.
At the end of the day the million dollar question is, “where is the money flowing?” Because the price is solely dependent on how much money is in bitcoin. The amount of bitcoin will never exceed 21,000,000 so if more and more people become interested in bitcoin and see the value that will mean an increase in value because it’s more dollars flowing into bitcoin rather than flowing out of bitcoin.

To answer your question, whatever value your bitcoins are worth at the time just subtract 3000 and that will be your profit.
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:19:42
Oops bad math, thanks for the correction, that is a sweet profit indeed, but my main point was that, that’s only if bitcoin soaks up every dollar of value in the world which would be virtually impossible. But now that I realize the max is 200x it gives much more room for impressive gains

Gold is just another way to diversify. I was just making the case that gold has the qualities of being a great median for storing money, and I think bitcoin also falls into that category.

@_date: 2019-09-01 23:32:47
Totally agree with you! Comments on your volatility comment 
 While this is true (100% gains), I don’t think this is necessarily an indication of a long term store of wealth, more like early adopters that have been rewarded thus far. For example, Enron was thought to be an amazing company for years and years and we all know how that turned out so even though years went by without error, all the dominos still fell.
@_date: 2019-09-02 02:44:26
This is very true, it has stood the test of time because it has been reliable enough. I can only hope that bitcoin will be able to withstand such ups and downs.
@_date: 2019-09-02 00:50:02
I agree! And I think this validates bitcoins presence in the global economy.

Interestingly enough gold, for the majority of its existence, was regulated by governments/rulers.
@_date: 2019-09-02 02:19:08
Point being, flood the market with goal increases supply which decreases demand and decreases price.
@_date: 2019-09-02 02:09:48
This is true, introduce new amounts of gold (or anything that holds value) and the price per unit will decrease. Same thing with diamonds. There are enormous of privately held diamonds, but they are not all released into the market at once because then they would be worthless rocks. Release small amounts at a time and that are worth a lot.
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:27:37
Well that’s the nature of what profit is. Profit is the value of your account minus your initial investment. Only time will tell if bitcoin will go up or go down.
@_date: 2019-09-03 21:40:03
This sounds interesting, I’ll do some research as to where to start but in the meantime would you be able to point me in the right direction as to where to find info on how to write a blockchain parser? I’m not sure where to do this.

I agree, since speculation is the name of the game now there is a bunch of fluctuation and later in the game when it’s more considered a global currency it will be less volition, because it has to if it actually wants to be considered a global currency
