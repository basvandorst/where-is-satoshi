It doesn't though if we're talking about electricity, which we were... 
Look, if you want your ISP to dictate to you what you can and cannot do with your Internet connection, which appears to be what you are suggesting, then fine... It's an opinion.

That's exactly my point. You need both if you want to have a healthy internet.
I use a small ISP that is very vocal about issues like net neutrality and government monitoring, because the free market here allows that to exist, and I also appreciate the fact that no ISP is able to choose what it's customers can and cannot see on the internet because the law prohibits that.
A hard position for one or the other side of the argument here is purely ideological, not practical. A free market for ISPs and open internet for everyone is the goal.
The security point you raise is a good one, and is best highlighted by the UK. The ISPs there cannot throttle content, but the gov has forced them all to log all user's web history. This is abhorrent, but not relevant to the discussion about Net Neutrality or the market for ISPs as it would be the same regardless.
EDIT: Also, I agree that blind trust in government (or corporations) is naive, but I wasn't arguing for that. I don't hold any extreme ideological positions, but there are also many examples of the EU defending consumers against the interests of the corporations which you don't see in the likes of the US. Nothing is perfect.

Electricity, water, anything that is a critical service required to survive at a decent standard of living in modern society. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:10:03
Electricity ownership? An asset? What are you talking about? You are not buying electricity, you are paying the service provider for the operating costs in delivering it to your house, and some profit. They don't have any say in what you do with that electricity and why should they?
I pay my ISP for access to the Internet, it's not part of the deal that they can dictate to me what I do with it. Now in other countries that have healthy ISP competition you don't have to worry about Net Neutrality so much, but in the US it's critical issue because you also have monopolies on the service, it's a fucking mess and has nothing at all to do with where you buy your milk.

You didn't, but we weren't getting anywhere so I reversed the argument.
So it's bad for individuals, but good for private companies? I'll side with the individuals then.

They probably shouldn't be allowed to only power your washing machine and the lights in 2 rooms though and charge you extra if you want to watch TV or boil some water...
Its a service not a product and you are paying them to provide it, not parts of it.

Yeah I'm not violently against it to be fair, I'm a software engineer by trade, and sure we occasionally hack something in as a temporary fix, but this hack is being presented as an actual solution and that bothers me.
What 'the vast majority of people' do isn't a very strong argument when we're talking about technology worth billions. It's what quality engineers would do that counts, and this doesn't feel like a quality engineering solution to the very real scaling problem.
I will say that LN etc has issues too. At this point we have to choose between the lesser of evils, and at a high level, this is a cause for concern for all crypto.

It really is this simple.

Apples and oranges again, with a healthy dose of strawman. 
Were not getting anywhere here. If you're still interested, convince me how allowing ISPs to divide the Internet up (I'll drop 'dictate') is good for consumers. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:56:17
Did you just compare Internet access to buying milk and expect anyone to take you seriously.
I mean we use "apples and oranges" to discredit poor comparisons but I'm up for changing it to "milk and Internet" now.

No, I'm saying that I care more about individuals rights than corporations ones. So whenever those are in conflict, I will support the individuals' cause.
Moral equivalence between people and corporations is a travesty. They are not equals. Corporations are not "persons" and should not have the same rights as people. That they do in certain jurisdictions is what is repugnant.

I totally agree that the monopoly situation is a problem in the US. However granting 'the internet' a special status that means no private business can arbitrarily throttle parts of it is good for everyone.
Here in Europe we have a *much* healthier ISP market AND Net Neutrality enshrined in law. The result is much cheaper, faster, un-throttled internet for everyone. 
You can, and should, have both, and that means some involvement from government. The free market alone cannot provide everything and to think it can is naive.

Your response is essentially "fake news"?
Grow up.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:20:48
It's early, but I seriously doubt I'll see more spectacular mental gymnastics today.
I think we're done here. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:19:51
No no, I understand, i just disagree.
There isn't one easy answer to a complex issue like this.

There is no on-chain solution for this problem that will work in perpetuity as far as I know. 
Increasing block size is just kicking the can down the road a bit.

Very good point, but it's still early days in the Internet vs traditional media battle and be honest, in 50 years can you see anything not being Internet based?
Newspapers actually being printed, on paper? Your grandkids will laugh at that. Separate phones that don't have a screen or ability to multi task? Pfft. TVs that can only receive broadcasts? They're dead already.

I like the cut of your jib, bon chance Sir.

What about the value in owning tokens that allow you to use a global near-instant, secure, immutable peer-to-peer Internet payment system? 
The system is where the value is, BTC are the ability to use it. You've misunderstood the value proposition.
You also don't seem to understand that this is software. Bitcoin can, and is, just adopt innovative ideas from elsewhere. It's not stuck with the features it has now.

Sufficiently smart data mining would beat this.

Bit early to say but it could be the lack of true fungibility? If a transaction can be identified as illegal and all downstream transactions affected (ie exchanges etc won't touch coins associated with them) then that is a major attack vector for anyone trying to destroy it. 
Not a Monero fan boy, but the argument has some merit I think.
