Yeah, that‘s how the BCH scam works. Unfortunately it‘s not funny. Keep reporting Bitcoin dot com as a fraudulent website and give negative reviews to the wallet app.

It's official now. Roger Ver is an asshole.

Actually, I'm not. In case you're referring to the IONcoin subreddit, that's a paroday sub to make fun of the ION/XPY scammers.

Spam to drive up Bitcoin fees, probably by the people who run the Bcash scam, so they can push their false narrative of Segwit not working and blocks being too small. And if anyone doubts that Bcash shills want to to destroy Bitcoin, read this thread:

Pro tip: Sell some of your Shitcoin Cash for Bitcoin. It's free BTC!

The problem is that they didn't just fork the subreddit and coin, but that they're constantly lying, they sabotaged the Bitcoin blockchain with spam to prove a point, they used asicboost and sabotaged SegWit for it, they're ignorant towards the power games of mining cartels etc.

Hello Reddit. I can assure you that I am not a scammer. Please buy more paycoins. It's the cryptocurrency of the future and if it goes up in price I can dump more of the millions of premined paycoins I own to make some more dollars. I promise that I will reinvest all the money I made with GAWminers and Paycoin in one of my many gawesome projects such as Coinstand or Mineral. This is good for cryptocurrency as a whole. We are one big happy crypto family, aren't we?
