Yeah that's what gets me is to transfer from my account there's like a 2 week hold sometimes

I know! I thought BTC and other CC's are supposed to be virtually feeless but it seems like I might be missing something.

I've basically only used coinbase before but I agree that BTC ATM's are very important for future and the adoption of general people. I wonder if I buy Bitcoin with this machine can I put it in my coinbase wallet and take it out at a differently branded machines etc? I'm still pretty new to the whole BTC thing.

What's a wallet app you'd recommend?

Thank you!

Ok. And I can just transfer coins from coinbase to my wallet and vise versa?

I'm pretty new to it but would love to get more into it. How expensive is a hardware wallet and is a software wallet something to think about?

So it's another shitier currency that has nothing to do with Bitcoin? Lol

Yeah im gonna get a PC eventually for my .isic production and it may be powerful enough for mining but honestly it's probably more worth it to just buy and sell these days.. I have coinbase all ready just waiting to get paid Thursday and invest a little.

I will! Also what's the difference between BCH and BTC? I noticed both on coinbase.
