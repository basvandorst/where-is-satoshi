When investing you have to look stupid at some point. Ideally not after you close.

I agree, surely if people can get less money than they want from ATMs then they can only buy the basics. Dentists, doctors, Hairdressers, gardeners taxi drivers must be sitting with less work because of suddenly even less cash in the economy. If you offer a taxi driver Bitcoin, I'm sure he will think about it and maybe spend it somewhere later better than sitting doing nothing surely.

Ironic that what killed the record industry was the power of digital reproducibility combined with p2p, how could the opposite of a revolution also be revolutionary!? :)

You can buy flights with Bitcoin that should be enough to sell it!

The only reference to explain that Bitcoin foundation is not Bitcoin. Ugh

Am I right in thinking 'taking us along with it' is the opposite of 'to the moon'?

I'm not sure about these Bicoins, why is sexuality even a factor?

I disagree somewhat, if done right you can make the info concise and relevant for doctors to make a quick diagnosis and lots of them quickly. The good ones could make good money from home or wherever. They would need protection from damaging their real world reputation that's all I'm saying. 
I genuinely think most people would not trust or act on the opinion of students if they were really worried. Would you? You have to be careful not to just attract hypochondriacs with no actual problems going on. Students would be a great source of info but you need legit docs for credibility.  Eventually doctors could choose to publish their ratings in the real world if you got the rating part right.
Also in many countries there are people with only 1 doctor per 10000+ population. You could get a running start by getting doctors to provide a service for these people and get the humanitarian kudos. These people really need medical advice although many won't have computers. I agree with you that to these people a student is as good as a doctor. 
Bitcoin could be an optional tipping type feature for first world users. 
Thanks for the tip feel free to pm me I can give you more advice offline if you decide to do something.

I take credit card payments and sometimes get paid next day. But 24 hours is still 150 times slower than 10 mins!

As a doctor I think this is a great idea - definitely minus the selling drugs part. I have some experience in startups and have thought about this problem quite a bit minus the bitcoin. Would love to help develop something like this!
I also would happily give my time to sick to people who needed it if I could do so with no obligation from my phone or tablet with a few clicks while keeping my clinical mind sharp. I and many docs would enjoy looking over cases and suggesting a diagnosis and suitable tests, and getting feedback on how the person progressed and what other doctors suggested and why. Done right this could even be used for doctors to keep up their obligations of continuous professional development in some countries. This  is why I think it's a great idea - patients need it and many doctors would do it for free. Bitcoin just sweetens the deal so you could get the top docs to actually do it more than they would if it was unpaid.
The only problem with giving free advice is I, like most doctors, would worry that I would get sued for making a mistake.  Not seeing patients in the flesh increases the risk of this. Also  medicine is so traditional we worry that it might be impossible to not lose a case around something like this. Imagine in court having to say: ' I just gave some advice to a stranger across the Internet that I never saw, for the shady currency, bitcoins, your honour, and then they died, that's all.' Losing your licence is a big deal for doctors so we are generally conservative and defensive, why take risks.
Implemented correctly you could get multiple opinions and use consensus to rate doctors and get better diagnosis and a really strong system over time. Would love to know your plans and see this happen. 
You may also want to know from any legal people if a 'this in no way constitutes medical advice' disclaimer is legally binding and a good idea for such a concept.

True that, although I have been lucky, not one chargeback my gf has an online business and she has had 3. Really upset her.

Yes I think wallets should have a dead mans switch like this. If it was design feature of wallets that asks you to renew every week, possibly by email, and if you don't renew for a year, they are sent to a backup wallet that your descendants have access to.

Well there is a chance, however small, that Bitcoin could collapse before the halving. The chances of the prices going up because of the halving actually happening increases the closer we get, so it's also possible that the price will increase on or several months after like last time... I guess time will tell.

Wait .. Have you been paying her Bitcoin?

I'm a general doctor, throwaway account. I was involved in a startup competition in this space in 2012, and we came third out of 100, but didn't get funding so we kind of left it. Was talking with a friend literally last week about how bitcoin makes something like this possible. 
I agree wingman that subjective opinions are useless, everyone has a story about their doctor but many people don't understand when their doctors work is good or bad, the rating becomes a combination of if they like the doctor and if they get better without much hardship. I do believe there are a few specific objective ways of accurately rating medical advice and outcomes that could be easy to implement. 
I think selling drugs is the biggest problem with this idea. Just stick to medical advice.
