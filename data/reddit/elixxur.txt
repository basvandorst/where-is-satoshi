I'm holding a million of a coin and I'm not selling for a while. It's all about being patient.

So what does this "friend" say about it now?

I would have put 2500 and held, I did the same with a stock and sold before it dropped. I made the decision to sell it there and made 50k, the stock was Minerco, which is a shitty stock now. My point is I would have set a sell of at least 100 with BTC if I got in at 1 dollar. It's how I do it with coins, I did the same with LTC when I first purchased it three years ago and made some nice money on it when I sold it back when it was 30. That was my personal set limit, if it didn't hit then I am willing to take the loss. 
It's about 1. Being patient and 2. If you need the money that badly. I don't because I am not a spendy person. I don't even have netflix or a tv. 3. How much are you willing to lose.

First good luck. Second never use a loan to buy something you eventually have to give back. Loan companies could also go after your kin or whoever's in the estate. Though I could be wrong.

I didn't panic sell I was just pissed off their site was down again. It's annoying and they need to load test their site already because they can't handle the amount of traffic and transactions they receive.

It's new technology and unexpected. That's what happens when you don't hire people like me to do performance testing on their site. I'd break that site easily!
