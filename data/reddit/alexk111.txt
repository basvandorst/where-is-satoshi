BitPay CEO stated that they follow BIP-70 for their payments:  Here is the BIP-70:  The sequence of interactions step-by-step: 
1. Wallet App gets PaymentRequest from Merchant Server (Bitpay in this case)
2. Customer authorizes it
3. Wallet App both sends Payment data to the merchant server and broadcasts the transaction into bitcoin network **BEFORE** getting PaymentACK response
If they disregard the payments, that would mean that they made false statements about following BIP-70.

When you're buying something from one merchant you also sending a message to other merchants that you're ok about HOW the merchant does the business. And if there is some problem left without feedback, one day it might become a norm. 
You share customers' data with Bitpay. You share a slice of payments with Bitpay. That kind of things add more power to Bitpay with each transaction. Since Bitpay does harmful things for Bitcoin, you and your customers paying thru Bitpay also become participants in this. So it's ok to buy from a competitor who will provide a similar product, but without investing into the growth of a Bitcoin enemy. It's a way of protection of bitcoin values.
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:11:10
If you keep 100% of your Bitcoin income in Bitcoin and don't need conversion to fiat, what's the point of using a middle-man charging 0.8% per transaction? Why not to setup BTCPay in that case?

@_date: 2019-09-02 13:37:59
Correct. Couldn't find a better way. Any attempt to show the same address multiple times will compromise privacy.
Since all the addresses are derived from the same extpubkey, wallet recovery is not impossible. It will require to scan all the shown addresses and derive child privkeys for the ones with UTXOs to sign the transactions.

Then what's the point of using different addresses?


If an attacker can get all addresses of a person in advance, then clustering not needed - all the addresses are already linked to that person. Whereas if the addresses are unknown, then you can still use different methods to protect your privacy. For example, choose transaction inputs and outputs to not require a change output, or create more than one change output.

... and "No promises yet"
@_date: 2019-09-11 18:03:25
The IP-mapping approach:
- will cause address reuse for persons sending bitcoin multiple times
- may cause address reuse for random persons because of shared IPs
- enable attackers to pre-load bitcoin addresses mapped to shared IPs having a high probability of being used by someone. For example, shared IPs provided by VPN services. That makes it possible to link a bitcoin address to a sender VPN and a recipient. 
However, what if there will be temporary IP-mapping with a cache expiring after 5-10-20 mins? It will:
- still protect from an instant generation of millions addresses
- make address reuse unlikely, as same IPs persons should send a request within a few mins window to get the same address
- make it expensive to pre-load addresses for shared IPs, as attackers will need to always refresh the data
What do you think?

I meant that an attacker can sign up to well-known VPNs and collect addresses mapped to their IPs.

I agree that BTCPay is the only awesome processor in terms of Bitcoin values. But when you look at things from merchants' point of view, it might be not so awesome based on their business requirements.
IMHO at this moment if we want merchants to switch from bitpay and their payment protocol, it would be better to also show alternatives that would be easier to integrate their business with. 
This would also send a message to the other "paypals" that it's not ok to implement things like the payment protocol.
