The team behind BitHalo is working every day and night (literally, as team members are living in the US, Europe and Asia ;) ) in order to improve the client even further. The double deposit escrow can surely be applied for lots of different trading schemes. Next update should be released soon.

The BitHalo client is the world's first decentralized exchange client.
It is P2P contracting software that eliminates the need for a middleman. The Halo clients make contracts unbreakable by utilizing risk/reward motivators, each party puts up a deposit, the amount of which is predetermined by the parties, and the deposit is returned only once both parties sign off on the contracts complete and proper execution. Any kind of contract you can imagine is executable and safer using the Halo technology. An example of some contracts one can do are as follows: derivatives, trade, employment, micro-trading, financing with terms, forex and even real-estate.
The software is free for download and could completely change the way bitcoin and crypto currencies are exchanged and traded across the globe on a daily basis.

Not yet, but soon :) Right now it is OTC and free market trade, so true decentralization, and users can connect with each other through IRC, which is integrated into the client.
