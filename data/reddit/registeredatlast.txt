To pay interests on the 7000 btc he pretends to have in deposits for the next 6 months, he will have to come up with 200 000 btc at this rate of 15% a week ...  
The thing is it will collapse way sooner than BS&amp;T, unless it gets "investors" at a much higher rate, which I doubt it will ...

“We don’t anticipate this attack to be repeatable very easily.  If you do a naive implementation, you would need six months to run it successfully,” 
They used 200 ps3 for your second article so I guess it should prevent most script kiddies to do it.
Nevertheless, the first article points out that there are a lot of issues with ssl. Pretty serious issues.
@_date: 2012-04-18 09:06:43
but if I understand correctly they offer to lend $ for a 20% interest, not the other way around. And they give back "only" 8.6% interest so they still have a large benefit margin on these kind of transactions

So you spam this sub AND multiply the "ticket" price by 4 ? Go to Hell !  
Here s my first thought on this anyway :   
12 to 50 % payout seems ridiculously low imho.  
Why would anyone gamble money with such a low EV when they can play satoshidice with 98% payout and select the odds in advance ?
@_date: 2012-08-05 11:48:20
Why not hot chicks ?
@_date: 2012-09-13 22:40:30
Long story short :  
They bought a website called Bitcoinica which was soon after hacked, had some funds stolen and at least part of their database erased.  They froze the website for a month with almost no communication.  
Then they got robbed for another chunk of their customers' money due to their own incompetence.  
Then they basically walked away and refuse to communicate to this day.  They still carry on their other businesses anyway ...
@_date: 2012-08-28 22:59:31
You are correct. The result is the same though, money goes rarer and rarer.

Among other things, you can pass the coins through faucets that will mix them with other users' coins and redistribute it so it will be very difficult to know which coins came from where.  
Also, if the coins are just left alone you can t do anything to track the owner of the private key. The owner has to spend the coins for anyone to have a chance to find him. If he is very cautious, you might not even get that chance ...

the QR at the back only tells you if the coins are still available as a mean of verification.
@_date: 2011-06-30 14:27:21
I'm no expert but I think the main reason BTC are worth something is because some people believe it can be stable and valuable in the long run. So if you want your other currency to have value, you will have to convince people that it is worthy to invest time and/or money in this new currency.
Since many people have already invested in BTC, to convince them you will have to provide a "better" currency so the investment is worthy over time.
If the whole "improvement" of your new currency is just an increased amount of total coins available on the market, you didn't increase your total market value, you just divided the value of each coin. So mining would not be more profitable, you would just generate 20 times more coins, each one worth 1/20 the price of the whole block.
I don't know if I'm being clear because I'm neither a pro at BC/economics/english but my guess is that the number of coins in the system doesn't matter as much as the value of the whole market.
@_date: 2011-07-23 21:00:43
that's right, and you would destroy the card by doing so

They are the size of a credit card so you can easily figure out the total volume for the amont you want. I never tried to retrieve a bitcoin from a card though, but it seems easy as opening the card and scanning a QR with the right program ...

just saw that ... don't know if it's a troll or if it's serious but I would love to know why people would be ready to devote time and energy for this purpose.
other responses from the same guy :
**What would you like to see in future versions of the bitcoin software?**
I want the network destroyed. It's not personal, this is just a requirement of the project for which I have been assigned to.
**What would you like to see in the future of bitcoin in general?**
More bank account closures on the exchanges :)

I prefer they spend time/money on improving their solution than their website.
Awesome webdesigners are not always great at tech / business so why would you judge them essentially on this skill ?
@_date: 2011-07-23 23:22:50
We were talking about webdesign and you switched the subject to code. I thought you found their site ugly not disfunctional.
On Chrome it doesn't look broken so I had no idea what you were talking about until I checked for myself and I have to agree : the site is seriously broken on Firefox !
I guess it might come from Firefox and Chrome handling div positions in diffrent ways ...
Anyway I wouldn't conclude too quickly about the guy's tech skills. Webdev is a word in itself and I know quite a few very talented engineers that know very few about it but can make wonders in much more difficult fields ...
@_date: 2011-11-17 11:26:47
well even if they did, I don't see why they would tell anyone and by extent, allow anyone to let the word out ...
it's a troll if you ask me
@_date: 2011-08-18 06:40:02
Only the safer option to me seems to be betting on the "no" but you are right : at the moment I write 1 BTC invested on the "yes" option would win about 2.3 BTC if I understand correctly so it's way more risky (IMO) but a bit more profitable
that said I realize you can bet "yes" and buy about a million USD worth of BTC on july 31th to win
@_date: 2015-11-30 15:24:35

@_date: 2011-11-18 08:45:45
you're right, it doesn't. Also that would lower confidence in BTC for some people knowing there might be groups fighting BTC ...
I still feel like he's a troll but nothing's impossible :)
@_date: 2011-11-17 06:59:24
It's Probably Mtgox, from my understanding they have control over a huge amount of BTC
@_date: 2015-11-30 14:49:39
isn't 75% of the network a reasonable consensus ?
@_date: 2011-07-01 06:26:58

that sounds ridiculous, blocks have been full on a daily basis for weeks now.

first of all the all time high was about 30 $ for a very short period a year and a half ago, just before the MtGox disaster.  
second nobody can be sure but my guess is that if the price continues to fall, it wont fall far from where we are know, since more and more people get introduced to btc and more and more services seem to be avalaible each day.  
my advice : if you are in this to store value, buy as soon as possible and hold. If the price goes down, you can always buy more to reduce your average cost. If the price goes up, then it's just a matter of when will you sell.

This projet looks fantastic and I couldn't be more thrilled about how you guys are handling things ! This project is a great exemple of why bitcoin have all the reasons to succeed in the long run.  
However I am also quite sad about the name you choose. Don't get me wrong, as a French, butter flows in my veins but "Buttercoin" sounds goofy to me and doesn't go well with your intent to make something proffessional and of high end quality.  
Please consider other options in that matter.  
Anyway you'll still have my full support, even though you don't rename it MasterExchangePro3000 !
  
  
Edit : in French, "butter" means "stumble" and can be slang for "kill", so it might affect my perception

When I was a kid, some old folks used to count in "old francs", which were the old devaluated money in France after WWII. "New Francs" had been introduced in 1958.  
They were valued at 1 "new Franc" = "100 old Franc".  
  
I grew up in the 80's, a lot of old people (my grand parents' generation) were still used to talk in "old Francs" and it was very confusing.  
Now we have the euro, and it's also been a pain for many people to adapt. Some people still convert to "Old Francs". Imagine that.  
Forgot my point, must get old...

I don't get how he dares to show his face anywhere near anything BTC related.

made me laugh

You're totally spot on, we are no designers ourselves but we plan on contracting a pro designer when things start to take off !  
The "big" bet you saw was indeed denied because it was too high at the time but since then we raised the max bet limit to 0.2 BTC, so once more I totally agree we should make it clear why it was denied.  
  
Thanks for your input !

Great idea, loving it and subscribing right now !  
Edit : have you considered talking about it to the gamedev/indie gaming community ? I could totally use BTC to hire graphic/sound designers if talents were available. Plus it makes sense since talents and audience are spread worldwide.

a bit late to the party maybe :)
@_date: 2013-04-25 10:11:27
So far we have been testing quite a bit and a couple friends placed their bets also but I'd love to hear from someone on here !
@_date: 2013-08-08 02:16:38
For me, the main issues remain usability and difficulty to buy bitcoins with fiat.
@_date: 2013-05-17 09:20:23
Thanks for pointing that out !  The post has been edited.
@_date: 2013-07-07 07:04:49
Cool, I ll give coinurl a shot and investigate a-ads. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-05-20 11:23:50
tldr : it's not their fault and they are not sorry so fuck you all !
@_date: 2013-09-19 18:05:58
how much does it cost ?

Basically he was responsible for taking over Bitcoinica just before it was hacked a first time. To prove the website was poorly coded he released the source code including an API key that was used as the MT.Gox password. This enabled a second hack (or at least its cover up) and all databases and backups were erased.  
Then they all walked away, preventing their clients to retrieve even a bitcent of their own deposits. But they refunded their friends before.  
Furthermore they assured everybody that coins were all in cold storage before the second hack.  
Neither of them ever apologised to any cutomers, they all blame each others for everything and went on with their lives.  
The funder of bitcoinica, Zhou Tong, is also shady as hell since the hack seem to be his doings. He is now the fonder of coinjar.

That anonymity problem is bogus : not even one of the many thieves and scammers have been found thanks to informations available through the blockchain. If that's not a proof that we have enough anonymity, I don't know what is ...
@_date: 2013-05-21 16:33:10
Thanks for the offer !  
I will consider it in last resort though because it'd love to be able to do it from my own account to have access to all features including reports and stats and such.
@_date: 2013-05-21 17:32:14
7% sounds a bit high considering i'm the one taking the risks here but thanks for the offer, I'll let you know !
@_date: 2013-11-02 14:07:59
The presence of Amir Is enough for me to not take this seriously : we know what will happen if things go sour anyhow.
@_date: 2013-06-05 11:36:31
What the software is supposed to accomplish is not very clear to me.
@_date: 2013-08-29 12:36:30
again with the delfationary "issue" ... god damn, people can't think for themselves ...

So he promised something he didn't do? Reminds me of you...
@_date: 2013-05-16 12:00:58
Thank you very much for your kind words !

Hello,  
I just came accross your submission that I missed at the time.  
The high fees are a common misconception about our site.  
What you have to consider is that as opposed to almost all our concurrents, we are not a zero sum game that matches investors against one another.  
We also have the quite unique advantage of offering real time options as opposed to fixed rounds.  
Some of our clients have proved to be very good at this and their options expire in the money 80% of the time. Also time has proved that the bitcoin prices tend to go up in the long run.  Our algorithms take all that into account to calculate the returns we offer and we only include a 5% fee for all the risks we take and advantages we provide.  
Thanks for your interest and if you have any questions please email us at support

Hope for them their liquidity will improve because it looks dead now.
@_date: 2013-07-17 14:36:05
You're absolutely right. Strange I never noticed that before.  
In french the rule is that if the punctutation is composed of 2 signs ( : ! ; ? ...) you have to add a space before and after.  
TIL. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-07-21 21:18:46
Since a lot of people here seem to think bitcoin is not anynomous, you'll probably catch the hacker in no time !  
Ho wait ...
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:19:19
Once you bet on black, you can't go back !

There have been a bit of press coverage, a lot of it was sensationalist though. There are a few people out here spreading the world in a positive way, like Phillipe Herlin, who went to Europe1, FranceCulture, BFMTV and more.  
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:35:46
He allowed the hack though and never fought for the coins he were responsible for. Neither of them even went to the police to file a report when 40000 btc had been stolen from their customers.  
I would never trust Amir with anything that matters. He is an idealist and a dreamer with no sense of responsability and no empathy.
@_date: 2013-04-06 09:24:31
If you mean an authentic coward who fled his responsabilities then I m all with you !  Try listening with your brain and not your heart :)
