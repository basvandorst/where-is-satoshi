Is there an ELI5 as to how this is risky?

This has been known since the beginning of RH. If this news is a surprise to you, you should really take a look at other services you use for free and thing what they're getting from you. Also, duck the article for saying only millennials are affected. Fucking buzzword shot news.

To me that's like saying "Don't believe in Apple or Microsoft, believe in the kickstarter-startups that are just entering the market." Because if the blockchain already exists with other established coins, why go for the new players? Because they're new and trendy?

The logarithmic scale [see edit], while good for representing data that tends to compound along the x-axis, invalidates this data as it's an arbitrary assumption. More than likely BTC is going to grow (and has been growing) too rapidly  to accurately represent it with a natural scale, but who's to say that the price of BTC is going to follow a logarithmic scale? I'd wager that the proper scale to be used is somewhere between a base 1 and base 10 scale.
[edit] At first look I thought it was a log scale on the y-axis, but it seems to jump in odd increments of 2 and 3... This really does make me want to disregard the graph as a whole.

If it makes you  feel any better, I bought +29 ETH with BTC the hour before it plummeted a few days ago.
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:21:17
No, it's not. That red line in no way accurately represents the data.

I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but doesn't that make any sense? It would make sense if *withdrawals* weren't permitted yet, meaning people couldn't move their money out. But deposits? No one's taking money out of the coin and yet the price is going up?

Gotta HODL. Some will just never learn.

Ahh understood, thanks!

What's that helicopter handbook doing at the bottom right?
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:03:39
I would never have known, thanks!

This is the first image for the Coinbase app on the app store, not my personal app.

Priced in fiat. Yikes.

Keep in mind there are going to be (fewer) than 21 million BTC in circulation. 10-20 multiplier means only 210-420 million will be in circulation.

Price consolidation is a good thing right now. It shows support.
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:40:46
Pretty poor taste.

Because the commenter didn't know that this was from Lord of the Rings. Hehe.

It's not the US governments job to make sure you get your BTC back within 72 hours; it's to make sure the law is being followed. Buying and HODLing BTC is risky and you just drew the short end of the stick by choosing the exchange that was helping to launder billions of BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:45:44
BTC-e stole from citizens of the US. It's not like Russia would have done anything. Putin's a fan of corruption and he'd try to take some for himself.

This is why I don't turn to for political discussion.

[They didn't walk into Russia with their dicks out]( arresting left and right. They didn't even arrest Vinnik. He was in Greece at the time so they issued a warrant to have him arrested for his crimes. Since the business was issued on a .com domain extension, it's therefore able to be seized by the US government. And for shutting the whole business down? It's money laundering everyone who touches that exchange is in some way implicated, whether knowingly or unknowingly. It sucks when the evidence is a lot of money on a foreign exchange. But, laws are laws.
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:25:46
It's because the company was involved in a multi billion dollar money laundering operation, you dipshit!
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:29:19
Why the hell are you downvoted? That's all true.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:28:25
I'm sad.
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:50:26
You're right. Businesses that operate in multiple countries should be allowed to commit whichever crimes they want. Not to mention, had they used a .ru domain they wouldn't have been seized by the US.
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:01:51
Ah yes, it must be shameless plug day today.

Possibly for the same reason why many believe there shouldn't be a Nobel Prize for economics; saying that there's a winner may cause others to believe their opinion without proper research-based evidence. It's fine in different, hard-science fields, but in a field that isn't able to perform hard science experiments and must work on theory and historical data, it could lead many astray. To apply it to Bitcoin, what if Satoshi put his support behind one technology and not the other but he was wrong? He could potentially hurt the coin because people see him as the 'face' of Bitcoin, which leads into the importance of anonymity.
