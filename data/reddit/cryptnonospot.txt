4 cents to transfer an asset... that you paid a fee to buy with fiat and the person on the other end will pay a fee to convert (much more than 4 cents may I add.) neither of those processes are instantaneous.
this circle jerk has to stop. bitcoin is great, but it's not the jesus of money. comparing it to a traditional money transfer service without including the part where those on both ends want/have fiat is misleading.

Wasn't implying we used the asics, but this subreddit has a lot of geeks with a lot of pc's &amp; bandwidth, and maybe a botnet or two... they're not profitable for mining much anyways.
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:31:09
i've never trusted canadian bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-03 05:11:45
regardless. My winnings and losings both go unreported, and won't get reported til there's not an anonymous wallet left.
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:17:39
but I already live in the most spoiled nation in the world... why would I want to slum it?
@_date: 2014-06-12 14:37:38
we should also stop voting in our respective national elections and form our own government.
@_date: 2014-12-04 14:40:51
and there it goes. I'm finally going to have to unsub this subreddit. It's past the point of delusion to continue to only talk about the cost to send the money and not the cost to get usable fiat.
this fucking circlejerk is going to turn me into a buttcoiner quick. the quality of this subreddit is plunging quick.
@_date: 2014-04-01 14:52:16
If you made it past the title without picking up on the joke, bitcoin may not be for you.

That is unless you consider my wallet used only for losing money tax-free on poker sites...

well shit. RIP bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-24 14:39:59
aren't all these companies cashing out large quantities of bitcoin what is causing the drop in price? Wouldn't we all prefer to be rich with no where to spend our money?

my advice: come ride the uptick on doge with us.

Credibility, consumer protection &amp; access to a whole lot of sites that have already set paypal as their payment gateway.

new IRS rules insure strong future for non-us based bitcoin tumblers.
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:38:11
probably due to people selling to buy doge.

well they already own all the US debt, *mine* as well let them in on this game too.

2 hour later edit: just watch the whole thing. I don't think i've ever heard such an articulate explanation on the future of cryptos.
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:04:06
Yeah. Bitcoin's stellar recent history is sure to ease Target's investors' worries. They should probably just enstate Mark Karpelès as CFO while they're at it.

After the FBI's SR report i've got faith that if run on the tor network by competent folk who avoid related clearnet activities they'd be quite effective. Probably pretty profitable too even with a minor percentage based fee.
*A note to the NSA, FBI and other suits reading this now and in the near future. Probably wasn't me.*

next you're gonna tell me you wouldn't have invested in betamax tapes either? In all seriousness, btc can not be the end game. It's got issues like all groundbreaking tech. Why some people are investing so heavily in something that WILL be replaced by a better technology is beyond me. Use it for spending, not saving.

Let's hope its altitude isn't tied to btc value.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:49:20
well they're not wrong, it does have a bad reputation if your only exposure to bitcoin is through the news.
The media prefers stories with controversy, drugs, theft, fraud and of course hit-men. If these stories have been their only exposure to bitcoin, what do you expect they'll think?
tl;dr: start tipping the uninitiated, allow people to discover bitcoin on their own.

It's not investing, it's gambling.
If you can't afford to lose it, don't use it to buy bitcoin, stocks, or chips at a casino.
If you can afford to lose it, do your own research and hope for the best.
