Thanks a lot! It worked itself out and just took time... I appreciate your help!

The transaction has magically fixed itself. Bitcoins are a strange entity :/
Thanks for your help!

Okay.... this is driving me a little crazy. I imported the .dat file into blockchain and not only did it NOT recover the bitcoins that started this thread, but the final amount of bitcoins in the wallet is even lower than in Bitcoin-QT!

Awesome! Thanks!
What's an ROI??
No free electricity... but I could plug in the computer at work and get the institution to pay for it...
Anyway... I see that the return is quite small

Should I:
1. Send the bitcoins from the Bitcoin-QT wallet into a new wallet on blockchain in hopes that that will give me the full value of what should be there and then restore Bitcoin-QT hoping that the little bit lost in the mysterious transaction will come back
2. Just delete and reinstall Bitcoin-QT, re-download the blockchain, put the backed up wallet.dat file into the Bitcoin-QT folder and then hope that the full total of all the bitcoins returns?
Thanks. I really do appreciate your help!

Forgive me for being redundant, but to clarify: LE can't access those bitcoins? They're lost to cyberspace?

Hey brokenreference, thanks for your help so far... so I'm still slightly confused.
I've been following the "position in queue" on the link you posted above. It finally ended but not it says "Transaction Not Found" but my Bitcoin-QT still says "unconfirmed (0 of 6 confirmations)" and the coins aren't back in my wallet.
Is this where I have to now backup the wallet, reset bitcoin-QT and reimport the wallet? will that make the coins come back?
Thanks a lot for the help!
