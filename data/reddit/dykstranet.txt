Coming from the card-not-present payments industry, I can say that conversion rates drop when more payment options are offered. Seeing a bitcoin payment button is likely to send a buyer off to research BTC as opposed to completing their purchase.

Maybe take a look at the psychological phenomenon called "Cognitive Dissonance". Questioning something that one thinks they already understand, like money, can be painful.

One cost missing from this graph is the float. The money can be in limbo for 5 business days or more. Each end of this transactions misses out on the use of that money during this time.

[Hubud]( has the best Internet connection I've found here in Bali.  
They maintain several Internet connections: 
10mbps dedicated fiber optic (primary connection)
10mb up and 10mb down simultaneously. Guaranteed 10mbps from Hubud to Singapore. Other locations are dependent on various Internet routing and other factors. 
8mbps shared fiber optic (overflow &amp; non-computer devices connection)
2mbps down / 512k up DSL (backup connection, guest network)
2-5mbps down 3G wireless backup

There is fast internet in Bali although it varies from place to place. I know HUBUD went through a lot to ensure a good, consistent connection with multi-provider redundancies.
