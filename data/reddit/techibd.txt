90% chances you lose 10k, 10% chances you make 99 times return? really? 
well i just love those odds, net gain 910%, how could i argue with that?

Dude you are literally following me around now. 
I would have wrote a webspider on all of your comments to extract some keyword on you, but then it seems like a waste of time. 
I went thru the past two days of your post history, it seems like you are a day trader ? Lots of free time for sure and god damn you post too much man. Lol this is likely my most active day ever on reddit and I made something like 10 comments and you just argue nonstop. Literally. And pottery? Yea you are definitely older than me. I am a young person. I hold two bachelors. I don’t know how that s so unbelievable to you, does that sounds like bragging? Literally everyone I know hold a degree in quantitative hard science plus maybe a MBA if they previously worked in IB. You reacted almost attacked by my degree, so likely you don’t have one in stem major. In fact given that you pick on my grammar, you almost certainly studied some liberal arts stuff back in college and feel like you  are a smart person and even that you couldn’t break into finance, you think you are just as good, if not Better than I am and better informed. Hence the hostility 
Prop shop? Not likely. No pro traders would take bitcoins seriously. And penny stocks? That’s laughable. One trade Pro made will suck dry the liquidity of that tiny sub 50 million cap shit you called a stock. So you likely trade for hobbies. Develop your own philosophy and just very defensive of it. 
 
And your comments were downvoted almost entirely in btc sub yet you just keep on going. That I don’t know why really. 
I feel like now I gain some actual respect for you. You should keep going. Your tenacity impress me. 
I could very much be totally wrong here and you might be a pro. At least you are coherent and stand by your shit. And if you’re a big deal person and live in Greenwich, please don’t cut my bonus I still want six zeroes this year . 
Cheers

Lol and what asset is backing bitcoin right now?
Does bitcoin have inherent value ?
Warren buffet s portfolio literally have or had companies that are so undervalued that you d make more money privatizing it, does that apply here? 
And that If we see it as a currency, then : 
First, why don’t you make it like a true currency where you use it to directly price merchandises?  Say, if a cell phone is worth one btc, regardless what btc/usd is, it’s always one btc. That’s a currency. 
What you have now is you price the merchandise in USD, then you either convert your usd to btc, or take btc out of wallet to transfer, then the seller convert btc back to USD.  Wow that’s so convenient. 
And what kind of forex trader would think “ hmm , bitcoin/USD is free falling right now, let me get some more of that”???

That’s pretty comprehensive, but I don’t get what you are getting at. 
That btc is super volatile so see it as instrument not investment? Then what are you doing right now? 
Or on the contrary, btc has excellent investment qualities? Well, if it’s a long term investment, then by definition you don’t sell, but could you still call it a currency if the liquidity is dead water? 
It can’t be both currency and investment. You can’t have drastic volatility in a currency , and you need volatility to trade.

You should sell, don’t even think about buy the dip.
The advices here are heavily skewed bcs all of you literally hold the same stuff, so everyone is long on bitcoin.
Any pro traders that worth their salt would say that buy the dip to “average your cost “ is literally the worst idea ever. When it works, it’s pure dumb luck , and when it doesn’t , bang, you just double triple quadruple your losses. If you compare the pro and con it’s not worth it.

I can go all day with you but I don’t see the point. Do you honestly think that Warren buffet having UA in his portfolio will in anyway prove my claim wrong? Guy has hundred of billions in his portfolio, no shit he is gonna diversify his holdings, big surprise? But the day he start to buy overhyped shit like Uber or Snapchat(how so much like btc)  I will admit I am wrong.
On a more serious note, decentralized currency just wont work at this point, that’s our fund’s POV, and we are one of the largest tmt sector hedge fund in the world. 
If we are being honest then we can all admit that currency nowadays are not backed by gold or any assets at all, it’s all determined by trade surplus or trade deficit. 
China’s manufacture and export numbers were weak, they lose lots of their business to Cambodia or Vietnam or whatever. They are not bringing home as much USD or EUR as they used to, so a simple supply and demand means their own currency will worth less, almost 10% in the past year? 
Same goes with Canada and Australia. Weak oil and fossil fuels exports, weak money. 
I actually think a universal currency is a good idea and possible, but it’s not gonna happen with countries like Greece, Italy and most of Africa dragging the rest of us down with their crippling debts.
With btc, I don’t ever think it’s gonna be adopted universally. Bcs essentially you are talking about that if it’s accepted as universal and replaced every other currency, a selected handful of people ( relatively speaking ) would already own as much as a quarter to a third of all wealth on earth. That’s just vastly unrealistic.
I think probably something more controlled and regulated in the future would be promising , but not btc

yep i copied from my reply to someone else. 
The trading volume is probably hundreds of times over the actual amount being spent now.
And it's just not true that people will spend it when the currency is expected to raise in value. That's literally the definition of deflation. 
Why would they spend it? if they just wait for a little while and effectively everything is discounted.

It’s called macroeconomic strategy, and lots of hedge fund adopt this approach called“ global macro “. 
to go long on USA economy you would invest in bonds, stocks, reits, and maybe some currencies but the fluctuation is so small it’s probably not gonna be worth it, and most of the hedge funds are USD or GBP based anyway.

I don't want to offend you bcs it looks like you want to have a civilized discussion here, but most of what you said in the last two sentences doesn't make much sense or related to one another. It sounds like you are quoting some generic stuff from some bitcoin frenetic without actually think for yourself. 
The reason fiat is relatively stable is because it's heavily regulated. The central bank buy and sell their countries' own currency on global market to balance the supply and demand, and therefore stabilized its volatility .They are not there to make or lose money. They don't care, bcs they printed the money themselves anyway. 
In bitcoin, the reason you had, have and will have huge volatility is bcs it is not regulated by anyone. Anyone partaken in it want to long, or short the hell out of it. Either way, all investors. 
Take a look at Major stock/securities markets, look at how heavily regulated it is, how harsh the fine/sentences are, and then still there are fraud, manipulation, tax evasion, bribery, insider trading, money laundering, "creative accounting", etc. People will risk anything to profit IF they think they can get away from it. 
And now to imagine all of those ppl pumping, dumping, shorting btc non-stop, 24/7. the market doesn't close. There will be rampant fake news, bull or bear, and no one is there to regulate it, so much so that your average investor can't tell fake from real, and then of course the same fraud, manipulation, tax evasion, bribery, insider trading, money laundering. 
The future doesn't look so bright now, does it?  Again, i work for a major player in TMT sector, we have data scientist and analyst on payroll for tens of millions running models on these scenarios. It's all about calculated risk. If we can't safely predict our downside, we might as well liquidate our fund and throw 10B on roulette.
Right now to me personally, it's just mass psychology at play, that's it.

In a recent interview published in mandarin, Bitmain's own mining facility based in xinjiang China, with nearly 400,000 unit of Ant S9 and S15, is spending almost 7M USD per month on electricity, enough to power 100M household for a month.They are shorting on Chinese crypto exchange, said in the interview. 
With the three biggest rigs manufacture,as well as more than 50% of global computing power all based in China, i would say CME open interest means very little. 
But i agree that crypto is so fragmented that it's hard to gain clarity on the overall picture.

Theoretically that could happen. 
But most people don't have wealth, they have living money. 
Your average american has less than 6 months of living cost in savings. 
When recessions hit, sure the billionaires lost their worth by 50%, but your average joe lose their job, their income, can't pay their mortgage, have their car repod. 
They don't have wealth to protect, they have bills to pay. If they have any cryptos at all, you better believer they be selling till nothing s left.

Fund money coming in or not has nothing to do with tech or politics. 
CDOs, Forex, these stuffs provide very little to none real world value yet ppl trade, or more like gamble, them anyway. 
Bitcoin is just too small of a market with not enough liquidity. Say a trading floor of a certain bank comes  in throwing in a few billions, it will immediately dry up supply and drive the price to the moon, but then who are they going to sell it to? That's a big question mark. 
In a way, the bubble already burst. your average mom and pop investor will be extra extra cautious now to ever enter the market again, but if they are not, who's gonna? Whose money are going to help insistituion to exit and realize their gain?

There need to be a reason for the market to bounce, right now all the charts, news, or psychology in the market is not bullish.
As an investor you could hypothetically " hodl " and not realize your loss, which is fine. But mining farms cost tens of millions to built, and half a million a month in utility is not even considered high.
Unless those power company accept bitcoin ( a set value that is, not a conversion from fiat), miners r gonna have to cash out to fiat.
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:39:31
I don't suppose there will be a flood of new money coming in, it's just too risky. everybody is looking to get out, and not enough to get in. 
It's all a mental game now. Whenever the market as a entirety feel that there are enough positive news to turn around, that's when it will turn around. Else, the miners will just keep on shorting, and well, massive short positions tend to push the market down. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 04:12:23
Mostly agree. 
During recession, money will flow to any assets that can cash flow or pay out dividend. Usually mulit-unit, commercial real estate, bonds, blue chip stocks, etc. All speculative shits will get dumped like crazy, luxury real estates, tech stocks with super high P/E, etc. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 03:35:13
You are again just downplaying the power cost ..... 
Bitmain pay 7M a month for their farm in Xin Jiang, China, or 84M a year. Their farm is in the mid of fucking nowhere and the local head for power corp went on record said that they got roughly 10M a month in power revenue in an interview, he even said these farms consume so much electricity monthly it's enough to power 100M household for a mont, although i think thats bit an exaggeration,probably due to the fact that Xin jiang is relatively undeveloped and ppl don't even use that much power for their daily life.
Bitmain and few other small timers have roughly 600,000 units set up in Xin jiang, and Bitmain accounted for about 400,000 unit in their own farm, they did only added a whole bunch this year thou, didn't have as many last year. 
Assuming each unit cost them two three hundred bucks to make, 100M in building cost, which is really not that far away from the annual power bill, is it? 
And if you look at their finance closely, they didn't record any lost suffered, they were using price from last year and didn't adjust their holdings in crypto to market value. ( they recorded 740Mil loss last quarter, bruh, shit catch up eventually) 
You were right about the 5 yr thing, but until the price really blew up last year, i highly doubt 1800 coins a day at a few grand a coin is that profitable of an operation, at least not on 2018's scale.

Yes but there are always cheaper electricity somewhere. I heard investors are going to iran to build up farm now. The local gov offered them power that's 1/7th cost of China, which is already insanely cheap. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 04:02:10
Well lol. 
I just think the whole thing went way out of hand. I heard ppl are going to Iran to build new farm, investinf serious money again, because the local government offered something like 1/7th of the power cost of China. 
To be in violation of international trade law , just to build centers in the mid of a fairly uncivilized war zone, to what? to make a few bucks by consuming massive amount of power. 
It just sounds unreal anyway you look at it. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:39:13
Interesting you should bring that up. The biggest three mining rig manufactures are all based in China. All three filed IPO application with Hong Kong stock exchange and all are either denied, or in limbo. Simply bcs their future financial stats are so hard to predict. sale of rigs fall something like 90% since summer. 
Again, a considerable mining farm cost tens of millions to build, and will cost probably just as much in power bill in any given year. fiat they used to pay the bills has to come from somewhere, and yes in theory mining could be outrageously profitable, but they have only been doing it for how long? a year? two year? 
How long does it take to recoup that cool couple hundred millions tied up in the farm? do you think Bitmain finance that themselves out of pocket with cash, or that realistically they should have investors, investors who now just want to kill themselves. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:49:59
He is right and i mostly agree,  but remember the market cap of bitcoin and liquidity now is nowhere near that end of the year bull run when that video was posted. Even Andreas himself started that sessions wondering who the hell is going to short bitcoin. Well, obviously now you see that as an asset that drop almost 80% in the courses of a few months, everyone that could short it shorted it. 
What you see right now is more of a systematic shorting from miners, as opposed to speculative short by traders. Traders don't hold their position that long and with that easily spotted pattern.  
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:37:51

It's really more of a cost thing.
The smaller ones operating at a cost of 6-8K per coin mined, the big ones at 3-4K per coin mined.
If the price keep falling, big farms will have to short too, which will exacerbate and amplify the bearish outlook.
I looked at the cost to build those farms, it cost upward ten million dollars to build a farm that mine 100 coins, shit s expensive and serious money. Half a million a month just in utility bills. 
And they invested that much based on the premises that it will be a long term operation, even at 20K some of these farms would take a couple years to start making profit and covered all the initial investment. Now it's not even been a few months, rigs are worth barely 10% of what they were bought for, and ppl are seriously panicking and desperate
