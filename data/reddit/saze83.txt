Have you driven a modern day supercar? They are very practical nowadays, with adjustable ride height, quality of life improvements like light clutch and steering, and cameras to make up for lack of visibility. Porsches are super practical now; a Porsche Turbo can easily be an every day car* if you don't need more seats.

Absolutely the worst company I have ever dealt with. I am a generally smart consumer and usually don't get the run around, but with BFL it is an effort just to get these guys to reply to emails. I bit the bullet and waited over 6 months for the miner to arrive and now 2 of the 8 cores are blown. That represents a 25% drop in capacity and there are now 5 unanswered emails just to arrange an RMA.  
I could not recommend this company to my worst enemy and cannot wait until they are run out of business by market forces.

I really didn't mean to offend your Marxist sentiments, after all it wasn't Capitalism that built your "private jet" but in fact your staunch idealism.

I hold physical gold myself but my problem with it is that the manipulators and corrupters hold a majority of paper gold and thus are able to suppress the market as they please. BTC is in the hands of the people for now and to me that is worth its weight in gold (excuse the pun).

You think that is by accident?

That's a brilliant bit of advice, and exactly what I'm thinking at the moment. I was hoping to contribute to blockchain security but this is the only way I'd ever break even.

Meh, that's small potatoes compared to what mining equipment industry could potentially be worth if BTC takes off. They were simply able to take advantage of an inelastic supply chain in a relatively small window of opportunity.

This video would find a good home in I honestly couldn't watch past a couple minutes due to facepalming relating injuries.

Further to your excellent point, the act of "destroying" BTC further increases the value of the remaining BitCoins in existence.
