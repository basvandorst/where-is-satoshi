I mean if I put in a pin but typed it wrong setting it to something else and there was no conformation pin to confirm that the pin I had  entered was in fact the pin I wanted.

Alright upon further inspection I think I was hacked or otherwise exploited. There were 3 transactions on the same day over 4 months ago at the same time. They were each for less than 50 cents and all different addresses. There were 2 received and one sent. If I did test it out I'm pretty sure it would have all been the same address and I don't think I would have done it 3 times.
 I do seem to remember making a transaction or two just to make sure it worked but it would have been with the same address and none match any of my wallets. Is there any way to lock or change this wallet without the spending pin in case it was compromised? Also if it was in fact hacked wouldn't it be cleaned out by now?

The company said it can be any number of digits. Usually I use a standard 4 digit but tried everything I might have made it

I'm thinking I mistyped and maybe there wasn't a confirmation pin. I'll try brute forcing it sometime when I'm at my pic.

That's funny my captain keeps comparing it to tulip mania but I always catch him reading about it.. a few months ago he convinced me to buy 100 Oz of silver.. had I held onto the BTc they'd be worth 5400 dollars right now. Not even mad tho...

Bit instant is in my limited experience the fastest and easiest way. There is a 3.99% fee and a $2.95 transfer fee from zipzap, the company providing the transfer, but you can walk into your neighborhood gas station or any place that does money gram bill payments and have coins transferred in minutes to mtgox, a block chain wallet or even sent to you directly via email. If you don't mind waiting and your mtgox account is verified you can also do free bank transfers from dwolla. The 4% isn't a great rate but if you're buying low you'll get your money back and then some.
