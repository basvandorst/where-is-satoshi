smooth upgrade (binaries for generic linux)

Yes, I know. There is still “-getinfo” option for bitcoin-cli but no RPC version of such a call.

Try bitcoin-cli -getinfo  for old style output

    bitcoin bitcoin-cli getinfo
    error code: -32601
    error message:
    getinfo
    
    This call was removed in version 0.16.0. Use the appropriate fields from:
    - getblockchaininfo: blocks, difficulty, chain
    - getnetworkinfo: version, protocolversion, timeoffset, connections, proxy, relayfee, warnings
    - getwalletinfo: balance, keypoololdest, keypoolsize, paytxfee, unlocked_until, walletversion
    
    bitcoin-cli has the option -getinfo to collect and format these in the old format.
    bitcoin bitcoin-cli -getinfo

I downloaded ready made binaries from  and replaced old bitcoind and bitcoin-cli in /usr/local/bin directory.
