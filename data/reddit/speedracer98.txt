the rest of the quote reads "...because the age of fair wages is long gone, slave wages are the only way ahead"

if you were to apply for special programs where the energy bill is lowered due to reported income then you would be able to make money. also if you were to install mining software on a full computer lab where you don't pay for the hardware or the power consumption then you would profit.

@_date: 2017-11-26 06:06:56
i'm gonna laugh when it crashes and then i start investing in it.

That's what the man wants you to think.

um i think he accepted guilty on different charges to avoid the death penalty for the murder for hire thing.
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:47:37
just because the charges were dropped does not magically mean he did nothing,
he made a plea deal to avoid lethal injection. he chose life in prison over death.
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:04:06
just stating the facts. go ahead and disagree with the verdict, but the charges were murder for hire, not running a website.
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:28:06
actually it was because he was charged with murder for hire. he was found guilty.
that is why he got 2 life sentences.
