You can definitely loosen your anus investing in cryptocurrencies.

Same thing was said about the floppy disc in 1977.

Men lie, women lie, numbers don’t. One of the big sells on bitcoin in the early years was that you could send money instantly for pennies. Now it can take several hours and costs $20 per transaction. If you’re an average person who wants to invest in crypto and can only afford to invest $100 a month, you are losing 20% of your investment just transferring your money from the exchange to your wallet. It is a serious drawback and in a market where there are alternatives that have resolved these issues, there is no reason to treat bitcoin like Jesus Christ.

But this is going to happen everywhere. Get used to it. You can lie to yourself and say the currency is “decentralized”, but at the end of the day there will always be a central institution to mediate transactions even if you hold the currency yourself. When people have power you better believe they will use it to their advantage.

Get out of here with your logic.

Serious question, why does the community prefer Bitcoin over Bitcoin Cash? Is it simply because you have more investments in Bitcoin? Or is there any reason to prefer it based on the technology? As far as I can tell Bitcoin Cash has the superior technology and has vastly greater utility. Would be happy to hear your guy’s opinion.
Side note: I hold both coins so I am not biased, just genuinely curious. This sub often seems like a religious cult of Bitcoin and I am just trying to make sense of things.

I don’t follow cryptocurrencies that closely and I knew it was being added to coinbase. They had the COO of coinbase on CNBC and he was dropping all kinds of hints that it was being added soon. The price was surging for a couple days following his appearance on the show. If I knew it was being added to coinbase in the next following days, then I have no reason to think that people who devote their lives to following cryptocurrncy markets and news wouldn’t know. I am sure that people who work at coinbase could have leaked information. But at the end of the day if you follow this stuff even remotely, you should have known. You can’t be salty now because BCH started surging and you were too close minded and religious about BTC to move some of your BTC investments around.

Definitely insulting, I would change banks too. But, from the banks perspective, they may be conserved about you buying crypto on credit that you can’t afford to lose. They might just be looking for their best interest.
