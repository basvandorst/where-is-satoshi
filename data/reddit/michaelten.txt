Was it not necessary in December 2017? 
@_date: 2018-09-12 01:08:24
Ok. Thanky
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:58:25
Would bigger blocks prevented the high fees in December 2017?
@_date: 2018-09-12 01:07:42
Good points
@_date: 2018-09-12 01:07:32

I don't have stong opinion on it.
It seems like the ability to successfully scale right now can help drive and accelerate adoption. 
Perhaps if merchants realize a cryptocurrency can serve hundreds of millions right now, then adoption would likely be accelerated.

For now. Might stay that way. 
I saw a video of Jihan Wu of Bitmain talking before Roger Ver and i am fairly certain i remember Jihan stating that Lightning is not a workable or realistic scaling solution.
I can find and post a link to the video tonight if you want. Its like 1.5 hours long about. 
Maybe jihan is wrong.

It seems like what happened in Dec 2017 should have never happened. I lost a lot of faith in Bitcoin Core after that. Perhaps Bitcoin Core will be able to serve hundreds of millions of individuals faster than any of the other 2000+ cryptocurrencies in existence. We'll see.

Perhaps miners will vote with their hashing ability.

Lay terms? I'm Thx.

His views probably haven't changed. Why would you use the term worry if his views have no merit?

Are there any Lightning wallets for Android? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:45:20
Is Bitcoin supposed to function like cash or something? ��
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:00:34
So is Lightning bitcoin? 
@_date: 2019-05-19 18:48:51
How can Bitcoin bank the unbanked if fees are over $1 and hundreds of millions of people earn less than $2 per day?
@_date: 2018-12-23 10:33:11
Should Bitcoin be peer to peer electronic cash? Even for those earning $2 or less per day? 
@_date: 2019-05-18 07:43:56
What are the current fees to send Bitcoin? Thanks and limitless Peace.
