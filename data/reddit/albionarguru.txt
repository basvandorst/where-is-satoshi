You sure you didn't just copy "Bit Cones" from a popular post from yesterday? Or maybe your 6 year old follows bitcoin on Reddit?

I didn't know they were into crypto! I used to watch them for alllllllll kiiiiiinds of gains

No because even I don't know why she "should be in jail".
You can't just make an inflammatory post to get people to click on it. And then people ask what you meant, respond with 'muhhhhh Google it'.

This never happens to me �� I bought at £7611 35mins ago and usually it drops 35% as soon as I buy. Now it's shot up??

Just curious, why don't you want to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-18 22:31:11
I doubt it. Coinbase is literally the most popular exchange for buying bitcoin in the UK. What reason would they have to close them?
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:08:27
I certainly do!

I only follow this subreddit in regards to crypto. *shrugs* but I have seen this before because people commented saying that if you can't withdraw its useless. Others asked how they made money if there were no fees

Wow I really feel like i need to spell this out for you. I think that Bitcoin today, is on par with being told about the opportunities of investing in Apple and Amazon when they first hit the market.
Someone back then would think it would be too good to be true if they were told about investing in Apple and Amazon. I feel the same way about Bitcoin. What don't you understand?

@_date: 2019-08-19 12:14:36
I'm not sure where the confusion has come from. I know companies don't match bitcoin and I also know that bitcoin fluctuates. It doesn't negate my point.
I'd have a kick-ass pension, but I don't want to wait until I'm 80+ to get it. Hence why I'm steering towards a private pension
@_date: 2019-08-19 16:28:52
You conveniently left the next bit out where i said that someone also told you to invest big in it. Their potential wasn't public knowledge.
But yeah you're completely right. Bitcoin is a bunch of BS, especially since you spend your day on the Bitcoin subreddit. I wish I had the time to spend my day reading and spouting BS.

No idea! I think it has something to do with Epstein. People are saying there will be something like an attack in the next few days to change the media attention. I was just curious, that if it did become reality, what affect it would have on Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-16 12:28:03
It depends on what your goals are. 'Meagre investments' may lead to parents being able to treat their children at Christmas, vacations, pay off debt etc. The amount I can/want to invest over the next 12 months won't buy me a house, but it's enough to make life more comfortable. But over the next 20 years I would like my hodling to have me retire early.
The moon is subjective to each person. There's no such thing as a waste of investment in the Bitcoin world
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:34:26
I might have to start doing this. I'm with Santander but the last thing I need is my accounts closing
@_date: 2019-08-13 00:54:57
Can you please elaborate on "don't buy bitcoin, earn it" please? I've seen people say it but I assumed it meant something completely different
@_date: 2019-08-16 12:39:04
You could consider it a wasted opportunity, but not a wasted investment if you're only buying 0.000000001 bitcoin a time. I want $16,000,000 but I'd be more than happy if it was a lot less too
@_date: 2019-08-04 16:55:05

I think the only fault his friend made was not having enough of an emergency fund. Although worryingly according to the media, the vast vast vast majority of Americans (and probably us Brits) don't have enough in savings either

As a non-american I'm torn with Bernie. On one hand, I don't want to see him elected because he's he's a lunatic. On the other, he'll completely tank the stock market and butfuck the economy. This shitstorm and volatility would then increase the value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:22:31
The problem I have is that Coinbase doesn't let you move or sell your bitcoin for 5 days after you make a purchase. Just gotta hope they don't run off with my coins before I move it to my wallet!
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:39:58
Here's my upvote
@_date: 2019-08-12 09:34:25
Exactly right. I'm 26 so I can afford the risk. I did have $20,000 in shares but sold them Sept 2018 just before the Oct-Dec slump (luckily). I guess I will eventually buy shares again but not while the market is overvalued. I just don't have the confidence in the stock market like I used to

Quick update. I got my Trezor wallet today after buying it yesterday with next day delivery. Works like a charm
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:18:36
I didn't mean for it to look like I'm flexing. What I meant was that over the coming years, the amount I'll have invested will dwarf the $2,000 I forgot to invest this month
@_date: 2019-08-25 09:30:42
Trezor or ledger. Simple
@_date: 2019-08-09 12:31:07
And it's not just the risk of being hacked (fairly low risk imo. It's how they can suspend trading at the drop of a hat. When bitcoin dropped 10% in like 5 minutes about a month ago, coinbase stopped all transactions and you couldn't access your account. When the shit hits the fan you'll be happy that your bitcoin are safe in a wallet

@_date: 2019-06-22 11:33:43
My only issue is that I don't have my Trezor wallet yet and holding my bitcoin on Coinbase. So I don't really want to drop a stack while I'm waiting for my wallet. I'd rather be safe.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:22:51
That's a good point. I guess it makes me feel a little better
@_date: 2019-06-15 13:08:55
Thank you. And at least in these fields there are plenty of online courses you can sink your teeth into. I'll have a look over the coming weeks at some "how to get into _____" books see which area may suit what exactly I'm wanting to get into
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:51:38
Oh no I mean I don't have a wallet at all and holding it in Coinbase. So that's why I'm waiting for a Trezor wallet so I can buy with Coinbase and move it over to a secure wallet
@_date: 2019-08-02 11:33:40
But $30 isn't a lot to learn this lesson early. If this happened down the line and $300 was lost, the OP would wish he'd learned that lesson earlier

So stop spamming this until this happens

I had the same problem when I sent all my bitcoins to my Trezor wallet and it blocked the transaction. I sent a picture of my drivers license and it was all verified in 15 minutes luckily. Otherwise I wouldn't have slept well tonight

That's exactly what I'll be doing over the weekend. Looking at what I spend money on and the money saved will go into bitcoin. So I'm not exactly 'buying bitcoin' I'm just moving my spending from one thing to another
@_date: 2019-06-17 22:58:22
Is it fairly straightforward transferring bitcoin from Coinbase to a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:02:59
Kinda yeah. Government workers tend to get a lot of flexibility with work hours. It was to give a bit more context to my situation in regards to potential time dedicated to studying.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:19:58
That's smart. I'm at just under 10% but was looking to go up to 15% tomorrow (looks like I just missed the big push to 10,000 But oh well)

Sorry I may have misunderstood what that Razor thing is that people on here talk about. You know the whole "not your keys not your bitcoin" etc
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:39:25
It's looking unlikely
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:29:16
Or a better answer; if you stick to the same amount (£100 every month for example) then when the price of bitcoin goes up then you're buying less. So when the price goes down you're buying more
@_date: 2019-09-04 11:26:52
The reason why altcoins talk about why their coin is better is because they need to convince themselves and others to invest. It may come from a point of arrogance, but bitcoiners don't need to harp on about why we're better because to us it's a non-contest
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:04:13
Just guessing, but the other coins often increase/decrease when bitcoin does. So if bitcoin goes up, often etherium does too
