I’m a Bitcoin skeptic but I try to be open minded. I challenge you to convince me why Bitcoin is worth 50 (or more) dollars. I’m not trying to be a dick. I want your opinion.

That’s not really a good comparison. People bartered with salt (or any goods) because there was no stable and reliable currency to use. Precious metal coins offered a marked advance because of their ability to lower the cost of transactions and increase trade (i.e you would just carry around a bag of coins instead of your bags and bags of salt so you could travel farther and trade for anything with coins not just with people who wanted salt). Just because something is new doesn’t make it better. If Bitcoin can reduce transaction costs and make trading of value easier compared to fiat then great. However, I haven’t seen any evidence that is the case therefore I remain a Bitcoin sceptic.

Why is one bitcoin worth 50 (or more dollars)?

It is so utterly ironic how you just basically proved what’s holding bitcoin back from actually being a currency. It can’t be both a growth investment vehicle and a medium of exchange.

But you’re still sending your bits to another person for an exchange of goods or services, right? And those bits have a value determined by the market and economy those bits support? It’s a currency...

Wow....this article is riddled with inaccuracies and facile arguments. Not to mention it’s the GOLD Telegraph saying how the dollar is failing and gold will rule again. That’s like reading a pamphlet on why you need a new car given to you by a car dealer.
