I like Frozen CPU.  I've purchased a lot of water cooling stuff from them over the years.  I'm glad to see they are still around and appear to have grown over the years even though, to be perfectly honest, I feel like they are a pretty niche market vendor.

Can I ask why we are using a law written literally &gt; 200 years ago?  I feel like that, in and of itself, is basically just grounds for throwing out the whole thing.  We hadn't even really gotten to a point of understanding the principles of electricity in 1789.
Perhaps I'm out of the loop, but the whole thing is a giant fallacy in my eyes.

You may very well be correct on this.  I'm guessing that either:
1. They are making a stink about nothing.
2. They feel like it's bad publicity if anyone were to ever know that they did this
3. They don't want to set a precedent without fighting it first.
4. They really don't trust that, if they were to build something for just one phone, someone could get hold of it and exploit it.
Those are the only things I can think of as possible reasons listed as most to least likely.

I think the main thing here is, simply put, you can't just give one "backdoor" into one phone.  It's either part of the encryption software on the device or it isn't.  Meaning that it's either on all devices or none and it would have had to have been put in place prior to the encryption on the device itself.

Bank of America sent me a five dollar check in the mail this morning as a class action settlement.  I'm confused because, not only did that account ever go in the red while it was open (I no longer have any accounts with them) but even if I did $5 seems like small beans compared to what they seem to bone people with.
