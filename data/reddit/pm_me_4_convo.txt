yeah but like, there was a point in time where bitcoin was a "currency" relegated to the dark corners of the web for silk road and shit. What made it mainstream pseudo stock all of a sudden?

S-curve, thats interesting. I'll have to research that a bit more, as I've never heard of it. Thanks!

It's pretty mainstream, at least among younger people. Most people in my class have heard of bitcoin, and a fair portion from that have either bought, mined or sold bitcoin. That being said, holy shit yeah it was five years ago, I have a horrible perception of time.

So you're saying it just kinda snowballed? I haven't been looking at community size (although that might be a better factor to compare), but just looking at the search term bitcoin, or buy bitcoin over time, the surge has been near exponential. ( Usually, at least in my limited experience, there is always a catalyst of some sort to influence this kind of growth. Like legit a few years ago bitcoin was relegated as some kind of shitty silk road shady deal, with no practical application aside from the deep web or one the sandwhich shop that accepted them. I just can't imagine this overnight popularity.
