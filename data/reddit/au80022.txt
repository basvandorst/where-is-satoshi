Let's just say you were poor but then all a sudden all your money is in crypto, now what?

I have been in a long time.  If you don't have some buy some now.  Then buy a small amount every month.

At some point ... the dollars sitting in that bank are going to be so big, I wonder what will happen?

This is why I prefer coinami

Bitcoin has been around for ten years now, so as far as memes go, the general public knows about Bitcoin now.  I had random friends asking their timeline's if they got into Bitcoin, and most hadn't really heard about it.
That being said, when your government currency starts degrading like the situations in South America, Greece and the like, Bitcoin and other faster, more fully featured, yet risky undertested crypto currencies, gold and silver start being more important for each individuals personal savings in times of chaos.

I sold all my Bitcoin the kept every other cryptocurrency because I got mad at how Bitcoin core handled the fork and scaling. I decided that my best course of action would be to not have any steak and Bitcoin anymore because I did not like how they were being run. I think that is the best way too vote with your money by removing my money from their pool of market cap. I would love to see any cryptocurrency work and make sure that I have a little bit of the ones that are legitimately proof of work or a good privacy coin or a good proof of stake coin like ethereum but I'm not into the political stuff that happened to Bitcoin in the way that it was destroyed.  in my mind Bitcoin cash, is the true version of Bitcoin and works better confirmed faster and overall is just more pleasurable to work with then how horrible Bitcoin has been managed. This is my opinion and obviously we are talking about a decentralized currency that anyone can be involved with so some of these people found a way to get lots of power and let the Illuminati destroy Bitcoin from within.

Agreed, we all get Bitcoin, and Peter is bumbling around not understanding.

Split, and sell your bch if you don't like it

I wish I bought tethers when Bitcoin hit 20k and I think I would be happy with buying in right now.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:46:46
That's fair, if they can actually succeed, that coin was trash any way
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:48:30
I think there comes a time when Bitcoin and crypto could start destabilizing fiat to an extent as it gets larger and larger.

Yet both in name is accurate, because legalizing marijuana would in fact make America great again.

Ya, definitely true, its hard to proselytize Bitcoin sometimes just because its so early, but it definitely changed my life.
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:10:49
Say " SATs" but say it with a southern drawl. Almost sounds like " cents".  Problem solved.
@_date: 2019-01-20 21:02:47
I mean this isn't necessarily true.  Some people got these coins for like ten bucks a pop.
@_date: 2019-01-01 01:57:04
Its really hard to recommend to people Bitcoin when it loses 85 percent of its value every time it crashes.  It's done it many times, and you can see on the chart how bitcoin crashes, comes back than goes exponential.

I have a coinbase and a shift card.  Already paying sales tax and conversion and cc fees.  This is reasonable legislation.
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:50:58
The only thing better about bitcoin is it's market cap and popularity.  Technically it is the most secure.  It is also the slowest.
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:23:21
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:37:36
That's what happens now already

The concept of taxes is what's broken

Monero? What Monero?
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:12:05
Ya that too lol
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:11:57
Or any altcoins...  I have enjoyed coinomi, thoroughly.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:10:03
If another drop happens tomorrow, I'll be that much more issues to it too and I'll be more hardened as well
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:39:40
Sell all Bitcoin for monero.

No, that is the best position in the entire industry to have.
