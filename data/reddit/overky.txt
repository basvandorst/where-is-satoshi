It'll be destroyed before it has the opportunity to significantly affect govts.

How do you think China's reaction will affect btc in a few hours?
@_date: 2017-03-18 03:02:06
I am relatively new to bitcoin and have seen these kinds of plans several times. Needless to say, I'm pretty skeptical but intrigued. I assume they are a scam but I don't know enough about them to  call it either way. I would love someone to shed some light on this.

Can you store in more than one location to make it safer? If I put it on my phone, can I also put it on my computer or a thumbdrive?
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:39:30
I bought my first BTC a week ago...and then a few more times during the rise......and now it's all devalued hah.  Oh well.  Based on what I've seen, I'll just have to be patient and let it rise again.  So far, I only have about .5 BTC invested though.  Admittedly, that's a bit for me, but not enough to make me go hungry.   I'm honestly not sure whether I should convert to USD now, let it drop more and then buy again....or if I should just sit patiently and smile.    I keep trying to avoid the temptation to cash out and run and try to picture the long time.   
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:59:39
hah....great reply
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:57:34
It all crashed the moment Coinbase crashed....I think people flipped out and got scared
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:36:47
I'm very new to this...only made my first purchase a few days ago before everything started to climb so rapidly.  I've been reading and watching everything I can get my hands on...but alas there are only so many hours in a day and I still have an infinite number of questions which need answers :)
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:52:22
Where are the coins when they lose them (like in a hard drive crash)?  Do they just fly off into the ether never to be seen again?
@_date: 2017-01-09 05:20:29
web bot? lol
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:09:10
Yet it dropped the very moment of the crash?
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:51:54
Lol....I might take you up on that.  The biggest questions I have this very moment pertain to how to properly analyze the graphs and data I see on GDAX.  I've managed to pick up quite a bit, but I'm still trying to incorporate the significance of some of the info --- such as the importance of the spread and the volume.  I understand what they mean, I just don't understand yet the significance of their change and values.  
I'm also trying to better understand the candle graph as multiple values are being displayed but I don't know what some of them are or how to interpret their relevance.
I could easily pick someone's brain for a few min with very specific questions --- but learning is the fun part.  I'd lose interest if I wasn't learning lots of new stuff quickly :)
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:48:43
Yet the price didn't do a mega drop until Coinbase's servers crashes.  I think it was just a hypersensitive bubble and Coinbase and their inability to run servers properly, popped the bubble.  Everyone got scared.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:52:19
Ideally, that's not *my* point.  Other than learning for fun (which is my initial motivation), my point is to profit short and long term.
As for "so what".....that's an odd question.  It's because I want to learn and better understand the dynamics affecting the btc market.  That's what :)
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:25:53
But it kinda looked like they were the ones who precipitated the crash yesterday when the prices fell immediately after Coinbase went offline.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:12:51
....but maybe I'll buy back later when/if it gets lower
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:03:00
Again, thanks....you've clarified a bunch of points which will let me move forward.  GDAX has been the main place I've been visiting over the past few days...but now that I've poked around on Bitcoinwisdom, I see it's pretty awesome as well.  
Lots to learn....and I'm grateful to the folks like you who are willing to spread a bit of wisdom :)  thanks again!!
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:54:08
I don't know the hodl guy but I do get your point.  For the most part, I'm just playing until I better learn the ropes.  I'd like to think that I'm in it for the long run though.
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:44:16
What exactly is it that they're calculating?  What are these tough math problems?
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:07:12
Oh man...thanks so much.  I read your description several times while looking closely at GDAX and comparing the info.  I have a much, much better understanding now.  There was a lot that simply wasn't sinking in....but your clarified it for me :)
I definitely didn't understand the wicks or the fact that the candles represented beginning and ending prices for the specified time period.
Last thing(s), please --
What are the red and grey line graphs  on the candle graph?  I thought I knew what they were, but now it's clear to me that I simply don't lol  Likewise, what do the gray bars at the bottom represent?  I had assumed they represented volume, but I don't think that's the case :)  Then again, maybe they do represent volume.
Again, thanks for tossing some tips my way.  
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:27:19
where do you suggest
@_date: 2017-01-07 04:44:20
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:47:25
I think I mined a 50 cents worth or something years ago -- and laughed at it thinking it wasn't worth my time.  I donated it to someone haha.
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:01:34
I assumed as much -- didn't think there was a BTC reincarnation with an afterlife :)
@_date: 2017-01-07 20:46:55
I love the picture -- and it makes a very clear point :)
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:12:13
Thanks for the advice haha...I only lost 10%
@_date: 2017-01-07 19:46:11
So at what point will you finally sell, do you think?  2000? 5000? 20,000? :)  Hanging onto btc could be just as impulsive as wanting to sell.  
When I was first enraptured by the quick increase over the past week, I was daydreaming that I was going to begin putting 10% of my income into it.  I still probably will as I've never had any other investment.  But then question comes up, "for how long"? 
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:08:01
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:33:52
Thanks so much for that VERY clear and concise explanation.  I'm a noob and this makes much sense to me.  I appreciate it ;)
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:17:00
and damnit, I just dropped another grand right at the peak hahah
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:22:03
That's why I chose bitcoin long ago as the vehicle for me to learn investing.  The rate of change is so high that I can see in days or minutes what takes conventional investing months or years.  I would be bored with conventional stock trading.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:19:21
yeah, I won't be selling either....just always adding
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:35:09
That's the 12 word seed created by Multibit HD, right?  I do have that....not sure what I should be doing with it though....thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-10 06:04:37
No idea...so just now I created this....  
Feel free to join and add your thoughts :)
@_date: 2017-09-03 08:10:51
I keep doing that....exactly that (see my original msg) and absolutely nothing happens.  Clearly I'm doing something wrong.
