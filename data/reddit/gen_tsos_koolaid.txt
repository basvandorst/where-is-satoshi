Can we stop these dumb "this is why we need x-coin. It's gonna change everything" posts?
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:00:21
Other threads exist. Your post is worthless. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 02:23:52
This made me giggle.
Have an upvote.
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:03:46
Upvoted. I like creative posts like this.

That seems to be it. Thank you.

Harrow bicboi.

Absolutely! However, the issue at hand is all of that needs to be or is already being developed.  A good comparison for blockchain/smart contracts would be like the Internet in 1994/1995. It's still the beginning.

I'm not going to take my time to click a video with such a title.
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:53:15
He just mad.

Here's an idea for identity on the blockchain. I really hope something like this comes to fruition. I would love an encrypted hash of my info vs a plain text social security number.

Not gonna type that shit out bro. No one is buying with crypto.

It's not though. It's ice cream that's always hard and never soft/creamy/easy to scoop compared to other brands. Their flavors are boring as well.

Tone Vays is still alive? I have heard/read that name since 2016.

What website is this?
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:27:18
That website will tell you how many Satoshi's needed for your transaction. If you're not in a hurry, you can use 1-5 Satoshi to get in anywhere from 0-7 blocks. 6-10 Satoshi to get into the next block or 2.

Ok guys, you see this response? It means the stoopid money is back.
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:16:11
To add to what you said, it's about freedom from corporate money. You are your own bank with Bitcoin. The bank that holds your money can keep you from withdrawing it or can seize your money regardless of reason. Government's inflate their currency to the point of worthlessness(Venezuela). Bitcoin's code can be viewed and audited by anyone. You can't do that with government money(US federal reserve). It's so people can be in control of their finances, not the other way around.
I'm sure I'm missing stuff, but that's the gist of reading r/cryptocurrency and r/Bitcoin for 2+ years.

If your hairdresser never heard of bitcoin, they don't have enough money to invest/401k/ROTH.
It's not that shocking.
@_date: 2019-06-08 02:26:54
Downvoted for being right. That's ok though, take my upvote.
@_date: 2018-06-04 05:22:35
This is the proper answer.

Here's the first post from 5 years ago - 
Here's the updated traveler post - 
An article about citadels - 
As of now I can't find it on mobile, but there was a Reddit post a few days ago mentioning that Binance and Coinbase are the top two exchanges used, which confirms the second travelers mention of that being the case.
Edit: spelling.

If you can find a bitcoin ATM near you, you can print their public key and send it there.
The Bitcoin ATM will scan the public key QR code and send it from the atm.

So then would this mean that any arbitrary data that existed when Litecoin was created/forked from BTC and BCash are potentially at risk?
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:11:23
Thank you for explaining.
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:24:44
Bingo. That's exactly what I got that post.

So you can pay taxes on your taxes! Doesn't this still count as a capital gains transfer/cash out?
