The problem is bitcoin sucks as a currency. That is not steams fault but have fun on your self masturbatory crusade. I'll keep using steam till I die because nothing else is even half as good as their client.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:07
Member when litecoin was added? It doubled in 24 hours. I dont see anything strange going on. There is real dissent towards how bitcoin is being handled and bch offers an outlet for that dissent.
I should note i don't have a dog in this fight i just want a cryptocurrency that is safe from multi national coordinated attacks.

No one chain can ever have it all. The are trade offs that must be made in design. Monero will never compromise on privacy whereas BTC can and will sacrifice that for certain trade offs like scaling. Says a lot about your knowledge on the topic if you think specialized wallets will keep you private as safe as monero. Coinjoins eventually turn into honeypots and given that these guys are building an llc around this means shit for resisting law enforcement or other violent agencies.
Also check out monero scaling progress. 
You can say BTC will be big daddy for world SOV and day to day commerce and I would agree with you but I seriously doubt it will ever be able to compete on a level of privacy with monero because to monero everything else is secondary and to btc privacy is an afterthought both have chosen their distinctive niches and will coexist in the marketplace.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:09:06
Yeah but this is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-04 04:53:17
Read it again. Wallet level coinjoin is not even remotely similar to protocol level privacy. In fact the differences are so large the only way you could conflate the two is through willful ignorance. Pearls and swine i guess.

I thought it was pretty funny but i agree with you. Youve gotta go to niche focused forums, subreddits, and ircs to get the good stuff now. Anything that touches mainstream conciousness just has a massive drop in quality.

I think 5 years is offensively low. These guys are probably 10-20 years ahead of commercial in most things they pursue. They have tons of money. Does anyone remember when they gave nasa the two satellites that had been sitting in a warehouse for a decade, unused.
edit: the telescopes were from the 70's, did i read that right?
Last sentence of wiki page if tl;dr
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:14:01
Privacy isnt optional in monero. Bitcoin could never compete on a similar level unless it forced every transaction to be private and that will never happen.
@_date: 2019-03-06 23:25:47
No its not. Its just another example in a long line of failure that people will point to and proclaim crypto a scam.

It does if they are looking at distributed databasing. There are many benefits to such a system. That said healthcare is notoriously slow at changing IT, for good reason, it will be one of the last sectors to use blockchain tech, if it does at all.

This is crypto. You cannot and should not trust anyone. Go back and make SURE the API you gave them was read access only. You can't know that there isn't some some exploit or hack that can bypass 2fa. Cover your ass.

Good lord that is pretty terrifying to think about.
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:18:08

It is why the fed gets so panicky about preventing deflation of the USD. Why would you spend a $1 today when it is worth $1.05 tomorrow?

Stocks are a bubble. U.s. housing market is in a bubble. Bonds have pathetically low interest rates, and I'm not about to fuck with precious metals when bitcoin is so similar and 1000x easier to buy and store.
Crypto it is! I'm gonna ride this wave for a other year or two then diversify across all asset classes but for now I'm young enough that the risk reward is acceptable to me.
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:36:57
Yep. This time next year shitcoin is gonna be all the rage. In just 12 months they will figure out how to solve the scaling issue that other people have spent a decade working on. Shit devs ftw.

This is false.
Even the most egalitarian countries in the world like scandinavia still have huge gender divides in careers like STEM vs Nursing. Everything else equal genders still have their predispositions.
Would you find it odd to say that more men love MMA than women? I would hope not.
I do agree that most men, including me, are poorly socialized around women but the lack of women in STEM is not because of that.

I passively observed BTC for years before getting involved. Been trading and holding since late 2014. I still didnt really 'get it' until i watched this video. I've always had hype, but man listening to him talk gave me something else. Can't say what it is exactly except maybe i would call it, hope.
I've listened to it fully through several times now and i still get goosebumps every time.
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:45:59
Hahaha. The answer is no one!
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:59:00
It's dangerous to assume we will get this. This is something all of us will have to fight and work towards. Good post otherwise.
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:10:21
Depends on how young they are. Stocks are at an all time high, interest rates on bonds and treasuries are about as low as they can go. Peter Schiff who famously predicted the US housing bubble three years before it happened says our housing market is just as fucked you as before if not more so, so equities can be considered a shitty investment too.
I'd say go for it. I'm %100 percent crypto and only pull profits to pay off debt and keep 9 months salary in the bank. Working just fine for me.
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:10:43
But the stock market has never been more expensive. Also take into account we never really recovered from the last recession, the economy is more sick now than it was in 2009. Personally my plan is to ride the crypto wave until the stock market has it's correction then I'll diversify. This next recession will be brutal and we are likely to further see the dollar slip from it's spot as the world currency. I can't think of a better position to be in than btc and other blue Chip currencies and tokens.

The dollar is inflating at a rate of 50% every ten years. I'm getting out as much as I can. The debt is unsustainable. Historically cutting interest rates has been how the fed combats recession but we're still below 2%. Wages are down. Purchasing power is down. People are working two jobs and barely getting by. The banks we're bailed out of their last fuck up, no one went to jail, no lessons we're learned. Companies are sitting on historic inventory highs. We are not healthy. We have politicians who refuse to let the country actually go through a correction/recession, no one wants it to happen on their watch. Bush kicked the can down the road to Obama, Obama kicked the can down to the road to trump, can trump kick the can down the road? Recessions historically happen. Every nine years. We're coming up on that soon. There are no economic indicators that give me any faith at all in the health of this country.
If you want I can link to the different talks and discussions that led to me forming this opinion. It's a few hours worth of material, All YouTube stuff, the lectures are given by some big names in the finance world, Peter Schiff, nassim taleb, etc. I'm in Mobile now but when I can get a few mins on a PC I'll post the links.

Idk why there is so much hate and vitriol around this. The tribalism I am seeing is so petty and reminds me of the same dumb mofos who argue about Allah vs Yahweh​.
Forking is an essential part of blockchains and imo is one of it's most beautiful features because it creates an environment where darwinism can play out when consensus cannot be reached.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:59:13
Your right that it's not unique, forking is just another way of saying software update. But also consider that the blockchain was the first implementation to answer the Byzantine fault problem. While not quite unique it is arguably distinctive.
