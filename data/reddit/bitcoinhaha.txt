Here's your reminder, idiot!
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:20:05
What do you mean? Why does the price keep,going down? Aren't you scared?
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:50:56
Of course it is. It's in a bubble.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:56:17
Except what if it doesnt? I'm seriously getting worried sick
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:40:07
I'll do $5000
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:33:32
It's a bubble. It will never see $5000 again. Ever. You should have sold your coins and locked in your profits while you had a chance instead of being greedy little pigs.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:33:45
What the heck? I'm serious. It went to 5000! Now it's below 4000!
