My gut feeling says that there are some big fish who have been using the current bearish market to their advantage and have been loading up some coins for a while now at the &lt;7k$ levels.
If some big parties are interested in buying in this is the time. Buy while everyone is selling and the price will not move that much. So you can rake in big amount without skyrocketing the price.

Don't gamble your money away in "other crypto" is my best advice i can give you. Seems like you don't have much to spare so be wise with the few soldiers you have.
It's not that difficult though about a fraction:
1 bitcoin  = 7000$ //
0.1 bitcoin = 700$ //
0.01 bitcoin = 70$ // 
0.001 bitcoin = 7$ // 
0.0001 bitcoin = 0.7$ //
@_date: 2018-09-11 17:20:34

News is not manipulation, they are just wrong. As they are already for decades. Ever watched "news" about the stock market? 
Show me some proof that there is manipulation, prices itself say nothing. That is just the market panicking over this like you obviously also do. Markets are not always right (like some economists believe) and they don't move always rationally. Look from yesterday rejection, before the SEC "manipulated" the market down but now the market doesn't even care anymore, instead it goes up!

No. Not in many ways.
They cant freeze your accounts anymore, they can't deny you banking service, they can't put ridiculous rules on you, no bail in possible, they can't inflate your coins and if you really don't like them you remember those 12 words and hop on to a country which seems to like you more.
@_date: 2018-09-17 08:16:55
Yes, but many people take everything for granted so they basically buy worthless things while thinking they own something :) 
@_date: 2018-09-08 17:39:45
Nope. Check the daily trading volume and the coins added by miners nowadays. It is just a needle in the bitcoin haystack.
Let say it cost miners 6k$ to mine 1 bitcoin, what is stopping us (the market) for selling at 2k a piece? The float of tradeable bitcoins is setting prices not miners.

Can you explain why though?
@_date: 2018-09-25 13:38:43
You don't need much. You could buy just 5$ worth of bitcoin, or even less. Firstly buy just a small bit and send it around, create some wallet (Electrum or samourai wallet for example). 
You could buy the bitcoin at an exchange (Kraken, coinbase, bitstamp or any other mabye in your country). Sign up and send a little bit of money. Or buy bitcoin in a local ATM or at localbitcoin.com.
Some good sources are  or read the book "the bitcoin standard" (highly recommended you get a crash course in everything you need to know!).
Oh and do not fall for the bcash (BCH) scam! Also don't go for a "quick return" to some vague alt coin which give you a lot of promises but not really anything else.
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:50:24
Yes i understand, but it is not zero sum.
Who lost trillions on the rising house market? Who lost trillions on rising stock market? If everything goes up it doesn't mean someone is losing (can be but its not the rule). Because it aren't zero sum games. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 12:45:59

In that documentary they even showed how they send stocks with a special kind of trading flag so that it can skip the open orders. (So they get themselves ahead in the FIFO order book). They showed it happens a lot when the stock market opens in the morning and suddenly many big orders start to flow-in and execute directly.

You make every response less sense.
But please explain me, this year it is not going well for bitcoin. Do you have paper losses or realized losses?
Yes a bear market doesn't indicate that bitcoin is bad, or something if that is what you think. If there is a bear in the housing market you are also not directly homeless are you? It just means that the numbers have changed.

@_date: 2018-09-19 17:43:48
I understand, but people have other obligations besides bitcoin. They will cash out to have some cash (cash is king). On bitcoin at the moment there is a lot of margin trading, that will vaporize at least for a period of time. People in general get into the dollar when the crash starts, even when the dollar is shit, it just happens.
So that's why i think in the short term it will get ugly for bitcoin (like for all other markets). But bitcoin keeps performing and it will be used in a much bigger scale in the end indeed.
@_date: 2018-09-24 10:07:26
A hamburger like @ Mcdolands is totaly different. But to conmplete your analogy, actually in my country they sell it at or lower than the cost price. As the price inflates but that 1$ hamburger is hard to raise the price.  I think they now raised the price level but not sure, haven't been there for years. 
Okay, so lets say miners don't sell for 2 whole months (they must have pretty big banks accounts to accomplish that). 1.8k coins times 60 = 108k coins in total. So if they don't sell for two whole months their total supply what they can sell still only count for 15% of ONE DAY TRADING! It is merely a drop of water in an Olympic size swimming pool.
And they can't stop mining either because there is always someone that gets mined those bitcoin anyway (it's how the rules are made). As you can see they have close to zero % influence on the price those days. The bitcoin pricing mechanism is purely from open market trading.

In my country the government took over and supported some banks in the last crisis. Now they all make a killing again with huge profits (even while they are paying a fine here and there). Of course the "debts" are "paid" and now they can keep the profit and once again share huge profits with the high ranked employees.
They next crisis will be no different than the last, nothing has changed.

Hi, i have been in Armenia a couple years ago. It's a beautiful country and i would gladly come back one day, really enjoyed my time there!
Bitcoin-adoption as in daily payments? 
I think what you could/should do is spreading the idea of bitcoin. I'm not sure anymore how strong your currency is, do you have high inflation? Maybe spread the idea that bitcoin is to protects people's wealth from inflation (although that's a bit of a hard sell in 2018 when it fell a lot, although that actually makes a perfect buy). If people start to use it as an store of value, like you probably use now usd or eur for that, it is good if there is an extra option.
You told there aren't really bitcoin related businesses, why not? Maybe try to influence people to start this. Start something like pay with bitcoin in Jeravan. Or distribute more atms. Make exchange office or payment options for tourist in bitcoin. So there is no local online platform where you can buy bitcoin?
I think you really just should look at what other countries are doing and copy the good ideas. Or be the Andreas of Armenia and spread/influence the idea. If no one is doing it yet it means there are great opportunities, for sure some people would love to help you!
I think legislation is out of your league, it will be much easier to be "accepted" when bitcoin is already in use. Try to be on the gray side of what is allowed and what isn't (if that is possible in your country). 
@_date: 2018-09-10 09:44:55
I don't know where you live but in my country the price of bread rises not because of scarcity but because money becomes worth less.
The baker needs to raise prices because otherwise he will live under the bridge.
Actually funny because supermarket bread isn't all that expensive because supermarkets have power over the super bakeries to demand cheap bread. So real economics at play no? Cheap bread for consumers, many trades at the supermarket at low margins and a bakery who need to work full time for extreme tiny margins.

True, but in email there were basically only advantages.
With money the central banks already got digital money. They an also implement some kind of "blockchain". The majority of people is okay with a "little" inflation, they are so brain washed they think it is needed. Often i read here how banks always need to exist because who else is going to give mortgages to them, they only know the debt system.
Post offices went away without a fight, don't expect fiat currencies, banks or central banks to go out of business without a big nasty fight.

@_date: 2018-09-24 08:56:02
No it isn't and it never will be.
The open market sets the price and not any miner. If they mine bitcoin for 2x the market price they simple need to stop wasting money and buy them from the open market instead.
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:12:24
It is true,  its like the total of 1 hour worth of trading..
@_date: 2018-09-10 09:59:55
Yes i understand. But be aware that no one really knows when/or what the bottom is.
But if you feel yourself comfortable at buying at such prices of today and you just have the trust and ability to keep your bitcoin while it goes lower nothing really can go wrong.
I'm pretty okay when bitcoin would go down from here another 20% and i would likely buy more.
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:27:37
Which country and which system? Anyway, most of the world doesn't and it works fine.
In most EU countries cash transactions are a fraction of the total amount.
Scale isn't the most important factor for bitcoin. Would you rather see 10.000 tps or a safe system? I would rather see the latter. If safety doesn't matter we could rather ask a central banker to buy some more computer hardware and make everything instant.

Nice purchase though!
Do you really really need the money? Maybe you can get a temp job or hussle for money? Do you still believe in bitcoin? Why sell now after it dropped 70% (yes easy to say now, i know). Do you think it will go back up and would you then hate yourself for selling?
I think you need to get straight why you want to sell and then make a decision. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 09:14:34
Those ideas i also have and it made me extreme bullish on bitcoin.
Check your broker account though, one broker isn't the same as the other in those terms anyway!
The idea that the government (or whatever bad party) can just turn of your livelihood with nothing more than a button is very scary to me. And i suspect we will see that more and more the upcoming years. Also the government has been trying hard to make it possible to interfere with pension funds money. So that if a crash happen they can freeze there activity, making it impossible for them to sell and profit from the new arrived opportunity!
The idea that you just can remember 12 words and walk across any border and start a new life make me think this asset is still way undervalued in that kind of way.

Yes true, but some things you can't buy directly and its good to have some reserve too. Most assets can decrease sharply in the short term (like bitcoin went up 12 months ago and now is back at that level again). Those who bought in December and now need to cash out could have better let it inflate 10 years in the bank.
@_date: 2018-09-01 09:30:31
BTC uses a lot of electricity indeed. But is electricity really bad? It is not bitcoins fault that a lot of countries burn coal or other bad ways to harvest electricity no? You can say that about anything, its bad to buy electronics from China as they used bad electricity to produce it.
So in that case promote green/alternative energy sources. Than you have both "good" electricity and still a secure bitcoin.

Uhm, they don't.
If what you say is true why the bitcoin isn't rising then?
There are  many millionaires. Let say 15 million (found different numbers).
So basically they can all just buy hardly 1 bitcoin. It's not even worth 1% of their assets.

Everything basically is an investment no?
Most of us invest time to get fiat too and put it away for "later" into a savings account.

Why inflation?
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:43:08
It's not because i'm a hardcore traditionalist, but more like a realist. When i go to the supermarket i see like zero procent of potential people who will use bitcoin over debitcard or cash.
My savings and credit in the bank are also cool digits.Nothing wrong with some digits who can't go away by themselves or be manipulated.
There is two ways of adoption. The payment option way (but lets be honest, for this to happen it needs to be way more widely available + easier to use). And the second way is that people start to put savings into it as the best way to preserve wealth. Or like investors who take a 1% assets into bitcoin as a hedge. I personally think firstly it will be a major way of saving/preserving. Than after the market becomes huge and way more stable people start to prefer it over using any other way of payment.
@_date: 2018-09-02 23:09:28
Here they even tax your savings, so they give zero fucks :p
The rest what you have left they inflate away.

That is already a major problem. People in 3rd world countries put savings in dollars.
Look how easy America gets wealth from inflating away poor peoples money... I lived for a while in a not so rich country and USD was the way to protect yourself from misery in the country, it is sad to see how America just generates free wealth over those hard working people :(

You should pay according to what it the fiat value.
In the Netherlands you even need to pay tax over things you use from your own company (as like an entrepreneur). Or let say you give your employees 5€ sandwiches basically its a 5€ salary so the company should at least pay that to the government as well.

I do, i dont understand why it is valued at 3x.
A house has 4 walls a roof and a floor, yes very pretty and all that stuff.
Look at businesses, they control working force, invent new things, own all kinds of property, have patents to make our lives better, etc. And yet those houses we just live in are valued way higher.

Uhm not really. Most likely the price will go down. Too many sellers out there and it will be good if some shit coins die first.
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:23:25
Guess you have to read about it somewhere, or just look at the charts.
But see it in this way, you have debts (like margin debts or other short term debts). Those need to be covered when the market is falling, so you emptied your cash account, you maybe not want or can't sell your stock, you can't sell your house quickly. The people who have gold will sell gold, even when its a safe bet which should protect them, the debts should be paid of first.
So when a crash is coming almost everything is getting sold (to get cash), then later on price increases like gold as people see it as safe heaven against cash (and maybe bitcoin this time, hard to be sure about that for now).
@_date: 2018-09-10 09:34:31
I think it doesn't kill bitcoin as bitcoin may slowly go down in the future. The system keeps working. Even when bitcoin would go back down to let say $1000. It still keeps it heart beat every ten minutes.
The interest will spark eventually again as basically it is the system which provides most trust i would say we ever seen in history. It is based on a set of rules which only can be changed when majority thinks it is the best for bitcoin.
The economy at this moment is doing well so fiat currencies and banks operate pretty neat. But we all know that the system is flawed so sooner or later there will be another financial crisis and guess who will be lurking in the dark alley with a working system.
Bitcoin will slowly start gaining trust. And money is based on trust, so it will just take time. I think there are still more busts and bubbles coming for bitcoin but the pattern keeps the same. 
You can look at stats for example from localbitcoins and in countries were inflation/banks are not doing a great job bitcoin interest is still there and growing.
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:22:51

So what better fiat on ramp then CB there is?
I used some DEX too and they are a thousand times worse than CB..
@_date: 2018-09-12 07:30:32
No its not. 
The ECB or fed (ECB even talked/thought about it) could easily create a digital coin which people start to use.
The idea of bitcoin is that its limited, unlike what other parties will bring to the table of course. And that no one is really in control. Yes in the future major holders might have a lot of power. But nothing as we have seen in the current system.
Look at US of America, they have the power to create an unlimited amount of world reserve currencies. If someone is playing the game differently they go to war and fund it with this paper money. So they can keep doing that until everyone lost the trust (which still is not the case).
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:30:11

@_date: 2018-09-10 09:52:00
I think actually it is not even so bad to compare it in that way.
You can't really value it in any way.
So the market cap is an indicator of how people trust bitcoin. Because if trust rises people put more fiat money into bitcoin so the price rises.
@_date: 2018-09-28 08:39:31
In short time you can make a larger amount indeed, but you gotta have some luck with it! It is called speculation/gambling.

@_date: 2018-09-19 15:32:35
Yes, but most likely it will take a hit first. There is a lot of speculation and borrowed money into it. So those need to get out first, after that new money starts rushing in and a big flood of money searching for safety can come in. 
But still most people don't really understand/trust bitcoin, so it is very hard to have any idea at the moment.

Is it that hard to understand?
Nowadays they can freeze your bank/investment accounts with merely a click on a button. So if a government has something against a person they freeze all his accounts.
With that the problems really emerge quickly, imagine if from today all your assets are frozen. How long you will survive?
So with holding your assets in bitcoin they lost the ability to financially suppress you. That feature is way more important than you seem to realize.

If 1000's of bitcoins are at a stop loss if price goes through 7000$ you get a massive sale. Bots and algo's react also to that and in minutes you are 10% down.

When i travel abroad the first question people ask if i tell them my country is about weed... Why would all those people care while its illegal and i don't care why it is legal? Government can punish people put not change people.
Yes in your case many people would give in, but don't think that mankind gives in because of government wants. Than you didn't really watched history closely enough i suppose.
Anyway never will all governments agree with each other and there will be always bitcoin paradise somewhere. So capital will move to those places. You don't think capital will move? Check Jim Rogers, or you think he is the only one? Check again.
I understand that your case will be a major set back for bitcoin and will make it way harder. But the genie is out of the bottle, they should have acted directly, now too many people have tasted this tech and it is just too late for your "plan" of action.

I'm getting extremely bullish on the fact that it really is still early. People who should know better are ignorant (but probably they lost any need for real security as they put themselves already in a good potion throughout their life, they are settled pretty well and securely).
But even in the bitcoin (crypto for all those who are really lost) community i still see that many people have the slightest idea of how revolutionary it is!
It is pretty ironic how they don't thrust mankind's biggest thrust system.

As i said, the EU is still printing more than those miners create per day at $500k a coin. And that is already taking into account a 50% cut from earlier.
A billion a day isn't that much. Yes currently it still is for bitcoin, but things can change (although not very likely in 2019 :) )
@_date: 2018-09-13 22:47:21
That is market working no?
Higher interest means lower capital risk, which lowers the capital outflow, which lowers the pressure on the selling side, which end up being a positive for the exchange rate..
Even if you take out the exchange rate countries still fail. Look in Europe, now many countries are under one currency and it still doesn't work.

What i think they do is they use the pro version as liquidity pool. So let say people who buy on the normal coinbase they buy instantly for high fees and they can use the pro market to fill those orders.
It's only for markers, so they are in need of market makers. I think the taker fee even on pro is like .3% or something.

Yea true, don't know some believe every actor in this space is bad and every event is manipulated somehow. 
I think Coinbase has a pretty fat bank account though. It takes time for fiat to arrive at the exchange and not all people use it only to exchange directly, many would wait for good opportunities to happen or just arbitrage etc.
As far as i remembered at CB the most coins are in cold storage (so if they do it correctly those should be safe). The float of hot wallets is insured in case they might lose those. So i'm not the one who says the FDIC insured fiat is better than the coins.
Also i am now thinking is those fiat insured also for non American non USD accounts?

It can go both ways, same as you buy bitcoin it can just go down as well.
Price changes and shorts like this doesn't really matter. Although i can agree with short sellers at this point, it is most likely to go down in short the term.

And on paper they hold it on the price they bought instead of fair market value (not even taking into account the huge risk involved if they need to sell, maybe they can get like 50% of todays price).
Nice accounting gimmick they pulled here.

What are you talking about? You can easily put 1-2 sat transactions through.
A couple weeks back i paid 25 euro for a bank transaction from Norway to EUR bank account. That was not even a premium service. I would take the safer bitcoin transactions at current cost all day over banks.

What stops someone from taking cash and saying there hasn't been made a payment?
@_date: 2018-09-30 10:58:33
My bank charge close to that at foreign atm's.
I think it is 1.5% conversion fee (inlcuding Mastercard) and a minimum of 4.5 euro for every withdrawal. Often you can only get 100-200 euro abroad, so than that fixed fee starts killing you.

True. I use both and would really like to see more options for LN payments, they go pretty smooth.
For on chain transactions i take the time or i pay high fees if needed, not really a big problem indeed.

In your story everything you don't own (anymore) you lose money on.
Paper loses/gains don't continue when you sold your item/asset. Opportunity cost maybe. But for sure if i sell my bitcoin at a profit i am just out of the game. But from that point the game can rise without me and i lose nothing as i'm out already.

@_date: 2018-09-06 13:51:04
But is is not a squeeze! 
Check the time when you opened the post (people were opening positions). Check the price now and see the difference.
So if people now close the position (hence the decline), they just took a profit on the way down.
Nothing fancy.

Hmm not really sure. Majority of people still and will keep believing in "the system".
Look at Europe right now, it is one big mess. The Euro is still "strong". But they printed trillions and still are printing. Fake created inflation started to get higher and interest is at zero.
Still everything is going.

How you can pay with a card and not let anyone know who you are? You understand that (most likely) your card is in your name and they can track everything you purchase and where/when.
If you want to purchase anonymously you need to think carefully (depending how anonymous you want them) about your purchases. Localbitcoin might be an option, maybe in your country there are some good options, there should be bitcoin ATM's too.
@_date: 2018-09-21 08:50:28
No as i always send free bitcoin from coinbase (withdrawal). And it is as fast as the network is, normally i have no problem as coinbase seem to send enough fees with each transaction.

They put effort as they just could take the coins and move to the tropics and sip Margarita's for the rest of their lives.
So why they should even let people make this claims then, if they don't intent to go further then that? There is no logic in your thinking, is it?
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:04:58
Yes but everything "moves" any market price in the very short term. It only almost never (like in this case) is a real move which holds on.

@_date: 2018-09-04 10:53:58
They can't. That the price falls 5% because of China banning bitcoin has nothing to do with power. Is the price still so low? It already went back up no? It is just a temporary price swing. They can't lower it down to 0 by just keep telling they will ban it..
Its market sentiment, not the power of the government to really change anything.

I think the difference is that people want to figure out those new things. People in general aren't interested in know how finance/money/debt works. Heck the most people can barely explain it.
They just go to the bank and ask for a mortgage, it will be even hard to find someone in that bank to really explain clearly how that mortgage takes place.
So most people will only start to learn about bitcoin when they need to learn it. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:29:19

Yes, so its good. Coins are coming back from Gox too.
Which bank even just acknowledges their wrongdoings? Often they just pay a fine to wipe away the problem (a fine which they just calculate as business expense on their venture)..
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:10:44
True, but i think its more than you realize.
Here to get some idea:
When bitcoin matures more liquidity (market makers) will come into the market and such steep volatility will decrease. Now its mainly by bots and margin trading which can cause huge price swings.
@_date: 2018-09-02 11:51:12
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:24:33
Why speculative? It does exactly what it says that it does. Hodling fiat is much more speculative in the end. You know how central banks will react on the next crisis? You know what eur does against usd?
I think you looking for the word volatile. But that will decrease over time.
@_date: 2018-09-16 11:09:35
They still use the government issued paper, so they still trust it a little bit.
Fiat in the end is always doomed to fail as there are parties who abuse the trust. Because lets be honest, how many individual humans could resist the act to print free money.

It is hardly an ecological problem. It consumes less energy than traditional banking or gold mining. Of course it uses a lot of electricity but that isn't so bad as some make you believe it is.
And bitcoin doesn't mind to be mined with green energy, so focus your point then on a big percent of electricity production to be produced green instead of worrying about bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2018-09-12 08:00:42
I can vouch for that wallet, its pretty easy and fun to play with LN.

The article implies that they use customers money? For what exactly?


How is that in an open market and hundred of exchanges across the globe?


Again how is that in an open market? If bitcoin trade higher on exchange y then everyone would/could buy and x and sell at y. The difference will be gone in seconds and the supply is almost endless.


Uhm you can lend out bitcoin/usd on bitfinex and you get interest, so why bitfinex should offer this if they just can create it out of thin air?
@_date: 2018-09-07 16:48:57
Who knows man.
Split the amount in two and do both?
DCA is the best way anyway. But every week-month-quarter-whatever. You will see that the price doesn't really matter from day to day. You will not have the cheapest coins (but who does?) and you will not spent all money at 20k$ a coin. If you plan to hold long time this would be a good strategy.
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:04:21
5k$ get flagged by the government in some countries. So it isn't all that normal.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:39:32
Thats my point that it is or too complicated or you need to give in (a lot) of safety.
And if more people get in and use some wallet or app or something the rewards for trying new scams/phishing tricks goes up.
It should be both easy to use and very safely i suppose, if it will really will be used by many normal people.
@_date: 2018-09-05 08:29:42
It is now 10 years since the financial crisis. People have again started to trust banks/ central banks/ fiat currencies. The economy is booming so everything seems to be great again.
But like most people fail to see is that it is mainly driven by fake created money and that the real problems haven't been solved. So in the future a second (much bigger) financial collapse is inevitable.
Most eople now don't really understand bitcoin nor see the need for it. But one day the ATM will limit your withdrawal, government intervene in the money flow, inflation starts to raise sharply, money printing start at full speed again, banks start to fall or shut down. Then and only then bitcoin will show its real use case, normal people who know their fiat is worthless as they lost control over it want to get into bitcoin.
Greek and Cyprus crisis was just a small taste of what can happen to much bigger countries/economies. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 16:26:48
Both would be ideal. But if people buying it to store away money into bitcoin the price would already rise if more people start to do this than there are sellers out there.
@_date: 2018-09-09 19:35:26
Yea, so the market finds its ultimate price. This can be at mining cost, or 50% under or above mining cost.
@_date: 2018-09-22 18:05:25
Value doesn't arise from that only.
Instead of Bitcoin fill in: "barrel of oil", "your apple stock", "a bar of gold", "a fine piece of van Gogh".
Yes all those items have value. If not i gladly take your van Gogh :)
Even out print/use fiat money has value. Old coins, my former country currency, roman coins, Zimbabwean dollar, weimar paper.
@_date: 2018-09-17 08:18:54
Actually a good point i haven't given much thought.
The inflation problems already are rising in many different countries right now.
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:11:33


So that's why eventually all fiats always fail. So it is time for something better. Because they always take the short cut sooner or later and they can't resist to take the free money.

@_date: 2018-09-07 14:38:18
No. 
They lost xx bitcoin. At that time it was xx in fiat money. They recovered bitcoins and put those into the "treasure" for the lawsuit.
Then bitcoin rose a lot so that the value of those bitcoins which are left in this year prices are higher than the actual total debt outstanding. So they sold bitcoin, paid all the outstanding debt and left still with bitcoins in the bankrupt treasure.

Walking into a bank. Asking for a 200k mortgage, needing to provide two good salaries for this 30 year mortgage.
The bank thinks i can pay the interest so they walk to the computer, they add 200k to my name and i (we) can pay interest for the next 30 year on money they just created on the spot, that is slavery. Most funny thing of all, that bank was involved in the libor fraud, so at least my money will be used for something good :)

Sorry to break your hopes man, but they aren't coming in just yet. They start to try to make a great profit from them by selling paper bitcoins to everyone who want to buy now.

I dunno man, in the end its better to buy American business than some vague crypto token which really does nothing.
Bitcoin offers something which Warren Buffett not need and is not specialized in. That man buys stocks (parts or whole businesses) and is the best ever.
I think you think those rich people are making a conspiracy against young people or something i have to disapoint you. It isn't, they probably just advise you not to buy crypto as it is not as valuable as people thought it was in January. I have seen it a lot and i am also such "BTC holder" which warned people not to put money into altcoin. But of course they wouldn't listen.
@_date: 2018-09-10 10:04:40
I think he is trying to say that.
" Investor shorts Bitcoin at 7K, borrowing a certain amount of Bitcoin at 7K - Bitcoin then goes to 6,500 and the short seller cashes out."
Buying bitcoin with borrowed money. Wait till it goes to 6.5k and sell back those bitcoin and "cash out" / keep the profit no?

@_date: 2018-09-08 10:31:38
Partly true. But basically the whole housing market is ruined. They use it as a vehicle to get people into debt. If it wasn't so easy to get so much money from a mortgage houses wouldn't be prized so damm high. 
Before people were chained to work and be physically enslaved. Nowadays people are "free" but chained by finance. They need to work 40 hours a week to be able to pay all the bills and keep doing that till almost forever. And they don't even realized they are hooked. Economic slavery is not that pretty.

Yes that is exactly how i see it too. I'm also surprised by people in this space who really has no clue about what is going on actually.

Bitcoin has been on the rise the last years if you didn't notice.
@_date: 2018-09-08 12:34:04
Who says i'm not though? Not really a precious metal kind of person.. Got some silver coins but its more for fun and don't really feel all that special to got some. Maybe will buy like an emergency gold coin. But really don't think much of the portfolio should be in those anymore (at least if you live in kind of stable western country).
I did dump all my bonds earlier this year, took already a hit and with current interest rates and to be honest i don't really like those governments anymore so i decided to dump that shit.
For stocks i haven't decided yet, to be honest i think the bull market isn't over yet, its highly priced but not extreme (taking into account low interest). Maybe i will sell a bit back to fiat.
@_date: 2018-09-09 19:38:38
That is volatile. 
Saving money isn't okay as in most cases they lost money. What is okay about that? At the moment i lose 3.2% per year by saving, and that is calculated with "official inflation". Whats good about it?
If Italy stops paying their way to high debt i lose my savings, very good idea! Meanwhile banks keep giving my money away to other parties and creating inflation which is bad for my own money.. Nice trick once again..
Its just another asset, if you find it to speculative or volatile only invest a small part of your portfolio in it (like 1%). It makes your portfolio not more risky and you gain a better spread.
@_date: 2018-09-14 16:54:45

@_date: 2018-09-28 12:52:25
How much it takes bitcoin to go from 100B to 200B, not 100B for sure. Maybe 10B, so were does this 90B come from? No where of course.. No one lost that 90B.
@_date: 2018-09-01 21:00:13
Why look at it at all? I just wait for the 1 bitcoin 1 lambo conversion.
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:52:45
Yea, it might be higher but not really due to the halving i suppose.
The supply from mining isn't really that big by then. Most coins already are mined today, so the market supply is in control.
I calculated it here not long ago, it is something like half of a day of market trading which is the total mining supply for a full year. So the supply change doesn't really make a dent in total traded coins daily.
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:02:27
Just a normal day, lol.
@_date: 2018-09-23 13:44:10
Already higher highs than in December!

The best thing is to have a car (or other transport option) which can get you reliably and cheaply anywhere you want to go.
Don't buy a car to impress someone, but to use it in a cost effective manner. I prefer my bike and some public transport (but i don't have to get away often).
@_date: 2018-09-26 18:18:14


How is that for a response?
Europe not as SEPA is not instant. US America i highly doubt has a direct system. So where? Or do you maybe just think/pretend it is instant settlement?

Nice, yea that's right. I need to give it more taught next time )
@_date: 2018-09-15 11:04:37
It's because of the way a bank wires the money.
I can send a SEPA EUR transaction, in 3 hours on weekdays it is credited to CB. After that i can purchase bitcoin and send it out directly.

Only in China haha.
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:19:46
Yes correct.
A couple of weeks i did a transcation from Norway to the EU. They charged me 300 NOK (around 35$), it was for a low transaction and ended up being around 35% commission.. I had to email them many times too, it reminded me on why we need this better system and get rid of banks as soon as possible.
@_date: 2018-09-22 09:04:29
That's not how markets work, you just look for a confirmation.
If you look long and hard enough you think you see it everywhere.
And for sure whales don't move the market like that, it really makes zero sense. Just visit reddit for a while and see when the price is low confidence is low. When the price shoots higher confidence rices. We the people move the market, not some kind of whale in moms basement somewhere.
@_date: 2018-09-27 07:20:44
Yea nice saying :)
@_date: 2018-09-10 07:54:34
Yes me too.. It feels kind of they are stealing. But i tried to convince them that it is not normal but they don't assist. I think i can't really do anything.
They didn't inform about the fee either, they just took it and the girl who arranged it also didn't understand or could explain it (but i guess that is normal for people who work in banks haha).
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:53:20
Yes but she also came from a country with a terrible government, a weak currency and high inflation rates. Aah and i think its even hard to transfer money in and out her country.
Still she didn't really gets the use case :(
I'm thinking about letting her read "The bitcoin standard".
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:56:01
Your numbers seems off. The one mcap doesn't really correspond with the mined quantity. I do think the market is around 8T as far as i remember.
But yes if the price variates 1usd per gram all the gold in grams will vary in that price.
Mind you that there is also a 80 to 1 paper gold market. So for every 80 people who think they own gold actually only 1 person really holds the gold.
@_date: 2018-09-07 18:38:31

@_date: 2018-09-22 16:02:43
What holds you back from mining? 
They don't control bitcoin and there are more players then bitmain. It looks more like Bitmain is digging its grave so they seem not so powerful.
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:40:36
Funny thing is that people will find their way when things starts to collapse.
No marketing needed for that. And it will build more trust in the system, which in return makes the system better. Great design isn't it?, a design based on trust and no one gets off worse, who on earth ever imagined that could happen!
@_date: 2018-09-22 23:06:43
I don't own any bcash so i don't really concern about it.
Bitcoin itself it doesn't really mater as there is not one miner controlling everything. Even a pool of miners has no majority. And even if they have a majority, why on earth they would invest all that money to hurt there own investment.
@_date: 2018-09-23 10:24:02
Most likely bitcoin will crash firstly like almost everything else. Then it can start to rise slowly and people might start to see it as a real save heaven. From there on it can go quickly, but who knows.

@_date: 2018-09-03 17:46:10
True, i think there is also just something about bitcoin. Don't know really what but something.
I try to explain. First i got known to bitcoin it was pretty new. At the time i understood that banking was bad, i liked the tech. I even played around with it. Calculated about mining etc. But i decided somehow to not really do anything with it.
Then there was a big parabolic rise, i got (because of the price) again interested and started to read even more. But i still didn't get in (i bought like 20usd to try)! Only in the beginning of last year it started to read once again and became really hooked to it.
So it took pretty long and was pretty surprised about December last year, but to be honest i really think 2018 is just the beginning. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 08:11:11
Yea indeed, we never know haha.

@_date: 2018-09-28 08:35:39
Nothing is totally hack-proof. As some humans invent something and others try to brake it. But the odds are rather small at the moment that this will happen anytime soon. And by the time it might be coming easier we can make it harder of course. If you really trust it is up to you in the end, you can check things for yourself that is a huge plus. But in the end you trust on all kinds of applications in daily live without putting much thought to it.
You could buy just a few dollars at an exchange and send it to a wallet like Electrum. So buy worth a few bucks, install the wallet, send it over. Just play with it a bit, then you get a better understanding!
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:29:54

Not really the same though. 
Internet gave me information and knowledge my government or i in no other way would ever possessed.
The governments now start to cut down on this free information and use it as a tool to abuse your privacy in ways we haven't seen ever before. Same way as how they turned a barter system into a full controlled government (or in America's case a company) operation which all the power they want.

So it is logical that your net worth changes.
It does every day 24/7.
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:52:31
Thats when people stop really using a real number.
People just get paid and dump there money into groceries right away (sometimes like in weimar, Germany even twice a day!). The number doesn't really matter anymore, you just work and buy something (to feed yourself/family).
Things like gold, stock, (maybe bitcoin), will skyrocket.
Also often when inflation gets high normally as it happens in smaller countries they just start using Euro or USD. Firstly for saving and in real worst scenarios also for paying daily stuff.
If one of those big currencies collapse it will be madness, the whole world would be in big trouble (as major currencies/economies are very interconnected, even directly with IMF etc).
Oh also barter becomes more practicable. Basically the trade becomes much more slowly and less efficient. As a currency can arrange near zero cost for exchanging with each other. With barter and trading for hard assets the price is harder to set, so there is wide margins and everything slows down.
@_date: 2018-09-17 16:16:46
That is even only half the rate they printed before and they have been doing it for years now.
Just some out of the box idea, not really reality. But after all as 1 billion a day seems a lot in the grant scheme of things it isn't all that many.

Although i really like bitcoin there is a chance that it fails. Than your reward will be close to zero. So like as in all assets/deals there is risk involved.
That's why you talk about lucrative ROI, to get a possibility of good return their is a fair amount risk involved too.

@_date: 2018-09-04 10:30:16
China is a hypocrisy.
They are also limit (or before i guess not even allowed) in holding foreign currencies. They want to limit the exchange from yuan to other fiats so they can maximize their own profits.
Yes there are many Chinese owning everything across the globe.
I think i read in one of Jim Rogers books about exchanging dollars in a local bank in China. But the exchange rate out of the street (just in front of the bank) was much better as locals exchanged in that way to foreign currencies.
If people want something bad enough no government can stop them.

Look how people get rich man. You think Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos hold their estimated wealth in cash?
They all hold houses, paintings, precious metals, land, bonds, investment accounts, foreign currencies. In general their net worth exceeds the inflation rate and a wealthy gained more in a year from the assets than those who work 40 hours.
 
And i would rather loose 20k of 1 million than 200 on 10000. Because that last option hurt way more.

So in what you should have diversified so sell your bitcoin to what?
@_date: 2018-09-07 15:07:09
Exactly my point. That is diversification.
Not putting money in 20 shitcoins because bitcoin grew very much. Its just speculation and they falsely believed that diversifying made it less risky.

The beauty of the EU is that you can easily move to a more tax friendly country :)
@_date: 2018-09-08 09:44:55
Simple ask yourself those questions:
Do you want to store money into a computer system from some vague company where government controls the outcome of the success of that "money". They surely "slowly" and at a steady pace inflate away your money. At the mean time they use it for all kind of unhuman things. And last but not least if they don't like you anymore they can just take it all. (Or they need to take all of your money to keep the bank up and running as they over speculated again).
Or do you want to keep money into a decentralized ledger, secured with the higgest computer power, no one bad party who has or can take full control, a predictable and decreasing inflation, pseudonymity and if you don't like your country anymore you could take your 12 words and find a better home for your money.
@_date: 2018-09-18 10:13:08
At least!! Oh wait another empty prediction. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:58:10
Yes it was really good! Also met some cool locals so it was nice :)
Maybe the best approach is then to search how you can make it legal, find some lawyer who would want to help and see how things can be done? 
Indeed if it is all vague and there is not any rules and it might be illegal you need to find out that first, maybe you can find some loophole in your country. But i doubt that the government will be supportive by itself. Although it can be good for business, so who knows?
Here it is not really illegal to use it for commerce and for investment for sure it is not illegal as they even ask for your bitcoin holdings in my yearly tax report. I think not many countries have it as legal tender, but that doesn't really make it directly illegal.
Maybe even create some sort of think tank kind of group which gator information and together with businesses/investors present something to the government? Some countries like Malta and Swiss really take a positive approach (as they can/are profiting from it).
@_date: 2018-09-27 09:33:12
Yes it just randomly jumps up and down lol.
You think an Alexa rank change makes the price go up or down?
In long term perspective you can talk about fundamentals, but even an Apple or Google stock in short term just moves randomly.
@_date: 2018-09-06 08:08:17
It's not manipulators though. Search for a random market patern and throw it over bitcoin. It would be pretty perfect in line.
In the first rounds people still had hope (so the price shoots up to $9k). Now i see less and less enthausasim and more people screaming its all "manipulation". So the market buying power becomes less strong and so the lows get lower and the highs get lower.

Roads in France are often privatized, many of the main highway roads are toll roads from private companies.
They cost a lot but are indeed very good taken care off. Often indeed a government can't give the same service for the same of less money. Steve jobs ones said this about public schools too, and i start to see how his vision was correct.

I'm pretty sure that in many countries the license for operating an exchange and lending customers is very different, so they also need to hide it from their government.
Risk everything as in if something goes wrong, the government will punish them, an employee will talk or whatever. They can lose all their reputation. A pretty stupid move imo if you have a good profit machine going on.

I'm talking about bankers as in people who work in real physical banks or bank-like companies. 
It is funny because this and many other cases in this space have at least been tried hard to be compensated. 
While the first banker (except from Iceland) still needs to be punished for the pre 2008 problems.
So while banks, governments and other people say bitcoin or crypto is bad/dangerous/whatever, actually it is showing that it is not so bad after all. The real criminals wear blue suits and work in big well known offices.

Yes it is called a bank run, that problem exist already for a very long time.
Basically it is even worse than that, as soon as the money supply (the creation of money) start to drop the system already is crashing real fast (hence the reason why they need to print more money).

Euro is way worse then Mark though. 
Yes i remember Lehman, what did change after that? Did bankers go to jail? Did they stop selling bad products? Did they reduce the debt? Did they make any structural changes? What they mainly did was inflating the bubble to an even bigger bubble we have now. In 2007 we had a housing bubble, by now we have an everything bubble. Don't expect to be sure that eur or usd will not fail.
Only Germany is already financing Italy and Spain through 1 trillion short term debt (target2) were no one talks about. The EU is worse than it ever was and a financial crisis would be very bad. Remember that the ECB is still printing money till this day!
The market in northern europe should have higher interest to cool down the bubble but they can't as the whole system is still very in balanced even after a major wealth transfer from north to south.
And why all this? So that politicians have a bigger region to control?
@_date: 2018-09-08 17:25:03
Yes true, but lets keep it simple :)
@_date: 2018-09-23 09:16:53
True, but there are enough people interested in bitcoin. The government isn't really against it. All in all pretty good environment for locals to run a node for fun. There is even a so called "bitcoin city" Arnhem.

@_date: 2018-09-22 13:45:46
It will change the power to the people as before the powerful/rich had control over you.
Like before knowledge was power, those who had access to knowledge had an advantage over the rest. But nowadays even poor people have internet access and with only the access to internet knowledge is abundant. The banking industry hasn't really changed by digital transformation of the world, they kept their monopoly, the government kept the money/banking system the same.
But now things are changing, that's why "power to the people" what is starting to happen is really pretty unique and i am afraid those in power don't let go easily and things will get nasty rather soon.
@_date: 2018-09-02 22:03:30
When everyone is paying with bitcoin it will be very stable (as it is very predictable).
Why people who bought lambo than bought a lambo now? And not kept their bitcoin or bought a house or land?? Ah maybe because they like to enjoy their earned money and enjoy the lambo?

A zero-sum game is for example a poker game were 10 people pay 5$.
The winner takes all so he walks away with $50 why the rest end up with zero.
In your analogy this poker game would have one 1 winner (50$). And 9 losers who lost 50$.
@_date: 2018-09-24 09:48:43
You might save a few pennies on a transaction but you lose full percentages on the price which falls harder. Can't imagine how that really is "cheaper". 
If i really want to do cheap transactions i would use my debit card for free and don't bother with any magic internet money.

I had the same idea lol.
@_date: 2018-09-07 23:30:39
I would start with buying some small piece of bitcoin. You can buy even just 5$ or less. Just play with it at first and see what it is/does. Don't start buying other shitcoins because they are cheap neither.
Don't start with mining, if you don't live somewhere where the price of Electricity is almost free it would be impossible to make a buck out of it.

I don't know where you live, but if you are targeted to be kidnapped for $30k i would consider moving instead of getting into bitcoin.
All around the world you find assets worth a multiple more than your bitcoin holdings, why you are so worried?
@_date: 2018-09-25 08:20:50
Yes true, but at the moment everything is out of wack. Central banks, banks and governments who need to control them.
You need to see bitcoin not (yet) as such system about borrowing and everything. Firstly there is a need for a hard currency.
Let say you lived in such period and you could choose between a gold (backed) currency and a fiat currency, would you have gotten a mortgage in gold? It's always the best practice to get a mortgage in a weak currency, i bet you can get a 0% mortgage in Swiss Francs right now. So great no? No interest at all! I know even some people who has a negative mortgage. But the problem is the exchange rate of course.
Same for bitcoin, as long as there is fiat currencies you need not to lent in bitcoin. Probably it will never be an economy with only bitcoin and if it will we find our way to get everything going anyway.

@_date: 2018-09-25 15:15:28
I think they haven't been bailed out? 
It is not really an insurance either, its common practice those days that "your" money until a certain amount is "guaranteed". Its 100k€ in my country and i think 80k pound in England.
It is basically just some empty words to make the bank system not fail directly. But most likely you will get at least that money back in case shit hits the fan. Not really to rely on but you need something.
Don't forget don't put more money into any bank account then you are willing to lose!

@_date: 2018-09-26 11:46:58
Don't stop asking questions and find information online/youtube. It's okay to be a noob and just find out everything along the way :)
Its not good or bad to sad a low amount. Just if you make a mistake like i did and many others you lost only 5$. A mistake is made easily, so its better to just try with "play money" first before you start sending whole bitcoins or more :p
It definitely is better than a penny stock. Really recommending to read the book "the bitcoin standard" to get a better picture of bitcoin.
In the end its up to you to decide how much you can invest in it. An x percentage of your net worth, a % of your monthly salary many things are possible but you find that out yourself which you feel comfortable with. But just try firstly with something small and see what it is/does!

Tangible doesn't mean shit in the current time we live in.
@_date: 2018-09-28 16:54:48
But it isn't a real insurance, so the money needs to come from somewhere anyway, hence the bail out.
Yes that bonus money and how those companies performed in general is stupid and we shouldn't have "fixed" it in that way.
Anyway next time it will be bail-ins lets see how that goes :)
@_date: 2018-09-14 12:26:18
Cost more as in a higher price?
You do understand the difference between price and value?
Is silver worst than gold in your mind?
The price doesn't really matter as you can divided as you like no?
For instance my country accepts only 0.05, my bank accepts 0.01 and my bitcoin adress accepts 0.00000001.
Bitcoin takes the time to move as it is setup that way. It is never setup the way to be the most fast, it is about security. Last time i send XRP it took like a second, but it isn't better than bitcoin.
If you want you can send a LN transaction in seconds and it keeps the security from the bitcoin blockchain. So if you are really looking for fast transactions go ahead, it is already working.
I think about the fee there was lately a calculation on how much the fee in bitcoin really cost per total input and it came out that bitcoin is more efficient in sending transactions for lower cost, but i'm not really into that so someone else might know more about that stuff.

@_date: 2018-09-07 11:45:05
Yes they did.
I think they were allowed to keep all those bitcoin. As Japanese law describe to pay back all debtors in fiat at the time it happened. So they had more bitcoin left than there was debt. Which MtGox could keep but decided to give out to the real owners.
At least this is what i understood out of it.

So bitcoin can never be in a bear market? As it goes up and down but in general up (like everything else in the world).
A +70% downturn is just a little bounce.
Everyone is still positive and no one in shorting right? And what is 9 months on a lifetime after all.

Yes true. I think also every hype/crash the coins get more spread and more new people got in (maybe at the wrong time in short term but if they stay it isn't all that bad in the end).
At around 100k a bitcoin things get really serious and suddenly investors really start to want it.

There are a lot of legal leverage exchanges out there.
It's volatile because it is a highly speculative market.

Lets wait for a big bank to fail, that would be a cool time to use bitcoin as a showcase.

Yes so mining cost has no influence on price. As the output stays always the same. It only makes miners go out of business if the price is too high.
If i start mining bitcoin i will lose a small fortune, yet the bitcoin market doesn't care if i mine or not.
Miners have zero price influence.

I don't agree with this. As that means the world wouldn't grow. That someones gain is always someone else's loss. But than the world would never have come so far as it has come today.
Lets take bitcoin. Satoshi literally just created bitcoin out of thin air. At the beginning there was nothing, now there is something. Both financially and non financially bitcoin brought us something. In the last 10 years if we make up the sum does that amount equal back to zero? I doubt it very much and i wouldn't be interested in it if it did so.
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:59:27
Can relate to this. Did many LN transactions and $1 is an overstatement. Also have routed many transactions for free or for 1 Satoshi or something like that. It works pretty neat.

Stocks? Stocks isn't bitcoin.
If i was you i wouldn't probably buy anything except some books to start reading and then make some decisions.
Companies stocks (shares) can be a very good asset to buy but you gotta know what you are doing. Not listen to some financial guy and neither ask the real basics on Reddit. Try to gather some knowledge before you waste all your money on your first lesson.

I know how bad the system is, but when a crisis arise everyone and everything will flow into usd/eur. It's just how things work, later bitcoin might rise indeed as it just keeps working and people can hide in this new asset class. But don't expect directly for that to happen, there needs to be a bailin first and some major banks need to limit it to 50$, then people will think and find bitcoin.

They aren't buying or willing to buy. Why they would acknowledge bitcoin has value?
The moment real trusted parties start to acquire bitcoin the price will go bonkers. They will keep trying to play their fraudulent game for as long as possible. But when the music stops playing it goes quickly.

I wonder now, bail ins are supposed to be after the insured money yes? So xxx is "government insured" normally and all credit after that could/will be used for a bail in.
But those people who have big amount of money could then really start to think serious about the bitcoin for the first time, i think the most people with big amounts of money still don't see bitcoin at this moment as good investment/safe heaven. If a few bail ins occur things can change quickly.

That nothing ever will be in a bear market...
Look at the s&amp;p from the last 100 year. Does '29 now really look like a bear market? It is nothing more than a small dip down.
Really if you think a 70% correction is not a bear market... The sentiment we have been through the last couple of months... Everything is bearish. Of course it can go up when the bull is getting out, but that doesn't change the fact we are bearish right now. From January till now the price only went down down down.

@_date: 2018-09-09 11:30:06


What is good about it?
Let say the frac ratio is 3%.
Let say you have 3k$ savings
Your mortgage is 100k$
So basically you pay interest over 100k (let say 4%), so $4000 in interest while the bank created that loan out of your saving account and pays you 0.05% interest over 3k =  $1.5
So as the bank is the only one who licensed to create such money for you they have a margin of 2666%. Seems legit right? What they actually produced? What is their economic value besides letting others slave away for many years to pay back those loans?
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:00:15

It is named for the way in which a bear attacks its prey — swiping its paws downward. This is why markets with falling stock prices are called bear markets. Just like the bear market, the bull market is named after the way in which the bull attacks by thrusting its horns up into the air. 
We keep making lower highs for 9 months about 10% of bitcoins lifetime, but sure bud it is still a bull market because it started at less than a dollar.

You don't know yet if that money will flow into bitcoin.
Money which flows in gold hardly ever touched any bitcoin. We might have that confidence but an average investor is still very anxious about bitcoin (that's why an ETF might bring some real trust to the table, if they only use full funded physical ETFS at least).
Actually i just checked and gold fell firstly 26% in 2008 before it started a bull market. In a crisis fiat (usd/eur) is still king.

True, but i'm not wanting to fully bet on it, as ideas might change.
I was really surprised how the world recovered after the 2008 crisis, how they really successfully did this. But the problem is they didn't really resolve any real problem. With more debt into the system the system itself becomes weaker and weaker. They play a dangerous game and in the next crisis there is an alternative which wasn't there before. 
I wouldn't sleep comfortable as a central banker if i knew i needed to print a new set of trillions while people might run off to this crazy thing called "bitcoin".

@_date: 2018-09-26 16:55:49


No. It doesn't matter. If you send money now by bank transfers it takes 1 day at least for settlement. And they work only on week days. Did i mention they don't work on bank holidays either? Yet trillions of commerce are going through it on a daily base and it wouldn't be a problem. (Actually in europe they are even "borrowing" through this short term system, Spain and Italy are short 1 trillion euro and NL, DE , FI and LU are sponsoring those countries, with the Target2 system).
I'm pretty sure if i order something online the settlement takes place after i already got delivered the package. Can you see how awful old that system is? Yet it works both for me and the seller as we do trust it. Same will be for bitcoin and the payment systems.
@_date: 2018-09-19 08:53:28

I hope bitcoin can/will really make the world a better place. It is extreme sick how the world of finance worked and actually the same shit is still going on exactly in the same way with the same people at the steering wheel. And soon they will again need tax money and blame anything but themselves while poor hardworking people become again and even more victims of those people.
@_date: 2018-09-17 09:01:33
Yea true. I don't know it was very likely they do such things. Even online broker accounts have some strange rules which seems to be allowed. Weird stuff it is.

The fees at those ATM's might be high (but for sure not 50% at $50).
If you still know the adress you can fill it here:
You might find back the transaction. Check back what the exchange rate was when you send the bitcoin and how much he actually got.
My best guess is that he should have received at least $40 after all the fees.

Maybe learn where the discussion is about. It was about going in at once when the opportunity arises vs DCA. Besides enough people have proven that diversification is BS when you know what you are doing.  Anyway that's not even the discussion here.

@_date: 2018-09-22 12:20:37
Its pretty unique that something is in a bubble and at the same time very useful and disruptive. The technology is slowly improving indeed and the need for it is ever increasing.
I think it is part of the adoption phase, every "bubble" new people get attracted and the total bitcoins spread wider and in smaller amounts. Before people got hold on hunderds of bitcoin and traded them around. Now people trade/buy in the 0.1-1 range and people are happy to reach a whole bitcoin. Eventually it is likely that even that becomes a big amount. It will be really interesting to see how slowly the (wealthy) investors starts to take bitcoin in their portfolio and it could be the ultimate hedge.
@_date: 2018-09-27 12:05:30
So then keep your bitcoin safely in a storage far away from any exchange!

Luckily France isn't financing those countries through the Target2 system. Like some other eu countries are:
Or search on duckduckgo: "target2 balances"
Its absurd in how many ways southern EU is getting money while North is financing everything and the interest rates are totally fcked up (which basically is another way to transfer money). It's a big wealth transaction to make their dream about an one big Europe a reality...

Where you see that something is leaving the market?!
@_date: 2018-08-03 09:33:53
You can not compare the price of A to B without taking into account the total underlying supply.
Bitcoin has maximum 21 million coins. So at this moment: 21 million * $ 7.400 = $155.400 million would be the total for now.
While USD is $1 but the supply is unlimited. The US can decide to print 1 trillion usd out of nothing (1 trillion dollar = 1.000.000 million $).
Money supply of US, although it is very hard to estimate this. Lets look at the number Money Supply M2. I found this number: $ 14.112.000 Million as of June 2018. I hope you understand it a bit, otherwise just ask. There are many more USD actually than there is usd woth of bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-09-01 18:01:49
Basically the new "banks" (crypto exchanges), could already operate under fractional reserve. 
New products are already trying to be introduces (ETFs who doesn't hold any bitcoin directly), its basically coinage dilution (at least for the people who are fools enough to buy those ETFs).
If you create bitcoin debt IOU, you basically create also extra bitcoins (like in the current financial system).
I'm not totally convinced that you know that fiat for the biggest part is just numbers in a computer, not even fake paper or coins..  With bad intentions your brain is the only limit to which you can apply all kind of schemes, under almost any circumstance.
Just remember, when you own the seed of your bitcoin, you and only you can have full access to those bitcoins.

Well not all but many bitcoin investors invested money into it not really for maximum gains in three months but to be free from banks/fiat currencies it is like an insurance policy against that and your government.
The people who lost money can hold their bitcoin and learn more about it, they could lower the purchasing price if they now buy it while its on a 70% discount.

You would have been making a killing if you dollar cost averaged since 2010. Bitcoin isn't going away.

@_date: 2018-08-01 10:33:06
Actually bitcoin is worth more than a USD. The fact that you can control it yourself and send money around the world for almost zero fees makes it having a real purpose which can and will be used for a long time. When the fate in USD is gone the currency is worthless like many fiats has shown in the past.
I'm not saying bitcoin is worth 7k, it just has some real value in it.

I live in a well civilized country and work sometimes for automation/robot companies. Those improvements go really fast. Take into account other (online) improvements, things like self driving cars etc. AI systems which start to be introduced.
In all those sectors the output went up many times while wages are mostly stagnant for the last 30 years. If you can't gasp the idea, okay, but don't think its not here/coming.  Banking sector is next in line for loosing many jobs (although they laid off many people in the last decade, there are still much more to be left on the street).
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:42:25
One would have the hardest time in doing a fundamental valuation on a business with real assets, real cashflow real earnings. An account who checks the books. And even than, a margin of safety of around 34% would be advised, as it is hard to come up with the correct figure and you might be just wrong.
But than we have a hyper volatile new asset class which trades uncontrolled around the whole world. With many different views and interests. But this guy can put a valuation on it and even precisely at 8k at talking about a "margin of safety" when the current price is only just 20% below his estimate.
So yea i think a simple BS would do the job. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:04:41

As a sole entrepreneur in the EU i had this option already since 2016.
@_date: 2018-08-03 10:52:18
They can and probably already are. Than they will show how 1 crypto USD will always be one dollar and is a better option than bitcoin. But i'm not sure people really would start to use it.
At the moment a group of (European) big banks is making their own coin i think.
But they (banks, governments, cbs) failed to understand that people are not stupid, they think they just can keep up their ponzi schemes and keep everyone in the dark. The main adoption will be driven not because it is cool or better but because it becomes a necessity.
Think about Iran, Venezuela or even China is a smaller case. Those people are hurt far more than most other people in the world by using the local currency. They have no choice but to use other systems which are not owned by the same people who harmed them. 
My best guess is that the adoption will be driven by poorer countries and from there start to spread to more and more countries. Actually that is part of the success of the USD imo, in many poor countries the USD is used as more stable currency they can and will switch someday. Maybe bitcoin will become much more popular in the west when a financial crisis hits us again (but it is hard to say at this point).

No it's not. New jobs are not coming fast enough to replace old jobs. Also wages decline so that's why unemployment rates are not getting super high.

Buy a little bit to see just how it works (it does't have to be more than you spent on a normal meal). Just play around with it and you will get to know it better (and there is not much you can lose).
The price is a difficult question as there are people who say it goes to zero and many who say it goes to xx.000, so what i might advice you is to read into Dollar cost Average. That means that you don't buy it at one price but regularly over a longer period so you get an average price (which is not the lowest and not the highest).
The bitcoin Standard is a good book i think you will get some more knowledge from!

They both not will go for it soon indeed. But there will come a time when a poorer government which always was under the pressure of the west will dump their USD/EUR currency holdings and go for bitcoin. No doubt that this will happen, many realize of course that this system is bad. Until now there just haven't been an alternative.
Look for example how China, India and Russia are hoarding gold and dumping fiats. But gold can/is also in the hands of the west.

There is something called the Pareto principle. Wealth isn't in equal hands. Not by communist, not by capitalist. Even if we give everyone on the earth now 10$ and see the system in 1 to 5 years mostly the same people will end up with the same wealth as of today.
Sorry man, bitcoin can't change that. Not sure about the monopoly though. Monopoly the game or a monopoly in business is that you can have an advantage above other players. I don't really see the advantage of a person having 1 bitcoin or 1 million bitcoin.

That doesn't have to happen at all. Do you think when i make a purchase in another country that provider has a currency risk with me? Of course not. I purchase in the local value and a bank converts it to my currency with MA exchange rates.
Now for bitcoin there are also such solutions. So let say Amazon wants usd (or any other shit fiat coin). So they just price item X with 100$. You pay in bitcoin at an agreed range (automatic by payment provider). So you pay xx btc and Amazon receives 100$ - a fee. A fee which can be compatative with a creditcard, only now the payment is 100% sure to come. Unlike with creditcards.

I read somewhere that btc transactions in that kind of way were below 10%. I have no idea if that's true or not. But my best guess is that bitcoin isn't used that much for illegal transactions. Its what bitcoin haters would like to say so though.

No fee's are tempting. But without good liquidity it doesn't really help. There are enough DEX available who can offer a good platform with low fees. But without huge usage it becomes pretty useless for exchanging. So you really need to resolve the liquidity issue.

I like the idea of gold. But in reality i think nowadays its not really that "special" anymore. Maybe for extreme risk insurance it is kind of neat.

Funny how you come here to insult bitcoiners while most bitcoiners in fact are the opposite of your insult. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:52:34
Yes that is true.
But i think many in this space are young and have few experience with investing in general, so it might not always be the best advice. I see many alt investors who have no clue about the risks (yes about that they "might" lose all, but they don't get how big the chances are that it really become a reality) They thing mostly about the "potential".
@_date: 2018-08-25 21:47:37
It's okay to be cheap, but don't be cheap on investing for your future. If you invest well diversified and with good logic it will be a good basis for your future!
I think the best thing you can do is learn more about what is bitcoin, why we need it?, what can it do for you. Not only in bitcoin but also in regular investments (stock, indexes, big funds etc).  In investing you will not win every dime, you need to deal with risks and losses (sorry, its just what it is). 
Probably the best thing to do is learn more about bitcoin, watch some videos (andreas antonopoulos on youtube for example). Learn more about investing, throw in some money you can miss and start to understand how all things work.
@_date: 2018-08-22 11:09:03
Yea ofc. Maybe they will even bribe Satoshi to get his coins.
@_date: 2018-08-25 12:38:33
It depends on you.
Do you want to get known by exchanges/government? Than probably coinbase or other big exchanges are the best (most safe) and cheapest option.
You can use localbitcoin but be warned. There are many scammers and it did go wrong multiple times in the past. But it is also used often so read more about it.  Don't get scammed nor robbed while making the transaction..
A guy not long ago sold 2 bitcoin for about 20k. He ended up with 20k fake bills by using localbitcoins.

@_date: 2018-08-06 11:01:37
Sorry i didn't understand. Not sure that is possible anymore. They didn't stop backing it the last time for no reason. Governments like the idea that they can print their problems away. This debt-fiat system has to continue until it explodes. Personally i think there is no way back or any changes are possible. They just hope somehow that again more debt/ quantitative easing will resolve the problem in the next crisis. (Actually i think it might even work as long as the majority of the people keep accepting the bs fiat scheme, but not sure how long that will last).

20k Would not crash the market.
You could go to Coinbase and set a sell order at 13.5k (if the price is 14k). It will maybe eat up the order book and trigger arbitrage to fill your order in no time.

yes, you will see more booms and busts in the future. Every time the price will rises and becoming more wide spread. In the real far future it will become really stable, much more than gold ever was. As bitcoin has very predictable economics and its easily worldwide accepted but not easily influenced by anyone.

At this rate they can't even keep up with the dumping rate from the miners...
@_date: 2018-08-25 14:32:17
I agree with you. But many projects are there, if they raised money and cashed it out for fiat they have a bank to build something with. So they could survive a while, while bitcoin goes up. People can't really wait and want bigger gain, so they will go in search for the bigger gains in alt coin, as they already delivered in the past too.
I'm not really liking that idea or so, i think alts are pretty bad company wise and financially. But i just have to agree with the fact how illogical and greedy humans are. This vision i got about this changed after being a long time on a forum with many alt holders. They don't understand what bitcoin truly is but they all get in the hype off every shitcoin with just many promises. When bitcoin booms i just by now have no doubt that they will once again throw in salaries and savings in their beloved alts.

True, especially just for ultimate safety (just one coin or sth). But for me it also shows that gold becomes less convenient than bitcoin. I would rather own 1 bitcoin than 5.5 ounce of gold. Lets not even think about the risk/reward. Lets hypothetically think they are the same, bitcoin really seems more attractive to me.
@_date: 2018-08-10 09:53:39
Yes some will be early. The risk takers, others will be later and feel comfortable when paying a much higher price. In the end the funds who don't get in on time will be blamed why they didn't allocate money into bitcoin and will find them self in a capital outflow.

Not true.
Even if we keep using fiat as a barter system but take our savings out of fiat and into bitcoin, bitcoin will become way more valuable. Yes you could and should spent bitcoin as it has its advantages and it should you cost almost nothing extra as fees are low and you can buy back at anytime what you have spent.
But there is nothing wrong with just buying bitcoin and holding them. If people do that it shows they trust their money with bitcoin and this gives bitcoin value too.
@_date: 2018-08-18 11:19:46

BTC dominance is not really a good measure. As most alt coins have a very illiquid order book. Let say you need to buy 20k bitcoin to move the price $200. While with 20k$ you can move an alt coin very easily 10-20-30%. There is no one really trading those coins.
So in very small quantities the price moves up and down widely.  But if people really want to cash out those coins it crashes to zero easily. (That's a reason for example that bitmain dumped bitcoin and not their 1 mil bcash, as their is no way they can even sell like 20% of their bags. The price would have dropped to zero).
@_date: 2018-08-31 08:56:33

Dollar cost average would be the best i think.  I dunno you need to make your own decision based on what you think or feel comfortable with. Don't procrastinate about this though. I did exactly that with the though "i will really check that out later, later, later". That ended up costing me more (missed opportunity rewards) than i could even loose with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:25:40
Pretty impressive how they pulled that off last time, didn't expect it to work so well.
But it costed the world deeply. In Europe the bond market is still a mess. So 10 years later they are still fixing the last crisis...
Next one will be not so easy to fix as the 2007 problems weren't solved but they just put a band aid on it and hoped that that would stop the bleeding.

@_date: 2018-08-11 12:49:13
Because alts drove on the hype of bitcoin. Everyone started to see the rise of bitcoin and instead of making the infrastruce of bitcoin better they just wanted to gain themselves too. So they copy shit and come up with crazy stories/ideas and market it as the next bitcoin or whatever.
Now you see all hope just getting out of the price slowly.
Bitcoin is the market, alts just try to keep up as there main orderbook is in btc. In the end most (almost all) will fail to do that.
@_date: 2018-08-07 12:42:09
If a company issues stock/cash dividend and you decide to take cash dividend you end up with less.
If they raise more capital and you don't chip in you just got deluded.
If a company issues stocks to purchase another company you got less.
There are many ways.
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:53:12
Yes true. It's like Dollar cost averaging. It works good if you have a strategy in any investment. If you trust in a project and invested in it because you understand it, it shouldn't worry you that the prices goes up or down.
I have been buying on the way down and i know its not the best strategy to buy something which falls hard, but i just wanted to secure some coin and i know that that would cost me. But now at lower prices i only feel more comfortable to buy more. Just always keep a cash cushion around so you are still able to pay for bills/ uncertainties etc. And it can get you a great bargain in some cases when markets move strangely.

As there is no way that the whole world will follow this view. So like BitTorrent, it might be illegal in many countries, the system works pretty well around the whole world regardless.

For years, hold or get out and watch it sky rocket one day again.
Also halfening has more impact on bitcoin miners (as there reward get slashed in half\~). The price of mining has no direct impact on the market price. And every halfening would the effect be less as there is less supply to half. Most coins are already mined by now so the market price is based on the biggest float, the couple percentage which get added those days have less and less impact.
@_date: 2018-08-06 16:47:31

Sooner rather than later you are on the wrong side of the bet and you will loose most/all. Good luck with that. No i don't want to be richer in the fiat world. I don't want to become poorer in the fiat world (that's for sure to happen if i hold fiat).

Bitmain has high margins and big net income. Although i would say it is hard to extrapolate those numbers. It might be, if you know the business of mining well and can see that the future earnings of this company are not in danger it is not even valued so extreme high. 
They made 1.1$ Billion in profit in q1 18.

I also want to go back to the time i first came across bitcoin. Boy i liked the idea, but of course i didn't invest in it! LOL. But to be honest that also comforts me. 
Now in the end of 2017-2018 people got known to bitcoin. Many investors for the first time came across it. But like me back in the day they don't invest in it right now. But one day in the future they will have the same Epiphany as i had.

The funny thing is that  beside bitcoin tether is probably on  for usability. It is really used a lot. So of course when there are big movies in the bitcoin market the connected Tether is showing movements too.

The whole point of bitcoin is to load up on some virtual asset when it was trading at 6300, by buying 0.158730158 bitcoin for a grand. Later on you sell to bagholders at 630000000 and you have 1 billion cash on a paltry investment. A bit immoral of course, because you provided no real product or service.

Yes i read. But even without knowing the Amazon market cap you could have figured it out that it is not possible no? 
But they can't sell BCH thats why they sold BTC. Try to sell some BCH on an exchange, there is almost no liquidity. As no one really wants BCH. So dumping 1m coins will bring the price close to zero.

Look at Turkey, Turks don't spent their fiat they escape it. If they would spent the Lira the economy would be booming. And the fiat currency would keep its value.
Fiat is basically based on trust and usability. If one of those two gets tested the fiat is in a problem.

Of course mcap is an important number too. You think if the dollar had a 112b total amount at this moment it would be the worlds reserve currency?

No, why they should? They should just at maximum spent what they can. With inflation people take useless credits for spending now and paying later, that isn't a healthy economy. Look how big the debt problems are around the world.
I will not spent more or less because of inflation/deflation. It's a bullshit argument. Will you eat more potatoes now because next year the price per kg increases by 5%? Will you wait to buy a holiday/iPhone because next year it is cheaper?

It doesn't go up in a straight line. Apple reached a trillion, did you think they went up in one straight line to 1T?
People might not be interested now, but do you think that it stays the same? Can you foresee no problems with fiats or banks in the future? You might never really need the functioning of bitcoin, but i am 100% sure that other people around the world need it. Even today this fact is already shown.
You think when a major financial crisis breaks out and assets get frozen, banks closed, currencies collapse, there is still no need for bitcoin? People might still not be interested? Think again.

Yes it would hurt, but i think some way that's always the case. We can't keep everyone happy and because this space grew so big there is a division to be seen. But i think when attacks start to happen with bigger ammunition the community around bitcoin is and stays strong.?
To be honest i didn't really expected the bitmain KYC change. I'm not sure its from government directly or because of there coming IPO. But for for sure they will try different ways and things we haven't really thought about yet. But i'm sure the genie is out of the bottle and it became way to big to stop this. People who now will be taken away their bitcoin will have severe distrust in the system.

@_date: 2018-08-10 21:29:02
I think there might be a real chance that bitcoin will get adopted in a big way. On one side as a kind of digital gold. Good for storing wealth, hedging the current system, a diversification in any investors portfolio (just a tiny bit will be huge for bitcoin, can you imagine when 1% will be the norm). On the other side i think it will be used in cases like Venezuela or Iran. For them bitcoin can be an ideal tool.
But also just a silent threat against the big central banks/currencies. They now can't really fack up big time as they know than bitcoin will be seen as a real alternative. So its a soft competition for them. If there is a major crisis and banks will fall like they did in 2007 bitcoin will get much bigger in a short time.

@_date: 2018-08-13 15:26:27
Interesting indeed! Best guess that initially bitcoin would go down due to all speculation and margin trading. Some will take out money to cover other problems. After all those loses are settled new fresh money starts to find their way to hide into bitcoin.
It's just my best guess though.

Not really the same though. 
It will crash indeed not even that long from now, between now and a couple of years. Thing is that i think the bankers want to pop up this bubble to the max, look at ECB they are still printing money! We are already almost at the next bust but they need to print as otherwise the southern countries will just collapse. So i think they decided just to make it till the next bubble burst and than find out what to do with the big mass. Italy can't really survive anymore.. It's just on ECB infusion now.

Bitcoin mining is not a business?
You just don't want to agree that bitcoin mining is clearly profitable as the hash rate is showing. 99% of the bitcoin miners do it as their main business. Not because they want crypto anarchy. Yes maybe in their mind, but they run the mining operation still as a normal business.

True, besides just having a strong store of value we need to have many places where you can use bitcoin for payments (or even other applications). Usage and availability will make bitcoin very strong.

They even call it fake bitcoin now which we stole, haha. Damm that people can be that stupid...
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:08:55
I think you look at it from a different angle than most of us. Yes i do hold investments and i know what they can give me. Bitcoin is different than any other investment, you can see it as a hedge against your other investments maybe.
Your investments may seem very safe, but are they really? The central bank tries hard to protect your idea of safe. But it has a cost price by doing so. The world becomes more in debt every year. Once stable currencies are becoming hollow shells while the central bankers keep printing more of it as there is no way to back out of the scheme.
Maybe you need to read to worry less about what it can bring in a returns but more what it brings you in ways no other investment can give you. Real freedom. No one but you in control over YOUR  assets and you can go where you want with it. You don't like your country/regime? Take your 12 words and go somewhere else.
Try to understand what are banks/ fiat currencies / central banks / fractional reserve banking, etc. Learn more about that and you can understand better why there is bitcoin and why it will rise.

If that is true an exchange would be a pretty good coin washer isn't it? If the coins become untraceable on an exchange. Just sign up for an exchange were you don't directly need to verify yourself. Send coins in and out and voila. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 08:31:21
They could try, but they risk the change in people's minds that everyone wants to get in bitcoin instead of in governments fiat. The people have all the power, not the government.
@_date: 2018-08-11 13:56:09
So if it doesn't fail it will grow bigger don't you think? Fiat is all about trust, when trust is lost the fiat currency fails.
Guess who is there lurking in the dark waiting for this to happen? Eventually people will trust this code more than the will trust some bankers/politicians.

I don't know. Have been in crypto for a while and was active on a forum which focused mainly on those altcoin opportunities. But with some knowledge in investing it made me very scared what was happening. If people earn 10-20% per day without understanding what is happening you know something is wrong. And they all saw only how it goes up further and further.
To be honest i still think this was just the beginning of the alt crash. Prices can and will still go much lower imo.

Yes exactly this! Some people even wonder why SN did not made himself public. How many examples we recently had which shows people who were far less dangerous for the system got bitten roughly because of their actions. We need to protect SN from the witch hunt which some feel obligated to.
I think bitcoin will be so revolutionary. Central banks and their debt strategy have put the world in such weird position. Now we got a decentralized system without any big power behind it. No one to corrupt or take illogical benefit from it. I'm scared but also interested to see what the governments will do to stop this. They have fought wars for their fraudulent banking system, so they will not give up easily.

I'm even not sure about couple of millions. It's around 10% of the total supply. It would be pretty hard to acquire so many without setting of a new bull market. Maybe OTC, i have no idea what is going on there. But lets be honest, if you are a big holder from early days, would you sell now? It's mainly the small people who drive the price down (together with shorters) with not super really big quantities.
Yes CB will be very big. But i have no doubt if it will happen, soon someone in a currency war starts doing this. Most likely some CB who got hurt most by western policies. At that moment i think bitcoinisation will start to kick in. Everyone start to want a small piece of it. Than we all start to see how few 21m coins in this kind of financial world really is.

A good lesson to:
A) don't use paypal;
B) don't use to buy/sell bitcoin in this way;
C) to not invest money which you couldn't afford to lose (needed to pay for the bills);
D) think better about your actions/risks.
I know it sucks, but i am not sure what you can do? Maybe you could break the link in paypal with your bank/creditcard. If paypal deducts money from your bank/cc explain them what happened so that they don't pay out the money to paypal (pp wouldn't be happy with this, but fack them).

It will take only a couple of months.
I think then the governments will start to print so much money that they will start buying stocks to prop up the market once again.. Once government sells business to privatize them and spent the money (on what?!?!) and later buy them back with fake money to keep the markets alive. How wonderful.
@_date: 2018-08-29 11:15:34
Everyone is buying high. You just shouldn't sell low (than you shouldn't have bought in the first place).
Today you can buy at 60% discount of the ATH. But it might be still high as your drop can be 100% from today.
Or today's high might be next years low...
No one knows in hindsight what is high and low. Now you would argue that those who sold at 19k are mad geniuses, if the price would have risen to 60k? Not so much... 
@_date: 2018-08-11 10:37:33

I got no clue why you prefer any investment/money maker above food. Are you living with your parents that they provide all your necessities?
I made last week some big purchases while i could buy bitcoin or invest it in the stock market.
Why i didn't? I wanted to have those products, i don't care if i could earn money on that first. You know you live now right? Would you wane be a Warren Buffett with 80 billion on your name and never bought anything or created memories from that money could buy you?

I'm pretty sure for the IRS loss can be deductible too. So look into that if you are at a loss and you could use some tax deductions. (i'm not from USA so i'm not sure but i know people use this deductions by selling stocks, so i think it applies here too).

Now i do understand, thank you.
Although i don't really like Tether at all and do not use it. Tether works pretty good. Look at their daily volume for example. I know many people who went in Tether so i don't think it is all manipulated. But Tether seems a little fishy, but without real data we can't more than make wild guesses.
The market moves often in sharp spikes, this imo a lot to do with the amount of (amature) speculation which is going on in the market. Look for example at the last time shorts went up on:
Look how it went fromm 17k to 30k in the last spike, really at the wrong moment. Such wrong short selling can easily lead to a 5-10% spike in minutes because of automaticly closing those shorts as the price will not easily brake that current support level. It means the system even with short selling is working pretty neat imo.
There is a lot more money needed than a "few million" dollars. If you want to move the price 5-10% i suspect you need closer to (a few) billion dollars. Although not really correct have some look into the market dept (just to get an idea):
Altcoins is were you can easily do this thing. In bitcoin not so much, actually i know that there is a dutch market maker who wants to enter the market. They didn't really have approval of the local SEC, but they wanted to enter anyway. They see huge opportunities to enter this market at a market maker and they will bring billions of dollars to do that.

Yes so they need to rely on a processor, a bank, my good intentions, visa/ma,  etc etc. Not that it doesn't work or not a good way, a extra option is never bad if both the taxidriver and customer like the payment even better!


yes 1 sat/byte, to be sure make it 3 sat/byte - still next to nothing (if you concerned about the fees, start use LN and pay 1-2 Satoshi in fees).


I haven't seen any congestion at the LN did you? If so rates would increase which will seduce new players to run a node, etc etc.


Yes i am from the EU indeed but my country doesn't need any ICO and probably there aren't that many. We are in a booming market so low unemployment, too much money, housing market skyrocket, stock go up etc. Most are not seeking for bitcoin to get a quick buck but get out of fiat to keep their wealth.


Chances are 100% in the future, but we see things differently.  But lets wait till the next collapse, things will get interesting rather quickly.  (CB's will probably enter the market in a late stage at that time bitcoins price is already way higher).


Rich people don't worry about inflation as all their assets will rise. You think rich keep their money in fiat like the average joe does? More and more rich are joining the game slowly, you can see how young this market still is as most rich barely know what bitcoin is. I think in the next crash we will see way more hiding for inflation and hedging in bitcoin. Until now its nothing more than a proof of concept.


That's true, but a discussion can learn us both a thing or two.

Hard to say what will happen in 7 year don't you think? 
At this moment you can let say pay up to 75$ with LN without much of a problem. Transactions higher than that at this moment are anyway more convenient to put on the chain directly. The fees are not that high and so at the moment i think there is a working solution for both low and high payments.
Is 10 minutes really a deal breaker to make a secure payment where you 100% can be sure off? Would you rather take 7k$ in cash or 1 bitcoin for your car and wait 10 minutes? I know which option i would feel more securely with.

What is vague concern about QE?
Take the ECB, they type in some number to "buy" up all the bad debt (Greece/Spain/Italy) and thereby keeping all those countries alive. They don't care if the principal of this debts ever will paid back. It was just some billion typed in a computer on a rainy monday. In this way they keep the interest levels on all the debt at near zero so countries can easily pay their interest and all is well. (LOL!).

Why they should directly approve something on which they most likely have a bare minimum understanding. I find it pretty normal that they take there time until beginning of 2019 and than make a real decision.
Nothing wrong with that. They need to understand the market, how it works, how the ETF would buy/sell bitcoin, all the aspects.
Gold market was already mature at the moment of the ETF. And i got no clue if it got accepted at first either. They made some good points that it might be not good that bitcoin only be bought/sold on Gemini for the Winklevoss ETF.

He needed the 6k the most i suppose. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 10:29:28
There is just a big whale eating all coins below 6k.
And to be honest i don't know what mining has to do with the bear market. If you mine sub 4k and you get new money, why you wouldn't add more supply to the market? Hashrate increase just shows that at those price levels it is still good enough to do business (and make bitcoin stronger while the bear continues)
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:13:49
So find a house seller who would accept bitcoin. As long as you legitimately got your bitcoin it wouldn't be a problem. 
It also makes you wonder once again, is it really your money when they ask questions and do you really want to use such service or even need them?
I would hate it when they would do something like that to my money.

Yes but live just happens. I got known to bitcoin a bit after you &lt;100$. But i just never invested (to be honest i have not even a clue why not). Last year just at around 1000$ i talked with my girlfriend about it a lot and i dove much deeper into bitcoin. But i couldn't really convince my girlfriend (she is not stupid but kind of stubborn). So i thought i convinced myself somehow that i still would not buy it. Long story short i have just been started buying since it is dropping in January. Bought way to high but i just had to punish myself for being so stupid all this time. At today's levels i think it isn't priced all that high anyway, their will be a much higher demand in the coming years and the price will eventually sky rocket.

Just to try it out and see what it is? For sure! First time i bought in dollars the amount is not much more than you are looking at right now. Like 3x your amount. (I did wish very much that i bought more though). The fees might be very high though percentage wise. So read about that a bit.

I know pretty well how banks work. And a custodian who keeps your bitcoin keys is nothing like how most banks operate. Yes of course, now people are used to needing a loan. You think 200 years ago a house was priced at what an average family with two incomes could get for a 30 years mortgage?
Of course if you make the housing market priced so high everyone needs a loan, pretty smart isn't it?
Banks will go away sooner than you think. But don't think so, we all still need phone booths, post offices, retail shops and horse carriages don't we?

Yes i totally agree. 2nd layer will be a big market later i think.

But it's so tiny fraction that it is very important.
You really think 3% inflation really matters that much? Next halving it will be even less..  Look at gold mining they had this 1-4% inflation for many years and it doesn't matter for the total supply.

A "fixed" amount of land? Have you ever imagined how big the earth surface really is? You can even live on the sea also if needed.
It's a human invention that land (property building rights mainly) are scarce. Most nations follow this principal that they keep those rights indeed scare so that the housing market (debt bubble) keeps intact and inflating year after year.

Let say you have one million and like very much the idea of bitcoin. You have read tons about it and knows the ins and outs.

Yes many are misinformed or not truly understanding it. They will someday. It might cost them a lot but that's okay. 
The bitcoin blockchain is here to stay and will help us a lot in the future.

Most money into bitcoin is from normal people, not bankers or hedge funds or whatever. 2017 Was a year with a big hype which resulted in way to high/fast price increases. A bubble which follows is normal in open market and it doesn't mean it comes from a manipulator. 
Derivatives can't even influence the market in that way.
How can a derivative in another market with no connection create supply on the bitcoin exchanges? People just sell because the price was to high and many early adopters might have taken a nice profit out.
Read something about bubbles/speculation maybe instead of blaming the "manipulators".

This was not about Coinbase country restriction.. Anyway i think there are plenty of options around at least the halve of the globe.
Seriously though, so you want now people to adopt to Bitcoin who find it to difficult to make an account by a company like Coinbase and send money and click the purchase button. And that seems to difficult for you and holding back "main stream adoption".
WTF?  Even in the west barely a small % of the citizens use/own bitcoin. Investors with billions around the world still don't own any bitcoin (and that's not because they find Coinbase too difficult). Their are totally different obstacles than you guys think there are.

So there has been no adoption to fiat currency for years then? All fiat currencies only go down. Yet people still seem to survive even thought they don't adopt to the fiat system in your price correlation.
I give you something to think about. Bitcoin is only fully been adopted if the prices against goods don't change more than a couple percentage on a yearly basis.

It is not how things work mate. The people who are late to the game will just have lots less than those who came in early. Look at the early adopters and today's market.
So those early adopters are slowly selling and new comers will have way less than those who took bigger risks.
For bitcoin to become a real global currency and be less volatile it firstly has to reach the current levels of on of the major currencies available.

Yes until it ends. Than money goes firstly in USD regardless what a shitcoin that is, it just is still the most temporary safe heaven. After the first big asset liquidations the money will flow to gold and maybe this time to bitcoin too.
If that money starts to flow to bitcoin prices rise absurdly quickly and everyone sees that which will make the want for bitcoin even bigger.

I think the only problem with bitcoin using it as a currency could be that the circulation (velocity) will be low. That people hold on to it because it will be worth more in the future, so actually not using it as a currency.
In theory i this might be true, but even than it will co exist, so its more like a savings account than your billing account (nothing wrong with that no?).
But even this is not really true i guess, economist say that we are perpetrated to buy things because fiat currency is inflationary. But this is wrong in my opinion. I buy things because i want an experience or an item. I don't really care about inflation/deflation at that moment. Ever heard someone saying "aah no i will buy the next iPhone as it will give more value for a buck"? No people spent time in lines to buy it NOW, no one cares that in 6 months the technology became obsolete.
A good example will be early investors who bought the ultimate goal: A Lambo! They saw early enough what bitcoin could bring (okay maybe they just got lucky). But instead of holding on to bitcoin they spent it, its a good thing though. Now instead of one person owning bitcoin worth a Lambo probably 20 people have a piece of his bitcoin holdings (so it spread wider).
So i don't think that it will solve the problem that some people will end up with "few". That's just life i suppose.

Liquidity is how many bitcoins/fiat is traded at a exchange. So if the numbers are low and there is a big sell/buy order the price can move a lot.
Margin trading is trading with borrowed money (your money/bitcoin on the exchange is the collateral). Also there is leveraged exchanges like bitmex. So let say you have 1 bitcoin on exchange xyz and you borrow the rest so you trade with 10 bitcoins in total. If the price goes in your direction your profit is a lot more than when you just bought 1 bitcoin. But if the price goes against your forecast there might be a point where you lost all your collateral, so the exchange liquidate your open trade at the market. When many liquidations happen at the same time (if the price falls or rises in a very short period) all trades influence each other so it is a snowball effect and it can create a spike like on your image. (Let say at your image a lot of sales happen in a very short period and there are no buyers left, so the prices goes down a lot, until the sales are done and people/bots realize the price is incorrect and buy it back till normal price)

Its so far ahead of us that it is hard to say what will be the circumstances in that time.
For example, at the moment bitcoin mining relies heavily on electric energy. Only in the countries where the electricity is very cheap it is basically profitable to mine bitcoin. But in my opinion in 100 years from now electricity will be basically free, there are so many ways to make electricity from that it is not scarce or valuable.

I dunno, that's what i found and i think its rather cheap.
In NL we pay \~0.22$ and across Europe prices are even higher. Generally i think in countries with low GDP per capita you get way lower energy prices. So they could potentially make a buck on mining.

Its even worse than that...
They "guarantee" you that you will not loose your first 100k. But if a bank fails, were does this 100k come from? Right, they will just invent it or let the tax payers pay for it. That 100k rule is bullshit, preventing every normal citizen to take away the money right away. It's not a rule to protect the citizens but an invention to give the false impression banks/your money is safe.
This + together with a falling euro, EU countries who go bankrupt instantly, ECB who is still printing money till today, interest levels at or below zero. This will be a huge collapse when the first domino will start to fall. There is simply no way they can fix it this time. (I do live in the EU).

Actually an interesting question. As channels gets sometimes closed for some reason and it would be not desirable when this happen if the transaction fees are high.
Let say that shitcoin node is open with many channels and suddenly when the tx fee is high he shuts down and forcing everyone a high tx fee + increasing mempool even further.

I think its also duo to the fiat money which they have available. For instance if the fiat on major exchanges is short (and a couple days to get there). It is better to pay a higher fee and keep running the businesses. They anyway make a profit so for them the premium is no problem.

Somehow banks have survived the internet age, probably because of their extreme high profit margins. They had enough money to slowly adapt and for outside players it was just too hard to start a bank in the first place. So they took their 20 years to slowly adapt to the current market (while still not really ready in my opinion).
But now they will be hit with a new tech like retail was hit 1 decades ago.

No for sure not on gut feelings. But i am also still long so don't think that i expect a big financial collapse tomorrow. To be honest it is very hard to predict such things and every time new things need to be taken into consideration. 
I'm not 100% sure but i think the book currency wars talk extensively about the last crashes from the current past and did kind of a prediction i feel related to. 
Let's be honest, the financial crisis of 2008 was a big financial collapse and although many things were wrong they haven't fixed that much. They just inflated the assets bubbles to make everyone get a "safe" feeling and meanwhile the debt burden got bigger than ever.
What i think will happen is that there needs to be a trigger somewhere (most likely from an unsuspected source). It's not hard to understand that one even triggers the other as 2008 already have shown. With countries like Italy already on the brinks of a financial collapse it is just a ticking time bomb waiting to explode. Look at Target2 for example or how the ECB is disrupting and meanwhile saving the gov debts in the EU. Without the money printing we wouldn't have been brought so far in this mess.

I just meant for Apple to show that nothing goes in a straight line. (neither up nor down). I do know what Apple does and what gives it value, it doesn't really matter here.
I think you need to look at trust. USD can only succeed as long the general population trust it. As soon as that trust disappears its over for that fiat currency.
Apple is no btc and it doesn't do the same thing. Its comparing Apple with pears.
Bitcoin will deliver this trust what people are looking for in a currency. In fact it does it better than almost anything in history. Bitcoin can have its bubbles and burst. There are many to come yet. But it keeps performing as it should. If you don't see it now, don't worry. Just watch the next crisis closely.
@_date: 2018-08-31 15:40:42
Don't know what is a swap. But its eTorro so probably a name from some CFD crap to buy fake bitcoins.
But at gdax you can trade real bitcoin for zero fee and you can withdraw them to your own wallet. The difference in sale and purchase price is often just 1 cent. (I'm pretty sure eTorro crap can't meat those standards).
Yes for euro

10X In a year is a pretty good investment. You just think now in hindsight.

A person named Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a whitepaper ([ ) and created  the first code. It's not tangible like gold for instance, but in our current state of world tangible doesn't mean much anymore. Everything goes over the web nowadays. In my opinion the predicted set rules of bitcoin is more valuable than a tangible asset.
For me it creates value as in: It's is very limited (only 21 million coins will be mined). It's very durable, as long as you keep somehow in procession of your seed code, if you do it correctly it is extremly secure. It's borderless, no one but you have control over it so if you don't like your government or need to flight for whatever reason. Your 12 word seed code is all you need to take all your capital to any place in the world and you could switch to other assets with minimal fees.
For example, the moment i have send you 1 bitcoin and it has 6 confirmations from the blockchain (it would take approximately an hour), after 6 confirmations we are sure that the transaction can not be undone. The bitcoin is yours, this cost only a couple of dollarcents and can be done whenever from any place on earth to any other place on earth.

I think you look at it from the wrong perceptive.
But first let me address LTCM, that company was over leveraged.  If you leverage your company/doings than you always have a risk if the thing which you didnt expect anyway happens. Bitcoin itself isn't leveraged in such way at all, that's the beauty of its code/math.
I think we need new blood not by marketing how wonderful it is. But we need to be the best. The best place to store wealth, the best way to pay, the best way to create new secure things. etc.
In this way people will find its way by themselves. Peter Thiel writes in his book about 10X. Something needs to be 10 times better than what you use today. If that is the case people will start to use that new technology.
I think he had proven right if you look back at how internet companies done exactly this.
So the best way to slay this beast is making it the greatest piece of technology.
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:25:46
Personally i don't use Tether. It seems a bit sketchy although on the other hand i think it works and is kind of useful in crypto space.
Coinbase pro works pretty well! Storing is a thing you need to think about carefully and read about more. Alt coins is indeed way riskier and mainly driven on bitcoin hype.
A good plan is to start with a little (for you to define), try to buy/sell it on the exchange. Send it to a wallet. See how things work first. You get a better feeling for it and with low fees it should cost you little right now. A cheap lesson which can safe a lot if something goes wrong with bigger numbers!

True and it is hard to really know the exact outcome from that. But my best guess is that it doesn't really matter.
If a failed states tries to ban something most likely the opposite will happen. Look at China for example on how they "succeeded" with the ban on capital outputs. And we talk about China here, not some open country were it will be like 10x harder. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 21:59:24

Yes with bitcoin you wouldn't have this problem. Wait for 1,3 or 6 confirmations (the more you wait the more safe, but for low value transactions that is kind of overkill).
Let say someone send you bitcoin and you got 6 confirmations. There is no way you would ever been taken away that bitcoin ever again. It is fully in control of those who owns/knows the seed codes of that bitcoin adress.

Enough places in the world with cheap energy. But yea i tend to agree with you. But there is nothing we can do about the fact that some countries run on cheap energy while other pay 10X.

When holding bitcoin you don't need drugs. As you will not feel yourself miserable everyday.
@_date: 2018-08-25 12:51:07
And someone already showed that you can even go to 0.1 Satoshi on the LN network, so we don't need a fork probably.
If the need will ever be there we could make it smaller but for now 1 Satoshi is low enough :)
@_date: 2018-08-13 11:20:19
Why you want to? It isn't becoming less volatile because of that. If you want a more strengthened bitcoin you need to work on acceptance and usage. Like working on a good payment provider for businesses in your country for example.

@_date: 2018-08-11 11:04:48
I'm not talking about the Lira or any economy in particular. 
You told: "When there are two currencies in circulation, people are going to spend the "weaker" of the two and "hodl" the "stronger". Bitcoin is BY FAR the stronger."
So i tried to explain that by doing this you give the weaker (fiat) currency a real value. If you like it or not. Let say you have dollars and bitcoin. You of course spent your dollars because they are weaker. But by doing this you give this fiat a real value. Because you probably every month earn new dollars and in the end you pay them in taxes. So although they are worthless, anyone is using them (which is exactly what gives it the value).
@_date: 2018-08-12 14:36:54
local bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-25 09:56:30
Not really in the sense of just throwing in 7k and owning one. That will take you 7k and a few minutes.
But the fact that bitcoin is pretty scared (only 21 million), will give the fact that not that many in the end can own a whole bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-15 20:41:23
Better than 1k per week. It would take a fully 19 years.
It would be never good to put everything in one assets. Yet many people get a 30 year mortgage based on two salaries for a house. Which they think is an asset but in reality is a liability.  So better give that advise to the average joe than to someone who got to the hypothetical 1m mark.
@_date: 2018-08-20 08:16:38
If someone asks you when you send the money not in once but in two transactions. Not wanting to risk a big transaction to get stuck anywhere from an exchange to your local bank is more than reasonable.
There are thousands of examples this happened in the past.

@_date: 2018-08-23 13:32:20
Leveraged trading is no problem, as it is the same bitcoin and only the traders or the whole platform can hurt itself. No problem for bitcoin itself.
Futures aren't really a problem as anyone knows that it is not bitcoin, nor underlying any bitcoin. It is just to settle prices in advance (good for bitcoin miners who want to hedge against big price volatity).
ETF can be a problem though, for :
A) ETF's can rake in so many bitcoin that it would become very centralized and one party can become too powerfull
B) People start to buy bitcoin through regular channels thinking they own real bitcoin but chosen the wrong ETF were there is 0 physical bitcoin hold.

I dont care about the bitcoin price, if you think so. For me bitcoin is just a hedge against my traditional investments. Bitcoin doesn't need a doom and gloom scenario, it works pretty well at this moment to be honest.
It will still advance much more in the future. Last week i did a international wire transfer and it took me many emails and 26$ in fees. Maybe that works not so well? I wish i could use the bitcoin system in that case. No single email needed to get my own money and a couple cents of fee.
You are way to concerned about the price it seems.
Lol USA is already bankrupt, the whole world is getting much better and quicker up than the living standards in USA. They can't create money forever as everyone will just jump off the ship. You got lots to learn. Foreigners own a big part of the American debt if you didn't know.

The basics are that the bigger the demand for the new currency the better it works out.

They don't, maybe some obscure governments from a failed state. When governments/central banks enter the bitcoin market we all driving around in Lambo's at that point. To be honest that will still take many years (if ever) and they will be one of the last to enter. Probably the poorer countries will start to hedge their USD holding in bitcoin as first.
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:31:17
It's not because a lot of those sayings aren't right. Its just that the central banks do a pretty good job into deceiving people.
Look in Europe how they pull of to sell bonds at a negative rate, give no interest in banks. All while the economy is booming and should be shown in those interest markets as well. But they just keep printing like there is no tomorrow.
Someday in the future the truth will surpass reality though.

Here you can see live transactions on a big marketplace (bitcoin exchange kraken).
So in red are people who put an offer for sale. So at the time of writing someone sells 1 bitcoin for 6492 USD.
And in green are the people who are seeking to buy bitcoin. They offer 6491.9 USD.
So the bitcoin price currently is \~ 6492 USD on Kraken. Other exchanges might have a slightly difference, but this will never be a lot as people can just buy it in one place and sell it on the next market. So this makes the price across the globe approximately the same.
If more people start to sell than there are buyers left in the market the price goes down. If people want to buy bitcoin but there aren't many sellers the price will rise. Some people buy at the current market price (market order) and others put in an order to buy at 6000 USD (limit order - so the order stays open until someone is willing to sell at 6000).
So to conclude, their is not one person, company or whale setting prices. It is an active supply and demand system which always find/search for the correct level  (this is how good markets should work).

Best thing is to start really with just like 10$ or something very small for you. Just buy it and try things out. Send it a couple of times and get a "feel" of what bitcoin is and can do. How much $$ or % you invest in bitcoin is for you to decide i think. Don't spent all on bitcoin and don't invest what you can't loose. Don't put everything in one basket.

I have still no idea how you come to this conclusion. But lets leave it with that.
@_date: 2018-08-10 10:14:46
I think it might dip first. So firstly start to liquidate all their margin buying and off chain short term debts. This needs lots of cash in a short period. (Look at gold in 2008, first it went down). So that is very short term and temporary, maybe some will sell because they are scared putting even more pressure.  But when the first blown is settled people will start to look for safe places to put their money (There aren't that many i can tell) So they will end up sooner rather than later in bitcoin, from that point the sky is the limit, i have no idea how far it will go.
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:39:02
No shit Sherlock, were i told they have 1T? I think they still have at least 100B. So imagine that, while the whole bitcoin market is worth barely more than there cash holdings. (I think actually Apple owns more fiat than bitcoin is worth but i am not really aware of accurate current stats).
@_date: 2018-08-20 17:29:45
In this rate it has the one dollar face value per coin pretty soon though. Maybe than they can use it as cash? :o

You think a couple of custodians will be the same as the current bank system? A couple of custodians can be enough for the whole world. Most likely they will not even be any connection with current banks.
And if/when people start to withdrawal their money, how would they ever have enough reserve to make their extreme low fractional reserve ratio? So now money = no mortgages/debts. 
And the latter one is what is really the main winner for the banks profits.

Start with bitcoin and don't fall for marketing scams from any other crypto coins.
Also watch out that you are not buying bitcoin cash, its a fake bitcoin.
Firstly start to read about what is bitcoin or listen to video's from Andreas. 
To buy bitcoin you have to search for some high rated exchange you can use in your country/with your fiat.
Also just buy a little (don't know what is little for you, 10$ can do the job). Just buy some at an exchange, create some wallet. Just play around with it at first. Make yourself comfortable with the tech.

It is already a better medium of exchange in many cases. But yes it is not perfect at the moment and in many cases fiat does outperforms bitcoin at the moment, but that's not a problem.
"   The more ppl hold bitcoin in hopes of it appreciating, the less it is used as a kind of currency  "

Yes true, but i think its just the start. A lot of ico's only now realize that the ETH they hold burns fast when price goes down. Many icos i suppose holded their coins from the beginning and burned quickly through there stack of money (which they raised on paper) in this way..

The author of the puzzle decided that selling his own images wasn't enough. He took back his price money and "ended" the puzzle. I did spent a fair amount of hours to this puzzle. Trying to solve it but the puzzle seemed rather strange and the author started to look more fishy, so i quit that months ago.
It's sounds like a very dishonest man to me. His businesses are: CryptoGreetings and [FOS.tv](
Not really sure where he lives (i think he is from Nothern America). But in my country you can get a lawsuit for settings up such a scam.

@_date: 2018-08-25 11:45:02
Agreed. But to be honest i think as soon as it goes up the altcoin hype will go again. Not because there is any logical. But humans are just greedy and think they can take a short cut again.
If it wasn't for bitcoin the most altcoins would have died right now.

If you buy a second house that would be an asset indeed. Or a first house and rent out some rooms. But most buy big houses with maximum mortgages to live in. All under the full pretense of "investing" for the future. So why it would be okay to buy a house when the housing market is overpriced but when you find a good opportunity you can't go all in. What a bollocks, all because you don't have to pay rent.

Bail-INS will really be interesting. They tried it in Cyprus and bitcoin became much more populair. Now all rules (as far as i know) are ready for bail ins in most western countries. And the government has more power to block certain assets outflows.
When they start to block assets and imply bail-INS everyone start to wake up and bitcoin can become very popular instantly. Than we will see how few 21m (16-17m right now) coins in our global economy really is. There is barely any supply and the price can skyrocket.

Bitcoin can or already is traded a lot by bots and HFT trading. The further we get more players will enter this market and start to also trade it in this way. They will also bring extra money to the table which stabilizes the market price. I don't think this will be ever a problem for bitcoin.
Bitcoin has a much higher market cap because many (like me) believe only in bitcoin and what it stands for. Actually i am pretty worried about how overvalued the alt market got and how people got in without a clue and get whipped out right now.
If you also want to understand why bitcoin has such market cap and in my eyes its not even that high i suggest you to investigate it further by reading some good books. I could give you some recommendations if you would like that.

Although i think it is good to have this over with. Firstly there were attacks on the system. The media did its best to tell bitcoin is dead for years. Now Ver did a social attack to trick everyone on their own controlled coin. So even having a new coin with similarities, a close name and a social enginering attack doesn't bring down bitcoin! It's good that it has been done. I think most bitcoin copies out there already died, bcaash soon will follow. Every attempt after that is known to break sooner rather than later.

I will then just explain why i did it.
Give you another example. My Bitfinex account took 8 months to be verified. (I got all the correct documents/ answers at once).
So in your opinion i should have wanted to sell my bitcoin in december at 20k and then wait for 8 months to finally liquidate it at 6k all in once.
Pretty darn risky business would that have been...
And then pray that the fiat money doesn't get somewhere stuck in the process neither.

You think they are a catch for the system? The work themselves in debt or loose once again all their money on some scam or on a lottery. They forever are in need of government support to be able to survive.
This space doesn't need the bottom 5% to be able to survive this bear market. Mass adoption is still a very futuristic thing. Try first the average (intelligent) person to convince them. Or that bitcoin becomes a standard 0.005 - 1% part of an investment portfolio.
The average person will never choice bitcoin over fiat if there are many scams going on, crazy fees on atms, high volatility and so on. It just doesn't work that way. We can all want it to happen but in that way it never will happen.

@_date: 2018-08-30 10:38:55
Agree that you need more protection on the top.
But if you are at the bottom you should not risk all on one thing to get those gains. I understand that it is preferable to make it quickly to the top. But it isn't a good way of investing. Especially that if you are at the bottom you most likely have still a lot to learn, which makes it even more risky.
That idea i think is the main driver for bubbles. Everyone gets in the same line to throw in money and because of the quick/high returns more money get attracted for that reason. But we all know that bubbles more often than not end badly. (Not implying that bitcoin is/or is in a bubble).

Yes, the most tricky part is that people just fall for it and keep believing everything they got presented.
For example, in the EU the northern countries bailed out Greece (my country for about 100B i suppose). But in reality this money just went to Greece to save the north EU banks as they were to heavily invested and they guessed that someone would bail them out if their investments went wrong. Even our state television documented this pretty well. But till this day people still think this money went to those "lazy" Greek people.

@_date: 2018-08-29 14:57:29
I don't know if you really read your article.
But let say i lend my bitcoin to a bitcoin bank, they indeed can create a FRB on my bitcoin. But this system is nothing close as we see in modern finance today. Because people would understand that the risk you take at the FRB is not worth the negetive interest so you just take out the money and put it back in your own wallet.
The system on top can and should collapse so that it stays healthy. While there is still only 21m bitcoin in total supply and nothing that much has changed. The greedy got burned and learned their lesson in the hard way. Their is no central bank to prop up the money supply to inflate away your holdings.
How is this anything close to the current system with negative interest on deposits, gov debt which went through the roof, student debt bubble ,personal debt who went through the roof, housing prices sky rocket. All while money value declines and wages are stagnant?

@_date: 2018-08-30 08:35:24
Agreed, i think even if bitcoin fails there isn't really any value as in "gold 2.0". Because if bitcoin couldn't make it and be changed by any other crypto there after can also be replaced. So in that sense if bitcoin would fail i would probably never trust the code as in as good as gold by any new crypto again.
Trust is a major value for humans. So if new code can replace the trusted one, what will stop it from doing exactly that again.

The hype is pretty much over indeed. For now, it can come back. But the fact that bitcoin is still going strong and promising what it does says enough. It wouldn't go in one straight line to a gazillion dollars. Soon more countries/people start to use it not as a hype or as a speculation but as they really need to or as it is the best option. This will happen undoubtedly in the near future.
I think SegWit is at around 40% now? It is going up. For LN it seems promising to me. I have played around with it and it seems really interesting tech. Although it is still new and it has to improve a lot. No i don't think there will be a few centralized nodes, more and more are popping up. Andreas Brekken pretty much showed that even if one node becomes the largest the LN network still preforms okay.

@_date: 2018-08-20 11:01:47
We don't really know yet. But it will be a huge event for bitcoin regardless.
My own view is that bitcoin will fall hard in the beginning. People take out there bets (margin trading etc). So the demand temporary declines. But this will be temporary only (like gold initially declined in 2008). From that moment when it bottomed fiat will start to search saver places and i do really think this time bitcoin will be a good alternative. The demand for bitcoin rises and due to few sellers the price moves up quickly. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:19:22

Yes, i think  Peer-to-peer file sharing/bittorrent is a good indication on how this is truly unstoppable.  Even though now the stakes are much higher. Firstly it was basically Hollywood and some major players. But now it is much much more on the line. Big powers and trillions of dollars.  But i never will forget that the people have the power. It doesn't matter how bad, dangerous, powerful they are. In the end the "normal" people always can start a revolution and go for what they want.

Ah, no it isn't. Its build on top on bitcoin (second layer). For users it works pretty much the same way. You have to install a wallet which has the LN available. After that you have to open a channel to a random node on the LN network. From their on you can start spending your bitcoin to those who already are ready for this new tech.
If you would have done the transaction over LN you would have gotten an invoice from that company, with qr code. Just scan the qr code and accept. The transaction takes a couple of seconds only.
You can read/look into that if you would like to. Its cool to see, but not that many companies/websites accept LN at the moment.
@_date: 2018-08-18 22:47:24
It's just that those websites are rather weird. Not something like "[goldbullion.com]( or "[gold999.com]( or like that.
Roger has a domain which is exactly like you would expect. Their is just a small difference in the name "cash" or "core" and they recommend "cash". So although yes, maybe they need to do more/better research. It's just ridiculous that such deception is here and even ranked often on the first rank. Of course people fall for that.

They dumped BTC as they couldn't dump BCH. The price would have fallen to zero. But they needed the money so BTC was their only choice.

Buy them inside the country. People want to get rid of their Lira so you get a very good rate.
Buying an inflating fiat in another country is always a bad idea as it has a bad market value outside of its original country.
@_date: 2018-08-18 19:54:12
Also if basically everytime "something better" comes around there is no store of value in any coin. As you can just copy the code any make it "better".  So that would undermine severely the price of bitcoin or some futuristic coin.
Same as another might be actually better than gold. But we will not switch suddenly.

Yes it is true, it is far from perfect and alternatives tent to be better still. But it also means there are opportunities to build systems like payal on top of bitcoin.
But on the other side look at it from the sellers perspective. He got your money on a Sunday in his "bank" account on a transaction only he can returns from now on. With luck tomorrow morning would be the earliest point he would receive that money from you in his bank account if you paid in any other form. And that money wouldn't be 100% his money yet.

Probably unsolvable, CryptoGreetings did an exit scam most likely.

Maybe we need to make some code on github to do this? I'm not really a coder but i just thought about this. I think multiple people are interested in setting up auto buys.
You can send credit in advance and that the code auto buys daily/weekly whatever as you wish. The fees will be low (or even zero when using gdax).
You can than make an auto transaction into coinbase from your bank and it is fully automated.

Yes you are right, but i think even at this rate they are able to sell their equipment at good margins. Maybe indeed lower than in 2017, but its still not bad and it can easily turn when btc price also turns.
@_date: 2018-08-13 11:44:35
I understand what you are looking for but not that i am aware of.
Visa versa there are payment processors who does this for the seller.
It depends on the country, in some countries it is really easy to buy bitcoin (my country for example). I can go to a dutch website which accept the local payment processors so i can send euro and they send bitcoin to an address of my choice. But it depends on the country how easy this process is.

No paper gold as in that there are more people "owning" gold than that there in reality is (hence gold on paper).
I think the ratio is like 80 to 1. So 80 people think they own 1 bar of gold while in fact that 80 people own the same bar (serial number) in gold. So 79 have invested in thin air.

Might be. But its anyway a trial, so they should at least make it with a good intention.
I really like this idea (if the fees would not be crazy high). As a tourist i often find myself with useless cash and both in my house i still got some of everything or i buy useless overpriced stuff in an airport.
Also an ATM would be cool to get the local currencies in any airport. But yet again, the fees should be closer to 2% to be more compatative with a normal ATM's.

@_date: 2018-08-30 14:30:05
Yes i agree with you. 
The only problem with precious metals i have is that i highly suspect they are just getting priced as how central banks want it. Central banks would not like if everyone start to buy gold. Because it will diminish the fiat currency.
There are multiple signs that they act against the market (most recognizable would be the return of German gold). Gold's characteristics are good. But with Central banks as a major player, some strange location decisions from countries, China who now  remelt all bars in Swiss, no audits from biggest vault, imf/war situations whereby gold is on the move in strange ways, gold repatriation whereby serial numbers are incorrect. Makes it all a bit fishy.

Wtf dude, do your own research before coming with such arguments. They just have a loss on paper, that is something total different than selling all their products with a negative margin. They keep inventing new things which eats up all their money.
Miners are not doing R&amp;D or building a new e-reader. They don't do business to undercut a certain miner, as always a new player somewhere in the world with a lot of money can throw them out business too...
Yes i told about gold mining, they don't mine when a gold ounce goes for 1000$ and their cost of mining is 1500$ an ounce. They better could do nothing then and buy an ounce on the spot market and spent the other 500 on blow.

They can't manipulate their way into having major control over bitcoin. Sure they will try their dirty tricks. But bitcoin is already under attack for 10 years and it is thriving. Failed attacks from banks will let it thrive even wilder/faster.
The big difference is that it will not work is because you can easily store bitcoin (okay maybe not super super easy), but way easier then gold. Gold had some problems which made banks useful or even needed in most cases.
With bitcoin there is actually really not needed any 3rd party which isn't totally bullish on bitcoin itself.

Even when 50% of the gold reserve was sold, meaning they just had an awful lot before. When they have like zero gold and would require a 50 Billion loan from the world bank or IMF sure it would matter. But now they are just doing fine like any other major economy/country.

For the first time in history we have something as good as bitcoin for storing value. Storing value is basically what great societies made them the greatest (look back in the history of gold).
Now we have improved gold, so that we can store it better, it is more rare (over the long run as yearly supply will drop below that of gold). + You can use it for all kinds of things like: "within two seconds for free without asking for permission".

@_date: 2019-03-28 18:48:00
True, but slowly people will understand. Meanwhile bitcoin is just putting higher numbers out every few years. Which also will widen the interest.
I think slowly the bitcoin benefits will be understood by more and more people. Next thing i think will get very big soon is that people in foreign countries (i lived in such one), who have a weak economy/currency nowadays hedge their wealth in mainly usd/eur.
Slowly but surely more people their will get their hands not on those currencies (it is hard to get them), but bitcoin will be spread their too. What they search is a hedge against their own currency with low inflation. The good thing is that they then not only can find it in bitcoin.

94% of the euro is digital. With (almost) negative interest rates and inflation of 1-5% there is really nothing nice about it.

So gold is the safe heaven to those loans.
My country basically has between 60-80% debt-to-gdp and pay like zero % interest on those loans. Yes we do have gold and so we are a very long track record of good finance + strong/stable currency.
Unfortunately we traded our currency for the shitty euro and now are handed over to the devil. But gold certainly has a function in modern society. Even though it isn't backed currencies directly, sure central bankers keep it into their minds and use it as leverage to those who own zero gold.
BTW i'm not really a big fan of gold or something, but i see the relevance in it in modern times even though it isn't really been used for decades by now.

The thing is that it are mostly private organizations who have nothing to publish. And that not in one country but on a global scale.
So much further than a good guess you will never get. If hash rate goes up while price is not going up it means that there are still decent margins as someone is putting more money in and still not running in negative margins.

I would consider moving then if i were in your shoes, i have a relative open minded government and the chances they will block bitcoin by themselves will be zero.

Send a little of bitcoin 0.0005 or so to the wallet, open a LN channel with someone (they indicate some well known ones). 
Then send some Satoshis in and out the Jar on this website:

It's what gives it value. The countries where the hoarding mentality is the strongest have often the strongest economies. The countries where the currency gets spend in seconds have a very weak economy. 
But central bankers/economist love to spread this false idea though.


That you can literally do also with many shit coins, but it doesn't give any value. So its like giving a hot potato around without acknowledging that it has value. When something has value you can still do the same thing as you told, but you don't have to panic that it stop having its value overnight. So sure, it is a major benefit that you can trade your saved value in such way. But your bitcoin keeping its value is way more important.

@_date: 2019-03-29 08:55:23


So? US debt is mainly owned by others, while Japanese debt is owned by themselves. Which makes the USD way weaker to such events than it does to the JPY.


True, that is the main reason why they used the rest of the world as a creditcard to take on debt financed by others, not likely it will last that much longer before the world gets back at them to pay up.


Someone has to pay, it doesn't matter if it is direct or indirect. Switzerland is printing the same amount of money as the US (To keep the exchange in par \~), but instead of wasting the money they will buy American real assets. Do you understand which of the two benefit and can keep that game going on way longer?
You can't print indefinitely, at some point someone is going to catch up. Fiat always fails in the end, its just a matter of when US and its USD is gameover. With this speed and new technological advances like bitcoin it isn't going to take that long anymore. Maybe 3 decades or so.

That is indeed a well placed lie which comes back over and over again in those peoples arguments.
@_date: 2019-03-16 13:46:31
It is a solid argument against bitcoin that it is hard to give it a "correct" price. It is true that it is rather impossible to give it a decent price tag. It can be easily from 1k$ to 100k$ right now. 
But we just let the market decide and if it is working correctly (without too much bad actors), the market price is rather correct in general.
People do not understand that this is about many things in live. Like gold for example or even land prices. 
We will probably going through a couple more big boom/bust cycles ever increasing attention to more people who will recognize the benefits bitcoin has to offer. And slowly the world will value bitcoin more precisely.

Good luck with that when the interest to roll the debt forever is higher then the tax you can generate. Sure in theory you are right, in practice everything is connected and you can't do such thing. 


Yea sure, it never happened before right?
But okay, lets see how the US will cope with the next 50 years. Don't get me wrong, i do love USA for its economics too.

I can't find accurate data (the one i saw before isnt really correct) but the velocity of the euro isn't high and has been falling to a low point, at least for the last time i checked.
A 2% deflation still incentive investments, just not the bad investments. The stock market is doing 6-8% a year, so even at a 2% deflating currency you should prefer stocks, if you are clever. It just takes the pressure of taking bad investments (for example European negative bonds..). Who in the right mind gives the government money and pay for that "privilege".
Only because the whole money system is so f*cked up such things do happen.
The whole idea that 2% inflation is good for the economy is just a big scam. Let say bitcoin will be just 0%, no inflation nor deflation. I am 100% sure that it would outperform any fiat currency with any inflation number. 
If you look in history, the countries with stable and strong currencies prospered. Not because of inflation, but because the societies could trust the money system and build a future on it.
And as soon as someone started to profit from that trust (inflate/debase etc) those prosper nations started to break down.

You can create a shitcoin in seconds. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 08:32:03
Then the usd wouldn't really be used as a measure to find the price point anymore.
Look for example at Venezuela or Weimar Germany, at that point its just worthless paper to you. You buy a bread today and it cost you 1000 USD and tomorrow it wil cost 5000 USD. Every paper bill you earn you will want to spent it directly on something that you can buy for it which is worth something to you. Food/cigarettes etc.
Fiat is good in finding the price point and its normally stable and very accurate. But in such times and if one of those big currencies fail basically there is no real fiat anymore in the world. At least Venezuela could still use USD besides there own currency. 
Then it becomes barter like style commerce. How many gold/bitcoin are your baker and you willing to accept to make a deal? But most likely for example bitcoin will become then the main use of commerce and everyone know how much a bitcoin is worth for them (not in USD value but in real purchasing value).

Central banks don't really worry about low prices, so they will let it fall. Anyway banks like from China and Russia will keep stashing gold at lower prices.

I got euro and dollar. Even those two worlds biggest fiat currencies move heavily against each other with sometimes having a way to big volatility. 
Actually the whole inflation game is very clever by design, many don't really understand it and can hardly ever out "safe" the inflation, hence they need to work their whole life and be "productive". While few understand the game very well and have the means to profit from it till the max. In my opinion both inflation and debt are used to enslave the current society.

Then others will start setting up a way to protect bitcoin. Besides not all countries are ready to terrorize their citizens, so those countries will flourish.


Oh lol, how adorable...


You know that now the dollar and partly the euro are used for that right? If all failing nations start to use the bitcoin instead we have a world wide problem. It will only give bitcoin credit above the USD. And this is a likely path which will make bitcoin succeed. This is exactly how bitcoin is showing how good it is and the people will find it naturally over time.
I understand what your saying about the last part. But i can show you that it is not true. I am from the Netherlands. One of the wealthiest countries and before the euro we had one of the strongest currencies. We literally have no need for bitcoin. Yet we run one of the most nodes per capita. Many people are interested, we have a good structure of local exchanges and companies who are building on it. Many people/programmers are interested and working on it. Even the government isn't totally hostile to it. Sure, we will use bitcoin differently then an average Venezuelan. But bitcoin gives use cases from the poorest to the most wealthy people in the world.

Let see, i come from a country were banks are pretty stable. The currency is (or at least was before the euro) pretty good. Low inflation and few ways to lose money. Don't doubt that 98+% will not believe that the card or atm can stop working one day. They pay for free and the systems are pretty user friendly. At the moment they have zero need for bitcoin payments or the like.

Thats the point, that is not true at all. Ask how all the booking agents profit from the system booking.com is build. Nothing, they all lost their jobs and a few investors now earn big time. Same with many other technologies, to say that technologies benefit everyone in a society is ridiculous.
And to say that people need to learn new/better or other skills is also ridiculous, the current development of all the tech is going faster than people can keep up with it through their jobs. What all those million of bankers going to do, selling bitcoin? I saw a study that over half of all jobs will disapear in the next couple of decades.


Lol, yes it is much better to let (skillful) people do minimum wage jobs instead of taking some money from the people who can miss it. I love it how in America two people work at a cash desk in supermarkets while in EU in many countries no people work at the cash desk. Much better indeed to pay low wages for something a machine can do and let instead human waste millions of hours of living.


You are silly like that. In the near future many will be unemployed by choice (actually in the western world many many people already live in this way). They get paid regardless and the world will benefit in other ways than through there (often useless) jobs.

But i think for many it is still too early. No institution wants to be the sucker who lost as only one in the bitcoin hype. If there are multiple good options to buy in, it is safe for them to do so. Multiple start to go in as the ones who takes the risk and others will follow not to be left out of the boom.

Housing market is totally disrupted. Real estate prices are high in most countries mainly due to the governments right to give out building permits. By restricting the amount of building permits they keep an lower availability of new houses compared to the demand. If you do it long enough people go crazy and start overbidding to get at least any house. Together with a bank which gives high mortgages to let people live their "dream" the whole system of housing scam is complete. I have tpo often seen people paying a way to high price for a shitty house.

Not impossible but way less likely i would say.
Because now you can just withdrawal your real money to anything you would like. So everyone is trusting the party until we all just stop trusting it and everyone will withdrawal their money and those who can't anymore have learned a new lesson and will show it in the future as an example.
Basically with your government money you don't really have a chose, all banks are doing the same thing. Central banks are promoting it. Government it self has no clue what is going on. And we the people are obliged in one way or another to play their game.

The total supply stays the same. The available supply will be a bit less if we know how many are unavailable. 
Let say we now discount for satoshi's 1 mil bitcoins and somehow in a couple of years he anyway activates them and dumps them all.

Maybe in your mind, but in my mind i just have a yearly loss/profit regardless of sales.


There is a huge difference between the market cap of different assets, if they are overpriced you can short them if they are undervalued you hoard them. Yes sometimes some markets are in a bubble, but that doesn't make the mcap factor just pure shit. It has more to do with the temporary (dis)believe into something.
The mcap defines the total price of a product. If you don't like the total price, why you would pay that price for just a small piece? In an open good functioning market that isn't a problem neither.

Watching the price has zero influence and if you keep holding anyway it is even stupid (it might trigger you in doing something you don't really want).
Just set some alerts at levels you want to know for sure and watch monthly/ quarterly etc.
I do watch the bitcoin price, but only to see if i can take an advantage from it. But i could easily do as written above.
If you don't planning to buy or trade better focus on making bitcoin better. Learning more about bitcoin, or just do whatever you want to do instead :)
@_date: 2018-10-23 07:43:42


It does have value of course. For example in crypto currency you can see how the market cap of bitcoin is the biggest of all. You can't really tell that from the price. Or you could compare it to gold.
Or for example compare silver to gold. Normally people compare it and say silver is 1 / xx of golds price. But what if you don't take into account that now there are huge silver mines and the market cap/total supply doubles yearly (just an example). That would give you a huge different picture then just by looking at the price per ounce.
@_date: 2018-10-29 17:51:10
Yes so (new) available options will be used to keep trading.

Yes, Coinbase is a website/exchange/business though.
You can send/receive bitcoin on a btc address. When you do it for the first time try firstly a small amount that you are comfortable losing. In this way you lose only a fraction if you did something wrong (many have found that out the hard way). Always double check if the address is correct.
Just try things out, play with it a bit, you will feel more comfortable soon! Protect your mnemonic seed (12-24 word) with your life, be careful with those.

But that idea is just absurd. Tether didn't build last year's bull market.
Didn't you feel the real hype? I know people who work in plants or at the mcdonalds who became rich from trading crypto. Some people cashed out and are now retired in their 30's. This is not all due to Tether. Many average people pumped in money last year by themselves. Real euro's and dollars which they worked hard for.

If you sell your house at a given price, you would be okay that your price goes down 10-15% in the next hour? At the moment bitcoin is just really volatile compared to dollars/fiat. You can't disagree with this.


I totally agree, in my country there isn't even a downpayment (as no one really can't afford it, lol). But that is a total different story (scam), we were talking just about the transaction here.


Most countries are developed enough were you can pay digitally and often through a third party like a notary. Most likely it is even illegal to pay for in cash without a very good story from where you got those bills.

Yes and it creates asset inflation (higher stock prices/house prices), which they indicate that they want. But this only benefits the high net worth, their loans inflate away while their assets rise in value.
Meanwhile the average person floats in all kinds of debts, which is close to unbearably. But its going exactly according to their plan..
@_date: 2019-03-29 10:19:08
Still it is much better to just stay at the same price, if it doesn't matter. Its easier for the mind, it saves human time by not changing the fiat dominations, the prices for the shop/system can stay the same too.
What if you don't want to eat 100 Burgers a week from my salary but save 40 burgers for later times? Is there then still no problem? Oh yes then i can suddenly by 4 burgers instead of 40 i saved for later..

@_date: 2018-10-24 19:24:18
In a total different way but i would say yes. Money/currency/store of value evolves over the years.
If you put it on a timeline with means of payments it really looks like a new innovation.
Although it is still early. For store of value it better has to weather the first global financial crisis first to see how it respond to that. Until now it has been good, but in a rising market anyone looks smart.
For international transactions it is very useful and competitive. Without restriction and at very low cost sending money within a day would beat any other current option i guess.
Paying locally your bread and other groceries not so much yet. For that it is too slow, has too high fees, too complicated. But bitcoin isn't an out of the box finished product, it can be improved and future innovations (LN for example) could start to compete with any form of payments.
So yes it is very innovative. In many ways (more than i addressed here though, think also about privacy, securely, without restriction/control).

It's just the protocol. It started with 50 BTC rewards and halfs down now to 12.5 BTC.
There might have been a time when blocks are found faster but i don't really recall that. Bitcoin is designed to adjust itself so the more people start to mine the harder it becomes but the reward and time should stay the same. Although at the beginning days that might have been less accurate.

Bitcoin is not the mother of all scams, with 100Bil its a tiny one even if its a hundred percent scam. In the world of finance 100B is really nothing. 
He talks about 50 dollar fees as if they are standard and you can't pay coffee with that. No shit Sherlock you can't pay coffee with a $40 international wire fee either. Luckily i did a 1 cent transaction earlier today and LN is up and running (probably he will get known about LN in the year 2030 or sth).
He told 90%+ transactions in bitcoin are done for illegal business while a report shows that the amount of transactions for illegal purpose is staggering low.

Yea its like the economist standard answer. And it might even be true, look most people with a normal job need to work their buts off to just get around. Then they have a hard time reaching pension age to live some years "free" if everything went right.
If you want to make something for yourself you need to work your butt off even more and invent something, work more cleverly, or whatever way to get away from this debt slavery threat mill.
On one side i think its goods, its those human inventions which can get us very far. But on the other side, look how for example automation technology mainly give benefits a few. Automation on way way is beautiful, more work gets done with less effort and less time. But mostly some business or rich person takes all the benefits while the workers get out of a job and need to do some other very competitive job. (For example how driver less cars/trains/trucks will put millions of people out of a job. They will lose their main source of income and will need to start to compete in some other sector, putting a higher supply their and pressuring the wages even lower).
So in my opinion innovation is great, but not for mankind in general. Maybe bitcoin (a real hard money) could get away many people from this debt slavery system. Maybe it wouldn't work. We will see.

I don't think banks are liquidating gold as they can just print the USD or other fiat they get anyway. Its really rather useless. And they all know it is useless fiat and want to hedge against each other. If such parties do really get into bitcoin things can get wild really quick indeed.


Yea true, i think we will just go into another boom and after that bust cycle with both a way higher ath and the low will not be near 4k$ anymore. Bitcoin will spread further, new technology will be build/thought off, the idea gets into more heads, etc.


Thats for sure.


Yes, financial things move slower than general adoption of technology. Especially something like bitcoin were you can/will transfer your life savings over from fiat to bitcoin. Not something you do with the same ease as buying a 250$ smartphone and get used to that.

As a small business owner you are really just a pawn in the hands of a banker though. They take huge fees, they do their own thing etc etc.
Nowadays you can fight their system a bit with new players around, but still they own basically the whole payment system. 
Internet was never really a problem for them as they just moved from physical banks to online banks in the last two decades, they are still the same players in power and they took their time to slowly move to the internet. 
Bitcoin will be the first real enemy for them since like forever.

Your comment, if there are no miners bitcoin will fail. You understand that one right? We need miners and miners need us (bitcoin holders/users).
You understand the bitcoin protocol right that there is a halving every xxx blocks. Now the reward is 12.5, in about 1.5 years it is 6.25 BTC. Going down ever further. So gradually the miner fee will exceed the coinbase reward. It is not a sudden happening. 
How it exactly will work out i think no one really knows yet, there are too many uncertainties. Let say the price goes down another 80% from here on till the next halving. So many miners will not even make it till the next halving. Let alone for the next hundred years.
It can be for example that we will all start to use LN or other layers as main channel. Paying very small fees on those layers while doing once in a while high fee transactions. Of course no one wants/can pay $50 for a coffee transaction. But we could pay 50$ for a batched transaction with many transactions inside (look for example at transactions from exchanges right now).
Although i understand where you are coming from with your question, i also wondered about that. But i think due to the protocol and the fact that it is long in the future it is not really a main concern. We have to get there in the first place. Eventually we (humans) figure such "problems" out. (Not really the most assuring fact i know)

Why it is not ideal?

Yes it involves risk. But the risk of not investing is way higher. As one day or another reality strikes in and you are left behind by far.
The problem is most people invest badly (if they talk about that investing is risky). They put everything in their business, bitcoin, house, a single or couple stocks, bonds or whatever investment they made.
But take for example bitcoin. If you invested one percent of your net wealth into it the risk would be very small. As one per cent loss is not that much. But in almost any case of more than 1 year the returns are exceptional.
@_date: 2018-10-17 16:36:13
Right? It doesn't.
But so many people believe in it so it probably will anyway. Not because of any good reason, just because many people will think it does.
Also every halving it becomes less meaningful. Next halving bitcoin rewards will be 6.25 BTC. So that will result in a daily miners supply of approx 900 BTC (at today's prices around 6 million usd a day). Compare those numbers with the bitcoins in circulation, exchanged daily etc and you will see that it is a relative small number.

Nothing wrong with an unregulated market who corrects itself. The current financial system is sick as that doesn't work anymore how it supposed to work.
There will be no Mt.Gox anymore as it will be very doubtful bitcoin will ever getting close to such concentration. My point was that bitcoin survived that and from that moment surviving a tether/bitfinex is a piece of cake. 
It can take many events as it is not a bitcoin problem. Would you stop using banks if we now get a second big financial crisis? No of course not, we still use them even while by now most people (should) know better. We just keep creating the same bs.
Tether is just a small tool, i don't know why you think it will hurt bitcoin that much.

What is your goal? Just flipping it for 10k? So you have a 25% profit? That makes your 250 worth 312.
And then? Not come back? Try to flip it again?
Getting your investment ideas/goals in your head or written down is a first way to make a strategy.
There are many ways to play this thing, you are not wrong or right, just know for yourself what you would like to get out of it.

That is really your argument for fiat fractional reserve? That bitcoin can do the same? Seriously?
Let me illustrate too, i am a customer and a 70 dollar ledger will completely put my need for a bank or central bank away.


No it isn't as with bitcoin we check the blockchain ledger, not a bankers ledger.


That is some accusations you made here, can you please indicate which ones and show us some proof? For banks i can easily show the proof, just go to a random bankers website, pull their annual report and read the assets/liabilities statement.

Look at cnbc or whatever financial news channel, it is just hours and hours of bollocks everyday. With experts who predict busts to experts who predict moon.
Look how Goldman Sachs sold bad products to its clients and speculated against it to make a solid profit on them.
Even with all the regulation and so on its still a wild wild west of finance. In bitcoin/altcoin with no regulation there is no limit. Scams, ponzi's, so called experts. It's all here, most of them just are just in it to earn a quick buck for themselves.
There are some good information sources out there (Andreas for example), but always keep your guard up and think why that person is telling you something.

Of course bitcoin is a serious threat, they do realize it by now. It is just not yet a problem. When bitcoin hits the gold market cap you still think its not a threat?

Yes you can buy/sell bitcoin on Coinbase. It depends on how long you are planning to keep bitcoin, best practice is always to put bitcoin in a wallet. There are many options. 
CB also has a vault were you could put bitcoin (but it has some risks, but setting up your own wallet without knowing for sure what you are doing has also some risks).
You can just buy 5$ and send it to an electrum wallet for example, just play around and see how it all works. Pretty interesting stuff.
Bitcoin can be a good investment but most traders (in stockmarket) lose money, so that will be no different from bitcoin. If you just want to make a quick buck without a plan or knowledge you are more likely to lose it.
A good way to start would be to buy the book: "the bitcoin standard".

But i don't think all banks will and should go bankrupt. It's just an extra option for us now to use bitcoin by not using their services. Banks never really had any competition and they own the government.
Some banks will adjust and some will bust, but for the foreseeable future we still might need them.
@_date: 2018-10-12 07:36:47
It wasn't reasonable hence why it tanked.
But it has to do with adoption/knowing cycle. I knew bitcoin just before the big run in 2013 (didn't buy), and last year a much bigger group of people got known to bitcoin. But it isn't always that people hear about something and directly buy, bitcoin slowly wins trust of people, i only really started to trust bitcoin in 2017. Bitcoin at 20k isn't absurd, it still a small toy in the world of finance.
Many people will be surprised by the next "bubble", institutional money barely even touched bitcoin! Can you imagine when they are finally allowed and having enough trust to buy and hodl bitcoin as well?

It's like saying you must feel pretty stupid for buying the house and now one year later you are down 5%.


That's how "news" works. In the years before the ATH in the stockmarket, there is no stopping about how great everything is. A bright future, wonderful results, no unemployements. While in the debts of a crisis while stock market is at its bottom the "news" keep telling that the world will end very soon.
AKA never listen to them and spent your time more wisely.

Yea, luckily i Couchsurfed at a kind of "hippy" couple. I learned a lesson or two from them! They were still very young but not owning much. Just some basics and like to garden themselves to grow some veggies.
They almost didn't work and had heaps of free time and more important fun things to do then those people with big cars, big houses and huge stress levels. It really made me swift minds. Also his book recommendation about: "Debt: the first 5000 years" did me well :)

Yea its funny, i read some post yesterday from just beginning 2017. They were talking about that it might be a possibility to hit 10k this decade. And some told no we would go down first to the more logical 700 range.

It's how capital works my friend. The supply/demand on an exchange is always a fraction from the real market. But there is were price for both a buyer and seller finds its price. (For major deals people tend to trade them OTC "over the counter", as big amounts might be hard to buy/sell. This can be with a premium/discount to the market price we see daily).
Yes if someone drops a lot of coins on one exchange it sets off the price. But 160k coins will not bring it to 1$ forever. Your 1bil deal is about 25% of the daily volume (according to CMC), basically even if you would drop them in one move you would only temporarily move the price. It will be a massive shock at one exchange, but people will arbitrage it over all exchanges. And if the price is really at 1$ many orders will flow in and move the price up again.
@_date: 2019-03-14 18:07:19

Unlike bitcoin real estate can easily go to below zero.
A million plus mortgages were underwater in the last crisis in my country, meaning that the market value was lower than the debt owed to the bank. That in a country with 17mil citizens :)
Luckily the government and banks with help of central banks printed money saved the day for now. It will be funny to see those faces again when their house for a second time in 10 ish year is below their mortgage! :)
@_date: 2018-10-25 12:16:35
Why they would admit it? Might be that they don't do it themselves, that can be indeed. But i'm not sure though. Because when the USDT price is more than a dollar it means a trader would lose money on it plus taking the risk of tether not been backed at all. No trader expect Tether themselves would ever do such trades no?
By buying up the price back to one dollar (arbitrage) they don't admit they are not backed. They put the money were their mouth is and use "REAL" dollars to get the price back to par. Kind of the idea of a stable coin and real backed dollars no?

How you know that the positions are tiny? I think bitfinex shorts you can find, but from bittrex? But it is not only leveraged positions, it is also money which shouldn't have been invested in bitcoin in the first place (or any other market). That money will be pulled out too.
Of course other classes are bigger as they exist way longer. There are barely products on top to short bitcoin.

A "hot" or "cold" wallet is something different than an exchange. Your coins may actually be stored in a cold wallet on the exchange too. But that doesn't mean you can not actually lose them! 
If you really want to keep them on an exchange, maybe think about spreading it over 2/3 exchanges. But how "large" an amount is really depends on you. Basically i think a good rule it to think how you feel if you lost it. If you really can't miss that money for sure it's too much. If you can miss it but it still would make you feel bad it probably still is too much.

And you know what? Somehow my computer can connect to those online casinos in Malta, isn't that weird? And thanks to the European Union i don't even have to pay taxes myself although my country claims them, Malta doesn't. Wonderful online world isn't it?

If your address was invalid it should never have left your coinbase wallet? Look back in coinbase there should be the bitcoin or an address with tx info you send it to.

Just help improving bitcoin if you want to do something (coding, making it available in your country, exchange, whatever you r good at).

That money will not get us over 100k indeed.
People who will buy at 100k will buy because of the bitcoin features.
Basically bitcoin is the biggest trust mechanism we have ever seen before and the funny part is that it will become more trust able as the price increases. 
The people who (almost all) still will have to buy-in: millionaires/billionairs/ investors / all kind of funds, they will buy in one day. Even if it is just 1% of their portfolio/net worth. It will be a huge boost for bitcoin. And those investors very well know that bitcoin will be the asset to buy and not Ripple because it is priced cheaper. Ever seen such person buying steel instead of gold because it is a cheaper metal?

They will when a merchant provides them a discount. But in most cases probably not.
But i'm not having the impression that crypto will replace any form of current payment anytime soon. As long as this system works they keep using it.

True, but a clever vendor should give a discount. If the fees on Visa are 2% he should give a 1% discount on bitcoin transactions, so they both profit from it.

Then you are talking about real large transactions. If you transact for example 25.000 BTC to a know exchange wallet and start to liquidate it the market will react before you can sell it.

It depends on which service you use, but $1000 doesn't seem a problem to me. And for sure it is not a problem for them, they also sell this bitcoin you give them on the open market and get fiat (usd) in return. And they keep a small percentage for their service. If they have all the things in order they can do it indefinitely.
Remember that you can also accept bitcoin for your business and not rely on 3th party services. You could use btcpay:

Their might be decades of no profit in bitcoin someday, yet it still offers anything which will make it work.
Price and value are two different things. A decade of negative returns in gold or stocks doesn't make them (all together) disappear. It just wasted a lot of time, energy, resources and probably it started with too high expectations to begin with. But in the end it still works.
@_date: 2018-10-07 09:34:02
You think me as a merchant is paying the 1-3% fees?
If bitcoin can be systematically cheaper and customers are willing to use it, one day Supermarket A will give a discount by paying with this new payment system to be more competitive with Supermarket B.
And even i doubt Visa is free as before i had a Visa card which cost me 45$ a year. (So lets assume bitcoin cost 0.15 per transaction, that means i need to do more than 300 transactions a year to have an advantage).

OTC market of course does influence the market. If there are more buyers OTC then sellers prices will move up. The main reason OTC exist is to make deals which shouldn't be done in the open market in the first place. If you for some reason have thousands of BTC and you need to "dump" them, it is way better to find a buyer who buys large chunks of that. To dump big chunks of money in an open market affects the price negatively (which you don't want as a seller).
That whole story also works visa versa, so big buyers and sellers come onto agreement outside of the market. That can even be done at a discount or premium to the real market price, depending on the sentiment.
@_date: 2018-10-22 21:21:09
Currencies in general not really have a market cap i think. There is in currency in circulation stats but that is not really the same imo.
Not really sure what your question is though. A Market cap doesn't really say much, for example for gold it is pretty hard to say how much has been mined of the years and how much is lost again. So a market cap is just an estimate. For bitcoin it is a bit more precise although the lost coins are hard to say (if you want to subtract those).
Further market cap is just a fact based on the market price of something. Basically the unit market price sets a market cap. But people are more attached to the unit price in general.
@_date: 2018-10-30 10:25:22

Think of it in this way.
In fiat we start adding zeros to the system. A 10.000 usd house now cost 100.000 or 1.000.000 usd. As inflation eats away the value.
We keep 1 unit. So even if only 1 bitcoin is left we still have the basic unit. We just add zeros behind the comma. You can divide it indefinitely same as you can add zeros indefinitely (ask Zimbabwe or Weimar).

@_date: 2018-10-17 20:17:55
I know what is supply and demand, but it might help OP indeed.


No wonder as only they can provide the market with new coins (at an easily forecast-able rate). My points is that miners bring after the next halving a maximum of 900 BTC a day to the market. While according to CMC today on a daily basis 4 billion$ has been traded, that is 634.000 BTC. So the miners have a market supply input of just 0.0014% or at today's mining rate (1800BTC a day) 0.0028%.
So even if those CMC numbers are heavily overrated, still the percentage stays fairly low and at a point we almost could conclude that it doesn't matter at all.
The bigger influence by far will be the human brain who would think that bitcoin becomes more scarce at that moment.

Not really. Once its stable it will be stable for long (maybe centuries). I'm not really sure it will ever get to that state though, there are many many very powerful people and businesses who don't want a stable world currency.
But lets say people really trust bitcoin and we are at the point that everyone use it as main way to do commerce it will be very stable. Probably much more stable then any other store of value/currency ever was up until now.
Of course many people are in it for the gains, but that is how a capitalistic system works. Many people who were early investors in Apple, Amazon or Microsoft they are now very wealthy and cashed out long ago. Nothing wrong with that, the people who invest early reap the biggest reward but also take the biggest risk.

Economy is doing pretty well. Not super good but also not super bad. Market was a bit overheated but likely to increase imo.
Actually everyone is already looking for a major collapse so the chances that it will happen now are rather small (be a contrarian). Of course something could trigger it, but such events can happen always and are impossible to foresee.
But protect yourself if you feel the need, bitcoin might be a good option. At least it is YOUR money with no other person to control it, if you save them correctly. If it will be the place in a market crash is hard to say, as bitcoin haven't seen any major collapse. Likely it will fall first as liquidity is getting low in market crashes.
@_date: 2018-10-30 08:12:41

Yes as i told if it hits double digits for sure bitcoin can be used to hedge against inflation.
But what is actually the supply inflation in dollar? I'm pretty sure it is already higher than that of bitcoin.
I think in every bitcoin bubble just more people get interested/attracted to bitcoin. To be honest the last bubble made me also really enthusiast, while i did know bitcoin for many years. Next bubble will attract more institution money and main street. Maybe they will only then understand the bitcoin supply inflation, that can be. Many people might have heard of bitcoin but have no clue about the details behind it.

You probably use an illiquid exchange. For example i just checked you could buy for 125k$ bitcoin on Coinbase directly in EUR. So if you would put a limit order at 1 cent lower you literately will save only 1 cent/coin.
But yes, limit can be better in some cases, but it should save you that much. I use both from time to time, in a volatile market with big price swings buying market can be easier as you may put a limit order who never gets filled anymore. Algorithm trading can put orders above yours and keep yours from filling. Which could result in huge unrealized profits if bitcoin decided to move up.
Joel Greenblat a famous investor in his book written even to buy stocks at market price and don't care much about that last quarter point. The chance you are missing something big time will cost you far more than you will ever spent on those market orders.

It's hard to even believe that those millionaires can't put 0.005% of their wealth into just 1 bitcoin. The main reason why they don't i come up with is that the don't feel the need to do so (yet).

No it can't you can't get below zero while buying bitcoin. But buying a house with mortgage most certain can accomplish that dream. (At least in most cases, depends on laws etc).

Ask how that went in Greece/Cyprus of one of the other thousand examples. Banks work until they don't. At that point it is too late. So partly the IV of bitcoin is that if you stored the bitcoin correctly you and only you can access it for the next 100 years. (Even with gold that is pretty hard to accomplish).
For example you can try to get your hands on bitcoin in China, China has many capital restrictions. So you have bitcoin on your 12 seed wallet in your brain. At that point you can send it, but also take it across borders where-ever you like. People from war zones can take bitcoin to more safer areas. People from America can take it to Europe. While its hard to bring more than 10k cash, a bar of gold, or any valuable items. You store your billions into bitcoin and can go everywhere. Now you buy a cheap phone, enter the seed and pay for a coffee in Norway in minutes at very competitive transaction rates.

No problem. Ideas are easy though bringing them to live is way harder.

I stopped doing my research as i understood electricity was already too expensive in my place to efficiently mine. The miners sold were goofy as they not always arrived (in time).
This was not in 2010 though. But i wish someone just told me put 2000$ in bitcoin instead of mining it. It would be very profitable and not very hard to accomplish.
Instead i left mining/buying for a long while, slowly seeing it going up and up -.-
@_date: 2019-03-30 10:40:23


It doesn't have to, it can default on its entire loan and not much will happen with the loan itself. Watch how that played out over and over again for the particular country who decided to do so. + You still think that the US will have the USD as the worlds reserve currency with all its perks when they decided to do such things? So sure, the US needs to pay back the loans and keep all its allies happy just for the sake to be able to be happy themselves too.


That is exactly what is going to happen when the reserve currency status will diminish or varnish. Some previous examples: UK, NL, Spain, Portugal
Sure, it would be nothing like Venezuala as that is impossible to do so. But i bet hundreds of millions of US Americans will get extremely angry and dissatisfied with what will happen to them.

Demand outpacing supply, sure it does. That's why they keep building permits scarce together with easing finance this directly leads back to the banks with their fractional banking giving you all the credit to finance that overpriced house now the economy is booming.
higher costs of materials, might be, but raw materials in general are not really in a bull market right now. They have had some though years.
higher wages, i think this one is visa versa, you get a higher wage to make up for the inflation (some contracts/ unions are even directly linked with inflation).
@_date: 2018-10-02 08:17:34
Check regulations if it is allowed in your jurisdiction to take bitcoin as cash.
Ask if the house seller is okay with that (assuming you could arrange it neatly), maybe the seller wants even to keep some bitcoin.
If the seller wants to cash in all bitcoin make sure you get the price locked. By buyers agreement, buying some futures, hedging in other way, directly sell them through some service/exchange.
As a realtor i would try to make it happen, show the seller that you are experienced in this, its a nice free advertisement and some new feature you can apply.

But that's the difference as an insurance normally has to pay out only xx percentage. Even in massive regional catastrophes they can pay (although it can/would hurt there business majorly). That's why insurances re-insure their business sometimes so it ends up being really globally.
But a bank "insurance" can't even pay up if one bank fails. And the problem with this current system is that the likelihood that everything at the same time is going to shit is pretty high as we have seen in the last financial crisis.

In general you should never lent or borrow a strong money/currency.
If you live in Africa you want to borrow in a shit fiat and save in usd. You don't want to borrow in USD (supposedly for less interest) and safe in a shit currency which will inflate away.
One way USA is so great is because they tell the world their currency is like gold and meanwhile they print away and put the inflation on the rest of the world.
If you want to look more into this debt problem from strong and weak currencies i would recommend to look into developing countries debts who often lend in eur/usd and get in major problems in just a few years time.

Yes so it is not really real.
As normally an insurance would be able to cover its promises, that's kind of the idea of a real insurance. So its just an idea invented to let everyone think that everything is okay as we make sure (whatever we have to do to get there) that you get your money back.
It's like having a fire insurance but when there is a real fire everyone in society just have to chip in two pennies anyway.
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:54:50
Setup your own node.
Run a LN node.
If your country doesn't allow transactions (block fiat bank gateway), start to trade p2p. Setup p2p networks, meetings, whatever idea you have to trade without governments support/knowledge.
Bitcoin might be blocked in one county but in many countries it is not likely, so the system stays reliable.
If you have cheap energy, mine it!

What's the threat?
If he doesn't sell nothing changes as that is what the market priced in and everyone expects. 
If he sells the coins come into circulation and the price might (will) drop for a while as there is a bigger supply than the market is used to.
Nothing horrible in both cases.
@_date: 2018-10-22 14:00:54
But you really blame the wrong party. Exchanges just don't accept credit cards in general for perfect good reasons. BTW you can buy bitcoin in gbp now on Coinbase no? At least i see it in my account.
I didn't know UK has no good exchange, i live in a country like 1/5 th of uk and we have multiple exchanges. Besides all the easy access to major exchanges.
So yea your problem is pretty valid haha. Instead of seeing it as a problem i think you need to setup an exchange in the UK then, seems like there is a good opportunity :)

I was referring to fiat currency. Those have no market cap as lending and printing money does increase the supply (sometimes a lot).
Bitcoin can be used as a currency but it is not the sole practical use. For example USD only can be used as currency, otherwise it is nothing more than a piece of paper with a picture and no value at all. Gold for example can be used as a currency (not really convenient for obvious reasons) but also for jewelry or super conductor in electronics. 
But yes there might be a direct correlation, i do think that the bigger bitcoin's price (so also market cap) the more thrust it receives in the end. Look how bitcoin was below 1$ billion in total and no one cared about it. Everyone thought it would "die". But now we are at 100$ Billion and businesses get interested, financial market got shocked by its performance, banks become a little afraid of it and speculative financial products are being built on top of it right now.
Whereas a company growing larger it becomes harder to get more value. Amazon getting from 100$ Billion to 1 Trillion was much easier then reaching 10 Trillion. But for example bitcoin might get into the trillions of value one day and people start to use it more and more as a store of value. The creditworthiness only increases. It might even one day be so valuable and stable that it will be used as main currency.

Anyway i think bitcoin has more upside than gold or silver. Those metals will be suppressed by someone at least in the next crisis regardless of future mining capacities. While at this moment they would have a hard time putting downward pressure on bitcoin. 
Maybe in the near future with "paper" bitcoin, but that is still to be seen.

Segwit adoption is steady, now at 60+% out of my head. LN works pretty well, i would advise you to test it out. You can download an app and open a channel easily. I think coingate is at the moment furthest with the adoption. They offer LN transactions for all their clients as a payment processor. I have used LN once from them months ago and it worked well. This was a ~$70 transaction, so that was pretty cool. :)

I think your logic might be a bit flawed. Although you and i may see bitcoin as a safe heaven. Most of the big money will certainly not see it that way.
Besides bitcoin is still a speculative asset and if the stockmarket crashes bitcoin will too. In a financial crisis liquidity is scarce, so everyone wants to have the major fiat currencies. "Cash is king", it really is! Too many people have been playing the bitcoin market with borrowed money and will close down those positions. 
Even gold took a hit in the last financial crisis before starting to rise, keep in mind that such thing is likely for bitcoin too. Bitcoin can come out much stronger though.

Most people i know are just to lazy to withdrawal their money at an ATM and pay with cash (although often they prefer it as it give them more sense to money).
They just use their debit card because its the way of least resistance. And the government/banks know that perfectly and play on that idea.
In my country debit cards are wide spread and credit cards are less spread (it cost extra and merchants are not happily accepting them). So do people choose to pay with credit card and having those guarantees? No almost all payment traffic is done by debit card. And for sure if there would be xxxx card which give you 1% discount people will just jump on that option like hungry lions.

That depends on where you live, better search on some local websites or your tax website.

Not necessarily. If the price of bitcoin doubles the reward in fiat stays the same. If new machines (for the same price) could mine double the amount of bitcoin it stays the same. If electricity gets cheaper they could have the same return. If i mine at 100% profit i might also just be fine with 50% and keep mining. Eventually miners keep outbidding each other till there is no money to be made.


As far as i understand it, batching safes space. Basically you pay not per transaction but per amount of space in the blockchain. And if a batched transaction takes less space you pay less per tx. But to really understand that you have to look for yourself about it, i'm not really sure about how it exactly works out.


LN has some limitations and uncertainties too. But it isn't true that that is the only solution. They want more to improve the blockchain so that it keeps small. LN is one option, but they also try to scale the first chain. For now LN could be used more for small transactions. 0.000001 - 25$ let say (that is most optimal usecase), but maybe later it would be different. My highest LN transaction so far is ~70$ and it went actually smoothly. (Buying something from a merchant who uses coingate and their LN).


It is a long way, think about the payment history of this time period. From silver and gold coins we went to diluted coins. To metal coins without anything valuable in it. Paper money&gt;cheques&gt;bank transactions&gt; debit/creditcards&gt; Internet banking &gt; Paypal/transferwise &gt; Mobile app banking &gt; Mobile nfc payments &gt;bitcoin/blockchain.
Just paying that one dollar in the last 100 years have pretty much been evolutionized in ways we couldn't imagine.
I don't see bitcoin as the best/cheapest/fastest payment system. But it is much harder to track your payments, no one can't stop a payment or control the value in the address. No one can stop me for supporting Wikileaks. It works 24/7/365 and can't be reversed. And a person who needs to keep his wealth from bad parties can do it and take his seed to wherever he wants. That are way more important facts than paying cheaply and instantly. A $100 dollar fee to store your wealth very securely or transport it across any border around the globe is still a bargain.

Yea the 4 bill might not be that accurate. But even if you take the low 10k btc (in my eyes it's pretty unlikely). But many markets work in the same way. But in bitcoin it is very predictable, so it is less likely that people suddenly react differently on the actual fact. As it is basically already priced in (at least in theory). The point is that a healthy market with real supply and demand should not feel this change at all. Let say bitcoin does feel this very much it means that the supply/demand is very out of order.
I think i once read how Warren Buffett in his earlier years bought 10-25% of the daily supply of a stock for months (to get his stake in a company without trying to offset the market).

If you don't pay for advertisements such outlets are going to write you negative things. But the longer bitcoin will be around the more ridiculous their stories become.

If bitcoin doesn't work, the whole concept would be bad no? That there are now other crypto coins in circulation has more to do with the idea that bitcoin works and has value then other way around. Without bitcoin having value i see very very negative results for those other coins.

Sending money from/to USA/EU is a nightmare. I would definitely chose for bitcoin if i were you!
I think if you withdrawal that money in one time you could run into filing some documents about how you got this money. 
Maybe you can even just use coinbase for both actions. Wire it from US account and withdrawal it on a new German bank account with sepa transaction. Or buy in Coinbase, setup on an exchange like bitstamp with new details only (german adress/ bank etc), and withdrawal that way.
In Germany there is a pretty big website called bitcoin.de  for trading too.

Fiat currencies is based on trust, same for bitcoin. So taking into account the history my bet is that bitcoin will win that trust fight in the next 50 years.

Watch grant cardone, robert kiyosaki, andreas antonopoulos or tim ferris.
Building a house from real assets and renting it is the same indeed as lending a person 200k based on nothing more than a piece of paper with credit invented out of thin air. While you need to deliver hard labor in return to pay back that 200k over a 30 years period. Even renting companies could lent money to build more houses and keep the debt system going on.
Renting or property ownership shouldn't be so different priced as otherwise everyone would/should buy/rent so in a free market is should be close to the same.
Also it depends very much on your ROI. Let say you pay a bit less in rent than for the equity for 30 years. Meanwhile your ROI is hitting double digits and you can end up with much more assets after 30 years.

Nothing wrong with asking a question.
But pointing someone out as a fraud while you don't have a clue about the situation is rather silly.
@_date: 2018-10-26 08:49:27
Yea very likely.
I think there are two main categories imo. The people who bought/mined in the early stages, those have many bitcoins and are both in fiat and bitcoin standards very rich by now. Some sold or trying to sell, while others hold and keep there whole stack. Hard to say how many such people are out there but likely enough.
Than you have many people who came later in around 2016-2018 and those people most likely have &lt;10 BTC. As for most people around the world that is already a decent amount of fiat you have to put in. Let say they bought at 1k$ it is still 10k$+ initial investment, not that many people can/would throw that in i guess.
I think that is a big group of people, looking around at forums, around me and also on stats like from localbitcoin.com were people in Turkey, Ukraine, Argentina and the like are buying bitcoin. They most likely own not really many, but it has for them a big impact.
If you look at the kind of people who are into bitcoin it is mainly Younger then 30 and 35 in some broader sense. But this are in general people with not that much money to begin with. The current capital in the west sits mostly among the baby boomers generation. People who don't see the need for another system as the current system did them well.

IV for bitcoin is a bit of a non argument i think. Although i like IV in many things like stocks for example. I buy bitcoin for whole other reasons. That's why Warren Buffett will not like bitcoin and doesn't like gold. It has zero or low IV. Humans in a social setting gives it its value. We value fiat because we think it is worth what we think at that moment. Gold is like a fundamental brick while governments want it to increase little against fiat as they want people to use/hold fiat and not gold. Gold holders want to see it increase against fiat as in that way they make a profit.
I really doubt bitcoin will not find a place in here as well. No it will not replace fiat across the whole world (at least for the foreseeable future). It will also not replace gold. But it will be an extra and new asset class. A new way to do payments, like credit cards were new one day and paypal and online debit payment systems.
But more importantly a new way to hedge against gold/fiat/government/stocks. One which is very secure, hard to confiscate, durable and has scarce economics build into it.

Listen if you want to be against USDt fine by me. Don't use it. Don't use exchanges with USDt gateways. Don't use any exchanges somehow connected (there are more than you might think). Everything it fine and you will not be hurt by it exploding to zero.
But don't come with stupid arguments and be ignorant to what the market clearly uses and needs.

I think you might see/use hot storage like a checking account and cold storage like a savings accounts.
For savings purpose you don't even need to login into your savings account, you could just wire it directly from your checking (same as for bitcoin).
So for bitcoin you might not use for a long time it is best practice to find a very secure way to store it. While doing some daily (low value) transactions a hot wallet on your desktop/mobile, might be sufficient.
@_date: 2018-10-09 19:22:44


Hold on there boy, don't be so emotional. Because some miners want to leave a ~$500 in tx fees you want to change the whole system? They can attack bitcoin but they can't win. Other miners will gratefully reap in the extra work. Just reserve some more time for your transactions and let them play.

Why a CEO of a major company is selling his (ridiculous) stock bonuses right away?
I mean, they asked for stock to get a "stake" in the business too right? They have already a good salary and really do believe in the company they work for (the future they are building themselves).
FYI: That is kind of the idea of free markets and a market price no? To find a equilibrium between demand and supply.

I think it might in some way. Gold will always have it's store of value aspect, even when bitcoin will be majorly successful. It's like an indestructible insurance policy.
But i do think that bitcoin might surpass gold's value one day. Bitcoins technology is much wider usable as gold. Bitcoin can be seen as gold (actually the economics behind it are even better for bitcoin, its more rare!).
Bitcoin has so much more to offer than gold, its not really even competition. I feel like bitcoin is what is Amazon to a book store.

Amazon investments neither. As stock are already given out so what you pay now will not really increase the business if they don't give out extra stock (water it down/ inflate it).
I meant not financial products based on something. Although that might be very profitable, but it most likely hurt the clients who they sell it at. I meant the real product. Same as the real gold owners are king, not the people who temporarily have a successful business on selling gold like products based on air.
Of course it hypothetical as no one knows the future, few could see 20 years ago where internet has come today. Whole businesses and even industries have been ruined by lack of vision.

@_date: 2018-10-24 19:25:04
In a total different way but i would say yes. Money/currency/store of value evolves over the years. Bitcoin could be seen as a new phase.
If you put it on a timeline with means of payments it really looks like a new innovation.
Although it is still early. For store of value it better has to weather the first global financial crisis first to see how it respond to that. Until now it has been good, but in a rising market anyone looks smart.
For international transactions it is very useful and competitive. Without restriction and at very low cost sending money within a day would beat any other current option i guess.
Paying locally your bread and other groceries not so much yet. For that it is too slow, has too high fees, too complicated. But bitcoin isn't an out of the box finished product, it can be improved and future innovations (LN for example) could start to compete with any form of payments.
So yes it is very innovative. In many ways (more than i addressed here though, think also about privacy, securely, without restriction/control).
@_date: 2018-10-19 07:44:09

Look here:
According to this source there is 99 : 1 paper to gold ratio.
This means that for every ounce of real gold (a coin you can hold or store somewhere) there are 99 ounces of made up paper gold. In investment account or where-ever they could sell that crap.
Same will be for bitcoin if you let them. First they allow physical backed ETFs. So an ETF is buying real bitcoin for what it is supposed to have. Than you have those ETF's who don't buy real bitcoin buy just some "paper bitcoin". They already applied btw.
And before you know it Goldman Sachs is selling "bitcoin" to its clients but it doesn't look like bitcoin at all anymore.

Not only companies. Add mortgages, personal debts, student debts, government debts. Banks in general would have an extreme hard time in a long deflationary period.
I think business can do fairly well in a deflationary economy as well. Business can adapt pretty easily. Maybe not the high debt businesses but they have a difficult time even with inflation as a sudden rise in interest might bankrupt them in a split second too.

@_date: 2018-10-19 22:09:31
Bull crap.
Come with some evidence that this is the reality.
Very nice to look at addresses on the blockchain but this doesn't tell much. There might be one address with 20.000 BTC owned by a million people (exchange). Or one guy with 20.000 BTC spread over 200.000 addresses (only showing his max holding of .1 BTC).
Another example is Coinbase makes new addresses for every transaction while another exchange may use the same address over and over again. So if his holdings come in daily on CB it looks very spread while if they come in on the other exchange the holdings add up quickly. Same person, same bitcoin, same holdings, same blockchain, yet a very different outcome in the data..

Yes it would go largely unnoticed and that is the idea of OTC markets. 
The idea of OTC markets is that big transactions are be done at own terms.
Lets for example take Satoshis 1mil bitcoin. It is 6% of the total supply. It would be horrendous if this would be sold in the open market. If there is a big party who likes bitcoin they can buy up the whole stake (at around market price but it could be different and they might have different reasons to buy/sell. So it can be at discount or premium).
But then a new party would own 6% and the old one is gone (nothing really wrong for the market in general). This would be preferable to open market transactions.
You talk about price go up faster, but the need for selling might be higher then the buyer, so then the price would go down. Because let say the buyer only wants that 6% as the price is $5k. So he will just wait for it to be $5k or not buy at all.
Different situations has different outcomes of course. And some OTC market will anyway influence the price. Someone might operate in OTC market and buy/sell in open market (arbitrage).

Bitcoin could do that overtime (maybe), but we are talking decades here, the USD or EUR isn't going to fall quickly of course. But slowly bitcoin will eat its value like a big black hole.
And the more value it eats away the better it becomes while the fiat's become looking like an awful bad invention.

That's basically the idea. If for example Japan discloses that it would hold 1mil btc, the price will sky rocket. People/governments/banks will fall over each other to get a share as well. But there aren't that many bitcoin to begin with, so price can go as high as it needs to settle it.
Why Japan would hold bitcoin while they can buy everything they want? If they reach the endgame they can start to spent it and live like kings. Like how any kingdom waste their resources eventually.

That's not the idea of a stablecoin to fight that is it? It is just like a dollar in a bank account. It gets hit with the same purchasing power. Stablecoins are just their for exchanges without fiat and to inter exchange transactions.

I don't really like tether/bitfinex but i think its useful. The volume of T is always high so it seems that it is used a lot for arbitrage trading. While it might be done without T, i think you get a better bitcoin price across the exchanges with it.
But i can live easily without it. Arbitrage will be done anyway. They don't pump the market although many people think they are. If it implodes it might set off bitcoin (in any direction) but in the end it doesn't really matter, business will be as usual.

Seems silly of him to make such bets while it wasn't that much of a hassle to make a payment by using Coingate.
Good you showed how awesome LN is and you did forgive his debts in the end.
Now i am thinking of something, make him wear a LN tshirt like Roger Ver will need to do very soon too. It would be funny to see all those people loosing similar bets over LN/Coingate.

Yes and what would happen if there is more fiat?
The money/debt quadrupled in ten years. They can keep doing that forever as they do it out of thin air. But what you think will happen to assets with a finite supply?
Or from a whole other angle. Let say your vision is correct, but suddenly China both central bank and normal banks start to hoard bitcoin as they see it as the future and a hedge against their failing USD investments. What would happen then? Bitcoin would stay flat? Really?

Only if the miners have a real real small impact on the supply.
Most coins are in circulation and only a few are added daily (especially after the next halving). The price is set by trading the available supply not (anymore) by the mining supply.
Although humans are funny creatures, so probably it will have effect as most people have exactly the idea/feeling like you.

Yea that what i was thinking, be sure it is all good. Be the first to receive the bitcoin on your own address before you sent anything (money/product/whatever).
There are many scams so be very careful (paranoia would be helpful)! When it sounds to good to be true it probably is.
@_date: 2018-10-26 16:06:35
Yes true. But a revolution aint bad, it shift out the good from the bad. Competition is good. Real capitalist (countries) shouldn't be against it. But with countries like Switzerland and Malta supporting it aint going away anymore. Likely more countries will follow soon.
I have seen now a couple of exchanges going from mainland EU to Malta, as other countries oppress those exchanges. Those exchanges are not coming back so basically they give away market share in a new profitable industry.
@_date: 2018-10-10 08:58:15

Lol, stop smoking.
@_date: 2018-10-24 08:26:10
No its not. Production cost rarely ever really sets the price. Definitely not in bitcoin.
The 17 million coins out here set the price in open market conditions. Those 17 million coins don't care about electricity cost, mining cost, profit/loss for a miner.
For example if miners mine bitcoin at $5000 on average. But suddenly we all agree that bitcoin is actually is worth for us only $2500. Than the market price undoubtedly go to $2500. Sure they may stop mining (bitcoin protocol will keep spitting out same supply regardless). Sure they may keep the coins and not sell it anymore. They may even start buying too. But that will not bring the price up to $5k by itself.
@_date: 2018-10-22 09:03:39
That's why most people stay wage slaves for the rest of their lives.
@_date: 2018-10-31 09:00:06
Yes, so you wasted $80 and missed out on another $5000 opportunity but now safely have $5k instead of a easy $10k which was also pretty safe to begin with.
Not very clever is it?

#  Don't lose money.
So basically don't invest in alt coins, the chances you will lose sooner or later are very high!
Yes you could buy and hold (but be aware that price may go down further and many times people sell at lower prices, ask one of those thousands of people who bought in the end of last year and sold somewhere in this year)..
Dollar cost average is a way to buy and have an average price. Read into this kind of trading a bit.
To better understand what is going on i recommend you to read the book "the bitcoin standard".
@_date: 2018-10-06 10:08:43
Looks more like you can get a discount, lol


@_date: 2018-10-17 07:56:39
One of the big exchanges is fine. Check if they are available in your country. It depends much on if they accept customers from your country and that you could send fiat money easily to an exchange. 
A local nation exchange might also work.
Some examples:
Bitstamp, Coinbase, Kraken.
@_date: 2018-10-22 09:47:41
Not true. It is fairly easy even. You just need patience and willpower. 
But the majority of people will not and still think in their 40's and 50's that investing is risky. While if they did so they could easily be financially free at that time. So that is the real cost of not investing in time.
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:59:22
Luckily people now for the first time in ages have a choice. Once the next financial crisis hits it will be showtime!
@_date: 2018-10-02 16:07:52
Almost no one switches anyway. Look at the price, the market is telling you a different story.
If you don't believe yet so much in bitcoin i can recommend you to read "the bitcoin standard".
Bitmain is holding a bag of more than a million bcash, and one day in the near future they will likely need/want to unload that. That will put serious selling pressure at the market price. Bitmain is even lying in the books about the value of that coin. They keep it in the books at the price of purchase but meanwhile it became worth way less (but they can't really sell that amount of bcash as it would kill the market and make their holdings worthless).
@_date: 2018-10-23 07:37:25
Lol, yea for sure. Even if Satoshi dumps his one million bitcoin it will just temporarily set back the price. Cornering a market is very though and very rarely really succeed. 
If you followed any bitcoin progress you would see that it is not very likely. But just stay away from it man if it is too early and scary for you.
It's normal human thought procession to be scared of something new, it happened by millions of people over the years.
@_date: 2018-10-27 09:42:06
How you received the bitcoin though?
Are they safe in a wallet you created? That would be my first concern. You can exchange them how you want, if it is a legit deal you can use exchanges like kraken, bitstamp or coinbase. But you need verification for that. You could also store the bitcoin and keep the bitcoin for later, if so i would recommend the book: "the bitcoin standard". To get a better idea of the whole concept.
@_date: 2018-10-30 15:02:51


Yea, businesses with small margins often present a higher price if you pay through paypal or cc. If they don't do that they not really offer the cheapest options to their clients.

Dollar cost average over a long time and it will not matter that much. You probably made some investment rookie mistakes :p
@_date: 2018-10-10 12:57:45
It's because there is no other way.
Some debts they are buying is because no one else in their right mind would ever buy them. The interest would sky rocket in no time and then the risk will spread in no time.
So they rather spent everyone's money and keep the shit show going on a bit longer.

Your post almost looks like you are under extortion, better then visit a nearby police station.
Buying limits are there for a reason, not much CB can do about that. You have to wait that long because your banks suck. They don't send the money in time. Whenever i wire a EUR deposit with SEPA it is there in 3-4 hours or maximum a full day. From the moment it arrives i can make a purchase and send the bitcoin.

Aaah you do know the economics story of inflation people told you over and over again, that's great.
You understand that many things are tight to inflation right? For example pensions, unemployment and other government expenses. If year after year the real inflation is lower than the official one the system would already fail. You really think government will overspent money on such things while coming up with the numbers themselves?
@_date: 2018-10-29 16:45:36


You can use bitcoin in payment and storing Like gold/fiat but they can't really take it from you. It's a hundred fault easier to story bitcoin and run to another country if needed than to do with gold/fiat. Just one idea on top of my head though.


Imo it can be compared to gold.


In that way gold is no store of value anymore? I think i would have a hard time exchanging a gold bar or even just a coin.


Not sure that is intrinsic value, although as IV is broad/vague you might use it for that. I would say like Warren Buffett says that this network effect is like the moat around the castle. You can see in companies like Booking.com, Youtube or Facebook that network effect is very valuable.
@_date: 2018-10-30 14:43:58

Wire the money first.
Your bank is sending the money slowly so they hold until the money gets through (payment settlement).
Send for example with SEPA and the money arrives in 2-4 hours after that you can buy and send directly.

Currently it is not that cheap, but on the other side we could go x80 to reach gold mcap. And its possible that bitcoin becomes more valuable than that although gold has been around for centuries.

So basically gold fell a 25% in 2008 and then started to recover in October. While stocks were at that moment were also down a lot and fell for another 6 months to recover in 2009 until this year they were in a bull.
So yes you would have done okay with gold and stocks. If you timed well you would have benefit more from switching to gold and then back to stocks. But that is what almost no one could do perfect and the chances you lost more opportunity cost at the rising stock market is pretty decent.
Cash was king in last crisis as although we might think though but i didn't go away. So just going out of stocks, long in dollar and back in stocks was good. But timing is always hard and few can do it. That why dollar cost average in a basket of assets is most likely to perform much better into the long run. 
% real estate (earning, not your home its not an asset)
% stocks
% bonds (although that market is fucked up big time by low interest rates due to massive manipulation of central banks).
% gold-silver
% bitcoin (i would say as someone who likes bitcoin, but its still early for that).

Bitcoin in my opinion will going to play big role in the next century of global finance. The shit governments and (central) banks have been doing is on it's end. 
Slowly people will convert their wealth into bitcoin, and guess what? It's not going down to zero so it will go up one day or another. Slowly but surely it will go higher and higher. (The higher it goes the more trust/value it obtains).

For POS it works not really great indeed. A company could use 0-conf if it has small amounts. At least they could test it and see how it actually works out. For example a restaurant, of course a customer could double spent the bitcoin and scam the restaurant. But then why go through the hassle of paying with bitcoin while you often also just can walk away..
LN might work better for small transactions, it has a near instant final transaction and the fees are low.
@_date: 2018-10-19 09:07:19
Does your purchase of a coke or a coffee really need to be validated every time through the most secure network? Does it need to be embedded every such transaction in the ledger?
LN looks promossing, i just opened a channel some months ago and did some small purchases with it. Just played around with it and even did 1 satoshi transactions. So both layers might be a better solution to serve both worlds. Free or almost free low value transactions (almost instantly) and high secure transactions for a bit higher fee as normal settlement were 6-conf isn't a problem.

I tried to check the dutch website but it's so slow and inconvenient that i gave up half way there.
@_date: 2018-10-10 08:56:28
Because then they agree that the system has value. They kept kind of ignoring it as they hoped it magically disappeared. I think like most of us they just undervalued it and most still do today.
The point is when a (central) bank starts to buy bitcoin the "real" game begins. As no one wants to be left out. Then you will start to see a bull run like never before. But i doubt any such institution touched bitcoin. Some might have tried it but hardly any have put substantial money into it thus far.

I doubt, most often its very hard to distinct the real thing something which is created out of thin air.

Correct. But the early investors of Amazon also didn't think it would disrupt the whole retail market. They didn't care much neither, they made massive profits on speculation. Speculators also bring value, they take something and bring it to the next level.


In the end i see almost no other way than it would take the majority of commerce, the USD is on its end of a life time and there will have to be a new world currency put in place. The problem is no one really wants that position and not many currencies would be ready for it. The EUR will not be it and China wouldn't want that role and would like to keep the underdog currency for as long as possible.
But the trust in the USD is declining fast, so one or two crises later it really is over for the dollar. Same as Gulden, Real or Pound left that position.
I do see a future were bitcoin will gain massive attraction by real powerful parties. Now we are still in very early stages. What do you think will happen when banks or even central banks start to buy bitcoin. Just like they buy gold. They all tell fiat is the real currency but they know better. They don't like nor trust the fiat currencies of the other parties. What if Russia or Iran start to buy bitcoin and hedge against the dollar. Bitcoin by now is unlikely to go away, so one day or another a (central) bank undoubtedly start to buy bitcoins. And from that moment on i think it will go fast and it will take long before this will be replaced (if at all).

It's a 100$ investment in bitcoin (or other) on Coinbase right?

I don't know enough about USA to make such statement. I do know that the world is not ready for one and only one currency by a long shot. Yes it's more convenient and i understand your reasoning. I do make/loose money big time just by difference in usd/eur exchange rate. The thing is that it just doesn't work at the current state of the world. 
For example
Southern Europe will drag the EU in the abyss if they don't come up with a good plan pretty soon. We had economist saying in the 90's that the Euro will not work with the difference between North and South, but hey what did they know. Politicians put through anyway (in their demand for more power and influence) and now there is trillions at stake for people...

Buy when blood is in the streets.
Although it looks hard, the times to buy is when no one wants to buy and think you are stupid. The time to sell is when everyone talks about it and is amazed.
Although it is well known and written in different ways thousands of times, still our little human brain plays tricks with it in every bubble or bust.

@_date: 2018-06-28 09:57:32
Exactly, thinking BTC is a bubble like those from the past while it is still worth only 100b. It is not more than a small needle in a world full of bubbles.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:07:15
Wait till your country or bank decided that you can't access YOUR money. Or even worse, wait till they decide that you may take a haircut because the system is about to collapse and they can use YOUR money for settling the new bank. (Proof is already given in the EU that this will likely happen on a bigger scale very soon).
@_date: 2018-06-15 20:29:56
But with such value you don't really have to know the exact amount of BTC? As such value (i agree it is a value) is not a fixed price. More likely a very rough estimated price range. Such price also includes events, when bad things happens the price of gold rises but after the storm the price get back down to a more accepted level.
If you value it based on utility the volatility is a bit of a problem. Not in all cases but in general something stable is more convenient for most utility functions.

Yes, they made a good amount of money on it.
The exchange rate is/was aprox 0.97  So if they buy back 100 mil USDT they have to pay out only $97 Million at the moment (as the market still prices it lower). So by burning this 500M they made ~15M US dollar.

I think if they talk about discount (or premium) in OTC markets that means the difference between their deal and the market price. So i 5% discount would mean they settled for a price 5% lower than currently at the open market.

If you trowed in 50 pound a couple of years ago you now would own a full Bitcoin. So even small amounts can be wise to put into it. That's the beauty, it doesn't cost much to participate. Dollar averaging is a good way to pay a reasonable price, no one can predict the bottom anyway. And look how pensions are made, just by small regular amounts every month again and again.

Don't wast money on those other coins out there though, that would really going to hurt your finances later on.
Buy the book "the bitcoin standard".
An investment can always turn against you, try to understand why you invested in the first place. If it was because you were buying because of greed and not really solid reasons you probably made a mistake. You lost the money regardless now. Look at the investment and try to see it as a new investment, are you want to get in now? Do you see any future for it? Prices on the short term can be heavily against you, that doesn't make it a bad investment. Some investors double down on it if they are sure and come out with much bigger gains.
Market moves in cycles and prices change every day. That's how the free market game works. If you bought without good reasons at 11k and now want to sell without good reasons at 6k you might want to overthink what you are doing and don't waste your money in such adventures. Just put it in a savings account and keep yourself from wasting the money.

I think you need to look at it differently. Deflationary assets gets also spent in the end no? People who hodled their BTC eventually sold the coins to consume anyway. People who invested in their pension (stock assets who rise in value) also get sold because people want to live as well. Same goes for inflationary assets, i live in a country with a mild inflation as it was since ages with a stable currency. But why than people save money in this currency? It is actually common practice here and even our government supports it. But if what you say is correct, that money should be consumed.
The thing is money gets used anyway, people like to eat and live. They pay with deflationary/inflationary money regardless. It's a trick that they use to make anyone think that inflation is needed.

I also do see it this way. But i really dont see why you think you can not spent it. The less volatile the more reasons to change your monthly pay as it comes in and uses throughout the month BTC payments. If the price is stable enough this can be possible. Any money left after the month can appreciate in value, so you have more to spent in the next month.

Went for camping and found a camping which accepted BTC, so i wanted to book that one but it was full already. Did find another campsite and went there. They had no BTC payment option and funny enough there POS system crashed two days ago (would this have happened at the Bitcoin camping too?).
So luckily enough we had some cash, otherwise we needed to go and search for an atm in the hunt for some hard earned money which is not available for spending.

I do think Bitcoin can be in a bubble (like in December '17). So the price rises faster than the "real value" at that time. But now we come back to a more realistic value for this time. 
So i think there are bubbles but not a bubble which makes bitcoin valueless of course.

Everyone should need it as any bank/government can and ultimately will use those possibilities one day. If you don't believe me check the Cyprus/ Greece cases. (And in the history it happened much more, but those are in particular interesting as they at least for the EU zone changed the banking rules and those were kind of test cases).
But if you trust your government/currency/bankers completely, just keep it "safely" in the bank.

Money in my bank looses on average 3.5% a year (~1.5 a year on tax and a targeted 2% for inflation). It doesn't keep people from putting billions into the bank accounts either and leave it there "to save money". At the moment it amounts to €340 Billion just for my country alone. A quick calculation tells me that this year alone 12€ Billion will be "stolen" from those accounts. But keep your money "save" in a non volatile asset people!

I think you don't really understand what volatility is, before BTC was also very volatile. I think you mistake percentage difference with the price difference in USD. And anyway it is a wrong conclusion. If there is more adoption and a much higher price (lets say 100x) the volatility would be much less most likely. 
"People like to trust their earnings with something that's familiar and easy to deal with and fractions of bitcoins doesn't do it. "
Execactly that's why there is so much inflation and people still stick with their euro and dollars. But it also shows that whatever happens as long as Bitcoins delivers people will trust it, and the more people trust it the more valuable the system will become.

I do get your point, but we are very far from this stage. Looking far into the future it would be still better to make get a loan in a inflating fiat currency. But if we will get ever to this stage Bitcoin will be more stable, but for this we need to grow more than we have seen so far. A 100B market is too small for this. Even in the small country where i live in there is about 3.5x the BTC marketcap just sitting idle in fiat bank accounts.

You know that those exchanges often don't take coins no? So that is normally already a big chunk of your left over money. This machine isn't used for sentiment value, but for dumping the worthless fiat. I would bet that there are much more people with 50 euro left that you could imagine.

@_date: 2018-06-16 13:17:03
That is true. I agree with you. Although i am not sure about the big price manipulation. I think just a lot of people bought BTC for a quick return and are now selling to not loose more money.
And to be honest i don't even think this is a bad thing, this dump i bought more than i would have with higher prices and i will Hodl for many years. So more coins are now once again getting out of circulation and put aside for the next bull run.

The problem is that they basically not have succeeded in fighting the problems and getting inflation going.
Instead they created an asset bubble (rising stock/RE prices). But the economy never really started to grow big time. But now we have an even worse situation then we had in 2008. 
The next crisis will hit even harder (because that easily printed money will hit back roughly) and the new measurements will have less effect, so they will even have to try crazier things than before. And now there is suddenly a small risk that instead of a small (wanted) inflation the dollar/euro or any other big currencies directly go into hyperinflation as everybody just opts out of it (not super likely, i know) and choices bitcoin for example. I know this isn't very likely (yet), but their is such chance.
Now many people still hate it, but do they still when it is $100k per coin? Or $350k and/or surpassed gold? Bitcoin isn't going away and as long as it doesn't go away it slowly swallows up more people who understand it.

I don't know enough about the FDIC and frankly enough i don't care. If you trust those insurances go ahead, i don't mind.
But ask yourself this, if the system collapses, how on earth those "insurances" can cover the money that was lost? You do understand that in a financial collapse always all parties and once start to have problems and it doesn't even have to come from your country, it can start in rural China. Is FDIC going to protect you from that?  If so, why there were bail outs needed?
Sure last 10 years there was no problem, bitcoin also didn't have any problems for the last 10 years. It kept spitting block after block. We tent to look a bit further than that aren't we? My stocks also went up for the last (almost) 10 years, it doesn't make me think it is 100% secure by now.

No one really knows this for sure. Bitcoin wasn't been there in any other financial crisis so it is very hard to say.
Last time gold started to crash in the crisis as well before rising quickly to an all time high. This was due to traders getting out of gold (liquidating those trades or just getting margin calls, etc). But to be honest i start to think that this will not happen to gold this time as it seemed to be started a bull run already (people/central banks getting already into gold for safety).
Bitcoin might go as gold did. When the crisis hits bitcoin drops sharply by traders who are seeking for USD or other fiat. But this only counts for short term selling pressure and soon the people start to fly out of fiat and into bitcoin.
But who knows really what happens, interesting it will be for sure to watch it closely! Besides, do understand that bitcoin just keeps going every ten minutes by creating a new block, there is no one who can stop this. Banks will get into problems (again), people might lose access to their bank, limited withdrawal at an ATM (50$ a day for example), or even crazier measurements this time to "beat" the crisis. Meanwhile bitcoin will just keep working fine, i'm sure that will make an impression on some people!

What does it matter why i want to sent money to Norway? It isn't overseas either, just like in America to another state. For Europe it is another country but supposed to be as easy. So you propose that no one shouldn't be able to send $100 at all? You do understand in what age we live in right?


You understand that exchange rate differences isn't a problem right? But it isn't a perfect money yet indeed, i never claimed it is better for general commerce already, but it will get there in the next decades. Short term a fiat currency (at least the most) are very stable, long term those are a hot coal you rather do not touch.


I do travel and i do understand that for 99%+ of the people will not have this problem. But it is still a feature in which you can use bitcoin. Millions of people live in not so good conditions and do have this problem. (I know one personally). Not all banks/countries are good, so you can't trust them. Do you disagree with this?


Yea those exist purely because of bitcoin. Just ban bitcoin and we live in a wonderful dream land! 








It is just one example as u don't see any implementation. Go read and search for others as you would like. Did you ever live in a country with 25+% inflation? I did, those people get slaughtered without something most people could do anything against it. Many banks were failing and people lost money through that. House robberies increased as people start to hold cash. They are not even allowed to take money out to a foreign country and eur/usd was sold for extreme premium rates. That wasn't in Venezuela, there are many not so perfect countries outside the western world.

I think it is not a total tech play. Many people are into bitcoin because of its economic rules (me included). That is a major breakthrough in human history.
Combine this with the security, the network effect, the tech etc. 
And you have something so unique that can only been played out ones. Would i bet that the next bitcoin wouldn't be past by the next-next bitcoin? No i wouldn't from the moment that bitcoin is defeated by just the next best i would not put any such trust into the next coin anymore.
Gold is valuable because we think it stays valuable, if we switch every few decades/centuries over to the next big best SoV metal we wouldn't put much value in it in the first place.
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:04:36
Most people actually don't own the house as they have a gigantic mortgage on the house. 
The most value is not in the house but in the ground, and as the government has a monopoly on giving building permits they control the supply. So they can make the market very scarce creating an increased housing price which in turn is good for the banks who gave out the mortgages and holding already billions in mortgages. 
But if your house on paper increases doesn't really mean much, as you need to live somewhere so your price to buy another house or too rent also increases, only if you move to another country you can really profit from it, but that is a few who actually do that. Most simply have to pay up.
So banks and governments profit the most from this housing scheme and thirdly high net worth individuals.

Did you read "the bitcoin standard"?
10% Isn't that much, it might be a pretty reasonable diversification, it depends on your other holdings. And you say that your a college kid, so it depends in which time frame you need the money. Maybe you don't need it at all and can take a risk, or you need it for next year tuition (then don't put it in bitcoin or anything else risky).
General rule is that if it worries you it might be too much. But often people fool themselves about investment "risks". The biggest risk of investing is not investing enough and early in life. They think that saving it on a savings account or in cash isn't risky. But its a certain lost against inflation (and maybe more, countless of times banks didn't pay back the money), while cash certainly has no upside. Bitcoin is a more risky investment but it might be huge one day.
If you think that bitcoin might not succeed because of other crypto you might just want to read more about it.

I have been in property development in the Netherlands for some years. Two of the companies i worked for used clever tactics to get building permits and owned valuable land. But in the last crisis it was also clear that local governments owned land (which brought them in problems when prices fell due to the crisis). So they not only gave out permits but also speculated themselves on those lands (which is highly uncountable of course).

In many countries this doesn't apply fyi.
In my country the price difference between farm land and buildable land is between 50-100x. Then any farmer would build houses in your theory.


True, but governments and bankers know this too and used this to sell this scheme to the average person. Historically you had to borrow way less for a family house than you have to now.

From a miner perspective it indeed doesn't matter. Only some will go broke if they don't get a higher price (but bitcoin will work fine in both ways).
From a market perspective the halving will reduce its daily fresh supply from 1800 coins a day to 900 coins. If this is huge depends on the person, i think it is not super significant.
From a psychological perspective it is huge, bitcoin becomes once again rarer. If the demand for bitcoin stays the same, it means that there is not enough fresh bitcoin which means the price increases (supply &amp; demand), which then means that people start to act on it making this effect bigger than it really is. Which makes many people speculating on it and even giving it a bigger effect.
As the real impact probably is not so big, the human factor should not be underestimated.

I doubt if those countries would skip a lot of benefits for the average citizen to just raise military spending to 5% of gdp would be well taken and good for the happiness.

So lets calcualte: 10.000$ sale
= 9.660 $ received in paypal. 
Lets take an average of 2.5% conversion rate to euro. That makes it 9.418 $ (in euros) on my paypal account.
So a 10k$ transaction cost 580$ by using paypal.

It all depends on their situation. And we simply don't know it so we can't give any such financial advice. 
If they have 3 maxed out credit cards and a house which is under water and a low income plus some debt at a mobster they should cash out immediately.
But if they are well set, they earn a salary of more than a bitcoin per month and don't need the cash (many have way too much cash), their is no need to suddenly cash out in this bear market. They should at least start to learn what bitcoin is. The person who gave this inheritance probably did, so it would be nice if they can continue in that thought.
Let say you get silverware from someone who past away worth 10k$, are you directly going to liquidate it at any price and/or speculate with it like you proposed?

When i hold bitcoin i gain. When i don't hold bitcoin i don't lose (besides the opportunity) on something i don't hold.
For example if tomorrow with all bitcoin holders and traders agree the price is set to 1 million per coin and people are okay to buy it at that price. We all gained ~1 million per coin while no one lost money. The people who then buy it basically agree that the price is 1 million worth to them.
Who really lost in this case?

In my country the real inflation is around this level shown here. The tax which you need to pay over the capital adds another 1.2% extra down per year. All while the interest level in the most risky savings account are worth less than 0.5% a year.

So you expect the low/middle class to be more clever than banks and governments combined? Not really logic right? Banks even sold interest default swaps to many businesses while they knew it was garbage, but those dummy business owners should just have know better right? Even most banks themselves hardly understand the products they make (watch '08 for example). A normal working person with an average iq and education is fish food for them.

Indeed, but few have the guts to do so.
@_date: 2019-02-10 17:17:42
That is true indeed. But few can actually time the market, hence why people here tell buy and hold. Also bitcoin is hard if not impossible to valuate. So it is no wonder that the price goes from 1k$ to 20k back to 3k$ in just some years. As some are wildly enthusiast about it and some economic "professors" are wishing it to die for many years already.
On something like bitcoin it is most likely the best (if not only) strategy to make gains long term. 
As your new to bitcoin it is likely that you have a higher chance that you will not fully understand the trading or those altcoin (scams), hence why so many people try to warn you. 
Nothing wrong with trying things though. And most of us lost money in some way or did something wrong too. Just don't fall for the pitfalls you can easily avoid by spending some time .

Maybe it does effect spending/economies, but is it really bad is the question. Most people anyway consume their money over their life don't they? Countries were the saving rate is higher the inflation rate is lower and still the economies are stronger. So it is hard to say that inflation is a good thing. 
The only thing i for sure know for which inflation is good that is for the (central)banks, government and (super) wealthy.

You can just mathematically confirm that usd is worse than bitcoin over a span of 10-15 years. You don't have to be a rocket scientist for that neither.
The only thing it comes down to what you "speculate" on is trust.
But that really counts for everything like: investing in stock, gold, RE, bonds, fiat, art or land.
So as with any those things, if you diversify your "bets", is it really still speculation in your opinion?

Manipulation maybe, but markets tend to overreact in both ways. When you bought bitcoin was overvalued and now it probably is undervalued (hard to say as its not really calculate-able).
Benjamin Graham perfectly wrote this as mr market, the market who depressive one day and exegetic the next day (or year of course).
The problem is that we all keep falling for it over and over. Even if you know how it all works its hard to resist. A great quote: "buy when there's blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own".

Saifedean Ammous does that very well for you in his book "the bitcoin standard".
The technologies that u/theartlav lists, or you like the PDA's are just at a whole different ball park.

As a matter of fact, bitcoin is trying to out beat the shelf life not of an electronic but of fiat currencies, in which it already beaten some.

Yea i have been hoping this for many years. But i highly doubt it by now.
Bitcoin might be the catalyst, but it will likely take decades.
Those different economies/currencies, just play along while all doing exactly the same thing. Only Switzerland is an outstanders, they just print the same amount of money to not let the exchange rate go wild and with all that extra currency they buy real assets (funny enough from those other parties! :) ).
But it is very unlikely that the USD will brake because of this reason very soon. Only when all normal citizens starts to lose trust, we might be on to something. Be we are very very very far removed from that still.
I think the book "currency wars" might be a good read for you if you haven't yet.
@_date: 2019-02-18 20:28:57
Yea true, maybe in the best case scenario governments are forced to reduce their spending to compete with their fiat to bitcoin so that we never really get into that Territory.

Someone started this by sending bitcoin over LN and pass it on to the next who tweets a LN invoice, by adding every time 10.000 satoshis. So this went on for like hundred transactions. Until this  just broke the trust. He received the satoshis but did not send it further anymore.

Yes i can see that for satellite phones. I'm not really familiar with that time period or technological growth so i can't really say anything about it.
But portable tv's or Interactive newspapers?
With bitcoin there are two things going on. On one part it is technological advancement itself. So this indeed has to compete with many other crypto currencies and is likely to not always be the "best".
But bitcoin is also a money/SoV, this is something which doesn't going to change every year because of new technology. Think about it, 99%+ of the world citizens still are not totally convinced about bitcoin so they instead rather use their less good fiat currency. Even in countries with 20%+ inflation most people still use their own currency instead of a euro or dollar which inflates only at ~2%. But only the few clever ones buying dollars and euros.
It will take decades to get more trust of people, but that's okay. Bitcoin isn't in a hurry. It isn't going to scam people unlike their counterparts (both alts and fiats). History shows time and time again that people will find the hardest currency by themselves. And i bet you that this debt laden inflationary world will sooner or later open its eyes.

Yes very true, they indeed have been "abusing" those programs to put their effect in a very narrow way. But still they increase the money supply basically which always get followed up by inflation over time. The problem is that it takes a long time before the money which they putted in really trickled down to the bottom (us).
Btw the only smart central bank imo is that of Switzerland who just starter to print money to not let the exchange rate go wild, with that newly created money they just started to buy real assets, which raised quickly in value because of those other central banks pumping them up. A genius move imo.
@_date: 2019-02-28 09:29:17
I tent to agree with you. Although if you look for example at the nodes list, you see exactly all those western countries who run (at least the don't hide) all the nodes. With Germany and The Netherlands leading the top.
Those were like the countries who had run a pretty secure low inflationary currency for decades. So even in such countries were the need is actually not that high there is still a huge support.
Yes most people probably don't care, but they don't care about many things, the group of people who do care about it is growing fast. I think the internet is doing a very good job in giving people a real change to get some proper education (me included, without internet i was pretty doomed imo). The information you now easily find makes it that more and more people will see/understand the truth.
It takes time though, painful lessons, some heavy time investment from users etc.

I happen to think so. But if i read the BIS report for example, my hopes are pretty much destroyed for seeing any fight at all. I mean did they even try by reading such report? I surely hope that is like 5% of their aiming power but probably that is already an A game employer they used.
They are probably just think it is not going to happen for a long while, then they are confused. And then their offices get shutdown and they are getting kicked on the street.

Hardware mining builders is a very competitive business and Bitmain will not stay in the monopolist position as they have today, someone will break their business sooner rather than later.

I think it is not totally wrong. Those speculators give it value too (even if it is just to speculate). They pay money to get in and give it a value, yes there take is very speculative and with crazy fluctuation. But this gives both more attention to speculative investors also getting in and getting attention to people who (slowly) start to understand the real value behind bitcoin.
And that latter one is an ongoing process which takes a lot of time. Many bitcoin fans have been attracted to bitcoin in the first place just by the wild price fluctuations, only then to learn what bitcoin is all about.

Yes, so giving him advise to speculate on a short term downward trade is real good advise to you? 
He should or learn what bitcoin is and they might hold onto it, or he should just liquidate the bitcoin for a one time cash advance. I bet you that the "hodl" will be the best advise if he does his own research.
@_date: 2019-02-28 09:47:31
Trading gives liquidity and that makes it actually very good. The most liquid market in the world is EUR/USD, mostly because it is traded upon very heavily.

@_date: 2019-02-07 15:30:53
Yea sure. Let me remind you that it is not 1950 anymore. If not other countries will think for themselves the people in it will.
I'm not saying that it wouldn't hurt bitcoin. America has influence on bitcoin for sure. But it isn't even the biggest fiat currency for trading bitcoin! And the problem with a decentralized blockchain is that you can't effectively ban it. Remember how they "banned" the downloading industry? They came back with technologies which were ten times harder to ban. 
You think that the people who are working in this space and tasted a small piece of this true freedom by taking control over OUR money will go back sit back in corner and give his toys over to the government? Besides that, the countries who will not block it will get a major head start over the US, you think that the US can afford such ever losing power considering the state of the country is in?

Basically you pay around 1.2% a year over your total cap. Regardless of your profit. 
An advantage is that it takes way less administrative burden. Plus that if you make returns like in the past from bitcoin it is a cheap bargain.
If you make less then 1.2%, basically your taxed at 100+% (For example like the interest rate of .1%). That really sucks of course.
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:55:25

It will have to be a store of value first before it will be used as a currency in the west.
You took Venezuela as an example and exactly shows why we need bitcoin and why it will succeed. There are more countries like that, sooner or later they will also start to stock on bitcoin instead of usd/eur.
And exactly this phenomenon is why bitcoin will exist and out perform everything else. It is because people do TRUST it. Let it  just be that our fiat currency is all about trust too and those who control it haven't taken that trust so serous the last decades.

Lending in a strong (strongest) money is always stupid.
Who will lend some Venezuelan some dollars right now? It doesn't matter what interest you set, you go bust on that one.
Same will be for bitcoin for decades to come. If something like 2017 happened again your debt just went x20.
I know people who put their mortgage in Swiss Francs (against the euro). They had negative interest for a while! Seems nice no? 1% receiving interest! The only problem was that the mortgage total amount has gone up in euro value of about 25%. Not so good deal after all.

I like the idea of taking money in easy money (bad money) and putting it in hard money (bitcoin). But its not advisable to go into debt for investments, especially not something as risky as bitcoin. And he already sleeps bad when he just has 10% of his net worth in it. Imagine how the debt burden will feel to him?
@_date: 2019-02-18 21:11:24


I have lived in a country which was in war and had a 25+% inflation, yet many didn't seek to euro/usd. Actually the country besides of course the tragic stories was doing "okish". It might be less horrible as we now project. The people who (early) understood bitcoin will be well rewarded, the middle group will do decently and the last would suffer, but it isn't that our current systems don't have countless amounts of people who are suffering under it.
@_date: 2019-02-04 10:07:18

@_date: 2019-02-25 17:32:11
Easy to say for him. Inflation works in his advantage. 99% of the people are at a disadvantage he eagerly profits from. 
But he also doesn't believe in gold. He just wants cash flow investments. Not sure if his "opinion" is that important in bitcoin. I like Warren, but i actually even have no clue why he has to say things about it, probably just because "journalists" keep asking him about it.

I did send way more LN transactions than btc transactions. (i have to agree it is just to fool around). But i do think that the numbers are pretty impressive!

True, but on the other hand. People who profited from bitcoin or just want to see it succeed will/can run a node regardless of profits.

@_date: 2019-02-05 11:40:57
Yea i was struggling with this idea as well lately.
Like let say you calculate your current holdings and do it x130 to get at around the gold valuation. But do you really want to cash out at that point? What is then as safe as bitcoin? Probably still the best way to keep it in, but the return upside will be less. So maybe just deversify a bit among RE/stocks if those are priced not too high at that point.
@_date: 2019-02-24 18:00:23
I recently saw the documentary about Stuxnet. Pretty interesting if such parties already tried to brake bitcoin too.

So because you are good technology shouldn't be improved? Narcissistic much maybe?
I have paid thousands of fee to PayPal, so i clearly know what isn't working. You will grand me the difference from what i ever paid in PayPal fees and what i could have saved by doing transactions with bitcoin, deal? 
You want to put money where your mouth is? I can show you how bitcoin works better than paypal by doing a transaction to each other, want to do that? Say the $$ amount and we get it going.
Cursing doesn't make your points look better, it only shows what a joke you actually are..

Lol, here we got a "bitcoin city" with hundreds of retailers who accept it. With payment providers such as Mollie and coingate, you got thousands of websites were you could pay. The biggest food home delivery website in Europe "thuisbezorgd.nl" accepted bitcoin since 2013. 
But yea no one right? Maybe in your country there isn't technological improvement, that can be indeed. In USA they still use Cheques. I mean wtf? I haven't used those in like 15 years. But it seems they still can survive too, so you don't have to worry that much. The world will go further regardless of what you and i want.

It will not be widespread used like that. But when 1 bitcoin buys the same amount of stuff over a decade it will be the most preferable payment option.
The point is that if it is widely spread the value (buying power) will maybe fluctuate 1-2% per year at max.

@_date: 2019-02-03 14:12:05
Yes it has a platform but basically they themself start to acknowledge that it doesn't work in the current way. Not saying that ETH wouldn't survive, but as you can see that even coins in the top 3 aren't really a sure thing yet. Which makes it rather impossible to catch those 5% which will survive.
But if you think you have an edge and know how to do just that. Go ahead and push maximal profits out of it!
@_date: 2019-02-25 17:26:14
I would argue the same. But humans are a special species. The fresh supply will likely have an impact. Because there will be a little less new daily supply and people might know this fact but i think most don't really understand it.

Wealth inequality will always exist, you can't expect that the guy working 100+ hours a week who runs an Electric car company and at the same time some space company does bring home the same amount as a cleaner who bring in 32 hours.
The problem with the current wealth inequality is that a few people take huge advantage of the current system while the majority never can get ahead as the whole system is designed for people to fail miserably.

We are going to see some real crazy spikes in the coming bull run. Frist 10k$ a day spike will happen for sure.
it is pretty weird that there so many bitcoin maximalist who hold their coins pretty tight. Many normal people who learned what bitcoin really is and hold strongly even through rough downturns. When then the way up is started there are actually few sellers left to provide the coins for the demand. Which will fuel the whole thing again. More demand, higher prices, more speculation, more real building, more newcomers who start to understand bitcoin etc.

If you really don't need the money just invest it as that is clearly the best way you can spent money. Let it be bitcoin or stocks or whatever you think is going to be a good investment (always think about the downside though and diversify for if you were wrong after all).

Indeed so what u end up is people using houses as a SoV  and buying hundreds of houses just to protect themselves and earn rent. Result is high housing prices (in the places that matter), high rent, high speculation. So you end up with few owning everything and be able to buy houses (those who can afford the risk to have one or multiple mortgages). And why is this good? Of course to boom the sick banking industry, they happily give out mortgages based on imaginary deposits.


Indeed bitcoin and fiat will exist parallel for decades to come, but slowly bitcoin will swallow up big financial assets like a big black hole.
But that indeed i think was/is their play. Debt/inflationary system is basically a slavery system without many people even realizing it. And even when you do it is hard to get out of it easily/completely.

Oh sure, many people will lose money. I for example bought about ten years ago for 600$ in pharma stock on the bet that they introduce a new medicine. Now ten years later it is worth 30% of the orginal investment and at one point it was at -95%. And they actually are selling the medicine right now!! It was like a quick lesson for me to be more clever with my investment decisions. (Imagine if that one relative low level investment was put in bitcoin, i would have been multi millionaire..).
Most "crypto" projects like you refer to are just scams at times when the money floated easily around. Most of those scams hardly ever will get back to the heights they once reached.
Bitcoin is very different though, but sure even bitcoin can still fail (i would be very sad if it does, but not for the money though). But even with bitcoin you need to know how markets work, how you can lose money in/by trading etc.

We as bitcoiners should start to ignore (punish) more of the exchanges and 3rd parties who do walk the wrong line.
It is better to support services which are "only" bitcoin, they have the same interest in it to succeed. They will improve bitcoin and work on the new implementations, instead of just adding shitcoins to their system and wasting valuable time on that shit.

Arbitrage makes that it goes across exchanges. The quicker you can do the arbitrage the more profit you have. So basically this means that in seconds the profits are gone and the price is/gets stable across all exchanges.

Also not totally accurate. There is certainly an amount of fiat money on exchanges which can directly put into bitcoin. It doesn't give support on the books, but it definitely is available.
Another big stack is for example USDT with over $2.6B ready to step in too.
There are very likely bots out there who could do this automatically (so giving it a hidden floor).

All liquidity is in fiat &lt;&gt; bitcoin.
Most (if not all) shitcoins are traded against bitcoin and there is very little (real) liquidity in it. So they just follow or even exaggerate the bitcoin movements. But few of the gains are real though, wait until everyone is going to cash out on their shitty investments and see how quickly things go south.

That's why i think we should have better ways to open/close LN channels. Factories can do this later right? Not really know much about those improvements though, but they are very well needed as indeed insane high fees will hurt LN.

Their servers need some rest of course, they run a very special kind of servers. One that can create money out of nothing. And as their system s*cks they need to be there all the time while those servers are running.
But of course a real banker doesn't work weekends.

Money has value because of the SoV part not visa versa. The dollar and Euro for example are pretty stable and in the next 1-2 years you don't lose much value. So you can store your wealth in it without much risk. Giving the money/currency value. If you have another money like Bolivars, which clearly holds no value you hold it like an hot coal.
If you look back at the past ten years of bitcoin you can easily see that it has value to people. Otherwise we aren't paying 5000$ a coin after countless of bubbles who have been "popped".

Yes banks suck at this. They are really annoying. 
If you withdraw the money next time tell them you don't think it is safe to hold the money into their bankaccount as their fractional reserves are too low and you don't get any money (interest) in return to oppose those high risks you taken on YOUR money.
GF for them to oppose those facts.

Don't tell how many bitcoins you have (for security reasons), to no one!
Don't buy bitcoin on Robinhood, but actually buy REAL bitcoins. From any legit exchange. But a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger and put your bitcoins safely on it.

True derivatives are pure evil.


Yes, my bank has been giving me below 1% for most part of that 10 years, its now at 0.03%... It is sickening, yet it is not increasing the inflation actually. (Inflation is yet again falling!).
But still the world will not globally collapse you know, even when shit hits the fan we figure it out. And it the really worst worst case scenario we just wipe the slates clean. 
For me it becomes more unlikely that a total melt down in finance actually brings a world or at least civilized country to a complete stop. Sure some hard years and some chaos will follow, but to see my country in Venezuelan current state is like zero % chance.

\&gt; Land in downtown capital cities for example is way more limited 
I worked for a project developer and we had always loads of valueless land. As soon as we got building permissions the value of the land from around 6$ per m2 rose to up to 750$ a m2. Why? Not because suddenly the land became scare, only become we fixed a "scare" license to build houses on it. 
I bet you that any land around any major city is at least 20 times less valuable then the land where the houses are build on. So the land isn't scare, the licenses to build on it. Guess who give out licenses? 
\&gt; Its your duty to back up your claims showing evidence. Specially when  you are claming some kinng of global manipulation over the best terrains  worldwide 
There is so much data to be found about this subject, but i can't convince you in here so i am not even gonna try.

I don't know the exact details, but when you create your wallet you already create all the keys in it. So when you setup an Electrum wallet you see all the keys + private keys inside it. 
It's called HD wallet i think, they made it this way so that it is more easy to make one wallet address and have many address under need that one seed (less chance to lose some private keys).
@_date: 2019-04-04 12:59:30
Yes it's too late, we will go to the moon without you now.
Jokes aside, you had to learn more about bitcoin when no body seemed interested. Learn about bitcoin so that you can make the decision yourself. Coinbase is so-so, they are probably okish but maybe better to use Bitstamp.
Not your keys not your bitcoin, store them by yourself.
Try to buy a low amount and see what bitcoin is/does. Play around with it.

Let your winners ride, otherwise your whole portfolio soon will exist of shitty second choices.
Naah i get that 69% might be too much exposure. But just diversify or sell because of a number is rather stupid. Just look at that moment if there are good other investments out there, maybe stocks are cheap. Maybe it makes at that time even more sense to own bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:54:54
So study the data and make a model yourself. It can be interesting for sure! A good study might for sure bring some lights in both direction. There are just a lot of uncertainties, that's why i think most are not up for a change yet.

Some Venezuelans now work for in-game money.
So literally in-game coins are working better then some fiat money. It shows how ingenious people are when it really matters about surviving.
 Now with internet it became way easier to find our way and the government is left clueless. You can literally set up a random company somewhere across the globe in one hour. Accept a currency like bitcoin. You can even buy some E-passport while you never go to that country. The ways government has done their "business" in the past are well over. (Luckily).

@_date: 2019-04-03 11:53:54
Works for a government in the EU and can't do basic math. This story is legit!
Also the income tax is just were things started. Then you pay 21% on the goods you buy. A hefty tax above that on alcohol/cigarettes and other pleasures to escape the hard life for a while.
You have to pay road taxes to get to your job, which needs buying fuel and of course you again are heavily taxed on that.
Actually it would be interesting to see the total tax you pay in a year, but i guess no government ever is paying statistics to get that figured out.

If the electricity usage is such a big problem, why we are making so much electricity then right now? I mean it is not really that bitcoin miners are choosing to buy the worst electricity. If all energy would be green they would be pretty much buy it anyway.
So isn't the real question here, why we are still building bad power plants? Why they are still operated? Why there are still coal and lignite mines active to mine just for the sake of providing electricity?
In my country daily big ships arrive from across the globe (you know those ships which burn through the worst energy out there mainly bunker fuel). Then they put the coal over on smaller ships and ship it to Germany. They bring coal from around the world because it is cheaper to mine in Chili and ship it all the way to Germany to burn it for some cheapo electrics.

That's how it should in theory yes, but our current system is far from that. And you could argue that it kind of works (like how we escaped the real problems in 2008). But very very likely all those stimulant is going to get back at the economy ten times harder in the future.
Somehow we are at a point that we think we are operating a free market but are in need to central plan the oil of the machine it runs on (money).


Yes that is how i feel. But those nimwits around me are very eager to work for their mortgage and scream from joy when their 100% leverage house is up 5% in a year.

Yes unfortunately inflation is eating a little of the income of normal people away every year. In my country there is wage stagnation since the 1980's at least... It is really sad. And in that same time the economic output quadrupled or so.
@_date: 2019-04-04 08:29:20

No, there is no end to raise the block size. If the tx fees are cheap the demand will ever increase, so ever increasing block size.  So you end up with a central database, just like the feds. Then bitcoin is not bitcoin anymore, you get that right?
@_date: 2019-04-21 23:02:58
Yes i agree once again. To be honest i think the chances are that my government by itself go after the citizens bitcoin is like zero.
Maybe if all other governments come up with some plan they might want to participate in it. But then again it is not likely it will hurt the people that much. But such thing differs a lot from one country to another i guess.
The article goes on the reading list, cheers.

Sure, but imagine they own one million dollar. Then they suddenly need to learn anyway how the banking takes 2-5% away through inflation. 1 Million in the bank is risky too. If you just have all the cash and start to live an "wealthy" life the money is gone rapidly.
Bitcoin might be a great way to store your wealth, it doesn't necessarily educate people about personal finance at all.

Regularly the cards are not working (cards break, machines stop working, bank server problems etc). You have more privacy, you are more in control with using btc over cards, etc etc.
But it is not 100x better then cards, so it is unlikely that people will start paying with bitcoin over cards as for the average joe the advantage seem not so big.

Yes but there is a big difference between Euphoria and your "high"... 
To be clear, the previous the previous ATH was around 1.1k$. In beginning of 2017 we were around price and bitcoin started to exelerate throughout the year. Not buying after that 1.1k$ was not the best decision imo.
Euphoria came when 10-20% a day gains seemed normal and no one had a clue that it isn't normal.

The whole fiat ponzi scheme is build on that so as long as bitcoin can survive it will grow by just countering the fiat scam.
And as long as bitcoin absorbs the ponzi scheme like a big black whole it keeps growing at astounding rates. I even start to think that the growth will start to increase the next time.
@_date: 2019-04-14 07:47:28
That helps, but the on ramp in bitcoin is often not anonymous.
If you buy bitcoin from some random person on the street with cash it is very anon. But if you but it on an exchange where you fully verified with id's and have a bank account/credit card used for payments it is hardly any anon.
There is a Wasabi wallet which can make your bitcoin more anon (by mixing your coin and many others).
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:55:40


That would actually only improve the adoption of bitcoin and decreases the need or want for bitcoin. 
Let's put it another way, you want to sell something and someone offers you bitcoin at that moment for it. (You know they are worth $1 millions now). Do you take this valuable asset or do you let a profitable trade go by?

I like it.
You can already see it happening though. Some countries take the restriction/regulation path. Both people and businesses move out of such countries.
While some advanced countries have a different opinion (they don't publicly tell they like bitcoin often), but they show that they are interested and open for change. Here all the new start ups show up. Innovation brings brings prosperity to those who embrace it, it hurt those who reject it.
But because bitcoin will disrupt so much there are only few countries really ready for such disruptive change.

No it is not, but do research it yourself first.
Some quick information about some good sources, its best to do your own research.
 - great videos to give you a good understanding of what bitcoin is. Highly recommend it to watch at least some of his conferences.
The book: "The Bitcoin Standard" from author Saifedean Ammous - it will give you a better understanding of what money is!
If you really got into it this far, there is another great source to entertain yourself even longer!:

While they could create their own crypto to have control and a way to give their citizens a cryptocurrency.
Those countries inevitable start to use or already using bitcoin. Bitcoin will become the dominant tool for doing such transactions which are forbidden by watchdog US. And good that this will take place, it is much better to keep doing commerce with each other (even if the US doesn't like it). Instead of giving them a visit with the military complex.

Also if you make investment decisions like putting 1% of your net worth into something totally unrelated to traditional investments it is hardly a gamble on itself. More a hedge or insurance policy.
Put it all depends on the person buying/investing/"gambling", sure many people in the bitcoin or especially in the altcoin space are pure speculators/gamblers.
But bitcoin being young and totally new definitely makes it risky.

Yea in such case it might be nice to wipe the transaction history from time to time.
As long as you remember the seeds and your strategy of wallet usage you can't really do it wrongly. But when you make it complicated it might lose you track of your own coins or you make mistakes with backup etc.
You could also use temporary hot wallets for some quick transactions and then just remove them if you want. I do that sometimes.

"The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from product sales or other means, and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds." - Where actually house buyers think the profits come from? Magically raising indefinitely houses prices right?
"A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds"  - V just keep the interest low, make the rules easier. Take two salaries instead of one. etc. "we both know that once the next crisis comes and finishes, real state prices in populares cites will reach ath once again"

My tax money bailed out banks who do not provide me any service, so bitcoin does help me to use them less.
If i have money in the bank at any time the government or anyone else can freeze my account (my account which hold my money but isn't even legally mine).
With the money in the bank you support an inflationary system with all the problems who come with this (war, poverty, consumerism, short time prev etc).

There are some fin tech companies doing exactly this model already (Revolut for example), they are getting popular especially under travelers. Competition is always good.

Sure this does exist psychologically. I know that, but i hardly ever seen a market where such people or such phenomenon moves the market. What they are buying, one coin? 5 Coins max?
The coinbase alone today is 280$m a month and at 10k it is 550$m. The market has been absorbing that without much problem in the last years. I hardly doubt that the selling pressure of some uneducated investors is going to "ruin" the market. 


Think about it, if you got 10.000 coins at 1$ for example. At the height you have like 200 Mil, what you are going to do with 200m cash? Sure people cash out to have fun, they cash out to risk averse. But many holders just hold because it is still the best asset they can think about. Many early investors in bitcoin didn't cash out for example and they are louder then ever in their voices for bitcoin as a future.

Yea true. I think the biggest sell of will be from speculators on margin. And quiet frankly i have not a clear view on how big this in bitcoin and its impact on the price.
I was falsely thinking about a crisis which would happen right now, it could be in a total different climate indeed.
But what helps me to support my idea is that i noticed that there really are many bitcoin die hards who hodl bravely even when we are down ~80% without any sweat. It is different imo from traditional markets where most retail investors would have been shaken out and scared to dead right now.

Oh yes there are always more taxes. And even if that is not enough, once in a while they come up with a new tax. 
Also they start to heavily abuse the tax system to control how people act/react. If they want for example electric cars to succeed to increase the tax on fuel cars and meanwhile subsidize EV. So basically they even let you have less choice too (or let you heavily pay for it).

Maybe the same way you bought in?
Bitcoin is volatile, both up and down you can expect much more 10% moves in a day. Few bitcoins are actually moving around so the money going in and out bitcoin might offside the price a lot in a very short time period.
Learn why bitcoin is "slow" from time to time.  There you can see how much fees are getting paid to be included in the next block(s).
Being scared in investments are never a good thing though (but beware that not doing anything, aka putting money in a savings account is still an investment and can actually be a very bad decision, most people fail to get that. It can cost you a lot over long periods of time). So the point is to educate yourself enough about markets, investing, bitcoin etc. It's probably the best time investment you can make (especially if you are still young). Read books! (Yes boring and i hate it, but it helped me hugely).
  - great videos to give you a good understanding of what bitcoin is. Highly recommend it to watch at least some of his conferences.
The book: "The Bitcoin Standard" from author Saifedean Ammous - it will give you a better understanding of what money is!
If you really got into it this far, there is another great source to entertain yourself even longer!:

Just watch to the other cycles. Zoom in on those. Another cycle will just do the same but with higher numbers, more developers, more new projects/ideas, more money, money people.
Bitcoin is like a financial black hole, slowly absorbing a bigger and bigger part of the financial world. And the beauty is that it is enforcing itself. Because it is more valuable it is more secure, because it is more secure it is more reliable/valuable. Because bitcoin is valuable it is trustworthy (Store of Value). It just all bounces back and forth. While more people getting into this game it is like throwing oil on fire.

It doesn't matter how we classify it, it is all about human perception. I'm pretty sure that in Venezuela their bolívar is the only classified money. And yet they take everything as money accept bolívar probably. Bitcoin surely doesn't have the same status as big well known currencies, but that is okay.
But you are right, the bitcoin is just a bitcoin and it should have the same value as it is trading on open market. And you are right that if you don't really need bitcoin you could ask for a premium while accepting bitcoin (for the effort to convert it). But that is the same way that other people will give you a discount as they will like more the bitcoin as opposed to the currency (in weaker economies this would/could be the case).

Besides that, with bitcoin it is not really barter, just another currency. There are many countries where you a double currency functioning very well (in most high inflation countries). The local currency is used for daily things. While buying a car or house suddenly is in dollars or euros. 
There is no problem to that as anyone easily know the value of usd/eur. This is a perfect environment where bitcoin can easily take over that role. (Once again in the future, as it should be less volatile first).

Gold will not be totally replaced. That is not the goal. The goal for me is that it should be at least as valuable. Right now bitcoin need like x70 or around ~350k$ per coin to have an equal market cap?
To be honest i don't think that would take so long. Think about it, bitcoin became to where it is today by only negative news, "important" people who vouch against it, bubble pops which seems severe every time they happen.
And yet in just 10 years it is worth 90B$. It reached already about 1% of the gold value. The thing is with gold that historically it was a good thing. It still is useful, but in the current system it is rather useless. CB's own a big part of gold, they are happy to own the gold but they don't want it for you to succeed as they want you to use their fiat currencies instead. I hardly doubt that they will let all those gold bugs win to ruin their game, they are just to good at playing/manipulating their own game.
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:11:37


For you maybe, is gold a currency? Or Western union, or swiss banking, or hedging your local shit fiat? It can all be done with bitcoin.
\&gt;The way I'm seeing it after this discussion, its value would definitely  tank at least a little bit if major countries tried to lock down its  use. 
Some countries ban it, for example China has tried it and many other. It didn't matter at all. Maybe if the US or EU bans it, there will be temporarily panic and depressed prices. That's normal though, it wouldn't kill the project anymore though.
\&gt;It still seems like a pretty risky store of value right now. 
Sure it is more risky, especially on the history it will never beat gold for example. But the risk also gives the greatest opportunities. Bitcoin in my opinion can reach at least the market value of gold (so 350.000$ per coin). And you don't have to store all the wealth in it, 1% is already significant for some parties. So you risk just 1% and have still a good exposure to it if it does succeed.

An Hardware wallet solves the secure part of it maybe, but we still have long way to go to really securely safe the seeds.

There is no second time. That is why bitcoin development is the way it is. Bitcoin isn't a fixed asset like gold either, it's code. If the need is there we can change things. But the point is that it all together makes it valuable. Not just the code. The idea, the trust of bitcoin being bitcoin, the code, the nodes, the miners, the brand. You can't just redo that. It is not a tech play like how Apple may be better then Microsoft, or visa versa. 


Very likely, as it is just impossible to do transactions like Visa or M on a decentralized ledger in the current form bitcoin is designed. Bitcoins blockchain ledger is way too valuable to do useless transactions on. Indeed bitcoin is more like P2P digital gold. But as you said there can be other layers to do P2P payments on, LN works pretty neat i would say. But definitely has not the UX yet to compete with traditional payment systems.
But may point stays the same, we can only do this once correctly. The same way we don't hop from gold to silver to whatever metal we think now will be appropriate to be a SoV. Or the same way we don't switch from reserve currency to reserve currency every few years. Lets be honest, the dollar is rather shitty. But yet it will stay the reserve currency until that whole thing explodes. Until then it will just keep being the  currency, while it might have zero real reasons left to be so.

Learn about the technology behind Torrents. There is a good medium article about Bittorrent for example.
They can't regulate it the original way, that's the point. There isn't even a "bitcoin.inc" no where in the world. How exactly they will regulate a decentralized money in the same way?
Sure they can forbid it, but will that work in this day and age?

Yes that is true when exchanges accept it. I think the developments in the next 1-2 year will be good and give a more clear path on how it goes.
Yea true if you don't need to open the channels too often its not a problem. The good thing is that i think more and more people agree to that the first layer will have higher fees. And now people accept this idea more and see that it is needed for a secure blockchain for when the coinbase gets lower.

That is not the problem, you do understand free markets right? People who can afford the tx will pay for it.
Imagine how many people want to write data in the bitcoin blockchain if the tx always is let say 1 cent per tx. Literally billions of transactions will be start to pile up!
Let say NYSE comes with the brilliant idea to start stamping their data in the blockchain. After all 1 cent for such secure data is a bargain.
This is the current volume, can you imagine all that extra transactions?
And that is just one party seeking for cheap ultra secure time stamping.
That's why multiple layers are unavoidable. I opened a LN channel for example like half a year ago for 0.007$ in fee, until now i made hundreds of small transactions all with the one entry on the blockchain. And i can do many more still.

Throw in some btc address, type the amount of btc, go through the payment portal and done.

It doesn't make sense. If a company makes 30% on investments it has zero need to pay out dividend, they should shovel those dollars on their great business to generate more dollars.
If the company has too much money coming in and can't really generate a good return anymore, often their business becomes worse. Sure they can then be dividend cows for a while and generate returns, but often that doesn't last all that long.
Most companies pay out dividend to keep guys like you happy as both you and the company haven't got a clue what they actually are doing.

Of course exchanges are legitimate businesses just like the stock market exchanges are..  Why you think they need all the licenses and shit? If people sign up to conbase or other exchanges they should expect as normal folks to buy real things which are legitimate.

That's not how LN works.. I opened 1 channel like almost a year ago and it still just works fine. All payments/receipts are going through that one channel just fine.
If you open a couple high liquid ones and some random ones you have a very solid connection on LN. It routes through the network without any problems.

You can save whatever is good for you. It can be 50 cents a day, 1 dollar. Whatever you can afford to save up. 
Also saving is based on your income. It is always good to try to save a decent amount of money. And now you can add it a bit of savings into bitcoin.
Just make sure that you don't need that extra money, otherwise maybe you have to sell at a bad time and lose.

Private and business is also just very different. 
Personally i accept bitcoins privately but also do not bother with them business wise (i could for years). The tax nightmare, extra chance on audits, administration nightmare (dates, VAT, etc), you have to exchange it probably etc.

Its a business, they can handle risk and understand what they are doing.
And they can easily just stop the 0conf after one failed attempt. If they accept creditcard they likely pay 2% or more. So 2700 sales rake in 54$ per transaction in extra profit. 
Let that last part sink in. So even if the fraud is happening at less then 2% of all btc sales they still make a profit to offer this option!

Billions of people just can't use the blockchain as bitcoins first layer to do multiple transactions a day. It is just not how bitcoin/blockchain works.
I agree that low tx fees are preferable and everybody should be able to use the benefits of bitcoin. But it is just impossible to do all of that on 1 chain.
\&gt;PayPal’s fee’s as I never really use it. Just when I have used it to send $$ P2P I’ve never had any fee’s that I was aware of.

Learn about finance and investing instead of wasting money... Instead of "playing" with stocks you should have done the research and not waste time nor money..
Hope you will have better luck with the bitcoin thing though. Just don't buy high and sell low.. Hold as long as possible. Do some research!

Buying bitcoin is the easy way which hurt most. Helping Bitcoin adoption (education materials, btc business, making it easier to let people buy).
Spreading information on the internet about how the current system works (financial/political etc), you will be surprised how many good materials are out there. They just need to be found by the people who are interested in learning a thing or two.
And more ways which i am not gonna disclose here on a public forum.

You think that will hold bitcoin back? They start to understand that the system sucks in one or two years after finishing the study. A perfect way to find their way to bitcoin and see the get introduced. How you think all those millennials now into bitcoin found it in the first place?
@_date: 2019-04-22 07:24:07
Not really.
It is likely that the interest on loans stay at around the current level while the savings interest dips into rough waters.
So you pay 3% for a mortgage and you pay 3% on your savings account.

So you don't know the benefits of bitcoin basically?
-Resilient 
-Censorship resistance
-No 3th parties needed
-Strict inflation which gets really low in about a year and from then on goes slowly to zero (giving it a deflationary effect, already).
-more secure
With a combination of those bullet points you can make endless use cases. So sure, the bitcoin is not just merely a "currency".

Should you? If you think bitcoin has value and continue to do so i don't think it is too late. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:16:13


It really depends on the use case. If we want to buy a coffee with bitcoin, sure 1$ is astronomical.
But to store wealth safely 1$ now and then is a big joke. (It certainly never in history was so cheap to store wealth so securely).
So different use cases need/demand different tx fees, somehow we have to find the right one. Also technical improvements in many ways can reduce fees or for example LN could make a total different usage of the chain which again changes the fee structure totally.

Only to realize a bull run later what bitcoin is all about and how stupid they were. Most people have been there somewhere in all the bitcoin cycles though. But bitcoin will proof everyone who doesn't understand bitcoin wrong.
Than another funny thing happens, are they going to acknowledge that they were wrong (like you), and do they get over their own arrogance and buy in. Or do they double down and go full retard on bitcoin (like Nouriel Roubini).

There is none.


Not so likely as it seems that many exchanges walk hand in hand with bcash.


True, it is not.


​If they are honest, sure they should. But as i said, those exchanges who listed bcash are already questionable.


I think the community of bitcoin has to stand up and do something (like is now the case with wright going mental). The scam that Ver and that whole community are pulling isn't any better. Exchanges should turn, we the people should fight it. The market itself is so manipulated that they wouldn't let it bleed, there stakes are too high (those guys/companies will go bankrupt).
@_date: 2019-04-10 13:43:41
Yes it does hurt the USD, as that is the only function it has.
So less places to spent mean less uses which means less people are wanting/going to hold dollars.
But that's the difference between a dollar and a bitcoin. Bitcoin you can hold to store value (as the characteristics of bitcoin will very likely keep its value or even increasing it) and a dollars only function is that you can spent it without losing too much value over time.

Sure you can rebuy stock if that is possible at the broker. It still doesn't make a real difference though. Some of the best stocks never paid a penny of dividend in their life time. In stocks it is all about compounding.

I'm living in the Netherlands and the use of bitcoin is actually very high.
There are websites who accept it, many people know about it, we have the highest node count per capita, there is a lot of infrastructure created (so good for everybody) etc.

What you are getting at doesn't work though. It doesn't matter how many you buy and destroy. Let say you destroyed all but one.

My wealth is already diversified of course. I will re balance it only if it seems right (a extreme low stock market for example). And the likelihood that i will buy new RE is very small. So i think the chances to re balance a lot are not that big. Certainly i will not re balance just for the sake of "diversification".
I already do travel a lot and have no interest in making videos or so. I just meant that if i have enough wealth to never worry about my future it will make it easier to just keep going and also to invest money/time into helping others in need. For now i just want to secure my own future first.

Folex to btc is 0.0000183 .   So you potentially have:
0.0000183 * 1000 = 0.0183 BTC  which is around ~ $95 at the moment.
But the volume at that exchange is super low, so you already need 5 days of trading volume to sell all (so likely you will not get that 95$ for it).
But you can try to sell at least before you fill in those details no?

Bitcoin doesn't stop at layer one. High value trades will be settled on L1 and many more layers can be build on top, currently there is for example a second layer (LN), which worked fine when the network congested last week.
Bitcoin itself it is not private, it is an public ledger. It is pseudonymous and if done correctly we might use LN anonymous.


Yes, that can be done. The thing is that you can look backwards or forwards in the transaction history. So eventually with enough data you can start to connect the dots. That is why bitcoin isn't really anonymous.

Not coinbase is the problem but your bank. They are holding the dollars. Call your bank and tell them to fuck off with their bad practices. (They probably just hold on to YOUR money for some free interest in the meantime, or for keeping up enough on the  "balance" for fractional lending).
If i send euros to Coinbase it arrives in 2-3 hours and i can send the bitcoin directly.

Yes totally agree. 100k$ is reachable and 10k$ a day is also not so unthinkable anymore. Crazy time in front of us if we think about it.
Bitcoin indeed will slowly absorb the wealth of those inflationary currencies and replacing eur/usd fiat by doing so. No wonder as it is a much better option.

Warren Buffett on selling: "The best holding period is forever."
The thing is that selling might be tempting but selling in itself is rather useless. You get more fiat, but fiat in itself loses money. So if you can't get back into bitcoin nor find another good asset you basically doing the wrong thing.
Probably the best thing to do is just do some diversification from time to time. If you really think bitcoin might be in the end of a bull market maybe you can sell some to buy real estate or stocks.
Just have enough fiat, some stock, some real estate maybe, some gold/silver. Invest a bit of money in improving your house to have lower bills.
But in general selling a hard/or earning asset just for the sake of being priced high at the moment is a rather bad decision.

All banks here in my country charge a foreign cash withdrawal fee (if the currency is not euro) which for me is 5$ each time. Besides the 5$ fee there is a 1.1% up mark above the exchange rate from Mastercard, which of course also goes to the bank.
Besides that i pay a monthly fee to have the account open of around 2$, which once again all banks do charge.
My creditcard cost me 25$ a year and of course no charge backs either. Seems like i am really getting f\*cked here lol.
But anyway, we pay less at the stores, because all those "discounts" you get are paid by the companies you buy from. So basically it isn't much difference of course.

DCA is a better strategy then to buy at a random number let say 15k. (Many should now understand this valuable lesson).
Besides that i think many "investors" who bought at the wrong time already sold at a loss.
But in general i do think people have the wrong approach to investing, the biggest returns you get just in a couple of days. So to get the full return you need to always be in the market, otherwise you easily miss out on those.
What is your ultimate goal for investing? It is best to have long time horizons (pension for example). In that way you are not so worried about periods of under performance (actually it is in those times that you should be happy and buy what you can).
@_date: 2019-04-20 10:58:17


That is hardly where bitcoin gets it value from those days. Sure people could use it for this, but how many really do so? I know not that many. Besides it is still inconvinient. Money from bank to exchange (sign up) &gt; buy bitcoin &gt; send bitcoin &gt; exchange money to fiat (sign up 2nd party) &gt; exchange to bank.
Sure it is a cheap and fast option in some cases. But for most it is still too complicated and too much trouble with exchanges etc.. All the bank transfers abroad and services like WU are still booming as always.
Bitcoin imo is used for a bigger part as a better money, a SoV. Something which they can hardly ever kill as the chances they are going to suddenly behave themselves and create a better money system are like zero.

To be honest it is pretty amazing how many people in bitcoin really believe in it. (Like how Warren Buffett just always believes the market will go up eventually). 
Because it shows it is not a fat, like the tulip for example. Everyone liked tulips until everyone woke up and realized it is just a flower. In the end it is all about trust, if enough people keep believing in it there will be a turning point. Were all sellers are out and only buyers are left and price goes up once again.

Bitcoin is a system out of their hands. So as more and more people will believe in bitcoin it will create a higher price. The higher the price the more valuable the system becomes (making it running an infinite loop). If my wealth is outside of a bank/savings account and into a bitcoin ledger which they can't manipulate the lose control over me.
In this way if many humans believe in the same way that bitcoin has value (not physically like gold, but much like fiat but now with cryptography backing it). In this case there is reasons to argue that bitcoin has value as it is very secure, low inflationary and it has a maximum limited supply. So the bigger bitcoin grows the less power (central) banks and governments will eventually have.

Mainly it is bullshit. Some of the parties you are referring too have enough cash in the bank to buy up all bitcoins at today's prices.
If those institutions are really interested and let say 'only' put a 1% stake in bitcoin the price will go through the roof.

If it were very big bitcoin wouldn't be at this level right now. Some of those institutions have more cash on the balance than bitcoin is worth. So theoretically they can buy up whole bitcoin at today's spot price. (Yes it is not possible i do understand that).

So the unit 1 Bitcoin you can keep braking down till infinity. Where as a inflationary currency would just have endless zeros before the denominator, bitcoin can have them behind as well. Only difference that that one bitcoin keeps having value but 1 penny has zero value left those days.
On LN they already shown Sub satoshi i think it was 1/100 of a Satoshi.

As a college student the money in short term might be word a lot to you. Or not as you probably can do some side job or project anyway.
Or you can invest like 20$ and learn a lot from the book "the bitcoin standard". It will give you a good basic understanding about money etc, hardly a miss for 20$.
@_date: 2018-11-12 21:51:26
I don't know which governments or bonds you look at but i can't find any good ones (actually i am not even looking, i dumped my bonds some time ago). 
I do think bitcoin is here to stay, blockchain and crypto in general means very little. Would i ever trust a random alt coin to put money in and transact? Very unlikely, will i put money in bitcoin and sleep like a baby at night? Yes for sure.
Commerce on it self means nothing. I use all kinds of payment options and different tokens/currencies and whatnot. 
Creating a way to do payments can be valuable but isn't the genius invention we are seeing in bitcoin.
And for the people who think its too risky for them, they should just put in 20-50$ and see how risky it really is. Not investing is way more risky than investing in a well thought/diversified portfolio.

Yes if i deduct 5k cash i would have the hardest time and the need to know all kind of information.
My daily cash limit is only 1k. To disclose i live in one rich western country and my bank is very solid. That doesn't change any of the fact. Search the internet of the many stories you don't want to believe.
But it is okay, if you can withdrawal 20k cash and have no issues good for you. Hope you can even do this in times of crises while others can deduct only 100$ a day, so you can provide them with some cash.
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:30:58
It shows that we are still very early.
Yes by now people have heard of it, but that's about it. They don't understand the slightest about it yet. For sure most people don't trust it yet and have a hard time to gasp even just the idea that they can store something valuable inside some code. 
While basically they trust banks to do exactly the same and they have no problem with that. But if it is in a bank account they imagine how the real cash looks/feels like.
I think most of those people only really start to get into it when they have no other choice. If ATM's only spit out 100$ a day while B ATM's can do thousands someone might start to see it. If year after year your fiat money loses value while bitcoin keeps rising slowly but steadily. 
The risk of not having any bitcoin (small bits can be enough) will ever increase. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 14:33:26
Cuz i say so.
No look at fiat and its ever increasing money supply (need to be increased otherwise that ponzi will implode quickly). And now look at bitcoin. It's very secure, low inflated, border-less,  no government, no (central) bankers involved to keep it running. A pretty decent asset imo.

Pretty cool that there was already a future market back then. Although i think it might have been invented at that period of time. (Not really sure though).
But even after the crash some rich guys actually did pay insane amounts for tulips (the real bulbs). As they just liked them that much. And maybe hoped a little bit that the hype would come back maybe.

@_date: 2018-11-16 09:46:15
Yea it is a very strange thing.
But somehow there is this kind of feeling safety around fiat. To be honest i also had it for a long time. But now it is like year 7 or something that interest in my country is below 0.5% and it is already for long even below 0.05%. But we have a 1.2% capital tax and roughly 2% inflation. So although real interest isn't negative yet, the effective rate is like 3% negative. Yet money flow is ever decreasing and people just keep saving more and more. There is something like 350$ Billion in cash on bank accounts. ~ 20k per citizen.
I think people do understand they need money for the future. But they only feel safe by saving this money in banks, while basically they only burn money as it makes no sense at this point in time. 
But humans and logic's is often far apart from each other :)
@_date: 2018-11-09 09:52:05
It is true though.

That's why many investors did exactly the opposite? You know those ones with big names and big companies? If you know what you are doing it aint a gamble.
The only problem with that is that most "investors" need to protect them from themselves. They think they know it all but have barely a fair understanding, then go all in and that would end badly.
@_date: 2018-11-02 09:51:07
I hope you do understand that bitcoin is still very volatile. So your revenue which you got by accepting bitcoin or other crypto might be halved in that time period. But also doubled.
Probably for you the most easy way is just tell your customers that you accept it. (Stickers etc). And then calculate at current prices for when someone wants to make a purchase. And give the person a QR code to send the coins to your wallet. There are different apps and whatnot, you have to find something which works for you.
You might want to look into it how to handle it with taxes/administration (if you are intent to do that).
Also when you find some products you like just try them out, you can send very low amounts of bitcoin just to try and understand it better. Buy/sell bitcoin at one of the major exchanges (coinbase, kraken, bitstamp) or at a local exchange in your country.

Deflation or inflation has little to do with spending.
You really think i am not buying that phone or not going about because of those reasons? Or not booking a holiday this year because next year it might be 1 day more holidays? Or like i should spend now $1000 because next year it is only $980, just spent it to spent it??
If i can spent bitcoin somewhere i do, what do you think i can't just buy bitcoin back with my dollars? I rather have the pseudonymous tx from bitcoin instead of being tracked by bankers/gov into oblivion.
Another way to look at it. USD is used heavily across the globe as "safe heaven". If you live in xx (Argentina for example) with a 20% inflation in local currency you rather keep it in dollars. So there you loose only 2% a year. But that is 2% which America steals from poor people around the world. How would that Argentinian make his choice when he can choice between an "okish" 2% loss or a very secure and widely accepted 10% increase? So what if more people start to do it? The USD will fall harder and harder and they are less likely to steal money successfully while bitcoin is raising in price and becoming more and more attractive. 
@_date: 2018-11-05 21:41:38

I had never heard of the beanie baby bubble or beanie babies. Had to google it haha.


Exactly and that can not really happen with bitcoin. Even with something like gold, if the price rises to 3.000$ an ounce suddenly more people will start to mine gold and mining which wasn't profitable before becomes profitable. So mining supply will start to increase and its unlikely that the gold demand will keep up with that.
That's why i don't really think bitcoin can be compared with other bubbles. Bitcoin bubble is more like an new adoption cycle. Every cycle new people get attracted, some come for the quick money. New people will start to look into it, some stay even after the crash. Than slowly the market start to stabilize and rinse and repeat. At least one/two more such cycles will happen i think in the next decade.
Look at December, yes we were in a bubble and bitcoin did x20 last year. But we are still up like x7 since January 17. Not that bad for a bubble huh? 
@_date: 2018-11-12 23:52:57

Than they should buy a hardware wallet.
You can't serve everybody. In my country we use internet banking for 15+ years now. Still there are people who can't (don't want) to use it. But the whole infrastructure is now build on internet banking, without it you don't really matter anymore. You really want to keep a bank building open for those two 80 year olds and a stubborn 40 year old who can't/don't want to adjust?
Not gonna happen. Same as there are daily ads about phishing, that you shouldn't give your bank details, don't reply on emails. Don't ever give details on the phone. And yet everyday millions of euros are getting phished. There is no limit on stupidity and as long as you don't put people in control they will always find a way to lose it anyway.
Somethings are just not meant for everyone. Its the same with stocks, real estate, private businesses and thousands of other products.
Look how many people in the crypto space itself can't even explain cleary why/what is bitcoin (for). They just hope on some tremendous gains on the next bitcoin shitcoin. Even those people don't understand let alone be there to adoption.

I don't know man. It is pretty hard to predict such future.
In one way 150k is extreme high value. And maybe not sustainable, like it was in December last year. On the other way bitcoin is like one big Self-fulfilling prophecy machine. Where a higher price means more safety (miners profit more from the reward so invest more in mining and mining machine R&amp;D). People will trust it more as the value rises even more and more people get attracted by the gains. Governments can't disagree it existence as it is getting too valuable. People start to use it more as a SoV. More people start to accept it as medium of exchange.
It goes on and on, all things which only will improve the system. Like how suddenly internet became main stream. Or mobile phones or social media. Suddenly everyone has it.
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:43:34
So how in this case it isn't bad? It means that businesses or whatever have send actual products to Italy and Spain and are now waiting for aprox a Trillion euro.
If a financial crisis start you really expect that 1T to come back to NL and DE?
The industries were late paying is standard often get hit hard in a financial crisis like the last. As they have major cashflow problems, they can't borrow short term anymore so they can't continue producing and if one party in the whole industry start to fall it will domino across the rest (until the gov/cb intervenes basically). 
I get your point that basically everything is "okay". But it rarely ever is. If someone always have 5 creditcards open and just pays the debt in time at the last allowed paydate. He keeps rolling forward his obligations. So basically nothing is wrong. Until he can't pay the interest anymore (very likely in a crisis), so he defaults on all 5.

Indeed. But it is just an easy target to get political agendas and opinions pointed in a direction.
Mark my words on how paying with cash money also becomes targeted as something only criminals do. Actually i can already see that agenda being pushed through in western Europe.
With digital transactions (on their system) they can track us indefinably, they have ever more control on us and "our" money. Now the max they cut pull off was a zero interest on savings. If your money is locked in they can easily pull a -3% interest just to keep your money "safely" in the bank. You can go nowhere expect for going into risky assets.
@_date: 2018-11-16 10:07:44


Definitely agree to this.
I'm not sure how old you are. But it is a pretty safe bet that most of your live you can enjoy this journey. 
The real game play will start to begin when bigger parties start to join the table. You think USAmerica will give up easily? Or BIS? Or big banks? The attacks who are still coming will make those forks and current media fud look like a bad joke.
But i do think in the end you will find other purpose than bitcoin no? You can start to use your hopefully big capital to do something good for the world. Find a new passion into something and make that your next journey :)

He just knows things which most people don't see or failed to understand. Even his "bet" against Goldman perfectly demonstrate that.
He is a businessman but not a dictator who only pushes through his vision like other parties for sure try to do so. If bitcoin doesn't fail he wouldn't be angry or frustrated.
Look how he changes his mind on tech and adapted in many industries. He sucked up his mistakes and agreed he was wrong pretty often. But many people in the crypto space are just in it for the wrong reasons. So no wonder that a conservative investor as WB is against it. Not because it will hurt his business but because it will hurt the average "investor" in crypto.

Yes, i do think the same. But there will be another big bull run like in 2017 at least one more time imo (maybe not as many x but anyway surprising most people). It is still early and not that widespread. Yes people now know about bitcoin but that doesn't mean they buy it. If i look at myself i knew it years before i actually bought it. Granted that i didn't need bitcoin as much as some people in worse of states.
Localbitcoin shows bitcoin trading numbers already start to increase to record levels in many of the countries you expect. It shows that people slowly start to buy it for the right reason.

There are people sitting in ivy towers ripping people off on a massive scale. They find new ways to do so daily. They gamble with the pensions of hard working people. They sell them crappy products no one really understands. 
And once in a while the whole thing goes the wrong way and they ask for tax money (again those hard workers) to bail them out.
No one goes to jail, all the salaries and bonuses can be kept, maybe some business expense will be charged in the form of a "fine" and the beauty of it all is that they just right away go and make it 3x worse than the last time.

I'm not sure speculation is a more realistic description of bitcoin.
But then again, its hard to say anything logic about this new asset class. Some current people in power would see it rather today than tomorrow burning in hell and bring us the regular FUD. While many others believe we are building a very reliable and more fair future.
Also how you threat any investment already differs a lot. A person who goes 100% all in one just one thing is more likely speculating than investing. While holding 1% of your portfolio into bitcoin is imo a perfectly reasonable investment approach.

Of course he profit from the system how it is, that is were he bet his whole life and wealth on. He made his wealth in that way too. Don't shoot the messenger.
You really think he is threatened a little bit by bitcoin? Serious? You think bitcoin will prevent people from buying coke? Flying with airplanes? Buying Apple products? Even if bitcoin will be major his business and underlying businesses will adapt. 
Of course the banking/insurance part of Berkshire might become less profitable or even perish at a certain point in time. But such holding companies will thrive on the new technology.

If you shop around the offers of their creditcard/debit card aren't that bad. You get pretty much value for money.
Spending money abroad in every remote village as 1% is a pretty good service to me. They haven't really let me down often.
It's the banks behind those cards full of bad services and practices.

Not saying that bitcoin can't or will go lower. I don't believe in any such fictional TA lines which are giving any "support" while you need to sell it when it gets below that. It is ridiculous. Its like buying a house for 200k. But your neighbor now sells for 190k so you also will start to sell. Of course people fall for that and TA fan boys trade on that. 
I'm not even sure if those parties are buying. It is a speculative suggestion. I know in Holland one of Europe's biggest market maker has pointed out that they will start going into bitcoin even though the regulators has highly given negative advise about that. They just can't leave this market i suppose. Look how George Soros opinion suddenly changed 180 degrees this year.
Look for example at the 90's how many early investors in tech stock got shaken out but institutions just before the biggest bubble started.
Bitcoin is very limited, the mining supply added daily isn't really that much anymore. The same coins keep trading in bitcoin over and over. It isn't hard to see that it would be very difficult for any big player to enter bitcoin in a substantial way and without offsetting the market.
Maybe we will go to 4500$ or whatever level it might reach. But to many it wouldn't really matter that much, last weak hands will be shaken out and it just might take longer before the new appreciation is starting. Nothing wrong with that, it means that the tech has more time evolve.

Many December buyers have been sold off long ago. The ones who still sell at their old levels can easily do it. If we go that high again the new buying pressure most likely easily out weight those sellers. We might hang at those levels for a while and maybe have some temporary selling pressure of those people. But they will awake from a second nightmare that is seeing how their initial stack who they hold in the bear market for so long suddenly is valued way higher. Then the panic once again, not sure if they buy it back thought. But it clearly will show that they have no idea what they are doing.

It is being developed like that no? LN for example? More tech and infrastructure is being created everyday.
But the main part of a currency to work is stability (it can't really be stable yet as it is way to small for a real currency, so the mcap has to grow first). And if something has a store of value people start to trust it.
Look for example how currency went from full back gold currency to paper un-backed currency while most people still think it has value. The only value fiat currencies have those days is trust.
Although maybe un-logical, most big fiat have still way more trust than that bitcoin has in peoples minds. Slowly we will see that going to change over the next decade or two.

And even if finex has all dolars in banks, but do have bank problems and the market don't really trust it you see it go down a lot (market demands a risk premium).

That doesn't necessarily make it going to happen anytime soon. Yes the market is high, many things are wrong. Yet it can go muh higher.


Just look back at the last 30 years on the stock market. If you have a decent spread portfolio in the stock market that is most likely your best bet in the long term. Add some bitcoin as a hedge against it and you would be pretty well off imo.
There are not really many places to hide, all assets around the world are pumped up. Fiats are shit but kind of stable in short term (at least the big names). Gold is a bet as central banks own the biggest part and they don't really want you to own it, so low returns can be expected if there is not a kind of reset or something.
If you really start to build a hedge there is always a counter party risk. Look at the last crisis how things which where supposed to be good suddenly had nothing to show for. Bitcoin might be a good option in that case but it hasn't had any real crisis/recession so pretty hard to say anything about that yet.
Thanks to humans and central banks we are pretty much in an everything bubble and nowhere to hide.

The market cap of T is like 1.6% of bitcoin. It is a nothing burger.
So bypass those exchanges, they can/will get in problem maybe. (As you could already have seen when the tether parity was gone a couple weeks ago). Bitcoin performed pretty fine while a couple of those exchanges started to show their first weaknesses. Enough bitcoin is being traded on exchanges with fiat gateways to supports it market pretty fine. Those exchanges mainly get used to buy/trade shitcoins anyway.
If tether is gone the worst think that happens is that arbitrage is done in a worse way. But this also offers opportunities, so it doesn't really matter either.

In the grand scheme of things yes, that is an important factor what bitcoin makes unique.

Yea it is hard to be certain now of something that happened 400 years ago. I think there has been many studies. Some wrong information and some correct information (collections afterwards) are taken into account. I think when the bubble bursted it took like one week to known that fact countrywide, some exchanges in other cities after the market crashes were still made.

Paypal should charge between 3-4% tops no? Aah actually exchange rate at Paypal is really horrendous. Interesting if bitcoin ATM's actually can be cheaper then the paypal route!

So who controls the price?
@_date: 2018-11-08 09:46:43
Yes you could. But you just burns through your money. Meanwhile the fees (some) are paying increases. Not sure it has anything to do with volatility. (If you mean price volatility, transaction fee may bounce indeed).
Here is some insight of the transaction fees, how fees and unconfirmed transactions move daily.
Back to your original question, yes transactions are and stay visible. But you don't necessarily knows who made the transaction. Here is some cool address from a bitcoin puzzle:
Someone put in 310 BTC in this wallet and a couple weeks later someone successfully completed the puzzle (he got access to the private keys by puzzling). So he send out this bitcoin with 3 transactions of 103.33~ bitcoin each. You can follow the transaction further if you want.

Deflation or inflation has little to do with spending.
You really think i am not buying that phone or not going about because of those reasons? Or not booking a holiday this year because next year it might be 1 day more holidays? Or like i should spend now $1000 because next year it is only $980, just spent it to spent it??
If i can spent bitcoin somewhere i do, what do you think i can't just buy bitcoin back with my dollars? I rather have the pseudonymous tx from bitcoin instead of being tracked by bankers/gov into oblivion.
@_date: 2018-11-01 09:07:28
Wow, you just heavily discounted bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-11-09 16:25:25
Send with sepa and you don't have this problem. From bank to my own wallet can take like 3 hours with a sepa transaction.

I'm not sure which country does officially have the euro but is not included in Sepa?
Anyway, i think if there are enough people who are willing to buy bitcoin is is definitely worth the afford. In my country 17 million people i know 3 exchanges on top of my mind who are just operating locally (we do have easy access to all the top exchanges though).
So with few competitors you are likely to have a good market.

@_date: 2018-11-10 09:50:08
Once again it has to do with your bank.
A sepa transaction to coinbase gets transfers in +/- 3 hours. After that you are free to buy and send btc around how you would like.
Your bank isn't really transferring money right away. The settlement date lays way in the future, hence coinbase not really giving you access as they want to see some real money coming in first.
Please find a better bank, maybe transferwise could do the job? They have a sepa payment system i suppose.
@_date: 2018-11-19 10:21:44

Tell me 3 things which are similar in opportunity and benefit.


Not really, the internet has changed many lives in many ways and it changed businesses too.


If bitcoin can survive by itself the people will come eventually. It may take years for people to fully trust it and see the real advantages, but very likely they will see it. People around the world in all kinds of ways are pushed to bitcoin. Think about being able to bank at all, high fees in traditional banking, low cost and easily send abroad, against inflation, against bank defaults, against central bankers, against bad politicians.
@_date: 2019-01-24 21:59:50

Maybe bitcoin isn't for you indeed.
Oh and about those price predictions/thoughts. If it is in bitcoin or stock or whatever. If you ever want to make another one, just think about how people make price predictions on a professional level, they get paid tons to do so. And you know what? 
Can i tell you a little secret? Even they have no clue what they are talking about. If you really think that those predictions have any meaning, buy some financial product to bet on it. And bank big time on your vision. But if those pro's were really as good as they think they are the would sit with a never ending pina colada supple on some tropical island.

With banking it would take more hassle to even make the transaction. It would take days if not weeks to make its round trip. And probably around 80$ in fees.

Some great minds out there might have never heard or cared about bitcoin yet. Many economist and the like think we are building a ponzi or something, they still have no clue.

I meant not the Roman empire, but the golden age approx 1500 years later. Although the Roman and Greek empires were also pretty impressive for that time. Gold might not have been perfect. But it was very stable, across borders you could easily do commerce as all countries around were run by the same system and had the same measures. There weren't big boom/ bust cycles every few years because of our current money interventions. It was very stable for many decades in a row. People were prospering in living standards, there was much art/paintings made in that time, look at the houses across old Europe, many inventions are from that time period we still use today. The idea that we need an (high) inflationary money to get the economy going is just stupid and for sure not the only or might be even best solution.


Wow your far off as you can be with this one. Indeed debt may increase it a bit, but to put all credit of our civilized world to debt is crazy!

You remember when the government tried to shut down downloading?
They can't successfully do anything like shutting down bitcoin payments and atm's. If they do that there will be a new infrastructure in no tie which is 10 times harder to attack and totally out of their hands. They know this very well.
Germany called for a system outside of swift to start a competitor (so that such bans can be prevented). In Europe there is a banking system called SEPA, actually if i read stories about USD transfers everyday it is easily to conclude that this system already works way better anyway. So probably they just build on that to make it more acceptable for world wide trading. (For which now swift is being used).
@_date: 2018-11-11 11:37:36
That's why you don't compare just money. Although Holland would been one of the best examples for just comparing money as it has a decent long term history. 
But you can compare canal houses too, so you can make a decent adjustment. Besides that their is loads of information about other materials priced at xx amount.
Still not perfect but not far from a government inflation calculate bureau nowadays.
In general house prices become more expensive in the last part of the century indeed. But that doesn't mean that those canal houses aren't good data. I think those houses are the best data example you can find around the world.

Exactly. But no surprise, "charities" put 10-90% of what they earn back in their own country for doing business or marketing. So of course you only hear of those companies (It's not even a charity to me).
I hope internet will one day break this traditional media, but to be honest i don't see much difference, yes more people now realize how bad media is. But most are still all to eager to hear it.
For example i yesterday saw an article of the Netherlands state news outlet that Coinbase was "hacked". The "journalist" couldn't or wouldn't understand that it was ETC and not Coinbase..

Yes that works for 1m$ dollar.
You can't buy Billions of $ worth of bitcoin without being unnoticed. You think people don't talk? You think the open ledger doesn't show billions are on the move?
You talk about institutional money that is big money and in the end they need to disclose it in their financial reports too. Have you seen any report beside bitmain with big holdings? You expect next report from Goldman to show up with a 1mil stack of bitcoin?
I get that you want it, but it is pretty unlikely that (many) institutions has bought a significant stake.

Less risky? Look maybe how many burned themselves on those metals. I get your points but PM is sketchy af imo. Look how much paper gold there is. How JP Morgan and consortium are shorting silver so heavily that they control the whole market.
After reading "the bitcoin standard" i became less of a silver fan. Silver is not really a precious metal anymore. It is used in industry and for bullion. But it isn't even really mined anymore (by product in other mines), as soon as the price doubles/triples whatever, it becomes interesting to mine silver and it heavily suppresses the market price. The days of a poor mans gold are likely over, at least as long as the current system is in place.

Debt going out of control and so undermining the value of the USD which means assets priced in USD will go up. So an asset like bitcoin could be valued higher. A higher value means a renewed interest in bitcoin. A new cycle resulting in a new boom. Making bitcoin holders wealthy and at the same time USD holders poorer. Letting more people wonder about how bad the USD is. Resulting in a more robust bitcoin. Making the chances of bitcoin become the number 1 SoV ever more likely.

Yes i also was surprised Americans still use checks. I haven't touched one since i have internet banking since like 15 years ago...
I don't know when maybe 15-20 years ago our government/central bank demanded that a bank may hold the money only like maximum for 24 hours on a week day. Basically it became illegal to hold clients money (to seek interest in those couple of days of transit).
I think sepa took that as design as well. In the EU they now for the first time talk about making transactions directly. As they start to feel the threat of bitcoin/crypto. So we have accomplished something and it shows that it is always good to have real competitors in any space.

If you look at alts in general i feel its still overhyped/overvalued. But i think that is part of the bitcoin market. If bitcoin starts to rise again they again take a free ride (or at least many of them). 
I think its like part of human nature. If you look at the tech bubble a lot of money is wasted too. Many investors have gone broke while such successful industry was born. But that money is used in a way to create the basis for the successful industry it is today.

Of course, especially under the fiat system where central banks pump in a lot of liquidity and suddenly try to slow down the economy with rising interest rates.
But the fact that everyone does now think that a recession is coming makes it unlikely. It is priced in the market and you should always be contrarian (although that is very hard of course). Most likely the market will boom until some kind new and unexpected trigger hits the next bust.

@_date: 2019-01-08 13:48:37
- Mining fee will play a more important role for bitcoin's security in time.
- The price itself isn't affected that much by halving anymore, the coinbase rate is now so low that most coins are already out there, so they create the market price and miners have to suck it up
- 51% attacks are argued in length b4, read into that.
- Don't forget that we know this cycle already many years in advance, so we can calculate/build on top of those logic's. Your banks interest could next month be totally different due to central banks fickleness.

It also just depends on your viewpoint. 
I do think that bitcoin is a perfect example of going over the 2/5/10% bets you do once in a lifetime. It is a super unique opportunity, yes i know even while writing it sounds like everyone would say that about everything.
But lets be honest, look how tech and later internet changed the world. Now we combine technological hardware with internet and security and try to replace central banks, banks, fiat currencies, inflationairy debt ponzi schemes.
If you read enough and think about the current system it is even hard not to go all in. (I wouldn't but i for sure am over my 5% i normally invest in something).

That is the idea that LN can do a lot of tx without settling on chain.


That LN is used for low valued fast transaction which need less security. If tomorrow you will send 100k$ and buy a coffee. Will you do both transactions exactly in the same manner and with the same care?
@_date: 2019-01-07 09:21:10
It is pretty safe probably.
But the beauty of bitcoin is that you can just store it yourself. You have to do some research to do that more safely than Coinbase though.
Both storing bitcoin on exchanges and by yourself involves risks, it has been gone wrong countless of times. But nowadays with hardware wallets it isn't super difficult anymore to do it pretty safely. But you have to have basic understand and not fall for phishing attempts, etc.
@_date: 2019-01-29 22:15:55
You might wanne start here:
In this talk Saifedean explains a bit the difference between the layers:
 (Very interesting talk).
LN is working for what, almost a year now? And on chain transactions are reaches near all time high even in the bear market.  As long as fees on chain don't sky rocket people keep using on chain pretty much all the time. And also LN is used way more. So basically tx for both only are increasing, not decreasing.
And when fees start to rise again (inevitable imo over the long run), on chain will be used for settlement (LN) and other settlements. But those transaction values are very high and it doesn't matter that it do cost a high(er) fee.
I don't know what the limit will be or ought to be. To be honest i don't care about that so much, its technology which can/will adapt but it takes time.
But lets assume just something here. Lets say the max is 5k$. This means that indeed most of your transactions can go over LN. Your coffee break, shopping, a pizza etc. But once in a while you sent money abroad or you put it in your savings account. So you uses onchain tx for that purpose.
While you and i may not spent that much money that often. In financial institutes those amounts and pretty common.

There was an article earlier posted about difference between all sorts of value (gold, silver, fiat printing, fiat digital banking etc).

Fiat online systems by far used the most energy of all.

Most likely it will but firstly there is likely a run on liquid cash (dollars mainly). So like gold bitcoin will also suffer a hit. But likely when things are settled bitcoin will rise.
I know few places in the world to hide assets better than in bitcoin. Smart money will find its way sooner rather than later.

They get fines for all kind of laws the broke, the list is too long to repeat it here.
But do explain please, why money printing helps the fractional reserve system (banks need to hold a specific amount of savings in ratio to their debts).
And secondly, you do know that banks did brake those minimum reserve levels in the last crisis (which was a major problem for the system) right?

Lol. Don't put more money into banks than your willing to lose.
But you can make a good indication of the bank is having a decent fractional reserve ratio (not too much exposure to debt). That it is not doing "funny business" with your money, something they are pretty notorious for doing since uhmm centuries.
That they can really deliver you your savings in times of need. No Greek/ Cyprus/ Iceland kind of situation..

For it to be money it has to have a SoV first.
No one is going to use an asset as money which bounces up 20x and down 80% in a year.
Bitcoin can and might be really used as money in the future. Some actually should/could use it right now (Venezuela, etc). But the west who has a pretty stable currency better uses fiat for spending for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:50:03

@_date: 2019-01-06 22:12:25
It is a mixture of course.
Let say you can get your hands on the Google source code and just copy it. That doesn't make you ThomasGoogle. The infrastructure/netwerk effect will stay with Google and it is the same counts for bitcoin.
The code is important though, but it isn't easily reproducible (its a feature not a bug), because now you can look into the code and even work yourself on the code to make it even better!
Yes you are right about the virtuous circle and that will continue further. Now it all look pretty dark with current state of the market, but in the next bull run the idea will be spread way further. Slowly but surely also new people will start to put trust into bitcoin (wallstreet, investors, high new worth etc). That will increase the virus even way deeper into society.

Because it is a future and not real money...
If you can add supply by creating futures, why a potato farmer would not just sell futures instead of doing all the hard work?
If you have 1000 potatoes and 10 future contracts you have more than the total supply, what is so hard to understand about it? The farmer would buy futures to protect his business, the speculator would supply this by trying to profit from it. Nothing wrong with both as they function in their own way and help each other to deliver a better end result. (farmer gets less profit but more certainty and doesn't go bust when potato prices fall, investor/speculator tries to make a buck).
And yet the supply is still 1000 potatoes, where you see more supply created? No one is buying future contracts with the idea that they really own a bitcoin, zero people! 
With fake paper gold contracts people really think they own gold while they don't. They bought gold through an ETF or another vehicle selling in reality paper fake gold "as good as the real gold". 
The difference here is that the future contract tries to solve (and does so) a problem why the latter one is just a ripoff.

Big capital is unlikely to do so. I think most real investors (stock/bond) are still looking at bitcoin as a speculative toy and don't understand the slightest of it. They all just know that it had major gains (so they think they missed it) and don't see it (yet) as a hedge against stock/world of finance.

It will be real interesting to watch as banks can't really give out a lot (not enough liquidity).
But there are likely enough rules in place (withdrawal limits online, atm daily limits, etc) to not give away that much money.

As gold can barely keep up with the inflation. Look for the past hundred year of performance between inflation, gold and stock. Stock always outperform gold so it is a pretty useless compared to buying an index (super easy those days). You even need to put in fiat money to protect those gold bars. It doesn't bring you anything valuable in return, even if you hodled it for 2000 years.

But you clearly have much understanding on how the financial world works, so i give up this pissing contest.
One scenario though to give you some other perspective than 50 euro ATM withdrawal by stupid people blablabla.  On a friday afternoon in the heat of the last crisis Kazachstan gave ABN AMbro a dutch bank a call that it is pulling out 5 BILLION euro. Just with that one call from one account the bank basically became illiquid and had to be taken over by the state.

It is better in the sense that you stop supporting the abusive system.
For example in the Netherlands i get 0.03% interest on my bank account. Meanwhile the bank is still raking in big amounts. While they aren't really guaranteeing my own deposits.

Bitcoin will not be stable for decades though. Getting away of the old system and adopting to this new system will take decades for people to get it and get accustomed to it.

@_date: 2019-01-06 14:08:47
Correct, hence bitcoin is so wonderful. 
It is useful in many ways (and many more ways can be invented/added). 
And its its current code makes it soon more scarce than gold on inflationary aspect and unlike gold with bitcoin even the total supply ever available is already known.
@_date: 2019-01-27 23:23:19
And how/why would the market of trade totally stop?
The bitcoin reward (coinbase) decreases over time. That is true, aprox every 4 year it halves until it becomes zero in ~2140.
But besides this there is a fee from the transactions. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 23:17:58
Why they would do that?
What that has to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-01-22 09:25:12
Yes it is out there and working: 
There are different kind of wallets which offer you already LN. This one for example: 
It is still being further developed with new things to come. But basically you can install that app, open a channel (with an on chain tx). You then can use the qr code or paste ln invoices to pay with bitcoin over LN, it is amazingly fast!  Here is an example of people using LN all the time:   You can draw something, submit it and it gives you an invoice. If you scan that invoice in few seconds your drawing will be online.
If you then have receiving capacity in your channel you could also give out invoices and receive back satoshis in your LN wallet.

Yes, i agree with that. But still it is hardly any better. Now we are in the calm waters. Although Deutche Bank is still a major problem. But as soon as things start to go south things become messy real quick.
Remember how in the last crisis American banks were "solvent" as they told to the SEC or whatever entity who was trying to understand the market. And just over the weekend they suddenly didn't have any money and had major problems.
Next (financial) crisis will be worse than the last one. And it will be harder to "fix" it.

Even that is questionable though. Look for example at paper gold/silver. Or at how central banks themselves lend out gold to suppress its price. Okay they not really "print" it, but they raise the fake paper supply which the world agrees on that it is "as good as gold".
So they can at the same time print fiat money and keep gold as uninteresting investment.

Within EU mainly as banks outside it are still living in the stone age.
Hence why exchanges open accounts at banks in the EU. So let say an American sends money to Coinbase and it takes him 14 days (as not Coinbase, but the banks are withholding the tx for interest, which is illegal practice in the EU). While for me it takes 2-3 hours to do a EUR SEPA tx on a businessday.

It is exactly what bitcoin does. There just has to be only 1 bitcoin available (while the rest is holded) and still the world economy could work on that one bitcoin.
What you looking at is inflation which makes people buy useless stuff and work extra hard to pay for this useless stuff, meanwhile third parties (banks, central banks, governments) are freeloading on that system. And you justify it as growth of GDP or economy. 
But does it bring any real value to human mankind. If i start to buy every year a new iPhone, do i really conduct some real value to the world??
Its almost painful to read it. But go buy some ticket around the world. And you will quickly see that the countries with the lowest inflation rates actually have the highest output, savings, wealth, standards of living. How you would explain that?

If i compare Dutch social "gettos" to gettos in America or France i chose our social gettos. So although it aint perfect it aint the nightmare many foresee anyway. To advance as an society it just cost money to drag everybody along, it doesn't matter in which way you pay for it. In some way we all get presented the bill anyway. Getting everybody onboard in a human way would be the smoothest ride imo.
Yes true, those reductions would unload a huge pressure and makes things better. But basically that's how we sustain our current system so that is unlikely too.

In Electrum for example you have multiple addresses under one HD wallet. So you can send 0.1 btc to 10 addresses, then send in one transaction 1 BTC out. Now those 0.1 * 10 will be send together to one address.

Not sure that would be the best description. Keeping your wealth in line with the purchasing power or making a (small) gain is perfectly normal and not directly speculation in itself.

Don't you worry kid, play with your toys!
You have to rely on yourself unfortunately. But luckily there is internet with all the information you will ever need! Mining probably is not a good idea for you though.
Do you know someone older who wants/can give you bitcoin for just cash? Maybe a nephew or a friend. localbitcoin.com or bisq. But i am not sure if there is an age limit. Or maybe you can buy at such place under a certain dollar amount.
In the Netherlands/Belgium you can buy at bitonic.nl i'm pretty sure they only verify your online payment (so you need to have that) and they do not do any further checks. Try to find an exchange in your region who allows it.
Or talk to a wise family member (uncle/aunt etc).
Don't deprive yourself of those investments. Even if you lose all your money you will learn a lot from it! Find your way to do it!

Today's standard is that people in poor high inflation countries hold USD as safe heaven. And it works pretty well as their own currency inflates way harder so if your currency inflates at 20% a year and usd "only" at 2% in local terms you did pretty well.
But if you can do better, let say bitcoin just stays flat, you even gained another 2% (not even talking about the real up sight of bitcoin).
Slowly more and more people will realize how America is inflating and stealing from the rest of the world. People buy bitcoin &gt; Bitcoin price rises &gt; People notice bitcoin rises &gt; rinse and repeat. Slowly it gains more trust and value.

I'm not sure in your case buying bitcoin is the best use of your 200 euros.
Bitcoin indeed has a good chance to see a yet higher top. But do understand that it may take years (or never happen and going straight to zero...). 
200 Euro worth of bitcoin might be okay to hold in the hands of Revolut, but if it rises are you then still feeling okay to hold it at their account?
The less easy but better way would be using coinbase/bitstamp and eventually creating a wallet and sending it their.

Not even trust, i think most people 999 out of a 1000 can't even describe how the system is build/working. So we are even further removed from adoption in that way.
Insiders do speak out regularly though:  
But i think most people just trust it regardless, quiet frankly there is still not a good replacement. Bitcoin is still to early to function both as a Fiat and as a SoV.

Yes, in the book "currency wars" the author talks about Ice9 events if i not mistaken. Basically since the last crisis the government has pro actively changed the system to get much faster/bigger control over the financial system. There the author written how the government can freeze your and everyone else bank account (of course) but it goes much further for example as to not allowing pension funds to be able to move funds.
The problem is that if the government blocks the withdrawals things get out of hand real quick. Basically the same problem as a normal bank run. One bank run aint a problem, but if trust is lost in 1 bank the fear spread to the next, to the neighbor country and before you know it this fear went around the whole world.

He just explained how the government insured minimums are a fraud. There is no money nor a plan to really give you 100k in the end, but only to let customers think that their money is safu (like you). So this guarantee is in place only so that there is no bank run. A protection for themselves, not to help/protect the public.

You are not going to sell undervalued assets when the banker is doing some margin calls?
My point is that many sellers is rough times don't sell because of logic's but just out of need. Very nice bitcoin is undervalued, but if a banker or debt collector calls or you simply have a stack of bills people gonna dump that shit into oblivion. 
Anyway though it is best to take into account multiple scenarios. Indeed the bear market has been rough and took out most selling pressure already.

For example in Europe we went from (in my country) Gulden to Euro.
Firstly they changed it digitally on the bank/stockmarket. Those changed, had a duo listening prior to the switch.
Later on there was a fixed datum for the currency switch. So companies list 1 apple is 2 gulden and/or 1 euro. Until like 6-18 months later to totally drop the old currency.
If bitcoin succeeds to become very valuable and stable naturally people will start to take in more bitcoin than fiat currency. (For example look in some touristic countries with poor financial stability where they charge you 100 euro/dollar for doing x instead of their local currency).

@_date: 2019-01-24 22:09:52
I take that you haven't read "the bitcoin standard" yet? Do it, its a great read!
We want our money to be really our money and to be REAL. Most of us sell fiat to get out of the sickening (central) bank/fiat/fractional reserve system. Let that sink in for a while. Its not about the fastest transactions, the most transactions per second, the most widespread availability to use it. Bitcoin is the most secure and censorship resistant payment method out there. This comes with a price.
Bitcoin has multiple layers though and can have more layers on top if needed. So the top layer is the most secure layer and is not super fast, not necessarily cheap to use. But for example the LN is cheap and very fast and has a way bigger throughput. So what you say about some newer coin isn't true. Bitcoin will be the most trustable coin, so using LN will be way preferred above some vague new coin (there are thousands by now, would you trust those)? (For example, your fiat payments online are directly or almost directly, but the settlement of those transactions can take days, or weeks in case of USAmerica).
I don understand your references to other technologies, but i don't think it is valid here. We are building a new money system. (With a major part of it being the best Store of Value you can only dream of). Any money system if it is gold based, fiat based or some weird sticks/shells is build on trust. If bitcoin would fail my trust for blockchains will be near zero most likely. As long as bitcoin wouldn't fail in some weird way (which is less likely 10 years in), bitcoin will remain out there and exactly that is making is very trustable and preferred above any other (shit)coin.

No it doesn't.
If you want it is there for you, but if you don't want it we will not send American soldiers to force you. If you don't understand it no problem either, we could inform you or you can just stay in the dark.
Your points you made are there because of security reasons. One could buy bitcoin on an exchange and leave them. One could buy an bitcoin etf and leave the security over to others. But what makes bitcoin great is that you can take your own control over your money. No withdrawal limits, hidden tax (inflation), no bankers making the rules in backrooms, no government who can just take it all, if done right no way to take/hack it in any way.

You meant they are 4500 blocks ahead? I meant it in another way. Even if they somehow got the control of bitcoin, they crashed it and burned it through the ground. Nothing is stopping a second Satoshi to just use the copy of the source code. Make some adjustments and re-release it again. 
Technically i don't know how far bitcoin can keep being safe from an attack. There must be some point that bitcoin can break theoretically. (With all resources/knowledge available).
To be honest i am a bit surprised that they didn't try it. Maybe they really didn't see it coming and thought they would FUD it away or something. But it made me bullish af as i am over the fact that it can be controlled/damaged.  Yes this is really a big problem, and it is at the moment just about to start. Imagine if some central banker/powerful person really start to use bitcoin as a tool.

You can distinct two things. The supply might be inflationary and the price deflationary.
Meaning: that the coins who are still being mined indeed cause a (small) inflation. Even when it is well known it might indeed still have a small effect. But due to the fact that soon the inflation rate of the supply is less then most currencies and is around gold makes it hardly a flaw.
But bitcoin is deflationary as instead of a decreasing purchasing power it is and will be increasing for the foreseeable future.

It might actually happen indeed. Although i might also not wish for that as i have no idea if that would be any good either.
Even if let say the dollar and bitcoin become very stable it is hard to see that it will ever be/stay like that, as even if that pair might find its price point, many other countries will keep having higher demand for bitcoin as for usd.
It's more likely than that at some point trust in fiat will be totally lost and it will hyper inflate against bitcoin. But such scenarios are decades away imo.

True, such events have a negative effect and many lose trust. But it doesn't kill bitcoin. Gox didn't the next such event for sure wouldn't. It is capitalism at is finest actually a market which corrects it self. I wish we did this with our financial institutions, instead of making things way worse in the long run.
Have you heard Draper talk about this? He liked btc before Gox and thought it was really something. Then gox happened and he thought it was over, instead he saw how Gox didn't kill it and true holders kept determined. Than he really knew he was onto something big.
People will get slaughtered by btc, by hackers, by bad parties (Bcashers for example), they will hate it, they will lose all their life savings. But in the end bitcoin will keep blocks pushing out every ten minutes and the world in a broader sense will need/want it 100% sure.

Most likely LN is just a fast/easy way to do payments. So for now it isn't much incentive beside us nerds/maximalist. Who like to play around with this stuff. 
Although LN could have some real world usages already, but still very limited and early.
Firstly i still do believe that bitcoin needs to get in another stage to reach bigger/better utility. When bitcoins become really valuable (and so it basically means trusted by us), people will start to save money into bitcoin. (Like you can already seen on a very small case in countries like Venezuela and other failed states/currencies).
Over time bitcoin will work as kind of a big black hole, suckering in more money/trust. By that time bitcoin will become much more stable. When the purchase value of one bitcoin doesnt go from x20 to -80% in a year or two but let say 5% or maybe even 2%. It basically becomes a better money than any fiat currency on the world.
At that stage, besides collecting/saving bitcoin you can start to spent bitcoin. Because you are just too lazy to even convert it to those other shitcoins (fiats). At that time LN will be used and is ready to be used as a major platform to do commerce with.
This whole thing plays out over decades and still has major issues and unknowns. Interesting times and it can be mind boggling from time to time.

Not true. You just check first of January of your investment gained or lost value (dollarwise) and on paper you made a profit or a loss for that year, simple as that. It doesn't matter if you rather want dollar, a business, gold, bitcoin or stock. You just made a poor or a good investment for that year.


That is kind of true indeed. But not necessarily bad.
But do you even know what opportunity cost means? 
I'm not saying though that your approach to bitcoin or investing is wrong. Holding bitcoin imo is also good and from now on i am not likely to fully sell all my bitcoin ever again (so yes i will get paper losses for which i don't care). But just arguing with your thought that a loss is only a loss when you sell it. The IRS might agree with you though, but in investing you normally look per year what your gains are.
If your whole goals is just to own 1 bitcoin and keep it regardless of the dollar price. That's fine! 
@_date: 2019-01-03 09:51:32
No wonder it "stopped growing" as we basically started the year in a low.
You seriously can't understand that cycles not run smoothly in 1 year periods? You see all this data and you think, that's it. The last year low was in december, so in 2019 we have a lower low. It's over now, from 4 to 3200$ was a wild ride, but its done. The end.

No, i think bitcoin will become the preferred SoV for the whole world. Which is much needed and will reduce conflicts. It will create a more trust able system were we can really rely and build our future on.
Money will eventually flow out of the housing market and the gold market into bitcoin. Bitcoins economics are almost too good to be true. It's such a well thought of technology that it is a bit scary and overwhelming. 
I get that you look at it in your way and see bitcoin as a payment processor. And i agree, fiat cash or even digital cash will be outperforming bitcoin for the far foreseeable future. If you do think that is bitcoins main selling point you really have to think it over.
I bet that you haven't read the book "The Bitcoin Standard" ? I highly recommend you to read it, its worth it even when you don't care much about bitcoin! It will explain exactly the view which to me seems your missing right now.

He of all persons knows that technology moves slowly and changes don't happen overnight.
The bitcoin boom/bust cycles are the way how it is getting adopted. At the end of the boom cycle it sparks the attention of many new people (who not nearly invest in it). If they see then years later that price x20 they know something is up and they start to research it better. 
But the line between a greater fool investment or a solid investment i do think is rather thin. On one hand i can agree it is a greater fool investment, but then what is not? It the end it comes all down to trust. And let bitcoin be the most trusted system humans ever seen.

Indeed based on historical data it is a small chance we will live in caves any time soon. Historical data also shows that the most strong money wins. In most periods it was gold. Sometimes an oppressor forced its citizens a currency (often if not always fiat based), sometimes we had a currency based on gold. But in the end the hardest currency always wins and gold was needed to settled disputes.
Today we are totally off the gold standard and it is not likely we will ever go back there, with modern technology and in our current world something like bitcoin is actually much better than gold. Although for many it is still unbelievable for now and few really understand it/can vision it. It is very likely that we entered yet again a new technological revolution and this time we enter the world of digital gold. But not just gold, a magic token on which you can put a lot more structures than just hodl for its SoV.
Looking back at the historical data, bitcoin functioned pretty well as a SoV by its deffinition: "a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.", needless to say, it was the best one out there in its entire history by a long shot and created even more purchasing power.
Let the history repeat itself and give us another boom/bust cycle!

Because it is unique in many ways. You can't just copy something and think that will be the same. They even tried it and they have part of the infrastructure (website domains, infrastructure, social media) and yet it is b-cash and not bitcoin. In my opinion it has zero value and the matter of fact that there are dozens of those bitcoins around with zero value kind of proves that.
That the code is open source and everyone can copy it and look into it isn't a bug, its a future. If you think you can do better, copy that it, fork the shit out of it and prove me wrong. I'm 100% sure that you can't accomplish that though...
But Netscape is far from the same as bitcoin, but i don't think i can convince you. But you will see how people will naturally flow into bitcoin in the next decades. (I was also skeptical at first).

And that makes it better than bitcoin? It doesn't holds its value, history has shown it countless of times. It can also collapse 20+% i mere days. Look just at the EUR/USD rate and see how stable those currencies really are. I still don't know why you prefer becoming worth less over becoming worth more.
You really going to buy more chips now if you know that you can eat less of it next year? Or you really going to stop eating chips because next year you could buy 1.05 bag instead of today one bag? You really believe in that? That 1-4% difference is really making you do things which you wouldn't do otherwise?
I have a saving account which gives below 0.5% since the last 10 year. To be honest i haven't felt any extra urge to suddenly start spending that money. I actually lose money on it as the inflation rate + capital tax of 1.3% eat it away. But you know what, isn't it ridiculous that this money get stolen from me while at the same time they try to inflate the market with extra printed money to pump up my stocks and house price?
Why it has to be like that and how that suddenly is the only way humans keep going forward? I'm not saying it aint good and maybe it is the best system who knows? But you are acting like it is the only system. Although history shows that many other systems also just worked fine for periods of time in the past.

@_date: 2019-01-27 16:02:00
I try to explain it briefly. (not really correct but just to get a broad idea).
The wealth tax is 30%, they make an assumption of how much you can "earn" on the money. So they say you can make around 4% per year on your capital (indeed stocks, cash, money accounts, savings, second house etc). So 30% tax on 4% income = ~ 1.2% per year on your capital.
There are a lot of things to say about this way of taxing. But for me it is pretty convenient as it takes away a whole big tax burden as you don't have to calculate realized profits as under a capital gain tax. Yes some might actually be taxes more (1.2% tax while you get 0.03% interest is a bitch).
But on the other hand, if you make 1000% returns on bitcoin you still pay the yearly 1.2%.
@_date: 2019-01-03 13:37:50

You seriously seeking regulation to make things good? Gold needed regulation of the last 5000 years? Now with the "regulations" they fucked up even gold. Look for example at the paper gold to real gold ratio. 
The power to consumers with no 3rth party is indeed the end goal but i also do understand that that is unlikely. For now CB can be a bridge between banks and self served.
To be honest i kind of believe in self regulating pretty much. Did bitcoin die after gox? Did we came out stronger? Have many learned there lesson? Now think about the financial crisis of 08. Are we now any better off? Have we learned anything? Did we reduce the debt? Did we jail the criminals? I can go on but i guess you get the point.
CB have to stay honest to bitcoin, otherwise another party will take over. Everyone can withdrawal their coins in &lt;30 minutes. No one needs coinbase really, some might use it as convenience, for some it might be better (the chances that cb fucking up for them might be lower than they fuck up themselves).

I can bring a horse to water but i can't make him drink.
To be honest really i don't think i can argue with you about it, its set in your mind this way.


I agree with this, bitcoin at this moment is more an investment than a currency. It can be used for both but at the moment the investment opportunity/part is way bigger. Although if i want a more anonymous way of paying (then creditcard/debitcard) bitcoin actually already is offering me some good alternative.  To second that, bitcoin is also already a better way to make payments internationally. I don't know if you ever used paypal or an international wire transaction. But if so you can see my point i suppose.
But bitcoins volatility makes it less good for now.


I hope the world is going to skip some iPhone 2-4-6-8 and use the perfectly working product a little longer than just buying a new for the idea that they just need to consume. I really hope more people will do so and purchases will be done with thought instead of in the way we have been doing it the last decades.

No it will not.
If bitcoin will be past the whole idea of having bitcoin in the first place can thrown away.
Because what is the point of a precious metal like gold if we decide every few years to put our trust in a new one? The idea of bitcoin is that it can last forever.

In hindsight i should have sold anything possible when i came across bitcoin and should have gone all in. (Even after 2017 i would still be very happy).
But we can't invest in hindsight unfortunately.
For example, many will cash out on the next bull run at or around there previous buys or the last time ATH. Only to totally miss the next big run. You have to be in it to win it.


It is a bubble who popped indeed. But unlike tulips or ico's bitcoin will just stay around in a dark alley until the interest in bitcoin start to light a fire again. This is actually a powerful feature of bitcoin which will mind blow people away. People notice bitcoin ATH at sometimes. Than they see it crash (they think aha! i told you i was right about bitcoin being a ponzi blablabla), but then it rises a 10x above the point were they saw it last time going wrong. At that point something likely changed in there minds.

Yes, so now we give subsidies only to the happy few (many actually), so those people are looked at negatively. Why not just distribute a standard amount of cash to everyone, so that everyone has a base line and those we don't want to work will not work anymore. (If you don't want to work your real attribution to the market is anyway very low). And not all those people are even needed to the labor force anymore anyway. 
Unwanted jobs get automatized. Look for example to the difference between Norway and USA. Because Norway has a very high minimum wage. Which causes for many jobs just to get terminated, because a machine/robot could do the same job and became a cheaper option. You really demand for people just to work to prevent them from being lazy while basically their work isn't needed in 2019 anymore?

I read once that trading banks do give their (new) employers 100k$ trading account with fake and fun money just to play around with. To test and understand more about trading, like a trial account at some brokers. But in reality they do trade real money on it as those traders are fearless (they think no real money is involved). The results are way better than when they trade for "real" money.

I think they burned through a lot of money by now. And if not money all their goodwill from their "legit" businesses is gone. 
A very costly endeavor after all. But the good thing is that if those projects fail it means that basically it is impossible to fork bitcoin. So it is like a new chapter for bitcoin where forking doesn't make sense anymore.

Me not as i already stopped doing most unnecessarily spending's for a long time  :)

@_date: 2019-01-10 14:09:35
But on their small balances there are big liabilities based on (mortgages, loans, etc). The bank has to stay solvent in strict ways. They can help each other a bit or the central bank could, but it is limited of course.
If for example a France person is buying 100€ worth of bitcoin, the French bank ends up with -100. If i sold it my bank in another country will have +100€ but my bank would not (necessarily) agree any such liabilities from the French bank of course. If too much capital flows away from certain banks/countries they become insolvent. And due to the fact that the capital requirement ratios are very very low it can happen really quickly.
If you think we don't trust each other. Add this times three and you will get on the level of how banks don't trust each other! They all know the game they play and they only think about themselves in the end.

In DK they voted against the introduction of the euro, they started another poll and it was again voted against. And for a while i think it looked like they wanted to re-ask again!

Exactly this. It is funny how people put much importance around those halving's. But the fact that it is known and by now doesn't effect the supply rate majorly makes it likely that it has not much to do with the price. The effect that people think it will have impact probably already has way more impact on the price.
The fact that bitcoin is volatile and it is getting more adopted, makes it much more likely that bitcoin is going through boom/bust cycles who create every time bigger acknowledgement by itself. Halvings have not really much to do with it imo.
@_date: 2019-01-02 12:08:48

You talk about supply, so adding real bitcoins to the circulation. As i told a future is something totally different than that. It is just a trust system and making prices based on future price predictions.

First off bitcoin not crypto. 
We are the bears and bulls indeed. The market fluctuates so wildly as it is hard to put a price to this totally new asset class. Human psychology is a bitch though, even with buying assets like stocks and Real Estate we are often very wrong.
If you look at the chart from a longer time horizon you can clearly notice that it aint all so bad, even for just 2 years back we are still up x3 (a huge ROI). Bitcoin is new and people don't know how to value it (yet), so there is a wild difference between hodlers who want to see way higher prices and believe in it and all the millions of people who are still at zero and have no idea yet what bitcoin can/will do for them.
Until we get in some more clearer water we keep cycling through those short term boom/bust phases.

As a customer you pay the fees indirectly (most don't think they pay). Booking.com controls the market and before it wasn't even allowed to go lower than the price on booking.com (not sure it that policy is still allowed).
Of course if it would really be cheaper they have something. But Booking.com has million + locations for sale, they have a decent website, the customer base is huge, customer care sucks pretty much though, but they do have a very strong monopoly.

I must say i read a lot about stock investing and really dived deep into it. At the moment i do throw away some rules of investing (diversification for example) and really bet big on bitcoin.
Normally i like to do value investing but as the prices are sky rocketing there isn't much after the central banks released the QE beast.
Bitcoin i do honestly think is a life changing investment not seen in a very long time. If things go right (and until now it looks really positive) we not only create a censorship resistant money (much needed Anno 2019), but also a better gold and a ledger technology which can create a whole new revolution. The ideas we now have right now which can run on top of the bitcoin are still very limited much like a tip of an iceberg.
Only thing that does concern me is the people we attack directly are so powerful and cruel that we are in for a long nasty fight...

For most people who do not live in a harsh regime the local fiat currency works pretty well for doing trade. But that is not what bitcoin is after. It isn't competing with paper money nor with digital money. Nor it wants to compete with Mastercard or Paypal.
Bitcoin is a totally new concept where even people in Iran or Venezuela can trade, regardless of what Swift or their own oppressor wants. No one can freeze your assets, it is way harder to track your spending than with traditional payments (except good old cash).
But most of all it fights a whole other battle, it becomes the most trust able system, not only for currency like the dollar (which isn't so reliable as one might think). But also as a Store of Value. The ultimate SoV humans has ever seen! The hard money will ultimately become the currency of choice for everyone (people stop wasting time to trade back to that old shitty fiat and pay with their hard money instead).
Than the cycle is complete. But then again, this process will take multiple decades. First of all it needs to gain major trust (value in fiat terms) for it to get to the next level.

Probably just buy some index or some diversified stocks. Tell her that stocks are priced high right now and you really think it would be a good idea to put 1-5% of the money into bitcoin as you think it will be like 21st century gold.

In Electrum you have to copy the address you find under the tab "receive". With this bitcoin address you can now send bitcoin from Coinbase to Electrum.
On the "history" tab you will then soon see the transaction from Coinbase.
Now you can send the bitcoin at the "send" tab. In this tab you need to fill in the retailers bitcoin address or scan their qr code. You fill in the amount to send, for example 0.0001 btc. And lastly the fee below the amount, You can move that small button to left and right (select 3. sats/byte and Electrum will do the calculations).

Education becomes both less of quality as also less accessible. Think about the student debt rise in the world for example.
And also if i look in my country an education becomes less valuable. Everyone has been educated by the government and walking around with a bachelor. So employers ask bachelors for doing not that difficult work (which for decades has be done by way less educated).

Yes, so that is the point of ubu. The people who aren't really participating right now could still have a decent live under an ubi. They bring value as a consumer but just do not take part as a productive asset (look for example now how just less than half is productive anyway, rest is government workers or government subsidized in some way). Anyway the system kind of "works", an ubi would just be a bit more fair/open that's all.


Fair enough, a very small government could possible bring that. But it is unlikely that we can reduce the government. (Look how businesses can create such cheap products/services indeed, a good example is electronics). But the problem is that it is just not realistic in our current world. There is too big a transition to be going, so an UBI may be step 1.


True, but we need to create a world were everyone can live decent and is best for everyone. I also rather not pay for the syrians next to me, but i also not rather see them build a slum their. If all our citizens do well, we all do.


If you have a very basic income you could decide not to go and work (enslave) yourself through all the regular costs. Instead you could sustain your dream to build a bitcoin for example. Although the upfront cost indeed cost society a lot, it will release and bring a tremendous value of things we haven't ever seen or thought about. Why you think the rich western world brings more value than the 75% of the rest of the world? Because there you don't have to spent 15 hours a day on getting clean water and very basic foods. All that extra time we do have is spent on creating an even better world at an even faster rate.

But you do have to pay capital tax in general. For tax year 2018 they will look at your wealth of 01-01-2018. Besides the first 25k tax free exemption simply said you pay around 1.3% over your capital. (Do understand that is also applies for when you made huge losses for the year).
But looking at your message i get that maybe you already made huge gains? Depending on the country i think you might have to pay on those gains regardless (if you want to honor that at least) ? Netherlands and many other tax offices work together though. So if you "suddenly" have millions in a new country you might trigger some very suspicious activity and get in problems with the new or your old country!

You have "coinbase" inside the current block rewards. That is at this moment 12.5 BTC. And above that there is transaction fees from what we all pay to get in the block.
Over time the reward becomes lower (every four years it halves, next in ~2020 will make it 6.25 BTC per block). So long before the 21 million coins are given out the fees should be most important part for miners.

To be honest buying gold is not that easy. You also need to find a trusted seller (just like finding an exchange). If you buy gold and not check it to be 100% sure that it is real gold you put major trust in the reseller. So you could also trust Coinbase to hold the bitcoin for you.
Surf to Coinbase website &gt; Make account &gt; Verify yourself &gt; Connect bank account and send money &gt; Buy bitcoin &gt; Relax
If you can't do it that way, bitcoin for sure aint for those persons. 
I know, not your keys not your coins. But still an option for people who simply can't protect themselves. They also put major trust in other parties, so the risk is there anyway.

Yes i totally believe this! I have very much the same thoughts and came to bitcoin in the same way. 
The way bitcoin cycles through boom/busts are exactly the way bitcoin will get adopted by an ever increasing number (fueling again and again the cycle).
Indeed if the prices reaches a new ath from the last time you got first introduced to bitcoin something tells you to do a bigger research. Because a x10 in a short time frame isn't normal. But firstly you thought you missed the opportunity. But the second time you missed it while you were just ignorant. Most clever people will then start to search why it exactly goes up and bitcoin sucks them into the rabbit hole.

Yes this could be done easily. In Europe the transistion time was like 6-18 months for most people to adapt. Some keep calculating backwards of course, but with time that becomes a pretty meaningless exercise. 
I do think for example saving will become more attractive in bitcoin than in fiat currencies over the next decade. So slowly it will wake up more people, giving it more credit, waking up more people, etc. From keeping your savings in bitcoin and starting to spent those instead of local currency is a very small/easy step.

If we ever will make money i can't predict of course (i wish i could haha).
But in my opinion it is likely that bitcoin will do well in the long run. It is a much needed product/tool in this crazy debt world.
As for weather to hold, cash out or buy more it is hard to say of course. It depends on the person. For me for example now it is time to invest more into it. I think it is pretty low and although it might not be the true bottom, i'm okay with the current price.
Maybe some should cash out a bit during the bull run to have more cash at hand, but cash burns a way faster than we might think (i made this mistake by not fully invest in stock but just have a too big portion in cash). 
The problem is it is very hard to really know if it bottoms, if the bull run not keep going (in 2017 after a 500% increase it went another x4!) If you think you did well at a 5x you had to wait like a full year to just be back at the price you sold at. And maybe it would have never been that low anymore.
So moral of the story diversify (not in shit altcoin, but in fiat, stock/gold etc). Always take into account multiple scenarios.

\&gt; No maybe not, but those Cent and dollar small savings over a lifetime  add up, the point is Bitcoin is touted as zero fee, or low fee compared  to tradition payment rails. My point is if the people in the ecosystem can’t even be bothered to  lower fees by implementing segwit, and the populous can’t be bothered to  save money where they can, through a Lazy attitude, you’ll find they  will be lazy changing from tradition methods of payment to Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin's main point isn't cheap/free transactions. And how it will ever compete with my free sepa transactions anyway? Sending money around the world right now for a couple of cents is already incredible cheap. 
You need to do approximately 2000 tx right now to just "save" 10$...
Indeed it is very unlikely that lazy people will ever change to bitcoin (if other options will be still available).  A good observation about the human species and you nor bitcoin will change that.
\&gt; That’s not cents on a dollar Buddy, that’s big money, try thinking  outside of the box, you’ll realise laziness equals more cost if the  former has saving benefits. 
Why you bother with other people losing money? And even if so, how much it cost such company to implement/test/program such change? Probably more than you think. Bitcoin is not a enforceable system, people may use it, people may start to use segwit if they like. If not don't become angry, just explain to people the advantages. 
Btw i think segwit adoption is at like 50%?

Actually this is pretty bullish, yes not your keys not your bitcoin. Be your own bank, i know too!
But think about it, so banks are now wanting to start to adopt to bitcoin. Basically this means that they are willing to use this new tool to beat their competitors. All they are doing is helping bitcoin even become bigger and making banks more/faster obsolete.

What if you have a cold seed (wallet, paper, whatever as long as it is real cold).

Why would you send all tx on LN? For example you want to send 10.000$, you really want to use LN for that? Or just a couple of cents on the chain, or maybe even a few dollars.

And that will change later on. But not at those levels..
People all believe in fiat, that is what gives them value at this moment. But slowly more and more people realize that there is nothing good about fiat. If more and more people start to trust in bitcoin (and they will, people always find a hard currency). Than the price fluctuates less and less. The supply is steady and very predictable so that doesn't change its value suddenly neither.
I predict that in let say 100 years bitcoin will be the most stable currency the world has ever seen.

No it doesn't if it cost you to mine 1 bitcoin 25k$, it doesn't make bitcoin scare or valuable by itself.
If you decide not to mine bitcoin the code is still finding blocks every ~10 minutes. Which its coinbase as reward.
The price of bitcoin gives miners the opportunity to spend more on electricity and mining equipment thus making bitcoin more secure.

Banks are run on a fractional reserve system. So that means that your savings are not really in the bank but loaned out to other people (again and again). So between 1-10% of all peoples savings are actually in a bank. Many people know this but anyway trust banks that everything will be right and their savings are safe. Until everyone starts to distrust a bank and a bankrun is started. In a bankrun often (almost always), only the first few can actually receive back their money and often the bank quickly goes bust. Or they make the withdrawal limits so ridiculous as seen in Greek that you can start to stand everyday in line just to get some change money out of your account..
So now it looks like some yellow vests are putting pressure where it hurt the most and starting to withdrawal money from their accounts.
@_date: 2019-01-04 12:01:04
You might wanne look into DCA if you are not sure about when to buy. It is a decent strategy, also it can work well if you don't have a big start capital to begin with.

Many people know that in general many debts are bad. And look were we are in the world, it is one big debt ponzi scheme.
But the better for us i suppose, it only shows that bitcoin still is relative small and only a few people who understand what bitcoin is/does, few risk takers and a decent amount of gamblers are in it.
To be honest, i know pretty decent amount about the financial world, i hope i kind of have a good idea what bitcoin does and still are scared a bit sometimes. So no wonder that most people don't get it yet and listen to FUD or bad news.

I heard of the danger of getting into "deflation" a lot when we went into the last crisis 2007-10. They talked a lot about that deflation is bad for the economy and would threaten peoples lives.
What they actually meant was that the current fiat system can't handle deflation but need an ever increasing money supply to not totally explode. If the money supply stops growing the economy would already be in trouble (see last crisis). But that has nothing to do with actually deflation but everything with how sick this current system is.

OP posted this to show the actual growth year over year based on the lows. It didn't show that now something is wrong because " the yearly low is barely above the one for last year, and it may well go lower still. So that growth pattern based on lows has already become a plateau for 2019."

Yea like how USD has to be the best fiat currency in the world otherwise it would be taken over by competitors right?


Bitcoin is the most trusted system by a long shot, competition is good though. It keeps everyone awake. And in the end it just gobbles up all those competitors features like a big financial black hole.
But it doesn't get taken over, bitcoin as any other system we know of is based on trust. If we stop losing trust it will fail miserably. But a good thing is that humans never lose total faith. Not in fiat, not in gold, not in RE/stock/bonds/whatever. 
It is not a tech play like how Apple or Microsoft is going to win. Bitcoin doesn't have to be the fasted, the most coolest, the most hyped/marketed coin. It has to be the most trustworthy coin. And lets be honest, if bitcoin becomes untrustable the blockchain will melt faster than our North pole.

Its not bullish.
If the price goes down because 1000 BTC gets sold. Or the price goes down because 1000 BTC + 1000 BTC extra from the shorter gets sold. Is it really bullish? Only for those who will still seeking to buy at lower prices it is indeed bullish. In short term the shorts put extra pressure on the price. But in long term it doesn't really matter and might stabilizes the market.

We pay tax on wealth (instead of capital gain tax). So not disclosing any such wealth would be illegal in the first place. It is seen as hiding capital and there are severe punishments on that.

How UBI is a bad thing? In many countries it easily can be financed (for example in the Netherlands there has been made some rough calculations, basically it would cost a little more than current benefit systems but you can just make the system much easier, less fraudulence, and no oversight needed from thousands of Civil servants).
UBI makes shitty jobs harder to fill, so there will be more technological advancements. It give people a less desperate feeling which will increase life and the heath (which reduces cost of a nation). Just to name a few.

Real adoption to bitcoin will not be faster than using internet.

It is pseudonymous mostly. The transactions between addresses you can easily follow through an online explorer. And if your id is connected to the address it is really not anonymous anymore, they can follow all your outgoing transactions connected to you and look for patterns or connect other known addresses. 
If you want to be/stay anonymous you have to do some research.

You need to invest in bitcoin miner(s). You need cheap electricity less then 3 cent per kwh for sure. I'm not sure where you will put the miners, but there can be a higher risk of fire and your insurance not be happy with that if is in your (parents)house.
Just investing/buying bitcoin directly might be a better option. But do your own research and see if it is even possible to mine profitable (it is really only a happy few big players who do this successfully).

Gold isn't likely to skyrocket. And bitcoin already has many times while gold just loses ground.
If something is going to skyrocket it is bitcoin again. Yes physical gold or silver is better but still not ideal. I don't expect that we will ever see total mayhem where your physical coins will be the pricing market over paper/digital markets.

Which means that you need still to be active to survive there.

So there are wallet apps already, guides to setup your own ln node, software to make the payment server, etc.

Next boom will again mind boggle humans mind but will also again "disappoint" those people most likely.

There seems like 0 capital gains so zero tax if you want to use bitcoin for it.
It can be or is really better to use bitcoin. Just explain that to the government, notaries, sales agent, your buyer/seller, your bank, etc.

By knowing that banks are bad but anyway needing to store your "wealth" the fiat money into a bank account.
Let say you have a year worth of cash stored in the bank for cash flow purposes or just as a backup. 
With a click on the button your government or just the (central) bank can get a hold on all of that fiat wealth.

De Achtste Dag - KRONCRV - NPO
A Documentary about the bankruptcy of the bank "Fortis/ABN-Amro".
The financial crisis of 2008 was a turning point during which the complexity of our financial system manifested itself. It was a web we had spun for over for more than thirty years, and which had brought us prosperity, larger houses and widescreen-televisions.
Imdb link:  
Source video:  
Sorry the language is mostly in Dutch and without subtitles, anyways i would like to spread the video! The video is about how the government from the Netherlands put billions of Euro's into this failing, without any good knowledge of what was going on and basically a few head people of the then current government decided to go ahead.
Mere weeks after the capital injection the bank anyway went bankrupt and the government decided to buy up the whole bank/mess. In the video it is shown how the prime minister, head of central banker and minister of finance talk openly about how fragile/bad the system is and they acknowledge with a straight face that they lied at that time for the "public good"..
Short the bankers, long bitcoin!

True. The only thing which gives dollar credits. Is that if it can just keep front running other currencies it keeps in control (thus normal inflation and stable) for quiet a while. Can't really predict how long.
Just look at the FED's current policies and see how a dozens of countries around the world already start falling apart, the US will benefit from that and keeps it strength in that way. It is really sickening, but a very though beast to slay imo.
When foreigners (banks, high net worth, investors, average people) start to prefer bitcoin over dollar than shit hits the fan real quick and hyper inflation is near. It could be years or decades away but the end game is almost certainly written already.

Care to explain further?


What exactly is better? Do you consider that trust less and decentral is a big part of crypto?


American banks sometimes take up to 19 days to settle transactions, look into this sub daily about coinbase complains. Its the banks settling slowly, not CB who is slowly releasing bitcoin.
If you think it is all about speed you don't really understand it well, its not about that, but for that you do have LN now. Which takes about a second to transact, is that fast enough for you?
@_date: 2019-01-21 10:14:56
Yes, it might be not much (do realize that). let say it goes 10x/1000% up, you still "only" get 250$. So as long as you understand that there will be no Lambo's anytime soon from that investment (or like never). Than its okay.
The good thing is that you probably not care if you lose that 25$ completely, so it is not really risky for you. (Don't put more money than you are afford/willing to lose in the first place!).
So 25$ is good if that is what you want, you can buy bitcoin for relatively no fees almost, so you don't waste much on that (if you would buy 25$ on stocks you probably lost all in just transaction fees alone)..
Find a good exchange and try out bitcoin. Install electrum from .org website and create a wallet, send some bitcoin around and see how it all works!
Some quick information about some good sources, its best to do your own research.
 - great videos to give you a good understanding of what bitcoin is. Highly recommend it to watch at least some of his conferences.
The book: "The Bitcoin Standard" from author Saifedean Ammous - it will give you a better understanding of what money is!

They hold it only because your bank doesn't release the funds.
I can wire euro with sepa transaction and the credit is added in 2-3 hours on a business day. At that moment i can buy bitcoin and send it anywhere.
Look into a bank with actually send the money, i think in the EU its even forbidden for a bank to hold onto transactions. But in the states they seem to have stretched this up to 19 days.. Good way to guarantee them some interest/cashflow at your expense.
@_date: 2019-01-14 09:07:02
Likely at first bitcoin will get a big hit, much like gold this in the last one.
Bitcoin is traded a lot with lend money, those positions will be getting closed when money is getting scare. In a crisis cash is king as most go to cash because they are scared or just need the cash to cover debts/losses.
After all is set i do think bitcoin will be used as a hedge/search for safety. 
It really will be an interesting test/proof but at the moment we can't say much about it.

Yes cutting costs should be the go to solution, but even in the most competitive economies there are still some players who majorly benefit more from that system than many (small) players/persons. So making a small adjustment for everyone that at least the binging is more equal isn't going to brake this competitiveness. Clear example is already the tax brakes and progressive tax levels in most countries, they clearly work imo. 


Would work in an utopia kind of world, we are centuries away from that.
Not everyone can't and is needed to be participating. I don't know why you think so. There is always a situation of net payers and net receivers, point me to one system ever in human man kind where it wasn't the case. 
Indeed social tension between people and political parties will reduce under a UBI where people are more equal to each other.

@_date: 2019-01-07 09:29:58
Yes. But to be honest i think you don't really have to actualize it.
If LN is being safe, it means you have big portion of your btc on the chain and a small (spending) portion on the LN network. 
For example the small amounts of money in your wallet you probably never put in a saving account. You get some, you spent some and it just bounces around, same will be for the BTC on the LN network. One of my channels is open now for 6 months i guess. Some i pay some satoshi's and sometimes i receive some. 
If the balance between paying and receiving is good it works actually really well!
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:06:07
Yes, so your exposure to bitcoin is 1 hour. Mine is 24/365. So that's why we have a different idea of stable :)
Nice that you use bitcoin as an utility for escaping those bank monopolies though! Bitcoin has so much functions which people don't even realize/use yet. How much you lose in %/euro wise by doing this? (Without calculating the bitcoin price movement). Fees on exchanges? And you talk about 3%, so normally it cost you 120 euro (to go traditional banking route) ?
Last time i send Norwegian krona from Norway to NL (Eur-sepa) and they charged 31 euro for that. Criminals that they are who can legally steal from you..
I couldn't do it in another way though, they hardly wanted to send my money to my own account anyway.
@_date: 2019-01-07 09:48:14
Businesses will most likely use payment processors.
Or mabye in the near future also exchanges will start to operate LN ? Although i don't see that happen in 1-2 years, but who knows?.
Blockchain because you are still in control. There is a big difference between a bank holding my money and an exchange holding my money. Some say that exchanges are like banks, but i don't agree. With a click on the button someone could transfer the bitcoin to his private wallet if the trust from exchanges are broken.
Where you want to take your fiat money from banks? In gold? In cash? Not going to happen so fiat stays in banks even when people don't trust banks at all (i am and was guilty of this one too)!

Once again it has to do with your bank.
A sepa transaction to coinbase gets transfered in +/- 3 hours. After that you are free to buy and send btc around how you would like it.
Your bank isn't really transferring money right away. The settlement date lays way in the future, hence coinbase not really giving you fully access yet as they want to see some real money coming in first.
Please find a better bank, maybe transferwise could do the job? They have a sepa payment system i suppose.
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:54:20
Fiat money is a strange thing. That (central) banks / government can hold on to this ponzi scheme is pretty admirable.
Of course, in the short term fiat works pretty well (at least those top fiat currencies). They fulfill the promise of transferring value and in short term it is stable.
But people confuse this with long term too. They save money for all kinds of reasons/dreams. But that is a pretty bad way of saving, anyway people have the short term positive feedback of fiat and project it to the long term. Even if they tell stories like aah when i was young that candy bar or can of coke costed only 0.10 usd. And yet they somehow don't really connect the dots fully. They seem like it is just how money is supposed to work.

I forgot who it was but i saw an interview about this from a guy recently. He told this about the '80s that than people had this idea that all our resources are at a finite supply meaning prices rise and can't be delivered enough. Actually the opposite happened, as long as humans put capital/labor to it anything is possible.
If the demand of gold increases the supply will follow, something which can't happen in bitcoin which makes it awesome and way better in the long run.

Almost any investor would look back to the past 150 year in gold/stocks/bonds/houses and expect those returns in some way.
Don't you think looking past boom/busts cycles we can get anywhere from 5-10% on the stock market in the next 50 years?
I do look at the past performance here and expect future results. Just like any money manager, hedge fund, pension fund, insurance company, economist, blablabla.
Although 10 years is still short and especially in the grand scheme of things, this is all that we have for bitcoin. And it does show some clear data, but maybe you are too stubborn/pessimistic to see it.

If you need 50€ order i think 52€ of bitcoin would be fine. You can have about 4% in price difference in the time you make a purchase and have some money for fees. (There might be a bad exchange rate at the retailer, so then you might need more).
Note that Coinbase is paying your first fee. So you only need to pay the fee from Electrum to retailer. If you choose in Electrum about 3 sats/byte it should arrive quickly at the retailer and you just pay a few cents in fee.

Jup and all other financial institutions. (Read currency wars for this, the author describes it pretty well). They have been taking many steps since last crisis.
Also indeed we don't know what will happen to BTC. It can be likely that as gold it first take a big down turn too (Search for liquidity). People sell assets regardless of its hardness. But after that the seek for a safe heaven will begin. It's likely that fresh money will flow into btc (as in gold/usd) and will probably spike up bitcoin quickly.
Unlike in USD and in gold which they always can give an extra liquidity boost to suppress the demand. In bitcoin the coins available to buy will dry up real quick and steer us into a next big bull run (look to the past bull runs to see how too few coins available for buying end up in major gains in price).

Actually i even have no idea if it gets shipped? Last time i saw how Ukrainian gold was "taken" from Ukraine by IMF and i think that went on a plane. But i now look and Venezuela has a pretty big stack of gold.
Most likely it aint logistic problems but the problems to get their hands on all that gold in the first place. As it was just "temporarily" lend out. So now they need somehow to get their hands back on the gold.
Germany had also much difficulty when they requested back their gold.

You think people are not trying that every day for already many years consecutive? It is 900.000 BTC that is $3.600.000.000 laying up for "grasps". 
Even if coinbase gets hacked, you really think they then can just wire out all the bitcoin? 
If you don't trust Coinbase can do it. How you will see a bitcoin ETF holding the coins secure? Or a Bakkt, or whatever?
I understand your point, bitcoin shouldn't be on an exchange. We should all learn the many (difficult) ways to protect ourselves. But it is just a fact that not everyone can. And not everyone want to. Some will rely on 3rth party services. Some will lose their money because of hacks or whatever, but bitcoin will not go away, it will only get stronger and even those services will evolve and be more secure too.

Pretty much, in many countries this is a pretty neat scheme. Basically they need to work their butts off for paying rents or their own house (mortgage/upkeep etc). In many countries the government controls the supply (giving out new building licensees). If you keep the housing market tight, it means that people pay high prices for buying a house. But it also result in high rent prices. 
But they basically got you by the balls as most want to live on themselves and start a family etc so have not really a choice.

So wash trading bots are putting the price down? Lol...
@_date: 2019-01-28 09:49:40
Not really.
By now there fit more transactions in a block. So this means you get more small fees in the same block. There are still more technical improvements going on to make even more transactions in a block. If the bitcoin itself becomes more valuable this means that the total dollar amount of fees and the coinbase also still increase (dollar wise).
Lastly bitcoin blockchain indeed will have higher transaction fees. Do you really care to pay 10$ to move 1 million dollar? Or 10 million? I guess not. So the main layer becomes a layer of settlement (big transactions), while 2nd, 3rth or how many layers below the most normal transactions will take place.
For example:
1 Person sends 1 million for 10$ fee = 10 dollar fee.  (As you asked about SoV, spending 10$ for a SoV model isn't that bad no?)
1 million people can spent 0.00001$ fee (mining fee by opening/ closing channels) by sending 1$ each with LN and also rake in 10 dollars in fee in total.
So here you got two total different transactions which both justify the fee for the miners. How it exactly going to role out is still a big guessing game of course. 10 Years ago we didn't have bitcoin and now we are here. 20 Years ago internet hardly was out there. It will be almost scary to look out in the next 10 year.

I know that citizens sometimes pay less than foreigners/tourist. Sometimes its up to 10x the price (which in any case is just ridiculous). But i haven't really seen price discrimination for EU citizens itself. But this might not really fall under that, i might have overreacted especially if its just 100eur.
Although i think NL is suing Germany at this moment as they want to make a road tax per km but giving their citizens tax advantages back (so letting foreigners picking up a higher bill). Don't know the ins and outs from it though, it might be more complicated :)
And tax systems are never fair, always there are some people taking huge advantages and others paying the price (unknowingly often). If you can pay less i support you :) I think in many (almost all) cases tax money is not spent correctly, compared to many businesses most countries do a very shitty job to say it nicely.

The thing is that all other currencies do the same (or more likely even worse). So in that sense the USD isn't that "bad". Because for example today the ECB is still printing money and buying bad debt papers of the south of Europe to both inflate its money supply and try to stabilize the eu zone (not let interest on debt go out of wack in countries who clearly need a higher interest level).
Some argue that gold is there to protect you. But is it really? Central banks of those countries hold the majority of gold and they allow banks like JP morgan to basically scam the market year after year. So they control the price (As they hold the gold but they don't want their citizens to hold the gold but rather their worthless paper money).
Bitcoin might be the true answer to this, who knows.

There are few options to make your search much smaller. Do you want to accept bitcoin and it gets converted to usd (or your local fiat) directly? If so search for BTC pay to do it yourself or 3rd party intermediaries like Coingate.
Or do you want to keep the coins for a while and sell at your own pace? Than a simple bitcoin wallet to receive the coins might be enough. There are also simple websites/templates to ask the customer billing.
To give an idea what is possible (they accept bitcoin by Lightning Network):
I think they have realized it open source.

No i do not really have one. As the maker will know the solution. 
But it is very unfair to suddenly end your own puzzle. Especially to those puzzle makers who make the puzzle as kind of promotion to their business or in a way to profit from it. They keep the prize + the profit made from the puzzle. That's just a bad con job, who says there is a solution in the first place? (That one puzzle guy didn't have one at all).

Yahoo Finance is indeed doing that.
No they will not invest in crypto (or at least not in the tokens). You want as an owner of such company that the ceo start slashing cash into some weird high risk asset class?
Will they invest in tech behind it if they legally can do so? Likely, if they see a future in it and can make a profit from it.
@_date: 2018-11-09 11:39:56
Yes it could.
For example real estate. Many people with loads of money buy houses in cities like Amsterdam, London and the like. Not because they really like the houses nor that the really want to be in the RE business. But it is the easiest way to store wealth and likely keep most of it (except some buyers at the top who need to sell too soon).
Even if you buy not that good RE sooner or later those markets get overheaded and you can dump that house easily on the market for a quick profit. As local people still need to live somewhere and building new houses most often lag the demand. Which keep prices rising forever as the local government is way more incentiviezed to keep the current market stable (giving out too few housing permits). If you can keep in general more demand than inventory the prices keep kind of stable.
But if let say bitcoin becomes the number one storage in the future. It has very low monetary inflation. Next halving less than most big currencies do have. So it is likely that there also will be an increasing and continuously demand for it. Let say its calculated at 5% profit year over year. While for example a house would return you 6%. Would you really go through all the hassle for buying a house (abroad) if you can just buy an extreme high amount of bitcoin out of your lazy chair in a couple of minutes?
This will put then downward pressure on housing market and upward pressure on bitcoin. And it becomes like a self fulfilling prophecy.

Easy credit would not exist in a pure bitcoin economy.  I think where you have to get your information is to look at how the system worked in Europe under a gold standard. (That is i think the closest thing to how you can find historical data to support this idea).

If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking.
Any fyi you can't just take historic data from bitcoin and expect it to do the same again. To get the same kind of returns the inflow of money also need to have some kind of similarity. To get to 400B takes a whole different approach then to reach 10T (more than gold by the way).

Definitely true. To be honest i knew about bitcoin for a long time. But only after the last bubble i started to take it very serious. I do now think that those boom/bust cyclces in bitcoin are actually big adoption cycles. Every boom new people get into it and start to understand it better. In the bust some of those people start to buy in massively taking away those coins from the market and bitcoin gets spread more across humans. Still few people actually own bitcoin and fewer have a clear picture of what bitcoin is and what it will bring.

It is not as big as you think. The idea that you think like this is a bigger effect than all miners together will ever reach. There are thousands who think like you, if they all act in the same way (to hold and wait for supply to decrease), that effect will be a tremendous times stronger.

I think there can be a use of multiple ways. Some trust Coinbase or for example ETFs enough and others can take their own control. The two can be together as long as bitcoin not falls into control of one party.
As CB or other parties don't act at the best interest of the users people will know it quickly enough and take out everything.
If we can keep the internet reasonable free and time passes bitcoin keeps getting more traction. More and more people realize how wrong the current system is and now there is a way out.

"The max channel size is 16 million satoshis." 
So 0.16 BTC * 3500$ = maximum 560$. 
So to send today $ 200k, you need a bitcoin valued at 1,250,000 $
And what is the point to open a channel for 16 mill satoshi, (on chain transaction), to send all the satoshis in one transaction as you like so much to do valued transaction, and then to close the channel (on chain transaction). Seems rather useless as you can just send it directly on chain the first time.

Exactly, hence my call for it to be a ponzi. In a normal free market people would build houses when there is demand, prices will fall, houses stop being build, prices rice.

I can't really afford to spend my fiat at an loss neither can you?
Example: When i entered adulthood i had to pay health insurance for the first time. Back than it costed 60$ a month, i had the money so it wasn't really a problem. I had actually more money so i saved it for later. Now 10 years into the future the money is still in my account. But unfortunately something fishy went on as my health insurance coverage became worse, i haven't started earning that much more, the interest over those 10 years are near zero (minus if i do calculate the capital tax of around 1.3%). But you know what? Now suddenly my insurance asks me 120$ per month!
What can i do, what can i do?

Yes you are correct! Even the borrowing system with fiat (where they can and do print money) doesn't work at all. Why else they need all the fixes, printing and tweaking the system every now and then.
At least for the far foreseeable future BTC should not be used for loans. There are already failed attempts in doing this with BTC.

Unlike maybe you and your country, other people are financially healthy. Only in my country there is about 350 billion usd parked on saving accounts. World wide there are still trillions of usd in savings accounts, what do you think will happen when fiats starts to fail? Do you think a couple of people like you with bad financial planning who need to pay the bills will be make the difference instead of the big wave of money who will seek safety?
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:11:16
True, it happened before too. The difference with the US is that you can return the key and finish the debt as far as i know? Here we have a personal liability. Let say the bank fore closed the house with a 50k loss, this means that your house is gone and you have a personal debt with the bank of 50k. So after the last crisis for people who lost their job they also lost their house and put trowed in the debt whole.
I think this time it will be worse, as last time the printing press just saved everyone's asses in the end.

Actually holding is a good thing. It means there is real value in the item they do hold. Look for example at fiat money, in general people want to get rid of it because of inflation, it is a bad thing to hold fiat over a longer period of time. Now look when hyperinflation starts to kick in, this means everyone wants to get rid of their fiat in half a day or less.
Holders show that there is a real value and it doesn't matter for the system to trade if Bitcoin is actually worth $1 or $1 million each. If you want to make a trade for example for a dinner, does it really matter for you to pay 10 Bitcoin for a meal or you pay 1000 Satoshi? Trading does work under both conditions. 
If you are really bothered just by the fact that 1% own everything i can only say this. Let say we reset everything, the whole system will be reset, from houses to bank accounts. Everyone gets $1k, do you think in 5 years everyone has still equal amounts?
Bitcoin will not solve this kind of problem yet. This will be only possible in some futuristic world for which we are not ready by a long shot. Were people work only to bring value to the world, were they don't need to work for food/assets/resources/shelter. (in my view basic income might be a good starting point for that, but we are drifting off topic).

In my opinion it has to be bitcoin, if now a new project starts whichs will be the main coin there is no reason that there will not be a better coin in 1,5 or 50 years. 
Alt markets were in a bubble driven by green and speculation (like you just showed yourself too), i think many coins will never reach there previous ATH. The new money that will flow in will come from institutions and investors, they will not throw in any money in shitcoins but all only will pump it into bitcoin and maybe another high valued project. 
Yes it was nice you earned some extra bitcoin by investing in Verge, but what are the chances it will happen again? Many stocks from the tech bubble went to zero and only a few stayed alive and became the well know companies of today.

I rather see someone using bitcoin out of necessity or as it is the cheapest option. Or as an alternative payment method in any place. 
Not a gamble website who is advertising to sell unknowing people fake bitcoin CFDs.

Find an exchange in your country or one which you can easily connect with.
You can buy just 0.0001 bitcoin or just for 10$. You don't have to buy a whole one.

"Fraud: In law, fraud is deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain" 
So you would say that in the open source crypto systems there is no fraud?
@_date: 2018-07-11 07:16:50
True, that makes me worried a bit though. As it clearly shown that it is not the best solution for everyone. Most people like (need) a kind of backup, some service they rely on. It needs to be fool proof, now it is to complicated/scared/opaque for most people.
A Custodian might be needed not only for professional money but also for the average people's money. (I know it is not what it supposed to be).

@_date: 2018-07-29 16:42:18
True for now, altough at the moment LN is meant for small transactions. So one bigger transaction result in many small ones off chain. Today i even read one exchange is implementing LN, so you could send new funds directly into your LN wallet. (Although i think that exchange is very small).
@_date: 2018-07-31 21:53:26
Using banks abroad is even more risky. When traveling always have some multiple backups ready.
I had 2 maestro bank cards from the same bank. One from a premium package, more expensive but offers free ATM withdrawals abroad. The second card was the same but connected to a cheap package for which you needed to pay like 3 euro per ATM withdrawal. In whole Peru the "free" ATM withdrawal card didn't work and the other worked fine. Probably they just block some high fee networks, but if that's your only bank card you would be fked!
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:03:26


Uhm that banks and central banks can not f*ck up anymore as people will run to get into bitcoin. So for the first time in history i would say those institutions have something to fear, something out of control. Control put back into the hands of people who own all the (fiat) money.

Because the EU is a shit show. Economist already told what happened in '90s. But politicians wanted to rule a bigger territory so they went ahead anyway.
We blame the Euro but it is not the fault of the euro itself.

Finally a bit more logic gets back into the market. It's a good sign (not so good for alt holders though).

Although trading may give you a profit i have to agree with you. Buy and hold is a good strategy. Especially if you buy frequently over long long periods.

No guarantee that you will not loose all those BTC though. But good luck with trading (speculating).
@_date: 2018-07-19 19:02:01
You think in the next financial crisis cb's can print themselves out of it again? Oh wait the ECB is still printing money right now... Governments can do nothing if the fate in a fiat is falling away.  
You don't have to change anything, you think if i go to a random country and pay with my debit card there first needs to made a change in the currency rate before we make the deal?
And even your usd/eur exchange already makes no sense, companies don't change prices that much now either. A 100$ jeans may cost 100€ in the eu without checking the price even on a yearly basis.

The worlds biggest investor says not to invest with borrowed money, you better take his advice.
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:48:27
They will also learn that before Bitcoin there was a believe that only inflationary money can be real money. Otherwise they thought at that time period that the total world economy would collapse and there will be never a new investment.

@_date: 2018-07-06 13:02:54
So you think Nvidia buys for 50 mil in BTC, then even use those BTC for buying altcoins. What if the price goes down further? They will write in their annual letter, sorry guys we blew 50 mil on trying to pump the Altcoin market but it didn't work out.
They can't and never would if they still are thinking straight.
@_date: 2018-07-08 14:19:41
They don't change the real supply, they change the paper supply.
If i buy 1 mil in Bitcoin, i own an x percentage of the total BTC market supply.
If i buy 1 mil of BTC future contracts long though i "own" one 1 mil in BTC (as someone need to deliver me this BTC). But future contracts can be written without any underlying assets. 
So i can underwrite  a future contract for you that say that i will deliver you 1 mil in BTC, but in fact i might not have any BTC. So (only) the paper supply is +1 mil.
@_date: 2018-07-14 18:01:20
What is happening in December?
@_date: 2018-07-23 22:36:47
' The problem is, the moment that one person lends a bitcoin and charges interest, it sets in motion a dilemma that I don’t think many people are considering right now. You have effectively created an obligation to pay back more bitcoin than will ever exist. ' 
You know that the federal reserve lends every dollar in existence too right? So for every printed 1 USD there need to be given back 1 USD + interest (i think it was around 0.25% but i might be wrong).
@_date: 2018-07-15 10:07:05
Yes, the same for many alt coins. I almost feel bad for people how they came so close to the good thing but then they fell in the big trap.
I sometimes warn them and explain what will happen, but they say all coins are rare and laugh at me.

Nice nice, i figured mining was too hard at ~$100. I read about it pretty much but i figured with uncertain changes in mining machines (and sellers at that time) and my countries high electricity cost it would be a waste. I wasn't clever enough to anyway buy some coins though, lol.
@_date: 2018-07-23 08:24:32
Decentralised exchanges like WavesDEX suc* harder than Coinbase, so there should be a place for both.

The difference is with a debit/credit card you have no choice as all info is known and controlled by other parties. While in bitcoin you have options.
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:43:42
Possible of course but if they need something from you or have a "special"  deal i would be extra careful. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 22:06:05
Banks have kind of adopt to the internet. Often with shitty apps/services, but they got along. They could lay off ten thousands of people and have still a good business model. But banks will have a hard time the next two decades, they are still as bad as in/after the financial crisis and that will eventually kill them.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:35:00
You understand that those "insurances" are just a guarantee for people to not do a bank run right?
@_date: 2018-07-06 08:53:55
Not a big analysis as i didn't already believe it before. But just check for yourself some volumes of futures. Than compare this with volume of exchanges where you can short (Bitfinex for example) than with trading volumes of BTC.
People try to explain how there can be a big downtrend which is a bit ridiculous. But to be honest i think there are not many real traders had already an understanding in normal financial markets/stock markets. (There are of course but you don't hear from them that often). Did someone complain when prices went up 10/20% a day last year? Did someone tell at that moment it was all manipulated too?  
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:53:53
How can keeping debt off the books to get into the Eurozone (otherwise they would never have been able to get in) be legal and even if there is no law against it it isn't a problem anymore?

That has nothing to do with my statement. I understand it is possible and even very bad financially to do this. But you can easily have the money in your bank. I do use a creditcard sometimes, not because i need the credit, just because i use the payment system with the special perks.

Adoption in USA, not adoption in general. Not bad no that he only those 4 strong coins (okay 3 as CB also does sells BCH)? Better than all those people screaming about the next shitcoin which gets listed on exchange X.
But i think in the USA the demand from institutional investors to regulate BTC is bigger than the need to ban consumers to get into BTC.
@_date: 2018-07-04 10:19:04
I know, it is just bad that BTC is always in the news or in some programs referred to as money laundering or illegal payments, while in facts banks do it on a daily basis and pay hugeeeee fines and  know one really cares about that.
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:40:26
Try an exchange in your country (or one of the big ones). Like Kraken, Coinbase etc.
@_date: 2018-07-10 07:22:14
Although it might look problematic, this isn't one that will threaten us. We have much much bigger problems though.
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:42:12
What hurts BTC most is that when central banks will go in full offense (not by competition but just by FUD of course). 
Firstly it was washing money and the only thing BTC was used for was to buy drugs. But apparently after screaming this for years they came to the conclusion that those terms were empty. No one gave a fuk.

He didn't understand tech either.
He also has stakes in many banks, financial companies, Mastercard, Visa and AE. So he has zero motivation to "like" this new coin. Also he has no problems with inflation, while many of us do. As most of his businesses can easily surpass the inflation to consumers so profit stays the same or can even be raised. Our savings account is hurt very much by inflation.

A pretty neat business model in those hard times lol.
@_date: 2018-07-08 11:02:27
Why complain? They do 0-conf to make it more convenient for buyers. They take the risk for you. Anyway as long as they are not scammed they find it pretty okay.  To be honest i don't understand why not more shops do this. Let say you own a coffeeshop, does it really be that big risk to loose 1 coffee sale? 
It is not that taking cash money or card money doesn't have any risk for the shops. Plus they pay fees for that too, so as long BTC outperforms other payments systems they have nothing to worry.
@_date: 2018-07-25 08:49:55

Auto buy might be interesting for people who want to invest regularly without to much afford.
@_date: 2018-07-02 22:26:25
If u can pay with BTC just do so, you can just buy new one on the exchange anyway no? Who is holding anyone back to not buy more! :)
I think it really helps though. Let say an entrepreneur accepts Bitcoin as he wants to be supportive. But after 1 year only 4 people paid in BTC, for him its not really all that interesting and he might abandon the ship.
@_date: 2018-07-23 09:06:52

Bitcoin was just too high prices in December. There was too much air in the price. That got popped out. It happens all the time and in any market. Nothing wrong with that. Hope all the air will popped out of altcoins too as imo it is still overpriced.

"Lee also declared at the summit that under normal market conditions, Bitcoin should trade at least twice the mining cost."
No it should not, the mining of BTC doesn't set any price.
"The current BTC mining cost is about $9,100."
Haha, what a joke. And even if that is the average, what would make that reliable for a price indication? If i start mining for gold here in my country at 100k an ounce cost price it doesn't make Gold go up, it will just drain my bank account rather quickly.
@_date: 2018-07-02 18:58:26
So why bank accounts keep getting closed and even the bank accounts of exchanges. That a goldman sachs is building a trading desk (trading based on bitcoin, so not trading the real product btw) is not the standard.
Haha it is not a threat, read the BIS report please. If it is not a threat to them, why they react than so scarcely?

Yes, to be honest i think that this will be the main drive behind Bitcoin in the near future. Some country will f-up again, people will adopt and even Banks and business will start to buy in. It will probably the biggest wealth transfer from the current rich to the poos as those people will be the first people who will simply need the coins to survive. 
I'm really interested to see what BTC will do when the west will roll into another financial crisis. (Not sure yet how people will react on this "new option" yet).
As far as i see it for now is that we will see a huge drop at first when people just sell to get some dollars, but after a while when people understand that BTC will just keep running a very big new wave of money comes in which will make the rate go bonkers.
@_date: 2018-07-04 19:40:47
No it would not. According to this website i am checking Coinbase is the 4# biggest in daily volume. If Gox didn't kill Bitcoin, why you think now those much smaller exchanges would bring any real impact? 
It might just take longer that's all. The states will then get further behind the rest of the world.

Bankers who constructed the Greece debt deal to get them into the EU for example. The bankers who invented and sold many many bad mortgages around the world. How banks made themselves on purpose to big to fail and used this as an advantage to speculate with the down risks protected by tax money (although others need to prevent this but they are in their pockets so its two to blame).

Also if you are going to buy, just firstly buy a small amount and play with it. If you make a mistake it is better a $5 dollar mistake than a 1300$ one. After some buying/selling/transactions you get to understand much more and at mostly a small amount of learning cost.

Many people on the local bitcoin forum trade in usd or usdt, i have no idea why. If i ask them they tell it is more logical to trade in USD. I really can't understand why they don't just look up the price in USD if they want that for trading and then doing the actual trading in EUR. It save them currency risk indeed, but i guess most even don't really understand that or considered it even.

Energy isn't wasted. It is used. If you use energy to dig gold out of the ground, when you finally found gold you dig a new whole in the ground to save that gold for later, that is an energy waste.

No i wouldn't agree to this at all to be honest. Look in January bitcoin but more important the whole altcoin market was in high bubble territory. It was pretty absurd. So that prices would fall was not all that strange.
The usd with any other major currency pairs is in constant battle to protect their own export levels. Central banks and other parties are watching this closely (look how the yuan fell hard just after USA was talking about import taxes).
Bitcoin isn't really corresponding too much to any financial news in my opinion, it is pretty much still going its own way. (I'm personally very interest to see what bitcoin will do in the next financial crisis, to be honest i have no idea yet).

If ETF's get listed Alt will go down in my opinion. New cash will flow only into BTC and it can get huge.

Exchanges for sure are allowing everyday illegal activities on their exchanges. Actually it is funny that everyone needs to show their ID but illegal trading seems normal.
In ICO land many coin offerings are very dubious, under normal conditions they would have had big problems with law enforcement but at the moment i think the law enforcement want a more clear path on what should be done with those cases. Crypto more than any other business is very international oriented which makes it even harder (as governments often have a different viewpoint and are not always on the best terms with each other).

I know countries where elec cost 1-4 cents. Guess were all the miners mine? For big miners the elec cost is just a part, they have other costs too. Besides that if prices become so low that some miners would be starting to turn of their miners and difficulty lowers which means the rest of the miners becoming more profitable. The mining cost really doesn't say that much.

Stock's aren't necessarily better at this moment, maybe they aren't really going down anytime soon. But the upside at this moment is also very limited.  Due to a long bull market and a lot of central banks printed money we are very far from the bottom right now.

You can write down a mnemonic seed on paper, no need to print.

Don't go into altcoins because you "missed" bitcoin that could be a very big mistake. Also don't rush into things, just try to understand it first (both). You will not lose because the price might go up, just firstly get yourself comfortable with bitcoin (even very small amounts can help you with that).
Maybe show him some videos from Andreas, they are pretty good.

So that is a good thing?
I don't want to wake up in the morning and see a 30% withdrawal of my bank account (savings) with the text: "Help for Italy to save the EURO, kind regards ECB".
It's a failed project if they need tax payers money to keep the fiat alive, it will than definitely fail at some point. Anyway the 2010 euro crisis was just the beginning, next crisis will be much much bigger. Northern banks/countries/people will pay for this project to keep it floating.
@_date: 2018-07-25 10:03:27
I don't understand why he has so many errors while paying. Is it because he uses his own node? When using an android app i got way less problems while paying with LN..
@_date: 2018-07-14 07:34:52
Yes, so op is wondering how we can go from a highly burdened fiat debt society to bitcoinization. Actually the question is pretty good to ask. 
You just assume it is possible without any guidance how we could. Many people are finding themselves maximal in debt. So how they can ever escape the fiat threatmill? They hardly can keep up with the interest and repayments. Even whole governments live such kind of lifestyle. 
Debt in fiat doesn't magically disappear because of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-01 23:16:05
mhhmmmm kay.
@_date: 2018-07-03 23:54:28
Not gonna happen though. Anyway the more a country wants to ban it the more attention and the more people want to have it. 
I don't really understand why you want to close the fiat gateway for adoption though. If you want adoption to happen you will have to be more patient and put your own input to make it happen. It will take a lot of time for this to happen and i am not really sure it ever will be used as a main currency.
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:49:44
I think a good point to start is changing banks.

Ver is that you?
@_date: 2018-07-04 08:26:11
Yes and how they can prevent even Americans just not to get into Bitcoin? You know how many have wealth outside of their country? You clearly have no understanding of this whole concept, but that is fine. Good luck with your monopoly money.
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:39:29
Also in the EU the can and do it in this way. Basically they buy up all government bonds and corporate bonds too as there is probably not even enough supply of bonds. So buy buying bonds they not only create money from thin air, they also support the bond market (even lower the interest) and buy up all bad debt like Italian bonds. 
They started this shitshow in 2009 and are still typing in monthly some new big numbers.
@_date: 2018-07-05 19:29:37
Yes true, but it also shows that Bitcoin becomes more of a worry to them. As it is clear to me that they have no idea how to really get rid of the thing that could brake there system.
And it does show that they don't want to create a best working system in the world, they just want as much control as possible (which was already clear ofc, but they just confirm it again and again).
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:31:57
How does a bank protect me from losses while they can freeze my account at any time or inflate the money away? BTW not everyone lives as a debt slave.

A while back he told Bitcoin works great so he can't really makes his mind up.
@_date: 2018-07-06 08:56:39
It doesn't but they look at it as activity as BTC is on the move. (So maybe a sale or buy transaction can/did happen).
But it easily might be one person just throwing BTC from one place to another :)

This year there are 657.000 new bitcoins, let say at a 7.5k$ with 100% electric cost = $5B elect cost.
Mining gold in 2016 was at a total of 3100 MT gold,  /oz  = 124.000 Million usd per year in total revenue. Let say only 8% of the revenue is spent on energy it is ~$10B energy cost.
We both know that A: miners don't spent 100% on elec at this cost price and B: that gold cost more than 8% in energy to get it out of the ground.
I don't really understand what your ROI has to do with it but okay. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:51:46
I think its a valid feature to base prices on multiple big exchanges instead of Gemini alone.

Yes and he guarantees it is worth less in the future so pretty stable no? If the value of the euro goes up he just print new euros. As 1 euro is 1 euro, so he would be stupid not to print his own piggy bank.
@_date: 2018-07-05 09:51:18
Interest, hahahha what a good joke. Yes you have 0 insurance, but what you need that for anyway? Can you come up with a more secure way to protect your assets in any other form? If you don't trust one of the many options there are to store it you can always go for something like Coinbase. It's similar to a bank.
That's why ETF's are a good thing, so people have yet another option to store it.
But to save a bank is save it is ridiculous. There is no insurance that a bank has your money, in fact they don't even have it. You need to trust than the whole system and it's currency to gave back your wealth at any time. And this problem we already saw in '08. Nothing has changed since that time either, they just made new laws to put banks even in a bigger position.
@_date: 2018-07-06 10:33:07

If you and your people really want change i think the best thing to do is fight for your rights. People are in the end always able to demand change, although often they don't see it and are scared. 
Our government in both Europe and USA is already not good for their own citizens, so don't expect much help from "the west". They are too busy with their own BS.

Here you went wrong, how you can do such deals on that website?
@_date: 2018-07-07 22:32:29
Just leave them. Often they show every reason to just do the opposite as they believe. It gives you confidence that you are right and are ready for what to come.
Earlier today i had a discussion about that this was the right time to buy a house. (After a big increase in house prices, extreme low interest rates and more flexible mortgages). I said that this is the perfect time to save some money and scoop a good deal in the following years. The guys response was that a couple of years back people also screamed about this (he was clearly not seeing the bigger picture).

Bitcoin is working fine, it gets better every day too. Yes people are using it for greedy reasons, who cares, they get burned anyway if they don't understand what they got.
An ETF is just making it more mainstream. There is a demand and people/parties who want an ETF can or will not buy a bitcoin the way we can/do. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 09:26:26
If you need to ask this on a public forum you are probably not the right person for OTC trades.
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:19:13
Many trade in USD, i have no idea why. So let say they buy in EUR and then all further trades involve USD. Also i think many EU countries have their own exchange as they have their own laws/payment processors. So the volume is never as big as a big nation wide used exchange like in America.

True, also if something else overtake bitcoin i think i would subtract my money. Because if a new tech can take over the old tech it can keep happening. Bitcoin can adapt to some futures in the future. LN looks very promising to me.
@_date: 2018-07-19 19:06:08
true that.

Many stocks are more risky, heck even fiat is more risky. Not even talking about those negative bonds, how silly are those?
@_date: 2018-07-26 13:28:18
I have zero transaction banking fees, so that will be hard to compete with. But yes for business transaction fees can already be a good incentive. Other points are very true. 
Right now i am just thinking that a major issue is that even if it is performing better, as long as it isn't widely available it's hard to really become the alternative though. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 18:12:44
Maybe we can sell our fiat one day to other countries too? Those 100T bills are pretty interesting :)

It's based on performance. So basically instead of sending you xx fiat they give you the option to send BTC to your wallet.

True, but to be honest i think the current empire would fall before that happens. The dollar did survive a long time (by force). But it's really the end game now, Russia is pulling out. China is becoming less willing to buy the debt, now Trump will make it worse by all kind of ridiculous inventions. The Dollar is doomed as soon as a next world currency is taking the place of the former. It might be Bitcoin, who knows. Euro isn't strong enough and China is not willing to take the position and maybe also not strong enough.
@_date: 2018-07-05 09:08:57
Why you need to insure crypto to be honest? You are talking about the "insurance policy" that if a bank goes bust you still get your 100k fiat or  whatever?
@_date: 2018-07-25 18:03:03
And now you stopped trading? If i can 5x a bitcoin i would continue :)
@_date: 2018-07-14 08:47:50
I doubt it. Do you ever see 21T us gov debt transfer to BTC? I'm pretty sure it is not possible.
@_date: 2018-07-02 16:53:41
I highly doubt that. Most likely they just have an anti crypto policy as they are becoming more and more nervous of this technology. The internet didn't brake them, slowly they adjusted and they moved their business online. Lets see if they can also withstand the power of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-28 19:41:51
True, but why in the world you will think that the whole bitcoin network will ever go down?
That is your only point why gold is better than bitcoin?

Suchs people and companies need to get their finance firstly straight. Then if they start to build wealth they could think about putting something in Bitcoin. Because what are they "storing" in Bitcoin as they have nothing to store yet.

Don't think he will ever understand BTC though.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:01:49
It doesn't really matter that much i think.
Look if i own 1 bitcoin and i lend it to you (for let say 1.01 bitcoin in one year). 
Basically i own a IOU worth 1.01 btc and you own 1 real btc. Now one year is gone and you decided to hide. Basically i own nothing anymore and you have 1 bitcoin which can be used for whatever.
Lending bitcoin will probably only hurt the two parties involved no?

@_date: 2018-07-29 10:17:49
I think its not possible? Maybe offer them to buy 1-3-6-12 months and let them pay with bitcoin. So they can have the same usage but be in control of their payment and also have a choice to prepay for how long they want.

Don't worry to much, soon you will see that there is plenty enough energy. In Europe you already see it in summer that's that whole countries over generate because of the solar energy. They keep installing new panels and also wind energy keeps increasing. In xx years we will look back the same way on banks as on energy.

Too bad that many people will loose bitcoin while believing in that man. 
Although they probably didn't understand what bitcoin was about in the first place.
@_date: 2018-07-12 08:44:16
Yes that is correct, they could. Some maybe even are.
But we have to worry if the smart money is betting against Bitcoin. They have power in media, law enforcement, politicians. They can pull some real strings, not a person who happens to own 10k BTC and now will move the price, its not how things work. Maybe in some altcoins but not in BTC. Bitcoin still is a very new asset with lot's of improvements but also still many risks. Some people are in it for the tech, many are just speculating. It happens to sell across the whole world. It had hudge returns in the past. So it's more than logical that the price is moving all ways, as people pull the price in all directions.
Look, someone in China may read in the news: "China is banning Bitcoin!!", while someone in Venezuela is taking his last fiat to get rid of fiat. And the third person in America is speculating on the Bitcoin price. Three people with three different intentions and ideas.

I know i use booking.com as well. But you compare Airbnb to booking.com. You can't be more wrong.

Because we can't be a stable coin with this kind of volume and market cap. Just put it out of your head, no asset class of this size is as stable as a dollar.
If you want something stable you better keep your depreciating fiat. 
I understand your point, but it is really just impossible at this moment. Look only at the USD/EUR pair for example, is this stable? (Central) banks / companies / raw materials / investors / customers are all influenced by this trading pair. You might not feel it directly but for sure you will be the one paying for that more expensive coffee bean. 
If you would anyway to pay with BTC you can do a couple of things, charge your hot wallet with a bit of coins and spend it anyway (you take some losses and some profits). Buy cheaply coins and only spent them when your in the profit (the risk of a falling price will make you bag holder/ not able to spent).
Buy "spending" coins only when you really spent them (there not so big change of losing money on a daily basis).

As long as there is cash it still can be a big market. It can/will be used than as a escape/insurance against this hegemony.
If there is no cash anymore either there is still a chance to be used for off the book transactions. No doubt that in such state of the world there will be a lot of resistance against this state and the market would thrive.

Don't really understand the hype abotu those ATM's tbh. You see often pictures here like its a very good thing.
If the fee is like 10% it is way to high (but expected it would be so), but don't think it is really bad for adoption.

Why people would sell btc for paying the bills? Not everyone has bad personal finance and would need to sell for the next bill to come. Many more people still have a positive fiat balance which they can easily throw into bitcoin to protect themselves.

The total energy usage of gold mining is way higher than the total bitcoin energy usage. Also i have no doubt that the energy used is much worse, as gold miners mainly using bad fuels while bitcoin eventually can be mined on green energy.
It is true, in Europe in summer already some countries way overproduce the total supply they need. And they haven't reached the full potential of green energy by far. As every day new solar and wind systems gets installed. Imagine this for 12 more years. For sure at least in Europe we will be floating in cheap green energy.

Yes true, the fee to open a channel is $0.02 so not so bad. LN is still very new so of course it doesn't work perfect yet. I also did many smaller transactions when some are routed for free. So it is fast, reliable and cheap.
I didn't use the LN payment to have the most cheap option, otherwise i would have used my bankaccount which has free transactions and would save me a lot of time to not setup any wallet or so.

Yes and it is easily possible. In my country we already have kind of this thing in place. Although it is not basic income but just welfare system and all kind of ridiculous benefits. Let say you need a PhD to know all the rules and benefits.
The problem is with our system that it cost a lot of money to control and anyway there is a lot of fraud. It is much much easier to give a negative tax or a basic income. But than the government and all its employers are not needed anymore and loose their control.

Sometimes from where you are sending bitcoin tx is fixed so you can't really do anything than just to send it or stop using their services. Sometimes exchanges do it or an app/service which you use send a way higher fee.
@_date: 2018-07-08 12:59:26
But why you want it? What problem it should solve? I don't really get it.
Because of people are unable to buy it themselves somehow? Althought i doubt it as there are many options. Or because they can't really save money and by this trick they invest little bits every time they purchase? Or what?

@_date: 2018-07-13 16:59:52
Of course it can, not like it didn't happen before.
That there is debt doesn't mean it always gets paid back. Yes you need to pay back your mortgage otherwise they will come and take it. But if the States decided not to pay anymore on its debt obligations there is not much anyone could do. (It will hurt the States a lot of course).
But as a country i think they never decides freely to abandon an old currency system. The most likely way a new currency appears is when an old one starts to hyper inflate. Look how BTC can take over payments in Venezuela for example. The problem  is that almost no one has any Bitcoin so how much traction a Bitcoin can really deliver if everyone is poor and no one has any BTC. (In Venezuela they can mine though although that also comes with some risks). So when there is a total sudden collapse it is really doubtful that BTC is there to take over. 
Nevertheless if you at that moment own Bitcoin you are golden, Look at the times the German mark started to hyper inflate. If you had any gold you could start to buy up the whole country. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 22:08:51

More like a 1 out of 10. 
But think about a mortgage and a country. If the couple doesn't pay anymore in a couple of months the house gets sold off at an actuation at XX% of the house value. Who is going to broker the deal to sell of whole China lol?
They just stop paying and gone is all the money. So everything above i think it is ~80%, lets make it 100% is very unrealistic. It just shows they are never really having the intention to pay it off the normal way. Like now they are just printing the money so of course the can do whatever they want.

Yes i agree, there are some dis advances with a public ledger :p
But personally i don't worry that much about it myself.

They don't really need to, it is just an extra option.
Merchants also don't need to accept debit/credit cards or cash. Although it is pretty convenient if they offer all option.
A merchant may do it as he will pay less in fees and all transactions are irreversible, so that is convenient for them. Also the business might increase while offering bitcoin payments while other business don't offer it, so giving them a unique selling point. I have now a spending wallet on my phone so i too will use it for commerce wherever possible.
From a consumer perspective it might give a bit more privacy as it is far more likely that they track my bank account details than the do with my btc spending. Most likely LN/btc will improve this even further.

Yes i had the exact same problem with Lightning spin (also one channel i connected to first wasn't even able to receive any credits from LNspin). I worked around it like you with LNconductor. But that shouldn't really be the solution and this point should be thought about or fixed i think. 
I hardly doubt all credits and debits are every inline in a persons finance (especially on LN). Before i wanted twice to receive money but didn't really have the space to do so. Yesterday i wanted to spend 60$ and needed to open a new channel and than the channel showed that it can only spent and not receive back. So that channel has a 60$ open place to receive but i am not able to do so, so again a channel which is pretty useless. (Also the 60$ transaction had a 2900 sat fee).
Side node: the tech is cool thought and i am just playing with it, especially the very low transactions like 1 satoshi instant transactions look promising!
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:52:31

That's not really how it work though. We wouldn't wait for everyone to understand something to make it happen.
I see how our country changed the last 30 years. They will just demand from you to do something (if you can't its your problem and you have to figure out how to do it). Basically you need internet and online banking to get around, if you don't have or understand it its your problem.
Also forbidding something is not so easy as you think or now do suggest. There are always new ways to get around something (that's probably why they don't push now, as they are scared as hell what will come afterwards). And in the end if there is a big enough amount of people involved they even will risk revolution.

Yes, but the euro is not really stable. Just look at the eur/usd rate. It isn't that stable. In your 10 year example you talk about a 4-5% inflation, which might look not much, as a 1.3 coffee will be "only" 2. But such inflation is insane for stable countries/currencies. Look at target2, wage difference in the eu zone, production differences, debt difference. Many countries are not following the economic rules in any year. In the next financial crisis it will be very hard to let this "project" not explode.

But why it needs to be? Gold hasn't been used for much more than store of value for decades now. Has gold been dropping? No i didn't think so either.
Transactions can give BTC more value, but it's not what give BTC its only value. Let's be honest, for now normal people under normal circumstances will not use BTC. They really have no reason to at this moment. But in Venezuela BTC might be already the best solution to use for everyday transactions.

Yes i can agree with you. Everything is changed since the last crisis. Government is even trying to restrict sales for pension funds if they ask (They wanted to just call blackrock and tell them that they are not allowed selling until further notice).
It will not stop by a bail-in, to be honest i think they even already have a plan not to let all the money to flow to BTC. Because if they allow this it will be extremely huge for Bitcoin, can you image how people will look when somebody can spent freely money while others can withdraw only a 100 from the ATM. Only at that moment people will open their eyes and see what was going on.

It depends, if he tells he like Bitcoin and by his own account pore Billions into it, he can definitely create a bottom by himself. Let say he just buys up everything up to $7.5k and keep doing so. With his capital he can keep doing that for a pretty while.

I have read a lot about Warren Buffett and i have much respect for him. He talks often about circle  of competence. I think this is a part were Warren doesn't really fully understand Bitcoin and that is okay for him. Although i don't really understand why he attacks it so hard (it might be a real threat to his businesses, but that should not make him say such things no?)
Bitcoin is different than stocks because a business is always worth something (liquidation value, cash flows, patents etc). So a stock could have a intrinsic value which makes it worth that price (or often lots more, like Warren showed). Bitcoin has no or little future cash flows and the liquidation value is close to zero. It is very hard to price bitcoin, it might be worth 6.4k like it is now. But also 4k, 2k, 200, 10k or 20k. It really is just worth what someone is willing to pay for it.
But i think its more realistic to see bitcoin as gold or just money. USD or EUR are basically also worth zero. It is a worthless piece of paper and more often it is just a number inside a central ledger. But we the people have put a lot of trust in it. So that makes it worth something none the less.
None the less the future will be bright!

Actually it was in the news that our country with some other countries asked for a stop of those foreign investors. Somehow.
But to be honest i think most properties are just owned by our own citizens. Also many couples are talked into a highly leveraged debt with "low interests". There is a big gap between the "haves" and "have nots" and it is growing.
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:27:55
I just checked the website and for me it was only clear on the last payment page. At that time i most likely already have another payment option ready and you also advertise the price in euro. But yes there should be more adoption. Maybe try a incentive to let people pay by BTC for a discount.

It was a bubble which had to pop. Nothing wrong with that, bitcoin imo is stronger than before. So all is good.
I found it very strange when bch splitted from bitcoin and basically the value was just "an extra". Normally let say when a stock split basically A ends up with 70% of the price and B ends up wiht 30%. But in this bubble the hype was so real that people saw it as extra free money.

Where bitcoin is registered, could you show me your wisdom?
@_date: 2018-07-20 08:09:23
Yes true, to be honest i think the people behind many alt coins are trying to keep at least the price in bitcoin at a constant level. Because many order books are not filled at all this isn't so big a problem as some have a lot of cash. They don't deserve the same growth as bitcoin. But sooner rather than later they will be corrected i suppose.
@_date: 2018-07-04 08:31:09
No, many people are adopting for real, i don't care about the speculation part. That Bitcoin "burst" again to a higher level, who cares. The real adoption is happening if you like it or not. Look at Turkey, they have the biggest population percentage in the EU who is using BTC, why you think? Exactly, not for speculation but for what BTC was meant to do.
I don't care if Bitcoin raises to a higher ATH and burst again to a higher bottom because of speculation (speculation is happening in all markets btw and the cb's even fuel this). But i hope you noticed that looking at the 1 year chart that it is still showing growth, even while there was a massive speculation.
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:29:08

For the foreseeable future we don't really have to write debt in bitcoin in my opinion. Basically it will not be very clever to sign a debt contract in a strong currency while many fiats will loose its value big time. 
Same as people who live in a country with not so strong fiat, they tempt to get a mortgage in eur/usd because the interest is much lower. But they can easily end up paying much more because the eur/usd will outpreform their currency.
Lets first make bitcoin big and less volatile before worrying about future applications too much.

No you shouldn't, look at Warren Buffet. Of course he can make a extra buck by "manipulating" the stock prices for a while. It would probably be a good bet, for sure at the beginning when he still has reputation and people will fall for his "trick". But sooner rather than later he is wrong on his bet and he is loosing big time. So for whales its better to hold than to speculate for a small extra gain you don't need in the first place.
You really think it matters if you have 1k Bitcoin to get 1005? I would rather keep those 1k than a chance to loose my bet and end up with only 800 left in the wallet.
@_date: 2018-07-02 10:00:28
Would love to see it go down to $2k lol.
@_date: 2018-07-02 09:29:55
We at this moment know that two things can happen, one case is that those coins are never going to circulation and a second case tells that they would be used.
The current price is somewhere in between of those two cases. When the coins hit the market there will be a small downward pressure and if it can be certain (but how we ever could) that the coins are lost there might be a slight spike. Nothing to worry about in any case.
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:45:59
Maybe have some bitcoin in a hot wallet ready to spent? Like on your mobile phone app or something. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 11:27:26
this, also investors might only start investing in it after the government approved that it is okay to do so (which makes it less risky).

@_date: 2018-07-23 07:56:43
It doesn't go only up if that is what you thought. Also if you need to pay something shortly it isn't a good idea to hold bitcoin as a currency. In terms of a currency bitcoin is way too small at the moment, so that's why you see this kind of volatility.

So at $100k per BTC everyday you need around $180 Mil to buy up those coins.  though is that he is assuming that all miners dump all their rewards directly.

It's not a problem as we still price it in one fiat for as long as we start to use a next fiat. Europe already showed that it is not that big of a deal to switch from one fiat to the next. So now you can buy a coffee of 2$ and pay in bitcoin at whatever exchange rate, not such a big deal.

Yes i agree. But to be honest i don't think that they can really ban it anymore. No country can fully ban it, Bitcoin came to far already. If they fed is going to ban, they risk of making a wrong call on this and that can jeopardizes themselves. But US can survive the Bitcoin revolution so i think its one of the countries who will join pretty soon.

Actually fiat currencies also are not really spend all that often. Look at the Velocity of Money the M1 level of the USD or EUR would not be that great, even though the central banks try to rig the game by making you spend your money. 
But true, holding in not bad for Bitcoin and it indeed helps it even. The price can adjust itself to economic needs so it doesn't really matter how many people hold nor how many spent Bitcoin. Both can be done at the same time.
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:11:25
Altcoin was way overprised (bubbel?) becaues it lifted on the hype of bitcoin.

BTC will stabilize when it becomes bigger. The bigger the asset the harder to change prices. At the moment bitcoin is a really really small asset class.
For many people btc can already be used as a currency. If you like privacy or live in a country with a shitcoin fiat btc is already a better option and you take the volatility for granted.
@_date: 2018-07-05 16:16:48
For prices i just check some exchange that i use or cmc.
In the end you have to pay some transaction fee to get your BTC on the exchange &gt; the price it sells for on a exchange you choose at that moment &gt; Minus the transaction fee for that transaction. &gt;
Minus the fiat withdrawal cost. (So that is basically your most accurate price :) )
So in general just pick a price from a place which is easily for grasp and you have a decent price indication.

I think bitcoin will succeed. Basically at this current state of worlds economy bitcoin is not needed so much and just working fine. Some people are interested and few understand the logic's behind it. 
But that's okay, we just keep going and improving bitcoin. Now somewhere in a few years the next financial crisis will undoubtedly hit the market. More than in 2007 everything is connected, although at this crisis there will be a whole new "safe haven". A system who doesn't have a debt burden, can't be stopped, can't be totally controlled nor can't be confiscated. It's border less and capital can freely move around the world.
The best days of bitcoin are still ahead and only then it will prove itself to the world how valuable this blockchain really is.

Spoofing is illegal in different countries, so i suppose if the exchange is there they should need to follow that law. Although i am not a lawyer.
So investor/spoofer/exchange i think if they really want they can find a way to use the law but to be honest i think really no one cares about that at the moment. The more wildwest the crypto is the more they can "hate" it.

It does matter though.

I buy regularly but not consisted. It's hard to put a real value on bitcoin, so i find it hard to just throw in all the money at 6k$. So i just buy whenever i feel like buying and the price is not that important to me. Not the best way, especially not economically. Still prices of today i feel comfortable buying, although there is a good chance that ETF will not be approved and prices move down once again. Just always keep enough fiat behind!

It very much depends on the country thought. Some are trying to lead in this space and others more or less try to fight it.
To be honest i think many (northern) countries are pretty well organized, finance is going well for both government and personally. They are not worried that BTC takes over in a bad way (as there is really no need for that). So if needed the whole system can more easily adapt. Instead of fighting it they give the people the freedom to go for it and try to make something from it.

Seriously, show me one investment strategy were initial money out is good. Just a book, an intelligent investor who said it. Whatsoever. 
Don't putting all your eggs in one basket and diversify and revalue those assets from time to time might be a good strategy though. But just getting money out to reduce the "risk" is about the stupidest thing i have ever heard.

Coinbase, kraken, bitstamp. Or some exchange in your own country maybe?
A easy/good way to send your fiat money is important. SEPA Eur transactions to exchanges are way more smooth than dollar transactions for example. So look into that to see if you can expect some trouble from your currency/bank/country.

Use a better bank instead.
Coinbase SEPA wire transactions are finished in 2-3 hours on business days. Your bank isn't really settling the money transaction so Coinbase isn't going to really realize you the funds (perfectly reasonable from their side).
Ask your bank to handle business like we are in 2018 instead of the 50's...

No you don't. Look how in Europe there were centuries of stable money with very low inflation/deflation. Yet the economy was thriving and debt was all around.

Because it is impossible for bitcoin to be stable already. It exist a mere ten years in a thousands year old financial world. How you think it will finds its equilibrium directly?
Even if you just look at the past decade and compare fiat currencies there is big volatility between them. Bitcoin will reach a stable nature far in the future when the prices went through the roof and majority of people start to trust and feel comfortable with it. It can take decades more, but it also is likely to promise some bright future ahead (percentage profit wise) as before we hit a boring stable coin we have to see some more gains.

Just today as i almost always pay anything possible with cash. I don't really like much how easily traceable my spending is. I have been reducing my card spending by pretty much everything since i became more aware of my own loss of privacy. Cash payments are actually pretty awesome!
I get your points, but it isn't really comparable though. The bank promoting you to pay with a credit/debit card instead of cash is a whole different idea than no one in the world convincing you to pay with bitcoin. Government and banks pushed you to do exactly what you did. They had all the means to let you do so.
Just try to talk with people about digital money, fiat currencies, fractional reserve banking, mortgages in general and most if not all people you find are pretty clueless. They think everything in the current system is pretty fine beside complaining about exactly what bitcoin could be their solution they haven't been looking for (but its not easy to let them see this point).

No the USD can print whatever they want. But the value will ever decreases. Why you think some countries keep printing and adding zero's to the amounts? As printing 1 bolivar bills just makes no sense anymore.
If there is the EUR and the USD and the US decided to print 21 Trillion, you really think that the value eur/usd is around 1~ still? No of course not, so the more they print the less it will be worth, but they can print forever until just no one gives a fuck anymore.

It's just too early for bitcoin to work as a world currency. It might already work in a dysfunctional system like Venezuela but in the rest of the world fiat currencies are better right now. But it is like saying internet fails in 90's as you couldn't watch hd movies yet.


You weren't arround in 08/09? And if you think that a 2-3% inflation rate makes your stable your dead wrong. Its a perfect good reason for that bitcoin will eventually work better anyways.


As explained by Peter Thiel a new technology must be x times better to overtake the other older technology. Bitcoin has the very potential to do so, but there are still things which have to be fixed. And unlike just starting to write an email instead of a postcard. Doing this with money is a bit harder as people value money a lot and are very concerned and reserved by changes there. 
Maybe adoption goes too slow for you, but imagine that today almost half of the worlds citizens is still not using internet 20 years in. Can you imagine your life without internet?


It is like saying that a capitalist system needs a dictator to let it work. The market can do that a hundred times better than any other organization ever could. But lukily with the FED and ECB we don't have such problems right?


You want to be that dictator or what? Defaq man... 
You are really not any better than how fiat is forced up on all of us. People have to and will start to use bitcoin because of what it has to offer. People will understand that true being conservative or out of pure necessity in their lives. And bitcoin will be there for those people. People will not adopt because some party/leader/anarchist/evil banker want to do so. Even the card payments compared to cash goes not so fast in well established western countries. So how you expect people will adopt if they don't even understand what is wrong with there fiat currency, their system, the world the live in? 
Most likely bitcoin will be used by people who live in less "perfect" countries. Those start to adopt it. Western world keeps speculating on it too happen and slowly more and more capital flow into bitcoin. After this bust there will be another bubble suckering in more people and spreading the idea. It will bust again and so on for a countless times to come. The value will steadily increase as will the idea. More people will trust a small part (just 1% will be huge) of their capital too it. Given it a bit more validity and slowly the volatility will decreases. It will be the ultimate store of value for the next couple of decades and will easily outperform any other asset class.
After that volatility will start to be very low and people actually start to just pay with it instead of transferring to worthless fiat first.
@_date: 2018-12-13 10:19:46
I think with the right numbers it can really be something good.
The volatility makes a lot of swings so you can go in/out often and get those sweet returns. To see some simulations from different numbers in the last few years would really be interesting.

With a debt to gdp ratio of 105% they are awfully close.
Combine the fact that they dictate their "alleys/partners" about how they need to keep taking losses/hits it will be very likely that Russia, China and others will search for a way out. While they have been doing it by buying gold. But gold in today's world isn't the solution.
If those countries (And for Russia i have some hopes that they actually will) start to look into bitcoin and use that as a tool things can go quickly. IMO it will be the last time that the USD will be used as a hiding place for all other assets/currencies.

Only if it were true.
The price is determined by the available supply. Today there are 17.4 Mil sth bitcoin available. Those coins are setting the market price. 
Next halving will be ~329k coins in a year as reward. So what miners will mine in a whole year at today's prices/volumes will be traded in 6 hours.
So the idea of a halving which should have influence on the price will be much more a human brain factor than a real market demand/supply factor.

If i look at myself it is going to take a while. Between i got to known bitcoin for the first time to actually buying decent amounts was years. YEARS. Yes i regret that a little bit, but it does happen all the time.
If your millionaire you don't necessarily need bitcoin, often those people know pretty well how to earn decent amounts of money. Both through deflationary or inflationary periods. They know how to attract and keep wealth. Bitcoin will be used for that by such people in the future, but they are not wild speculators and directly throwing all their wealth into it.
The longer bitcoin exist the more it has proven itself. So slowly but surely it will attract more of such people. 


FYI for every seller there is a buyer, or did you think Coinbase is buying up all coins? Rich people have the confidence and patience to buy in cheaply while the average Joe buys only when the hype is real.

So taking capital across borders and directly being able to exchange i gives it zero intrinsic value? As imo it would be arguably the best options available at this moment.. That is just one of the many use cases giving bitcoin an actually use case and so does it give a little value.
That you can't give it an IV or don't see how it is valuable that can be.
As a value investor myself i acknowledge that it is not the same and not easily to set a price to that as compared to stocks. But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. IV is just a bit outdated term too, the biggest hotel facilitator may actually own zero hotels and giving the company a low IV compared to big hotel chains. But that actually isn't the case at all.
Internet technology companies are often very low in IV compared to many older companies and yet have probably hold at the moment the biggest real current intrinsic values. Look how Warren Buffett the biggest IV investor of all made this mistakes too and took him a very long time to adjust/acknowledge.

Its volatile because its so young and new. Even you have still no idea how important and valuable it is and will be. How you expect your bakery man will already do so? Even major economist are stuck by this new idea/concept.
Volatility will slowly decrease, bitcoin will firstly be indeed an addition to normal currencies. Like the USD or EUR is an additional currency in many poorer countries. Slowly bitcoin will take over that role, as it is a much better solution to their problem.
Slowly by slowly bitcoin will be used more and more, the volumes and prices will increase still a unbelievable amount before we will reach slow waters with less volatility and many trust. It has decades to come. See these volatility boom bust cycles as major catalyst to spread bitcoin. Every bubble will reach new extreme highs no one had imagined to dream of yet and the bust will keep coming to. But you see the pattern? It goes up extremely much in any measure anyway.
How you expected it would happen? Just a monthly 10% increase until we beat the gold market cap and eventually all world currencies?

The good thing is that this is actually a unique feature. It means that there are always people out that there who would really trust bitcoin and at a certain price (lets not think about if it is 1$ or 1000$) really support bitcoin with all they have.
Much like that gold might not interest many at today's prices. But at 1$ an ounce i for sure as hell get a decent stack.
Likely actually any new boom bust cycle will be higher for the next few cycles. Although now 20k seems out of reach, the next bull run will once again blow everyone's mind.

Yes, part of the adoption will be very high bitcoin prices. I do actually think big boom/busts will speed up adoption. In ten years it went from zero to \~$4000. Let see what the next 10 years will bring. Any cycle brings in more/new speculators but also it spread the idea. If i look at myself it took actually quiet a while for me to fully commit to this for myself. Seeing ATH's and nextly "bubbles" which are higher than last ATH's you have seen is pretty convincing in some way.

Mass adoption will come from people trusting bitcoin more than fiat and pushing the price up significantly making it a extremely valuable asset. Not from sending millions of bitcoin back and forth. A Paypal or Visa can always do that a thousand times better than bitcoin (or any shitcoin) ever will.

For a while i thought so too. But just think about the one billion € still printed daily 10 year after the crash. The next crisis is already knocking on the door, 1-2 billion will not cut it next time. Bitcoin is already better in that way.

Maybe in your country, in my country the branches are closing already for the last two decades. It wouldn't surprise me if only about 30% is left from ATH. This year there is even a new initiative to reduce the amount of ATM's considerably. 


I have to agree with that, but crypto already gave them a serious wake up call. The central bank of EU now is talking about making transactions going "live" through the system instead of one working day. But to be honest i think they are late to fight this new trend/threat.
Of course banks could improve their business even more and make it really consumer friendly. But with bitcoin you get back a Sovereignty no (central) banker can ever offer. Slowly more credit will be given to bitcoin and bankers one day or another will fack up with a big scam or bad management losing once again many billions of public money.

As far as i know they are incorporated in some countries with little or zero audit able responsibility. So they can do what they want and even the real ownership of all those shell companies is a mere guess. They also do operate a bunch of exchanges.
It is not even the question if they are fraudulent or not, they run a stable coin supposed to be fully backed. But it is just based on trust, as you could see earlier this year the trust is gone and you get like a 5-15% discount (also due to banking problems they had i suppose). 
So even when at that time they might have had a fully backed USDT, the market didn't believe it and you could really buy less bitcoin for your USDT holdings. 
I would rather trust my holdings at a major exchange in some better jurisdiction and which holds real fiat and does have audits and legitimate reports.

If the debt rises too much other people/countries lose trust in US(D). You will see how quickly shit hits the fan when that will happen.
You really expect a foreigner to put his wealth in the USD inflating at 10% a year while he can choose bitcoin with a lower inflation rate for example? Yes bitcoin is not ready yet i know, but it will happen sooner rather than later. People who flee their own currency are not that stupid to put it in something else as bad.
Most likely the USD will be used as the last time to safely put capital in in the next crisis. The trust isn't really there and new much better options are available and will put to use by more and more people which making it much better real soon.

I would not tell to leave it at an exchange. But to say "hack easily" i think your underestimating the current state of some exchanges. Use a proper exchange which at least shouldn't be able to be hacked easily. There are some decent ones out there. Don't use shitty exchanges in the first place.

Great idea although i had been searching for it in the past. Although i think the bidding part of ebay is rather small compared to the buy now part. But do both will be best option i guess.

I looked at the prices and i see transactions. Someone is selling and someone else is buying. Like it was at 0.10$ at $100 or at $19500. One is buying while the other is selling.

It is very likely that bitcoin can have another 30-50% downturn at that point. But does it really matter at this point? Even let say major panic breaks out and many people run to the exit to "safe" their stash in some good old fiat.
Bitcoin is at $1000 at that point, it is still working fine though. Sooner or later big wealth will understand that bitcoin will not be destroyed, they too will get in to protect their wealth of what is coming. 
The next recession will most likely show the world how wonderful bitcoin can actually be. Although the search liquidity will firstly test us holders to the max, eventually the true benefits of bitcoin will come to light.
How people will feel about those people having only a daily cash withdrawal limit of 50$ from their bank while a bit-coiner has free access to his total stash and could get his hands on it at any time? Bitcoin will be much needed to go through the next major recession.

You don't lose anything as you have exactly what you paid for before.

Its not the same though. Compare two countries, America and Swiss.
If America starts to directly print money to ease the bond market and have some other endeavors in countries they have nothing to do in the first place. All is happy and they can do all they want. But if Swiss doesn't ruin their country it means that the exchange rate would eventually change, this might not really what Swiss want as they also want to stay competitive. 
So now Swiss also decides to print money. But instead of going to fight in other countries or letting the government run huge deficits it decided to just print money and buy all American assets availble on the open market (bonds, RE, stocks, whatever they like).
Who you think seriously will be better of after years of mismanagement? Fun facts, do check some European holdings by governments.
And because Swiss is running their government better they can borrow more money on the market for a lower interest and use that to once again buy assets.
So tell me how it all doesn't matter and all is the same?

Besides the dollar risk you also have an extra risk of them being insolvent or the market thinking they are (look for example at the discounts this year, if the ratio is 0.85 in open market you lose money, even while they might be funded fully).

So switch bank accounts instead. I have used coinbase all the time they gave me the bitcoin directly. What i did was sending fiat with a sepa transaction and on business days the transaction credited in a few hours. After that i could buy bitcoin and send it to whatever address directly.
Coinbase is not giving you full access of "your" bitcoin as your bank didn't really fully settled the transaction wire.. Blame your bank instead!

Any free market has a boom and bust cycle.
The problem is the capital markets in every country around the world isn't operated as a free market but as some kind of tool which economist think they can steer by trying new things every cycle. They think they are financial wizards who can fix those cyclical turns.
Why gold has no cyclical nature? Did you study it from the past 5k year performance? 
The best cyclical example in my mind i think is the Pork cycle.

I have been using Bing for years. But to be honest in my region search results often are a bit disappointing. Together with a VPN, bitcoin and duckduckgo i made a serious commitment to not only complain at the "wrongs" in the world but also to act accordingly :)

Not really working i suppose. There are a lot of parties who are just fine with higher transaction fees. So they automatically increase the fees in times when it is needed (exchanges for example). So the fee price shoot up, while low fee transactions pile up the spammy transaction maker needs also to increase his spending making it a costly endeavor. 
And what they will accomplish? We had already high fees ones and we are still going strong. Yes high fees might not be preferable and temporarily some tx can/will be done by other coins. But when things change to normal we just go back to business as usual.
BCH is mostly a social attack in my opinion. They try to sell shitcoins which they control to the unkown as the "real" bitcoin. Many had fallen for it but by now (i hope) they learned their lesson. Yes they lost their money, but they would have probably anyway. We can only do as much as inform/warn them.

I don't even know why i will try, but it might help some others.
Yes US holds its own currency and in that way it would never have a problem as it can just prints its debt away. I understand that and in that sense a 105% debt isn't the worst thing. But US also runs worlds reserve currency and many people holding worthless paper while US is benefiting (stealing) through inflation from those people. In that way they have lived above standards for the last century.
But think about it. If US starts to inflate the debt away with several Trillions at the time, raising inflation, lowering the worthiness of the dollar. What do you think will happen with the country/economy/paper money/trust ?? If a Ukrainian citizen living in a 25% inflationary country holds his wealth in usd at 2-3% inflationary, he can both hold USD as debt. But as soon as the USD starts to abuse this status while there is a new hard currency (bitcoin) which starts to inflate at less than those levels while being more secure, trust-able, usable, etc. You think those people aren't going to hop over to a stronger currency which isn't attacking their own country?
Major holdings in both paper worthless US money and US debt are hold from abroad. A fractional reserve system works well under times when there is trust. As soon as the trust is broken the whole system will collapse (look at the history of money). Undeniably bitcoin will have a better track record for the next hundred years than US or the dollar will ever see.
You can already see small shifts and it is just the very beginning, trust in US around the world isn't that high. But yet for now they run the most trust-able currency and in the next crisis it will be the place most capital will run/flee. But don't think for a second that will stay this way forever and you can't even dream about a 250% debt to gdp for America.

I think you meant public key? Private keys should be/stay private (only available for you). 
Bitcoin really is wonderful, it will/can do so many things. Your transaction is just a small portion of its features. 
By the way it is not entirely anonymous, as it is an open ledger. If you bought it on an exchange with your bank/credit card and used ID's its not so much anonymous at all. So it depends much on how you use it, normally people call it pseudonymous.
Some information to keep your off drugs and occupied with this wonderful thing:

They have people "working" in their to make it look more legit how they have such an easy business with massive gains without providing much to the world.
Of course it shouldn't be off by a penny, would you then still trust them?
They process a lot of transactions and ask dearly to do so and not at all "on time". It might take days to make a transaction and lets not even talk about the servers not working outside business hours.
It is not a small time bank, it is a nation wide bank with massive influence in the world finance (Libor scandal, massive laundry, selling customers bad mortgages, selling complicated interest rate swaps etc).

Bitcoin isn't for anyone.
How you calculate the true value of your fiat? As it is merely worth the paper it is printed on.
Even stocks are very hard to really value correctly, otherwise the prices wouldn't part from their value so much in times.. Even for stocks just the interest level, which is manipulated heavy by (central) banks really make a big difference in price valuations. So you know what interest levels the central bank will set in let say 5 years?
Think more of price valuations like gold. Where bitcoin still has a long way to go (so both the risk/gains will far exceed that of gold in the coming decades)! And if you understand the fundamentals of bitcoin (lowering inflation rate) you will see that you can value bitcoin even better than gold as gold has an unknown inflationary rate too and is heavily influenced once again by (central) bankers.

A stock market crash could indeed make a run for liquidity in all markets, as before and all will run to USD.
But a stock market crash would also high lighten bitcoin for the first time as SoV and a new place to hide wealth from the bad. So while short term it is likely that bitcoin would hurt as well, it is also possible (although not proven yet of course) that bitcoin might come out as a real "winner" in the end.
Just think how people will react when the banks start again this bullshit as they shown in 08/09. How people will feel about ATM withdrawal limits, frozen (all kind of) accounts, while bitcoin holders will have fully access and freedom over their capital? 
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:50:39


And what would you make think that then the transitioning to a "safe government backed" fiat currency would suddenly be switched for bitcoin? Lets be honest, even i do think that cash/card/paypal/online payments are done better and more conveniently than bitcoin is at the moment.
Remember that i did read all kinds of economic books and know the (fraudulent) system pretty darn well. Putting savings or paying huge bills through bitcoin is really a totally uncomparable step than going from Government fiat cash to their digital currency.

How bitcoin could actually die? Besides a technical part which i think is unlikely.

Impossible. Every market is machine traded and that does happen already for a long time.
Housing market for example is mainly traded by humans i suppose, is that really any better? 
Machine trading gives very equal markets (low margin fast arbitrage), small spreads due to automatic bots running as market makers.. All those bots bring lots of liquidity. 
I don't really see how it would ever be possible to human trade everything. How you would do margin trading or shorting (with the need of automated liquidations, to keep the margins).
If you see a big rise or crash it is often a combination of events; bots getting wild, liquidation through an margin trade, short squeeze, etc. On such event other bots like arbitrage for example or just algorithms, or trading bots with certain buy/sell levels all react in a very short time.
Why it is so much in bitcoin and less in other markets? I think because its still very young, no real professional market makers, young exchanges, bad exchanges, bad actors, no good regulation, etc etc.
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:02:59
By my knowledge almost any empire or otherwise always successfully forced their currency on the normal folks. Remember that in the US even all gold was pretty successfully taken from the public. That was many times harder than introducing a new fed coin.

Nothing is gone, the last time i checked all bitcoins are still there.
Some might have lost access by losing the keys. But that doesn't matter does it? It just means that the total available supply is less which increases the value of all available coins. In the extreme worst case scenario even just 1 bitcoin is still enough, after all you can just keep dividing it further as much as we do need so.
So next time keep better track of your keys instead of blaming btc..

Hard to say if it is really undervalued, as you can't really put traditional measures on it to calculate the value.
Nice goal and at your age and with your ability to take risks i think it is a very good idea! Stay hungry, set big goals, learn as much as you can! Learn from your mistakes.
And such "small" investments are never a bad idea. Rather think about how you can make another 200 euro by doing some kind of a job or something. Be creative and have an entrepreneurial mindset! 
Also invest some money into the book "the bitcoin standard", well worth the money to get that knowledge at your age!

Today in the last 24 hour 4.6 Billion dollar has been traded in bitcoin. If there are no buyers the price would be close to zero in seconds. Yes the general trend might be still bearish for long. But with an average of such trading volumes we would be close to zero for the next 10 years.
But by all means, short it through zero if you think there are no buyers left.
Just like we started, as you just bullshit yourself and no one else.

Speculators yes, but miners/mining reward it self will have very few influence by now (or then). Even if they drop it at the second they receive the coins the current market can easily handle those coins and would hardly move the market up or down.

It is sickening that hard working tax payers can pick up his bill in the end.

Yea a good idea.
There is some wikipedia page about bank changes in/after the financial crisis. It is pretty crazy to see. In those times they prepare for another cycle and they are ever increasing "too big to fail"..
Luckily we have learned a lot from the past, LOL!

A few times a month by billions of people still adds up quickly though.

If your still acquiring or wanting to acquire more lower prices actually helps you.
As long as you like the product and the product is still as good with lower prices the lower price is just even better. Who wouldn't like 2 beers for the price of one? 
With investing a strange thing normally happens in the human brain and that is that we like higher prices instead of lower. If the prices rise after you bought it feels like a conformation of what you knew already. But its illogical and unneeded if you buy for the long term.

Funny how gold and sex correlate, so the more gold i amass the more sex i will get?
Politicians really have to start worrying though.

Exactly this.

Yea i did the same. They have a standard 1k minus policy on the debitcard and i asked them to block this. It wasn't easy but i know it is possible.
Why i should spent money in minus while having a zero interest savings account there so they can charge a 10-12% interest while i do have the money? They are annoying af.
Since i am more concerned about the payment trackings/privacy i do pay more in cash again.

Just learn to not spent it on useless stuff.
Converting to Tether seems rather risky. Anyway getting in and out of the market might be risky, as you might find yourself and never get a opportunity to get in again. If you don't really need it i think its best to ride it all the way. Maybe cash some out in what you think is the top to get an extra cash stack again.

One day this will be written about (central) bankers, fractional reserve banking, asset inflation, debt slavery, fiat currencies and wars. What a great day that must be to read.
Although i think it will take more time than it took this to be debunked.
