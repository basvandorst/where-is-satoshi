My favourite is [Paid Books]( (Full disclosure: that's a referral link)
300 satoshi every 10 minutes, no tricks that I have seen. Payout when you reach 20000 (but I have got payouts at lower amounts too)
And you ca actually read the books if you want to.

The whole idea of people manufacturing and selling these ASICs seems strange to me. Ripe for scams.
Think of it as a machine that prints money. Not forged money, totally legit dollars, euros or whatever. 
You wouldn't sell it would you? Only if you expect to make more cash selling than you can expect to make using it yourself over its lifetime.
The other side of the coin is, as a buyer, I would ALWAYS have to be suspicious of anyone wanting to sell such a machine for exactly the same reason.

You mean those "volunteers" who who work for and are paid by Blockstream?

Bitcoin's security is based mostly on 51% of the miners behaving themselves. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:44:54
Nope it will give us about 1.75x the number of Tx fitting in a block.

SW moves the limit to effectively 1.75MB max, and that's only when ALL wallets have been updated to use the new features.

Since when is Jeff Garzik a newbie?

The code for the size increase is up and anyone can get it and compile it themselves. Things like version strings haven't been done yet though IIRC.

Speaking as someone in favour of BU... he ain't an authority to me or IMO most of us and his pool is very far from controlling anything.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:35:00
The last one was fixed by the BU devs. It took the Toddler's irresponsible public disclosure to make it an issue. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:16:57
Not true. Plenty of valid BU blocks have been generated and are part of the blockchain already.

Lightning is nowhere near ready to go unless you like centralized hub and spoke solutions run by large well funded corporations.
@_date: 2017-01-26 11:23:42
Waste of time. The situations are not remotely similar.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:16:59
Where's the break? Genuinely asking.
@_date: 2017-01-26 09:58:02
Sure that whole situation there is solved. Huzzah for walls. /s
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:10:02
And we didn't even need Segwit to do it!

LN requires a blocksize limit increase. 
@_date: 2017-04-28 20:05:39
So compile it yourself and compare the hashes.

So Gavin Andresen doesn't understand how bitcoin works? You really must be a toddler if you think that.

Mods here could silence doubt by simply opening their mod logs (as is done in the other place) but they have ignored calls to do so. That, plus the double standards in rule enforcement, CSS tampering, and other practices seem pretty definitive to me. YMMV
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:22:14
Yeah, but in only one sub will you be b4anned for tripping over a keyword or commiting thoughtcrime.
