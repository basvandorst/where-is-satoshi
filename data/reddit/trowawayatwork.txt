bitcoin is pegged to the dollar, not the other way around, until then expect everything to be done on USD value. 
the only way to get around the fluctuation of usd value of bitcoin is to   put the btc in holding until there is a resolution and not immediately limit their exposure by dumping btc. that way that same btc can be used for resolution

Murray Rothbard was a libertarian and argued that governments were an organisation of robbery and opposed central banking. which is everything that BTC stands for: decentralisation. 
Your argument is based on a capitalist debt driven model where under btc/gold standard deflation punishes debtors and lenders profit. What is there to say that this model will be the case in 20-100 years?
FOr profiteering and encouraging expansion and booms the inflationary model is the best way forward, but take a look at  the price of gold the instant, shit hits the fan, everyone suddenly loves gold again. It doesnt matter what you use as currency, under the current way the world runs every way will profit the 1%, in this case you are right the deflationary model will profit the 1% more.

Mtgox goes down because its its a shoddy exchange. there is a void. blockchain makes its own exchange, that hopefully adheres to all regulations and security measures, and runs it smoothly and securely to establish a global brand and trading platform for bitcoin.

found out about this when neo and bee went live in cyprus. Since no news the price is dropping off again after the initial rush of people seeking quick profits as usual.

supposedly it can be used to peg anything. therefore when etf for these things come out and DAC are working you can use bitshares to peg anything. Since theres no capabilities to actually use it at the moment it is obviously worthless. vitaly buterin will tell you about worthless and ethereum.
I have not got any btsx and reading heavyuser1337's link it is a bit overhyped. however its already 4th on cmarketcap and doesnt follow the usual pnd pattern. It may go up in value more before it more likely than not fails.

Thats not what im saying. I am saying were the prices the same as first few years in the current market volume all on one market the overreaction would not be as great because the currency is worthless to them in the beginning. there would not be as many overpanicked suiciders dropping 3000 btc for 100$ as they did earlier this morning (Open to debate if it was intentional or not obviously)

The guy sounds a bit butthurt. also he hinges his argument on 'bitcoins are mined through wasted computer time'. That wasted computer time allows decentralisation.

To paraphrase Andreas 'I send $5 to a friend standing next to me, it cost me $0.5. The I realised I could send $150 million dollars to someone on the other side of the world and it would still cost me $0.5. That is what were doing here'
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:35:12


Andreas answered that with a wider acceptance of the currency liquidity pools will increase. Theres a video i cant find that has some economist trying to put down bitcoin and andreas just destroys him. quite funny the economist was there just going awa awa awa awa.


that part is in perspective. but look at the price, look at neo bee. seems pretty stable at the moment.


this is the main problem that i see. the sticking point is that protocol 1.0 will have to be really airtight but the fact that people are used to making stupid/deceptive decisions and just have the ability to basically rollback transactions which general population has gotten used to. Fraud has always happened and will happen. breakthrough will come when though education and security go hand in hand to prevent online fraud.

if you cut off at 100k btc then stop at 13th and you have about 4.4m btc/12.95m in circulation = 34%

they could easily dump their stakes plummeting the price and scoop up cheap coins and get more of the market share etc.

you are going past fundamental principles and building your own theoretical hypotheses, even though they apply in real terms today with the 1% and all. 
a bank fails in the region of 1 trillion, governement gives it money. government did not do anything but take money out of the vault. bank fails again, government prints it money. The government didnt negotiate any deals or put its workforce in overdrive, it just printed more money. Now if satoshi was governemnt. he support the bank once after that he cannot generate more bitcoins out of thin air. Thats the spend once principle not any subcategories of wealth generation or accumulation through spending. 
Your point is in real terms of course satoshi would never be poor again as long as bitcoin exists. However if the fed operated in bitcoin the american economy would not have been able to bail out the bank and keep pumping money into the economy. No way no how. Government cannot go into a wealth accumulation route when its money is tied up in helping the economy.
If you use money to make money id be pooping out gold right now. if satoshi sold his 1m btc now the value of btc would be about 1$ again. and the accumulation of wealth to see appreciation in value is a much debated inflation which we will not go into. without that there is only the real appreciation in value where the rate of spending it does not appreciate enough to not be able to spend the money. ONce again its the fundamental theoretical structure of currency to which in your arguments you are applying real life principles.
You may be right in real terms but fundamentals persist that he can only spend it once, which is less effective than being able to print money.

If there is a wider acceptance then competition will increase decreasing fees and skimming as you call it the market is so new the existing exchanges and merchants can afford to make profits.
concerning slippage if the same as any currency exchange, if you send usd to thailand you ahve to change it baht anyway and you lose way more money there. The way bitcoin beats this is when more vendors will start accepting bitcoin and then you dont have to lose my by changing it into btc.
In term of security concerns you just need to educate yourself on how to keep your btc safe. Unless youre as dumb/smart as karpeles, pretty hard to imagine, then you can keep your btc safe pretty easily.

You behaved like the perfectly irrational trader. This is why why markets are volatile because or irrational human input. You live and you learn. Keep the bitcoin you have, unless you need it for food (in which case leave the market completely), read a basic investment book. Then take the basic lessons from it. If you feel confident come back to bitcoin. 
First lesson is dont put all your eggs in one basket.
However I cannot reiterate this enough. bitcoin is not here for price speculation. It is here to be used as a currency.

Get off your pedestal my friend. The fees are entry barriers put up by people who want to scalp for the fact that everyone is rushing into bitcoin now before it becomes mainstream. I am not giving this to you as fact I am saying thats a lot of stuff that ive read. If/when btc gets established entry should be easy in theory. HOwever you and me know there will be transaction charges on top of other charges. what youre telling me is everyone is wiling to pay more for the decentralisation?

This is because the bank know that your money is directly proportional and heavily influences their assets. They can get out a loan based purely on the fact that you deposited $150m with them. normal citizens bankroll banks' investment arms. If they lose that money and have to pay back their debt you pay, both in terms of damaged economy and loss of money. both are cold hard facts.
Also in the UK they now ask you what it is that you want to withdraw your money for if its above £5000. What does anyone care what its for , its not the banks money.
The point isnt how much money you can send, its the fact you can do it without trusting anyone and almost instantly (Pending confirmations :D).

youre not seeing the bigger picture.
the acceptance of btc goes beyond buying it right now and trying to buy somethign online with it at a loss.
you konw all the concepts that make it better already. now integration of society towards such a currency would mean you can do a deed and receive bitcoin, not fiat. then you can buy something with that at reduced prices because merchant fees have been eliminated and the retailer can 1-5% reduced prices.

that makes the most sense. the chocking and marketing part is that the option to use btc in the mainstream places simply wont be there, it will be restricted to boutique places. Even the current merchants, do they hold on to the btc because they see value? no they never even own any, it gets exchanged immediately into fiat and into their account, they are just using it to bring more business. There are of course merchants who see the light with btc and i hope their numbers will increase

I do agree with you i misconstrued wording. if i did, many others probably did too, no?

I am no bitcoin shill but I tried to read and understand what the whole ether thing is about, the 'smart contracts' the smart whatever else.
Essentially ethereum is somehting different to bitcoin. Ether is its internal currency that powers the said 'contracts'. only 17% of it will be mined in the first year. like what? seriosuly? then the people who have given over 6k btc to buy ether have not got any ether yet. the disclaimer also stipulates that they reserve the right to use 4.5k btc to make the project work.
Vitaly et al have taken 4.5k btc and said you waiver your right to get it back if the project fails. essentially everyone who bought ether has not actually bought any. there is a possibility you wont get it at all and theres nothing you can do about it.This is just my interpretation of it, i could be completely wrong.
Anyway you cannot trade this ether outside of the ethereum ecosystem as the ether is used to 'execute' these contracts. So essentially you are going to slave away building a contract in order to be paid in ether which you cant really trade with outside the ecosystem unless you can sell it for btc?
Also, lets not forget that this was a PREMINE! I think poor Vitaly has outsmarted himself on this one.

Fair point on tx costs.
The vision is that, if allowed to be used as a currency, people can pay for daily things using btc. that way eliminating costs of transferring to $ or any other currency. Valuation is in $ because its easier for people to understand that way.

Block size should not be as big an issue as it is. Look at the mined blocks, every few hours there's a block with 0 tx. Miners rush for reward rather than make a sensible network. How about the protocol makes a rule for a block to contain % of tx In the waiting pool. Or some shit like that. No they still want to increase block size. When they eventually do increase block size there still will be empty blocks mined.
There are plenty other things like that that are less visible and also swept under the rug. 
In Bitcoin, the success of Bitcoin is a secondary objective, profit is primary

disproving your own words. which you dont even understand when trying to answer with your word salad.

Watch and see is shit contribution to FOSS. You’re a corporate cuck for doing that.
Also your examples of proprietary forks is indicative of you being anti FOSS.
Also it doesn’t matter about cucks like you. The contribution difference is still Day and night between btc and bch. I am sure there are as many wait and see, private leeching corps, sitting on top of FOSS not contributing anything back in bitcoin as there are, if any, on bch.
So yes, what you said is word salad as it’s irrelevant to the differences in code contribution, you tried to allude to. The fact remains there are infinitely more contributors, since there are 0 in BCH for the last month.

Why cant you hold them in usd and exchange what you need into PKR? the only thats happened in the last 10 years is prk depreciated against the dollar. eg in uzbekistan the som is a joke currency, everyone gravitates towards the usd, similar in russia but the euro is also available there. 
If you are being owed 50k USD i am pretty sure you have the means to set up a US account, or some sort of dollar account which has visa and then then you can just pay for everything with your card, although not sure what card charges are like in pakistan, which  you can use to cash out USD with from eg bitstamp/coinbase or whoever is the reputable exchange (IMO none of them have any decent integrity)
Also watch out for an genuine bitcoin debit card Onebit as youve prob seen on front page. They are trying to go through legit channel to get to work with mastercard.
