Sorry, but this doesn't make sense at all. It's not that the crypto's all went down to 0. The only thing that happend is weak hands all over the world gave in to the FUD of one country. You implicate that only the South Koreans sold their crypto ("a drop in the bucket"). The crypto in it's total is not controlled or rather influenced by a government, only the weak hands are influenced by the FUD of a government. Which means that indeed the crypto took a dive, but it didn't go to 0. So in a way it has a great resilience since the price did not go under €7500. That's still a lot of value imo.

You are not wrong there! 
However that's why you should keep your assets in an offline wallet. That was the original idea of cryptocurrency to begin with. Decentralisation. The exchanges or rather the opportunity that people see in making more money, makes it centralised which is why it will be influenced by the government as you said. Sad but true nevertheless.
Strangely enough the more popular the cryptos become, the more centralised it will be due to the exchanges. which counteracts the real reason why crypto became a thing.

Well it's not all on the korean news tbh. 
China FUD as well + the futures on bitcoin that set of a chain reaction.

Or the official just wanted to earn a quick buck...

This actually could be it. I also thought that there were actual bitcoins on the network. Thanks for the clearification!

Thanks a lot! That's exactly the question that needed to be answered. I also thought it's not possible to print a bitcoin, only the private and public key that make up the wallet. 
The problem now is, we both know it's not possible. But I need to prove that these jurists are wrong. I cannot just state that they are wrong and say why. I do need a reliable source which confirms what you just wrote. Do you by any chance have read a paper  that confirms this? That would be a great help!
Thanks for the answer !

No no need for apologies! :) I wasn't feeling attacked. 
Well I would like to link it but I can only access the article via my university VPN. Also it's in Dutch so I guess that will also be a barrier. But I can quote and translate it for you if you want. But that will be for tomorrow. It's 01h30 am in Belgium and I need to be up in 3 hours. 
I will get back to you asap! Thanks for the responses !

I know what a private key is and what a paper wallet is. I know the basics of bitcoin and Blockchain. 
My question only arised because of the two articles that states that you can print out a bitcoin on paper (they specifically were not talking about the paper wallet)
I hope this clearifies things.

Thank you very much for the explanation and for the paper. I certainly will give it a read!

"The result of the "mining" process is a property right to an improper good. The bitcoin has no physical existence in principle. The code that is hidden behind the bitcoin can be printed and as a security
be transferred, but this is only an exceptional one
"Het resultaat van het «mining»-proces is een eigendomsrecht op een onlichamelijk goed. De bitcoin kent in principe geen fysiek bestaan. De code die schuilgaat achter de bitcoin kan wel afgedrukt worden en zo als waardepapier
overgedragen worden, maar dit is slechts een uitzonderlijk
I think this is the correct translation. For completion you also have the dutch version. 
With the "code that is hidden behind the bitcoin" he does not mean the coding to create bitcoin via solving the complex "mathematical problems". He actually means the code that a bitcoin has.

I guess I wasn't really clear with my question. I don't need to know if you can print the coding of bitcoin. I need to know if you can print a bitcoin itself. Like the coin itself. The question actually is: can you make a bitcoin physical by printing the code that is one (or a fraction of a) bitcoin. 
I thought this was not possible but two authors claim the opposite. 
I will edit the topic. 
But thanks for the quick responses!
