Both are European exchanges so can deal with EUR/BTC. Both are also segwit enabled exchanges so fees can be smaller.

Seems like your computer was not as secure as you thought it was. I'd recommend learning how to use Linux (can still be hacked but seems more secure than Windows) and then compile electrum from source (not really that difficult, just read the readme from their GitHub).
You've still got 2 BTC and can flip that around once again.

In Estonia we have private keys on our government issued national id cards. Say I want to vote - I put my id card into a smart card reader on my pc, go to the government portal, login by authenticating myself via pin1 cast my vote and then sign it with pin2 for my card. Haven't really heard of any cases of people selling their id-cards and pin codes since the pins don't work without the card and any digital signature signed with the pin2 is as legally binding as a regular signature, so you're putting yourself at risk of taking a huge loan or whatever. 
  
Plus you lose out on other neat things like logging into your bank and making payments, logging in to your utility (isp, electricity, water, etc) company's website and being able to pay bills almost immediately.

Coinbase is partnered with a completely Estonian bank named LHV. Just because Danske's Estonian branch was doing shit does not mean any other banks in the country do the same.

How, BCH was enabled on coinbase/gdax yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:43:10
Coinbase ain't that bad, at least you can get verified there as opposed to others - Kraken at least outright says verification is disabled, other exchanges just seem to be sending verification requests into /dev/null.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:45:54
Yeah. Client -gives x btc + y btc in fees -&gt; bitstamp -converts it to usd and sends -&gt; steam.
The problem as outlined in the steam post was because of large transaction fees (to get the payment in a timely manner) and sometimes the predetermined time frame for the payment would run out and the client would have to send the missing funds but now for whatever the new price for that time window is.

I use greenbits on Android. Seems nice, open and has segwit (lower fees on transactions) support. If you're on iOS, I've heard breadwallet is neat.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:45:44
Good luck getting verified anywhere else at this point of time.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:42:22
Pretty much but you'd probably accrue more fees while converting to Fiat and back to crypto

How to unbuy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:42:20
I would advise against using coinbase when you're underage since that breaks their terms of service and is grounds for disabling your account. Make a paperwallet and buy from someone locally or use any other method that doesn't require you to be over 18.

If someone doesn't know what the acronym stands for DCA - Dollar Cost Averaging - buy some this week, buy some next week, buy some the week after that. Or whichever timeframe you choose. You can lower your potential risk by gradually putting money on crypto but you also might lose out on a bigger reward by not going all in earlier.
