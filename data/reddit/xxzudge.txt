I hope everyone loses their coins except for me.  Then we can divide mine into satoshis and I can be really rich.

He is gone and I didn't even get to downvote him. :/

I used Notepad++ for a really long time until I made the switch to Geany.

This is just not a sound argument.

Love you guys, too! &lt;3

I didn't know!  I guess I don't spend enough time on the forum.

He is old.

I sold a BTC on Mt. Gox and withdrew money over a year ago.  I was not required to provide a drivers license, etc, but I did provide my banking information to make the USD withdrawal.
Can someone explain if I am at risk here?
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:01:54
Most comments seem to believe that.  I just don't doubt that Mt. Gox had terrible security implementation.  You are most likely right, though.

I hope this 'hodl' verb isn't something sexual....

Its meant to be scalable.  You can use whatever you need to.  Maybe in the future we'll have to use satoshis, but it would be unpractical at the moment.  The value of 1 BTC needs to rise drastically before using satoshis really become relevant.

Its not quite the same thing at all.

Under the guise of freedom to keep the population happy and complacent.  I think that makes it even more dangerous than totalitarian/authoritarian governments of the past.

Can you choose a seed?  What are the chances of sometime randomly getting the same seed that was given to you?
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:44:22
You are probably right when considering his general attitude about the state, etc.

I think it is far too early in the life of Bitcoin to call it a hell of a disadvantage.  This cold war you speak of will probably be in the history books before Bitcoin will be able to make a difference for them.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:26:17
You don't understand what I'm saying.  I didn't mean to assert that Indian using Bitcoin won't help them.  I was simply pointing out that the entire net worth of Bitcoin is 12 billion dollars.  That entire amount still isn't enough money to pay them through a cold war with China.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:30:51
That is the split we're referring to. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:15:29
I don't have enough energy to argue semantics.

Couldn't agree more.  Not only will a domain be unable to be seized, but a ton of peers can't 'go down' like your DNS servers can.  Amazing innovation in my opinion.  I would love to see namecoin replace dns in the future.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:56:50
I'm by no means an expert in any field but that makes a lot of sense to me. Plus bitcoin won't be able to function globally with 21 million coins. They will have to be split to keep their value. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:47:50
*face palm*
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:07:53
Even if the entire bitcoin market of ~12 billion dollars was solely in the hands of the Indians it wouldn't make the difference.

He clearly doesn't understand the implications of the block chain.  Bitcoin is backed by the amazing feat of computer science that is the block chain and Satoshi should have a Nobel Peace prize. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:36:35
Yeah the blockchain is the real value of bitcoin.  Namecoin is the best thing to come out of the blockchain to date in my opinion, but the possibilities are limitless.
