Thank you. I can really feel your pain. I tried having an intelligent conversation with a family member on bitcoin recently. Was told 'not to invest more than 10% of my portfolio into it'. Was told what a 'currency' is vs. what a 'commodity' is. Was told how it's all super speculative, like gambling. And then when I explained how China clamping down on exchanges didn't mean bitcoin was illegal there, and how I'd even benefited a bit from the drop in prices I was told I was merely lucky, not smart, not wise, never insightful, never a good thinker, never a skilled researcher, nope. Nothin'. Oh, and then when I explained to him a bunch of the aspects of bitcoin he seemed to misunderstand (like the difference between regulation of exchanges and the notion that some entity could regulate the protocol itself) he basically told me I was going off the deep end and that this subject was 'too important to me' for me to be able to continue discussing it in email. I've determined it's not worth it for me to keep trying with this particular family member; best seek out those who would ponder and reflect and hash things out with me, and leave alone those who would demean, dismiss, and belittle me.
I wish you many affirming experiences in the future, my friend, and I believe you will have them. That's what we all deserve, those of us with the forethought, the sharp perception, the ability to take risks, and most especially the determination to empower ourselves and others through these amazing new opportunities that bitcoin and its underlying protocol offer.
All the best.

Beautiful article. Saving for posterity. Will read nightly like scripture. ;)
I seriously feel we've entered a singularly of sorts with cryptocurrency; while things appear to be changing and progressing gradually, it feels like momentum is building and that under the surface things are accelerating like crazy.
I feel both ecstatic about what's happening and maddened by the dearth of perceivable, visceral changes in the world I am still living in in this day-to-day manner.
I suspect I am not alone in this in terms of feeling both very excited and also impatient with the pace of the revolutionary/evolutionary process we're witnessing and partaking in.

You're probably right that 3 levels aren't necessary. However, if you want to obfuscate your wallet files, I believe 2 levels are more-or-less needed. For one, I always encrypt my coin-client wallet, secondly 7-Zip with filename obfuscation requires a second password. (You could do this with just one password.)

I think the fact that there is a limited quantity of bitcoins for people to buy means that they would have to buy that amount of bitcoins in smallish chunks in order to acquire that much. Plus, as they do this, other day traders will notice the big buy orders on the exchanges and act accordingly. Basically, I think the system, the network, and the value are all pretty resilient, evidenced by the fact that despite all the bad press and the mtgox issue lately, the value remains near 600, where last year it was worth much much less than this. I don't think a single entity could manipulate the entire bitcoin network value away, certainly could put a big dent in it, but the impact is certainly going to be limited in a market worth 8 to 10 billion dollars. That's my take on it anyways.

My response to Brian:


The Core Devs view themselves as the protectors of the people and are (or seem to be) ok with watching bitcoin fail, you say? This means you believe that they are not, in fact, protecting the people who use, live, and breathe bitcoin, doesn’t it? (At least I assume you believe this to be true…)
Do you really think they would sit idly by while bitcoin failed — or do you think that there’s a chance they could actually be committed, passionate, and capable people who can save bitcoin, and help it grow and thrive?
The case you highlighted about blocks filling up after a hypothetical post-halving block-reward-reduction-based miner-hashrate decrease is exaggerated. You’ve admitted as much yourself that such an occurrence is unlikely to come to pass. There will not be one single block of miners of significant size who are profitable only at $425, and at no less than this amount. Miners come online all the time. Some (increasingly more) people mine just to heat their homes. 21.co’s computers and infrastructure will ramp up. Brazilian/Paraguayan mining will pick up shortly. These miners will come online with bitcoin at $350, $400, $450, $500 — whatever the price happens to be. Not every miner runs at cost without reserves to pay for fluctuations in the price of bitcoin in relation to electricity costs. Your red herring is irrelevant.
As far as I’m concerned, the Bitcoin Core Roadmap is just fine. Any smart and discontented party such as yourself can — as is the nature of open-source projects — just take the good parts, leave the bad, and create a new crypto-coin with the desired parameters, blocksize, etc. And who’s to stop you?
What I don’t understand is how the Bitcoin Core Devs are — in essence — any different as a bunch than Linux kernel developers. I mean, the Linux guys are known for their ‘hostility’, incivility, crassness, mutual-taunting, and exclusivity. But this doesn’t mean Linux is doomed to fail. On the contrary, Linux is stronger because of the contentious issues, the internal tension, the teasing, the dearth of political correctness, the lopsided prioritizations of its most influential custodians — and it will continue to be strong for this reason. I see Bitcoin as no different in the sense that it defies expectations, is contentious and hotly-debated, lit up with scandals and rumors, and surrounded by FUD.
Bring on the debate. Bring on the scandals. Bitcoin can take it.

You are not alone. I totally agree. 
I'm pro-core roadmap. And I also understand the criticisms leveled at core and the core roadmap. I believe r/bitcoin has gone totally hyperbolic and the divisiveness that has been fomented here has rendered pointless any attempts to debate rationally and meaningfully about the merits of the proposed solutions. Therefore, I've largely divested from the conversations here and await patiently the rolling out of new features to core. Eventually, I believe this maelstrom will subside and that bitcoin will ultimately survive this temporal drama. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:13:51
Don't let it ruin your faith. I'd bet half of this drama has been manufactured or fomented by agent provocateurs.

As a new technology, Bitcoin offers fringe benefits for people on the fringes. This is a  good thing. And it is not devoid of potential for people in the mainstream either, but they might be ignorant of this fact, sometimes willfully so. 
But the truth is we don't need the approval of 'The People' for Bitcoin to mature and develop into a fully fledged, programmable, and robust asset transfer and currency protocol. It is only 7 years old at this point. I suspect people will be talking down to it for quite a while, at least until after it goes through puberty.

I think you're wrong here actually. Having food stolen is something that happens to farmers and it doesn't mean they just quit. 
While I was volunteering in rural Nicaragua the people in our community got word of thieves in a neighboring community a few miles away. And they didn't just up and leave. Instead, as instructed by the farm owners, the farm hands quickly ran back to their homes, donned their AK-47's, and returned to their respective farms where they worked to patrol the fields. One of the families I worked with had their staff patrol the watermelon fields, as watermelons are easier to steal than some other crops like beans. 
In the end, that night was otherwise uneventful; the thieves never came through our community. But the community members were ready and willing to defend themselves and their livelihoods.
Ultimately we are all responsible to secure our own individual livelihoods. This is the promise and the opportunity that bitcoin presents us with. The question is: Will you be ready to defend yourself when the sirens sound? Or, on the other hand, are you content to leave your property unprotected or in the hands of some incompetent tenant who might himself abscond with your assets?

The 7 network effects of Bitcoin are:
1. Speculation — Speculators are attracted to this new asset class by its novelty and high volatility.
2. Merchant Adoption — Merchants are attracted by the profit margin increases which Bitcoin enables, namely: avoiding credit card fees and eliminating chargebacks.
3. Consumer Adoption — Consumers are attracted by discounts (a la [Purse]( for saving on Amazon), increased transaction privacy, and greater economic sovreignty: e.g., the ability to buy restricted or otherwise unavailable goods.
4. Security — Insofar as the system is secured by miners and decentralized by nodes the network can be considered trustworthy. Likewise, as more speculators, merchants, and consumers come on board, the price increases and miners are incentivized to participate, further securing the network.
5. Developer Mindshare - Developers are attracted to Bitcoin because there is money in it, and because its open protocol and codebase enable permissionless innovation.
6. Financialization - Fintech firms and venture capitalists are investing in the Bitcoin ecosystem not only to facilitate main street investor speculation, but also because its programmable nature allows for the transfer and registry of assets of all types: titles, stocks, securities, etc.
7. Adoption as a World Reserve Currency - While the previous network effects build upon each other and help to raise its market capitalization, developers continue to enhance Bitcoin's scalability and utility. Eventually all transactions may be settled on the blockchain. Adoption as a World Reserve Currency may happen through the gradual recognition of Bitcoin as a technically superior form of money. More likely, however, is uptake resulting from: A) continued crises in other fiat currencies, or B) so called "[speculative attacks]( against weaker currencies, leading in either case to [Hyperbitcoinization](

I guess my point is the government/the IRS will do whatever the fuck it wants and you can't do shit about it. Wait. Except you can opt out. You don't have to use their shitcoin except for taxes. There is a viable alternative for exchanging goods. It is Bitcoin and they can't really tax it effectively. That gives it value in my mind, a kind of sovereignty.

On a more serious note: Sure, USD can be used to pay taxes. Until the government stops taking USD that is. The government can demand payment in any form it likes, I do believe.

My Rough Translation:
-- Bitcoin ATM's: Here's an ATM next to us. Where are these made?
-- Generally in America.
-- There are more and more Bitcoin ATM's around the world. We can see them on the map. There are 555.
-- 16 in Japan, huh?
-- Yes, there are different brands too: Genesis ATM is the leading manufacturer of Bitcoin ATM's. Lamassu is  One's that are easy to use are becoming more common. We are adding one Bitcoin ATM per day on average right now around the world.
-- Recently the price has been going up and down. But it seems more people are buying bitcoin these days; we can safely ignore the recent Hearn debacle.
-- There was a seminar recently that we attended. How was it for you?
-- I thought that it was easy to understand, and I thought it was noteworthy that transactions are almost free of fees
and the fact that everyone in the network secures bitcoin together I thought was interesting. I also thought, wow, I've never thought about the nature of money before either...
-- A lot of people were buying bitcoins there, too, huh?
-- Yeah, quite a few people.
-- Some individuals were buying a large amount too.
-- So let's talk about how people are getting their hands on bitcoin these days... If you buy bitcoin at an ATM you'll either send it to a wallet on your phone, or you'll get one of these paper wallets with the private key and the public key showing. Of course if you've got a lot of money on your paper wallet, it's insecure, and you stand to lose it all if anyone scans the private key before you transfer the bitcoin associated with it away to some other wallet (and a new address).
-- So how do you secure bitcoin? If you look at the top 100 richest bitcoin addresses on BitcoinRichList, it shows there are some with over $60 million worth of bitcoin in them. And notice the addresses here, there are a few that start with a 3, and most of the rest start with a number 1. The number at the beginning of the addresses tell you something. A 1 tells you that it's a normal single-signature wallet address. A 3 tells you that it belongs to a multi-signature wallet.
-- Multi-signature wallets, such as the Trezor hardware wallet, or any number of multi-sig software wallets, allow you to divide the ownership or control over a bitcoin wallet amongst three or more keys. You can distribute these keys around the world, or have your neighbor or a friend hold a 3rd key for you while you hold 2. If you hold 2 keys, you can use those 2 keys to spend your bitcoin from the multi-sig wallet that you've got. If you lose one, your neighbor can still help you sign off on the transaction so it can be sent.
-- It's kind of like a bank, isn't it?
-- It is like a bank except only the wallet (account) owner can move the bitcoin to a new address.
-- Only about 30 out of the top 100 bitcoin addresses now is a multi-sig wallet address. It seems rather foolish. You're much more vulnerable keeping all your bitcoin in a single-signature wallet. I think we'll be seeing the number of multi-sig addresses increase a lot in the near future. We could expect more multi-sig addresses to be taking up the top 100 richest address spots in the next few years.
-- There are some trends in top companies around the world (having to do with dematerializaiton). So many of the world's most innovative companies have little-to-no property or inventory; they generally just coordinate others' resources:
* Uber - The world's largest taxi company owns no vehicles.
* Facebook - The world's most popular media owner creates no content.
* Alibaba - The most valuable retailer has no inventory.
* Airbnb - The world's largest accommodation provider owns no real estate.
-- I could see bitcoin fitting into such a role the future: "Bitcoin - The world's largest bank holds no money".
-- The Trezor is a really cool way to protect your bitcoins. If you don't plug it into your computer, you can't spend the bitcoins. If your computer is hacked, you're protected because the private key for your wallet is on the other device, the Trezor. Not only is the key separated from the network (offline), but you need to enter an pincode with on-screen obfuscated number pad, but also you need to confirm two times by pressing a button on the device before you can send money to someone.
-- And now Trezor is selling this multi-sig set of hardware wallets. There's three in each package. You could take two and trust me to hold the third as a backup. You'd need both of your keys, or one of yours plus mine, in order to withdraw from the account. I can't ever withdraw from the account because I only have one key.
-- You can see this being potentially very useful for companies to secure large accounts. For example, they could distribute 15 keys to members of the board of directors. Maybe they give one to a law firm they hire to arbitrate in the case consensus cannot be reached or if, heaven forbid, more than half of the board members die or lose their keys. You can set the minimum number of keys needed to send a transaction to whatever you want: 5 of 15, 10 of 15, etc.
-- There are new physical hardware wallets that work just like credit cards, too, now. They use the same kind of chip technology and everything. As of right now, there is no standard way of securing your bitcoin with hardware wallets. The bitcoin ecosystem is still in its infancy, but it is developing quickly.
-- What do you think about all this?
-- I feel like I want to know more now, like it would be good to know about bitcoin and how it works.
-- What about the economic and technological impacts that this technology can have? What do you think about this?
-- It seems like it could be useful for many things. Since you can send money to anyone it would be great for charity, wouldn't it?
-- Yes, indeed. You can donate to any given cause around the world.
-- Ultimately, it's really a young technology and is not very user-friendly yet. But the developers in the space are working at a frantic pace to build it out and make it better and easier to use.

Core is upgrading a lot of other things, adding extensibility into bitcoin as it does so. Think: RAM, network card, CPU, security software, upgraded ports, etc. The hard drive can and may be upgraded later, if necessary. Consider how SegWit improves "data storage" (e.g. compression) on the existing hard drive without the need to shut the system down, and that lightning network effectively promises both plug-and-play RAM and Flash memory functionality. 
Which computer would you rather own? Personally, I want the one with faster CPU's, more RAM, and a standard hard drive of say 500GB, but with unlimited ethernet and USB ports.

Demanding an answer in the next 3 weeks. Can there be no polite request? Can there be no recognition of the hard work that devs have done and are currently doing? 


This, on the other hand, seems an entirely rational and reasonable position to take. I'm pleased to hear it. 
The tone of these two remarks feels quite different. One is a demand (wherein similarly phrased recent statements by other interest groups inherently contained a threat); the other is an assurance that there will be no rushed hard-fork. 
I feel more recognition is due to the community of developers and other stake-holders who have worked so hard in recent months to arrive at a concensus (i.e. scaling conferences; road map; improved communication), regardless of how incomplete this consesus is perceived to be by such petitioners.

It doesn't really matter if people think Bitcoin is part of some new world order. That may be true, or people may believe it, but the key point about Bitcoin as a kind of stalwart against taxes is simply that if enough people use it and enough people stop using fiat money and stop paying taxes (even by degrees) the government will not be able to sustain itself and continue on its track of perpetual growth and expansion. 
Basically, the assertion is that wide-spread deflationary currency use will lead to an enriched populous (who saves instead of spends their cash like it's sand falling through their fingers) and an impoverished government that is less and less able to siphon value off from its citizens through inflation and taxation.

7 doublings. Right. Not years. (Largely meant as a joke to play off your solar analogy.)
In any case, you've failed to name or elucidate any particular network effects bitcoin may be "missing" if the block size were to remain at 1MB. Consider also how bitcoin scalability may be enhanced and remain more-or-less unencumbered despite keeping the 1MB block size limit in perpetuity. (Notice I said *may* and that this is a hypothetical question, not necessarily what I view to be the most likely outcome.)

Perhaps we should first let bitcoin grow to 1% of the world's total combined currency market cap. Then we could take off its training wheels and let it scale. After all, it would be just be 7 years away from reaching the fullness of its potential at that point, right?
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:41:16
While I disagree on some points, I like your dispassionate style of argumentation. The world (esp. r/bitcoin) needs more of this. 


I think enough companies are either OK with current proposals (and uncertainty about the future) in terms of capacity planning, or will be able to adjust on the fly going forward, that spending Q1 to implement -- or wait for SW, etc., to be implemented -- will not adversely impact the ecosystem or the market cap. 


Again, not every company needs to survive in order for Bitcoin to thrive. 


I think ETH is interesting and promising for those applications you mentioned. I disagree with your prioritization of these applications for Bitcoin, however. On its merits as a currency, commodity, and settlement network alone I feel bitcoin can stand, maybe even indefinitely. The main use-cases for Bitcoin are its utility as a store of value and as a medium of exchange. It will perhaps remain dominant as a cryptocurrency by virtue (solely) of staying true to these two functions as opposed to fracturing or trying to differentiate into the EverythingCoin that some adherents want it to become despite it still being in its infancy. 


As stated previously, I think utility has  pluralistic definitions: maybe IoT + smart contacts + futures markets for ETH; uncensorable, increasingly-fungible, P2P currency for BTC.


Again, merely as a *currency* rails of trust I believe bitcoin could succeed. Until and unless ETH begins to compete as a currency with bitcoin I think its market cap will remain low proportionately. 
Personally, I think if ETH were to reach say half of BTC market cap I might perhaps hedge 5-10% of my bitcoin in it. Until then its usefulness as a currency and investment is quite limited to me. (I nevertheless remain open to new arguments and evidence to the contrary.)

Customers such as myself are interested in paying you for your products and services using Bitcoin. Have you considered accepting it? Setup is straightforward and there are some major benefits for you as a merchant: If you use a payment processor like Bitpay, they take at most a 0.5% fee for transactions and you can receive equal-value USD settlements in your bank account *the very next day*. If you choose, you can also keep a percentage of the bitcoins you receive instead of converting them to cash. Finally, there are no charge-backs. It's simply not possible with Bitcoin.
It may also interest you to know that many customers who pay with Bitcoin spend 10% to 50% more than their counterparts who pay with cash/credit, depending on the industry. See BitPay's recent blog post for more on the trends in Bitcoin payment processing and transaction volume here: [

First of all, have you ever considered that perhaps it's not government that is ultimately best suited to build hospitals and roads? I mean who does the government contract out to but groups of capable individuals with the required skill sets? 
Now back to brunt of your question/critique. If everyone starts to use bitcoin instead of US dollars, I would expect the following to happen:
1. The majority of the population should grow increasingly wealthy over time due to bitcoin's deflationary nature,
2. Much of the economy will go underground/international, decreasing tax revenue from sales and income tax, 
3. The now more wealthy populous will become less reliant on state services, while at the same time those services and social programs will be receiving  less funding via taxation,
4. The more transparent and "accountable" governmental institutions which rely on tax revenue will necessarily shrink,
5. As folks exit the dollar and other fiat currencies, and progressively store more of their wealth in bitcoin or other deflationary commodities, the relative value if those fiat currencies will drop (consider fiatleak.com),
6. This would likely force the Fed and Central Banks to increase interest rates or print more money (QE), or both, as they try to prop up their collapsing currencies. (I expect a lot more QE is most likely, personally.)
7. With this we may see the end of the dominion of fractional reserve banking and fiat currencies, with governments forced to dial back their deficit spending, buy stable assets themselves (such as bitcoin, in theory), and consequently enact Actually Sane Fiscal Policies and start anew with reasonable, minimal budgets.
8. Ultimately, this entails the preponderance of stable deflationary currencies and the weakening or complete obviation of fiat money, meaning as much as the Fed and Central Banks print money, it won't be worth enough -- even in the Quadrillions -- to fund wars of aggression around the world. 
This is how Bitcoin ends war. 
The key is for Bitcoin as a software ecosystem and network to remain robust, and I think eventually, inevitably, this fiat leak phenomenon will take hold as more and more people realize that their wealth is being siphoned out from under them in our current monetary regime.
@_date: 2015-11-20 23:55:33


Of course there is no basis for this. Nothing like Bitcoin has ever existed in the history of the world. Perhaps it can be considered a form of Value-Transfer Singularity, a sudden, irreversible shift into a new era, one in which we can't predict how drastically things will change going forward. Bitcoin may turn out to be as or even more impactful than the internet in the realms of technology and politics. It may permanently alter the ways in which we interact and do business. The truth is, as I said, that we can't know how great Bitcoin's effect on the world will be.


I said nothing of Bitcoin changing human nature. Do you think it will change human nature? I, personally, think it's a monetary and asset transfer system with some enticing features. People may be incentivized to use it as per the trends I described in my previous comment: basically, people fleeing (theoretically) hyper-inflating fiat currencies and buying up bitcoin to preserve their wealth. Governments may even choose to do this if their experiments with 0-and-negative interest rates and quantitative easing fail; some more in-tune politicians and central bankers might notice the growing fiat leak and suggest buying up more stable assets such as the aforementioned bitcoin.
The point is not that people would demand and then hope to get the government to enact sane policies; there's a preponderance of evidence that points to this not working. So I suppose I agree with you that, say 'bitcoiners demanding sane policies' is unlikely to change anything. You're missing my point entirely. The idea is that the (hypothetical) shift to deflationary currencies on a global scale would force the government's hand, force the Fed's hand, and that with their money burning up through hyperinflation, and with people exiting the dollar in droves, their printing of cash would no longer allow them to fund massive militaries. Concomitantly, a perhaps-not-insignificant percentage of consumers and businesses transacting in Bitcoin may choose not to pay income and sales tax, seeing how the government is impoverishing us all through its myopic and parasitic monetary policies, and bending over backwards to please big business.


The question is not how would you 'make' people use Bitcoin or 'make' the government accountable. Instead, it is a question of how much people will be drawn to Bitcoin naturally out of their own self-interest, and, at the same time, how much government and Central Banks will continue to inflate a bubble and shoot themselves in the foot, for once possibly disempowering and obviating their own programs and institutions instead of pulling a fast one on us little guys -- we may have already moved on to a system that will enrich our lives instead of one in which our wealth is constantly slipping through our fingers.
Just you wait, if bitcoin goes to $1,000 or $10,000 and stays there, or just slowly continues to creep up in value -- it's volatility decreasing steadily all the while -- I expect interest will scale proportionately. In theory, consumer adoptions leads to merchant adoptions, which leads to an increased market cap, which encourages miners to hold on to bitcoin, further driving the price up and securing the network. On top of this developers will build out the software ecosystem and continue to increase the system's robustness and utility, inventing new and previously unimaginable ways to leverage blockchain technology -- because there are users out there who want to use it; they just don't know it yet. ;-)
And on the note of government accountability... the Bitcoin protocol itself could have some role to play, don't you think? Fraud-proof elections, anyone? Decentralized document registries? So much could come out of this and with each successive iteration it empowers the people and obviates centralized systems and governments. As an aside, I might suggest exploring the potential of smart contracts if you haven't.


People like money. That's an incentive. People can build hospitals and roads. They already do in fact. Private roads have and do work; same with hospitals. People are also quite charitable and care for their fellow man. With a reduced tax and regulatory burden, we can care for each other even better. I believe in people and I believe we can watch out for each other. We don't need the man; we've been bred into captivity.


Never underestimate the corrupting influence of a machine that can print you an infinite supply of money. The government borrows money from the Fed in order to spend tax dollars it doesn't have. Not everything is paid for with tax revenues. Fractional reserve banking has greatly facilitated the building up of the military-industrial complexes of the world.


Again, I never claimed Bitcoin would change human nature. Although we may have known about the Banksters' parasitism for ages, we have never had such a potent liberating technology and commodity as Bitcoin. If it were the same as gold we certainly wouldn't be making such a fuss over it now, now would we? Can you carry gold across borders with impunity and write smart contracts with it? Perhaps, eventually, people will come around to the benefits of bitcoin (over those of gold and also fiat money). For some it will take longer, and of course some may never embrace it. But we live in a new era, with new options. I for one find that quite exciting! : )
