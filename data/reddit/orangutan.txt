It's called high technology theft and we all fell victim to it.

Damn.  I guess the next question would be if it was just lost to the ether, or was actually stolen?  Did the value just disappear or did it get pilfered by another entity?

Fuck.  That's heartbreaking.

Did the people who were involved with Mt. Gox lose any of their money?  Were customers screwed?

Well according to the headline of this post and the Mt. Dox story, yes.  Humans have corrupted the supposedly incorruptible bitcoin enterprise.

I thought a bunch of people got screwed over by Mt. Dox exchange or something.  Maybe I misread it.

Now you guys want regulation?  What happened to your faith in Hakushi Nakamoto or whatever his name was?

Well I heard that only technology was behind bitcoin so unscrupulous people couldn't infiltrate it or whatever.

I'd say if anything the whole bitcoin thing needs more transparency not less.  When this started everyone was saying how it was criminal proof and transparent and couldn't be corrupted by humans.  That all turned out to be completely false, so lets shine some light on this mysterious cashless currency and see how that goes for awhile.

I thought bitcoin was supposed to be human fault proof

What happened?

I just gave my 6 votes thanks to this post.  Hopefully Bitcoin pans out and thanks for the notification.  Peace.

I'm not sure how to upload the image to that folder in the site.  That's why I used Imgur.  Trying to figure it out now.  Thanks!
