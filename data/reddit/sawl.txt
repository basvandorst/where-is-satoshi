A correction up or down?

You are wise.

I see incredibly little evidence of that ever happening. In general it costs around 5k to mine a bitcoin in most places.  If it ever gets to around 6k then the resistance from miners will be very significant.

7.3k was the bottom.

How is it unprecedented? Were you not here last month when it dropped to 6500???

IMO, if bitcoin was converted to be displayed as milli satoshis (or something like that), I think people would buy into it a lot more.  The average person won't want to jump in and buy 1 bitcoin, and at the same time it feels weird to own .3435359 bitcoin.

How you feel now? Hope you're ready for your lambo.

So many things can happen that can completely destroy a logarithmic trend. For all we know G20 could completely screw us this week and that math would mean absolutely nothing.

Have you even looked at a trade volume chart lmao?
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:43:43
It does this literally all the time. Are you new here?

There's no one reason you can pin it on.  If you want a simple and short answer it's "human emotions."

It has literally been 11k today. WTF are you talking about.

It's not close to a conspiracy at all...you can literally use bots to track the large orders and it's incredibly obvious. It's much easier to make money long term when the price stays low.

TO THE MOON!!

I'm very aware that they know that, but I very seriously believe it feels psychologically better when you can buy 10000 satoshis rather than .1 bitcoin(conversion not correct). 
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:35:02
You should double check your facts on that. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:08:54
You should not base incredibly serious financial investments based on this rationale.  If that's the only argument you can make then you are not mature enough to handle this market.

On the gemini chart it showed approximately 6500 when the crash was occurring.  On this one ( it shows 7380.  I never saw any exchanges as low as 6000.  It's not worth arguing over. My main point is that dropping this low is by no means "unprecedented."

It's still going up. I would not call this a bull trap. Don't worry too much about this dip, we haven't had one in a while (in bitcoin time) and this isn't dire.
