Fortunately, attacking the network requires more than just money: it requires an extraordinarily large amount of a supremely limited resource (asic miners). 
If someone put in an order for enough hashing power to control the bitcoin network, we would know about it long before it was up and running. 
Its similar to watching countries try and develop nuclear weaponry.

cryptocurrency is the only form of money that can do what i described. thats the definition of intrinsic value.
if you can't understand this then i dont have time to explain it. just buy and hold for 5 years.

Ah yes now I follow. That would be an interesting situation indeed. Quite messy as well. I think that an elegant solution would need to be found before the fork happened. A way to change the identity of all forked coins.
But it does seem like a lot of potential attacks on bitcoin have and will come from setting up nodes which broadcast mailcious transactions. I will have to learn more about this.

Thanks for the clarification.
You know, setting up microscale bitcoin implementations in order to test theoretical attacks and corner scenarios is something that I have been mulling over for a while.
My dev skills aren't up to par yet but maybe sometime soon I will try buying 5-6 computers and setting up low difficulty bitcoin setups in order to test things like this.
Can you expand on the 'transactions released on one chain would be valid on the other'. I don't see how this would work

If a pool decided to change the code on their own they would cause a fork on the blockchain. It would be like they were mining an altcoin. Their bitcoins would be worthless.

Bitcoin is NOT fiat money because it has intrinsic value. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 05:21:37
The coins that have value are determined by the community. They could have all of the power in the world, and if no one wanted to use their coins, then they would be worthless. 
Note that in the crypto world, worth is found by how many bitcoins someone is willing to trade for any new altcoin. If no one was willing to trade legacy bitcoins for this new fork bitcoin then it would be worthless.

the protocol and the ease of transaction

It would be interesting to test this out by creating a worthless alt coin where 75 percent of a hashrate could be made by letting your backup computer mine, and then turn it off to see what happens.
As far as bitcoin goes though, it will never come to that.

First of all, Doge is based on Luckycoin, which is based on Litecoin. Doge did not remove their cap on purpose.
What happened with Doge is that the developers didn't realize that their implementation which allowed for randomly awarded blocks was going to keep on giving out coins over time. There is a discussion about this on github. They smartly decided to keep it this way instead of fixing it in order to differentiate themselves from e-gold style cryptos.
As far as Bitcoin goes, the devs do have the power to uncap the max_money variable written by Satoshi. In fact you can do it yourself by forking the project. No one will accept your money though.
Will they uncap it sometime in the future? Who knows. Gavin said something pretty strange in his interview at the IMF(?) where he said "we can talk about how hard and fast those rules are later". I personally don't like that new goatee he is sporting. It makes him look evil. Money corrupts people.
If they do change it then a majority of the miners would have to accept it.

I see, how did you set up multibit on your new computer?
I believe what happened is that if the wallet.dat are related, you sent .01 to the front end adress, and then the change got routed to the same address.
Check the settings in multibit.

Your theory relies on a flawed understanding of bitcoin mining.
Rest assured that there is no better technology for sha-256 bruteforcing than what is currently being produced and used for Bitcoin mining. Even if the NSA had some sort of inside information on the function, they would have to put their hashing power up against the network just like everyone else, because there is randomness involved by way of the nonce.
Next, even if such a system existed, pumping up the difficulty to a super high value and then backing out wouldn't matter.
1. Because the network difficulty is already growing exponentially. 
2. Because even if they pushed the difficulty to inifinity, it would readjust shortly. 
Well maybe not infinity, but 2^256

equal distribution of wealth is literally the worst possible scenario for any store of value. because it would then be worthless.

It looks like whatever wallet your old computer was using implements change in a strange way. Either that or you swept the wallet.
You didn't create bitcoins out of thin air by the way. Everything adds up fine. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 05:12:11
What program were you using to send the coins?
Change just means that if you spend 3 coins in a wallet with 5 coins, the remaining 2 will get sent to a new address instead of staying in place. It's a quirk in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-20 05:23:14
Gotcha. Glad it all worked out. yeah I figured it had something to do with change.. that's the one part of bitcoin that really goes against common sense.
