The point is that transaction fees will be so prohibitively expensive on the blockchain with 1mb that only the largest LN hubs will be able to utilize it. Thus, to spend your BTC, or send them to anyone else, you’ll be forced to go through a LN hub and pay a fee to the owner of said hub. This is precisely what Core means when they use the term “settlement layer”. This is why anyone who argues increasing the blocksize increases centralization, but restricting it does not, has no idea what they’re talking about, or completely ignores this simple fact.

So you want BTC to rise in value but to never be used as currency? Do you realize that if no one is willing to accept BTC as payment in exchange for fiat or goods, then you will never be able to sell it? Sounds a lot like tulips to me.

It’s unethical because BSCore deserves all hash power, and any diverging opinions are an attack on the network by Jihan and Ver. /s

You're correct. *Bitcoin Cash* is Bitcoin. Perhaps you're confused on naming convention?

If a majority of miners diverted hashpower to a different chain, and allowed it to accumulate the **greatest proof-of-work effort**, then, **by definition in the Bitcoin whitepaper** (which I literally quoted in my earlier reply), it *is* Bitcoin.
You're conflating diversion of hashpower with *greatest proof-of-work effort*. The former can happen suddenly and unexpectedly (Bitcoin Cash sometimes gains majority hashpower), the latter cannot without majority consensus.

1mBTC = 0.001 BTC ~= $6 (at current prices) is not exactly a micropayment. Also, I tried to cashout this payment, yet I can only receive 0.5mBTC because the fee (on this tip bot's site) is 0.5mBTC ~= $3.
So I was tipped $6, but I can literally only cashout $3 because of fees. Thanks for proving my point.
Try sending $0.25 and let's see how much of that I can cashout. My account would probably be negative.

Ironic. The sheep mentality of “only follow Core” is exactly why Core’s chain is not decentralized and leads to these splits in the first place.
Let me ask: What legitimate reason do you have to oppose 2mb blocks besides the fact that Core opposes it?

No. Just look at the Bitcoin transaction backlog. The 1mb block restriction is making transactions very expensive. Micro-payments are no longer a thing for BTC. Bitcoin Cash has a tip bot and micro-payments, though.

Are you expecting me to rehash the scaling debate for you? Satoshi *expected* a blocksize increase to be the natural progression for scaling when he added the 1mb limit as a spam filter. Go read the old forum posts where he explicitly states, “It can be phased in...”.
