Crazy all the lightning nodes are popping up so fast. Will this accelerate the timeline for LN to be ready for the public?
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:44:07
His name is Harodl.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:19:31
Yeaaaaa, if it goes on coinbase like people think that's gonna be one amazing feeling punch.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:08:15
I think it'll be worth a million if bitcoin sticks around for another 20 years. Gotta wait on LN to make bitcoin practical and then we'll see.
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:31:34
It's not, but it will be.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:56:50
HIS NAME IS HARODL
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:47:40
Guess I'll be a criminal then
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:00:00
Is there any benefit to testing this repeatedly? I'll keep buying blockacinos all day if it helps
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:40:24
It'll come back at the latest when LN gets released. Might be tepid until then but mark my words the value will return in a big way.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:57:05
Fuck no. If I lost a million bucks for a month I'd bitch too.

Bitcoin Judas!!
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:14:20
I feel like you may be willfully ignorant here. It would be wonderful FOR US if it continues up, but that would mean there are no other forces at play aside from optimism and require everyone to be in agreement about it’s value. In the real world people want to see it fail just about as often as people want. To see it succeed. There are both upward and downward pressures on bitcoin’s value. It could never just grow unchecked.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:13:03
What fork is this? I'm trying to decide if it's worth it to move my bitcoin off exchange for this, knowing I'll have to send it all back
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:04:22
I'm sure someone got a Korean friend and they're making a mint
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:16:21
Where's Harodl?
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:27:07
They're only ahead because they're not carrying the same level of volume
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:04:22
It shows us what the market can actually withstand. The run up to 20 was hysteria and speculation, held by lots and lots of weak hands. When the price falls, and they sell out (at a loss) we find out where the actual resistance level is - or where people en masse decide that it's silly for the price to be that low and buy in. If this correction didn't happen for long enough, it really would crater at the first huge dump. Imagine bitcoin going from 100k to 10k as people abandon ship. It would probably kill it all the way to zero!
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:00:14
Lightning network comin'

You won't get one single answer. Just understand that the shock of suddenly being rich won't be like in the movies. If you like things the way they are now, alter your situation as little as possible with smaller pleasures and deniability. You can make your wife happy without completely shattering your world.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:40:41
That's horrible.

Satoshi's code was much sloppier than Hal's. Doubtful they're the same
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:39:19
No, it has to drop in order to test it
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:23:05
Careful what you wish for. If it drops to  10k I'll be sick
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:45:00
It'll go through eventually. But who knows when. Could be months. I had one hanging for 3 weeks at 15 sat. 
Just gonna have to wait for the mempool to clear. Maybe by the time we get LN
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:02:26
So.. no?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:53:23
Like a child. Sad.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:25:47
I will be

I want to move my coin off exchange and into a segwit address. Now with all these forks coming up seems like the right time to do it. What's the best segwit wallet out there, and is there an easy to follow tutorial?
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:48:47
Assuming lightning is working well for at least 6 months.. 120k
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:07:15
Well it's not, NOT coming.

Corporate banker and investment money is flooding in, plus media fueled frenzy. Don't you think that would account for one doubling, if not 2?
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:16:24
We all are
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:13:19
SUPER low. I'm using a major bank, and my account limits are basement with no understandable reason why. And no customer service to give me an answer. I'm out.
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:37:38
I'm basically working to get bitcoin these days. I WILL have a whole bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-05 00:15:08
That is one wealty dude right about now.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:27:57
Right now when I want to buy large amounts, I have to go through the simplex attachment to my Mycelium wallet, but I end up paying +10% on those transactions. Criminal.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:48:37
No, you're being wilfully ignorant. The point of Bitcoin is to act as a the internet of money for all. It's very awesome that large transfers can be made rapidly, but the small ones are just as important for the day to day.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:17:12
I'm confused. Doesn't the lack of replay protection mean that 2x and 1x versions will spend the same coin?
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:01:02
You're simply wrong dude. Bitcoin is not meant to act only in that capacity.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:18:27
Yes! I didn't give all my bank account info though, since I prefer just to use my debit card
@_date: 2017-01-05 04:08:40
When I buy, it goes down. When I sell, it goes up. I am the harbinger. Heed my poor calls.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:44:30
It costs about 6k to mine a bitcoin. The price will probably be propped up for support around there by miners

IT DIDN'T WORK FOR BERNIE
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:49:20
$2 fee on a $800 purchase isn't bad. And faster? I really don't think so.
Cup of coffee argument is being solved by lightning network
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:12:10
My brother lives in Japan and doesn't know shit about bitcoin. I'm not certain adoption is as widespread there as we think
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:06:31
I did panic.
WHILE BUYING UP ALL DAT CHEAP COIN
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:41:29
You're wrong. It just can't act as a transactional currency because of tx fees. Lightning network comin'..
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:03:27
Yeah, I'm gonna try to stop bringing it up on dates..
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:41:31
It's possible, we're definitely gonna see some shit when the financial institutions make their offerings on the 10th. I sound like a broken record, but that and LN are both gonna be moon shots
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:47:57
You don't get to talk for the entire bitcoin community, dude. Talk about orthodoxy when referring to something that's supposed to be brand new and world changing? Something that's purpose is to challenge the current world orthodoxy? Go read the cypherpunk manifesto linked on the side bar. Bitcoin will be used for currency, store of value, and much more to come.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:32:13
His prediction is conservative. Will be at 15,000 by mid 2018.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:03:27
Just bought on this advice. Let's see what happens.
I could buy a little more, but I just don't have the stomach
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:05:07
Gemini, baby. They'll give you $500 "credit" if you have it in your account.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:42:14
No, you're repeating the views of SOME of the mods and SOME of the core contributors. There is no consensus on what you're saying.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:13:36
No choice now, baby! To the moon!!
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:02:55
How do you do that?
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:00:45
I disagree completely
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:43:06
That's hilarious
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:35:35
Futures are about to come out on the 10th. How could they be right?
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:40:30
BUY THAT DIP
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:05:07
Blocksize increase isn't legitimately scalable. IF people started actually using bitcoin cash en masse (they won't, but let's just say if) then once we push the limit of 8mb blocks, we'll have to fork again to 80. then again to 800. Then again to even more. Then again and again and again until the blocks are too big to handle rapidly.
We need smarter solutions, like segwit and lightning network. 1MB blocks are fine, turn your BCH back into BTC and hold. You're just scaring yourself.
Edit: I'm not against bigger blocks, just saying that increasing blocksize alone won't help. I kind of like the idea of 2MB blocks, but it's no kind of long term solution and never will be.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:41:40
Hodling, but damn. This is my first attack, and I wish it would just stop
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:45:20
Not at all. I'm saying it is a transactional currency, it will be a better one soon, and that Bitcoin was always meant to be a transactional currency. Store of value just happens to be an awesome, current bonus.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:33:44
Yeah, it's crazy to think about how the thing that's supposed to save bitcoin by making it scalable isn't necessary now that interest has started to wane. Wish we had LN in December.. :-/
To the moooooon.... sigh
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:59:11
LN is unfortunately, not almost here.
