Would have made 4% from the deal, that's right. But the main reason was, I needed to cash out fast.

Many red flags looking back to it, didn't list all of them. These people do this for living, but I was not used to take every person as a potential scammer, haven't got scammed before. Learned my lesson for sure.

First, the youngster came to the meeting point, the uncles followed a minute after - my guess: they were on the look, if a person coming to the meeting has met them before.
Second, they didn’t agree the meeting point we suggested - a public bar across the road. We thought the hotel lobby doesn't sound that bad and agreed.
Third, they wanted to keep it quiet. Even though the youngster 'had a business'. Maybe the idea was to make it look like the business is just a cover-up for some illegal stuff, but we just went with it, we didn't care.
Most of it was just psychological bullshit, which was difficult to label as a big no-no, since the behaviour could be common to anyone. I guess I was just hypnotised, my mind totally excluded the possibility of getting scammed. Needed to get it done fast and already spent the money in my mind.

The changed only a few words in French, should have clarified that. Could have been done just for distraction.

That's what I thought would have happened if I'd caught them switching.. Both of them were twice my size.
