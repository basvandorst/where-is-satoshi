I mentioned the many other currencies out there. This computation is just meant to set up a way to build some intuition about it. If the US was to release a digital currency tomorrow, destroy all cash, and have 21M coins the price would be around 47k. And people are calling for 10k soon for a coin traded worldwide with no signing adoption. Does this seem priced correctly to you?

I want rich parents, will you adopt me?

What trust? Bitcoin has dropped 7%, litecoin 12%, in the last hour.  They are *not* worth the same in the near future. No rational person would use a currency that fluctuates that rapidly. Until prices are stable, it's a speculation instrument, despite the fact a few people buy a pizza with BTC. 
edit: to be clear, this argument doesn't rest on a 'drop'. It could have risen that much. Either way, I want 2 bitcoin for my used car, and you want my car. Would you pay 2BTC when those coins will be worth 10% more in an hour if there is a rise. Will I take it or change my price if there is a drop?
No thanks, I'll take cash, where I have a reasonable expectation of stable value, or peg the bitcoin price of the car to current market value of BTC/USD, which is roughly the same thing as taking cash.

There is ~1.2T usd  in circulation, and 21M bitcoin available (max). That's ~47k USD/BTC. 
Is the current trading value rational, given that USD is still in circulation, along with a hundred other currencies? I leave that for you to answer.
And then, "we have no way to rationally price BTC", which is my summary of your message.  Well, does the combination of we have no way to assign a price and yet it is 7x higher than the beginning of the year  sound like a bubble? 
Schiller comes from a position of - we need a way to rationally price an asset, or any big leap in price is almost certainly a bubble.
It has happened over and over tulips, houses, tech companies with no way to produce income, etc. People buy only because they think they can get someone else to buy from them for a higher price. Sure, you can hope it will become a dominant currency, but that is just speculation.
That's not a prediction of a 'pop', btw. It could hold, slowly replace existing currency, and then drift to a rational value. 
But ya, a price jump without underlying fundamentals? That's a bubble.
