Dirk Willer from Citi is behind that "research" paper. 
Here's a reuters interview with the author - Dirk is pushing for Chilean peso investments.
Against Dirk's better judgment, the peso was about to start a 60% decline following this very interview.

Sure AMT is real, but even if NSA forced intel and AMD to backdoor it, how are they gonna access port 16992/16993 from a hibernated computer that in 99.99% of the cases will be safe and sound behind any decent router/firewall?
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:42:48
Nobody is really using AMT, and most of the modern motherboards &amp; operating systems have it disabled by default. 
There are many routers and even more firmware's, many seem to think that NSA has tons of super geniuses coding l33t backdoor hacks for 10000 different firmware's, this is not the case, most NSA people you will ever come across are what silicon valley headhunters would consider at most secondary, but usually 3rd picks ( fresh out from school, your average guy with your average IQ ).

The world would dump interest rates to negative territory, open any "liquidity window" and funnel freshly printed trillions to their bankster buddys.
People with less financial know-how assume this environment might hurt bitcoin's dollar value ( bitcoin was created as a reaction to a financial crisis )

Two things we realized from this dip. 1) Wall street played a major role in both pushing the price upto 19k and down to 11k and 2) Wall street has a history of not biting the hand that feed them ( the fiat system ).

Nobody is watching anything from a secondary cpu, and no one is turning on your webcam from hibernation mode, get a watt meter and monitor it yourself.
If anyone creates a backdoor like that, information about it will leak, and eventually a hacker would gain access and start mining crypto on that super secret cpu nobody knows about ( don't even get me started on how ALL worldwide motherboard manufacturers would have to be designed to support that secret CPU too ) and for what? INSTANTLY killing all future intel sales!

We are at a financial crossroad in history
One road will increase financial surveillance. Banks will eventually fail and use bail-ins to steal their customers assets, capitalism will be blamed for the failure. Apple pay will replace the dead banks, but will now be forced to report all activity to potentially corrupt authorities that will use the information to restrict any real political opponents.
The other road is decentralized, offer a safety net against corrupt politicians, and gives humanity a chance to secure a honest democratic future.
This is way bigger then lambos.

Yes, but it would have to be 100% buy and hold. 
It takes a very small % of the available bitcoins to move the market up or down 10%. Even if 95% of all bitcoins where buy and hodl, the 5% available to lend/leverage/long/short would be plenty enough to bart around the market thanks to futures &amp; bitmex type of exchanges.
And remember... The people that want bitcoin to crash in value, dont have to make ANY money from bitcoin, they dont actually have to trade with profits.
@_date: 2019-03-11 09:13:51
Lets say you and me have the ability to create money from nothing, we are both in the business of banking and feel threatened by bitcoin. One month I can issue 1 trillion of paper fiat cash settled bitcoin contracts to the market, this will shock the market and push the price down. Using computers that have monitored the market of paper contracts for years on end I know exactly how much paper contracts I need to sell to move the market one way or another, I also know at what point my large sell orders will cascade the market in a temporary downward trend, once you push the market long enough in one direction the herd ( TA "warriors" sitting at home looking at computer screens in their underwear ( often dreaming of a new sportscar ), bots ) will simply follow.
Its not that the banks need to make money to kill a product that can threaten their business, if they don't make any money at all, they would still do it. So people in the business collude with financial partners, you have one or more big player issue large sells one month ( or whatever timeframe you agree on with your partner in crime ) and your  other playmates are buying at the bottom. Rinse repeat, a products that moves like Bart Simpson in price will automatically loose value in it self. So you simply Bart the price until it becomes non threatening.
To stop this is extremely difficult, but one way to make it less profitable for the manipulators is to NOT touch futures or bitmex or any other paper contract settled bitcoin desk ( you will be on the wrong side unless you know the Bart pattern ahead of time, when you are on the wrong side you give the manipulators more fuel to help hurt the confidence in bitcoin. ).
@_date: 2019-03-09 11:33:18
Wrong. Out of all the gold in the world about 1.7% more are mined every year. Out of all the "Satoshis" in the world about 3.5% more are mined every year.
Banksters know how to suppress the price of gold using futures, and they know how to suppress the price of Bitcoin. People blinded to this fact are ironically hurting the recovery of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-11 17:18:58
I expect banks to bart around Bitcoin until people do loose interest in it, or atleast until the value is closer to what they consider a whole lot less threatening.
Are we there yet? I have no clue.
It's not easy to contain, the banksters can bart around the price even when its a 0 sum game for them. With futures/bitmex they can hedge their positions, and "steal" value from the hodlers and suppress the price at the same time, they dont have make any money, they simply can take turn in who gets to own the profitable futures.
@_date: 2019-03-12 08:36:56
That's true, but it's also important to remember = lower marketcap = less fiat cost to bart around.
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:10:32
Sure, but what about when you reach the end of the ladder? After you earned billions and a nice view?
When do you start to feel threatened?
Eventually the only thing capitalism now can guarantee is the complete loss of everything you worked so hard to get, someone younger/stronger/smarter or more handsome is right around the corner.
Old money can pretty easily be tricked into biting the hand that once fed them.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:36:15
It only becomes a loss of power when their printed fiat can't acquire crypto ( like never ), even taxes can be worked out.
Everything is recorded on the blockchain, passing a few laws will place node's of identification along the way, you won't be able to hide, and if the blockchain mark's you as shady, services can be denied.
Having the ability to store your assets away from your typical inflation based fiat's will also support moving the world to a more sustainable future, people are simply less inclined to buy and throw when they have the option to park their money and not experiencing the stress of constantly loosing purchasing power.

@_date: 2018-11-24 22:31:55
Bitcoin was never $375 in 2017 period.
Bitmex and CME paper bitcoins open up ways for manipulation of the bitcoin price... I will sum it up like this as long as bankers have the most money combined with idiots going long paper bitcoin, the price can and most likely will continue to slide.

Interesting points you raise.


The possibility to add 0's after the satoshi make's Bitcoin a inflationary / deflationary currency  ( a quite unique and exciting addition to any monetary system ).
Using a currency where the "base" constantly is increasing in value can also bring some desirable effects on a society ridden by the "buy and throw" mentality that eventually with a high enough population can threaten our planets limited resources.
I'm convinced that "programmable" expressions of value is here to stay.

Don't focus too much on this or that Government, bitcoin is a potential threat to ALL of them.

You must be aware of the fact that a majority of the "elite's" including those on my list ( against independence ) are strongly in favor of Israel and hence should be called Zionists by the very definition?
I will assume that you know too little about this world, when you start accusing the "elite" to be behind this movement, they are globalists ( they want power centralized ) and often also Zionists ( because they need the State of Israel in order to fully complete their global agenda ).
If you want me to take you seriously name some name's of those "elite" supporters of yours.

Don't miss the big picture,
Prior to any major bank run, expect draghi and yellen to use sentences such as "we stand prepared" / "we have great tools at our disposal ( enter more 0's on the keyboard )" / "we will do what's needed to preserve fiat ( while debt enslaving the people )" / "the liquidity windows are open" /  "lowered the interest rate to negative 5%"

How about you follow your own advise and "Look at what happened to the price of gold" during the latest financial crisis?
S&amp;P 500 tops out &gt;1500 October 9 2007 * Gold @ 737$ *
S&amp;P 500 bottoms out around 666 End of March 2009 * Gold @ 959$ *

That dosent mean Gold crashed during the last financial crisis, it just means the smart money moved to gold before your average investor.

Compared to the US, China has been perceived to be more of a communist country, communists have a tendency to print money ( it's expensive to finance their utopian vision and geopolitics ). Printing money usually creates inflation, inflation devalues currency.
Comparing bitcoin to fiat, doesn't always work, unforked with a 21 million cap, it's more like gold &amp; gold has outperformed the US dollar &amp; bitcoin has outperformed gold.

I admire many of Luke's contributions. I also recognize that divide and conquer, is a tactic used to destroy many financial inventions during the last 1000 years.
Bitcoin's greatest threat might be centralization, but the second greatest ( in our digital environment ) is multiple digital copy's of the same ( read forks ).

We have thrown up thousands of forks in the air, fortunes has been made, but eventually gravity takes over, and all those forks will fall back down.
Right now, the forks are landing, do we have enough hands to catch them? I see this as a major threat to crypto's, but most people here - even the once i often admire, do not fully seem to agree or even pay attention ).
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:41:10
United we stand, divided we fall. If we let bitcoin become democratized every little opinion will eventually fork a new chain, this is not helping bitcoin adoption in the broader sense.
You view this as "winning" an extra coin, when you should be viewing this as bitcoin potentially loosing whatever value that new coin gives you + more.
If bitcoin had 1 user, it would be worthless, more users backing the same currency = stronger currency.

Brilliant? Perhaps..
Yet, this dosen't sound like Satoshi's vision. Consensus is the only safeguard against the common divide and conquer / "democratizing" of systems. 
People who understand the art of war knows that this tactic successfully deployed, always leads to a corruptible environment where the few controls the many.
A house divided against itself cannot stand ( look around your society for the proofs of that )
