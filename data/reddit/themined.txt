Time to invest if it goes down, in general, the downward spiral is only a stabilization. It will boom again in 3 months, tops. 10k-15k is the new stable, and just wait when more people turn to crypto.
think of all the fiats that needs to be turned into crypto, what crypto will people prefer? BITCOIN (core)!!!!! The 10k-15k valuation today is just too small, we are going to 100k-150k valuation soon.

please buy me a MacBook, pre-install it with this magic and send it to me.

Not as awesome as lightning. Bigger blocks is so 2016

Yes, it is big. I am checking my linux node and it is 56GB now. I have my node as VM on a machine, and the "blocks" directory on a NFS share, and the bandwidth is a little bit more ridiculous.
Just last month (november) it transferred 2.9TB of data (both local; node&lt;-&gt;NFS share and non-local; node&lt;-&gt;internet)

I highly doubt that a list like that one has fishy entries, maybe if I did my own top500 list, but a list that serious? 
But I am not denying it, I just think if that is the case, then the list should not exist at all and should be hated upon by everyone.
If it comes out that this is true thou, then the legitimacy of that list will fall exponentially.

Should have read their criteria, thanks and sorry. But if so, the list is not legit. The people behind the list should be more exact with their list, instead of "randomly selecting" entries on the list to verify, and then only by "calling the site". 
A test for the computers on the list should be created to really find the best supercomputer, if not, I can't find the list to be legit. 
But anyways, I am starting to get a better view of CSW everyday since the "news" broke out.

Then start a node on a linux box (headless), it's even less satisfying too look at for "normal people". But just knowing that the node is running, is online and has the whole blockchain on its HDD is satisfying to me. I see the bandwidth it uses and I am happy. 
But as mentioned, Statoshi is nice, don't know if it is easy to setup (haven't followed the development)

Well, the computer is called "CO1N" and can be found on the "July 2015" version of the Top 500 list of super computers. CO1N is owned by "Tulip Trading", exists in Australia and belongs in the "industry" segment.
If CWS is some high-staker in "Tulip Trading" then he probably helps out in "owning" the super computer. He/They also have a plan for a supercomputer on Iceland.

removing all mining machines, all full notes, all "everything", that would be a "clamp down". How does one do that? Hmmmmmm....

Damn, that is so true. A service provide should always look for options to better their services, kudos. 
It's silly, "we" created bitcoin to "fight the power" and take control back, but nowadays it seams that we are fighting the software itself with all these lame ass discussions of "this and that" and "if, if not". 
I didn't know I would come across an open-source software that fights its community like this.

What if he thinks "fuck it" and transfers 10 bucks from SN wallet/genesis block to, lets say, Vitalik Buterin....
I would honestly rethink my existence if THAT happens...

In a sense, bitcoin is value for the world, it is not connected to a gov, country or company. If we start regulate it like "bat shit crazy" it will all go to hell, cause everyone will regulate in a different way. And having a centralized organisation (like UN) that regulates it would only be bad, cause then you have a central leader in that organisation. So fuck regulation if we want to have bitcoin like it was meant to be.

And the good guys aren't really "good guys". So, by that conclusion, please, NO BACKDOORS AT ALL!

Leave high-tech stuff to the community, and stick with your Windows shit. You fucked up Windows, and you will fuck up everything else.

Well, "word-of-mouth" is a strong PR trick. Keep at it. Sure, the prize can drop, but so can a stock when you recommend it to a friend. And the more people who knows about bitcoin, the better the world would be. go for it!
Kudos on getting them all buying a at least "some" bitcoin.
