Hah ignore me I'm thinking proportional. zagaberoo is right.

You're mining shares, not BTC. The BTC is divided to all share holders by the amount of shares they own.

The hacker likely had access to an email account or something which provided access to a bunch of services required to keep Bitconica going. Destroying these services whether they're recoverable or not is almost like a smoke screen for the 18k Bitcoins being stolen at the same time.

Your solved shares wont be sent till you reconnect and you'll eventually run out of shares to solve.

The pictures you're seeing are a list of servers running on [Rackspace]( cloud servers. Someone gained access to this account and could literally delete all of it in one fell swoop.

It was a derp moment, I set and forgot my settings all the way back in June :)

Check it's not in a low power P-State. Set custom clocks using Sapphire TriXX.

You don't need to crossfire with mining, in fact it is advised against as it performs badly. Install your card and run a second miner, you'll only need to change the device ID (0=CPU, 1,2,3 etc are GPUs).

AGGRESSION=12, nothing set for WORKSIZE. I may have had those results on Windows 7 but my mining rig is Ubuntu now.
Have another 5870 at 980/300 doing 440MH/s.

I don't actually have a 6870 so I can't test but my cards (5850s and 5870s) don't like going under 300.

Thailand Baht: ฿ and Big C is a supermarket chain in Thailand from memory.
But we can dream.

Do you have the second card plugged into a monitor? You need to extend the display in properties as well. I only ever got the BFI_INT not supported problem when I tried running miners over Remote Desktop.

Turning CF off in CCC should be enough.

5850 - 850/300: 323MH/s to 336MH/s!
5870 - 900/300: 380MH/s to 397MH/s!

More specifically you only need a dummy plug if:
* You're using Windows Vista/7, XP does not have this *problem*.
* You don't have a monitor plugged into it to activate the card, once the card is activated you can unplug it and continue mining. Just extend the display, run your miner and you can unplug it if you need to.
@_date: 2011-06-18 07:47:14
Yes, you'd have to disable CF though. The card that has the monitor plugged in will be used for gaming as default and your second card can go towards mining.

The aggression wont really drop temperatures that much, maybe a degree or two. Also you shouldn't be in CF if you are, they work better on their own. Try running your miner first and then down clocking to 350 or 400.

The extra flags, namely BFI_INT and VECTORS add a sizable amount to your Mh/s if you have a 5 series or 6 series ATi card and are **well** worth using. phatk is best used on late 5 series and 6 series cards as it gains a few Mh/s over poclbm kernel. AGRESSION is the percentage of the card to use, 12 or 13 is highest and will give best results but will make the computer unusable, 7 is best if you want to use the computer.
The main reason for the lower temps is the low memory clock at 228, it makes no performance difference to mining at all but the card runs cooler and uses less power. Ideal is 1/3 of core clock I believe but if you can get it lower power to you.

New Zealand has over 2000 books banned or censored, so it does happen.

I'm kicking myself having ordered one with a low 18X order number only to cancel as I had an order with MetaBank third party delivering earlier. Then that Metabank order was cancelled the very last minute (was packaged and ready for shipping) as they didn't have the correct legal items for customs and returned all the units back to Metabank.
So I sit here with nothing :(
