Suppose price difference is a motivation for some? And for some countries, coinbase isn't available. Some don't want to do kyc. If you immediately withdraw to your wallet some people consider that to be a low enough risk. You could ask the same to people who use the exchanges as their wallet.

The Satoshi Mansion blueprint

Are there any good estimates on how many bitcoins are lost forever? I feel these stories are almost as common as the stories of people who have bitcoins from "way back when". 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:32:30
Yes, the transactions are getting ridiculous. As I am learning I throw in a few bucks to see how it works out in practice, and it is obvious to me from this testing that the bitcoin in it's current form has broken as a functional form of payment due to it's recent rise in popularity (10$ transaction fee levels and/or hours of waiting time is hardly something which works to buy me a cup of coffee). It would also hardly work to solve the big issue mentioned by this Mr. Andreas several times of "bringing banking to the other 6.5B people on this planet".
Would BCH's short term solution result in a block chain which ends up being "too large to handle" or is the size of the blockchain still easy to deal with (also in say 5-10 years)?
Would/could the activation of the lightning network result in a new fork? How much do we know about how well the lightning network will perform? Are any other currencies using a similar system yet?

Thanks, yes I've noticed coinmarketcap, but the home page of the coin is probably not containing the most objective information about the coin (in particular if the design is "basically bitcoin"). I guess as you say at least you learn what they aim to do.

I understand that some altcoins are trying to solve some of the issues with bitcoin (and most are just trying to reap of the success), but I have a hard time to get an overview of what issues they are trying to adress (and to which extent they succeed or have a chance to do so). any recommended reading material out there? Any eli5? (or maybe eli25 with a bachelor in science is more appropriate for this topic)

Impressed about this being up for grabs still. Either a really good puzzle or fake, there should be lots of smart brains on this one by now

This is the essence of skin in the game. so so easy to sit on the sidelines and shake one's head.

I'm curious, what's the meaning behind the number 310?
@_date: 2018-06-03 19:29:33
Yeah, this seems to be a general concern that blocks shops from selling these. Which is a shame. Maybe they could do something like a licensed dealer, and make a way to easily check your serial number against a db from Ledger that quotes where your device should have been sold and that no other device with same serial number exist.. it would benefit all if they could be safely be bought over the counter.

I heard about bitcoin first in 2012, bought first time in 2017. I tend to think that all the time, but I think the regret would have been much stronger if I had owned back then and sold at say 100% profit, or what if I had managed to lose the data or lose it to mt gox? Your free braincells should rather focus on what lies ahead, no one can change the past.
@_date: 2019-04-30 06:08:36
What about when you would have sold all at 100$ because fuck me if this is going higher, then fomo back in at 800$ only to sell all again at 300$ because this is going to hell? There would be sooo many opportunities for bad judgement calls

First time btc crossed 5k I bought my first $10 worth. I have a bit more this moon around, like $12 at least.

Even there you might have a compromised printer for example, so you might go wrong. I think the easiest way to be "almost 100% secure" is to get a hw wallet. A proper airgapped old pc or rpi or something is probably safer if done correctly, but not quite what I'd call easy for a layman.

Housing doubling in 10 years sounds very good. I expect our house value to go up maybe 3-5% average per year excluding dips.

Tbh I think it is quite reasonable that confirmations aren't needed to buy a piece of cake, as long as there is some sensibility check of the fee added.
