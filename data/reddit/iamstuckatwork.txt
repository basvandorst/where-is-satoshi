Well if I knew that for sure I think I would take up being a Bitcoin day trader. I'll try to pull some speculation out of my ass.
Right now it seems price increase would depend on more money coming in mainly from new adopters since it could be safe to assume most of the current community is committed to some degree. So starting with the current given market valuation of roughly ~$350/BTC lets make a generous assumption that annual exposure to BTC will be roughly 10% of the internet population with adoption growth of maybe 10% of that. So overall, we have 1% of the internet population actually buying in with a conservation value of $1 apiece. That is only 30 million dollars added to the system. That is a drop in the bucket.
Given that my speculation is generous a adoption projection (which I think accurately takes into account actual wealth of the majority of the rest of the world) I would have to assume that real price increase would have to come from the top 1% wealthiest people/companies. For them to buy in there would have to be real incentive to do so. So I don't think we will see higher valuation until we have our own currency crisis like Russia is having right now.

I can, but I would only be interested in doing so if I got a solid team together. Additionally, I think for the initial core development team, shared ownership balanced with a payment mechanism could be discussed.
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:17:00
Those are certainly issues that I would have to acknowledge. 
To your first point, I can understand that issue completely and while I can see how an ignorant project leader could significantly slow progress and possibly direct the project in the wrong direction, isn't there room for learning and gaining experience on the part of the project leader? This could easily be addressed by having a savvy project director who works in tandem with the leader that could lead the development team. (Although this could bloat the team size...)
To your second point, if an agreed payment structure with a set amount that was tied to tiered goals wouldn't that work? Coupled with or without the prospect of shared ownership I think that is a reasonable approach.

Sure, I have heard this argument before but it works only in discouraging those without fortitude, vision, or commitment and backing. I feel like actors in Hollywood are equally dismissive of independent film makers and the like and yet some of my favorite productions are indies.
Anyway, I wholeheartedly admit I couldn't bring the concept to fruition by myself, hence the need for a good team, a balanced team. I am also trying to explore avenues of independent development instead of pitching it to 2K games since I would rather it not be hijacked by a larger studio..
And sure, I am a stranger to you and you haven't even heard the concept. However, if you are in Seattle and want to meet up I would gladly discuss details in person over coffee. 
 
@_date: 2014-02-10 02:08:29

You mention your concern of  not having a 'single-point-of-failure'. What are we to do if we lost you as the core developer? I almost see your potential loss as a single point of failure.

I will throw in my two cents. I was sought out online by someone (with a telephone number likely placing them in the NYC area-connections to Wall Street?) claiming to be purchasing in excess of $150,000 of Bitcoin a day. So much so that traditional means of buying Bitcoin online were not fast enough for their acquisition. 
Most likely this individual was attempting to pull a scam but in the event they were not, they were either a drug dealer trying to launder a lot of money or representative of a big money probably from Wall Street or the likes.
Either way, this is an interesting time for the future of BTC.

Hey look, I am all about killing babies, but unfortunately Roe v Wade is justified upon a flimsy constitutional basis of privacy. Like it or not, opponents are eroding away at the establishment of its basis at the same rate our privacy evaporates with NSA snooping. 
As for the racism issue, while discrimination is bad absolutely, and while I would agree that the civil rights acts WAS helpful and good. It runs contrary to the tenants of a free society. Also not every policy set forth by the government is helpful either despite intent. The perverse incentives of Section 8 federal low income housing has ravaged cities and devastated communities. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 19:50:04


Discrimination has not been eliminated at all. Discrimination is still rampant and not just focused on race.  In fact I would argue that discrimination against the poor is propagated by the very government that is supposedly passing laws to prevent it. 
Just look at the impacts of section 8 housing. It made de facto segregation practically de jure.

Those two issues do not make his positions and predictions on economics invalid. Nor does your comment actually address his positions on those issues accurately. Out of context you highlight him to appear extremist yet he has a perfectly logical argument for both those positions (which I wouldn't necessarily agree with...).
The Civil Rights Act was opposition is fascinating because it is rooted in the premise of liberty to be free to act openly in a free society. Ron Paul is certainly not racist but his opposition was rooted in the premise that government shouldn't be so involved in people's lives like that. Just like with gay discrimination in modern times, people should be allowed to boycott establishments that discriminate for any reason. 
As for abortion, plenty of people are on the fence about that issue. The wonderful thing about it though is he would have taken the debate off the national floor and made it a states issue where it should reside. We waste so much time arguing back and forth about it federally that we get nothing done...

@_date: 2015-11-03 01:34:00
This will be fascinating to observe. This will be the first real bull run where BTC will have direct exposure to the market and Wall Street speculation by Above Average and Average Joe. Not to mention that tax sheltered securities and investment vehicles will be able to pour money into the surge.
While this could be detrimental to the price I think the shorts could be outweighed by the increased access on the market. 
One additional fun thing to watch is that when the market closes at the end of the day BTC trading continues trading (24/7-screw bank hours, baby!) and most of these past few days BTC price has been ABOVE GBTC which normally isn't the case. GBTC has been a premium and usually a significant mark up in price. But with China apparently pushing things forward we might have a good old healthy feedback loop that picks up steam.
Prediction: if this continues with ~5% daily gains every day this week the MSM will being touting this remarkable resurgence further feeding the frenzy. Nothing else is performing this well in the market that I can think of these past few weeks. This could lead to new all time highs this month.

Further prediction. Since the MSM is picking up on this a little earlier than anticipated I imagine that the Silk Road seizure auction will be seen as an opportunity of a lifetime by a super rich billionaire. The likes of Donald Trump. They will buy the coins at a premium of 10% day trading average Thursday. Maybe around $650/BTC. This purchase will be used by the investor as a publicity/hype builder to add to the current frenzy. 
This will further push my anticipation of ATH valuation to occur WELL before Thanksgiving. This will probably pop at $2,200 on a really Black Friday.

Right, and regardless of the originator or even their intent, it is a voluntary process to buy in. People are buying in because it is a good idea. It is a good idea because it is deflationary and a good store of value when compared to FIAT and all the other benefits. Plain and simple as that!

Unfortunately, I was unable to watch the hearings (limited bandwidth). However, I wonder if the darknet was implemented if that would still be the case. While your theory is intriguing this is why I am not entirely convinced that it would be half as bad as one might fear, even if it were true. The thing is, while some major initial holders might be IMF goons or what not, I imagine that the other early adopters will come develop a truly free internet in time with their new found wealth. They would certainly have incentive to do it.

These complaints are legitmate, though. They need to streamline their website because otherwise they will simply turn people away which is not something we really want to happen but to be perfectly honest that is what they are doing to me. I have had two transactions with them so far. My very first was canceled (the high risk issue correlating to a 20% increase in price) only to be corrected after complained directly to Fred and then just yesterday my second transaction completely disappeared from the website and I wasn't even emailed to tell me that it was canceled. This is despite the fact that the money from my bank was ACH'd out to them yesterday.

No typical tenant would accept that agreement given that if they live paycheck to paycheck and they are converting USD-&gt;BTC every time they pay rent they are not going to be able to pay for rent when BTC =$1000 and you are now charging $10,000/month. 
In order for that to become a reality they would have to be paid in BTC on a fixed basis. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 13:47:51
To your points:
-I believe that yes, while most banking institutions will likely see bitcoin as a threat, they are in the game of making money. All it will take is some individual investors, or one forward thinking banking/investing company to see the potential of bitcoin (and more specifically for them the potential "investment earnings" it has) to make a giant leap and being investing and supporting it. It will be those major pioneers that will break the status quo and force others to either get up to speed or be left behind. Just think about in our own lifetimes how Blockbuster and Hollywood Video, giants in their own era failed to catch up to the up and coming Netflix; even HBO is not safe from Netflix. Bitcoin is the same thing. It will be ignored at the peril of those vested in all things money and money related.
-It is special for a whole number of reasons. Too many to even delve into at this time, but I suggest you read the many posts and discussions on its benefits. 
-And towards your concern about the total number of Bitcoins, that is fundamentally the whole reason why it is set apart from every other fiat currency in circulation. The hard limit is part of the fundamental protocol and more importantly one of the fundamental aspects that makes it appealing. If that were not a tenant of the Bitcoin protocol to being with I guarantee you no one would be talking about Bitcoin and it would simply be another flop.
-"If bitcoins are stored pretty much entirely on computers, how is this not a setup for critical failure in the long haul?" Holding Bitcoin to this impossible standard is not a fair test of its applicability. We would only lose it with complete loss of the internet and if we lose the internet entirely there will be a whole helluva lot of other problems to include issues with international trade, legacy banking networking and communications in general.
I can confidently presume that your dismissive nature towards Bitcoin for the time being is primarily due to your obvious ignorance of its groundbreaking and revolutionary aspects. I have hope that when you do fully grasp its amazing attributes you will come to realize why so many people are flocking to it as many of us here have.
