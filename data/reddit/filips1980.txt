Media are owned by friends of those who own banks. A very special demographic so to speak...

Keep evangelizing dude. Best way to strengthen any idea is telling success story.

Coinfloor in UK also low. Prices have been relatively stable since last Friday hence not much volume changed hands. Volume goes up as soon as there is a downward or upward surge.

Are you doing something illegal? If not what gives them right to close your accounts? Anything in T&amp;Cs? Is there a way of recourse? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:52:51
Yes and no, customers have contractual rights and they can go to financial ombudsman to claim those rights (at least here in England)

Why are people not taking them to court? Not calling police? There is a growing conspiracy theory that once you put your FIAT in, it is very hard or impossible to take it out and liquidate your crypto because of systemic and underlying scan whereupon the big fish of finance world (who are in on the scam) can transfer freely and millions of 'retail', small investors money is very often held indefinitely. This makes people think if it's not some sort of pyramid scheme designed to grease pockets of those behind it by taking all the FIAT from small players. Nobody is regulating exchanges. They need to stop this practice immediately or we should highlight it a lot in the media. It's not a problem for the money to get in so much but a lot trouble to withdraw for the average Joe. Although I've come across situations where people sent money and the money was not credited to their exchange account. Pyramid?

I bought at around 13k after xmass... meh. Then day-traded a bit when it went to about 10k to increase asset value (by around 14%) Now HODLing as too unstable for day trading for me ;)

1. But it's not money, right? Wink, wink
2. It would not stand in court on legal and technical grounds.
3. Greedy 'investors' not following the advice of community (max 5% of assets, only money you can lose, don't panic when drops 50% etc) are just gamblers, and it's not miners' fault.
Always blame someone else, typical snowflake approach...

No worries

You have proof of your money being transferred to them and proof of trading. Now, legally it looks like they stole your money. Not so laughable. You have their terms and conditions - can they show where it says they have right to hold your FIAT indefinitely?
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:47:08
Thing is, it's all bots doing most of the trading by volume, we, the little people don't make that much difference
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:51:35
Ahh, precisely, they 'lost' your money - legal matter.

Hi Max, I can spare few minutes next week to chat about bitcoin. Evenings are best, after work.
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:45:59
Sure, anytime after 4:30

Prices are not plummeting. Prices are growing unless you live in time two weeks ago...
