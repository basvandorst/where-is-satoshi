At the same time, I think if I had bought 100 Bitcoin in 2013, I would have panick-sold very soon. I keep thinking I am just wishful thinking. So i am trying to be aware of my bias and assholeness :)

Why you think that my arguments are empty, even though I supported them with facts.
Aldo, how is my post self-congratulatory when I don't congratulate anyone other than the artist for his art, but in terms of the substance imputed to the image, viz. adoption, price, etc. I find fault and support my argument with facts.
@_date: 2019-07-14 00:15:44
Yes agreed, but the original 5-year sleeper benefits without any effort, and calling him early adopter gives him credit when he was just lucky.
@_date: 2019-07-12 10:49:51
Haha, yeah I deserve. And thank you.
@_date: 2019-07-16 11:48:29
I get that and I support what you did.
I am dealing with the issue of the "early adopter" label, and how it is used, not by you, but generally.  
Your circumstance provides an interesting anecdotal glimpse of who some of the 2013 "early adopters" were and how active was their involvement.

How do you define "in circulation"?

Are you quoting a pathological liar (E. Holmes) to make your point?
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:25:08
Remember why Charlie Shrem went to federal prison? It was because he sold some Bitcoin to someone on Mt Gox who then later used it in some way related to illegal activity. So Charlie was found guilty.  Now after you inform yourself, ask yourself why JPMorgan should not be found criminally liable for providing a ship to be used in illegal activity.
@_date: 2019-07-20 02:02:52
"Adoption, usage and the price continue to grow"
How are you measuring this?
My opinion is that usage was highest in Mt Gox days when it had actual uses that were then judged to be illegal.  In terms of usage as in "I NEED to use Bitcoin", that was the highpoint.
Here you might have a point only if you define it well. But to say that Bitcoin is adopted more than in the past requires definition which you do not provide.  Some exchanges dropped some Bitcoin futures trading so in that aspect, adoption as a financial asset has declined. Again, quantify and define your meaning so I can evaluate it properly.
I think you can agree that price has not grown past some historical levels.
With all of the above, OK, I get that it's nice art, making the recurring point that Bitcoin has not died, and I agree it has not.  But to celebrate it as anything other than a fact is a bit self-congratulatory (I assume that just as me, you have bought some) and empty.
@_date: 2019-07-16 00:04:55
Great, thank you for sharing your perspective.

He didn't teach her anything about Bitcoin.
And it turns out she didn't learn anything about Bitcoin in the 6 years she had it, only to ask the question, "how do I sell this darn th thing".
Just goes to show you you can't force adoption, it has to happen naturally.  And also, don't assume someone that got Bitcoin in 2013 is an "early adopter".  She might be asking as uneducated questions as "how the fuck do I convert this to a kitchen" and staring dumb when you say: "do you control your private key"?

Ha!  A lot of people like that.  Good times.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:25:02
Basically, the idea is that people not into crypto have some misconceptions about what owning crypto would have done in their lives, and they assumes the best (e.g., they would have bought at the lowest price that happened after they first heard about Bitcoin and they would not have daytraded, and they would have invested all the money they had, and they would still hold all of it, or sold at the top).
@_date: 2019-07-29 11:57:14
So, then to follow the example, after bitcoin becomes money they'll figure out to inflate the supply?
@_date: 2019-07-06 11:40:22
How can the better point be on wishful thinking?
@_date: 2019-07-15 22:06:41
Do you think the term "early adopter" applies to her, or you or both equally?  I've been grappling with the term "early adopter" and think it should be applied to people that sought out Bitcoin, and not people who had Bitcoin given to them.  Also, see her question: is she an early adopter if she's asking you about how to cash it.  The question implies she didn't gather any Bitcoin-related knowledge despite being given a Bitcoin.
If you can take the question as not being personal, but concerning the circumstances and facts of your case this would be great, as this is how I mean it.  Nothing personal about you or your sister.

Great argument. Reminds me to short BTC when the market starts going up again...
@_date: 2019-08-30 12:39:08
This illustrate exactly my point: the BTC community has a subset of users who HODL not because they can but because they forgot.  So how much credit or glory we should give them is the issue.
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:36:55
Yeah, I guess my point overall is how weak the argument is. If BTC goes up because the market went down, then it's only a matter of time that the market will go up again. I just don't like the argument.

Got it thank you.  So Rehabilitation is a bit like trying to make investors whole, recognizing that converting bitcoin to fiat is imperfect and only a step necessitated by the bankruptcy proceeding.
@_date: 2019-02-26 15:07:32
Yes I follow your logic.  I think part of the problem is deciding what MtGox actually owned, and it's not correct to say it owned its clients' assets as that is true for any bank or broker-dealer.  It probably owned some IP and servers, plus some coins that it collected as fees.
@_date: 2019-06-17 09:56:14
As long as they figure out how to use BTC. If it's like gold, then you can see a 6x from here and then it will have equal mkt cap to gold.

Is there public info about the schedule of sales, part or future? Since he is bankruptcy trustee, I'd imagine these are public. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 17:13:01
Thanks.  I understand they can 0pay out the fiat claims, valued at the then-current exchange rate of about $480.
But then why isn't this the end of the bankruptcy as far as the creditors are concerned?  I am asking the question form the legal perspective.  Isn't their claim then satisfied?  
I have no answer about where the rest of the bitcoins should go.
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:51:12

No, I would not use it if it's illegal... But I will try to understand what makes it illegal and them make something just like it but that does not have the feature that made it illegal.

@_date: 2019-02-25 17:43:29
I see and it makes sense, but if I may some more questions: what issue does the Rehabilitation process try to cure?  I am just not that familiar with the Japanse law.  Is the issue that refunding creditors in fiat is not optimal because of the subsequent rise of bitcoin?  And if so, when does that rise have to happen for the court to then order rehabilitation?  Timing of how long bankruptcy takes so as to let the value of the asset increase seems to be a strategic component.  Again, I am trying to understand this more broadly, not just specific to the Mt Gox bankruptcy.
Suppose that Bitcoin got outlawed, and possession of it becomes illegal (just for sake of argument!).  Then would rehabilitation involve assigning bitcoins to the creditors to send them to jail? 
Just trying to think out loud and understand the fundamental principle of the rehabilitation.
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:02:39
Seems like a lot of people sell when price explodes.
You might have more luck if you can prevent yourself from selling, even if you wanted to. Enforced HODL.  How? I don't know.

@_date: 2019-06-17 07:30:20
No, look at the picture and let me explain it simply and the LNG I welcome you pointing the flaw in my thinking if there is one.
Bitcoin went up 6.53% expressed in USD.
Tether is supposed to be stable with respect to USD.  So expressed in USD, the "return" of Tether should be 0% or very close.  But the Tether return is expressed in Bitcoin (see the B in front of the price).  So in terms of Bitcoin, Tether should have gone down by the same percentage as the increase of Bitcoin in terms of USD.

Well but then why should the investors get them?  Disbursing is fine, but to whom is an important issue.

My issue with discussions about big vs small blocksize is that size is relative.  So how do we know BTC or BCH or whatever other fork's blocksize is "correct"?  There should always be room for experimentation, and things do change with time.  So maybe this is why the discussion is reoccurring.
EDIT: Only time will tell who's right, and whether there is only one "correct" answer to the question of blocksize.

Interesting, haven't thought about that. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 01:14:35
This answer is exactly why he is asking. Currently the IRS will treat an exchange of bitcoin for any other cryptocurrency as a sale of the bitcoin and a purchase of the other cryptocurrency.  Bidding a 15 cent chewing gum with bitcoin is treated as a sale of 15 cents' worth of bitcoin.  Hobby exclusions do not apply and although realistically the IRS will not chase after you for a trivial bitcoin transaction, it might, just to set an example, and it's very frustrating for adoption. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:07:42
Yes, I still think I'm late, but it's my fault.
I saw the news, I have the education to understand, yet I was not an early adopter.
So it's all relative, but in a very real sense I was late to adopt, but that's on me.

Yes thanks for the advice.  I am not the multi-million worth hodler, but my thought was sparked by something else, bitcoin used to be worth pennies, then tens of dollars, then hundreds, then thousands, and who knows, in 5-10 years it might be (who knows?) millions and then even a small holding currently could amount to something non-negligible.

Yep, that's kind of where I am.
I've thought of storing an encrypted version of the seed in several places, and then telling an attorney the password (as a word) and that is their task, in certain events they should go to my family and tell them the word.
This solves the problem with banks having the seed there.  And also the need to hide it.
The only crucial thing is for the person with the password not to know where the encrypted sheet is or to have a reason to ask an unsuspecting family member for "that sheet of paper he used to keep".

Greetings, and I see you've still got some zeal. But hear me out. 
There are many people advising you to get a lawyer, explore your legal options in consultation with the lawyers, then find the right legal venue and sue them. And you will win in court and also in the court of public opinion. This is the best way. And best for us too as it will establish a legal precedent. 
However, there are several reasons you may decide that writing posts on reddit is better. Here are a few off the top of my head, in no order:
1. The story is just a figment of your imagination.
2. The initial source of the bitcoin is suspect of unknown, and you can't really prove they are yours.
3. You can't prove you got the initial bitcoin as a result of legal activity.
4. You owe but haven't paid taxes on some of all of your trading profits. 
5. You were participated in some illegal activities, e.g., pump and dump schemes with these bitcoins, so even if they were yours to start with, they may not be considered yours after authorities investigate you.
I can come up with many more, but that's not the point of my post. 
I am not your attorney, or advisor or have any fiduciary responsibility toward you. I cannot, even if I wanted to.  
But if you want my honest and somewhat knowledgeable advice, establish attorney-client privilege by hiring an experienced attorney. Get 2 hours of their time to lay out the truth. They are bound by attorney-client privilege so you can and should be honest even if it hurts your case. Then ask them what your legal options are, and if they'd represent you.
If they do, just come back here and say "I found an attorney!" and then post no more while the matter between you and Binance is pending. 
You can only hurt your case by posting about your case. An attorney should speak for you. Any attorney will tell you, attorneys hate clients that talk without attorney present, clients that think they can talk and "help" their case. 
If you find no attorney anywhere willing to represent you, then this is a fact you should think about...
