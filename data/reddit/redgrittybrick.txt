Venezuela is **not** an example of a country with a fully functional cryptocurrency.
The Petro is a bit of a joke. The government decides its value. From what I've heard it is not in general use.
A few ordinary Venezuelans use Bitcoin as a store of value (as the country has hyperinflation) but have to exchange their BTC back into Venezuelan Bolivars in order to buy food or other goods in shops. This means BTC is not in widespread general use or a fully functional currency in Venezuela.

No, the Venezuelan government has already replaced their currency several times. Holders of old banknotes have to take them to banks to be replaced by new banknotes.

You are not crazy, every Bitcoin ATM installed in a shop is a marker of the failure of Nakamoto's vision. It is another place where you can't use bitcoin directly and so have to convert it to fiat currency (paying a hefty fee) if you want to buy something in the shop. The shop owner isn't interested in handling bitcoin, they are interested in floorspace rental income from the bitcoin ATM provider. The same for many websites that offer purchase through bitcoin, what they are mostly doing is partnering with an exchange that converts bitcoins to fiat (for a hefty fee) and hands the fiat to the vendor. More people may be *speculatively* getting into bitcoin but I don't see my local greengrocer marking the price of oranges in bitcoin.

Interesting that Venezuela is so low. It is said to be the third largest user of the localbitcoins service, after US and China I think.
[WorkingLime in Venezuela  guesses that 10-20% of Venezuelans use Bitcoin (or Dash)]( but maybe that's just among his local acquaintances.

But where it interacts with humans it is currently fragile not robust. People get into all sorts of problems with Segwit vs non-Segwit, Bech32, sending BTC to a BCH address, insufficient fees, excessive fees, recovering lost wallets and so on. LN adds more complexity and complexity leads to errors. Conceptually it is hard to grasp too, it takes time for people to understand that wallets do not contain money, that bitcoin are not sent to wallets even though we say that, that bitcoin are not sent to addresses even though we say that. That changing your locks after losing your key doesn't protect your money.

What proportion of customers pay in BTC vs USD?
@_date: 2019-01-20 11:16:16
they don't sell Bitcoin, they sell paper tokens you can redeem online for bitcoin. Which makes the process more complicated.
Initially at least, only a few of those 20,000 stores will sell these paper tokens.

- Do you use a payment processor or do customers pay directly into your Bitcoin wallet?   
- What percentage of customers buy with Bitcoin so far?   
- Do you display prices in Bitcoin or in USD?

the Eurocheque, used all around Europe, was only discontinued in 2002. That's 17 years ago, not &gt;40 years ago. They may have been only rarely used in recent decades but they existed throughout Europe.

Their web site says *"Buying things with BTC becomes a challenge as there is a very limited number of sellers who accept BTC in place of fiat money. You won’t easily find the online sites which let you purchase your favorite items with Bitcoin"*. The existence of this sort of ~~Bank~~ middleman must have Nakamoto spinning in his ~~gr~~ swivel-chair.

This has been a normal feature of markets and exchanges for centuries (maybe millennia), so far as I know.
See ["bid-ask spread" at Wikipedia](

I suspect we'll never find out. Most people with cryptocurrency seem to be HODLers who view it as an investment, not as a means to buy pizza. It is quite possible that in this restaurant, cryptocurrency payments are vanishingly rare or non-existent.

The article says "In the short-term, the newly created regulatory framework for  cryptocurrency exchanges may have a negative impact on both the trading  platforms and investors, because it would mean stricter Know Your  Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and customer verification  policies." 
In other words, the governments that run fiat are imposing their regulatory oversight on people and businesses running cryptocurrency exchanges. You bend to their rules or go out of business. Smaller exchanges expected to disappear.

There are many many different "theories" about the future value of Bitcoin. However, no-one can reliably predict the future.
Some things we know
- The value of Bitcoin is extremely volatile (see below)
- Almost no one uses Bitcoin to buy things (chainalysis report around 1.3% of transactions are buying from merchants)
These things may change but currently it would be very brave (read foolhardy) to invest money you can't afford to lose.
Approx highs and lows last 3 years vs USD
    2017    800 - 21000
    2018   3200 - 18000
    2019   3800 - 13000

Looks like the e-crypt.info domain was created 11 days ago. That makes it inconsistent with what you say about paying in over 4 months and what the site says about when it started business.
    $ whois e-crypt.info
    Domain Name: E-CRYPT.INFO
    Creation Date: 2018-07-20T16:09:37Z
    Registrar: Limited Liability Company "Registrar of domain names REG.RU"
Being recently registered through a Russian registry is the sort of thing that makes me cautious.

Are you saying that's a tampon ATM on the left? Wow - the future is here already!
@_date: 2018-12-24 00:54:56
No, Bitcoin ATMs are not like bank Automated Teller Machines, they are automated currency exchanges that typically take in local fiat currency (e.g. USD), take a cut and send BTC to an address you provide (e.g. an address in your wallet fro which you have a private-key).
If you already have BTC, you don't need to use a Bitcoin "ATM" to move it elsewhere.
Even if you have BTC in a custodial wallet, you don't need to use a Bitcoin ATM to withdraw BTC into your own non-custodial wallet

Who will inform the exchanges that you are dead?
How will your executor know what accounts you have?

The interesting question is: who is selling BTC in exchange for BsS and why would they do that? I suspect Venezuelans mostly use BTC as a very short-term store of value. You can only buy BTC with BsS because other Venezuelans have to convert BTC to BsS in order to actually buy food etc.
