Agreed on the Infrastructure.  I'm in the Milwaukee area and I've yet to bump into a stranger that actually Knows bitcoin.  The few that have heard of it usually mention Mt. Gox in little to no detail.  I usually take that opportunity to politely teach them about bitcoin and why its better.
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:35:27
I often give friends 5$ worth of BTC and Educate them on it.  8 of them wanted to know more and I set them up with Coinbase, taught them how/where to trade.  6 took there 5$, and forgot about it.  And 1 really stubborn drunk guy tried to debate me for an hour about how 'Its just like the Tulips!'...
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:09:25
I would like a platform where one could place a bitcoin wager on a game match.  SC2, LoL, TF2, TitanFall... etc Match based games.  
I'm guessing some sort of reputation system will be needed similar to Ebays rep system or LoL ratting system.  (Honesty, Skill lvl, Honor, Hacks).  If you cant find a data set to determine the winner, I hate to suggest this, but it may need to be based on player honesty...
Suggested wager funds will need to be submitted, if the balance is below the suggested Wager the agreement is canceled.  If one or both of the parties are claiming Bullshit, a system may need to be designed to declare the transaction Valid.
This is a rough idea, Constructive criticism is welcomed.

You can get more interest on btc savings from [Yubibao](  Depending on how well the traders do in a day. its typically 0.0001 * btc in savings account. and its paid out every 24h.

I agree with your first point.  I had a pretty solid method for trading between 8/13-2/14. I was actively trading dam near 24/7 during that time.  There was a big shift in February.  I was noticing more pool traders and aggressive bots practicing market manipulations.  I'm still in the positive, but suffered  significant losses on profits more then a few times.  Today, I'm just collecting interest.

I am mocked a bit here and there, and it IS frustrating.  It's usually by people who think highly of their intelligence, but are to stubborn to listen/research.  On the other hand I have turned more people onto bitcoin, then have mocked me for it.

I think exchanges may need some type of Order Limit. A max buy/sell Order Limit/ or slight delay may help with the Phantom Orders/Flash crashes?  Tho to counter this I could see them using Multiple accounts, or Creating a Pool of Traders to continue this trend...
@_date: 2014-07-25 15:03:44
I share your frustrations... I asked my room mates to use it as a payment network to paying me for Utilities/rent.  At first they were worried about the price volatility,  I Explained if I cash out right away, then there is no risk.  I also offer to eat the 2% Transaction fee from coinbase(in/out).  Tho i'm not taking a hit,  waiting for the price to pop above their purchase price. Doing this Utilizes the network, and it's much much faster then them writing me a check.  I've also passed out small amounts to about 20 people.  6 have adopted it.

I was up 1266% in Feb doing small safe alt trades. I took 3 big hits in  March and lost 50%.  Bought back that 50% when the price stuck at 450$ USD.  That lose put some fear in me, but you can't win if you don't play.  I'm waiting for the next opportunity to get back on the horse.

First Investment.  I've always been interested in getting into the stock market.  But I studied Bitcoin like a mad man a year ago.  Treated it like a savings account for a few months. Studied Alts/Trading. Upped my BTC Stock 400%. Mid Feb(2014) Lost about half when alt interest died, Bot Trading took over, and Phantom Orders became the norm.  With the way the market is today I'm buying up as much as I can afford. and in the end my Initial investment is still up 300%.

I've used it for the last 3 months with a small amount for testing.  It's ok.
I wish it had more security, and higher withdraw limits.
5k withdraw per month dose bring them stability. 
However, if your holding 5k in there and it goes 20x, it could take you 20 months to withdraw all your funds.  I would deposit more if these items were improved.
