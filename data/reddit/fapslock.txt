2^80 is the number of hashes required in a birthday attack against sha1, which would also require a similar number of storage hits, magnitude of storage space and/or sorting... So it's very possibly not the same amount of work.

Fractional reserve banking doesn't exist unless you can use non-cash as a medium of exchange.  For example, bank notes.
That is, you can't lend two bitcoins from one.  You would need to create some sort bank note redeemable for bitcoin.

It's like an Ayn Rand story, but with poor storytelling, unconvincing characters and an overly simplistic premise straight out of middle school.

if you're just measuring the temperature of the heatsink, then only the heatsink is 70 degrees cooler.
in other words, remove the thermal grease or decrease the contact with the chip and the heatsink will be even cooler than that!

Well, the way you phrased this is misleading.
A %20 drop is greater than a %20 increase.
So, if you gain %20 and drop %20 (regardless of which happens first), you are down.

By the way, if you're wondering if you're full of shit -- being on John Stossel's good side is a bad sign.
[followed up by another bad sign.  seriously, was Bitcoin on the talking points bulletin today, or what?](
@_date: 2013-06-05 23:44:17
that wouldn't be fractional reserve banking.  then you're just lending one bitcoin from one.
that wouldn't be a bank, really.  more of a vault or a safe or an exchange.  that would work, but serves no purpose beyond a wallet (and wouldn't be profitable to operate).
[this is a decent video that explains concepts like fractional reserve banking and fiat currency pretty well](
