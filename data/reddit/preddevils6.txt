If you break down the "grades" that have the US placing 15th and higher in science, math, etc.. into socio-economic rungs, our students perform as good or better than other top nations, so to say we have a crappy school system as a whole is short-sighted. We have a poverty problem on a scale that nations, especially the Scandinavian ones, do not have. Schools can't solve every social issue.
Vouchers take away from the schools that need the money and give it to a private school. If the voucher system was largely fair, i.e. truly random selection, buses provided for students that can't afford it, etc.. then I would still have issues with it, but I wouldn't be as vehemently against it as I am currently, but that has been shown to not be the case.
There will always be struggling and crappy schools as long as the US has such a large population living in and around poverty. Vouchers take away from the schools that need the funds the most and give to schools that could provide scholarships.

School has been great to me. What do you mean?

Simply put, vouchers take investment and brain power away from public schools and gives it to private schools. Overall, this hurts the quality of public schools. Weak public schools leads to the idiocracy your username suggests.

It does not put money with the kids. It puts the money into the private schools. You're argument is terrible. Just because I don't agree with vouchers, I think the system is fine?
