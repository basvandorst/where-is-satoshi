Not a Roger fan boy and I find both bitcoin communities toxic, however it's worth clarifying Roger has gone on record a number of times promoting segwit and lightning as good solutions but to his perception increasing the block size first is a higher priority / more immediate remedy to the transaction backlog/increasing fees. 
He obviously owns alt coins too but i don't think that should imply he had a alternative agenda against bitcoin. He could have retired years ago without dealing with this poisonous community(I include r btc in this statement). Luckily there are also rational people on both sides of the camp too but they're becoming fewer and far in between. To the rest of you trolls - well done.

Kraken will also ignore your support cases. No idea on Gemini but my short experience with kraken was enough to put me off doing btc day trading.

Hi, you're 2 weeks late (13 days to be more precise). I took the loss on the chin after no one on your team responded to my support case and I withdrew all my funds from your exchange.
I also work in fintech for a reputable trading company and the standard SLA for an order issue is 24-48 hours. Your response is the only contact I've received from Kraken since that time. This is beyond unacceptable but given bitcoin is still in a regulatory wild-west I wasn't willing to spend more money/life in pursuing the issue further.
Thanks for your response but 'it's in the backlog so no one spent any time on it yet' isn't very different to 'its currently being ignored'.

Sorry - newbie here and this confused me.
Is this what you're referring to:  ?

Not really a formal definition, but at (imo) times of market uncertainty or alt-coin bandwagons; I have 5-6 exchanges I am logged in to where I'm comparing rates and liquidity.
I don't usually day-trade but when I do I like to have options. AS such I fortunately haven't had to use Kraken since the last time I had issues with them.

It's very depressing to see your history of comments in that it shows you care about bitcoin but you are depicting such an unhealthy attitude that is exactly why the bitcoin community is toxic.
Not cool dude. r/btc and r/bitcoin shouldn't be enemies.

I agree. As someone who was Pro BU until about a couple of months ago when Luke was debating with Roger and I started to have more faith in the direction of core; (..sprinkle a few bad code releases in the mix and you lose a fan...) In any case, I have never seen Samson provide anything positive in the bitcoin debate.
He is obviously an intelligent guy who knows what he is talking about but judging by his tweets his attitude is more likely to stifle progress than push for it.
This is like tuning into the US presidential election and rooting for Trump because he provides entertainment.
Bitcoin will succeed regardless but I just think this will add more toxicity between the community.

I've been burned by Kraken before with a case from a month ago.
2 weeks of no response, they asked my ticket number on reddit. I didn't respond because that shouldn't be a requirement for SUPPORT; still no response to my ticket.
The only reason I still have an account with them is for emergency trading. 
I wouldn't hold my breath.

Not that it's worth justifying myself but for your benefit:
1) I keep the majority of my funds on a trezor
2) If you haven't noticed already the cryptocurrency space is still a wild west. Bitfinex / Kraken / etc are 'reputable' exchanges (using the term relatively), but would I trust them with my money? No.
I only use their services when I need to. Why? Because that's the only choice I have at times of market uncertainty.

Maybe Roger isn't perfect either but saying solid shit is good because it isn't diarrhea is slightly distasteful.
