Been a month and I haven't been verified yet and no response from support. If Gemini waits that long to allow me to even sign up so I can send them my money, I can't imagine how long they would take to reply to me when I actually have a  problem. Sticking to GDAX until Gemini gets their shit straight. Don't have any confidence sending my money to a company that doesn't answer help requests. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:03:17


You were wise not to, since there is no possible way it could ever get to that high, even if every single person on the planet used it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:45:55
Please tell me the price where it will reach absolute bottom so I can buy then, especially since you have a crystal ball. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:46:19
There was no "hitman charge." You have no idea what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:47:18
By that logic, any amount of fiat is a lot to pay for ___% of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:49:32
Gemini takes a fucking month to verify your account. If they can't even promptly verify the account of someone who wants to give them money, what hope is there they can respond to a problem?
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:45:49
What are you talking about? If you read the actual sentencing paper in the trial, you will see that he was sentenced under the mandatory minimum guidelines for the type of conviction he had. There was no choice but life in prison for what he was convicted for.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:01:35
But that's not a fault of a twitter address electing to decide that BTC is what it wants to associate with "bitcoin." The account hasn't violated any of twitter's policies. We can't have twitter suspend it any moreso than we can have domain registries terminate the bitcoin.com address. 
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:59:17
What does that have to do with whether this is the low or the high? If enough people sell based on people buying, this could feasibly be the new high.

It's at 0% over the last 24 hours. You want to delete this post now? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:10:11
I'm not brigading as my post history will show, I just think it is stupid and a misuse of twitter to report an account for hacking that you have no idea if it was hacked, because you don't like the message. I would rather  support r/bitcoin instead of but I'm not such an asshole I would report the account to twitter over it. 
@_date: 2019-07-29 20:58:52
That people actually believe in some stupid meme posted by a 16 year old on 4chan based on two predictions.
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:24:50
How does bitcoin being at 10k aslig it with the US dollar? Bitcoin being at $1 aligns it with the US dollar.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:47:45
So is your post no longer relevant since it is now at 0% over 24 hours?
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:16:44
Because I'd rather buy the bottom than the dip?
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:31:14
Mnuchin's comments and the Facebook Libra review is the cause of the dip.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:30:32
So how do you know this isn't the "high?"
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:06:01
Have you considered there are over a million people here and they might not all have the same goal?
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:24:47
I looked at the indicator from 2018 where he predicted 2k.

Stop posting that stupid meme
@_date: 2019-07-29 21:01:56
Wow, a whole two predictions. You really are an idiot if you believe in it. Have fun losing all your money.
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:23:32
You had plenty of chances to buy cheaper over the last two years. Someone will always want the price to drop so they can buy more. At some point you have to accept that you missed the boat and go wit the flow of everyone else who wants it to rise.
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:23:45
Traders? I buy and sell all the time to increase my position and take profits.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:45:20
I said yesterday I was selling before it dropped any more and got downvoted. Glad I did since now I can buy back and have a bunch more.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:38:00
No I don't; my point was just that you talked about this being the low when no one here has any idea which way it will go.
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:00:18
So greedy of me too. The price was swinging back and forth so wildly I thought I could make a quick few hundred bucks so I could increase my holdings.  Now I have to spend $2000 dollars to get back to where I was. I might as well have gotten drunk and just thrown my money off a bridge because at least then I would have had a good buzz to go along with it.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:30:07
I don't want to hear that anyone here supports the Trump Administration **and** Bitcoin based on what you've heard this week.

You wore that out in public? /cringe. 
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:10:24
Because people here will always downvote opinions they don't want to hear about price.
@_date: 2019-07-27 13:08:16
Damn. So let's say I bought 1 BTC on coinbase at 10k, then "sold" at $9500, then later used that $9500 to buy more bitcoin, sent to my trezor, then sent it back to coinbase and bought more bitcoin. Even though I have never sent whatever money I'm left with to my bank account and have the original funds tied up in bitcoin, I need to declare that 10k --&gt; $9500 loss on my taxes? If so, I'm going to need to go back and file some amended returns.
@_date: 2019-07-23 11:44:51
Jesus shut up with that prophecy nonsense already.
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:32:06
Honestly man, I don't know. I don't really know what I'm talking about. Sorry about that.
@_date: 2019-07-28 16:54:51
Thanks, that is very helpful. I guess I need to go file amended returns for 2017 and 2018, and prepare to pay taxes on gains for 2019. It sucks since I'll have to pay short term gains for 2019 taxes. I really appreciate it.

@_date: 2019-07-14 20:34:01
At what point does "more bitcoin" stop being more important than "more value per bitcoin" and you become satisfied? What's more important, 2 BTC at $9000 or 1 BTC at $18,000?
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:47:11
Jesus Christ. 100% of the time I have tried to short to be able to purchase more bitcoin, I have lost. Down $2000 in 15 hours before I FOMOed back in. I am sure it will drop tonight too because that is what always happens to me. Don't make my mistake and just put it in cold storage and sit on it for five years. I am such an idiot.
@_date: 2019-07-27 01:47:50
I still don't understand if I am supposed to declare transactions every year even if I am just transferring between coinbase and my trezor, or if I wait until I actually realize a gain/loss by converting to USD and sending that money to my bank account. I trade all day long and but btc and sell for USD, and then buy more. SOmetimes I send to my trezor and then send back to coinbase a couple days later and start again. Are all of those taxable events?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:38
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:32:48
This isn't correct. Coinbase has those BCH as they mention in their post about it. You will receive the BCH in your coinbase account sometime in January. You can withdraw your btc at any time from coinbase and you will still receive the BCH regardless of what you do.
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:16:09
From looking at his posts on patreon, he hasn't been consistently right at all. Look at the very first page from 2018 and you'll see he was wrong multiple times.
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:50:19
I know I know. I was thinking I could short it a little bit and make enough to purchase .05 more bitcoin. Now I am down .25. Sending it to my cold storage and not going to look at the damn price chart for at least a week.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:46:48
I was hoping to just be able to buy back in at $10600 but it looks like it is going much further than that. I feel for everyone who is losing today, but would love to buy back in at 9k.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:01:57
Everyone on this subbreddit constantly spams "HODL" but almost no one tells people to actually use bitcoin for its intended purpose. If everyone just buys bitcoin and keeps it, the market will eventually realize it has no practical worth and the price will plummet. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:19:32
I would but I can't wait a month for Gemini to verify me, so gdax it is.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:39:45
Thanks a lot for explaining that. Must be why no one is buying mine at 8k.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:46
What does 2k sell wall mean? Does that mean no orders for people trying to sell over 2k are being met?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:54:48
Why are there transaction fees on purchases? I have never used BTC to purchase something, but probably won't if I have to pay a transaction fee. Why would I do that when I can pay with a debit card and zero transaction fee?  Is this something LN will take care of? Do I also have to pay a transaction fee for sending BTC to someone? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:07:22

I bought at ATH of $5500 and it never dropped below that. Wish I had bought more then.

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:00:24
Not with that breed. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:52
Selling is disabled or transfers? I just transferred my BCH to GDAX without a problem. Haven't tried a sell yet.

Does coinbase report your gains or moves to the IRS?
@_date: 2018-09-09 19:51:07

@_date: 2017-12-07 22:19:49
Would be more interesting to see that as percentages.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:38:31
I disagree. One thing over the last couple weeks is clear, and that is that no one knows shit about future bitcoin prices, so the idea that it won't go below 11-12 when it had such insane upward fluctuations in one day is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:31:06
What happens on the 9th?
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:33:11
Same exact thing happened last month, which is why I sold so I can buy back low. Bitcoin jumps up 5% in one day and then people are surprised when it drops 5% in another day? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:05:31
But then I can't trade. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:02:46
Sounds like you don't understand how satire works. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:19:14
I would love it if the price absolutely crashed. My biggest regret over the last 3 months is not having enough money to buy more bitcoin. Would be nice to have it crash so I could buy in at 3-4k and actually own a couple coins, then have it steadily go back up over the longterm. 
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:31:22
How is it "that accurate?" It has gotten one number correct so far and one number within 12% for this month. Do you really consider that weird? I can't wait until six months pas and people can stop posting that stupid link.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:04:19
Well, not as important as a gain since you wouldn't owe the IRS money, but you would technically be filing a false return. The IRS doesn't state that declaring gains is more important than losses. It might trigger an audit though. In any case, the IRS is so understaffed right now it is unlikely they would ever do anything. They can't even finish Trump's audit and that has been going on for years. /S
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:44:58

I thought private key and seed were the same thing. Is a private key just some type of encrypted version of the seed? How do they get the money from the private key without having that pass phrase?

Where are all of the psychics and bitcoin wizards from one week ago that were telling us it was absolutely going to be at 12k by now? Just more proof that everything is speculation. Quit pretending you know the future.

I don't think you know what "exactly" means. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:56:09
If you only have 200 bucks to buy it is not going to matter whether you buy at 5900 or 6900.
@_date: 2018-05-09 00:15:48
You can't estimate the future value of bitcoin by "how far behind we are." Just three days ago you were saying 10k is a non event and only 12k matters, One day again you were saying the climb back up from 9.1 would happen "any moment now." Your calls are no more accurate than flipping a quarter in the air.  You have no idea what you're talking about. 
Recent quotes by you within the last week:
* "Wasn't wrong. We're at $10k. Going to $12k. NAV says I nailed it. All that counts."
* "Battle for $10k was over Thursday already."
* "If we don't make $12k I'll also be wrong."
* "we're a whisker away from $10k and it's likely to go this week-end"
* "$10k won't last long. It doesn't matter anymore."
* "I'm just wondering why people who can't make calls criticise people who do make quite accurate calls ?"
* "$12k is a week away if it is even that slow."
* "We're not going to $10k tonight, we're going well past."
@_date: 2018-05-21 02:02:23
Yes he was making some pretty confident calls three weeks ago, and if you didn't agree or make a call, it's because you don't know how to trade. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:48:36
Bitcoin isn't driven by patterns at all. I am willing to bet your pattern prediction is completely off.
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:50:13
He's called it multiple times. Ten days ago he said we would hit 10k last week and "To me it looks like $12k by Friday or Saturday." He loves making super aggressive calls that never materialize and then shaming others who don't make calls (because they rightfully have no idea what BTC will do, just like him). 
Best thing to do is tag Mr_P in RES so you don't fall into his BS. Go back and look at his old posts and you will see how often he is wrong. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 15:48:02
Oh yeah, it can go either way. Just sick of people make "definitive" claims about what Bitcoin is going to do. Let's all agree none of us know jack shit about what the price will do.

You are probably right that I don't understand it as much as most people. My thinking is that Bitcoin can't attain a high level of value if it is not being used by anyone, and it won't be used by anyone if everyone buys it and sits on it hoping to get rich (like me). We need mass adoption and use of bitcoin as a currency to increase the value. 
I fully realize that I have absolutely no idea if that is an accurate statement and that I am one of the people not using bitcoin as a currency and contributing to the problem.

What does Dow Jones have to do with bitcoin price? One is a value to usd and the other is an index number. They are not comparable at all.

That doesn't substantially increase the value of bitcoin. You do not understand bitcoin or what goes into price fluctuation.
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:16:48
5% is an "amazing discount?" How do you figure? Unless you are buying many bitcoin (which I doubt), the savings from this dip arte insignificant.
@_date: 2019-10-16 12:58:50
Yes it is definitely a taxable event per the irs last week.
@_date: 2019-10-23 23:47:27
So you're saying bitcoin's tradeoff is not being able to use it as a feasible currency in exchange for being able to hold its value over inflation? And what period of inflation? Because right now it is down over 50% compared to inflation on a two year period of around 6%.
@_date: 2019-10-23 23:50:23
I was planning to use it for house repairs in three weeks, but I can't because it is down $4,000 from when I started saving three months ago. I now have to take out a personal loan to cover the difference. Had I saved in USD and put under my mattress, I would have what I needed.
I understand bitcoin's price instability and have taken that into consideration when deciding to use it, but no one has the right to tell me I need to stop complaining about the price decreases and just "hold" when I want to actually use bitcoin to pay for things.
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:51:23

I don't "invest" in bitcoin. I use it as a currency - what it was intended for. So of course I am going to panic when the value of my currency drops so significantly without a corresponding drop in the price of items and services I was planning to use it for. It seems like you don't understand bitcoin if you don't realize that.
@_date: 2019-08-04 14:59:59
As someone experienced in getting fucked trying to short, I highly endorse this response. I'm down half a bitcoin in two months from trying to short.
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:17:34
Everyone here telling people who are complaining about the price drop to stop whining and just hold is overlooking the fact that bitcoin's main purpose as  outlined in the white paper, is to be used as a currency, not a long-term **investment** holding. So of course I am going to complaint when the value of my currency drops almost 10% in one day. 
Imagine someone has enough bitcoin to buy a $10,000 car, and then on the day they were going to buy it, they find out they are now $1,000 short. Please explain to that person who needs a car this week that they should just wait five years and they'll be able to buy a much nicer car. 
Complaining about large drops in bitcoin value is a perfectly valid complaint for someone who uses bitcoin to actually purchase goods and services, and the type of person who actually contributes to the increase in its value, unlike everyone who just buys and sits on it.
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:33:16

The 20 minutes is the problem. If you were trying to buy coffee with that, they wouldn't be able to give it to you until the transaction confirmed. Also you have to pay a transaction fee. I don't pay a fee when I buy coffee on my Visa card (although the merchant does).
@_date: 2019-06-16 10:42:49
What are you talking about? There was just as much activity herre three weeks on the rise to 8k.
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:06:17
Or possibly at the brink of another huge loss. No one knows.
@_date: 2019-06-16 20:55:59
That has nothing to do with the amount of activity on the daily discussion. Did you forget when it jumped from 7000 to 8800 three weeks ago?
@_date: 2019-06-13 00:26:05
The only thing I have ever done is buy and transfer between coinbase and my personal wallet, however it looks like the tax realization comes the minute you "sell" it, so whenever I have day traded and sold crypto I have to report that transaction, even though 100% of all my bitcoin is currently in my Trezor and I have never not reinvested the amount I "sold" right back into bitcoin on coinbase.
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:35:05
So 2 years ago when bitcoin was at 20k would you have said the same thing based on ":market sentiment and general opinion?" Because I can guarantee you market sentiment and general opinion did not believe it was likely bitcoin would go to $3200 or even 10k in 15 months. Bitcoin does not behave the same as other market products and no one knows a thing about which way it is going to go.
@_date: 2019-06-21 22:54:54
Every time you pay would be considered a taxable event. You would be required to report a gain or loss on your taxes depending on the price of bitcoin at time of purchase.

You have to measure its value in local currency because you can't use bitcoin to purchase 99% of products or services. When bitcoin becomes ubiquitous, then you can measure it in its own value. You need to be able to sayu 1 gallon of gas costs .00001 bitcoin and have everyone know what you're talking about. You fail to understand that you can't measure bitcoin's value until it *has* replaced currency, not before.

You have $240,000 of retirement funds currently and you are asking a bunch of 19 year olds on Reddit how you should diversify your portfolio?  No one here has any clue if you are "safe in the future" since none of us know which way bitcoin will go. 
Depending on your age and income, I would not recommend anyone put over 25% of their retirement in something as volatile as bitcoin. Regardless, You need to consult a financial planner or you are going to lose everything. Can't tell if you are trolling or not.

It almost certainly will not go that low based my history, and I will FOMO back in at $8700 in about 12 hours.

But let's say that through all this trading you never ":cash out" to your bank account, and ultimately end up with 5 bitcoins. When you finally sell those for FIAT, do you then report gains/losses again?

Thank God. I sold at $3800 to take some profits. Was freaking out and about to FOMO back in around $4200. Decided to wait a few hours. I'm done with day trading. 
@_date: 2019-06-13 17:17:16
That makes sense. I guess when I buy at 100, sell at 120 and buy more bitcoin, I have a gain of 20, and my new cash basis now becomes $20 instead of $100. So if I then sell all my bitcoin five years later, I'm now reporting any gains or losses on whatever $20 of bitcoin in 2019 might be worth in 2024. Pretty confusing. Looks like I'm filing amended returns for the last three years. At least I will get to report a loss for 2018 and get some money back. 
Is everyone with bitcoin going through this? Or are they just not reporting it at all? Can't imagine everyone jumping through all these hopes. I appreciate the explanation.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:41:47

Oh shit, really? I did mine through Turbotax and I know there was a section for cryptocurrencies, but feel like I ended up not including it because Turbotax said I didn't need to or something after I uploaded the report. Will the IRS receive a report from Coinbase regardless of whether I had gains? I figure if I get audited, since I didn't have any gains then there shouldn't really be any issue other than them maybe requiring I amend my return.
Edit: I used [this as a guide]( which says virtual currency is to be treated as property and I didn't see anything in it about using a virtual currency that didn't result in a gain.

I do all my transactions through Coinbase Pro and it has a report you can run that will show you exactly what your gains are.

For a retailer who has to use USD to pay their bills, they have to be able to trust that the value of bitcoin is not going to be so volatile, that a service of item they sell for $1 in the morning is not going to be worth 80% of that 8 hours later. Otherwise, the only way bitcoin will work as a currency is to immediately convert it to USD after each transaction. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 10:29:35
Because 90% of people buy it as a value to usd and no one actually uses it as currency. Pretty evident by the fact that even most people in this subreddit constantly state to "hold" instead of "use"
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:06:28


This is the number one thing most people on this subreddit don't understand. They think they can just squirrel bitcoin away and never use it and it will still go up in value. It will fail as a currency if it does not ever obtain universal adoption.

@_date: 2018-11-24 22:42:41


This is completely incorrect, because bitcoin at ATH has much more buying potential than bitcoin aty ATL. If I own 1 bitcoin with a value of 10k USD it is not exactly the same as a bitcoin at 3k USD value. Yes, I still own 1 bitcoin, but one has significantly less use to me.

Many are waiting, as it seems almost a certainty that it will go down even further. Of course, no one really knows. But yes, the fact that it has dropped 30% in a week means overwhelmingly more people are selling than buying (although of course everytime someone sells they are selling to a buyer).

This shows that you don't understand bitcoin, as its potential actually does have a value correlated to global asset capitalization and the number of bitcoins produced. E.g., one bitcoin can never be worth 1 billion dollars, even if every single person in the world started using it and replaced FIAT.

I would buy back in before it got to 8k if it started going up. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:30:32
This isn't necessarily true, as high price also indicates large demand, which indicates more potential adoption of Bitcoin as a currency. Price is absolutely tied into adoption.

With the exception of my initial $50 I spent in 2012, not a single one of my 20+ purchases has gained in value, and I am sick of waiting for adoption my retailers so I can actually use as a currency.

if what you say is true, why on earth would anyone buy into something that can be manipulated so easily by a select few? 
@_date: 2019-01-11 09:54:30
Yes, I did the same strategy then too. I sold yesterday at $3624 so I made $400 per coin. Now I just wait for it to continue going back up and sell again at $4k. I literally posted about the same exact strategy a couple months agoi. Don't be salty because you're losing and not gaining.  It's been going up and down like this for month. Anyone could do it. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:05:47
I just jumped in with $1000 @ $6830. Might have been a mistake.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:18:07
What forecasted drop? For every person who forecasted a drop, there was another person who forecasted a climb. Please don't act like anyone had any insight into this or that this is all part of a calculated route, or that this is a good thing for bitcoin. No one knows shit about what the price will do. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:22:16
It won't ever get to $0, because at some point, bitcoin could be so low that people buy it because they can now afford hundreds of bitcoins, and they have the psychological mindset that they should since that would have made them millionaires last year. I mean, if bitcoin was ten cents, would you not at least buy 1 bitcoin? Based on that, at some point in the price people will jump in and hold it steady simply due to that. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:23:41


That's a great investment strategy. It's like saying "I flipped this coin twenty times and it landed heads, so now it needs to land tails!" I'm sure it will work out.

Or if you want to use your bitcoin to buy a product or service. The "fundamental vision" is not to fucking hold it is to adopt and use.

Believe what you want. I sold two days ago at 4k and just waiting until it hits 3500 to buy back in. I've been posting about doing this for at least three months. You can find it in my post history. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:18:09


I've been doing this for four months and making about $500 a week from it. It's easy money.

You said you paid your tsxes. If you had a loss, why would you have to pay any taxes? Couldn't you declare that as a loss and reduce your income?

Sure you do. Every new redditor with a two week old account says the same thing.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:55:25
That's not one of the main reasons, as there is no significant decrease in transactions the last 4 weeks. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:55:21
Gee, I wonder why there is suddenly a lot of discussion when there is a 17% price drop compared to days of 1%. We must be bots.

Yes, been waiting for months to buy cheap. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:27:10
Recommending that people buy it and never use it as a currency is stupid advice if you want it to increase in value.

Anyone who says bitcoin can go over 200k doesn't understand economics and you can easily dismiss their comments.

Man if I could do anything it would be to forget I had bitcoin for an entire year, but I can't stop checking the price every day and thinking about what I could have used that money on before the price dropped and I lost thousands. I wish I had the willpower.

Lol, yes I guess if we are talking purely about the "number of machines running Linux" then Linux is the most popular OS. You could even say it is the only OS. 
If we are talking the number of machines running an OS then no, it is not true. Android is the most popular. It has a 40% market share compared to less than 1% for Linux. You think there are more Linxus servers than iphones?!

I said the same thing last week when it was at 5k and look at it now. 
@_date: 2019-09-30 23:31:37
Of course you can own less than a share. There are plenty of ways to buy partial shares.
@_date: 2018-07-27 22:27:25
You think 1 1000% increase followed by a 300% loss in 3 months is a success? It doesn't matter if bitcoin was worth 20k for a 2 day period 7 months ago if it can't maintain stability over the long term. 
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:14:20
That's a good point.
@_date: 2019-09-30 19:10:39
Actually it's like saying "I'm not buying any shares of google, unless I can own a whole share."
@_date: 2018-07-25 01:02:42
You need to research market caps. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 22:25:57


I would love it if that were true, but you can't make that statement with any more certainty than the people saying "Bitcoin **will** hit 100k...eventually."  No one knows and everyone is guessing. This was pretty evident by all the people claiming Bitcoin **will** hit 12k about two months ago. A week later it was at $6200. 
You mention the first ten years was to establish a "basic level of stability" as far as the network. More people, especially retailers, won't jump in until it also establishes stability with the price. Any  retailers that currently accept Bitcoin right now immediately convert it to USD. Amazon is not going to accept a currency that can fall 10% in 24 hours. 
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:31:05
Crash and burn. I'm pot-committed now, but if it ever gets back up to $13k I'm cashing out and jumping ship. I'll take my capital loss on my taxes and be happy with that. No way bitcoin ever gets to $100k with volatility like this. You're not going to get enough people to use it. No one uses it now anyway, you all just hold.
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:26:35
Statement supported by absolutely nothing. I could just as easily say top will be 25k. No one knows. 
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:14:57
I've spent four years researching the space and I am emotionally and financially drained.

Truth. One week ago every idiot in the daily discussion thread was saying bitcoin was going straight down to 4-5k and people would be stupid to buy now. I bought at 6600 and made a nice profit when it then went up three days later to 7200. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:23:03
Bitcoin will never reach anywhere close to 1 million if people take your advice and just hold onto it and don't use it.

@_date: 2018-07-24 23:27:21
People who think bitcoin has the possibility of hitting 1 million don't understand the basics of bitcoin. The buying power of the USD would be 0 if bitcoin was at 1 million because every single human on the earth would have to be using bitcoin and there would have to be 4 times as many humans.

I apologize for such a noob question but can anyone tell me exactly what to do in GDAX to set an order to sell all of my bitcoin if the price drops to 7500? I have read their guide so many times but still don't really understand the limit/stop and taker/maker stuff. I want to ensure I realize gains from this 14% increase before it drops back down to 6500. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:07:54
This graph assumes an annual growth of almost 500% a year. Bitcoin would have to grow at a rate of .50%. It is not doing that right now. Come back after the first doubling milestone he predicted and let's talk.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:25:05
I had mine on coinbase too. I transferred to Electrum yesterday. Read through part of the FAQ on this page for what personal wallets are and how to do it. Took about an hour of educating myself and now IO feel like I have a good grasp on it and feel like my coins are a lot safer. Only thing you have to hold onto is the 12 word password (wallet seed) and you can recover your money.

@_date: 2018-04-04 22:02:15
For Bitcoin to reach 1 million it would have to have a market cap of 
$19 trillion dollars. It would also be consuming 16% of the world's electricity. The second is not sustainable. The first would require an enormous adoption of Bitcoin by much of the world. Again, people who think it can go to 1 million don't understand economics./

It won't ever require you to update without giving you the chance to write down your seed words and/or making you confirm on your device that you know the seed words before proceeding.

As soon as it goes back up to 8300 I'm taking profits and buying back in at 7700.

I FOMOed back in at $4k a few days ago and then FUDed out yesterday at $3500 for a nice big loss. I can't do it anymore. I would rather lose $500 per coin than $2k a month from now. Maybe I will buy back in one day but I can't risk that much money when all signs point to it dropping even more over the next month. 
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:23:39

Ah, I see. Sorry to hear.
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:06:47
Yeah, you are probably right. I have a bad history when going with my gut. I will buy back in if it hits 6500. Just can't imagine this big of a jump without a correction, especially since there is nothing to back it up with and it must be manipulation.
