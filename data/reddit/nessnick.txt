I believe the localbitcoins KYC is not really a hindrance to trading in their platform. As far as I know from what I have read, they only implement them on large volume trades. So, if you're trading only a tiny amount of bitcoins, you'd not be required to undergo their KYC.
The problem tho is how effective it is. like -- can they determine fake ID's? Another question is how secure are their servers and how secure my documents would be in their care? With what I have been reading about their services, they don't have a solid support, and so I am not sure how other aspects of their company is performing.

for starter, bisq has trading limits, meaning you really can't trade in bigger volumes, hence limiting your earning opportunity. Another minor thing is you need to download and install it on your PC. I tried a way to create/access account via a browser and did not find any. If you're someone like me who uses desktop at home, and uses laptop outside, and has a separate desktop at work, downloading is a nuisance. lastly, they only allow btc to fiat or altcoins trade. I can do that on non P2P platform without the risk of being scammed/cheated at current market value.

due to external competitions, it's getting difficult to sell 20-30% margin. Maybe just minimize a your margin a bit?

It's disturbing how the scammer almost won the dispute. It means you have to double your efforts to save your self from scammers, I'm not sure if I want to continue trading in localbitcoins. :(

what? so by providing a national ID will get you a big favor from the arbitrator already? that's messed up.

someone is actually discussing above (or below, i don't really know how you see this thread) how bisq's dispute management is the worst in the industry with no signs of improving.
