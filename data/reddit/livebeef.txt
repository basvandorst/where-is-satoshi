* Read the 4 links at the top of the sidebar.
* Get a good free antivirus for your computer (recommendation: Avast) and don't download dumb things online.
* Buy from an established online exchange (recommendation: [Coinbase]( ENABLE TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION.) If you really don't want to tie your banking info into it (you shouldn't worry about it with Coinbase), try  (not recommended). DO NOT USE MT.GOX.
* If you don't plan on spending your Bitcoin anytime soon, make a "paper wallet" (recommendation:  If you don't plan on spending it away from your computer, download a desktop application (recommendations: [Armoury]( [Multibit]( PASSWORD PROTECT AND BACKUP YOUR WALLETS. If you want to have immediate access to your Bitcoin from anywhere, download a desktop client anyways and keep most of your Bitcoin there. Then put a smaller amount of "walking around money" in a "hot wallet" (recommendations: [Blockchain]( [Coinpunk]( Transfer your Bitcoin from Coinbase to your wallet(s) of choice.
* If you want a small amount of Bitcoin to piddle around with, try [BitcoinGet]( to get small amounts of Bitcoin for performing menial labor.
* A noncomprehensive list of brick-and-mortar places that accept Bitcoin near you is available [here]( (You will need a "hot wallet" (above) to spend Bitcoin at these places.) Noncomprehensive lists of places that accepts Bitcoin online are available [here]( [here]( [here]( .... The big ones are Overstock and TigerDirect, at the moment. More to come (quickly).
* Buy low **(now)**, sell high. Don't panic sell/buy based on what the market is doing; the Bitcoin community has learned that large price swings are common and that Bitcoin won't "break" during a sell-off. (You weren't around in [December](
Is all of this complicated? Yes. Overly? Probably. But remember that Bitcoin is still brand new in the eye of the public, and better solutions will be reached. Ultimately, it's about being smart with where you put your money, keeping encrypted backups, and not downloading files like "BlackHoleSun.exe" from sketchy online sites or setting passwords like "Password". Hope this helps OP! (Unrelated, but you can tip with [BitcoinTip](if you so choose.) :)

OP didn't say "unintelligently" target companies... Overstock and Zynga have both received small stock boosts since they announced their acceptance (current or planned) of bitcoin. It wouldn't be hard to present bitcoin as a PR opportunity at least, and a business opportunity at best. Plus, the "new transaction processing system" could be something as simple as Bitpay, which runs $30/mo without transaction fees for their low-mid tier package.

Coinbase charges reasonable fees, instant transfer from your bank if you connect a credit card, 5 days otherwise. My suggestion is to buy there, then transfer to a mobile wallet like Coinpunk. There are no iOS wallet apps, Apple is shadily blocking all of them from the store. Keep a small amount of money in it, $50 is reasonable. Move the rest of your BTC to an offline wallet like Multibit or put it in paper storage. Don't leave any in Coinbase's wallet... Not that you shouldn't trust them, but they're definitely riskier than storing your own coins **if you trust that your computer doesn't have a keylogger, trojan, or other virus.** You can get really security-Nazi about it if you want (using a computer never connected to the internet and whatnot) and many on this subreddit will pitch that, but honestly if you have a good anti-virus program running and don't click/download stupid things, then you should be fine. Don't forget to 2FA (2-factor authenticate) your Coinbase account. Have fun, and let us know if you need anything (but please search your question first)!

Why? It's a checking account, not a credit card. It's just a different way to store and spend your money. There's no risk involved unless you overdraft your account. Plus, you'll get a job soon (if you don't already have one) and you'll want a bank account to direct deposit to.

Magic internet money. (usually followed by more detail)
@_date: 2014-09-30 05:54:13
That's not necessarily true. Imagine this scenario: Two years ago, you bought what you believed to be the world's first consumer car that would be completely autonomous and able to navigate a future infrastructure of automatic roads. Let's call it the Moon. The Moon could communicate with other Moons, and work with a road network to drive you automatically, at super-high speeds and on solar power, wherever you wanted to go. The only catch is, the Moon doesn't have a steering wheel. You bought it relying on future infrastructure that didn't yet exist in mass scale. Let's say that this car doesn't follow typical economic rules, and you bought it for $5,000, believing that it would one day be worth six figures. What a steal! You bought in right when it was getting some publicity (hell, it was only $3,000 a week ago!) and it seemed that the road network would be rolled out en masse within the next few years.
Well, over the next few years, the Moon's infrastructure didn't come en masse. It's there, for sure, but it can only drive you from your home to that weird foreign market in the other side of the city, and despite its potential, it's losing value. It's an exceptionally innovative car, to be sure--it could be huge, if only people realized!--but, for various reasons, is yet unpopular. It's seen by the public as something in the domain of the tech-savvy, the thrill-seeking teenagers, and the criminals looking to make a quick getaway after a failed robbery. This isn't helped by the fact that the auto industry has been silently "persuading" members of congress to stonewall any regulation to roll out the Moon's infrastructure, under the guise of protecting the rest of the drivers on the road. It doesn't matter that it costs practically nothing to run. It doesn't matter that the Moon is everything that the sci-fi writers of the 50s dreamed of when they envisioned future transportation. The infrastructure isn't there, the public is wholly apathetic about it, and the Moon sits in your garage, deprecating, and occasionally driving you to that weird foreign market just to keep the engine in good shape.
Now, you spent $5,000 on this automotive wonder. You even spent a couple hundred more on the exterior to make it beautiful. Your Moon is your baby. But it's lost $4,000 of value since you bought it. True, the public could snap and realize that the Moon really is the greatest thing to hit the streets since the Model T--it really is only one PR campaign away--but the company that makes the Moon is tiny, and its userbase is relatively powerless.
Now, in your situation, what do you do? Do you hock it and at least save $1,000 of your initial purchase? Or do you keep it in your garage, its future value unknown, until some magical day in the future when the public wakes up, the Moon gets huge, and you can drive from New York to Los Angeles in six hours for free?
That is the (allegorical) reality that the big, initial investors are faced with. It's much more complex than a simple matter of money. Bitcoin is some peoples' baby, it's their brighter future, it's their claim to fame of being the first few in a future of the Next Big Thing. Don't patronize them when they lament their, or our, dissatisfaction of the way things are.

For the comp sci people, I get a bit more into the technical aspects, usually get about as far as explaining the public/private key scheme before they lose interest or go off to look at it on their own. But my first words really are universally "magic internet money". Worked for Reddit.

Just in case you hadn't heard of it yet. I  got it a few months ago and I still think it's hilarious. It parses every page you visit and replaces all instances of 'bitcoins' with 'magic beans'. It's hilarious when you see it in action, especially on this sub.
edit: Some examples from /hot:
* Stephen Merchant's very funny response to Magic Beans donations: "I didn't realize [Magic Beans was real money]. I thought Magic Beans was made up, like God."
* Could Magic Beans Tipping Replace Traditional Online Advertising?
* Where do I 'pay with magic beans' on expedia.com ?
* Just bought my first magic beans through Coinbase
It really never gets old. (I'm not a subscriber or anything, I'm a magic beaner who likes to laugh at magic beansers sometimes)

There are generally two factions of people who do this:
1. People who are new to bitcoin and have never experienced its price turbulence before (generally after a small bump in either direction in price).
2. Long-time users who have serious hodlings who are genuinely concerned about them, and want affirmation of the viability of bitcoin as a whole (generally after a long, steady decline (i.e. now)).

@_date: 2015-09-04 22:20:23
I didn't say it was incorrect, I said I cringed a bit when I saw it. Unnecessary uses of "literally" are too teenager-y for use in a formal application and sap credibility. Reading the sentence without the word I have no trouble understanding that "tens of thousands" isn't a figure of speech. The Bitcoin community needs to present itself with respectability.

No you weren't. You can't take any moderate growth that ever happens after your chart as validation. Any asshat can claim "bitcoin will go up!" and then pat himself on the back when it does. The implication behind that chart and this one is that bitcoin will experience *congruent* growth as before, meaning about tenfold, as defined by your own pattern. An increase from 400 something to 600 something isn't you being right, it's you being wrong. If bitcoin hits 5000 or so in the immediate future, then you can congratulate yourself on predicting the market. Otherwise, you're 0/2.
