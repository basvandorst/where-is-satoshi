I'm not suggesting it's an all or nothing proposition - what I'm suggesting is that if you're trying to hedge away from the normie financial markets, this is probably the worst way of doing it. While I could see the perception that banks have shady business practices, I feel that bitcoin is considerably more opaque in its practices.

I'm suggesting that we don't know if it's evil. In general, neither are the financial markets - the financial markets have a profit motive, which at times are at odds with the average consumer's motives. So to us, the banks seem evil - they just have a self interest, just like we have a self interest. 
Are you assuming Bitcoin doesn't have players with a profit motive? Literally everyone involved in Bitcoin has a profit motive, which is at odds with your own profit motive. By that definition, Bitcoin is more certainly "evil". Now, whether that's right or wrong, profitable or not profitable, only time will tell.

Are we certain Sathosi isn't a corporation? I understand being apprehensive of banks, but there is no reasonable way we could know that this wasn't set up by a corporation. Not to mention this shadowy character owning such a large stake of it, or the majority of bitcoins being owned by a very small proportion of entities.

Banks don't compete with currencies - they compete with consumers. The bank doesn't really care whether you're holding USD or Bitcoin - is coinbase anything other than a repository of currency, much like traditional banks? Are they doing it for free? Do they have a profit self-interest? 
I'm not giving you a hard time about owning bitcoin, but I think those of you owning bitcoin as a means to get away from the traditional finance institutions are trading a known evil for an unknown evil.
