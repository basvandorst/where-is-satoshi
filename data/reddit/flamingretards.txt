I want to start by saying thank you for trying to help even when the thread is almost 1 day old. What I meant is that when I typed it into blockchain with zeros instead it did not even ask for my passphrase just flat out denied the adress. Today I did however scan the QR code and tried writing the passphrase and it did not work. So I think it has to be the passphrase that is incorrect since I don't think it can scan qr codes incorrectly while still letting me type the passphrase.

I would say that I am average in the technical departement. As far as the passphrase goes I thought I had it written down 100% correctly but apparently that is not the case, but it should still be like 90 % correct. This John the Ripper things sounds like something that might work. So is it able to try it directly at blockchain.info or do I have to copy / paste every possible combination it comes up with?

Thank you! I will have to use this as a last resort if I can't solve it myself. As of now I still don't feel safe handing all the information to a stranger.

I solved it man, I edited the original post so everyone can see. Thanks for offering your help :)

I used spaces :)

IIRC I did copy / paste the private key into the company website and then freestyled a passphrase which I wrote down on a piece of paper at the same time.

Thank you! I still haven't failed enough to feel that I need this service. Once I am all out of options I will probably have to use it as a last resort.

Typing the key into blockchain but I always get the wrong passphrase message when I type that in. Also tried scanning it with blockchain but get the same error there with the passphrase. Currently on bitaddress trying different passphrases which I've also done before:)

I appreiciate any tips! I understand what you mean, I will have to try different combinations :)
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:26:35
Alright thanks for the heads up, I will not try it on there. Have not downloaded it yet. Will download it later if I am still without success.
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:32:24
The amount is significant so definitely worth using a service. Do you have any recommendations that are trustworthy? :)
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:30:30
I already solved it man, I edited the original post so everyone can see. Thanks for offering your help :)
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:38:49
No not yet :(

I have read somewhere else that BIP 38 does not use upper case O and zero to avoid mixups. I just tried replacing all the lower case O with zeros and blockchain would not even accept that private key. Yes the private key starts with a 6.

I have tried this with no success, I'm gonna try it again tonight with some different combinations. I probably just have to keep trying until I guess the correct one. Thank you for the tips!

I tried removing letters from the passphrase like you said but no success sadly. The passphrase I only wrote down by hand on a piece of paper so I don't know how big the chance is that that was the mistake.

Sorry but what is a "pass out"? The private key I copied straight from bitaddress into the company website. The passpharse I just typed up on the spot but as I typed it I wrote it down on a piece of paper. I probably checked it multiple times but still no success today. I just wanna say that I really appreciate you taking time out of your day to help me out. Thank you :)
