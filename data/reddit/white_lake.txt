Definitely looks more like gambling than investing to me, I believe 90% of the buyers don't have a clue what they are spending their money on. 
The only thing they "know" is that it can only go up in value.

Using BitPesas website was a great experience too. After I had authorized the transaction from my phone it took only seconds before a window popped up and told me that they had received my payment.

Thanks, it worked for me to cross post it in when I tried the same in it gave me warning that maybe I was too new or my posts were not liked enough :) maybe I will try later, otherwise feel free to do it for me ;)

I have no idea. Maybe you should start a new thread with that question..

go there and you will find them!
actually calling him my friend is a little bit exaggerating...I will try to tell the story:
I got to know him because I brought my old PC parts (motherboard, graphics card etc) with me and tried to sell them, hoping I could maybe get a hotel bed or something similar for them. 
When I was in Brazil the year before I had noticed how they were all using really crappy hardware, like the kind we throw in the bin when we buy a new PC. And I promised myself that I would not throw out any working hardware, but instead take it with me on my next journey to a poor country. 
This is perfect for weight allowances as well: The 20 kilogramms that you are allowed to take with you can consist of:
flying out:  10kg clothes etc + 10kg computer parts
flying home: 10kg clothes etc + 10kg souvenirs
Back to the story. After having shown my gear to a couple of internet cafe people, someone introduced me to Gerald. He speaks very good english and is really bright, could identify all the parts in my box and priced them as I would have. In no way does he resemble a trader or crook, he is very quiet, kind and mellow. He took me to different possible buyers, this was a great way to see behind the scenes that tourists usually get! One of them was the church that he digs (and which I wish he didn't), its crooked leader made him put all the parts together to see if it worked and then didn't want to buy it...but in the end this was great, because I gave everything to Gerry and he is now still running on my good old AMD64 3000. In return I got invited for dinner in his (+wife and 2 children) truly very humble home: a 20 sqm room inside a concrete building, one window-sized hole covered with a curtain to the neighbour's room, one door-sized hole covered with a curtain to the hallway. You can hear every noise from every neighbour all the time.
I decided then that instead of spending money on charity organisations (where half goes to administration), that I would send my money to Gerald directly instead. I have to admit that I had planned to send him more than I have done, sometimes thinking that he needs to get along by himself. But it is so much harder for him than it is for me, those 12€ I sent him today feel like 200€ for him.
**tl;dr: I don't really know my "friend" all that well, but I would like every "rich" westerner to have one. Because we are the reason that they are poor.**

sounds like a good idea.
so can I somehow link to this thread or do I have to create it like it is new?

-not to mention BTC volatility: when I first wanted to send it, BTC was at 480€ (50€ more than today)
I use bitcoin.de to buy, they charge 1%

unfortunately this is in german only, but it shows how the western world makes it unprofitable for the local farmers to grow their own crops. Africa could easily support its people if not it was exploited..

Mpesa is the currency they need, so they would still need to find a way to convert the BTC from their wallet..
and it's definitely nice that you can use any old crappy phone as your bank account!
