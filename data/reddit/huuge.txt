I have both seeds safe and sound. I’m 99.9% sure you can’t have two seeds set up on a Ledger at the same time. But if I *could* have them both on there, another reason I’d want to move the Mycelium funds to my Ledger is because it’s a segwit address. Mycelium doesn’t support segwit. Nevertheless, thanks for your time.

As others have said, Gemini. Clean UI. Pretty easy to understand. Weekly updates.*Usually* cheaper than Coinbase/GDAX. But you’re always going to pay the 0.25% fee on Gemini. On GDAX you pay 0% if you’re a maker.

What's the cheapest way I can get my BTC off of Mycelium and into my Ledger? Mycelium doesn't allow you to send using custom fees. Only lets you choose from Low/Economy/Normal/Priority, and doesn't say how many sat/byte each of those are. 
[I see that the mempool has been shrinking]( and that's delaying me from sending the BTC over to my Ledger because the longer I wait the cheaper it's going to be. I would gladly use a very low fee and wait days because I'm just sending money to myself.
I remember reading something about getting some other wallet (one where you can set custom fees), then use my Mycelium seed on the new wallet, and transact from there. Any validity to that? Which app/wallet could I do that with?

No, I haven't. I'll look into that and give it a shot. Assuming I can do that, I'd use my Mycelium seed on the Nano S, then just send the BTC to my address that I originally had on the Nano S, then reset and go back to the original seed that came with the Nano S and everything should be good, correct?

It’s true but definitely not recommend.
Just imagine you had some other hobby that cost you $200 (or however much you’re putting in to BTC) a week. I know some people that go to strip clubs twice a week that blow more money than that. Their money is gone. At least with cryptos you know that if the price goes down you’ll be able to get *something* out of it in the end.

Downside to Gemini being their fees are much higher.

It'll be in 2018 if Bitcoin has the same amount of growth it did in 2017. And the year isn't even over yet.

Duped how? By who? It takes 5 minutes to use one of the hundreds of mining calculators out there to see how profitable mining is for you.

You don’t mine bitcoin specifically because you think it’s going to go up, you do it because it’s more profitable than straight up buying bitcoin. If you thought bitcoin was going to go up, it would make more sense to take the money you would spend on the ASIC and electricity and buy bitcoin with it.
