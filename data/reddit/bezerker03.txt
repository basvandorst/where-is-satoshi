Let it be known, serbians rock. This is all. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 12:59:26
Oh, they are economically and politically in a meh position, but Serbians as a general people are great.

As the owner of two ferrets, I can confirm this is acceptable.
Also, make sure they are shiny strings. They will remember it better.

That's completely fine. You can have the society you want.  Just don't complain then when at the end of the day citizens have no recourse against government force whether it is policy or physical.  
Luckily for you, you indicated you live in a country where this is not a problem currently.  For whatever reason, policy seems to be enough to keep your government in check.  Here in the US that is not the case these days as more and more police militarization occurs as a result of hand me downs from DHS and DoD.  The idea that if you are arrested falsely your charges will likely be dropped before even hitting court is long since gone as nowadays there are hundreds if not thousands of potential charges which will be filed alongside nearly guaranteeing a requirement for a lawyer etc.
The current US powers since 2001 have pretty much made it clear on numerous occasions that they are arming and preparing to deal with domestic violence, not foreign.  Hopefully we never see that day.
Point is though, there's a power creep drastically growing but voting does nothing to stop it, and more and more every day is the same old story of "police seize assets from suspect without arrest! never return" or "random abuse of power for dude holding a licorice stick up!".  It's not going to change through vote, talk, or policy and it's been clear as day for awhile now. 
Tldr version is that that's a fine idea, but in the current US system the concept that policy and voting can control the growing power abuse (thus preventing the above situation) is disappearing slowly over time.  
Take the Bundy protest as a fine example.  It wasn't until men and women arrived and had arms pointed towards the federal agents did they cease.  Whether you agree with what the reason was or not it's a clear demonstrateable point that shows that IF a government power decides to do something against your will, a show of counter force is the only one that can diffuse the situation without one side winning completely.  The day that they decide bitcoins are contraband or whatever the interesting term at the time is and they start performing no knock raids at night to seize your electronic equipment and arrest you, there must be someone there with arms to resist that if they choose.

:( My face when someone named ferrets4eva calls a ferret a rodent. :( They are not related to rodents at all. :( They eat rodents. :(

And I now switch back to you from newegg. Well done. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 13:02:25
Nah according to our gov (us) those guys were just terrorists. (no seriously the founding fathers have been labeled terrorists in some school books and modern things now) 
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:08:24
I know. He's too sure if himself being the top predator but he's never seen a ferret full war dance.... The horrors... 
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:57:34
Can confirm: Ferrets are vicious creatures. Just look at this vicious battle between a dinosaur and a ferret: 
@_date: 2014-09-20 08:09:53
In case you didn't notice, most of that isis stuff is fabricated.  We've had plans in the us to go into Syria for years now.  
@_date: 2014-10-11 03:16:56
There's a large group of us trying to keep us even remotely able to defend against that, but we keep getting roadblocks put in our way by the same government currently stocking up on ammunition. 
Its almost like they want to remove the little chance we have of defense whilst arming themselves. But nah its to save the kids.

Actually a dod training manual that was found via Foia request. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 00:39:50
Generally the rest of the devs follow the arch way as well, so this should not be an issue but of course it could be. My point was simply that arch has an ideology that actively combats this by ensuring packages are as minimally changed from upstream as possible. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 14:20:50
One example. Sorry for the source being a crappy one but the actual dod foia can be found elsewhere. (on mobile now) 
Particularly the post about the us founders being extremists in the same boat as 911 hijackers. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 22:06:42
He's right though. It will lead to a dark place. That place will be a dystopian future world of control by the state 
@_date: 2014-10-11 03:13:32
Not every politician is. There are plenty of candidates that are not. They are generally not of the two major parties though. This makes people not vote for them.  (with good reason. The system is designed so that if a third party is introduced one of the original two nearly guarantee win). 
@_date: 2014-10-10 13:01:03
This is why I stopped using many distribution and embraced Archlinux. The arch way ensures packages are released as close to upstream as possible. 
It's a shame this is happening because gentoo deserved more modern reasons to use it, not abandon it. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:59:40
This can be accomplished using "LitterBox 1.0" or higher.  Really simple. Your ferret will automatically back up into the box and drop off its private key.
@_date: 2014-10-10 13:04:38
Yes he is. He is the package maintainer.  The only distro with such a strict no modification policy is arch
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:49:54
Unless the owners of those atm are living fine off of the 1% that use it. You always have the option of opening your own and under cutting them. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 14:22:13
In fairness, banks have nothing to do with freedom. They're private companies you give your cash to under contractual grounds. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 14:20:43
Yes. You are giving your money to someone else with the guise that they store it keep it safe. 
The key is the first part though. At some point in time, you gave someone your money. At that point, while you may have legal contractual options, it's not your money anymore. 
edit: Downvotes because people don't understand that when you give a bank your money its technically not your money anymore?  And that the only safe way to ensure your money remains yours is to ... not give it to other people? Regardless of the purpose? lol.
@_date: 2016-06-09 13:10:43
To get paid. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 21:18:35
The only reason that 100 dollars would still be yours is if the contract (verbal or written)  stipulates so and that the money will be there and untouched the entire time. A bank is not that. The contract legally allows them to reinvest your money and return it under defined (usually complex and full of small print) conditions which are mixed variety when it comes to whom it favors. We've made improvements in this where we have several laws that state the consumer is protected in certain ways but ultimately it's no different than any other private transaction. 
Think of it in the most simplistic way: if you just willingly gave a person you knew money without negotiating terms of an agreement, they would have no legal or contractual agreement to keep that money for you or even return it. The bank is a private persona or business. 
The only true way to own your cash and remain true ownership of it is to not give it to third parties, but that has its own risks. (break ins, fire, etc)
@_date: 2015-08-10 10:21:03
Excellent. Thank you.
@_date: 2015-08-09 17:05:23
Well this is kind of horse shit. New Yorkers have been shown time and time again we have no control over laws passed here. :(
@_date: 2015-08-14 21:22:02
That's the point. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 17:03:40
Wait... If I'm not mistaken I was directed to submit my gox claim though kraken and i did.  I'm in new York. Wat do?
@_date: 2012-03-03 15:41:57
Over priced in some cases but not many. My linode has been up for over a year now. To the point I really need to reinstall because I'm so far behind my distros upgrade path. 
Their customer service rocks and the servers are very stable. 
Sure you can find cheaper alternatives but I found the lack of support and uptime lacking. 
@_date: 2012-03-03 15:38:12
No details? They said it was an error in the customer service portal and it has since been fixed. I've been a loyal linoder since its early days. I thought they handled it quite well. 
This post is a bit extreme imo. You have to realize when you use someone else's service that is not free (open not monetarily free) that shit can happen. 
Or have we all been so corporatized that we forgot basic security beliefs?
@_date: 2012-03-06 04:01:41
I really dont get this. I've been a linoder for ages.  They've always been great. 8 out of the ridiculous number of nodes were affected and the issue was resolved. It does not matter other than the fact they admit it happened, and that it's been resolved.
It's not a free (open) software/website. You got as much info as you can expect from them.  Having dealt with Caker plenty of times on IRC for various things in the past several years, I highly doubt there's any form of maliciousness or secrecy etc going on here.

The argument of serious prison time for victimless crimes is however one thing that should be up for review. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 02:05:27
You can indeed have 100 different passwords, and you probably want to protect your facebook account as well as you do your bank since based on the even above average user your facebook page will contain information that can lead to the determination of the security questions on your email account, then leading to your bank account.
There is a reason social engineering experts phish information like name, address, and other "unassuming" info from you to get into your shit.

Ask me about python and Linux in the same sentence as .net and you've proven to me you will be a terrible employer. Sorry no.

If people didn't expect a crash they probably shouldn't be gambling with investments. 
Never invest what you can't afford to lose completely. 
This is common sense and if there is a large group of people that didn't understand that, well now they learned something important in life.
