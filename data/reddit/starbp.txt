Acquit sounds like what they are hoping for right now.

...but that just means *nobody else* has them, not that *they* have them. Think of Bitcoin like a gigantic public room full of lockers which cannot be opened in any way without a key. At any time someone can go up to a kiosk and receive a random key with instructions on how to get to its locker... there are enough lockers so that the odds of receiving a duplicate are low enough that it's not worth the effort to try. Every locker has a slot to insert money into and a view portal to see how much it has in it, but you need the key to get any money out. If you don't have the key, you have no control over the money and no way of proving that it is yours, since anyone else could claim the same locker. Oh, and the locker owners are always looking for workers to verify every money transfer, but they give their pay based on a lottery system where the amount of work you do determines how many tickets you get... also, all the money in every locker was once distributed in this way.

Yeah, it went down for about a whole minute, flashed quickly between 100 and 500 for a few seconds, then started rebounding back up for the next several seconds.
@_date: 2014-01-01 20:19:49
The people who pay cash are also indirectly paying for it though.

In that case, the technical limitations to actually performing a 51% attack and the logistical concerns of making sure everyone keeps their Bitcoins still apply.
@_date: 2014-04-03 10:40:26
Everything changed when the Fire Currency attacked.

[This one]( is the main MtGox wallet... not that it has anything in it anymore.
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:17:34
Or MtGox's owners...
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:10:23
The problem is we don't know which coins those are. Also, even if by some magic ( ^the ^Gathering ) we *did* know exactly which addresses belonged to Gox, many of the coins have gone through several legitimate transactions, and taking them from their current places would be just as bad as the police stealing $100 bills from random people just because those bills were used in illegal weapon transactions years ago. Not to mention that's not exactly how a 51% attack works... with *just* 51%, you would need many years to possibly even centuries of time to catch up your fake blockchain with the real one... on top of that, *everyone's* Bitcoins would be wiped and given to the current miners... a pool doing this would literally have to mine an entire new blockchain with hundreds of thousands of blocks in it (at least as many as the current one), make sure nobody else mines on this fake blockchain, and then give Bitcoins to every address that currently has them other than the Goxcoins once the new chain is accepted instead of the old one. Meanwhile the price of Bitcoin would plummet if someone actually managed to do this, even if the pool did the transactions correctly and didn't take any of the coins for themselves.

AAH RES IS THE ACTUAL MURD-
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:54:59
Oh sorry, I'm new to the innards of bitcoin, does he basically encrypt a message with his private key, then the address is used as a public key to decrypt it? Or how does it work?
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:12:20
The inability to easily buy Bitcoin without my parents noticing (i.e., without having to leave the house) is why I didn't invest that $100 that I wanted to back when Bitcoin was at 5 cents each... now I own 0.5 BTC rather than 2000.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:10:57
One satoshi, or 0.00000001 BTC, is the minimum possible amount of bitcoin in a transaction.

Install [this]( and then tell me to laugh at and ridicule you again...

What says that this isn't another bubble, which will go down to about $300 in a couple of weeks?
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:36:20
Not really. It's made for the sole purpose of making someone else rich. However, it usually fucks you in the process.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:49:51
Same... except in my case the person meant to put $1.
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:08:53
I spilled a bitcoin on mine. Need one grape soda.

Thank you. I now have you [tagged]( as Bitcoin Brony. Incidentally, if an Equestrian bit coin is equal in value to one bitcoin, then a cherry costs roughly $2,000.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:55:44
Opposite problem here... If it wasn't for the fact that my parents would probably not have let me get something which was primarily used to buy drugs at the time (so I didn't bother to ask), I would have invested $100 in bitcoin when it was around 5 cents (that's 2,000 BTC). Mostly forgot about it until it was at $500, now own half of one.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:42:06
Apparently you have the Cutie Pox... Enjoy your Bitcoin trading prowess while you can.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:59:36
6 days if it continues going down without slightly un-correcting first, 11 days if there is a short (a couple of days) rise.
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:13:55
I would prefer the 500 bitcoin myself...
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:28:53
It's a test... if you enter anything (or nothing) into it, it will say "This is a test. You have failed it."
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:43:29
$300, either 6 or 11 days from now.

The point of the post was to say we reached $1,000 before we should have... however, that is based on the assumption that we aren't just in another bubble.
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:03:05
If you could even *get* 100,000,000 Bitcoins, you deserve it... whatever "it" is, since there don't exist that many.

Send exactly 69 satoshis (0.69 microBTC or 0.00000069 BTC) to any address to prove you are the right person.
