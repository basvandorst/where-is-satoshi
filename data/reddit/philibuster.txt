That's not a problem AT ALL.  That's a SOLUTION.  Bitcoin can be used to SAVE AND SPEND.
So you save 1000 of those bitcoins and spend the rest.  Meh...big deal.
Even if you save all of them thinking you're going to be super rich, if it's the default currency you're going to HAVE to spend some to live.
You also just can't sit on your butt to make more.  You have to work--unlike our current bankers.

Stop trying to give bitcoiners viruses.

Wouldn't it be sweet if Coinbase could operate "Visa" transactions but with bitcoin based on current exchange rates.

Perhaps you could take up this argument with Satoshidice.

Get an account with coinbase if you're in the US and just buy them.  That's what I do. 
I haven't tried localbitcoins.com yet but I hear good things about it.
You just have to spend a bit more time moving money to bitcoin for the time being.

Bitcoin cannot be used for fractional banking because no one can create new bitcoins.   They can only be mined.

Gold increased a lot more in value when people found out about it.

There is a tendency to hoard/save bitcoin because they go up in value. 
That is fine, but the community MUST spend as well to create the market for your hoarding to go up in value.  :)
This is why you hoard with one account and instead of spending dollars as usual on everything, buy bitcoins to spend them in the new bitcoin marketplaces.

Great idea!  Green address...damn...hadn't heard of it.  Sounds like this is already covered in the community.  I'll kindly STFU and leave.

Bitcoins aren't always easy to get.  Real easy to move around once you get them but getting something valuable can always be difficult.
@_date: 2013-05-23 12:31:47
Damn...that sounds FUN!  Anyone?

Bitcoin will be worth 10k this time next year.

I've done it.  You do.  Think Walmart or anything around 100 bucks.  Nobody is going to accept that without confirmations.

I can't tell you if it's a scam or not but it is EXACTLY what the fuck the bitcoin community needs.
@_date: 2013-05-18 14:49:39
Create one address to save/invest and others to use as ordinary checking accounts and spend those freely at places that accept bitcoin.  Actively look for them.  If you're going to buy a computer, buy one with a Gyft card funded with bitcoin or at a location that accepts bitcoin directly.
Leave your investment/savings address(es) untouched.

Why not just use bitcoin?

Virus...this guy is trying to steal bitcoins.  We need to find out WHO he is and get his ass.

Bitcoin has inherent value because of the blockchain imo.  Currency gets it's value from the goods and services it is traded for and the quantities.  Each "storefront" will have public addresses that money will be sent to.  We know roughly the average cost of items at these storefronts such as hat stores, shoe stores, Tesla, etc and can determine the worth of bitcoin based on how much is spent at these stores.  For instance, clearly bitcoin had inherent value of 10,000 bitcoins for one pizza at one time.
Now, 1 bitcoin can buy many pizzas and only a complete fool would pay 10,000 bitcoins for 1 pizza.  
tl;dr The blockchain gives bitcoin value based on average value of public stores and goods.

Best thing for the blockchain imo is snapshots.  So, once it gets to a certain size, the blockchain goes to nothing except the current addresses holding bitcoins.  
A percentage of machines running bitcoin will keep copies of the original blockchain at that point in time decided by factors like harddrive space, time running, connection speed etc,.  The blockchain can even be stored on central public locations.  Everyone else will get the fresh blockchain with only the addresses having balances in them AND a hash of the original blockchain snapshot so it can be verified.

Any advertisement is good!  Talking to people, they will say hey, I heard of that before.  They'll talk to someone, etc., etc.  
Soon the whole world will be talking and we all need to talk more. I mean I like talking and I could go on and on and talk forever about talking.  It's something I like to talk ab.....
