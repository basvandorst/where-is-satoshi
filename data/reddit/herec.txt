Yeah, but the blockchain is continually growing, so a smaller block size is no solution at all. 
At work, if a server runs out of disk space because it filled up with log files, if someone tells me they fixed it by "cutting the amount of logging in half" they have not fixed anything because they will *still* run out of space, just maybe a bit later. Same deal with the blockchain. It only ever gets bigger, so these fixes are bandaids at best.

While on a level I agree, I think we're kidding ourselves if we think Bitcoin will escape all regulation. That being the case, I think it is in our interest to enumerate the costs and problems associated with the various regulatory directions and make sure regulators are aware of the babies in the bathwater.
I for one, would like to be able to use a non-shady, US-based exchange that I could be confident can't "pull a Gox" without going to jail. And I'd like to be a part of giving Ben food for thought that he and other regulators can use to justify why they aren't regulating Bitcoin more strictly. Keep in mind that we are still shaking off the drugs and hitmen silk-road stigma. If we want to avoid regulation, we should intelligently make our case, in my opinion.

You have this strange view where a currency is subject to guilt-by-association of the exchanges it is traded on. Somehow this property of guilt by association applies only to bitcoin, though. You somehow *don't* think this magical guilt by association (and lack of trust) applies to the dollar and pyramid schemes and Bernie Madoff--as you provide no rebuttal. I think people are smart enough to distinguish a bank from the dollar, or a Bitcoin exchange from Bitcoin itself. And frankly, when you get questioned on this belief, you turn to insults.
People won't take big risks with their livelihood for uncertain payoffs. I also think organizations (political or otherwise) can be set up so that if there's no one with the authority, responsibility, or directive to do something, it won't get done. For example, try and get someone at a restaurant to tell you their "security policy" or "recruiting strategy." You will get weird looks because no one has that job. Bureacracies limit creativity because job titles have specific areas of scope.

I'm a software engineer--the phrase "single point of failure" comes from the idea of how to build robust systems. Systems that can be brought down by failure or sabotage in a single part are inherently frail.
Trust *is* a function of time. I was around when the internet was getting big. No one trusted it at first. People thought the internet was just for perverts and murderers. 
The issue isn't just clean slate--people have had 5 years to try and hack bitcoin, with a billion dollar prize on the table in recent years. It's still standing. I think the exchange issue has no bearing on trust. There's been thousands of banks that went bust, Bernie Madoff, Ponzi schemes, and more yet people still trust dollars. State-sponsored efforts are just plain-old unlikely. Politically, if it goes wrong, it would be a career destroyer. Technologically, we can look at Healthcare.gov for how this might turn out. Even so, the responsibilities of the various branches of the government and the talents of who works there line up in such a way that there is no likely place in the government filled with politically adventurous technocrats who could sponsor this program and make it real, and no person who holds a position of power gets anything more than risking what power they already out of giving this a go.
My bank has blocked me from getting my own money because they thought buying a plane ticket was too unusual for me. I'd rather do without that meddling. It is either my money to spend, or it isn't.

1) Same was true for the internet. Trust is a function of time. No cryptocurrency will have an earlier birth date than Bitcoin. Ever. The more days we see the sun rise and set, the more confident we are that it will come up tomorrow. 
A single crypto-sponsor is a single point of failure. The whole allure of Bitcoin is that it avoids this trust problem. 
2) We'll have to agree to disagree here. Because I think the *exact* same effect applies to Bitcoin, only to an even greater extent. It isn't only first mover advantage--it is the network effect, and Bitcoin has the largest network effect. To put a finer point on it 
You can't set up a new e-Bay because who would sell with no buyers, and who would buy with no sellers?
You can't set up a new Bitcoin because who would sell with no buyers, and who would buy with no sellers?
Not to say no alt currency will ever get traction at all, but it just will be 10x smaller because of this advantage, and it had better bring something new to the table. (like Ethereum does).
New cryptocurrencies are like empty bars. No one goes to an empty bar, so it remains an empty bar. Bitcoin has a network effect with more degrees of lock-in than any website. You need holders of the currency to make accepting it worthwhile, you need places to spend it to make holding it worthwhile, you need developers actively working on it to keep it alive and they need to be the top-notch developers to make sure it is trustworthy and it doesn't fall behind. You need the most developer eyes looking at the code to make sure it doesn't have vulnerability. You need the most miners and expensive mining hardware to make sure there is maximal cost involved to prevent a 51% attack. You need VC investment to make the technology user-friendly.

You're right about the process, but I also think the whales who are most interested in bulk-buying will probably have enough cash to take all the lots. I predict all lots going to a single highest bidder. That bidder will be whoever estimates the highest runup associated with a market buy of the same size, and who also has no, or only higher-priced off-market buying opportunities. 
If a bidder doesn't have enough to bid on all lots and is still bidding, they are probably in the "confused about how this will work work out and think they will get a discount" category which means they won't have a winning bid and we'll never hear about them. That's my take.
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:14:58
Mining still makes sense and is the most profitable alternative if you are either money laundering or converting out of a controlled currency.  
Don't get me wrong, plenty of stupid miners out there. But if I needed to get my money out of china, I might run a large mining operation. 
If you think about this as an arms race, mining will always be driven to be unprofitable by those for whom it can be "unprofitable" and still be the least unprofitable alternative. Sort of like how most restaurants lose money. If you see a restaurant last more than 10 years without a lot of patrons, it is probably a front. And if you are trying to compete, you have to compete with people willing to take a loss because for them the restaurant is a way to convert drug money into legal but fictional "restaurant profits" that they can spend without raising eyebrows.
Mining lets you convert cash to bitcoin with no paper trail.

Bitcoin will have higher trust because it has been around longer.
On open source projects, me-to projects get almost none of the developer attention.

I think we are phenomenally lucky...  
The first regulator tackling this is not some 60 year old who thinks Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme for buying drugs that should be criminalized. Instead we have someone who sees the point, and the benefits, and is trying not to squash it, and even wants their state to attract the exchanges for it. Like it or not, regulation, is a form of tacit acceptance--it removes the "will they outlaw it" possibilities from our risks.  And yes, outlawing it wouldn't "destroy it" but it would cripple it if merchants can't accept it. I think in this AMA, the recurring theme needs to be "but you can do that with cash, which we don't regulate"

A better way to think of it is that most miners have already pre-paid for their bitcoins using fiat (by purchasing mining equipment).

I actually thought you had a good point about centralization, but your social skills are preventing you from presenting the information in a way that will win anyone to your cause. Your time spent here is wasted unless you work on them.
On the same token, core devs don't seem to understand social skills like "tit for tat" in negotiations and reciprocity. It doesn't matter if you bluster on and on about how it is an increase. To close a deal, each party needs to feel like it is giving something, and getting something. I, and many others, are suggesting a simple compromise other than BU that might pass and avoid the BU outcome. 
I guarantee that someone with a better understanding of people than you or core, could land us in a happy world with segwit and core still in control. I have my doubts that this will happen.

Even moreso, if I was a miner, I imagine I'd be mad at leaders attempting to cut me out and make my investment worthless, and even if I were not, just sheer self interest would compel me to try to put *any* other devs in charge, regardless of skill or snafus.

If other countries do not care about blacklisting, you could theoretically bounce into any fiat, and buy new clean coins...  Seems like there'd be a discount on red coins though.

In the near-term, there's an instant and massive PR windfall for the first few major companies to accept bitcoin. 
In the longer term, you have no chargeback risk and lower processing fees by about 1.5%. That goes straight to the bottom line! That's huge!!! And chargebacks are a major issue for many retailers, so especially high-chargeback risk purchases make this a no-brainer. The average chargeback rate is 1%, so that's again, another 1% straight to the bottom line.  It really makes sense for any business--what business would *not* like to add 2.5% percent to their bottom line on every sale?
Especially any business in one of these high chargeback risk industries should REALLY think about it:
Adult Websites
Collection Agencies
Credit Repair
Debt Collection
Global Charities
Health / Herbal Supplements
Inbound Telemarketing
Online Dating
Online Hotel Reservations
Online Niche Foods
Online Pharmacies
Online Shopping Malls
Outbound Telemarketing

Doing this is a great way to know yourself. If you like to go to sleep at night knowing you are a decent person, you might transfer out 1337 (leet in hacker speak) satoshis, then transfer them back to let the person know their wallet has been cracked.
If you have no soul, just do whatever.

Hey, sorry for the slow response. Your comment was good and got me thinking.  When I see a solid line of reasoning, if only for myself, I like to figure if/why I agree or disagree.
I think in order for bitcoin to succeed as a currency, it must first be a store of value. Yes, a fluctuating store of value makes people nervous, but, many people can read the handwriting on the wall.
There has never been a worldwide, instantly transferrable currency with no 3rd party risk, that weighs nothing, and has almost no transaction fee, and is also not deflationary. If many people see the promise, even if it is a bumpy ride, they reason that others will also see the promise, which leads to the conclusion it will grow overall and be a good store of value.
In order for the payment use-case to work, a currency needs to first have a substantial store of value behind it. What good is a currency no one holds, that is valued at nothing?
So, I suppose my argument is that, rather than speculation, the run up is an acknowledgement that this is a good, maybe the best, way to store value. And if that is the case, many people, all at once, are moving their money into BTC. Maybe this is semantics, but is it speculation if you don't plan on selling and cashing it out, nearly ever? That seems more like a store of value scenario to me.
Anyhow, great response, and thanks for making me think!

The benefit is there for some use-cases. 
1-If you are in a high  fraud country, bitcoin would provide a way to pay sites that otherwise would not accept your purchase for fear of charge-back. When I was selling software online, for example, I did not accept sales from places other than mainly the us and europe and a few rich countries because the chances it would result in a chargeback (chargeback fee was 15 bucks--about the price of the software) were so high it was never profitable to sell to them. Also they were a tiny percentage of sales, so I had no incentive. Bitcoin, on the other hand, would make sense to accept from those other countries because it has no chargeback risk. Paypal has the same chargeback issues.
2-Many merchants offer discounts for cash. In a similar way with Bitcoin, if they pass part of the discount on to end-users, it would be in your interest.
3-If you don't have a bank account or credit card, you can still transact online with bitcoin if you can buy some (getting the BTC is still the hard part here, but I think this will get better). You can't do this with Paypal as far as I know.
4-Paypal freezes money when in doubt. So if you are paying for something/someone you are passionate about (like a kickstarter for something amazing, or a wikileaks donation) you may prefer to remove the 3rd party risk where their funds could be entirely trapped.
5-If you want to buy or send more than $10,000.

With the exception of  all of those things are beneficial to miners, not the end-users. Why do I care if a CPU, GPU, or asic mined the coin?  
But  is really a trade-off, and not one I'm sure brings much to the table or that won't be handled by some other work-around in btc.

To clarify what I mean by ego-centric, I don't mean it as pejorative. I mean that when you evaluate something by strictly thinking would *I* use it, you are likely to miss the diversity of needs other people have that you don't share.
You waved off my second set of use cases, but actually, I would submit that  (porn) has driven adoption of many technologies previously. Since bitcoin solves the "worried about what shows up on my credit card" problem, as well as the high chargeback rate problem in that industry, that along could make it big.
Telecommunications Union data shows mobile phone penetration rate in Africa is 69%. Smart phones are about 18% of the phones in africa, but that rate is growing 20% year over year.

If it is successful, and the probability of this just jumped greatly via the way the senate hearings went, it is a *ridiculous* steal, even at this price. The current low price is just noise while the market figures this out.
The current "market cap" of bitcoin is so small it couldn't even be used to cover the market cap of one US company like Tesla. If this is the trans-national stateless currency of the future, the hyper growth we've seen needs to continue until this currency base covers things at-scale. Probably the gold comparisons are the closest, but they may only scratch the surface. 
Bitcoin is an all or nothing bet, and the nothing scenario just got capped in the knee in the senate. At 5% of gold, it would be 38k a coin. Why would it stop at 5% when it is more useful? Protocols (like http, tcp/ip, etc) have high switching costs, and are sticky. Bitcoin is the protocol for money exchange, and it will, by virtue of services and acceptance that are now growing, and the switching costs that are needed to change them, have a moat around it. It is a first mover with a network effect, but also a protocol (stickier than something like a social network).
Once people figure this out (and now that a lot of fear has been removed) the price will continue to skyrocket. The only thing that keeps a single bitcoin affordable is that human psychology about what price is reasonable is based on anchoring on yesterday's price, not discerning tomorrow's price. Most of these other estimates are based on anchoring, or what the person dares to hope. Hope and fear are irrelevant, only the probability of success, and size of the likely outcome matter in figuring out what a rational value for bitcoin is...
Look at the second slide:
edit: 
And people will make arguments about stability and how currency is no good unless it is stable. Stability is a property of size approaching a natural limit. It is a property that comes with size. For example it is easy to take a kiddie pool and fill or empty it (wild swings of 100% in water depth!) but doing that with an adult pool is slow, a lake nearly impossible, and an ocean, totally impossible. So this growth is a step on the way to stability.

It's not a best fit line if it starts under the line of the data it is fitting and remains under it for the entire length.  That's some kind of line, but not a best fit line.

I'm guessing that someone like you never would. 
My post was pretty clear about who would want to use it, you don't fit the categories but you still went out of your way to respond, so I'm guessing you have an axe to grind.
But for the benefit of people who don't have an axe to grind, I'd say someone who doesn't fit those categories might also use it if:
1-They prefer to hold their money in a non-inflationary vehichle. 
2-Don't want to use credit, but also don't want to pay banking fees. 
3-They have money in btc for other purposes (transferring it to a home country) so it is convenient. 
4-Want to buy something only sold in btc.
An example is micro-transactions. Some business models are now practical with micro-transactions that couldn't work otherwise. Small cheap digital goods/service.
5-Porn or other items you don't want on your account statement.

I think, buying what you can afford to lose is rational, and don't kid yourself--imagine life with that money gone and how you'll feel. The bet is asymmetrical now--risk a little for a chance at a lot. I also think assuming this will grow in the pattern of anything else is risky--it is a black swan.
I have no idea how to estimate the timeframe. Sorry. I think the senate hearings so far may have just shortened it a lot. I can talk about how anchoring isn't rational, but that won't stop the price from growing at a pace that is based on the anchoring and ratcheting up that happens with other items, though.

Multi-signature wallets and other items built in can make stealing bitcoins *more* impractical than cash. Two factor authentication across phone and a PC could be implemented with a signature needed from each place...

Also, current stakeholders have a massive incentive via their highly valued holdings not to ditch their current holdings. Essentially the crypto-currency of the future must be bitcoin because it is already in a Nash equilibrium.

And to have money, you don't need to be a person. Your refrigerator,  a parking meter, or any software program can transact now. And you can have 100's of wallets with no penalty (like a minimum balance or monthly fee on a bank account). On the internet, no one knows you're a refrigerator.
