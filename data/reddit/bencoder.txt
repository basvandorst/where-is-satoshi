And what in your description is centralised, or disagrees with it being decentralised? Decentralised does not imply anonymous. Those are two separate concepts that you seem to be conflating.

Presumably because with more competition it's now more expensive to mine, so in order to get a positive ROI, miners will have to sell the coins for a higher price.

But difficulty changes as a function of the previous blocks every 2016 blocks. 
If what you say was true, one could easily mine a chain longer than the current one by staying on the initial difficulty level, without changing the difficulty level every 2016 blocks.

Yeah it's the same. Except that in this case, MtGox were looking for the transaction hash in the blockchain. When they didn't find it they would create a new transaction, thus causing the recipient to get coins twice. It is only a problem with third party services and not with bitcoin itself, but it does mean it's quite difficult to automatically verify whether a transaction succeeded or failed. At least everyone is aware of it now :)

so you take the list of transactions + your random nonce and run them through a hashing function. This generates a new random number, you can't predict what this number will be or influnce it other than changing the input data (the random nonce).
If this new random number (the hash of the transactions + the nonce) is lower than a certain value agreed by the network (the difficulty) then your block can pass and all the others can verify that it has. Thats why you have to do this repeatedly, changing the nonce each time, hoping that the random number generated (the hash) will be lower than the difficulty. You can't just choose your own difficulty because that's decided by the network, and the network will reject blocks that are invalid.

the point is that a miner could change the transaction hash by slightly altering the signature in a way that causes the transaction hash to be different but the signature to still be valid.
This doesn't require the original spender to create different transactions with the same inputs.

We seem to have a stable period for the first few months of every year(give or take). I'm sure this is like the 4th time I've seen this article.
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:32:21
No you don't change the transanctions, you change the nonce, the random number.
so for example
    hash([transaction data] + 123456789) = 99874561 (too big)
    hash([transaction data] + 123456790) = 00012544 (small enough)
one digit difference in the input data (the transactions + the nonce) will make a big difference to the hash, that's the point of a hashing function.
Yes, the reward transaction will look different because it doesn't have any inputs, it's magicking new bitcoins out of thin air - the other clients will reject the block if it is too high.
Transaction fees and block rewards are combined together, there's nothing special about the transactions in the block, it doesn't matter what order they are put into the block. Even if the miner doesn't put any transactions into the block they can still put the transaction to themself in for the block reward (but they'd be missing out on any transaction fees, plus it's a dick thing to do) - it'd still be a valid block, and we see this sometimes.
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:42:13
A block doesn't have to contain any transactions though the first block did contain the block reward transaction. It also contained a headline from the times:


Your understanding is slightly wrong. The transactions themselves contain the signatures (produced by signing the transaction with the private keys of the inputs). 
A block is a list of all the recent transactions(and normally a special transaction to yourself, for the block reward), which are then hashed along with a random number(sometimes referred to as a nonce) to generate a new big number. 
If this new number is smaller than the target (based on difficulty) then you have created a valid block and you transmit it to the network. If not then you change the nonce and try again repeatedly until you get one that is smaller.
Hashing means running an algorithm which given an input will generate the same output, but you can't go back from the output to the original input nor predict what the output will be. This means to generate a hash below the given difficulty you have to hash the data repeatedly. It also means that it's easy for the other clients to verify that your block is valid because they can easily recalculate the hash given all the transactions plus the nonce. They can't steal it because the block reward is included in the list of transaction.

I think May 2010 I solved my first block from CPU mining.
My first transaction was in June 2010 selling some Zimbabwe notes(like 150 trillion Zimbabwe dollars or something) for about 1000 bitcoins. Which was worth about $5 back then. I sold most of them when the price shot up about 10 times and 1000 coins suddenly was worth $50. I was convinced that the 10x increase from $0.005 to $0.05/bitcoin was just a bubble and couldn't last.

I'm surprised how low the volume for bitpay is, 99 is the most they've had in a 24 hour period? I ordered a domain from microtronix a while back, using bitpay, and it was really smooth and fast. I hope bitcoin sales volume will increase.
Looks like SR really does hold the vast majority(Like, at least 99%) of bitcoin-for-goods transactions.

normally those free bitcoin sites send out in big batches to many people at once, a few times per day rather than every time someone clicks. I see it was 20 hours ago, you might have received your milli-bitcoins by now.

This doesn't place you at a high risk of being scammed - it places the bitcoin seller at a high risk of being scammed since you can reverse the payment at any point in the future. Hence why it is so hard to do.
That said, if you are just looking for small amounts, you will probably be able to find somebody - It's been a long time since I bought or sold bitcoins so I have no idea what the market is like now but I'd advise asking on the [bitcoin-otc]( channel on IRC.

Might need a place in March if a room would be available. What's the price?
@_date: 2013-01-18 14:30:59
They won't lose bitcoins, but they might have bought bitcoins at a higher price than currently, if the ACH fails.
User selects to purchase bitcoins through coinbase and initiates ACH. Coinbase purchases bitcoins through mtgox (say). User has to wait 7 days for the ACH to clear. If the price of the coins drops in that time, user can empty and cancel their account and cause the ACH to fail, therefore Coinbase has purchased the coins for the user at a higher rate than they could now sell them.

I understand that. I just think it could be taken a lot further, as the technology allows dumb/feature phones to do bi-directional communication, which is not possible to do with a QR code.
The device could act as a fully secure wallet, even without internet access, by communicating the transaction back via the POS system.
@_date: 2013-11-02 20:23:07
How is this possible? Does it asymptotically approach earning zero bitcoins(Less than 1 Satoshi?) before the break even point?
@_date: 2013-02-19 20:25:13


And ever will be mined in the future.
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:16:47
I understand that. I was just questioning how it's possible for it to not ever break even, even if electricity is free.
Even if it takes 1000 years, eventually just mining bitdust, it feels like it would have to break even at some point unless the rewards literally go to zero.
@_date: 2013-10-13 14:37:44
I'm kind of in agreement with the other commentors here. When I first read the intro, I was thinking that's a clever alternative for phones/devices that aren't NFC enabled. So the POS device chirps a payment request to the customer's device, which then creates a transaction and signs it and chirps it back and the POS device then verifies and transmits it onto the network. Thus the customer doesn't even need web access in order to pay with bitcoin.
But apparently nope, I don't understand what this is except a more annoying, probably more error-prone and awkward way of getting a bitcoin address and payment amount from a terminal/supplier to the customer.
@_date: 2013-02-24 21:36:10
No you are doing it wrong, $1-10,000 I can understand as "one to ten thousand dollars", $1-$10,000 I read as "one dollar to ten thousand dollars" which is quite different. Don't duplicate the $ if you are using this construct. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 07:50:21
Yes it will. The seed can be continuously used to generate an unlimited number of addresses (deterministically, so with the same seed, it will always generate the same set of addresses in the same order) so presumably when you recover from the seed it keeps generating them until there's a large enough run that don't contain any bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-02-05 19:31:16
Just what I was thinking. It's not Amazon accepting bitcoin like everyone wants, but if amazon coins are transferable then it could be possible to create easy services for exchanging between amz and btc.

I think he was saying they average out between countries, so the relative penetration degree between different countries is what's important, not the absolute values given. So we can say that Sweden has twice the penetration of Germany, even though they are likely to be much much lower than 0.6% and 0.3% respectively

not so trusted because it can be done as m-of-n, so the oracle cannot take the money for itself. It could still collude though which leads us back to reputation and trust, but it is less of an issue with m-of-n
