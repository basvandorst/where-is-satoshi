Unfortunately not paying the right amount of tax is a crime :(

Let me rephrase my question: How do I buy/sell large amounts without getting fucked by banks or by paying too little tax?

See you on the otherside guys. 
RemindMe! 6 months

"If you buy all at once, you become obsessed with the price &amp; follow all the fluctuations. You regret deeply every minute the price is below your buy price." I agree with this. I'll think about DCA. I might up the rate such that it will only take 1 year. Trust me, I care very much about $500,000! If I didn't care then why would I be investing it! I'd go and buy an uninsured lambo and run red lights. 
Who knows what will happen, I'll just be waiting for the next burst - its pretty easy to tell when its happening. Say we are at $3k. In 2 days we climb to $3.5k when its taken a month to climb $500 before. The media is going mad, the media will pour all over it. People will buy BTC. Then, the media will cite the burst that happened this month and exactly then it will burst. Just my theory. Or, now we are somewhat used to this level of gain. It will continue to gain at this pace for a longer time without any worry about a burst occurring because its ground we have covered before. Maybe the next burst will occur when we hit $1000 growth in 2 days!

2 years? I am trying to buy before the next inevitable media hype frenzy that will occur when BTC gets 200-300$ above its previous maximum price. The other 90% of my assets are tied up, 500k is the maximum I realistically have to hand.

Or fuck the theory and fly to the moon.

Thanks. Will take a look. I didn't mean to use such a narrow term as "schools". Any resources will do
