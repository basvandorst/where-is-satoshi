Mcafee is like Russ Hanneman in Silicon Valley.  Guy got rich by making a bad product that happened to be the first or one of the first in the marketplace.  He’s a total nutjob, and as well respected as Russ.

I’ll contribute something in case this story is actually true.  OP, remember the euphoria you felt when you realized you had 10000 coins sitting at home, at the price point of $1000?  Well, there is zero chance you wouldn’t have unloaded those for around the $10M they were worth at the time.  So that would have netted you $10 million, which would have become $7 million after federal capital gains and state taxes are paid on it in New York.  $7M is a huge windfall, but it’s not enough money to let you go live some high-rolling, epic lifestyle for the next 80 years.  
There are people who win ten times that in the Lotto all the time, who are destitute and miserable a few years later.  The less of a role people have in the acquisition of wealth, the less likely they are to value it or invest it responsibly.  Everyone knows someone who has blown a huge inheritance or insurance settlement on stupid shit.  If you didn’t have to work your ass off to earn something, it’s extremely easy to lose it to frivolity.
You are in your 20s, with your health intact, living in a country with the greatest opportunity for wealth and success.  Life can change for the better in the blink of an eye, but if you give up or kill yourself, you’ll never have a chance to live the life you feel you missed out on.

Oh yeah, I mistyped.  OP said he had 10,000 bitcoins, not 1000.  I'll correct that.

You can't possibly be serious, right?  The guy talks like that because he's an absolute imbecile, who is also clearly borderline demented.  Nearly every person who has encountered him in professional and private life has described him as an idiot, or some synonym of that notion.
Saying Trump speaks in nonsensical gobbledygook to "appeal to the average voter" is one of the most absurd apologist sentiments I've ever heard.  He talks like a toddler all the time, in speeches, in candid conversations, and in interviews.  I'd honestly be shocked if Trump had an IQ above 90.

There is a certain irony in a bunch of zero-transparency, anti-regulation, anti-government, anarchist people demanding intervention and accountability when they get personally burned.  
Next thing, you'll be asking for a federal bailout for your lost funds.
You don't get to have it both ways.

Very scientific guys, you should seriously get into the prophecy business.  I hear there is more money to be made in prophecy than in Bitcoin speculation.

So you agree with it being okay to display the ten commandments in front of a state building in Texas?  Violate the separation clause much?

Defend this creep, seriously? Do you know what he's guilty of?  I think that negotiating for the cold-blooded murder of rivals disqualifies someone from a defense rally on Reddit.
The FBI has this scumbag dead to rights negotiating murder for hire.  He sent over $700,000 to the alleged assassins.  They have him as guilty as anyone can be, with emails, transcripts, etc.
This "landmark case" only "affects us all" if you're a greedy, arrogant, murderous motherfucker like Ross Ulbricht.  Go read his Wiki or the Rolling Stone article before you give a penny to his defense.
Oh, and by the way, I'm sure that the character witness of his sister is better evidence than what the state has on him.  What a joke.

This is completely untrue, from a psychological adoption perspective.  Trying to get people to adopt something new by telling them that "you too can buy .05 of one coin for only $50" or whatever is a pretty tough sell.  Also, there is that whole insane volatility thing, something that stable currencies like the US dollar don't suffer from.  
When I sell someone my used car for $12,000, I don't have to worry that the money I received is going to be worth $6000 two days later because some exchange owner was running a Ponzi scheme.

You could do the smart and rational thing, which is unloading a falling asset and buying it again when you feel the price has bottomed out. Clutching tightly to a falling knife is not an investment strategy.

It's interesting you seem to have knowledge of some ancient period in human history predating money.  Are you a time traveler?

Because anyone can make arbitrary amounts of coins at any arbitrary price, the “market cap” of Cryptocurrencies is totally irrelevant.

Except there is nothing stopping you selling at the current price point, then rebuying when the price is substantially lower.  If you were willing to buy at $12K, you should be willing to buy much more when the price is a lot lower.  Just sitting on it is stupid, unless you simply cannot handle the psychological impact of monitoring the price.

Do you really think the handful of people on this sub and their .1 BTC average holdings have any influence on the actual price?  The price is entirely a consequence of speculative buying and selling by people who aren’t on Reddit.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:29:59
What would be the possible reason to own all your net worth in a useless “currency” with insane volatility?  BTC can’t be used for purchasing or for lending, so what value does it even have outside of speculation?  Also, the only reason 99.999% of the population gives a fuck about Bitcoin, or even knows about it, is because of its value IN US dollars.  That’s the sad irony of the tech, that it’s very worthiness is defined in the very thing it’s meant to untether from.

I knew Roger when he was a spazzy 16-year old playing mono red Magic decks at Neutral Ground in Mountain View, California.  He was just as obnoxious then as he is now, just less arrogant and less emboldened.  He is most assuredly not a robot, a robot could have played better Magic.

Haha, as if these clowns have any clue how to build anything.  This boondoggle will be Fyre Festival 2.0.  How long until the locals swoop in and snatch them up for ransoms.  Much of Puerto Rico doesn’t even have power still, much less the infrastructure to afford comfort to a bunch of lucky crypto early adopters.  Isn’t Bitcoin supposed to be the exact opposite of this: a bunch of rich elitists walling themselves off from the rest of squalid humanity with their dollars?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:48:47
Why hold?  That’s not an investment strategy, just sell this falling asset and buy back in when it’s much cheaper.  You could wind up with 5 x as much holdings when the price recovers.

Quite curious to hear what all the Ross defenders have to say about these two things:
[  
Opinion of US Court of Appeals denying Ulbricht's retrial request
It really seems the guy was guilty of a LOT of dirty shit.  There was overwhelming evidence he paid for numerous contract killings (which didn't actually occur fortunately), as well as facilitating the sale of hundreds of millions in illegal drugs.  I don't agree with the life sentence for the drug stuff at all, but it seems like he was mad with power, and completely lacked any moral compass.  While he wasn't actually tried for the murder for hire stuff, it was a huge factor in his sentencing.  I don't understand why Ross is so lionized, it seems like he was just a scumbag out for personal profit and gain.
