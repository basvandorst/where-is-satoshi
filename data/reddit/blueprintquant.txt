Imagine BTC Wikipedia in 2025: "BTC, formally known as Bitcoin, is a ect..."
"Bitcoin was changed to BTC in 2021 to eliminate confusion/ misinformation of the currency ect..."

Because if you cost average BTC when it drops, then you make money overtime.
Investors sell 50%-80% of portfolio on Q4 of profitable years, so probably 2021 next.

BTC ATM's in every city
BTC billboards. Example: "Buy BTC, the best performing digital asset class of all time!"
It's just better marketing in general

The word Bitcoin simply doesn't have effective marketing. If we want professional investors and new users and adoption to gain, we have to Market Btc better. 
Most effective solution? Change Bitcoins source name. Pay every freelance writer you can get in touch with to write about the change. Same with news media. ***Just that by itself*** would boost Btc coverage globally and  cause a Black Swan effect. Trust me it will work. The name Bitcoin had a great 10 year run but now its time to cause a ripple effect globally.

When you tell people to buy bitcoin, 90% of people **actually** think that you are telling them to buy a physical coin. Trust me, this is how unaware society is. All i'm asking is for the change of bitcoin's name so that there is more awareness and adoption. 
..... fuk it, we should just %100 rename Bitcoin to Satoshi. lol (serious)

It would cause the opposite of confusion and it would drive more media coverage and new investors also. 
The only thing confusing is the sheer irony of naming the best performing digital money a "coin". 
60% of the Bitcoin nodes would have to agree with this change anyways.
Allow me to ask... do the btc mining pools receive coins or units? Units. 
In 2009, Bitcoin should of been named BitGold or Bitcore or Bitcollect or Bitcyber or Crypto

Temporary price drop = Good
Low volume for over 6 months = Not Good
The price is drop and the volume is high = Double good
Btc has been reaching record high trading volumes for the past 3 years. We are in the green

1. Billionaires can pay for Btc media coverage ( CEO's that market Btc)
2. Btc media coverage will happen if Btc drops below $3k or increases above $15k
