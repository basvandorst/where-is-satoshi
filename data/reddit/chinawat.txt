Here's documentation about how version is included in blocks:  
@_date: 2015-06-02 17:52:55
This is impossible because it is by definition why a hard fork diverges. Transactions that are acceptable and that can be mined on one of the post-fork chains will be considered invalid on the other chain. Any blocks mined post-fork on one chain would be considered invalid by nodes on the other fork.

I see your point. Since this is a hard fork, I'm assuming that there will be version information used after the block representing the initial chain divergence. If version information is ignored on all "Hearncoin" clients, your scenario would represent a problem, but personally I'd never support a hard fork that lacked this crucial check. In fact, I believe this version information gets incorporated into the hash of valid blocks, so it seems this is something that was planned for since the inception of Bitcoin.

I'm glad your tx confirmed. I wish I could take some credit for it, but I'm guessing it was just a coincidence. I think one or more of the 7 mempools that did have your transaction was a mining pool that had some significant hashrate (or perhaps your transaction was in some mempools not polled by BlockCypher).  
I believe re-pushing is the same as rebroadcasting. Previously I didn't realize you'd sent from Armory, but I also understand that it does rebroadcast on its own (though I don't know the time intervals).
Several things from that transaction are still mysterious to me. I don't know why it was only in 7 mempools, or why re-pushing/rebroadcasting didn't show the normal pattern of propagation across mempools in BlockCypher. Also, when I looked in on the transaction, BlockCypher listed it as "Low" under "Miner Preference", but BC.i showed its Estimated Confirmation Time as "Very Soon" (High Priority).  
As you mentioned, including a fee is never a bad thing, but I also have plenty more to learn about transaction specifics before I could explain exactly what happened in this case.

To me, an orphaned branch does not constitute a new block chain, because, as you yourself have written, the rules of the orphan block and the longest chain are the same. In a hard fork, those rules will not be the same and that's where things will diverge.

@_date: 2015-06-03 07:36:23
I agree it would be a massive change, unlikely to happen. However, if it were to come to pass, the amount of investment already in Bitcoin would jump start the hash rate on the new algorithm. If it was chosen to be CPU-only (or even GPU), the initial low difficulty would bring many back into mining. I'd jump in. Initially, security may be weak, but it would also be pretty decentralized. I would bet the the hash rate would grow very quickly.
@_date: 2015-06-18 02:44:34
Not orphan, just not accept. If the node still runs small block code, the block is still valid for that chain. But otherwise, yes, that's what seems sensible to me.

Part of my issue with "paying for debasement" is, it's not like Bitcoin has finished price discovery or knows the value of its eventual economy. So just like its money supply, that part of Bitcoin is changing as well.  
In the normal sense of debasement, you have a mature currency that has an economy size that goes along with it. You then add currency supply. If this were the case, I'd tend to agree that you can infer debasement costs everyone. But for Bitcoin, the monetary supply inflation is a one-time thing to reach a complete supply. As that is occurring, the Bitcoin economy itself is growing from nothingness. I can't guess if the system is calibrated well enough that the completion of currency issuance will coincide exactly with the maturity of the Bitcoin economy, but I do know that, right now, both process are not finished. Therefore, equating the debasement of fiat money supplies in mature economies with the new currency issuance of Bitcoin is an unequal comparison at best.

As if that was part of the plan all along.  
But my point is all competing payment processors run using mature currencies, for which this process has been settled for decades. Though if you do want to speak of transaction costs in this way, I suppose you could add fiat inflationary pressures when considering those systems. Wouldn't change the discussion much for developed countries in most eras, but it would really point out how costly such systems are in Venezuela, Argentina, etc.  
Still, I think that's expanding the definition of "transaction cost" way beyond the normal meaning of the phrase.

@_date: 2015-06-05 23:16:15
I have to disagree. It seems to me, changing the maximum block size limit is quite removed from changing any of the core "math" of Bitcoin. In my view, more consideration might have been warranted when they added the limit in the first place.  
AFAIK, all the supposed negative effects of raising the limit (with the exception of increased susceptibility to a theoretical malicious miner block size spam attack) are based on assumed dramatic increases in the the actual block size following such a change. Any such assumption seems wholly unjustified and entirely speculative.  
As far as *how* the block size limit should be raised, I'm quite open to all proposals. Yours seems reasonable, but I'd like to first entertain possible criticisms of it and others before deciding which to back.

@_date: 2015-06-20 14:19:28
It's actually both. That the total number of bitcoins [will never exceed 21 million]( is something that is a fundamental part of the Bitcoin protocol. The rules of the protocol are such only because a consensus Bitcoin users agree to them (by using code that include those rules). As such, it's exceedingly unlikely that the 21 million unit limit will ever be increased because Bitcoin users would be unlikely to voluntarily make their holdings worth less.  
Loss of bitcoin is something that will always occur, and as you've pointed out the reduction of total supply will tend to make remaining bitcoins more valuable. This is why Bitcoin is considered *deflationary*.  
Of course, someone could try to increase the value of their own holdings by bumping off other holders, but bitcoins are useless to those that are imprisoned for life or worse.

Good idea. As other redditors have already told you in their comments, selling bitcoin for PayPal is just too risky for the seller, so even if you find a way to do it, the rates are (with good reason) very high. It's unfortunate that there's no fast, easy and quick way to do what you're seeking, but that's just how it is when you're trying to acquire an irreversible asset using "funds" that are almost always reversible to one extent or another.

I can't speak for "people", but I'm not forgetting that this is possible. It's just that this has been possible even with with 32 MB blocks from the earliest days of Bitcoin, and with 1 MB blocks since they were implemented. To my knowledge, an attempt to exploit this by a malicious miner has never occurred. And just a point of correction:  


Although a malicious miner trying this attack would definitely mine the first such large or artificially filled block, there's no guarantee that the malicious miner would mine any subsequent one, even with the head start he provides for himself. More importantly, let's presume the worst that can possibly happen here does happen: a malicious private miner (not even a pool) that has a large portion of Bitcoin's total hash power decides to try to exploit this attack. We assume also that this attacker has access to the fastest CPUs to process transactions and to verify large blocks, as well as the fastest Internet access to upload and receive large blocks. He executes this attack, and continues until his advantage starts increasing his share of found blocks beyond that which his share of hashing power should normally yield. As a result, this miner starts to drive his smaller competition, those that don't have the same resources and advantages out of business.  
This is not an attack that reaps much benefit over short periods. It must be maintained for an extended time to generate significant returns. Is it reasonable to suppose that the rest of the Bitcoin community will stand by and do nothing as this happens? And while the community watches this happening, the price of bitcoin would likely suffer dramatically. I think it's clear that the community would respond by taking any necessary steps to restrict or prevent such future attacks. It would quickly bolster the argument of those for small block sizes and centralized scalability solutions. It's even possible if it angers enough of the community that support could rise for a fork to a different hashing algorithm. Any number of solutions that I can't foresee could be employed, all to the detriment of the attacker.  
So what would the malicious miner gain? Marginally higher rewards (expressed only in bitcoin units) during the attack and before the community responds. Net profit (in non-bitcoin units) is not even guaranteed unless the malicious miner tries to short bitcoin at the same time. I'd even question if exchanges would pay such a trader if it was determined they were the miner behind such actions.  
Meanwhile, the malicious miner has generated enormous uncertainty for his future revenues and garnered the anger of the entire Bitcoin community. If the same miner simply continued with his/her normal business, they'd have guaranteed returns, far less uncertainty, and wouldn't need to fear any pitchfork brigade or possible criminal/civil repercussions.  
Based on this line of reasoning, I've recently wondered what would have happened if the maximum block size limit was completely removed early on. It's possible I'm missing something, but I doubt much bad would have come from it.

It's possible, but I highly doubt it. Such an action would not only dilute per unit value by increasing money supply, but I believe it also would depress the value of Bitcoin's entire market capitalization, since the system would become viewed as less valuable. It very likely would end up losing miners' value, so why risk a known amount of profit? In any case, miners alone cannot form the economic consensus to ensure a successful hard fork.

While I agree that holdings in both chains represent hedges of the other, I have to disagree that the possibility of success or failure of the two forks must simply sum to 1. Actually, it's quite possible, however unlikely, for both forks to fail or for both to succeed in the long run.  
Wallets already exist that can hold several different cryptocurrencies, so there's no reason you can't make a wallet that "holds" the balances for each of this fork's block chains. However, in this case I think doing so would be very bad practice simply because of the confusion that could be generated.  
EDIT: changed a word

So you get all current small block Bitcoin users to update their code just to spoof the version number? This is realistic to you?

Correct me if I'm wrong here, but this is only if we get full 20 MB blocks overnight, right? It'll be different if it starts to happen years down the road when infrastructure should be much improved.
@_date: 2015-06-05 18:51:36
Their bandwidth concerns are largely (only?) with respect to how it could raise their orphan rate. Even with a 20 MB cap (or heck, even with no cap at all) block sizes will only increase organically with the growth of Bitcoin adoption (barring a malicious miner spam attack which has never happened to my knowledge). How did miners ever get the idea that the 1 MB cap would never change, or that their costs or operations would not need to stay updated?  


That's fine, and that's why I said they'll be free to mine 1 MB bitcoin (or less even) as long as they like. If too many stay on 1 MB bitcoin, the only issue I can see is the possibility of major block time delays until the next difficult adjustment, which is why I'd be supportive of a difficulty reset or change of difficulty adjustment algorithm if it looks like major miners won't be on-board with any change right away.

But each such transfer may take several business days to complete on the conventional US banking system.  
Also note, these services require sign-up and verification, so if you haven't already done these things the whole process may take many more days (sign-up and verification are one-time processes, so subsequent trades will be much faster). Pretty sure the minimum buy amount is $10 on Coinbase, not sure if there's a minimum at Circle.

There's no way to prevent a sufficiently wealthy and powerful opponent from attacking Bitcoin (or for that matter, anything else in this world) in any number of ways. Trying to make Bitcoin impervious to all possible economically irrational attacks is a fool's errand. We do the best we can, and continue to to align incentives against bad behavior. In this specific case, there might already be enough disincentives against a spam large block miner attack that a block size limit is not even required, so it's hard to imagine raising the 1 MB limit to 20 MB, or even somewhat beyond would be a problem.  
But even if I'm wrong, it doesn't follow that such an attack would cause Bitcoin to fail or to irreparably damage its reputation. Any setback would be temporary. If no other solution is employed in that scenario, the Bitcoin community could simply fork back to 1 MB blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-03 23:08:31

Exactly. No block can be valid unless the hash from the previous block is. This is all that is necessary to differentiate the two block chains in this hard fork. From that point on it will be "the chain with the most work *that's valid in that fork*."  
It does not matter if miners switch or not, they can choose to mine on any SHA256 chain they like, but if it's not the one agreed upon by supporters of a larger block size, it's entirely irrelevant to the larger block contingent.

FBI responsibility over the case would mean a federal charge, but murder-for-hire is a state crime. Is the Maryland indictment still being brought? Do you have a link?

And I actually believe all the federal charges are the ones that have just concluded in this trial.  


In the United States you are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. Using implied, possibly unindicted, and definitely unconvicted charges as a reason to affect sentencing (or really for any such prejudicial reason) is, in my opinion, highly improper -- just another example of the lack of even-handedness in this prosecution.  
As it is, you have a man convicted of entirely non-violent crimes sentenced to life in prison. Any one of the six potential murder-for-hire charges is far more serious. If the criminal cases could stand up to the state's implications, why not convict Ulbricht of the weightier charges? Instead, unless someone can show otherwise, all these charges have apparently been dropped.  
I seriously question that it was ever proven there was only one person acting and communicating as DPR, and whether Ulbricht was definitively the person communicating in any specific messages (save potentially the ones he sent in response to the informant when he was actually arrested, and chain of evidence may have even put these in doubt if the defense had been allowed to examine the issue at trial).

1. True, but since we are still in the bootstrap phase of introducing more of this new currency, the total mining reward can be seen as currently subsidized. As halvings continue, this situation gets progressively reduced. Other variables (hashes per watt efficiency improvements, total hash rate, and difficulty) are hardly irrelevant depending on the subject of discussion.  
1. Energy consumption is not locked to the valuation of bitcoin because energy itself has a free-floating price.  
1. "Deflation has the very tangible and significant impact in the form of the value of total energy consumed by the bitcoin network." Unless you specify some kind of possible negative outcome here, I fail to see why it is worthy of concern.  
1. "All the arguments I've seen justifying the energy cost of the bitcoin network are nonsense." To the contrary, all the estimates I've seen have been conservative  if anything, and yet the conclusions are still quite clear. Considering what bitcoin is capable of replacing, it is vastly more efficient than conventional systems with all of their material, human, and energy requirements. If you disagree, please show your work. Do not confuse what miners *voluntarily expend now* with the cost of the network after future halvings. I would wager that the FDIC reports you quote are only listing the *marginal energy costs* when giving per transaction results. Let's see the same numbers when they factor in investment, infrastructure, salaries, profit, energy, depreciation, and ongoing costs to support infrastructure.  
1. You repeat a blatant fallacy. No bitcoin user pays $6 a transaction. **Miners mine by choice.**  
1. Securing the network and performing a vital part of completing transactions is hardly "no reason".

If you can convince the community that it's as secure and as decentralized as PoW (in short, that it's as good or better), Bitcoin could fork to it. Personally, I'm pretty convinced of the opposite at this point.

You can't really double-spend in the normal sense of the phrase. After the fork, your coins have really split into two different coins. You can spend each normally on each one's fork. Of course, the value of the two different coins will be very different.  
My guess is that after the fork, one coin will be nearly useless (as in, not many places to transact with it) and it's value will drop tremendously (if not go straight to zero).  
EDIT: Spelling, add second paragraph.

Only if they *all* (by that I mean all the individual miners in the constituent pools) agree to version spoof at the same, something that can only be seen as an attack on the large block camp. If the hashrate of the two camps is of the same order of magnitude, assuming enough unity can be maintained to carry out this underhanded tactic for a long period of time seems unrealistic.  
That miners can switch which fork they mine on is a good thing. They'll likely follow profitability, so whichever fork demonstrates more value in the market will attract more miners. Even if that ends up being the small block fork, at least the hard fork will have demonstrated that's where true *market* consensus is.

I realized I did not respond to the part of your question about hedging in my other comment.  
If after a fork, you only use your coins on one of the two block chains *you will automatically have a hedge in the unused coins on the other block chain*. So if it turns out the economy of the fork you start using is the wrong one, and it starts to lose to the other fork, your unused coins will just be gaining in value.  
It seems to me the only way this hedge could be completely lost is if you immediately exchanged all your bitcoin on one fork for the incompatible bitcoin on the other fork, and then it turns out you bet on the wrong fork to begin with. This would only be possible if an exchange were to offer that trading capability very soon after after the fork occurred.

He could not, because the value of the unit had to grow organically, through people's dawning recognition that it's truly a scarce asset. Dumping them all at once also does not mirror how money supplies have come into existence historically. And lastly, there's the issue of distribution of the new currency. Creating them all at once and then trying to distribute them leads to centralized systems like Ripple. Mining is also a method to distribute the units to an economy in a decentralized way.
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:51:19
You definitely could do it that way, but I think it would be more accurate to consider what coins in each fork are worth, and how much the recipient may or may not value them.  
For instance, the recipient may be a believer in one fork but expect the other to go down in value. In that case he'd just want a little more in coins from just the fork he believes in.  
It would be just like if today Alice has both bitcoin *and* litecoin. She could pay Bob for the book by sending an amount of bitcoin and of litecoin that together add up to the value of the book, or she could just pay with more of one or the other coin alone. If Bob is a merchant, he may only accept either bitcoin or litecoin, in which case the decision is made for you.

I'm not sure what you're asking, but if there is a version check in all large block clients after the hard fork, subsequent blocks [will all contain a version number that represents the updated code or newer]( Therefore any attempts to orphan a valid large block with complaint small blocks would need to spoof this version number, something that would become pretty obvious if they all remain under 1 MB.
@_date: 2015-06-08 01:28:02
You can easily see in general how BlockCypher's Confidence meter works by picking any new unconfirmed transaction and clicking the "i" icon for more information. You'll see that they check hundreds of nodes to watch the propagation of the transaction across mempools.  
I don't claim to know the exact details of how they calculate the percentage, but I would hope that miner nodes are among the ones they monitor, and that they are perhaps even given extra weight.  
If anyone can demonstrate that this meter is easily circumvented by sending a transaction directly to one or more large miners' nodes, please create a small video as you do so to demonstrate. I'm sure many here, myself included, would be very interested. Perhaps you can enlist in your efforts.

No, because that is *by definition* the nature of a hard fork. Transactions on the block chain of one fork are no longer considered valid on the other.  
EDIT: grammar
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:08:38
Not clear on what you mean here. As said, after the fork, your pre-fork coins will have split into two sets of the same amounts of the different coins. From that point on, each can be transacted on its own fork, but they do not switch to other forks unless you go through an exchange (just like between Bitcoin and Litecoin right now, and if one fork is nearly unsupported, such an exchange may never exist). Transactions in each coin stay on their own fork and do not affect the other (including amounts going to change addresses).  
If there is significant support of one fork over the other, the value of the less supported fork's coins will drop dramatically and rapidly.
@_date: 2015-06-08 06:03:01
But even in the case of orphans, legitimate transactions are simply re-sent, or revert to the mempool and get included in a subsequent block. Just because an orphan occurs doesn't automatically mean payment disaster.

Miners only represent one part of the overall system the provides functionality and hence value in Bitcoin. Non-mining nodes, merchants, SPV wallets, off-chain service providers, and parties that own bitcoin represent the other parts. Should a large majority of miners decide to hard fork to increase miner rewards, those that object to this move could simply stay on the original fork. From this point forward, the vast majority of SHA256 hashing power that is now on the miners' increased rewards fork would only affect policy there. Only the remaining hashing power on the original fork would have any say as to what happens with "original" Bitcoin. From there on, the free market would decide which fork is more valuable.

A spoofed version number could be used to disrupt the chain with lesser hashing power, but it would be probabilistic and also widely recognized as an attack (there's no legitimate reason to do it). I can only see that this would be a problem if the small block chain has *vastly* more hashing power *and* everyone contributing to that power agrees to attack. In such a case, the large block chain doesn't have anything near consensus to begin with. Otherwise, if the two camps have hash power of relatively the same magnitude, once enough blocks get built on top of a large block with the correct version, orphaning is no longer an issue. As a probabilistic process, this would simply be a matter of time. Also, it's assuming widespread doomsday mentality to think that version spoofers can keep unified intent among their individual miners to maintain such an orphaning war.
@_date: 2015-06-03 23:52:58
I think the answer is yes, but only if you can get the higher fee re-broadcast into mempools. Most will reject the higher fee re-broadcast because it would have the same UTXOs as one already received previously.

This doesn't add to PoS being "unsafe", but it's another reason I think it's an inferior solution: in attempt to correct inherent deficiencies in PoS, most schemes I've seen try to add complexity (DPoS, etc.) Every one of these corrections I've seen also detracts from the system's overall decentralization.

I think you mean a large proportion of small-block Bitcoin users would have to change to customized code in order to be able to spoof attack. Naturally all those that want large blocks already must upgrade to code with a raised block limit, otherwise there would be no fork to begin with.  


Well that's where you and I differ. I don't think it's realistic that most parties in either camp will choose to go to war. To begin with, that doesn't preserve value, it destroys it, at least in the immediate short run. In addition, attacking has costs, both practical and opportunity. For advocates of either camp, why not just use your system, continue making your profit and see where the market takes things?

I'm not an expert, but it looks like there's something wrong with your raw transaction. [BlockCypher]( is currently showing only 7 mempools have your transaction (to see this, click the small "i" icon next to the Confidence meter):  
  
A normal transaction is rapidly seen by six to eight hundred mempools. I went ahead and tried re-pushing your transaction and got no errors in my attempt, but still only 7 mempools have your transaction. This seems to indicate that most nodes on the network are not accepting your transaction for some reason.  
Check your work when you created the transaction. If you find the problem and correct it you should have no trouble issuing a double-spend, as most of the network does not have the original transaction.  
EDIT: added where to see how many mempools have the transaction at BlockCypher, and fixed a typo

If you're referring to a self-imposed soft limit, this will always be true. If you mean vetoing a hard forked hard limit, they can keep their 60% on the existing network while the rest of the network migrates to a larger limit that gives more value, and where new miners will step in enjoying the resulting lowered difficulty.

No worries, I don't think you're trying to be an ass. I think it's important to discuss all these aspects openly.  
It's no question it would be a shock to any exchange that didn't plan well ahead of such a fork, but I doubt it would cause *every* exchange to go under. You must remember, at any point even after the fork, the exchange could make both types of coin available to their users.
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:40:09
Since its beginning, Bitcoin has been many things to many people, but I think you won't find many that argue its primary purpose is to create and sustain a miner economy. In fact, I believe the opposite sentiment would be far more prevalent.  
Your position again disproportionately assigns importance to the opinions of miners. If Bitcoin is to continue to evolve in order to offer its core functions as a digital asset (in itself and as customized colored coins), a payment network, a platform for smart contracts, and as an open platform for innovation to more of the world's population, it must continue to grow and change. Miner's will need to expect to do the same.
@_date: 2015-06-02 17:46:46
Before the fork you only have bitcoins. After the fork, you'll have bitcoin-A and bitcoin-B (the same amount of units in each as you had before in just bitcoin -- so you can think of each satoshi as having split or diverged). From that point on, you'll only be able to use bitcoin-A on the fork for bitcoin-A, and bitcoin-B on the fork for bitcoin-B.  
There would be no need to "double spend" anything (which is actually an incorrect usage of the term "double spend"). If you want to buy something with bitcoin-A, simply send your bitcoin-A to a merchant that accepts bitcoin-A using a bitcoin-A wallet. You can't send bitcoin-A directly to a bitcoin-B wallet, or vice versa.  
Another way to look at it would be that all the private keys and addresses are the same for both bitcoin-A and bitcoin-B, even after the fork. What will have changed is the block chain (the ledger) for each coin, and that's how bitcoin-A and bitcoin-B can never get confused.  
Theoretically, bitcoin-A *can* get exchanged for bitcoin-B, but you'd need to go through a cryptocurrency exchange that supports such a trading pair, since the values for bitcoin-A and bitcoin-B will almost certainly be different immediately after the fork, and those values will continually change against the other. It'd just be like trading bitcoin right now for litecoin or dogecoin.  


After the fork, there will be no such thing as a "common chain". Blocks mined on the bitcoin-A fork that are accepted by bitcoin-A nodes would get rejected by bitcoin-B nodes, and vice versa. For example, at any time after the fork, if you feed bitcoin-B block chain data to a bitcoin-A node, it would immediately fail to confirm any blocks starting from the point where the fork began.  
How colored coins behave would depend on how each colored coin implementation approaches the issue, but I'd be shocked if any implementation would choose an approach that would allow confusion between colored coins on each of the post-fork block chains.  
EDIT: clarified that different block chains means different ledgers for bitcoin-A and bitcoin-B

My concerns about framing miners' response to Gavin's proposal as 'rejection' are actually several, but your update definitely addresses one of the main ones.  
I'll just mention one other primary concern: it seems there may be a significant perception that miners have a key or out-sized role in whether any hard fork proposal is viable. Saying that they "reject" any community-proposed action reinforces this impression, whereas I believe this is largely untrue. I've even seen comments reflecting the belief that "51%" or some other amount of wide miner consensus would be required. The truth is all elements of the Bitcoin community will decide on the success of a branch after a hard fork. Even in an extreme scenario of say 90% of miners supporting one branch, if the rest of the community supports the other (merchants, end-users -- essentially those that hold much of the value in Bitcoin or make it useful), the branch having far less hashing power may still end up succeeding. It's overall security would be dramatically weakened initially, but realistically, because miners have the majority of hashing power does not mean they would necessarily attack the competing branch to the detriment the entire Bitcoin community, their own finances, and to their own reputation and legal standing (not to mention that the vast majority of mining power is still concentrated in pools composed of individual miners). Whichever branch of the fork proves to be more valuable and economically viable will eventually garner miners, as it will be the one more profitable to mine on (regardless of which branch most miners had initially supported).  
While it is clearly newsworthy to report on the concerns being put forth by mining organizations, giving the impression that miners could, on their own, reject changes backed by the community as a whole serves only to misinform your readers.
@_date: 2015-06-18 14:43:02


Here it sounds like you're referring to mining, but you should understand that mining is not required for people to use Bitcoin. In fact, it's now exceedingly difficult for individuals to mine profitably.  
These days getting and using bitcoin the digital asset is the same as getting and using cash. You can exchange another form of currency for it, or you can provide goods or services for it.


If by this you mean that using Bitcoin entails connecting to some central organization, computer, or service, that's not the case. Using Bitcoin means utilizing a decentralized network. The user can choose how much they want to participate in the network (more participation means more decentralized use), but using Bitcoin directly means never being *required* to depend on any centralized agency.  


also There's a huge campaign/Lobby that supports Bitcoin which to give it some value to show like it is precious thing(claim it's precious until it is actually precious)  




Whether bitcoin is precious or not is in the eye of the beholder. What the algorithm guarantees for as long as Bitcoin exists is true and verifiable *scarcity*.  
I'd dispute that there's a huge campaign or lobby for Bitcoin. Bitcoin and its community are still tiny in the overall scheme of things. There's really no PR budget for it to speak of. However, large organizations are starting to realize the platform for innovation that Bitcoin represents. Venture capital is entering the space at an accelerating rate. The small community that does exist around it is generally composed of people that really believe in it and so are ardent activists. The combination of these factors seems to be finally raising Bitcoin's profile.  


This is actually a big subject. The advantages you've touched on so far are only part of Bitcoin's primary function as a digital asset/digital currency/store of value/payment network. You didn't mention that it's also borderless, very highly available (no banker's hours, holidays or weekends off), quite reliable, censorship and seizure resistant, highly secure (when used properly), does not expose private details through its use, potentially universal as opposed to being tied to nation-states, impossible to counterfeit/self-verifying, and can be highly transparent or virtually anonymous depending on how it's employed. It's also *programmable*.  
And that leads in to the next big advantage of Bitcoin, that it's not just limited to this first application as a digital asset/payment network. It's also the world's first method for achieving consensus across a distributed network composed of nodes you don't need to trust. This means it can be open to everyone and serve as a platform for permission-less innovation. Where this may eventually lead is difficult to fully imagine at this point. [This site has just one list of potential applications]( And [this video]( explains Bitcoin's potential well.  


In the context of Greece, Bitcoin can help people avoid bank collapses, ensure access to their funds, and avoid government bail-ins and capital controls. There's also the theory that a government using a currency immune to arbitrary money supply inflation (currency printing/quantitative easing) would be less prone to severe boom-and-bust economic cycles and less able to incur mountains of unsustainable debt.  


As Bitcoin itself is still new, companies in the Bitcoin space are typically quite young and still privately held. As a result, the average investor can't invest directly in Bitcoin-related companies so far. This should be changing pretty quickly in coming years.  
Meanwhile, if you study Bitcoin and come to believe in its potential, price discovery of bitcoin as a digital asset is still occurring. So in that sense, you're correct that buying and holding bitcoin right now is the most direct way to invest in the technology. Ironically, bitcoin the unit won't completely fulfill it's potential as a digital asset until it's much more mature, and price discovery is essentially complete. Only then will volatility be dramatically reduced. At that point bitcoin could very well have better monetary characteristics than conventional alternatives, but buying and holding it as an investment with high growth potential may not make much sense. Still, if it is still around, companies doing Bitcoin-related business would be more established and likely have shares publicly available on stock exchanges, etc. Then Bitcoin-related investment opportunities would be plentiful.  


Bitcoin could be both, but it's early days yet. Purchasing and holding bitcoin should be viewed as a high risk investment, so the often used cliche still holds: best not to invest more than you can afford to lose.  
Aside from investing directly in Bitcoin, everyone can still avail themselves of its usefulness. Exchanging fiat currency for bitcoin and then utilizing it quickly can minimize exposure to volatility. Alternatively, businesses are offering more and more options everyday that leverage Bitcoin's advantages. Many such services should be significantly cheaper than conventional alternatives, or be available in regions that were formerly unserved.  
Even better yet, you could learn how to develop with and for Bitcoin, and create your own beneficial service at essentially no cost to you aside from your invested time. No one is obligated to use Bitcoin, but it is openly available to all that find it useful.

I'd go as far as to say it appears the judge simply railroaded him. In a fair trial, Ulbricht may still have been found guilty (much would hinge on whether the defense could create any real doubt about the bitcoins and journal that were purportedly found on Ulbricht's laptop and which were attributed to him), but at least important constitutional issues, issues of fairness, would have been litigated by *both* sides in the process. This judge's seemingly highly biased rulings, which consistently broke for the prosecution, supplied only this comical farce instead.

Not true at all. After the hard fork, you'll effectively have two block chains. It's very possible the low limit fork could have more hash power (though I think this quite unlikely). Only majority hash power on each block chain will matter. The dominated chain isn't even at risk unless the miners from the other chain gang up to attack. Do you believe this likely?
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:17:02
It'd be best coming concisely from a core dev.  
Actually, what you just wrote is possible in a number of ways. Say after the fork we call each resulting branch bitcoin-A and bitcoin-B. I'm anticipating that wallet makers will only create clients intended to transact one or the other coin, for the sake of minimizing confusion. In this case, to get your suggested transaction happening on both forks virtually at once, you'd simply send the same transaction twice, once from a bitcoin-A wallet, and once from a bitcoin-B wallet (by transaction, I mean sending the same UTXOs to the same destination address(es) on both chains -- of course the raw transactions themselves will be different, as generated by each fork's client).  
In fact, you could always build a wallet that executes transactions on both forks almost simultaneously (assuming the UTXOs are available on both forks), but that'd really be asking for trouble.

Orphan concerns only arise if 20 MB blocks get full instantly.

Don't get me wrong, though. I find it fairly damning that a judge would say there is "'no doubt' that Ulbricht paid for murders of those who had threatened Silk Road."  
EDIT: After doing some more research, I have to say I'm much less impressed by what the judge says in this quote. Ulbricht's trial seems to have been a decidedly unfair and one-sided exercise. I'd go as far as to say it appears the judge simply railroaded him. In a fair trial, Ulbricht may still have been found guilty (much would hinge on whether the defense could create any real doubt about the bitcoins and journal that were purportedly found on Ulbricht's laptop and which were attributed to him), but at least important constitutional issues, issues of fairness, would have been litigated by *both* sides in the process. This judge's seemingly highly biased rulings, which consistently broke for the prosecution, supplied only this comical farce instead.

@_date: 2015-06-05 20:18:23
Not to 1. As the hard fork nears, say you have X number of pools representing Y% of hash rate holding out. Simply reduce difficulty by Y% so that the block time after the fork would be about 10 minutes.  
Or even better, switch to a more responsive difficulty adjusting algorithm (presuming benefits outweigh downsides).  
There'd be no need to touch the mining algorithm itself.

FBI responsibility over the case would mean a federal charge, but murder-for-hire is a state crime. Is the Maryland indictment still being brought? Do you have a link? It seems to have also been quietly dropped. I've searched and can't find any outstanding murder-for-hire charges still pending. And I actually believe all the federal charges are the ones that have just concluded in this trial.  


In the United States you are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. Using implied, possibly unindicted, and definitely unconvicted charges as a reason to affect sentencing (or really for any such prejudicial reason) is, in my opinion, highly improper -- just another example of the lack of even-handedness in this prosecution.  
As it is, you have a man convicted of entirely non-violent crimes sentenced to life in prison. Any one of the six potential murder-for-hire charges is far more serious. If the criminal cases could stand up to the state's implications, why not convict Ulbricht of the weightier charges? Instead, unless someone can show otherwise, all these charges have apparently been dropped.  
I seriously question that it was ever proven there was only one person acting and communicating as DPR, and whether Ulbricht was definitively the person communicating in any specific messages (save potentially the ones he sent in response to the informant when he was actually arrested, and chain of evidence may have even put these in doubt if the defense had been allowed to examine the issue at trial).  
Meanwhile, [within the last five years a single US bank (Wachovia) laundered $378.4 billion of cartel drug money]( -- also a non-violent drug-related crime but of orders of magnitude greater severity.

In the past, before Bitcoin mining became an industrial-scale business, users could mine for themselves and profit. Now it's essentially impossible. To even try, you'd need to start by spending several thousand USD, and then you'd still need to have access to extremely cheap or free electricity and cooling.  
TL;DR: It's now essentially impossible to profit from Bitcoin mining as an individual.
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:18:03
I generally agree, except about the "we paid" part. To me, it's Bitcoin the DAC/DAO that's doing the paying, in units that only have value because the receiver thinks they do. Not to mention the vast majority of the "payment" goes towards the bootstrapping process of issuing new currency units, so I'm hard pressed to see that part as coming out of anyone's pocket (aside from the small portion that's actually transaction fees).
@_date: 2015-06-18 01:53:49
Even though I didn't follow where Hearn brought up checkpoints, now it makes sense to me. I'm sure he raised it in the context of a hard fork where the small block chain has massively more hashing power. I don't think that even needs to be discussed, because in that situation it's clear there's not enough consensus to assume a fork would succeed. However, if the small block contingent even has as much as, say, 70% of total hash rate, I bet a fork could still happen and chains would *eventually* diverge.
@_date: 2015-06-02 18:37:42
The scenario being discussed is hardly optimal, but Hearn is correct in contending that it is feasible to pursue a fork even with less than 50% of hashing power. Both branches after a hard fork can continue to exist for some time regardless of the percentage of total hashing power each has from before the fork.  
It's true that the fork that has less hashing power could be vulnerable to attack from miners on the other fork, but those miners would need to coordinate an attack together and all agree to forgo rewards in the coin that they profess to be supporting. Any rewards they earn while attacking *would be in the other bitcoin*. They would not be able to spend any such rewards earned during an attack in their own fork's economy.  
So there seem to be two possibilities: 1) a fork occurs, and for whatever reason the stronger chain (in terms of hashing power) does not 51% attack the weaker chain, or 2) a fork occurs and the stronger chain does successfully organize a sustained 51% attack on the weaker chain.  
In event the event of 1), both chains will continue as if they are independent SHA256 altcoins. One will eventually start being recognized as more useful or having more value, and therefore support a higher price per unit. If this happens to be chain that also has less hashing power, it will inevitably attract miners from the other fork because profits will be greater when mining the coin that has higher unit value *and* lower difficulty.  
In case of 2) the weaker chain that is getting attacked would need to take measures to continue to function. Another hard fork would likely be required to deploy measures to defeat any continued 51% attack from the stronger fork. In the worst case, the weaker coin could fork to a new hashing algorithm. At that point the stronger fork would have no more ability to attack the other fork, and for the entire duration of the attack they will have given up any chance of getting mining rewards in their own bitcoin. They'd now be stuck with a bunch of *the other bitcoin*, which they would not be able to spend without supporting the competing coin's economy. Even if they never spend or actively destroy the rewards mined during their attack, they'd just make the competing coin more scarce and hence more valuable per unit. Essentially, they will have paid to attack out of their own pockets, given up potential rewards, and only have succeeded in disrupting the other fork temporarily.

To be clear, does this mean you were running three separate full node implementations on the same machine at the same time?
@_date: 2015-06-18 02:21:46
Version number would be a simple way for clients on the large block camp to ignore blocks submitted from non-compliant, earlier, small-block-only clients. Therefore, any attempt to orphan blocks on the large block chain would have to spoof this information to even get evaluated as a valid block by large block clients. For such an attack to succeed, a large proportion individuals that compose the attacking hashrate from the small block camp would have to agree to spoof and continue doing so far a long period of time, clearly behavior that's ethically questionable. It seems unrealistic to me that this could effectively prevent a fork if hashrates of the two camps are of a similar order of magnitude.
@_date: 2015-06-18 02:25:21
I guess I take issue with use of the word "veto" in this case. In my book, a veto is when one party (typically an individual or less numerous group in a democracy) can override the wishes of the opposing camp. I simply do not see that as the case here.
@_date: 2015-06-09 02:24:11
This is great, but shouldn't there be at least one mining pool running on XT compliant large-block code at the same time?  
EDIT: never mind, had it right the first time.
@_date: 2015-06-17 02:21:21
I didn't follow the origin of Hearn's checkpoint remarks, but I'm guessing he only made them in the event hash power on the new chain is drastically less than before. In this case, a checkpoint is one way to kick start things. If there's less hash power, but say still half or so, you could simply put up with longer confirmation times until the next difficulty adjustment.
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:57:26


My personal prediction is that a hard fork won't happen until there is pretty good consensus in the community for one fork or another. In this case, we may already be pretty close now. Several polls I've seen have support for some kind of fork to increase block size at 80% to 90%. However, it's important to realize these are not scientific or representative polls. There are also developers, businesses, international communities, miners, etc. to consider. Still, assuming there is already well over half of the total Bitcoin community in support of a fork to larger blocks, those large-block-bitcoins should start the post-fork era with greater value, more ways to transact, and more hashing power. Right away, they should be seen as more useful and valuable than those of the 1 MB fork. Barring any unforeseen factors, that would imply the 1 MB fork would rapidly lose value in comparison.  


Not sure what you mean by "fork-independent", but I expect wallets after the fork to only work on one fork or the other. Or if the developers of a particular wallet, say Electrum, decides to support both forks, each version would be clearly specified. There still are risks in a hard fork, but the risks that exist do seem manageable.  


Keep in mind that would only be an approximation, as the real value of either coin would be established on the free market. Such markets are notoriously hard to predict. For instance, someone could come up with a use-case for the 1 MB fork that no one anticipated, giving it more value, but not necessarily stealing value from the large block fork at the same time. In such a scenario p+1-p could end up being &gt; 1 after an influx of investment.  


Again, I think my bitcoin/litecoin analogy applies because market valuations after the fork may not be entirely as expected. One counter example to the one I gave above would be if risk-averse investors shy away from both large-block-bitcoin and 1 MB bitcoin after the fork. If that's happens and it's also the biggest influence on market price at the time, the value of both forks together could fall to less than that of bitcoin as a whole before the fork. It's anyone's guess exactly how it will shake out. The one aspect that seems a fairly safe bet to me is that the fork with greater initial value and utility will tend to dominate the other fork, and the value of the dominated fork will drop, if not to zero, at least to a much smaller figure before reaching any equilibrium.

You keep talking about destroying Bitcoin, in the long term or otherwise, but you do not explain how this will come about.  


What is the import of whether a minority miner can or cannot do this?  


This can only happen if they mine the longer chain in secret, and forgo all mining rewards if their attack fails. Should any entity controlling this much hashing power make even a single *attempt* at this, all of the individuals which compose the various pools will defect, and they will have effectively destroyed their business for a very long period, if not forever.  
But nevermind all that, you said the risk to Bitcoin is "not so much from a hostile entity." The longer chain attack you just described most certainly *would be* the work of a hostile entity.


Not true in the least.

The difficulty of mining Bitcoin self-adjusts so that, on average, a block is found every ten minutes. This is regardless of what the worldwide hash rate does. If hash rate continues to grow astronomically, so will difficulty. If miners realize it's becoming too difficult or expensive to mine, and drop out leading to a reduction in global hash rate, difficulty will automatically *decrease* until blocks continue to be found every 10 minutes on average.

The system is designed so that this is impossible, especially at the scope you refer to in OP. You could explain how the blockchain is a sequential ledger of constantly confirmed transactions so that massive theft in a short time period (even if it were possible) would be quickly found and easily reversed. You could try to explain how you'd need collusion from a massive chunk of the most distributed and powerful computing network in the world to only double-spend a handful of transactions. You could explain how the code is open source, and any edits introduced with bad intent would not only be easily found, but would need to achieve ridiculous levels of consensus in the network before having any effect at all.
But I think the proof is in the pudding. When Bitcoin had a valuation of only a few million dollars, it might make sense that no criminals had tried a large theft yet. But now we are talking about an $8B valuation. If it could be done to steal, oh say $25M, wouldn't it have happened by now? If it was doable someone could bag themselves as much as a few billion, right? I'd think that'd be enough incentive to get the top hacker cartel in the world to commit a few tens of millions of dollars to try to pull it off. But as of yet, no joy.  
For criminals, Bitcoin has got to be among the juiciest targets out there, but thefts are always nibbles at the centralized edges of Bitcoin. No single attack on the core distributed network has really ever succeeded.

I'm not a Linux expert so take my feedback with a grain of salt, but my understanding is that the core components of Lubuntu are updated just as Ubuntu (they're both built on Debian). Only the lightweight components on top of the core are different, but those are also updated in a similar way. However, since the lightweight components have a smaller user base, it *is* possible those pieces could have security issues that aren't addressed as quickly. I'm not aware of any known incidents of this in the past, though. And of course, a smaller user base means these components are less attractive targets for hackers also (i.e. this is a major advantage Linux has in general compared to Windows and OSX).

And yes, if the split is very even, you could transact both your 2 "bitcoin" and your 2 "otherbitcoin", each only one time, and the value of "bitcoin" and "otherbitcoin" might be different (though in a nearly perfect 50-50 split, the value *initially* should remain quite similar).  Also, you could only transact "bitcoin" where those are accepted, and "otherbitcoin" where those are accepted. As a receiving party, I'd be very careful if accepting both. Nearly everyone would likely accept one but not the other (at least initially).  
One interesting question is, if such a perfect 50-50 split occurs, it seems to me the value of "bitcoin" *and* "otherbitcoin" should drop almost exactly by 50% right after the fork as compared to before, but I don't know if this is what would actually happen.

However, in your scenario only the holder of one of your multisigs can conceivably steal your coins, as opposed to possibly any attacker without multisig. Add the possibility that the holder has established themselves as a trusted third party, and this multisig use-case still can lead to notably improved security.  
Of course, adding offline signing would only improve security further, but even without it, the benefits seem apparent.

@_date: 2014-05-24 00:17:46
The Bitcoin transaction fees (or miner's fees) you refer to only apply to transferring bitcoin funds you hold to and from an exchange for trading. Once at an exchange, any trading is internal at the exchange an does not incur Bitcoin transaction/miner's fees (fees assessed by the exchange are likely to apply, though).  
However, it's important to remember that once your funds are transferred to any exchange, they are entirely under the control of that exchange, and therefore you must exercise due diligence in selecting a trading organization. If the exchange were to implode like Mt.Gox, your funds would be lost and/or endlessly tied up in litigation.  
Bitcoin transaction/miner's fees would apply again if you were to withdraw bitcoins or deposit more bitcoin to your exchange account. Some organizations, such as Coinbase, even pay these fees for you when transferring from their wallets.  
As to whether $MM/day can be traded, it already happens, but keep in mind that Bitcoin is relatively thinly traded and spread over many exchanges. Large trades can easily move the price. On the other hand, bitcoin trading never closes, so you can spread your trades out over 24 hours a day.  
If you're interested in the exchanges themselves and their fees, here's a table of current exchanges listed by trade volume (note, the rows are of different currency pairs). To find the fees that apply, just visit each exchange's website for details:

IANAL, but this is why it is currently the Wild West in Bitcoin. No legal status has yet been clearly conferred to it. If it had the same legal recognition by law enforcement agencies and courts as the U.S. dollar for example, I think the blockchain would be a huge asset in prosecuting Bitcoin property crimes and settling civil cases. So if you own Bitcoin right now, YOU are responsible for their security. If they leave your possession, there's basically no recourse.
The MtGox case will probably end up driving Japanese law to deal with Bitcoin officially in their civil law system. I've also heard about several U.S. class action cases being brought against MtGox. It'll be interesting to see how those proceed. They should result in some U.S. legal precedents, and once there are enough precedents, law enforcement may decide they can actually act to pursue Bitcoin criminals and proceed to prosecute Bitcoin crimes.

My reply was just to your statement that governments could spend billions in an attack. As I understand it, your suggested bare bones attack would simply raise transactions to the 7 per second limit. This would not stop the Bitcoin network in any way, it would just require users needing their transactions to be picked up in upcoming blocks to raise the fees that they use. A more effective DoT attack would require the attacker use higher than standard transaction fees to try to crowd out legitimate users by making costs prohibitive. This in turn raises the cost to the attacker tremendously and increases the value being added to the Bitcoin network via the attack.

You can be your own bank with Bitcoin. It's borderless, decentralized, and requires no trust in, nor does it depend upon any company, government or organization. Transactions are quick, with low or no fees, and settlements happen in minutes or hours instead of days. And it's irreversible, which can basically eliminate credit card fraud.
@_date: 2014-11-22 14:47:58
No one can say for sure what Bitcoin's transaction fee will be that far into the distant future. However, even if it *does* rise significantly above today's rate, it's likely that next generation alternatives for low fee transactions will be available, perhaps as side chains. If that's the case, the remaining transactions on the Bitcoin network would need to tolerate higher fees and the 10 minute confirmation time to be included into a highly secure block chain. Under these circumstances, Bitcoin may become a network devoted primarily to large value transactions that require this level of assurance.  
I think such a scenario is just one extreme possibility, as Bitcoin's self-adjusting nature should gradually tend to reduce the over-mining that currently exists (relative to the network's level of transactions). Presuming scalability issues are addressed favorably, this could very well mean transaction fees remain low and affordable through 2140 and beyond.
Of course, this all presumes that something better has not supplanted Bitcoin itself in the meantime, something I consider possible but perhaps unlikely (Bitcoin's network advantage should give it time to incorporate external innovations should superior technology emerge.)
@_date: 2014-11-05 23:55:25

The simple answer is that it's because someone else is willing to exchange something that is more traditionally considered to have value for it, such as fiat currency or a good or service. People are willing to do that because of the reasons already posted by others here--digital scarcity, impossible to counterfeit, global low friction transfer over a network that no third-party controls, low fees, deflationary, controlled generation of bitcoins to a maximum limit using a transparent system based only on rules and math, lack of fraud and chargeback risk, third-parties cannot dictate how and what you spend your bitcoin on or how or when you can access all of your bitcoin funds, etc., etc.
@_date: 2014-07-21 08:16:32
Are the same people telling you both things? Because I would agree that wouldn't make any sense. My understanding is that there currently is no guaranteed way to make a zeroconf transacation absolutely safe from a double-spend, and unfortunately, tools like those released by Peter Todd have made zeroconf double-spend attempts trivially easy.  Where zeroconf transactions are being accepted, the risks are known and assumed, or extra measures such as monitoring the network for double-spends and checking for transaction propagation are used (which only reduce the risk, but do not eliminate it). For small value transactions, many decide it's still acceptable, not unlike leaving a cash payment on a restaurant table, but this is an individual decision.

I've got no problem with insurance, but insurance should be *optional*.

I believe Blockchain.info's My Wallet is safer than holding bitcoins in a site that has full control of your bitcoin funds (access to the private keys).

I agree that there's no mature crypto-only exchange yet, but there are many proposals to implement them, some based to varying degrees upon Bitcoin.

This thread is primarily about exchanges that also do fiat, and in this case Ripple has not distinguished itself as a solution that is superior in any way.

As mentioned there are some reports of delays or cancellations, and like most growing Bitcoin businesses, their customer support can take as much as a couple of days to get back to you. Still, in my opinion, they're about as solid as you get for Bitcoin in the U.S. right now.

That looks great, but to me there's a simple and very basic problem. Darkcoin InstantX uses masternodes. These are a subset of nodes different from common nodes. This is clearly a step away from the truer decentralization achieved in Bitcoin.  
My understanding is, once you move away from decentralization, there are *many* possible ways to implement instant transactions. But at the same time, you lose the advantages of a more decentralized system. To me, Bitcoin functions as a layer that is close to optimally decentralized. If services that require some level of centralization are needed, they can and should be built on top of that.  
I'm not sure if InstantX is something that is tied into Darkcoin protocols at a low level, but if it is, it would take a *lot* to convince me that is an acceptable compromise.  
On the other hand, if InstantX is something that rides *on top* of Darkcoin, I don't see why it can't be added on top of any other crypto-currency that evolved from Bitcoin, including of course, the original.

I'm hoping the answer will soon be, "Because of the discounts and incentives offered by merchants."  
Use of Bitcoin arguably offers merchants more direct advantages than to consumers. They directly enjoy the lower transaction fees, virtually zero fraud, much faster settlement times, and lack of chargebacks. However, they should eventually also realize that the more customers use  Bitcoin over CC, the more money they save. This should drive them to offer incentives to their customers to drive its use.

If it really has to be large amounts *and* near market price, the most economical way may be to run an efficient mining operation. It would take substantial investment and would need to be run properly, but you could come close to breaking even or possibly eek out a profit depending on the size of your operation and its overhead costs.

On the contrary, regardless of how one views banks, banking services are still instrumental in allowing consumers and businesses to leverage their own resources in order to efficiently create new value. The ridiculous barriers to entry and ongoing fees that are saddled on the world's poor by legacy systems only serve to increase wealth disparity, not improve it. How can the vast reduction or complete removal of these impediments not open doors for success and growth?

If you have the private keys, you can always manually create your own transactions (not that I know how or have ever done this). If you are manually creating your transactions, there's no need to wait for the output from Blockchain.info or Bitcoin Core, as you are assembling the transaction piece by piece and step by step. On the other hand, if you're trying to do a transaction malleability attack where you *don't* have the private keys, then you would need to get a transaction when or *before* it's submitted to the network to mutate the transaction ID (perhaps via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack). To me, this seems very difficult, but apparently it's been done, but it's definitely *not* as common as was claimed by some "victims".  
I just realized, though, that I may be misunderstanding you. Are you trying to mutate a transaction, or are you just trying to double-spend? If you're trying to double-spend, things are much simpler, but still can't really be done with any regular wallets. I believe Peter Todd has created a toolkit that facilitates this called Replace by Fee or something.

Sorry to hear about the Cryptowall infection. A new option to buy bitcoin may eventually turn out to be the best, and some report they can buy $500 instantly. This broker is called [Circle]( But remember, they're new, so they've been going through some teething problems. Not everyone has a great first experience. When things go wrong, people report cancelled orders and delays, but I haven't seen reports of Circle stealing anyone's money. You can buy via US bank ACH or using credit card, but the credit card option includes at least a 3% fee in addition to possible cash advance or other charges from your credit card provider.  
If Circle doesn't work out, a sure bet is [LocalBitcoins]( If you use them, make sure you pick a trustworthy seller, use escrow, and use common sense precautions (don't meet in dark alleys, etc.)  
There's also [Bitquick.co]( and the [Mycelium Android wallet app's]( Buy / Sell feature.

I think a big part of the bad rap started before Bitcoin. In many ways Bitcoin is the first successful (so far) digital currency. All previous attempts had fatal flaws, turned out to be scams, or failed quickly. That history tends to build low expectations and a bad reputation.

I can't disagree entirely. However OP argues that Bitcoin would be overtaken *instantly*. I don't believe this to be true.  
Regarding your points specifically:  
* Whatever the absolute size of Bitcoin's first-mover advantage, it seems to exist and is not insignificant. It's something even the deepest pocketed organization would be wise to consider before creating a Bitcoin copy. This advantage also seems to be growing every day with the new investments that are flowing in to the Bitcoin space. Current investors would likely attempt to counter any moves by a new player, such as paying a large merchant services provider for integration.
* People would like a party to blame should things go wrong, but being that responsible party in such an instance could also be something any centralized major player would be concerned about. Bitcoin is still experimental. And it might continue to be too experimental to serve as some kind of branded currency until it has already established itself. By that time, it or whichever open-source cryptocurrency eventually succeeds, could prove impossible to dislodge. (In the preceding, I'm assuming that the new player would try to launch a decentralized cryptocurrency under their aegis.)  
I do certainly agree that previous centralized money attempts proved to be too easily targeted. The only way a Google-like entity could avoid that is by launching a decentralized cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or one of its similar altcoins, but branded with the big player's name. But then, what's in a name? Such a creation would prove troublesome, if not impossible, for the big player to control.

I'm not sure if anyone has directly answered your question yet. Pretty much everyone is expressing why it's impossible that the same private/public pair would be generated again accidentally (aka a collision). In all reality, that's all true.
Now, I think you want us to assume somehow a private/public pair was duplicated randomly, however each used a different BIP 0038 password. Would the different password be able to decrypt the other identical private key. I believe the answer to this is no. BIP 0038 is an encryption on top of the private key. So if two identical private keys were encrypted each with different passwords, interchanging the passwords would not be able to decrypt the other encrypted private key.

Sweeping an address is moving the *entire* bitcoin balance from a public address/private key pair (such as from a paper wallet) to a new pair. This is done for a couple of reasons: 1) It is best practice not to re-use a public address to enhance privacy, and 2) Paper wallets are often used as cold storage, but importing the private key(s) from them often exposes the key to an online system, thus compromising their "cold" nature.  
If the desire is to spend part of the balance of a paper wallet, it's best to import and sweep the wallet's entire balance, spend the amount desired from the wallet that imported the amount, then send any remainder to the public address of a new, unused cold paper wallet.  
Although multiple wallets can use the same public address, it's not a good idea to do so for any number of reasons. If a single fixed address is needed to receive funds over a period of time, the current best method would be to employ a [stealth address]( There are [toolkits]( that enable using stealth addresses now, but the functionality has not yet been incorporated into any wallets that I am aware of.  
[See the comments from this thread]( for some methods for importing and sweeping paper wallets (videos are included).

I'm not expert at the cryptography of Bitcoin, but this is the gist of it from what I understand. If anyone can correct me on any details, I'd be grateful. Basically, single use addresses never expose the public keys from which they are derived to the network. As soon as you spend from an address the first time, the public key for that address is revealed to the network. If someone were to attempt to brute force a private key from information publicly available, knowing the public key is one step (one hash specifically) closer to getting there. Of course, each cryptographic step used in Bitcoin is astronomically difficult to reverse, which is why I wrote the effect is small.  
The other effect is that each time you spend from a single address you are signing a transaction with the static private key associated with that address. This publicizes to the network additional signatures that were made using that private key. If those signatures are somehow collected by an attacker, they may be used as collective data points that could be used to aid a brute force attack. My understanding is that right now, there are no known weaknesses in the cryptography of Bitcoin such that any number of these digital signatures could realistically help break the system, but some future breakthrough in cryptography could change the lay of the land.  
Finally, re-using an address increases its prominence in the block chain, which conceivably could make it a more tempting target to attackers.  
EDIT: grammar
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:04:07
That's my understanding. And it's not even gaming so much, because you can't really control which miner wins a block and when they received the transaction. It's luck of the draw if you hit one that doesn't like MtGox's outdated TxID representation and then takes it upon itself to update it to a compliant version. But as time went on and more and more network nodes updated, apparently more started doing this mutating. At some point someone may have observed it and tried to get mutating nodes "in front" of MtGox so it would happen more often, but I don't know how you would detect/determine that.
EDIT: But if this was happening *AT ALL* there should be proof in the blockchain. I've heard of none.

How does a bank getting robbed not affect your bank balance? Because the bank or government insurance may replace your funds, you think those replacement funds come out of thin air? Also, all those constructs, the physical security, the insurance, the tracking of the criminal activity, the bank security, the police departments, the FBI--that all costs money. And some of it is either coming out of your bank account as taxes and/or fees, or your not earning as much interest as you otherwise could.  
This is why the inherent security of digital currencies like Bitcoin should matter to anyone that currently uses fiat. In the long run, using digital currencies should save a lot of value. Or viewed another way, it should dramatically reduce the existing overhead and friction in the storage and exchange of value.

You could also explain that while the technologies introduced by Bitcoin are revolutionary and will certainly be here long-term, whether Bitcoin itself is *the* cryptocurrency in 20 years (if there even is such a singular thing) can't be predicted. Bitcoin clearly has the first-mover and network advantages now, though.
It's likely that they'll just want to know how to get bitcoins, how to keep them safe, and perhaps how to use them. Assuming you're in the US, a very simple set-up would be Coinbase, a Blockchain.info My Wallet (backed up, of course), and a cold paper wallet for bulk storage if they intend to purchase a significant amount (educate yourself on booting to a Live CD to create truly cold paper wallets offline). You could demo how they're sent and received, and be sure to explain how divisible they are.  
If they want to know more about Bitcoin itself, I would just go with the online video resources starting with the intro video at bitcoin.org. If they want more detail, this video is good:

Just save the wallet.dat file, everything else can go if you no longer want to use that Bitcoin Core-based wallet.  
EDIT: This doesn't necessarily mean someone has been mining on your computer (although that is possible). It only means someone once ran a Bitcoin wallet on your computer that downloaded the full block chain. Since there's only 6.6GB and we're currently at ~25GB, that wallet is pretty out of date. It's probably been some time since the wallet was last synced (assuming it ever was fully synced).

A paper wallet is perfectly spendable. The only danger is that the receiving party can't assume the person who paid it does not have a copy of the private key, so it should be swept immediately.
The hottest wallets are only as unsafe as the computer systems they reside upon. I think this is akin to how one would carry cash. If you carry it in a purse or wallet, it's not super safe, but it's better than if you lick a $100 bill and slap it on your forehead.  
EDIT: Not to mention that you can't encrypt cash, but you can easily encrypt any private keys you carry, instantly rendering them vastly safer than cash.

Since any such implementation would be centralized to some degree anyway, I wonder if they would stay with a distributed proof-of-work model. It seems they would need to find some other benefit from it to keep it in their system. Actually, they would probably want to do away with it since lacking massive hashing power it would be a vulnerable attack vector.

Yes, I agree you are insured, because you and other customers at merchants that you use credit cards with subsidize that service. However, the reason such service is important is because the antiquated methods the credit and debit card industries use to authorize purchases are so vulnerable to credit card fraud.  
Bitcoin works at the cash level, it just happens to be a cash level equivalent that has 21st century electronic transaction capabilities built-in at much lower fees then current systems. Cash doesn't inherently come with insurance, so neither does Bitcoin. But the good thing is, except for endpoint loss (which the Bitcoin owner should strictly be responsible for, and to which current conventional electronic finance methods are equally susceptible), Bitcoin doesn't really need the insurance.  
Multisig and nLockTime aspects of Bitcoin that aren't yet fully implemented. Bitcoin is only 4-5 years old (2 years of which it wasn't really getting used by much at all). I for one think its pace of innovation is pretty remarkable. How much has changed in the banking or credit card industries in the same amount of time? And those both have had the advantage of being mature industries for decades or centuries.  
I really do think merchants will eventually use technologies that will allow them to earn higher profits, offer lower prices, and draw more customers. But that's just me.

All Bitcoin addresses, including change addresses, are permanent. It's only best practice not to re-use addresses. In fact, some wallets will even allow you to use the original address you are sending from as that transaction's change address (so effectively, there'd be no change address). I'm not familiar with keybase.io, but from what I gather, this could be a case where a single Bitcoin address is intended to be re-used regularly. Just know that such an address's privacy (and to a very small extent, its security) is somewhat worse than that of a single-use address. Also, make sure you never lose the private key to such an address if you intend on receiving funds there repeatedly over a long period of time (for instance, this could happen years later if you choose migrate to a new wallet that has a different private key storing scheme and just send all your funds over in one or more Bitcoin transactions; for an address you want to keep re-using you might need to manually export its private key in such a case).

Very true, but you could also mention that while a high risk investment includes the possibility of high or even complete losses, it also means the possibility of (very) high returns.

TL;DR, here's the Conclusion paragraph:
The transaction malleability problem is real and should be considered when implementing Bitcoin clients. However, while MtGox claimed to have lost 850,000 bitcoins due to malleability attacks, we merely observed a total of 302,000 bitcoins ever being involved in malleability attacks. Of these, only 1,811 bitcoins were in attacks before MtGox stopped users from withdrawing bitcoins. Even more, 78.64% of these attacks were ineffective. As such, barely 386 bitcoins could have been stolen using malleability attacks from MtGox or from other businesses. Even if all of these attacks were targeted against MtGox, MtGox needs to explain the whereabouts of 849,600 bitcoins.

If you're referring to using a payment provider to implement a payment system in your website and avoid any volatility, I'm sure you could contact the service providers directly:  
  
  
They should be happy to help with anything you will need. If you use a payment system and convert all of your funds to fiat, you won't need to worry about secure storage of your bitcoins.  
If you're referring to hiring someone to handle secure storage of bitcoins for you, I'm sure you can, but this is more troublesome. Secure storage is really something you should learn and handle yourself. Anyone you hire could potentially steal your bitcoin funds long after they advise you or set up your system. If you hire anyone, I'd suggest you have them show you how to set up a low value system. Then afterward, set up a new one yourself with a new cold private key. It would also be advisable to double-check what you learn from any consultant with what you read about secure cold storage online.  
The Bitcoin space is too new to have a single large and trusted consulting organization that provides services like this, but any number of enthusiasts in your area could likely help you. You could Google bitcoin meetups in your area, or just check the results when you Google bitcoin consulting.

They may use a system similar to the one that's going to be rolled out in Mycelium's Local Trader feature. It can monitor many nodes and see how a transaction propagates across them.

If you're not manually constructing the raw transaction, how did the spent input get included? Are you using Blockchain.info's My Wallet? If so, it's a bug in their system and you'll either need to work with their support, or you can export your private keys and import them into a different wallet. If you choose to export your keys, you might be able to try a double-spend right away as long as enough memory pools have rejected the original transaction. Otherwise, I think Blockchain's wallet returns funds if a transaction still isn't confirmed after 72 hours. Once the funds return, you can just create a new send transaction using Coin Control and omit the already spent coins.

First of all, you cannot 'mal' the portion of the transaction that designates the destination public address as that portion is signed by the sender's private key. Only the Transaction ID portion is unsigned.
I think there is no question that if Satoshi Nakamoto had it to do over again, knowing what we know now, he would make changes so that transaction malleability is not possible. The same is also true for the aspect of the reference wallet that allows spending of unconfirmed change inputs in the last couple of years since the problem was identified.
That said, two significant mitigating factors exist:
1.) For bitcoin senders and receivers, transaction malleability never threatens the validity of a transaction. So in that sense, it's ultimately not a critical issue for the protocol. It's serious and needs to be fixed, but funds were never jeopardized.
2.) As the problem itself was fully identified back in May 2011, business entities that process bitcoin transactions in a higher volume or higher velocity manner such as exchanges should have exercised the required care to properly handle this known imperfection since then. In this respect, I'd say more blame for the recent large disruption to the community lies with these businesses than with the core Bitcoin protocol. MtGox was a particularly bad offender in that their own flawed implementation created their own crisis forcing them to stop allowing withdrawals. Karpeles then tried to lay blame on the malleability issue known since 2011. This had the effect of throwing a spotlight on the attack vector for DoS bad actors.

If you point your gun at the heads of the two top mining pools once, they're both destroyed as resources for the future. Do it enough, and the large mining pools gradually reduce into an army of small ones, making the job that much more difficult.  
In DPOS, you may need to point your gun at 51 delegates, but you pretty much know who all 101 are for an extended period of time. It could be like shooting fish in a barrel. Plus, I thought the delegates take turns generating blocks. Is the sequence known? If so, could you strategically just point your gun at the ones that will be generating it in a chain to simplify a 3, 6, 10 confirmation attack?  
Finally, isn't it true that at scale, each delegate would need to have large resources to support a high number of transactions? But what about those clamoring to be delegates — say numbers 102-150 — are they expected to keep resources available in case they get elected as a delegate? What is their economic incentive for doing this? If there aren't enough standby delegates, and there is a sizable attack, isn't the capability of the network at risk?  
If there's ever such an attack on Bitcoin, individual miners would quickly flee to other pools, create their own (preferably P2Pools-based) pool, or even solo mine. No need to scramble to find replacement delegates that have the necessary resources to generate high transaction blocks.

The pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin makes it generally very difficult for someone to know how much you have just from seeing a send transaction. To an outside party, any transaction is just a send from one or more public addresses to generally two or more receive addresses. Without an inordinate amount of network and real world surveillance, it should be quite hard for anyone to pin any set of addresses to a particular person. Even if this is done somehow, it only sets a lower limit for that person's Bitcoin wealth, since it would still be unknown how many other public addresses are in that person's wallet or wallets.
In other words, transactions just show "from" addresses and "to" addresses and amounts sent. But in general, no one knows who owns which addresses, apart from the sender and the recipient in any particular transaction.

As soon as you sign up for Coinbase, you have a Coinbase wallet. Any Bitcoins you "own" at Coinbase are in this wallet.
Coinbase has several verification levels. Did you complete them all? If you did, and you added a Visa card as a backup purchase method, you should have a daily limit up to which you can make instant purchases. Personally, my instant buy limit is $1,000 USD per day, but I don't know if this limit is the same for all customers.
If you got notified that it will be 4 days until the bitcoin arrives in your account, it sounds like you made just a standard purchase and not an instant buy. I'd check to make sure you completed all verification levels. Completing them now won't speed up this purchase, but will allow you to make instant buys in the future.
One minor warning. Coinbase seems to be a transparent and reputable company. I would recommend them and I have had no problems in my dealings with them. However, if your coins are in your Coinbase wallet, they are actually in control of a third-party; Coinbase. In other words, you don't control the private keys to those coins. If Coinbase were to go MtGox (something I think is extremely unlikely), your coins could disappear. Best practice would be to take any coins you plan to hold for a long time and withdraw them to cold storage. [Here's a link to a recent guide at Pastebin]( but a little searching will reveal many other cold storage methods.
Also, for internal transfers (sends to other Coinbase addresses), I understand that Coinbase transactions complete quickly. But I've seem a good number of posts about occasional delays sending from Coinbase wallets to external Bitcoin addresses.

You may also consider the fees you pay small, but others would disagree. Banks also impose costs by not paying as much interest as they otherwise might. How's the interest you've been earning recently? Banks earn the bulk of their profits by risking investments using your money at essentially no risk to themselves. I for one think I deserve a bigger piece of the pie if it's my money at risk. If you depend on bank insurance, remember that the insurance dues are again paid for through fees, reduced interest payments and sometimes even through taxes. And if banks are so safe, why the hell is insurance mandated by law to begin with?

Thanks. I believe I knew something about several instances that OP may have referred to, but as far as I know, none did any disruption to Bitcoin aside from stirring up controversy in the community. Eventually, either through normal market forces, or as a result of community action or pressure, GHash.io's hashrate percentage dropped markedly. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm not aware of any 51% attacks made on any of these occasions.

You used to be able to mine with just a PC's CPU. Then the advanced processors on powerful video cards became the mining tools of choice. Unfortunately, now Bitcoin mining has become big business and the only competitive miners are built with custom made chips known as ASICs. To build your own you'd need to be able to design chip architecture and have access to a state-of-the-art chip foundry. So for small operators, there's basically zero chance to make a profit mining these days.

I think Armory may have the most developed interface for this, but I haven't tried it out myself. An online installation of Armory is not a light client since it is built on a full copy of Bitcoin Core and requires a copy of the blockchain. But if you just use an offline copy to sign raw transactions, etc., that would not require a copy of the blockchain and could be considered a light install.

No merchant would have accepted it as a zero confirmation transaction in this case, because the transaction was never accepted to the network. Merchants that accept zero confirmation transactions only do so once the transaction has been accepted by some number of miners, even if the first confirmation block has not yet been found.

Bitcoin by itself is most similar to cash as a payment method, but with the added benefit of a permanent public record of every transaction in the block chain. So just like cash, once you pay with it, it's true that you no longer have any control of the spent funds. Despite this, cash still seems to be a useful concept. Why is it any different with Bitcoin?  
However, simply by leveraging multisig escrow, anyone can easily engage in high-confidence large value Bitcoin transactions. If you still feel that the chargeback mechanism is a valuable feature and that others would agree with you, build your own credit card-type service on top of Bitcoin. If you're right, you should eventually make enormous profits.

I still would not recommend storing a large amount there.

Bitcoin is an experiment, so there is no guarantee as to what it may become or even if it will survive. At this point, the community is strongly motivated to keep its use affordable for their own good and to appeal to newcomers. In the future, the situation may be dramatically different. If Bitcoin is used heavily enough to generate volumes where transactions must compete to be included in upcoming blocks, transaction fees could increase. But this presupposes much higher Bitcoin use, which is another way of saying that Bitcoin would have become a major success. And even in this case, high fees is an extreme possibility.  
But even in the extreme case of significantly higher transaction fees and only large value transactions on the Bitcoin block chain, many solutions that may be better suited to fast-confirming microtransactions are already being developed. All currently compromise Bitcoin's decentralization or security, but for small value transactions these compromises may be acceptable. Although you could implement some solutions right now (or at least very soon), if you fast forward to the future where large Bitcoin transaction fees *might* be an issue, current efforts would almost certainly be considered crude. For instance, you could peg [Fastcoin (FST)]( as a Bitcoin sidechain quite easily, but it's existing minuscule network and market cap would make it a poor solution. Personally, I'm curious to see what something like [Open Transacations]( might accomplish.  
EDIT: I should also mention that a number of micropayment channels for Bitcoin already exist in the wild. They all have their pros and cons, and none has been widely implemented yet. And those are separate from the several centralized commercial approaches, like Coinbase and ChangeTip, which already exist as well.

Bitcoin is very young and basically still experimental, so it can definitely fail in any number of ways. However, IMHO the scenario you suggest does not seem very likely, at least not in the near future.  
As far as the federal reserve and fiat being a scam, I'd say that's an overstatement at the very least. That's just the way things have been done for quite a long time. But the existing system is far from perfect. If we can strive for improvement, why not try?

The block chain is less efficient and does add overhead compared to legacy centralized databases, but let's see what you get for the cost. Centralized databases, such as those used in banks and financial institutions, put society's money completely at the control of a limited number of humans. This has inevitably resulted in losses due to mistakes, poor management, inefficiency, corruption, theft, embezzlement, etc., etc. The block chain allows the same functionality to be made available while subjecting control only to incorruptible math.  
Sure, on its own, a block chain-based system like Bitcoin might seem inefficient, but only without considering what it can potentially replace. Hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars worth of losses due to the criminality and corruption of existing financial institutions and governments. All the infrastructure surrounding such institutions themselves. All the obscenely self-paid fat cat bankers and board members. The world's economy could be freed from this endlessly greedy parasitic drag.  
And this is just what the block chain may do for the world as it exists now. At this point, we really can't even envision what emerging block chain 2.0 innovation might bring.

That's not good, but the transaction that just went through was only for ~$0.37 USD. That wasn't an actual ATM transaction, right?  
I've been told the small output criteria is no longer part of calculating the recommended fee, but I didn't verify this for myself. If it still is, that may be part of the reason the "637daea..." transaction was delayed.  
Bitcoin Core calculates a recommended fee for each send, but I'm not sure how it does it. If you could adapt that for your purposes it may help.

From what you wrote, though, it sounds like you have not fully grasped the capabilities of Bitcoin as it is now, even as 1.0. Bitcoin is a unit of measure that is impossible to counterfeit issued by rules only relying on math in an agreed upon protocol, at a rate that is known to everyone up to a maximum limit of 21 million units. Your hypothetical "papercoin" could be counterfeited by you and anyone else with the same or similar printer, or by innumerable other counterfeiting techniques.
Even if you are the official issuer of "Papercoin", anyone using it would be reliant on how and when you decide to create more, by opaque determination only known to you.
Bitcoin's decentralized network of trust-less peers allows you to send and receive it to and from anyone else on the network, anywhere in the world, nearly instantaneously and at very low cost. Doing something similar with "Papercoin" would involve physically transporting some amount of paper, or building up a monumental banking system such as what we have in fiat now, full of centralized institutions that require you to trust them as you use them, and all adding expense. "Papercoin" would also encounter problems when trying to transact with another region that may use another currency such as (pulling this out of my a**) "Ragcoin", whereas Bitcoin is comparitively frictionless in the same case.
This is only a few of it's current capabilities, and it along with other cryptos is constantly developing and evolving. Bitcoin, as the current dominant digital currency will be well positioned to adopt future innovations which may arise elsewhere in the cryptocurrency space as long as the Bitcoin network achieves consensus as to the benefits of the innovation in question.
IMO Bitcoin is quite revolutionary and also well positioned as it stands now. And things only seem to be improving (albeit with some significant bumps in the road) as time goes on.
It is true that there is large volatility in Bitcoin currently, but even over it's short history, it is clear that the volatility is already decreasing with time. Can you explain which Bitcoin shortcomings in your view are a cause of long-term and continued extreme volatility?
@_date: 2014-04-06 22:30:53

Any loss/leakage due to incompetence should leave evidence as repeated sends from Gox in the blockchain. Add all those up and you'd have the total lost due the their screw-up.

I don't think there's any confirmation yet that that figure is even accurate. Most seem to think it's the right ball park, though. According to Gox, they suffered losses as a result of the way their system wrongly handled the transaction malleability issue. If this is true, there should be many, many duplicated payouts in the blockchain (each much smaller than the total loss figure, of course). I haven't heard that anyone has even found one set yet.

I don't disagree with you that there are innumerable ways to beat ID systems, but a lot of the methods you just mentioned could be used to fake identity in person, also. Am I wrong?  
As I said, there's no way the process can be completely decentralized end-to-end, since the need for identification itself is a centralized requirement. But the situation seems the same right now. You could have John Doe in a room with all ~~7~~ 9 Supreme Court Justices, and they could try to check his DNA. The justices still need to trust the collecting technician, the lab, the DNA sample being compared to, etc. But that kind of verification is done IRL all the time. At some point you draw the line and say "I trust this process *enough*."  
If that is the point, then the question is can a person ever trust remote ID verification enough. It seems it could be made to satisfy me. It might not be practical, and apparently based on your concerns, it might not ever be made rigorous enough to convince everybody. Will it be good enough for enough people so it gets implemented and tried? That to me is very interesting.
The verification alternatives I presented just give methods of verifying ID *to various degrees* remotely. Any data collected for comparison is theoretically compared to records indexed/stored in a block chain based system or systems. Each such linked piece of ID evidence could have it's own trust rating or credibility score as compared to an ultimate DNA match. Even the method by which verification data was collected at a remote location could be scored in terms of confidence. If conflicting information is ever found at some level, it would change values throughout the ID web for that individual. But the method of ID verification being used would also inform the verification seeker of the level of uncertainty involved. I don't think we'd ever demand DNA verification for nationwide voting purposes, but I think there are possibilities that a scheme could be created where ID is verified with enough confidence that voting might be trusted, even from remote locations.  
The details are all pie-in-the-sky, and I'm very likely completely off from how a system like this will look if it ever becomes a reality. I'll keep an eye on the space and see if I get convinced it can't ever work.

First thing, keep backups of the "wallet.dat" file that you just found. Next, assuming you can get their recently sometimes flakey functionality to work properly, you could try importing the wallet.dat into a Blockchain.info My Wallet:  
  
Follow these instructions:  
  
If this works, this is a short, fast way to access the coins.  
The longer method would be to download a modern copy of the Bitcoin Core/Qt wallet from here:  
  
Install it on a different computer, then sync the Bitcoin Core/Qt instance up with the block chain (which could take days--or you could use the bootstrap.dat shortcut method: just Google this, or search this subreddit and/or BitcoinTalk), close the running instance of Bitcoin Core/Qt, and replace the newly created but empty "wallet.dat" file with a copy of the "wallet.dat" that you found on your old computer. Find specifics here:  
  
Then the new instance of Bitcoin Core/Qt should function normally with the balance that you found the next time you run the program.  
Good luck.  
EDIT: If the amount you found is significant, you may want to learn more about Bitcoin security before doing this. You would want to do this using clean, secure, uncompromised computers. Once you have access to the coins, large amounts should be stored using a secure cold storage method.  
EDIT 2: Forgot to mention, do not send a copy of the found "wallet.dat" file to anyone, and keep it secure from theft.

In addition, the Phillipines is far from the only example. There seem to be numerous examples in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. All places that do not enjoy the level of access to financial services taken for granted in the first world. I admit that none has yet reached a critical mass or tipping point, but whether the adoption and awareness that seems to be growing rapidly is real or not should be clear within the next year.

There is absolutely no reason participants in the existing financial system can't make their own digital currency, just like there is no reason preventing anyone else from creating another one. In fact, existing financial systems primarily are similar electronic payment systems already, with acronyms like ACH, SEPA, SWIFT, etc. The difference is, existing legacy systems typically shuttle around *representations* of some kind of fiat currency, and they are all *centralized*. The vast majority of fiat currency in the world exists simply as digital representations in these various systems. Only some 8% is physical, printed money.  
However, a lot of the benefits of new digital currencies like Bitcoin derive from the fact that they are *decentralized*. Any person or entity choosing to make their own digital currency/payment network faces the dilemma of choosing to make it another centralized system (which would naturally not have many of the advantages of a system like Bitcoin, but would allow the issuer to maintain control), or they could choose to create another decentralized digital currency. If they choose the latter, to compete with or surpass Bitcoin the newcomer would need to contend with Bitcoin's first-mover advantage, as exemplified by it's dominant market capitalization among cryptocurrencies (~$7 billion USD), it's large existing network security component (~170,000,000 GH/s), and it's current lead in market adoption. Not to mention that any such newly issued digital currency sponsored or created by an existing financial entity would likely be regarded with suspicion from current decentralized digital currency users, as it would likely be subject to tampering or control by the creating party.  
As to why a member of an existing fiat financial system would choose to adopt a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, it's very likely that most will try to ignore or resist it at least initially. Most will probably see it as a threat to their business models. However, if there is profit to be made by using it due to it's growing use in the marketplace, and/or due to the added efficiencies it permits, some entities will likely start to adopt it simply to gain a competitive advantage. From there, free market tendencies could force competitors try to match the advantage either by improving their existing systems or by also adopting a viable decentralized cryptocurrency themselves. However, choosing to launch and make practical and competitive a new, decentralized digital currency would seem to carry a high risk of failure given Bitcoin's existing market advantages.

The question is not whether or not you can trust Bitcoin, the question is whether or not you can trust yourself to *secure* your own bitcoin. The problem in this situation is that Bitcoin is entirely trustworthy but also completely impartial, and the crooks know this too. The protocol doesn't care who can produce a digital signature from a private key, once it has such a signature it does its job perfectly and without corruption. So a Bitcoin user *must* be responsible for securing his/her own private keys to keep them out of the hands of bad actors.  
It should be up to the Bitcoin community to properly inform those new to Bitcoin of the risks and how to properly mitigate them. In the case you linked, I think Blockchain.info is at least partly to blame. There's been a rash of recent thefts from Blockchain.info My Wallets. Apparently all were *not* secured by 2FA. This indicates there is some new malware, social engineering attack, or flaw associated with that service. If Blockchain was on the ball, they'd notify new sign-ups and existing users of the concern and insist on 2FA. They should also be actively investigating how the attacks are occurring. As far as I know, BC.i has taken no action at all.  
Bitcoin is still young, and the available security for it is rapidly evolving. Everyone new to it should be informed not to commit significant amounts until they are confident about the digital security they will be employing. As users choose to invest more, they need to study more advanced security techniques, including but not limited to 2FA, paper wallets, cold storage, offline signing, hardware wallets, and/or multisig.

My understanding is that you can't really steal coins by this exploit. However, MtGox's system tried to verify it's sends by checking for the transaction IDs in of each send in the blockchain. If these IDs were mutated (which may have happened via nodes/miners in the network just trying make MtGox's non-conforming IDs match current standards) before getting confirmed, then Gox's system wouldn't know the payment went through becuase that ID had changed. Now here's the really careless bit: they apparently had an automated system that would check by this wrong method and once it didn't get verification, it would generate a new send without any human verification. So in this case, it's not really active stealing on the receiver's side, it's taking advantage of a broken system once you stumble across it. In fact, once this starts happening, it could happen many times for each transaction, until one send went through a path in the network where the ID did not mutate. It's pretty mind blowing.

Yeah, I think making XRP cheap is something they can always do at any time as long as they keep sitting on a fair amount of the pre-mined hoard. The question is do they always want to keep it cheap as they claim. If you look at it over recent history, it seems they are keeping it slightly growing when compared to most cryptos, including Bitcoin.  
I may be wrong, but I thought the transaction fees in Ripple always involve some small amount of XRP. And part of my reason for feeling that Ripple is stagnating is that all the points where exchange between different forms of currency happen in Ripple are at the centralized institutions at the edge of the Ripple network. By this time, it seems there should be more options appearing for these services, but if anything, these seem to be disappearing gradually.

But can verification of any sort, including in-person in real life, ever be done without external dependencies?
I'm interested to see if things can be done with verification that will allow trusted things to happen remotely in future that aren't being done today. More specifically, I wonder if the benefits of the block chain can be applied towards this end. Perhaps remote ID verification may never be a perfect form of identity verification (whatever that means), but just having a good enough system -- like Bitcoin seems to be for value transfer -- will definitely hold my interest.

I think the following are some of the implications:  
1) The value of bitcoin cannot be arbitrarily devalued via the printing and issuance of more units by any bank.  
2) Access to your funds cannot be restricted by a bank or government. Currently only between 8 and 11% of fiat exists as physical currency. If you have a substantial amount in the bank, on any given day, go in and try to withdraw the total in cash to see what kind of roadblocks you may encounter.  
3) Your bitcoins are immune to bail-ins or negative interest rate issues.  
4) Bitcoins are generally not insured, but you should ask yourself if banks are so safe, why do they need so much insurance? It's because of the long history of bank failures and collapses that have caused the loss of depositors' funds. When a bank fails and insurance is paid to make depositors whole, where do you suppose those funds come from? Bitcoin users that choose to handle their own security do not incur the hidden costs that are levied upon all fiat and/or bank users.  
5) The ability for individuals to hold and secure their own bitcoins, and Bitcoin's ability to be transactionally transparent can serve as safeguards against banks' sometimes irresponsible fractional reserve practices which have contributed to financial boom and bust cycles, last seen in the 2008 financial crisis.  
6) Bitcoin is borderless and fully available, with no withdrawal, deposit, or use limits at any time, day or night.  
7) Possession or transaction of bitcoin is not subject to the whims of bank or government policy. For example, banks variably *interpret* government KYC/AML regulations sometimes by closing their customers accounts without warning or explanation. [Operation Choke Point]( is another example of this behavior.  
8) Bitcoin's inherent cryptographic and programmable nature allow a wide variety of security to be used, completely at the users' discretion. The development and innovation of new Bitcoin security features is rapid, especially compared to stagnant legacy banking systems.  
9) Bitcoin dramatically reduces or removes barriers to entry for individuals and businesses that may otherwise find access to legacy banking or merchant systems difficult or impossible.  
10) Bitcoin facilitates peer-to-peer and micro-lending to anyone, worldwide.  
11) Bitcoin's inherently low transaction cost enables micropayments without requiring the exchange and possible loss of private information.  
12) All the services and protections that banks and credit card companies make available can, and likely will eventually, be layered upon Bitcoin just as it is currently built on top of fiat. But importantly, such features are optional to Bitcoin users, and those that choose to opt out are not penalized by hidden costs. Even banking itself is unlikely to disappear should Bitcoin's growth continue, but it may be profoundly changed, hopefully for the better.

Let's take your friend's position and use gold when there's suddenly no electricity and Internet. How many goldbugs store their own gold? If they don't, they use some kind of a service to store their gold. Without electricity and the Internet, how does the goldbug get their gold? Unless the storage company is still using mid-20th century or older techniques, storage records, customer authentication, service payment and verification are likely accomplished electronically. Even accessing security in most facilities just to get to the gold could depend on electricity.  
Now let's assume they did store their own gold or they somehow managed to get at it during this apocalypse. How can you spend it? Even before this apocalypse hit, transferring gold requires that it be assayed and weighed. Since this is 2014, good luck getting that done without electricity.  
Of course, eventually, people would scrounge up or jury-rig the methods that were used before electricity -- fully mechanical tools, fossil fueled forges, mechanical scales, chemicals, etc. But I think in a similar amount of time Bitcoin users can restore enough electricity and networking (or radio) to get things working on a basic level.

It's almost a non-issue. Data storage costs are going down and storage capabilities are growing faster now and for the foreseeable future than the Bitcoin block chain. The entire block chain is currently less than 30 GB, and you can get a 64 GB USB FLASH drive for less than $25 USD. 6 TB drives are available at computer stores. Where this does pose somewhat of an impediment is in the adoption of full-node wallets, such as Bitcoin Core and Armory. These are the most secure forms of wallets, and when configured properly, can also contribute towards the functioning of the overall Bitcoin network. However, initial download and syncing of the block chain can take days. This is not really a problem for general users, as light (or SPV), web and mobile wallets are available that do not have this issue (but which also have more possible attack vectors -- though I've never heard of these getting exploited yet).  
The large block chain size also requires substantial network bandwidth, and available network speeds may not be growing quite as quickly. Broadband in the US in particular is not keeping up with the first-world standard in other countries. There are optimizations, such as prunable outputs that are getting worked on, though I'm not sure of an ETA for such features.

It's new, but not as new as it was five years ago. Those Bitcoin early investors bought pieces of a very risky technology bet and have absorbed five years more of that risk than people buying it today. The fact that the market for Bitcoin today values it at so much more than five years ago reflects how buyers now evaluate the risk proposition. It's still tremendously risky, but it's sure less risky now than it was before. Since this is currently the case, early buyers of bitcoin are handsomely rewarded for their correct bet, as evaluated with respect to today's market sentiment toward Bitcoin's risk going forward.

One of the advantages of both Coinbase and Circle (as well as Celery) is that these companies are based in the US, and so are subject to US laws and regulations. Therefore, you can have some measure of greater faith in the organizations. However, these same US laws and regulations have thus far prevented any significant US-based Bitcoin exchanges from starting and succeeding.  
Therefore, trading as you outlined would require sending funds to a legitimate international exchange. This typically requires a bank wire and has varying associated costs. Some exchanges also allow other deposit methods, but none will be as easy or free from fees as an ACH transfer to Coinbase or Circle in the US. The current longest-running exchanges are still [BTC-e]( and [Bitstamp]( BTC-e, in particular, is pretty murky as a company, but you are taking big leaps of faith leaving your money or coins on any foreign exchanges, so take care (just repeat "Don't get goxxed" in your head to keep yourself in the right mindset).

Is this a new install of Bitcoin Core? If so, the block chain is almost 20 GB now, so catching up could take a while (sometimes several days). You can use the bootstrap.dat method to speed this up, but the full sync will still not be instantaneous. See the text at the bottom of this page below the "You will have to be patient" warning:  
  
This BitcoinTalk thread may also be useful:  
Also, you can forward port 8333 in your router to the IP address of the computer running Bitcoin Core. This will make your instance of Core a full node on the network and allow it to get more than 8 connections. This should also speed up the syncing process while supporting the overall Bitcoin network.

Rebroadcasting the same transaction will not help. I can see the transaction in several block explorers, so it seems to have already propagated through the network well. You would need to broadcast a manually created double-spend transaction with a proper transaction fee to make any difference, and that's a pretty technical task where mistakes can be costly.

It'd be great to have articles about DACs and DAOs in Wikipedia, but they've got strict rules about sourcing material. The rules are sometimes abused in the political back and forth among their editors, but in general I think they make sense.

Mining in Bitcoin is somewhat unfortunately named. Think of it more as the process of transaction verification. It just happens that while new bitcoins are still being issued, the miner that finds a suitable block gets a reward of newly issued bitcoins along with the all the transaction fees in that block.  
Right now, the block reward is mainly composed of the newly issued bitcoins, but as these are gradually reduced and assuming Bitcoin continues to grow, the value of the transaction fees per block will become more important.  
By 2140, when there will no longer be any more newly issued bitcoins, it's anticipated that transaction fees alone will be enough to incentivize miners. To what respect this will work remains to be seen, but the self-adjusting difficulty should be able to accomodate any changes in the hash rate that result from miners leaving or joining the network.

The number of connections will gradually increase the longer your node is running. As long as you connect to more than 8 nodes, it's a sign that the proper network port is open and other nodes can establish new connections.  
I believe you can manually add node connections through a .conf file, but this isn't really necessary, and the IP addresses used would grow out of date pretty quickly.

This is blockchain.info:  
  
They're primarily a block chain explorer and web wallet provider. The resources and services they provide are extensive and sometimes even unique, including statistical charting, taint analysis, and even coin mixing services.  
However, in March of this year they suffered a lengthy service outage due to database problems. Since then, there have been many reports of service outages and erroneous data. From what I know, prior to the March issue they were a very solid service. Until they get fully squared away again, it's a good idea to cross-check any data from blockchain.info against another provider, such as blockr.io.

To clarify:
1) Most wallets are collections of private keys (or more accurately, collections of pairs of private keys and corresponding public addresses).
2) The reference wallet, formerly Bitcoin Qt, or now Bitcoin Core, is just a bunch of such pairs that are not related to each other in any way.
3) Deterministic wallets, such as Electrum and Armory, generate all their pairs from a seed or root key, and therefore you only need to backup the seed or root key once.
4) Different wallets allow you to export or access private keys in different ways. To answer your question  you'd need to specify which wallet you are using. Most users that do not deal with cold storage never handle a private key.
5) A paper wallets is a single private key/public address pair. To spend from such a private key you typically import it into a wallet such as Blockchain.info's My Wallet or Bitcoin Core/Electrum/Armory/Multibit. Once imported, the funds can be spent. If the private key being imported was considered cold storage, best practice is to sweep any unspent funds from that private key to a new, cold public address. The original private key, now empty of funds, can then be discarded.
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:40:57
4.) QR codes which represent private keys are also used in printed paper wallets. This is possible because each Bitcoin-valid private key corresponds to a public address (via the public key that pairs with this private key.) Each such pair can hold an arbitrary amount of bitcoin. Most "wallets" are collections of such private/public key pairs. In the case of a paper wallet, a single private/public key pair is in use. Normally the public address QR code is clearly visible, while the private key QR code is obscured by a fold or flap in the paper wallet. To access the funds in the paper wallet, the private key is imported into a software wallet, with the importing process made easier by scanning the private key QR code (as opposed to typing in the long alphanumeric representation.)
So when you've heard that you can buy a "Private keys qr code" it could be a transaction where someone sells bitcoin to someone else buy giving them a paper wallet containing a balance of bitcoin. Also the new bitcoin vending machines and ATMs often have an option to print out a paper wallet which typically has a private key QR code.
Because of the ease of scanning QR codes, a private key QR code should be carefully protected from any duplication or digital imaging (e.g. in a photo or being filmed by a video camera). Once someone has successfully scanned such a QR code, the balance can be imported and transferred at anytime. In fact, a television reporter doing a piece on Bitcoin once displayed a private key QR code on TV and quickly had his bitcoins stolen by a Redditor. I'm pretty sure the reporter meant to display the public address QR code instead. The Redditor offered to return the stolen coins.
5.) There's a console command to display private keys in Bitcoin-Qt, but I don't think there's a built-in way to make a private key QR code. I'm sure there's any number of web services that could create a QR code given a private key, but that's something you should never consider doing unless you can load the web page and then disconnect from the Internet before you paste or type in your private key. You'd then want to make sure your web browser cache was cleared before reconnecting to the Internet.
You really should never need a private key QR code in normal situations. The best way to access bitcoins via such a private key QR code would be to just create a paper wallet via service like [BitAddress.org]( then transfer some bitcoins to the paper wallet's public address. The paired private key QR code for that paper wallet could then be used.

If he already has bitcoins, I don't really see the arbitrage opportunity others are talking about. People are talking about MtGox or Karpeles being able to buy BTC as low as 90, and then selling elsewhere as high as 650. If there are real BTC to buy on his exchange, and if he/they are willing to play at being such unethical inside trader(s) (which is technically OK since there are no regulations), this might be possible. But if there are significant BTC liquidity issues, this can't really be done. Likewise if his personal stash of BTC offers no real arbitrage advantage.  
Of course, if it's enough, and he's willing, he could use some or all of his personal BTC to make up for any losses that occurred. If he did that, he'd go from goat to hero pretty quickly in my book.

As it is, things are so opaque there does have to be concern about their solvency.

@_date: 2014-10-26 04:22:42
I hope that before you bought bitcoin, you researched it thoroughly. Presumably, if you did so, you found it promising, but you should have also seen that historically, you need to wait at least a year to see if your investment will show returns. Holding for two years in the extreme, would be an even better benchmark.  
On the other hand, you could decide you are trying to play the market. In this case, at any point in time if you think the price will be going down, you should sell. You should then buy back at a low price when you think it will be going up. Of course, if you try to play the market and get it wrong, you could be in for dramatically more losses in a far shorter stretch of time.
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:28:31
No only is there no interest, there's nothing like FDIC insurance either. That's why some common advice given to those looking to buy Bitcoin is to not purchase more than you can afford to lose.  
Still, many were either lazy, or trying to leverage large balances to make profits off the high volatility (a risky practice in itself).
@_date: 2014-07-27 14:28:59
I think it's more accurate to say the situation you mention *can* be safe. Keylogging and rootkit malware may still be able to steal your private keys even if encrypted. Sending bitcoins via web wallets that do not hold your private keys can still be hijacked via browser malware (this can currently be avoided by only sending from private or incognito browser instances). Best practices and good digital security are important on any device storing a hot wallet. Use two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible, and do not use insecure avenues to receive two-factor notifications (such as SMS on a carrier that has poor security, or by using services such as Google Voice if 2FA is not also enabled there.)
Paper wallets created with good randomness and using proper off-line, cold techniques are very secure for large amounts and/or for long-term storage. A cold, off-line wallet that keeps private keys and only digitally signs transactions is likewise very safe. Armory, Electrum and Trezor can function in this manner.  
EDIT: Mentioned 2FA.
@_date: 2014-09-15 21:40:45
I see. I don't believe there is such a prohibition.
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:58:07
1) It's hard to say that the use of Bitcoin is inherently more secure than Paypal. I think it's more accurate to say that Bitcoin can be as secure as you make it. The security of your bitcoin is entirely in your control. Paypal controls their entire payment network, so if you join and use them, your information and account ties can be abused or compromised by anyone who hacks PayPal, by bad actors inside the network, or by corporate Paypal actions that you disagree with (chargebacks, payment restrictions, etc.) Also, your access credentials to log into your PayPal account can be stolen. With Bitcoin, once you choose to send a recipient a bitcoin payment, it does not contain any extraneous identifiable information about you or the recipient, and it cannot be altered, blocked or banned. It is also irreversible (no chargeback risk). However, since you maintain your own Bitcoin security, if you keep your private keys (which control access to your bitcoin funds) on a badly infected computer that is always connected to the Internet, your funds are at a very high risk of being stolen. On the other hand, exercising good security practices can make your Bitcoin theoretically safer than being in a bank (except for the benefit of FDIC insurance, which is infrastructure built on top of cash that already exists in regular banking, but has not yet been developed for Bitcoin). In the future, it is very likely that bitcoin banks will exist for those that would like to trust a third party to secure their bitcoin funds, but the Bitcoin protocol really allows everyone to be their own bank if they prefer.
2) There really are quite a lot, probably too many for me to remember all at one time. I think common ones are that it's immune to inflation, it's impossible to counterfeit, there are very low fees that can be optional if you are not in a hurry, it's global and borderless, it's not subject to limits or restrictions from third parties, sending vast amounts anywhere in the world is trivial, it's completely de-centralized and not dependent for its creation or implementation on third parties like banks, credit card companies or governments, it's a trusted network secured by the math of cryptography and the distributed computing power of the Bitcoin network so that no trust is required of any individual member of the network, it's irreversible, it's currently pseudonymous (full anonymity may be available in the near future) but is also capable of unparalleled financial transparency, every transaction ever made is publicly recorded in a key aspect of Bitcoin known as the blockchain, the Bitcoin system can not be controlled by any party or group but can only evolve based on consensus, and that there is a maximum limit of 21 million bitcoins which will ever exist (each currently divisible into 100 million component satoshis).
3) Brick and mortar merchants have already started to natively accept Bitcoin, and the acceptance rate seems to be growing rapidly. Bridging companies such as SnapCard already exist which allow you to buy just about anything subject to their 2% fee. And online, Overstock and Tiger Direct already take bitcoin directly, among numerous smaller online companies. Through an intermediary like Gyft, you currently can buy anything at Amazon and save 3% doing it (if you're in the U.S.)
4) The controlling factor for your bitcoin would be your wallet files and the private keys they contain. Keeping large balances in wallet files or private keys on a computer that can be compromised is very dangerous, but there are a multitude of ways to implement what's known as cold storage, where the all-important private keys are never exposed to the Internet, and thus can not get hacked or stolen in that fashion. But it is also ultimately your responsibility to keep track of all of your wallet files and private keys, back them up as you see fit, and to not lose any passwords that allow you to access them.

Litecoin in third place has about 2.74% of Bitcoin's market cap, whereas Doge in distant fifth place has about 0.47%.

I think that neglects the cost of obtaining PCBs, installing the ASICs on PCBs, obtaining PSUs, setting up the miners, having the space, energy, and Internet resources to run the huge enterprise, the ability to fly under the radar long enough run a sustained attack, and the criminal and civil liability risk your putting yourself under for tanking the business of the ASICs firm not to mention criminal charges that may apply for any double-spending you carry out.

Visa is a well established credit service. If you're friend is happy with the service he receives relative to the fees (both real and hidden) involved in using Visa, it's currently pretty hard for Bitcoin to compete.  
However, keep in mind that this is not a fair comparison. Bitcoin is a digital method of exchanging value, rather like digital cash. The accurate comparison would be Bitcoin against cash (or fiat). Visa offers services built on top of cash, and these services come at a cost to both the Visa user and to the merchants that accept Visa.  
But given this apples to oranges comparison, there are still some benefits even at this early stage of Bitcoin's existence:
1) Using Bitcoin instead of Visa eliminates the possibility of identity theft and prevents any future credit card fraud as a result.  
2) Bitcoin has an advantage in international travel when you already own bitcoins, and you find a vendor that accepts it natively, without first requiring conversion to the local fiat currency. This often saves in currency exchange rates. There is a conversion spread involved for converting between different currencies when using Visa internationally, possibly in addition to a separate fee.  
3) Accepting Bitcoin saves merchants money in fees compared to accepting Visa. Outside of the U.S., Visa's fees can be quite high. Merchants will often pass any savings on to the consumer if they purchase with Bitcoin (sometimes even offering substantial discounts).  
That said, Bitcoin's overall acceptance is still far from widespread, so realizing these advantages isn't always easy.
@_date: 2014-12-29 22:15:48
Importing a private key does not prevent the signed transaction that you already broadcast to the network from being processed. The merchant will eventually receive the funds you sent unless you successfully issue a double-spend, something that *may* be doable some percentage of the time, but only with extensive effort.  
However, in practice, most brick-and-mortar businesses will use a merchant service provider like Bitpay or Coinbase, all of which presumably take measures against zero-conf double-spending and cover the transaction for the customer should a double-spend occur.  
Even businesses that accept bitcoin directly can protect themselves from a large percentage of double-spend attempts by implementing a confidence system which watches for double-spends and monitors propagation of the original transaction across a sample of Bitcoin nodes. This confidence can reach 90+% in seconds.

Good question. Unfortunately, because Teamviewer helps you connect to computers behind a NAT without any special configuration, the attacker wouldn't even need to know the IP address of the victim's wallet-hosting PC. I can think of three possible ways this was done: 1) OP used a guest computer infected with a keylogger to remotely access the PC with his wallet, and the attacker gathered all needed Teamviewer credentials from there, 2) there's a weakness or vulnerability in Teamviewer's system that the attacker exploited, or 3) the attacker works for or otherwise already has access to Teamviewer's internal systems and gained the needed credentials from there.  
If Teamviewer keeps logs, they may have the source IP used in the attack, but a careful attacker would use one or more proxies.

I'm just not certain its as simple as that for a number of reasons. To begin with, how does a node accept or reject a connection, or even close an idle connection. In addition, most nodes already have a large number of live connections. Would a DDoS somehow force off existing working connections? If not, it would not have much of a DoS effect until live connections were released by each node and replaced by DDoS connections.  
Another reason is I recall seeing this thread recently:  
  
The original Pastebin has been deleted, but in the comments you can see that OP reported connections rising to 400. This was confirmed by some other comments, even though a few mentioned a 120 connection limit (probably the same as the 125 we're discussing here). That seems to indicate this parameter may not function as we are assuming (or that full nodes without that restriction exist). I don't believe that there were any reports of nodes crashing or memory corruption.  
Come to think of it, these reports might reflect how a small scale DDoS test might appear.

Yes, time to purchase is another complication, but again does not render the task impossible.  
On the contrary, I suspect a huge buy could very well draw the interest of speculators such that your initial $500 billion but could very well spike some in valuation. Of course, selling in one fell swoop would lead to a valuation crash. The question is, would you get $500 billion or more or less out? This is where financial instruments could be used if desired.

Bad luck on the blockchain.info try, but that's apparently how hit-and-miss their services have been since the March DB crash. They just can't seem to get their act back together. Maybe try again every month or so, they'll hopefully get things corrected eventually.  
You should be able to access your bitcoin balance with a modern copy of Bitcoin Core/Qt, but you'll have to decide if the 0.05 BTC is worth the trouble. Maybe the value will be more motivating in another couple of years, with any luck.  
You were actually right, Bitcoin Qt/Core has always had a built-in miner, but at some early point they set it to be disabled by default as it only supports CPU mining and that quickly became obsolete. Except for very early days in Bitcoin, proper mining has always taken a good amount of research and leg-work. These days, unless you get nearly free electrical power and access to relatively new ASICs, it's an expense not a profitable venture.

I would first of all distinguish between mining centralization and centralization of the overall crypto-currency architecture. However, regarding mining centralization, it is something to keep an eye on, but I also see something very different in the chart you linked. I see it showing some 16+ charted segments, each representing *at least* one separate pool. Of these, one of the largest, comprising nearly 25%, is listed as unknown which actually consists of some 40-50 *other* miners or mining pools. As a whole, seems like a pretty fair distribution that is much more decentralized than not.  
If anyone would come up with a better method of distributing mining or decentralizing the transaction verification and block chain building process, I'd be all for it. However, I'm not all that concerned with the existing system for a number of reasons, chiefly:  
1) The largest entities in the chart are all *mining pools* whose total hashing power actually consists of the assembled power of the pool members. In the unlikely event that large pools collude as bad actors, they would be unable to sustain the attack for very long. Once a whiff of impropriety reveals itself, pool members would defect from bad acting pools *en masse*.  
2) All the incentives in the mining system drive against trying to attack the network. Why would you kill the goose laying your golden eggs? You would also further risk criminal and civil legal liabilities and possible restriction or loss of personal freedom for a large part of your life to come?  
3) Even in the extraordinarily unlikely event of an *irrational* and miraculously sustained hash rate attack, the system can only be slowed or stopped, with possible small scale double-spend attempts that could just be rolled-back if a hard fork is the implemented response.  
Finally, Darkcoin's X11 hashing system, though designed to slow ASIC development, has nothing in it that inherently prevents the development of similar mining centralization should it ever achieve similar network effect as that of Bitcoin. X11 farms and massive pools can just as easily be built, just with different ASICs or customized CPUs/GPUs. With enough financial motivation, ASICs could be created for each of the round robin protocols and switched as necessary.  
And as I mentioned initially, the comparison I'm making is in the architecture of the overall network itself, not just the mining aspect of it. If Darkcoin is tied to InstantX at a low network protocol level, it is demonstrably more centralized than Bitcoin due to the inclusion of masternodes. If InstantX runs on top of Darkcoin, almost any crypto can implement it or something similar in basically a modular way.

There's nothing worse than a lukewarm paper wallet. /s  
I assume you were kidding, but in case you weren't: There's no reason paper wallets *have* to be cold. It's just that paper wallets are a convenient way to do cold storage. You can create less than cold paper wallets extremely simply by going to bitaddress.org, creating one, printing it out and funding it. The resulting paper wallet is perfectly useable, but is only as secure as the online device and printer that you created it on. If you do this process on a computer compromised by malware that intercepted the private key, any funds you send to the paper wallet could be stolen at any time. However, this risk would be similar to that for any wallet accessed using the same computer, unless multisig or 2FA was employed.  
In addition, careless use of a network printer, or leaving your printed private key image in the memory of a smart printer can also result in your paper wallet's private key being compromised.
If you believe you have decent digital security, there's no reason you can't create "not cold" paper wallets for giving small amounts to others. It would be best that the amount on such paper wallets gets swept out in a reasonably timely manner, since not taking the extra steps to make the paper wallets cold mean that leaving funds them for a long duration may not be a great idea.  
EDIT: I'm a little slow. It occurs to me that you may be serious and just not know what the term "cold" means in this sense. "Cold storage' just refers to bitcoins stored in a public address/private key pair where the private key has never been exposed to any Internet connected device. This means that theft of these bitcoin funds stored in cold storage would be impossible if attempted over the Internet.

Bitcoin is quite new and has characteristics that blur quite a few lines. Critics will say it's not real money due to its volatility or for other reasons. Personally I'm not sure *what* it is yet, exactly, but I know for sure it's not a fake in-game currency. It definitely works well as money in many circumstances, but if it *is* money, it's definitely money with, um... youthful character.  
If you delve into it, keep in mind what money is to you in the paper stuff you use every day. Then consider any criticism of Bitcoin as money, and apply the same standards to what we already use as money, as well as to money surrogates such as gold and silver. If you finally look at Bitcoin's actual properties in comparison, I think you'll be well prepared to make your own even-handed assessment.
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:52:50
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like even a lot of factual information about double-spending attacks tend to overstate the danger.  
For instance, the **Attacker has a lot of computing power** section talks about "100% rate of success" and states:  


These percentage statistics are only correct in long time scales with lots of attempts, trending towards infinite time. This conflicts with the initial assumption "... for the time that he is in control", and the fact that for *each* attempt, the attacker must make a new spend transaction that he is targeting for reversal.  
EDIT: Of course, since I know of no real non-Finney double-spend attacks that have been conducted on Bitcoin in a significant scale and for real value, we don't know how fast miners and nodes would react in such situations. IMHO, any reaction would be fast enough to make such attacks very difficult.

There are numerous reputable online wallet services you can use as long as you are clear that anyone you allow access can steal all of the funds. Coinbase may not be the best for this since you may attach bank accounts or credit cards to purchase and sell bitcoins.

It's a completely open free market that runs all the time, much like foreign currency exchanges. Therefore, nothing stops you from selling your entire position at any time. However, Bitcoin is not very liquid even on the largest exchanges, so the larger the amount you're trying to sell, the more you could drive the price down if you do it all at once via a market order. Alternatively, you could set a large limit sell order at below market value, as the Bearwhale recently did, and the order should gradually get filled.

Due to its astronomic difficulty and its continuing rise, directly mining Bitcoin is very challenging right now. To do it profitably, you'll need a lot of capital for current ASIC miners, and cheap power and overhead. Most miners find they would have been better off simply buying bitcoins instead of investing in mining.  
It might be somewhat easier mining the most profitable altcoins and converting to bitcoin. Beware, however, that ASICs are starting to enter into the picture for Scrypt altcoins, too. It's already starting to drive the rise in difficulty there just as it did with Bitcoin.  
Buying Bitcoins depends on where you reside. If you're in the U.S., your best bet is Coinbase.com .  For more complete information, check your country in this site:

Whatever strategy you decide on, make it an informed one. Familiarize yourself with the price history of Bitcoin. Bubbles seem to form and burst regularly, and the value of Bitcoin has collapsed to about 1/3 its ATH value at that point on more than one occasion.  
That said, I don't think there has ever been a point in time during Bitcoin's existence where if you bought and held for 18 months that you would have lost money.  
As always, past history is no guarantee of future returns, but being aware lends perspective. Investing in Bitcoin still must be considered enormously risky. The rote advice not too invest more than you can stand to lose should not be ignored.

1) This currently may or may not be true depending on the exact circumstances of the transfer and especially if conversion back to fiat is required at the destination. If the sender already has bitcoin and the receiver is happy to accept and spend bitcoin, then Bitcoin wins hands down. As use grows and infrastructure builds up, the advantages Bitcoin enjoys will increase, even if fiat conversion is required on both sides. In fact, it has been proposed that businesses such as Western Union should themselves adopt Bitcoin internally to reduce their own costs.  
2) Bitcoin is like cash on the Internet, and must be considered the same layer as cash. Credit cards, banking, financial institutions, purchase assurance and insured deposits are all systems built on top of cash, and these can and will eventually be built on top of Bitcoin as well. Of course, just like for cash, this will add cost and centralization to Bitcoin. But the great thing about Bitcoin is *you have a choice* on whether to accept any of these additional layers. You can still spend and transmit without any of them and save all the costs they would add if you so choose, and without the hassles of dealing with physical paper cash. At this point in time Bitcoin is nascent compared to fiat, so most of the parallel infrastructure still remains to be developed. But even as-is, businesses quickly recognize the benefits of accepting Bitcoin (i.e. lower costs, virtually zero fraud, etc.) and often pass these savings on to customers. In fact merchants sometimes offer significant incentives just to increase their Bitcoin user base (Tiger Direct's current 20% off on purchases over $100 promotion is a good example).  
3) This problem is already solved by the [Stealth Addresses]( ability of Bitcoin. This new and functional standard will soon be integrated into wallet clients.
EDIT: This does not even touch upon the other capabilities of Bitcoin which are just starting to be developed. A couple currently known ones include built-in fee-free multi-signature escrow capability without needing to trust escrow funds to a third party, and built-in fee-free notarizing capability. Much more remains to be built out based on the core Bitcoin protocol's capabilities, and then there are layers such as Colored Coins and Open Transactions and all of the capabilities those can bring.

Or perhaps you need the receiver's account to be hacked too. Then place a seemingly legitimate offshore wire request. However it's done, I'm sure banks don't want to make it common knowledge.

From what I've seen, complaints about delays sending from Coinbase to external public addresses have been fairly common, unfortunately. FWIW, internal transfers to other Coinbase addresses are supposedly better.  
I can't understand how they can expect to build their wallet business if sending attempts continue to fail in this fashion.

I second 's advice. Get familiar with all the ins and outs of paper wallet creation and where things can go wrong before committing a large amount.  
Regarding your paper wallet creation method, as long as you never, ever reconnect that old XP computer to the Internet again you should be fine. Or, if you absolutely need to use that old computer on the Internet again, you'd have to do a low-level reformat and an OS reinstall first to be sure it's safe.  
Also, if the laser printer you used has any printed document memory, make sure it's cleared before it ever gets connected to the Internet in the future.
Any wallet that can import a BIP38 encrypted private key will ask you for the password when you try to do the import.

Even without adjustments to the Bitcoin software, it seems a DoT attack as outlined here would be more costly to the attacker than to Bitcoin. If more than 7 transactions per second are available with acceptable transaction fees, miners will simply choose the highest fee transactions to include. Pretty quickly, it will be apparent what the situation is, and those that must use the network immediately during such an attack would just need to spend more in fees to outpace the attacker. Or they can just sit back and watch as the Bitcoin network absorbs new funds and wait to see if the attacker runs out.  
It's definitely a good idea to be proactive towards possible risks, but limited development resources should be sensibly assigned. I believe current transaction rates average less than 1 per second, and since even reaching the 7 per second limit would initially just serve to test Bitcoin's transaction fee infrastructure, I for one feel the likelihood of a DoT attack of this sort is not high and addressing it probably shouldn't be considered an immediate priority.  
Still, if anyone has a workable solution to put in place, all the better.

There aren't any Bitcoin accounts to be compromised or frozen. The ability to cancel fraudulent transactions is a service that is paid for by fees that is only necessitated by the fact that fraud occurs on such a large scale on conventional transaction networks.

More transactions is definitely better, but blocks are most definitely getting bigger as well (up to the 1 MB limit, or even the 750 KB limit that several pools seem to be self-imposing.) More headroom to help maintain fast first confirmations and low transaction fees is something I support, so it'd be great if consensus could be reached about how the block limit should be raised among the core developers.

I think the closest you could have is smaller denomination Bitcoin paper wallets that could get deducted and updated by merchants as they are spent. It would not be a very secure mode of operation because every merchant would need to use the private key, exposing it to loss or theft.  
As long as the value of each paper wallet is low, say the $20- $100 USD range, the associated risk may be tolerable. 
EDIT: Of course, accepting merchants would need procedures in place to scan private keys and return change back to the originating public address. I envision that an updated balance could be printed on the paper wallet each time it is used in this way until the balance is completely spent.

My reading of your statement is that it questionably ties the desire to serve the unbanked with the motivation for a meteoric price rise, which would then somehow "extract wealth from the poorest in the world". My contention is that no matter what the motivation that results in wider adoption in the underbanked, they well be greatly empowered to increase their own wealth. In fact, if the system is useful and embraced, the poor could be seen to be drawing wealth from the system, not the other way around.

There's no inexpensive way, since the considerable fraud risk must be borne by the seller and is subsidized by significant fees. The standard way to do this is via [Virwox]( here's a guide:

I thought this was likely too when I first heard about them, but they've both been operating for some time now and are doing increasing business without documented reports of excessive fraud, or any reports of law enforcement or CC companies taking legal steps against them.  
The two reasons I can think of that this might be is: 1) Actual fraud is of a manageable level, or 2) CC fraud in the industry as a whole is so rampant that the amount at Brawker/Purse.io doesn't move the needle.

It's definitely a risk that shouldn't be ignored. A lot depends on how things continue to grow and develop. An attack in a year our two could also be considerably more difficult to pull off if global hashrate continues its climb.  
In the event of a severe longer chain attack, a hard fork rollback could be implemented invalidating some or all of the attacker's mining rewards. But I don't believe there's been a Bitcoin precedence for this.

Even if everything in this article regarding taxes is true, why would it doom Bitcoin? While it would be great if Bitcoin was immune to taxes, if it's not, then it's just like anything else that can be legally profitable. In the worst case, if a Bitcoin investment made you money, you likely owe taxes. If you buy something with bitcoin, you might owe dollar equivalent in taxes assuming the value of bitcoin had gone up since you purchased it.
To me, Bitcoin was never some off-shore tax shelter, so the information presented in this article doesn't change my view that Bitcoin has a promising future.
And there is an upside. If they can tax it when it's profitable, then you can claim the tax break if bitcoin loses value.

You can always block Bitcoin by simply pulling the plug on the Internet for either the sender or the recipient. Short of that, if any legitimate Internet traffic is allowed, Bitcoin is very difficult to block. Right now Bitcoin employs no encryption, so a massive security apparatus like China's Great Firewall may be able to pick out Bitcoin related traffic and disrupt or block it.
But if you wanted to, I believe with some minor configuration Bitcoin can be run over Tor. If that is done, unless the government then only permits unencrypted data transmission, there would be no way to block Bitcoin.

First you should be clear that basically all sending and receiving of bitcoin is done from a software wallet. Wallets generally contain collections of private key/public address pairs. The balance shown by the wallet is the total of all the bitcoin contained in all the pairs stored in the wallet.
To be perfectly specific about the sending and receiving processes, you'd need to specify which wallet you plan to use. In general, though, when you create an address with a wallet, that address is for receiving purposes only. When you send funds from a wallet, the address(es) used to send the funds are selected automatically from among the balance holding pairs it contains, and the user is not typically aware of the specifics of which address(es) is/are used. So when you think about sending funds from a wallet, you typically don't think about it as sending from any specific address.

Not sure how the system you eventually select will handle it, but in theory, the owner can very easily prevent staff from sending bitcoins to their own account. Enabling customers to pay only requires receive addresses, and access to these does not enable anyone to spend or re-send the funds.

Huge fees compared to...?  
If you want to sell ("offload") bitcoin and don't mind the hassle and possible risk, many sell at substantial mark-ups via services like [LocalBitcoins]( Some even arbitrage by buying at a site like Coinbase and then selling through LocalBitcoins.
And I think you may be confusing the exchanging of a fiat currency for bitcoin with transacting with bitcoin. Sending or purchasing with bitcoin once you have it is very inexpensive (or sometimes free if you're very patient), provided the recipient accepts bitcoin for payment.  
Getting bitcoin in exchange for fiat like U.S. dollars has never been particularly inexpensive.

I'm sure there are more than I can state off the top of my head, but the major ones that occur to me involve fees and restrictions. Using eBay right now involves fees and restrictions that can be imposed by three or four parties: eBay, PayPal, a credit card company and a bank. Any of these parties can impose or raise charges or prevent your transaction entirely. If OpenBazaar fulfills its promise, you would be immune to all but transparently set fees accepted by consensus which, to start, will be dramatically less than eBay and Paypal's current 10 - 14%. You would be able to buy and sell any good or service, and your transaction could be conducted regardless of borders. You would not give up your private information or have your transactions monitored and recorded by any third-party, so you would not risk having your information compromised by improper security at a counter party. The components involved will be largely distributed and decentralized, so long-term, the service would be far less subject to downtime, attack, or maintenance. eBay and PayPal services are not available worldwide, whereas OpenBazaar and Bitcoin would be available anywhere there's Internet.

Right. I assume that's because the unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) in your original transaction were already accepted into the mempools of some miners. When your mutated transaction tries to get submitted, those miners will see the clash and reject the mutated attempt. You can only mutate *unsigned* parts of a transaction and even hope to have the mutated transaction accepted.  
I think you'll get the same error if you're submitting a transaction for the first time, but it contains already spent outputs.

Learning one or more methods of cold storage is always a good idea. If you're unfamiliar with the process, start with tiny amounts until you get comfortable.  
Whether you absolutely need cold storage depends on the amount you're storing, your confidence in your online digital security, and your risk tolerance. At 1 BTC, I think you can forgo it for now, particularly if you are reasonably confident that you don't have infections or other security holes. On the other hand, you can learn about available multisig options, such as [Bitgo]( and [Green Address]( if you have local security concerns and are not yet confident about cold storage.  
Myself, I only keep daily amounts (equivalent to how much cash you'd carry in a fiat wallet) in hot storage (generally mobile wallets like the Mycelium Android wallet). I consider live desktop wallets like Bitcoin Core, Electrum or Armory "warm" wallets as long as I'm pretty sure I don't have malware infections (I'm reasonably proficient with computer security: I scan regularly and although I'll rarely find small malware infections, I basically never let my systems get to the point where I feel I need to wipe the OS or get technical assistance to clean off serious infections -- I use M$ Windoze, but use Linux if you want to be even safer). If you are similarly confident about the computer you're running Armory on, I think you can also treat it as a "warm" and not "hot" wallet. Personally, I feel OK keeping checking account levels of value in my desktop wallet. Anything approaching savings account or investment amounts should be kept in truly cold storage. I think the new emerging hardware wallets, like [Trezor]( are good cold storage options and should be kept in mind.

Bitcoin is borderless, so transfers anywhere there's an Internet connection is trivial. The problem is whether your customers in Russia already hold bitcoins in the value needed to pay you *and* whether you are happy to receive, hold and spend bitcoins. If your customers have only RUB and need to obtain bitcoin, that's one big complication, and if you want to receive CAD that's a second complication.  
Receiving bitcoins and converting to CAD is the easier problem. Bitpay may even be able to accept the payment and instantly convert to CAD for you free of charge forever:  
  
The situation in Russia is much more difficult. If Bitcoin is not currently illegal in Russia, it is very close:  
  
Therefore, your customers would need to be willing to risk the uncertain legal environment in order to buy bitcoins and send them to you. Several exchanges apparently still provide services for Russia:

Until hardware solutions are widely available, I'd have to go with paper wallets. The concept is actually quite simple, but the process is a bit of a recipe. I'm partial to bitaddress.org, but [Safe Paper Wallet]( apparently has a pre-built offline OS that you can download and burn to CD or flash to a USB thumb drive. Ignore the kit for sale, as they're no longer sold. Just download anything you need to use for free.  
The Safe Paper Wallet page has instructions in the links.

Sure, you could do that. When you generate one paper wallet offline, the effort to create another x at the same time is marginal. You could create twenty, fund a few, and then leave the empties for use if you ever sweep one later, or if you just decide you want to fund one of the spares.

An address that has never been used cannot be traced. However, funds sent to an address, and funds sent from an address are always recorded forever in the block chain. Re-using an address results in more incoming and outgoing "trails" to trace, so always use new addresses when you can.

One minor change to what OP suggested. You may consider opening port 8333 as the first thing you do. It allows more connections to your node and would speeds downloading the full blockchain, or the final synchronizing if you use bootstrap.dat.
@_date: 2014-10-31 09:19:35
Right, my understanding as well (with a minor difference, see EDIT, below). ~~(though the effective fee is generally a little bit more than 1% for exchange, or as you put it, to get in and out of Coinbase's system)~~. Once your funds are there, transactions entirely *inside* Coinbase, from account to account, do not incur further transaction fees. As you  said, this is perfect for microtransactions, though at this point it could potentially limit your customer base.  
EDIT: Actually, I just realized, does Coinbase charge any fee to transfer funds into a Coinbase wallet from an external Bitcoin address? I don't believe they do. So their fee is slightly more than 1% for exchange, but that is *not* a fee to get funds in or out of their system.

If you are just an end-user that would like a local wallet, you can use a light or SPV wallet, such as Electrum. This does not require a copy of the blockchain and can be used immediately after it's installed.  
Bitcoin Core (formerly Qt) is known as the reference wallet. It also can function as a full node on the Bitcoin network, but this is not necessary to send and receive bitcoins and provide general wallet functionality.  
If you decide you want to run Bitcoin Core, the vast majority of the blockchain can be downloaded separately as a bootstrap.dat file on the bittorrent network. With a fast internet connection, this can be downloaded in an hour or two. The initial syncing of Bitcoin Core will take between 4 to 12 hours total using this method. Once that is done, Bitcoin Core starts much more quickly if it is used regularly.  
EDIT: I should add, though, that if all you do is download and install Bitcoin Core on a slow computer with a slow internet connection, it could take as long as you say to completely sync the entire blockchain.

What are your wife's objections? If it's the concern that Bitcoin can be used to purchase drugs, you might explain that Bitcoin is the most transparent money/payment system there has ever existed. If your son has no objection, you can simply keep track of his addresses and see any transaction that is made via the block chain.  
I'd also explain the educational aspect of being interested in Bitcoin. Your son can learn about mathematics, economics, cryptography, networking, peer-to-peer systems, micropayments, and how the open-source community works.  
Delving further, you can also mention the world-changing promise that Bitcoin holds. The majority of the world's population live in developing nations and do not have access to stable and developed financial systems. Bitcoin can provide these disadvantaged populations with the tools to economically help themselves, abilities that those that live in the first world take for granted. Everyone can be their own bank, and credit could eventually be available to all from distributed micro-lending platforms.  
Your son could learn how Bitcoin represents a powerful tool to help solve the world's widespread corruption problems. How it's already a powerful new channel for charitable giving.

You can contribute to the network itself in two ways:  
1) You can run a full node:  
  
2) You can mine on a P2Pool mining pool (do not mine on one of the major pools, such as GHash.io, as these contribute to the centralization of Bitcoin). Keep in mind that in most cases this will *NOT* be profitable, but you will be helping to decentralize the verification of transactions:

Yes, like cash, Bitcoin makes you fully responsible for your own money. When funds lost involving credit cards are reimbursed, where does the replacement money come from?

Nothing at all. Just as you would again need to trust that centralized issued IOUs are not counterfeit, or that the issuer will not run off with your bitcoins. In-person brick-and-mortar transactions for day-to-day values can be conducted with a degree of trust. If a customer is cheated, he is sure to report the vendor or not patronize the business again. Likewise vendors are sure to watch out for repeat customers that would double-spend on them for small values.  
I would say both ideas are impractical for different reasons and to different degrees. However, it seems to me that the paper wallet idea can be built on existing concepts that are already used everyday. It also has the advantage that each paper wallet is charged with a limited, standardized quantity, whereas a central issuer of IOUs would need to be trusted for holding cumulative amounts for many customers.

It depends of what level of "micro" you're referring to. Bitcoin can natively send low value transactions at very low cost over pretty much any communications channel, so I don't see why your platform would be any different. If you're talking about sending extremely small amounts, like satoshis (100 millionth of a bitcoin, the smallest current unit) with smaller than native fees, you'd need to implement what [ChangeTip]( does, but you'd have to incorporate it into your secure distributed system. Several "Bitcoin 2.0" or "crypto 2.0" systems will likely help, but none is generally available yet.

Each P2Pool node is like an individual mining pool except the node mines on the P2Pool network. If you were to run your own P2Pool node, you could also make it publicly available to others.  
No one is mining for you, though, so in that way it's not at all like a cloud hashing contract. You would contribute your own hashing power towards the P2Pool network through whichever P2Pool node your miners are connected to.  
If you did purchase a cloud hashing contract which allowed you to direct the hashing power to any pool, you could point it to a public P2Pool node and mine on the distributed network.

Bitcoin, just like any currency or item in the world is vulnerable to *theft*, it is nearly completely immune to fraud in the way the Bitcoin system functions. The way Bitcoin can get stolen by theft is just one small part of the ways in which credentials to credit/debit cards, online banking systems, and the like can be stolen. Those systems are also vulnerable to fraud through insecurities in their modes of operation, where Bitcoin is not. In a direct comparison, Bitcoin is much more secure. To merchants, it basically eliminates what they know of as "credit card fraud". This is just another expense that merchants would save through greater use of Bitcoin, and another way they can make more profits and offer lower prices.
Putting aside the PR boost and sales bump the currently using Bitcoin has been documented to provide to companies like Overstock and Tiger Direct, if reduced internal costs allow a merchant to offer lower overall prices, *that* is an economic draw in itself, and arguably, the strongest one.

Bitcoin is just a tool. Your main question is sort of like asking what's algebra's endgame? Or what's the Internet's endgame?  
If Bitcoin is found useful, it may eventually take on much of the function that fiat currency currently serves in the world's economy. However, I hope that would not necessarily instigate or require a global collapse. Any infrastructure that exists atop fiat right now can also be built atop Bitcoin, or another cryptocurrency if it were to become more successful than Bitcoin. But this should only happen if the dominant crypto was found more useful and efficient than the fiat it displaces. This should mean that the surviving crypto would benefit the world economy and serve to buttress against global collapses rather than be the cause of one.

Yes theft does occur, and we humans as a whole aren't yet as good with digital security as we are with physical security. If your Bitcoin private key(s) is/are stolen in this manner, so easily are access information to your online banking and credit card accounts. However, Bitcoin does not leak information that can be used against it in normal use. If you do keep your endpoint secure, you don't have to worry about others losing your information, or important credentials getting stolen just in everyday use like you do with credit and debit cards.  
Also, since Bitcoin is a programmable form of Internet cash, there are new innovations using mulitisignature and nLockTime capabilities that should soon be making the process even more secure, even when used in compromised environments.  
As far as protection against not getting what was paid for or receiving the wrong item, Bitcoin is like cash in that respect. Honest merchants will deal with cash purchases in good faith, and I would expect the same when Bitcoin is used. If you want more protection, there may be services in the future that offer you such protection if you want to pay for that service, *just like fees are paid for the same services with credit cards*. The only differences is, you can fully choose to purchase these services or not, whereas whenever someone transacts with a business accepting credit or debit, they are typically subsidizing those fees even if they pay with cash.

First: troll brigade alert.  
But for those new to Bitcoin, let's think about this logically. Why do banks need insurance? Why is it *legally* mandated? Clearly it's because too many banks failed or absconded with depositors funds too spectacularly. The government was forced to step in, and now we are all forced to have insurance on our accounts. As with many aspects of modern banking, the costs associated with this insurance are well hidden from depositors. Banks pay the insurance premiums, but do you think bankers are reaching down in their own pockets to pay for *your* insurance? Not a chance. The premiums come from bank fees and reduced interest payments to depositors. Every bank user is paying for this insurance, whether they ever need to take advantage of it or not.  
So is this is a situation we want to emulate with Bitcoin? I don't. There have been spectacular failures around Bitcoin, like the Mt.Gox collapse. These have all been the result of users making the choice to give up control of their own funds. They elected to trust a centralized organization, and much like in the early days of banking, it went wrong too often. I know this could happen to me if I make the wrong choice, but I choose to accept this risk as I prefer the overall freedom that Bitcoin offers. But since the world is not filled with only good, ethical and moral people, this freedom comes with immense responsibility.  
Bitcoin the currency is really closer to cash money than it is to figures in a bank's ledger or amounts on a credit card balance. Bank-like services can easily be built on top of bitcoin just like they have been with cash. In fact, some similar services already exist. If people decide they need this, and there is enough demand to amount to financial reward for service providers, solutions will develop. But with Bitcoin, these will always just be *options*, not *required*. Personally, I'd never use a Bitcoin bank because Bitcoin already gives me the tools necessary to keep my funds secure. Granting a third-party control of my funds is something that I now no longer need to do.  
EDIT: Didn't mean to imply there are *no* ethical people in the world, or that ethical folks are a minority.

@_date: 2014-11-24 18:38:39
This is an overstatement. It's not that you *can't* use Bitcoin for extremely high value transfers right now, it's the fact that the process would influence bitcoin's market price and make the task logistically difficult and not worth the trouble.  
Take buying a $500 billion company right now as a ridiculous example. The buyer would need to acquire $500 billion worth of Bitcoin. The act of buying mass amounts of bitcoin would drive up the price of bitcoin insanely, but you'd eventually end up with $500 billion worth of bitcoin (and make some entrenched Bitcoin HODLers monetarily rich beyond imagining). At this point, if the seller was happy to hold that worth in bitcoin, the transaction could be completed quickly. OTOH, complications arise if the seller would want to liquidate some large portion back to fiat immediately. If the buyer and seller make a sale requirement that the end value received by the seller *settled back to fiat is at least $500 billion*, sophisticated financial instruments may be needed to secure against volatility and guarantee this result. I suspect the cost and complications involved may negate any advantage of using Bitcoin.  
So, sure, if Bitcoin had a $20 trillion market cap, the $500 billion purchase would be much simpler, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to do today.

You may want to change your reference to the "public key" to "public address". Although it's not a big deal, the address is what you give out to receive bitcoins.

Your transaction has several complications that *require* it to have at least the recommended transaction fee to be included in a block quickly. The fee you did include is so small that it's negligible. It's possible that the transaction will still get confirmed, but it could take some time (perhaps several days). You should only ever send a transaction with less than the recommended fee if you can afford to wait.  
Read [this about how recommended fees are determined]( if you'd like to learn more. Specifically, your transaction ~~is larger than 500 bytes, has an output that is smaller than 0.01 BTC, and~~ may not have enough coin priority (based on coin age) -- ~~all of which combine to give it a recommended fee of at least 0.0001 BTC, and possibly more depending on the age of the inputs and the output of less than 0.01 BTC.~~ which means the correct recommended fee would have been at least 0.0001 BTC.  
You should probably just wait 3 or 4 days now and see if it eventually confirms. Otherwise, the next step would depend on the behavior of the wallet you sent from, and may involve manually creating a new transaction with the same inputs and outputs, but including a correct recommended fee, and then broadcasting this new transaction to the network.  
EDIT: Thanks to for pointing out I got the upper limit transaction size for a 0.0001 BTC fee wrong. It's actually 1,000 bytes, not 500 bytes.  
EDIT 2: Thanks to the "no outputs smaller than 0.01 BTC" criteria is apparently no longer relevant, and he thinks you can expect your transaction to confirm in about a day.

Those that may have benefited from Mt. Gox mishandling of transaction malleability, if there even were any, are definitely unethical if they failed to report the problem to Mt. Gox and return the extra funds. However, if you say that Mt. Gox's monumental incompetence does not rise to criminal behavior, I'm not sure I can say someone not returning extra BTC that Gox gave them are criminals either. Especially when it concerns the completely unregulated nature of Bitcoin. Of course, those that had it happen, and went on to repeat the actions to get even more free BTC from Gox are clearly criminals (if this did happen, I've yet to see blockchain evidence.)
Still Mt. Gox is the entity that was claiming fiat and BTC deposits were safe. They were the ones that, up to the moment they disappeared, continue to receive deposits from customers. To my knowledge they never disabled trading or new customer sign-ups. That is at the very least, tantamount to criminal behavior to me.

1) Fees spread among everyone are still fees. Why pay or generate fees when you don't have to? If every transaction that is currently done with credit or debit cards was done with Bitcoin, the fraud rate would basically drop to zero. This has already been demonstrated in the current larger implementations of bitcoin (i.e. Overstock, Tigerdirect, etc.).  
Friction can be defined in many ways. Fees are only one. The huge fraud departments at retailers, banks, credit card companies, police departments and legal offices could be considered another. These would get drastically reduced and resources currently devoted to this task could be directed in another productive direction. Friction also arises in the legislative and regulatory environment that has arisen around fiat, banking and credit. Bitcoin allows business and innovation to take place largely without running into the same obstacles. This serves as another potentially dramatic reduction of friction in the economic sector. Some call this innovation without permission. It's the same phenomena that occurred when the Internet first came on the scene.  
2) If you must acknowledge the current level of volatility in Bitcoin, you must also acknowledge Bitcoin's recent history. I don't believe Bitcoin will always grow as it has in past years, and I agree that past performance is no guarantee of future returns. But by the same token, existing volatility is no guarantee of future volatility. No one is forced to deal with Bitcoin's existing volatility, and yet increasing numbers of people do. Everyone must decide their comfort level with volatility (and also potential loss or gain) for themselves.

While the procedures in this video are correct as far as they go, these steps really only create "cold-ish" offline paper wallets. The problem is the procedure is entirely performed using online systems. For true paper storage, it's best to assume all systems that you are using may be compromised, and therefore do the entire procedure offline from start to finish, and leave no remnants of the process on a system that will subsequently return online. This typically involves booting to an external OS from a Live CD or USB FLASH drive.  
Unfortunately, I've yet to see a simple explanation of this complete process.

Just guesses, but perhaps it has to do with the coin age of the input or the fact that one of the outputs is on the small side. The fee you included may have fallen below the recommended fee for those parameters. Also, right now this transaction is not appearing at Blockchain.info, but Bitpay's Insight has it. BC.i has been flaky, but their "Estimated Confirmation Time" feature is somewhat useful.  
I've never sent a zero fee transaction that did not go through eventually, so yours definitely should, but perhaps not quickly. You might try pushing the raw transaction again (maybe through BC.i as well to see if it sticks).  
Did you send this through the Bitcoin Core GUI, or directly via bitcoind?

From memory, because it categorically stated the PBOC would issue an official policy prohibiting banks from transacting with Bitcoin exchanges. That article is the one that established April 15th as the deadline. The Caixin reporter cited official "sources". It was considered a reputable enough report that western major media issued reports citing this article as the source (though I suppose they are culpable for not having two independent sources before publishing.)

There have been some reported cases involving pics of forged deposit receipts, as well as even more rare instances of banks giving back deposits when a scammer gives a green teller a sob story. Definitely don't send the bitcoins until the bank reports the funds are available to you, and you may want to wait 12 to 24 hours to be certain if you are unsure about the buyer.

True, but the phone gateways are centralized, right? If dealing with legacy systems or fiat, centralization will creep in somewhere. If you're looking for pure Bitcoin solutions, I'm sure they exist at varying levels of decentralization, but I'm not familiar with specifics.

Miners will no longer earn block rewards at that point but will still earn the transaction fees for each block. There's speculation as to whether this will be enough profit incentive to keep this large a network of miners, but this should not be a problem since as some miners drop out, more transaction fees are left as rewards for those that remain. If the overall computing power of the mining network declines, the Bitcoin protocol automatically adjusts by reducing difficulty so a block is still found on average every ten minutes.

As mentioned, once your signed transaction is sent, it is basically impossible to swap addresses. The address swaps you hear about result from malware running on the bitcoin user's computer *before* the transaction actually gets created and sent. However, since digital security is so difficult for the average user, the best solution may lie in hardware wallets, of which the [Trezor]( is the first example. To this early point, the Trezor has so far shown bulletproof security at the expense of some convenience. It really is a day-to-day usable form of cold storage. If you own a Trezor and always use it for your Bitcoin transactions, you should be immune to all of the concerns you mentioned. Trezor and its competitors will continue to get safer, more convenient and cheaper as time goes on.
@_date: 2014-01-15 11:07:54
Exactly. And never disclose the private key. When you spend any coin from this paper wallet you should sweep any remaining balance to a new paper wallet. For security, the one you spent from should not be used again.

Yes, if the fee schedule does not change. There is already a change planned to implement "floating fees", which is expected to be included in the next release (version 0.10.0) of Bitcoin Core. It's anticipated that this will reduce average fees by about 10x, and from then on, fees will automatically adjust if the valuation of Bitcoin rises.

Remember, Bitpay now claims to offer 0% fees forever:  
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:45:02
The current recommend minimum transaction fee is 0.0001 BTC **per 1,000 bytes of transaction size.** If your 1 BTC transaction is composed of lots of inputs, it's possible your transaction size is more than 1,000 bytes in size, and so should have a larger than 0.0001 BTC fee.  
Transactions with fees lower than the minimum recommended amounts will still most likely go through eventually, but you may need to wait as much as a couple of days.

Most of the responses you will get are about Bitcoin's ability to store and efficiently transfer value, independent of third parties like banks or governments, irrespective of borders or geography, and with the ability to maintain unprecedented privacy.  
However, Bitcoin is the first protocol that allows distributed, verifiable, trustless consensus over an open peer-to-peer network. The ability to store and transfer value is only the first application  -- like email was on the Internet. In time, we will see that Bitcoin has allowed permissionless innovation to bloom in ways that we can only try to imagine at this point.

Full disclosure first: I've never used Bitquick.co. However, from what I've read of their process, when you want to buy, you choose a seller at Bitquick, Bitquick functions as escrow for the bitcoins, the seller then gives you a major chain bank and an account number. You then go to a branch of that bank, deposit cash equivalent to how much you want to buy into the seller's account, and get a receipt from the teller. You email an image of this receipt to Bitquick, and when the seller confirms receipt of the deposited cash, Bitquick releases your bitcoins from escrow.  
The above was just from memory, so please make sure to read the actual process at Bitquick in case I am totally wrong.

In theory, they could monitor any addresses you spend from that way, but it really wouldn't be necessary. They could capture yours as well as many others' traffic better someplace further out on the network.  
Any addresses in your wallet that you haven't spent from could be safe from snooping *if* your computer is secure on its own network. For instance, if you run a secure Linux machine (and presuming the three-letters haven't backdoored the various flavors of Linux yet). There's  also been some proof of concept done on accessing secure computers via RF methods, but this is tinfoil hat territory.  
Funds sent to cold storage through a mixing service like CoinJoin could be completely safe from digital surveillance.

A system where double-spends are impossible even a short time after a transaction is sent would be great, but arbitrarily reducing confirmation times only causes different problems elsewhere in the system to be worse. There are a lot of competing proposals to enable safer zeroconf transactions, but until consensus is reached in adopting one Bitcoin users will just need to be wary and use best practices -- early days, Wild West and all that.

If you insist on an iPhone, I'd jailbreak and use Blockchain.info for the $1,000 (Mycelium on Android). For access to the $10,000 you could use any online wallet or trusted exchange. I'm not sure how comfortable I would be having that much in an online third-party service, but maybe for a short period of time.
I believe Blockchain's online wallet stores the keys locally, though, so that would put all $10,000-$11,000 on your phone. I've also seen some complaints about delays sending from Coinbase's online wallets. I've not used them, but perhaps Coinkite or Kraken/Vault of Satoshi?
Keep in mind, if you don't want your phone to be the single point of attack, replenishing your phone should not be done via the phone. Perhaps carry a USB thumb drive with a Live CD of Ubuntu. Boot from that on any PC and transfer funds to your phone as needed that way.

Imagine you're tasked with proving bitcoins exist as a point of law. *That* would be a tough task.

If you're concerned about the fixed total amount of Bitcoin that will ever exist (21 million) relative to whatever the total valuation may end up being at some point in the distant future, keep in mind that each bitcoin is currently divisible by 100,000,000. The smallest unit right now is known as a Satoshi.  
If even that becomes cumbersome because valuations have grown so immensely in, say, hundreds of years, bitcoin can be split even further through code changes. In effect, this makes it infinitely divisible.  
Keep in mind, this is not creating *more* bitcoins, but just slicing them up even smaller. It's not like baking more pizzas, it's just making more slices of each pizza.

I even dispute that a 51% attack would kill an otherwise healthy digital currency. The effect would be short-term and much more fiscally damaging to the attacking party. It would accelerate defenses in the code by developers, making future attacks more difficult. Valuation may crash for a while and piss a lot of people off, but I can't see the benefits of the blockchain being abandoned.  
Per your argument though, healthier coins (i.e. Bitcoin) would definitely weather an attack much more easily than smaller coins like Litecoin.

If you've tested the process using offline Core/Qt and it works for you, I'd say full speed ahead. An alternative would be to keep the offline Armory cold storage, and just add watch-only public addresses to Blockchain.info as needed.

1) Any time a credit card is used is a chance for the information to be lost due to skimming, a bad actor at the point of purchase, hacking of the PoS machine used, or theft or loss at the central database. There have been well publicized incidences of theft via all of these avenues. Even man-in-the-middle attacks can steal credit card information, though I haven't heard of a publicized example of this technique. The recent huge Target breach is possibly the best example of loss due to hacking of the PoS hardware.
2) That may or may not be true. There are merchants that hold a percentage or all of their receipts in bitcoin as an investment and as supporters of the technology. In fact, there have already been reported incidences of businesses receiving payments in bitcoin and paying their staff and business vendors with it. If Bitcoin adoption continues to grow, this will only increase.  
3) It is their choice, of course. If ten vendors offer to accept bitcoin, and only one vendor passes some of the savings on to their customers, I believe this one vendor will have a competitive advantage, attract more customers, and result in more of the other nine bitcoin accepting vendors following suit.

If it continues to succeed and become more widely adopted, I think you'll see it evolve. Currently, its rapid changes in valuation make it much more appropriate to look at it as an investment.

Not sure there can be a TL;DR for this since it is likely different for every wallet (some early change address-capable clients may not even have the ability to set the change address).  
You can easily circumvent the issue by sweeping the paper wallet, then manually sending what would be the change back to the paper wallet's public address. You may choose to pay one transaction fee. Then use the remainder from your hot wallet however you see fit.  
One thing to keep in mind is, once you've swept a cold paper wallet, it's no longer truly cold, since the private key has been used on a hot (online) system.

Early on, I suspect pursuit of bitcoin thieves was hampered by a lack of law enforcement support, since Bitcoin had basically no legal status at the time. Now that this is changing for Bitcoin and other digital currencies, law enforcement should find that block chain technology coupled with subpoena power (or its legal equivalent in non-US countries) could help greatly to track down culprits. International boundaries and legal jurisdictions are likely still problems, but MtGox should prove to be an interesting test case.

Some wallets do not run properly if you try to run two instances that both hold the same set of keys, so if you transfer from the old computer to a new computer, once you make sure the new installation is working, delete or disable the old one. If you are disposing of or transferring ownership of the old computer, you should securely delete any files containing private keys (such as wallet.dat for Bitcoin Core).

I really think this is a very simple sentiment and I'm having trouble understanding what you're not understanding about it. I'll try to use some examples, though.
OP seems to be asking if Bitcoin is right for everyone. I believe, right now, it is decidedly not right for everyone. To be honest, it may never be right for *everyone*, but I also think it's evolving very fast. Check back in as little as two or four weeks, and things may have changed quite a bit. It's moving rapidly in the direction of being adoptable for a greater segment of people.
Let's take Bitcoin public addresses to start with. They are completely inscrutable. It would be as if we asked people to use email without DNS, just using IP addresses somehow. Will this improve? I think definitely so. Even now, [BIP 0070]( has been finalized and should dramatically improve things. Is it completely available now, though? And are other simplifications and abstractions in place such as easy-to-use address books with smart searching and auto-complete in address fields? Not yet.  
Right now, if you fully understand Bitcoin and are very careful with your security, your funds can be kept quite safe. But is it safe to assume that *everyone* can do this? I don't think so. And if someone is victimized by theft of bitcoin, then what? Right now, there is hardly any consensus in any part of the world as to Bitcoin's legal status, and as such, law enforcement of Bitcoin crimes basically doesn't exist.  
It's currently the Wild West in Bitcoin. Early adopters that accept the current high risk may reap high returns. They may suffer large losses. They could very well be part of a revolution the likes of which the world has seldom seen. When law and law enforcement catch up with Bitcoin, the blockchain will be indispensable for tracking down and prosecuting criminals. But right now, can *everyone* expect help if they get victimized by bitcoin theft? Not yet.
In a developing nation situation, are there many benefits to Bitcoin implentation? I think there is no question. But right now, are there massive hurdles to overcome? How do you propose that *everyone* in a developing nation exchange what currency they have for bitcoin? Does the infrastructure even exist to make this possible? Not yet.
These are just a few off-the-cuff examples, but it applies in so many more areas. Bitcoin will continue to grow, evolve, and mature, possibly quite rapidly. But if you think it is right for everyone right now, I think you're deluding yourself.
EDIT: Added a bit to the paragraph about bitcoin theft.

I don't believe these are failures but rather design decisions. Bitcoin itself is as decentralized as possible. Including the abilities of ChangeTip would sacrifice some degree of that decentralization (at least as far as I'm aware — if anyone knows of a system as decentralized as Bitcoin that can include ChangeTip's functions, please correct me). IMO far better to build your trusted foundation committed to its core principles, and then design layers on top which have added functionality, particularly if any such new functionality potentially weakens Bitcoin's essential decentralized nature.

But that's just it, for a person such as yourself the primary advantage of using Bitcoin *should* be the discounts offered for its use. This is something we are already starting to see. The reason for this is Bitcoin saves companies money. This gives the companies that adopt Bitcoin a competitive advantage. One such merchant could adopt Bitcoin, and change nothing else -- just try to derive greater profits from their savings. On the other hand, one of their competitors could decide, hey, this allows me to lower prices, I should drive my customers to use Bitcoin by giving discounts. This should win market share and save myself even more money by having an even higher proportion of my sales via Bitcoin.  
In this way, friction gets gradually reduced in the economy through the greater use of a more efficient system like Bitcoin. Free market forces mean that this will eventually benefit everyone, but since merchants save more when more of their transactions are done in Bitcoin, they have a profit incentive to offer a price advantage to Bitcoin users.  
Now, if you study Bitcoin and believe in its promise, you may decide that at this point, even if it doesn't save me money or maybe even if it costs a little more, I want to use Bitcoin to hasten this new, more efficient economy which will save everyone money in the future. That's something that most average consumers will not do. But it doesn't really matter, because Bitcoin use for merchants and companies saves them money. Therefore, adoption should come, it's just a matter of when.  
On top of this, those companies that adopt Bitcoin in the near future can still take advantage of the novelty PR that typically accompanies it. This is an advantage that will gradually diminish as Bitcoin adoption becomes more common.

Adding Bitcoin multisig escrow to a transaction is nothing like Paypal. Fees can be far lower, and if a transaction is not disputed, a third party is never involved.

I really wish I had an instant magic bullet to address this issue but I believe it's mostly a matter of time. Maturing technologies and evolving education should gradually permit more simplification and abstraction for introducing Bitcoin and its use to the average person. In the end, I can only hope that anyone will be able to hold, send, or receive bitcoin without having to give a thought to the underlying technology or security constructs involved.  
In more direct response to your initial question, I think both Bitcoin *and* digital security are naturally very complex concepts. As a result, you simply can't *prove* security to a lay person without first converting that person into someone who is at least somewhat knowledgeable about cryptography and security issues. I think it's far more realistic that Bitcoin would mature to the point that it's just an accepted and assumed service -- not unlike the AC power that comes out of a wall outlet. Few users of electricity know the intricacies of power generation, regulation and delivery, or the technical aspects maintaining a reliable electrical infrastructure. What they do know is that it's generally there, and it's usable. Therefore, they trust it. I believe for the average person, Bitcoin will need to get to this point. We can only strive to accelerate development to get there faster, but I don't know of a way to skip the hard work that will be needed along the way.

No, as an online wallet, your Coinbase wallet can send to any public Bitcoin address, whether inside or outside Coinbase. However, as a payment facilitator, Coinbase takes care of its internal transactions separately, what's known as off-chain. One thing is, in a number of ways Coinbase is suffering from growing pains. One symptom of this is I've seen reports that sending to external addresses can sometimes be delayed by hours. But Coinbase does pay the transaction fees for you.

Everything you mentioned is imposed upon Bitcoin by a system outside of it. If you want no fees and decentralization, mine your bitcoin (or provide goods and services for them) and stay within the system; then there are basically no fees at all and Bitcoin is arguably as decentralized as any money/payment system in existence. Of course, the world has caught on to the promise of Bitcoin, and can see how profitable it may be, so mining has become big business now. Unless you are an efficient large operator, chances are mining your bitcoins will cost more than getting them on the open market, even including third-party imposed fees.  
Any exchanges or brokers you may purchase bitcoins from are of course centralized. You can still go directly to peers and use LocalBitcoins or the like. Or go to a meet-up that is organizing a Satoshi Square.  
Even the transaction fee in Bitcoin is optional, but if you send a large-data-sized transaction without a fee, it may take a very long time to confirm (possibly forever?)  
EDIT: Added that you can get bitcoins without any fees by simply providing goods or services for them.

BIP38 is kind of nice in that if the encrypted private key leaks to the Internet somehow, you're still protected. You can also give out the encrypted private key to a company to make a durable version, such as being etched on aluminum. On the down side, you could lose/forget the password, and that's just like losing the unencrypted private key (unless Dave Bitcoin is able to help you).
On whether it's worth it/necessary, it's pretty hard to say. When you get to this level of care in protecting your private key you'll be hard pressed to find any actual reports of loss having occurred. Still, if you do it, it's at least marginally better than if you didn't. You also don't need to format a PC, you can just boot one from a Ubuntu Live CD and use an offline copy of bitaddress.org that's been saved to a USB FLASH drive. Just make sure when you're booted from the Live CD, there's no Internet connection while you're creating your paper wallets.
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:01:00
1) First of all, I think saying "small fee" and "tiny fee" both give a false impression. Let's use some actual numbers instead. Right now, the *optional* minimum fee for a bitcoin transaction is $0.0045. Let's take a $10 transaction just to pick a practical round number. And let's be generous and say the average $10 bitcoin transaction requires about 3x the minimum fee, or about $0.015. That makes the fee for the $10 Bitcoin transaction roughly 0.15%. I think the lowest negotiable Visa fee for a $10 transaction will not be as low as 1.5% (usually in the range 2.0 - 2.9% is more realistic, internationally often much higher). That makes the fee at least 1,000% greater for Visa than it is for Bitcoin. The fee advantage for Bitcoin only gets larger as the value of the transaction goes up.  
Why do you contend there is a risk of total failure in a Bitcoin transaction? What exactly is the nature of a total transactional failure that you are arguing could happen in the case of Bitcoin?  


The reason I stated this is because it's demonstrably true, *if* what we are discussing is only credit card fraud (or transactional fraud). It sounds like you are trying to bring in to our discussion the theft of bitcoins due to poor digital security, what you call "fraud against consumers".  
Theft of digital information (in the case of Bitcoins, the private keys which control the funds; in the case of credit cards, credit authorization numbers, codes and ID information) via those avenues (such as hacking into a consumer's personal computer) would be the same in both cases. The reason credit card losses that result from this kind of information theft is not covered at all in mainstream media is because this crime is so common that it has become an accepted part of the existing financial fabric. There is an entire fraud and reimbursement process that is included in credit card companies' normal procedures. This protection does not yet exist for Bitcoin (since it's really the same as digital cash, not entire credit service), but third-parties are likely to provide similar services in the future for a fee if the end-user so desires. The important point is that when you spend Bitcoins, you do not pass out information that can be used in ongoing fraud, like you do every time you conduct a credit card transaction. When you do pass out credit card information when you make a purchase, that information passes through many links in the processing chain, each of which is vulnerable to crucial information loss. In other words, credit card use dramatically increases the attack "surface" available to criminals as compared with the use of Bitcoin.
2) Agreed, but then it is simply a comparison of whether it is better to have credit card fees (both visible and hidden) and the cost of an exchange spread, or the use of Bitcoin which entails a very low or no fee, and possibly no exchange spread (if the merchant chooses to hold bitcoin), or a simple low fee (1%) from a PoS provider such as Coinbase or Bitpay which would then pay the merchant the fiat equivalent, completely removing any volatility concerns.  
I grant that the current problem for achieving this Bitcoin benefit on the consumer side is the low level of merchant adoption, as opposed to the existing, vast Visa network.

Two points here: First, if I didn't mention before, let me state I think this is a bit of an apples and oranges comparison. Bitcoin is like digital cash. Credit cards are a sophisticated product built on top of cash. Knocking Bitcoin for not having the same features as credit cards is very much not a level playing field. And yet, Bitcoin holds its own in a lot of respects.  
Second point: I was just trying to make the point that since Bitcoin is like digital cash, even though it may forgo some of the features credit cards afford, people make cash purchases all the time and also forgo the same protections. Besides, most reputable vendors have incentive to do right by their customers in any case.  


Mostly agree here, but I just like the fact that when used properly, Bitcoin really doesn't need those added services and can save you from associated fees. It's nice to have the option, and I envision that future service packages will provide bitcoin purchases with similar protections as credit cards, if you choose to pay for them. I didn't mean to imply escrow, however, as I don't really see it as necessary for brick-and-mortar purchases. As an aside, though, multisig should allow fee free escrow unless a dispute arises, in which case a third party settles the dispute and collects a fee.  


The aspect of risk you describe here is again the part of the risk that would be the same for credit card transactions used from those same devices. The difference is, downstream of these devices once a credit card transaction is made, there continues to be further loci of risk for each and every transaction. The same is *not* true of Bitcoin. Also, hopefully Bitcoin users would not choose to use one hot wallet accessed from many devices, but instead choose to have other hot wallets with smaller balances for travelling and spending (just as you'd never withdraw your entire savings account to shop at the local mall). In this situation, the most they would risk is the amount in their travelling wallet, whereas each CC transaction risks credit liability and fraud loss to the CC company up to the customer's credit limit.

No security is perfect against every attack, with the possible exception of truly cold storage, and that just removes the problem from the digital domain back to the physical one. However, I think the goal is to do as much as you can while preserving usability. In the case of 2FA, I see it's goal as significantly compromising an attackers ability to use stolen data at their convenience. The difference between Blockchain's implementation and those of GreenAddress and Coinbase/Circle (for example) is, if Blockchain always stores an encrypted copy of private keys locally, access and use only requires the encryption paraphrase should the attacker have system access; whereas in the latter case, the counterparty holds access to a crucial component before access to funds is available, and 2FA is a time dependent barrier to accessing this. It should be noted that in the Coinbase/Circle cases, the full private key is held by the counterparty, which is a risk proper multisig wallets should not have.

No one knows exactly what Bitcoin is yet. Considered as a pure currency, it is far too young and volatile. But it has properties and capabilities that are unique and possibly revolutionary. Since it's not a fiat currency, no one is compelled to use it, but you probably owe it to yourself to be honest about its characteristics.

You should also make sure to get the x64 version of Core if your system and OS support it. The x86 version does not run stably as a full node on one of my Windows systems, though that might be because of relatively limited resources.  
I agree it would be great if better and easier resources to run full nodes were available, but I suspect the problem itself may not really be that severe. At current usage levels there are many more nodes than are needed, and while adoption of light and other wallets is currently at least stalling node growth if not still reducing node numbers, any serious merchant or company accepting Bitcoin will likely run one or more nodes in due course. Users may also choose to start using full-node capable wallets again in the future as headers first and prunable outputs get merged. If Bitcoin continues to grow as it has in the past, any new spike will probably bring a burst of new numbers of nodes as well.  
Since you're apparently interested in running full nodes, if you're not already aware of it, keep an eye on [Conformal's alternative node implementation btcd]( The have [compiled Windows versions on their release page.]( I've read some reports that it actually runs more efficiently than the reference release, and having diversity in the Bitcoin ecosystem can only be a good thing.

I'm simply stating general principals. Supply and demand of course applies as well, as it does to all of the world's fiat currencies. But *you* are not objective if you're talking about a 15 month time horizon. If someone bought bitcoin 15 months ago, right now they would be up ~~245.2%~~ 145.2% (this includes the ~60% drop over the last 12 months). Since you don't seem to understand this, you may need to re-read the definition of "objective".  
You are now spewing nonsense. No matter how high the volatility, unless you acknowledge an overall trend, there's equal likelihood that when you go to pay rent the valuation would have risen as it would have dropped. If you *are* acknowledging an overall trend, then you need to implement a time scale. A 12 month trend would be sharply downward. A 13 month trend or longer would be quite sharply upward. Simply fact.

If the wallets are on your phone, the two-factor authentication (2FA) of Google Authenticator would not apply. 2FA only applies when some aspect of access to a Bitcoin wallet involves a third-party, like Coinbase, Circle, GreenAddress.it, etc. These are sometimes known as web wallets.

If you're goal is to obtain bitcoins, it's now very difficult if not impossible to get your bitcoins cheaper through mining than through purchasing them, selling something for them, or providing a service for them. Prerequisites if you still want to try would be extremely cheap or free electricity; a place to install miners that can tolerate heat, provide cooling, and can tolerate lots of fan noise; and patience, risk tolerance, and initial capital to invest to purchase ASIC hardware, wait for its (generally not) timely arrival, and then mine for an extended period to try to get to break-even before ever getting any profit. Just for hardware that has *any chance* to earn a profit would likely require an investment of at least $1000. You've then got to learn how to install and run the miners and how to operate them 24/7, reliably.  
On the other hand, if you're in the US, have a bank account, and don't mind giving your information to Coinbase (a US-based business funded with $31 million in venture capital), you can buy as little as $0.10 USD worth of bitcoin at about 1.0-1.5% mark-up (including spread) + $0.15 fee over current prices.

Yes, but as you mentioned, the parties to a transaction would either choose to use anonymity, in which case (if no multisig escrow is used) one party is electing too trust the other. On the other hand, prior to the transaction, either party can verifiably prove their control of a public address. This could establish their trustworthiness, and be a guarantee that law enforcement could trace them if things should go wrong. The beauty of Bitcoin is it provides the full spectrum of choices to the user between nearly full anonymity and complete transparency (that can even serve as a third ledger for accounting purposes.) But just like any useful tool, it can be misused. If it is, I don't think it is fair to blame the tool.

I've at least browsed several of these discussions, and maybe I'm just dense, but to me this doesn't seem to be a severe concern. First of all, the transition from 25 bitcoins per block to only transaction fees happens in a gradual, known, and predictable way over the next 126 years. Likewise, the amount of fees generated by the network should be visible and fairly predictable as time progresses--even more so once the self-adjusting fee mechanism gets implemented. All miners will be able to decide what level is profitable to them, and difficulty will gradually adjust. I don't see how things can ever fall off a cliff with respect to not having enough hashing ability to support the network.

One school of thought is that if you use a strong passphrase for BIP38 encryption, you can have many distributed backup copies of the encrypted wallet stored in various safe ways. Some can even be uploaded to cloud services. However, as a final backup, a single *unencrypted* copy of the private key can be kept somewhere extremely safe and secure. This guards against the case that the BIP38 passphrase becomes lost, forgotten or otherwise irretrievable.

I think one of the main reasons a standalone hardware wallet would exist is the cold protection of the private keys it contains.

Anyone can be a Bitcoin devloper, but any change to Bitcoin as a whole would need to achieve a consensus among its users (nodes and miners). Therefore, even if Satoshi Nakamoto were to return as Dr. Evil and change the code to send all Bitcoins back to him, it would affect no one until a consensus of Bitcoin users adopted his new code, basically agreeing to send him their money. How likely do you think something like this is?

I send from Core 0.9.1. If it automatically chooses my inputs, I typically get a fee required that sometimes seems as high as the old 0.8.6 fees. You can't avoid these "recommended" fees. If you enable Coin Control then select your own inputs that have high priority/coin age and result in a small transaction size, you can still send zero fee transactions. I sent one this last week that was picked up by miners within 1 or 2 blocks.  
I also understand that Blockchain.info's My Wallet let's you choose whatever fee you specify regardless of the transaction characteristics. In these cases, you can get transactions that may seem to take forever. I think if these stuck transactions have large transaction sizes and low priority, they may take more than there days. By that point the transactions have disappeared from the mempools of the miners, so if you want to continue trying with the original transactions, you'd have to manually push those transactions to the network again. Most choose to double-spend with a higher fee at this point.  
I don't know it for a fact, but I think eventually coin age/priority will increase enough to where some miner will eventually accept even the worst stuck transactions. Those that have massive transaction size are likely to be the ones with the most problems.

But one reason this isn't considered much of a problem is that to control this much power, it's generally a mining pool. Once the members of that pool see the abuse they will flee the pool quickly and the attacker no longer has the needed power to attack further, while quickly killing his mining business. The attack can only used briefly and would likely not be very profitable compared to the cost of mounting the attack to begin with.

Some banks did, but it was never established that was because of official PBOC policy. In fact, PBOC will typically issue their own official notices of policy changes. None corresponding to this one has ever been released.  
Most accounts of the bank closures I've read have some branch getting a call from higher bank headquarters informing them they are implementing the internal policy to no longer transact with exchanges. It's unclear whether it's just an internal bank decision, or whether it's a reaction to the FUD in the press, or if they actually got a back room call from PBOC ordering them to stop dealing with exchanges, but also telling them not to talk about it.  
Some contend that PBOC sometimes behaves in this less than official manner, so that they can change their mind more easily whenever they feel like it. But even if this is the case, the reporter and Caixin should now have lost some credibility as a trustworthy news source since this is a case of them apparently having been used to disseminate government propaganda.

Why wouldn't you just create cold storage paper wallets in a normal way and load them up by sending funds to their public addresses? This would be much safer.  
Qt/Core is usually a connected wallet that wants to sync its copy of the block chain with other nodes. By definition, this makes it a hot wallet in normal operation. If you really know what you're doing, I suppose it's possible to get it to generate public address/private key pairs offline, but this is not typical at all.  
Here's how you export a private key for any particular public address in Qt/Core. As far as I know, this only works for an online/hot instance of the wallet. I don't know how you can even get to the command console if your Qt/Core is being started offline. There's one substitution--where the instructions say "public key" you can enter the "public address" instead:  
  
EDIT: Once you have your private keys, one way I know to create paper wallets for them would be to run bitaddress.org offline, and paste in private keys to the "Wallet Details" tab. Although this would not result in a formally formatted paper wallet, all the info and QR codes you would need get displayed.

The consensus I was referring to is the decision to not place hardening against possible DoS attack vectors as a high priority. This was apparently a sensible decision because no DoS attacks have occurred, so developer resources were better spent improving Bitcoin elsewhere.

There was no option to send to an address or scan an address QR code?  
I hope the print-out wasn't incomplete, or that your private key won't come on the next piece of paper issued to the next customer.
Sounds like you got a regular customer service drone who was clueless when you called. If there's not another number on the paper or on the machine for a more specialized department, you might need to call back and get escalated at least to a supervisor. Have the supervisor fix things or at least direct you to someone who knows what's going on with regards to these machines. Don't let them off of the line until they tell you exactly *how* to "contact bitcoin" and what you do with that code.

Bitcoins can only be held in virtual cubby-holes in the block chain. Each of these cubby-holes is addressed with a public address to allow funds to be sent in. In order to access the funds and send them out, you need the corresponding private key.  
Therefore, the private key is the "keys to the kingdom" for Bitcoin. However since it is just a string of data, if it exists on an Internet connected system it can be stolen.  
A paper wallet is just a way to store a private key off of any system that has an Internet connection. If the public address/private key pair was also created in isolation of the Internet, a paper wallet serves as a representation of a private key that is immune from the typical avenues of theft, such as hacking, phishing, key logging, etc.  
EDIT: It can be thought of as a safe bearer bond for your bitcoins. With the added advantages that funds can always be safely added, and the balance can always be monitored.

Miners are able to set their own policies to maximize their profits from transaction fees, so should this occur, timely first confirmations will essentially be up to the highest transaction fee bidder. Low or no fee transactions will need to wait for the least congested times of the day, or if traffic is maxed 24/7, they will just not get picked up (I'm ignoring the possibility of altruistic miners).  
I'd guess the high costs to users as well as the potential profits being lost to miners would incentivize *someone* to develop and test code that raises the block size. If there's some sort of gridlock among core developers such that they're not the first to do it, economic pressure would cause others to try their own code/fork raising the block size until something sticks.

The vast majority of criminal and unethical behavior in the world transacts via fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the euro. Do you hold the same conviction that we must move away from these old, crime-facilitating monies to some sort of traceable and trackable replacement? If so, your arguments would carry much more weight for me.
If that is also your belief, I would submit that with every transaction ever made publicly recorded and viewable in the block chain, Bitcoin may be one of the most traceable and trackable currencies that has ever existed. In this respect, it may not meet your specifications exactly, but it must be seen as a huge improvement versus any existing fiat currency. That this is not yet apparent is simply a result of Bitcoin being an entity in its infancy that most legal and law enforcement entities have have not yet established rules for. Once law enforcement agencies in general begin investigating crimes involving bitcoin I believe that they will find that applying forensic accounting techniques along with standard law enforcement methods will make the block chain very useful in prosecuting crimes. At this early stage, the FBI along with the Dutch police are the only agencies I have heard of showing any understanding of or facility using bitcoin in dealing with crime, but as with all else involving Bitcoin, I expect that to change rapidly.
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:39:12
Well, that's moving the goal posts a bit from your OP, but I'll give it a shot. Keep in mind that my 'Pros' above are based on Bitcoin as it exists now, so my 'Cons' will be the same. However, Bitcoin is a young technology so both lists would be significantly different if considering a later point in time.  
1) Using Bitcoin is like living in the Wild West: there is no counterparty risk, but there's almost no consumer protection. This means you're completely responsible for the safety of your own bitcoins. Humans have been dealing with the physical security of objects (including fiat) for a long time and have a certain level of proficiency, but digital security has only become an issue since the invention of the Internet. It's a concept that's basically new to all of us and, as a whole, we suck at it right now. That's why you hear about Bitcoin getting stolen all the time (especially in spectacular examples of incompetence like MtGox).  
1a) Inherently, Bitcoin his digital abilities unlike fiat currency, but it's really an object that occupies the same financial layer. Fiat's been around for thousands of years, and has fully developed banking, insurance, credit, and consumer protection products available. Bitcoin has almost none of these at the moment. Often when fiat is compared to Bitcoin, it's ascribed with a lot of benefits that arise from the existing infrastructure built around it, and Bitcoin looks unfairly wanting in comparison. I believe similar infrastructure will be available for Bitcoin in time, but the difference is that with Bitcoin, you can always elect to do without much of it (and the associated fees) if you so choose.  
2) Bitcoin use is currently tiny, with a market cap of only about $5.6 billion USD. There are still situations that require the exchange of bitcoin for fiat. This adds cost, hassle and risk at the point of exchange.  
3) Bitcoin valuation is highly volatile, making its use as a pure currency troublesome. This is basically solved on the merchant side by using PoS service providers that immediately exchange for fiat at the cost of a fee (which is typically still less than fees charged by credit card providers.) Consumers holding bitcoin are subject to it's current levels of volatility.  
4) Acquiring bitcoin for fiat can be difficult, risky and sometimes costly. The process can also vary significantly depending on where you are.  
5) The legal status of Bitcoin is only starting to get addressed in some countries right now. For most of the planet, it's legal status is still very uncertain.  
5a) As a result, there is basically no law enforcement protection for bitcoin at this point. Therefore, bitcoin scams have flourished.  Caveat emptor. This is starting to improve now, as bitcoin laws begin to get established.  
6) Some new taxation rules (looking at you, U.S.) can be considered cumbersome.  
7) Most of the public doesn't really understand Bitcoin. There's currently a perception that Bitcoin is shady or illegal.  
8) Spending Bitcoin currently requires a computer or other "smart" device and an Internet connection. There are solutions that allow the use of older "dumb" phones with just SMS, but these services aren't widely used or available.

A handful of nations have come out with negative stances if not outright bans on Bitcoin. However, far more nations are moving towards recognizing its legitimacy by developing legal and regulatory frameworks. In fact, many countries that started with bans have begun to back away from those positions, if not reversing their initial positions entirely.  
In a world where people already have more access to cell phones than to toilets, it seems clear to me that technological impediments to Bitcoin adoption (if any) are disappearing quickly.  
While it's true that the more corrupt and dictatorial nations will have the most to lose should Bitcoin succeed, I believe it's the fact that Bitcoin is basically impossible to truly ban that will make it a powerful tool for freedom, particularly in such oppressive regimes. I can only say that I disagree in general with your premises and conclusions, but time will tell which us is closest to being correct.

As said, it can be done, but unless you *absolutely need to do this*, it's vastly safer just to send the funds to your new Electrum wallet in a regular Bitcoin transaction. One reason you may need to transfer a private key is that the associated address from Bitcoin Core is published and known, and funds will continue to be sent to it on an ongoing basis. In this case, for *only the addresses that need this special treatment*, you can export from Bitcoin Core like this:  
1. launch your bitcoin client as usual and wait for it to load the blockchain and start up  
2. click on 'help' in the menu bar (top right)  
3. click on 'debug window'  
4. select the 'console' tab  
5. type: walletpassphrase "[your walletpassphrase here]" 600  
6. type: dumpprivkey [your address here]  
7. this will return the private key, you can copy it now; ensure you clear your clipboard/history afterwards by clicking on the red minus symbol ("-") in the lower right hand corner  
8. type: walletlock  
You don't need to type the square brackets in steps 5 and 6. If you don't know the address, you can see a list of all addresses using the *listaddressgroupings* command.  
You really should avoid exporting and handling keys if at all possible, as the process is very susceptible to error and loss.  
I'm not sure about the process to import private keys to Electrum, but I imagine it's straightforward once you have the keys. It's important to remember that while Electrum's seed or 12-word mnemonic will back up all addresses created by Electrum, it *will not* backup any imported private keys or associated addresses. You'll have to keep track of and backup any such imported keys yourself.  
One final note, once you're done transferring funds from your Bitcoin Core wallet, you may as well store an encrypted copy of the final wallet.dat file someplace as insurance should you ever discover you need another address or private key from it.

Coinbase's business model is built on not holding your fiat funds, and thus they are not a true exchange. They're more of a brokerage. So on the fiat side of the equation, they try to be only a conduit for your funds, which otherwise stay in your bank account. As a result, there's no ability to leave a large amount of fiat "in" Coinbase. MtGox, like other true exchanges, must hold the fiat you want to trade in an account in their service, and thus it can be stolen or lost.
On the Bitcoin side, Coinbase will hold your purchased bitcoins until you transfer them out. If you routinely transfer your bitcoins out as soon as the purchase transaction completes, this would minimize your exposure to the possibility that Coinbase were to disappear or somehow lose your coins.
However, part of Coinbase's business is also being an online wallet, so they are attempting to build a trustworthy reputation. Considering they are reasonably transparent and based in the U.S. with substantial VC funding, they are a substantially less risky proposition than MtGox. They also have yet to establish the long history of bad behavior that MtGox had prior to its collapse. To be fair, of course, they are also a much newer company and have a shorter history to judge them by.
Other true exchanges do have the same risk exposure as MtGox. Right now, there are initiatives to press these exchanges to demonstrate more transparency. There is apparently a way for full transparency to be made available on the cryptocurrency side, whereas fiat deposits likely still will need to be verified by third-party auditors. It's clear that exchanges that can demonstrate greater transparency will have an advantage in attracting new business.
At this point using any true bitcoin exchange is risky and requires placing your faith in that organization. The good news is, several existing exchanges seem much more above-board than, and do not have the disastrous history of MtGox.
@_date: 2014-02-17 05:09:56
At this time, bitcoin is completely traceable to the point that it reaches a mixing service or cryptocurrency exchange. Once it does that it likely would still be traceable for law enforcement at that jurisdiction inside the centralized mixing or exchange service at least for some finite amount of time, subject to rules (for instance, by subpoena in the U.S.). But since rules regarding law enforcement interaction with Bitcoin have largely not yet been created, and since legal jurisdictions are easily crossed by Bitcoin and other cryptos, that's where traceability currently stops.

There seem to be quite a few reports of delays in nearly all forms of withdrawal (even bitcoin sometimes), and a lot of speculation that the funds seized by the U.S. feds have severely squeezed Gox's liquidity. Apparently, domestic Yen withdrawals through a Japanese bank account are least affected, but I assume there are the typical costs of maintaining a bank account in a foreign country, currency conversion and international transfer if you try to bring USD stateside through that route. To me, it sounds like the ~10% price difference is factoring in these difficulties/costs.

If there are bitcoins in your wallet as a result of mining, you can spend them directly at places that accept bitcoins for payment, such as Overstock.com or Gyft.com. Or you can convert the bitcoins to your local fiat currency via an exchange. If you're in the U.S., the best bet is probably Coinbase. Otherwise, Bitquick.co or the Android app Mycelium's Buy/Sell feature. Normally I'd recommend Localbitcoins, but they're having serious technical problems at the moment.

OK, I'm with you. I think the answer is pretty simple. On your "Transactions" screenshot it shows the complete purchase result from your deposit of $1,294.63 USD. That amounted to 3.56441178 BTC (so you must have bought at a price of $363.21 USD per bitcoin). You've withdrawn 1.37661409 BTC, so when your transaction completes, you'll still have 2.18779769 BTC. This amount should no longer change regardless of what happens to the price of BTC in the meantime. I hope this helps.  
EDIT: I realized there's one possible ambiguity. I should have said the 2.18779769 BTC will not change when viewed as an amount in BTC. There may be ways to view your account balance in USD. That may of course vary depending on BTC price at the time you check your balance. But the amount in BTC should not change.  
Also, I'm not clear on why your $2,500 weekly quota should have been completely used up, unless you subsequently made another purchase.

If it must be an exchange, there are basically two choices: Bitstamp if you're OK with the verification requirements, and BTC-e if you'd rather not deal with verification and you're OK with a somewhat dodgier organization that still seems to have a decent track record so far. I believe the only fiat withdrawal option is by bank wire if you're a U.S. customer at these two exchanges.
Otherwise, if you don't need the ability to rapidly make trades and to place buy and sell orders, then Coinbase as a brokerage is the best and most solid option for people in the U.S. You can purchase from and withdraw to a bank account by ACH. Just be aware that bitcoin unfriendly banks like Chase will close your account for attempting to transact with Coinbase. Once you're fully verified there's a $1,000 instant buy limit per day, and up to $50,000 daily where it will take 4 or 5 business days for the BTC to be credited to your Coinbase wallet.

Personally I never found checks nearly as convenient as credit cards, even when registers started having the ability to print amounts on blank checks. They're fiddly, there's a good bit of writing and signing involved, you have to manually update registers to make sure banks get things right, and you've got to order checks. I find Bitcoin already more convenient, and I'm hoping for significant improvements to come. As to whether it'd be enough motivation for merchants to lower prices, I have to admit that you're right so far as I don't know of any major merchant currently offering a regular Bitcoin discount.  


If convenience was a factor, pulling credit card acceptance for only taking cash and/or checks would've meant the merchant would have received fewer sales. These days the merchants wouldn't have to refuse credit cards, I'm just hoping that offering a regular Bitcoin discount will eventually mean more profit. It's the kind of win-win that could really spur adoption.

Basically, since Bitcoin is digital, it can potentially be stolen if it's on any insecure device connected to the Internet. If you practice good digital security it's less of a concern, and in most cases it's fine for day-to-day amounts. However, if you're going to store the amount you'd keep in a savings account or more, cold storage gives you a way to store Bitcoins that are completely offline and thus cannot be stolen in the fashion that you hear about in most instances of loss.

If a new user has Bitcoin during a period when the value is rising, this makes saving/investing in bitcoins attractive. Since the history of Bitcoin has mainly shown growth in value (very recent history aside), increased adoption should result in some percentage of increased holdings (or more correctly, hodlings) per new user.
Of course, past history is no guarantee of future gains, yadda yadda, so how strong this effect will be remains to be seen.
EDIT: My understanding is there are a large number of new exchanges on the horizon, and several new ones are already starting to make inroads (Kraken was apparently  in euros for the first time recently). Attempts at decentralized exchanges are also in the offing, though some unresolved questions remain as to implementation.

Once you've accessed any funds on a cold paper wallet, though, I think it's important to remember the private key is no longer "cold". That's why it's best policy if you only want to spend part of the content of a cold wallet to sweep the contents, spend what you want, then send the remainder to a new truly cold paper wallet.
EDIT: Unless, possibly you use Armory or some other system that can sign a transaction from off-line. That would retain the cold nature of a paper wallet's private key.

Bitcoin together with traditional law enforcement techniques should make catching criminals easier in most cases compared to when the same crimes are carried out for cash due to its permanent public ledger (at least until anonymizing tools like Darkwallet are ready for wide release). The problem is in most places, laws, regulations and policies have still not caught up with Bitcoin. Ironically, incidents like the collapse of MtGox are accelerating things somewhat in this respect, so right now you may as well have your friend pursue regular law enforcement channels and see if you can't get somewhere.

First, the current standard transaction fee is about 0.0001 BTC, not 0.001 BTC. Floating fees are expected to be implemented in the next reference client. This is expected to lower fees about 10x to around 0.00001 BTC initially. There is also talk of implementing a hard fork to raise the block size limit, which should also reduce fees in the short term. Longer term, these two changes could combine to keep fees automatically low as BTC valuation grows (or in fact raise fees so they don't reduce to dust if BTC valuation lowers). But the future is unpredictable, and floating fees could result in higher fees in unforseen circumstances.

For the sake of responding to your inquiry, we'd have to also put aside Bitcoin's other advantages, such as it's significant economic advantage in remittances, or the ability it has to provide banking-like services to the large portion of the world's population that is underserved by the banking industry.  
So let's restrict ourselves to the case of a developed nation, with a well-established financial system, and where most everyone has a bank account and a credit card. In this scenario, Bitcoin still has numerous advantages, but the differences are not quite as obvious:  
If you assume that the masses trust Paypal, Amazon, banks, etc., I would first examine why this is so. Sure there's credit card fraud, but consumers are safe because the CC companies cover losses, right? Banks insure accounts so if money is lost or stolen, it's reimbursed. If credit card info is lost or stolen, CC companies typically pay for ID theft monitoring services.  
This is all well and good until you start to look more closely at the situation. Shouldn't CC and other payment networks be better secured so that fraud and loss can't occur? When it does occur and I'm reimbursed, where is that money coming from? Why is bank insurance required? Is it because all through their history, banks have collapsed, or have had massive theft or fraud of customers' funds? How is the insurance system for banks paid for? If my confidential information is lost or stolen as a result of a transaction or directly from a CC company or a bank, how does that lead to identity theft? What are the costs to consumers and society of this sort of crime and the resultant fraud? Law enforcement and prosecution of these kind of crimes alone is a tremendous cost to tax payers.  
Now consider the direct costs of the credit card system, most of which are hidden from consumers. Merchants at best pay 2%-3% per transaction for accepting CCs. PoS and other required services cost more. Merchants that accept cash or credit, but only charge one price are recovering these fees from all of their customers. Cash payers are subsidizing credit card fees even when they are not using the system. And there's also the costs to consumers to use their CC's, if they apply. Annual fees, interest fees, late fees, etc., etc.  
On the banking side there are also fees, but also a whole range of costs that arise from our current fiat monetary system and the inflation that is associated with it. This makes the act of holding value have an opportunity cost, and taking advantage of this fact is key in how banks extract value from customers accounts without it being generally obvious. Banks require minimum balances, direct deposit and other requirements for the right to have an account. This requires customers to leave those amounts in banks as purchasing value shrinks. Meanwhile, taking advantage of fractional reserve banking, banks are in essence making investments that carry some amount of risk, but only placing that risk on depositors' funds to make their profits. Even the best bank customers, those that may enjoy the lowest fees and even possibly earn interest, are only receiving the returns from their funds *less* the profit and overhead taken by the bank.  
Add all these fees and costs together, and the sum is definitely non-trivial. And yet the masses may not be aware of most of it, as the costs are cleverly cloaked in the everyday economy. Still, this total cost, this friction is definitely there, placing a drag on the movement of value throughout economies even in the first world.  
Bitcoin has the ability to dramatically reduce or even eliminate these costs. This reduction of economic friction has the potential to benefit all participants in an economy, with the likely side effect of deflating the bloat from middlemen companies such as CC companies and PayPal equivalents, and taking the cost assessing ability from banks.  
More than this, though, is the benefit that comes from not being exposed to a centralized counterparty. When economic freedom is channeled through a CC company, bank or PayPal, consumers can be easily targeted as a result of political and judicial whims. It may be difficult to imagine how this might come to pass wherever you are, but for credit card users in Russia, it's a very real concern. Or you may find yourself included with a group that the government is attempting to censor or suppress. You may support Wikileaks. Or you may find your profession targeted by Operation Choke Point. Bitcoin alleviates these concerns entirely.  
Another Bitcoin benefit results from the fact that it does dramatically reduce the friction of existing financial systems, largely reducing or eliminating the barriers to entry for all small businesses and entrepreneurs. No longer do you have to sign costly contracts, or meet high minimums to accept digital transfers of value. Bitcoin's characteristic of being digital cash that's programmable will allow innovation to grow rapidly, in a permissionless way. Bitcoin will democratize and liberate aspects of the economy the same way the Internet freed communications and media from the grips of large centralized companies.  
If we move away from the initial restrictions of your question and include the rest of world's population, Bitcoin's advantages become even more glaring.  
With regards to your question of whether Bitcoin's anonymity is moot, it's important to first acknowledge that while Bitcoin is inherently excellent at protecting one's privacy, without extra effort it is not truly anonymous. In normal use, Bitcoin is pseudonymous, but every transaction ever conducted is publicly recorded and viewable in the the distributed public ledger called the block chain.  
Even better privacy capability is getting developed for Bitcoin, and it may get to the point where Bitcoin can be truly considered anonymous, but it's not yet there for most users.  
As it stands now, Bitcoin already permits its users to almost completely control aspects of their own privacy. Even in your example, services are starting to appear that will allow drop shipping. These could easily take advantage of Bitcoin's digital signing ability to allow much more private ordering of shipped items. And the authentication that might be required at every stage, for instance when going to a drop shipment locker and confirming you are the person who ordered an item, would not necessarily risk the loss of any private information.  
An even better example would be in day-to-day purchases at physical retail stores (brick-and-mortar locations). In these cases, you could have the ability to pay digitally *without* the need to show any sort of identification or provide any other private data such as account numbers and authentication codes.  
In short, Bitcoin gives you the ability to be as private as you would like to be. A capability that no current electronic payment system can match.

There have been something like three to five bubbles and crashes in the lifetime of Bitcoin that match this curve somewhat closely. However, one clear difference is that the dotted "Mean" line is significantly steeper in the case of Bitcoin. In spite of these bubbles and crashes, Bitcoin valuation has exploded over its five year history. If you bought in at the worst possible time during any one of the past bubbles, holding for only nine months would have made you whole. Holding for 12 months would have generated a strong return.

Blocks are found on average every 10 minutes. Assuming your transaction was included in the first block and that no blocks get orphaned, six confirmations will take one hour on average.  
A Bitcoin transaction can be accepted with zero confirmations (which is nearly an instant transaction), but whether that is the case or not is up to the specific recipient. If the recipient you are trying to pay specified six confirmations until the funds are accepted, then you just have to be patient until that occurs.

Bitcoin is a layer like cash is a layer. The aspect you mention of Bee and CoinKite are layers on top of Bitcoin, just like similar services for cash. It's true that opting in to these services adds centralization and requires trust, but doing so is a choice to the Bitcoin user. I don't think it hurts Bitcoin to have such choices.

According to this:  
  
Bitcoin Core, which is the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, is released under the [MIT license](
@_date: 2014-05-10 13:35:57
Blockchain.info wallet is a little different from most wallets in that it allows you to arbitrarily specify the transaction fee. Most wallets calculate a "recommended fee" that takes into account the current minimum fee structure, coin age, and transaction size. Often, this "recommended fee" is more like a "mandatory fee" (such as in Bitcoin Core, the reference wallet).  
The issue of the ability to send a zero or below recommended fee transaction that eventually does not get accepted by a miner is a known characteristic of Bitcoin. I believe Blockchain.info returns these transactions if they disappear from the network before getting accepted (usually a few days later). In practice, you can continue to push the same transaction over and over. Eventually, coin age will rise to the point where it's more likely the transaction will get picked up. Or it can just get picked up by a miner that accepts zero fee transactions by chance. I believe this is the default behavior of a wallet like Bitcoin Core.  
This is not a failure of Bitcoin, since send transactions can still complete with zero fees. I did one a couple weeks ago that was picked up within the first two blocks. The largest ever single Bitcoin send in terms of USD valuation (some $150 million at the time) was sent with zero fees.
When you write that you could have double-spent the transaction, this is true in principle, but is more difficult in practice. For instance, in Blockchain.info, once you've started a transaction, you can't try to re-spend the same coins until the transaction becomes void. You'd have to either use custom software to do this, or import the same private key into another wallet and create a transaction *using the same coins as were used in the first transaction*.

Please explain that as humans, we've always dealt with physical security so we understand it and we're reasonably good at it. We've only started to deal with digital security since the advent of the Internet, and, as a rule, we still suck at it.

As you mentioned 2-of-3 (or m-of-n) multi-signature transactions will be a big revolution in this, but this is just starting to come on the scene.

In your case, you didn't just pay extra for anonymity and convenience, but because this may be one of the only options to get coins for those under 18. As to what the point is considering the cost you incurred, you made the decision to buy, so you'll have to decide that for yourself. Hopefully, if you hold for a while, it'll at the very least serve as an inflation hedge.  
Keep in mind, Bitcoin is still in its infancy and should be considered high risk, though arguably with significant potential. It's enormous value growth over the last 5+ years as well as its significant drop since late last year both attest to this. Since you've bought in, learn what you can about it and see if keeping it as an investment is for you. If not, you can sell back at a relatively small loss and consider it a lesson learned.  
If you do decide to hold, and you haven't already, do a little research on good security practices for keeping your bitcoins safe.

If your concern is international trade, you do realize that Bitcoin is the *only* method that can be used to and from *any* nation in the world, right? Bitcoin is still young, and due to its inherent capabilities many facilities and services that have long since been built on top of cash, such as credit cards and Paypal, do not yet exist. If the need or demand arises, those services are easily applied to Bitcoin as well. However, almost all the abilities achieved via corporations like Paypal and credit card companies can already be accomplished via Bitcoin's programmable nature. Simple polished interfaces may not exist yet, but stay tuned. Bitcoin development happens fast.

It seems that I/O speeds have been increasing along with storage capacities. I haven't checked to see that they are completely keeping pace, but I wouldn't be surprised if they are growing at a rate similar to Moore's Law. Of course taking advantage of new I/O speeds would likely mean moving to new storage technologies as well.  
As far as conducting transactions is concerned, I am under the impression that the entire blockchain does not need to be accessed or scanned for new transactions or for adding new blocks. This is only needed when establishing a new node or when some data inconsistency is found.

If you're trying to pull off a transaction malleability attack, I assume you'd create both the original transaction and the mutated transaction at the same time, but not submit either. Then, when you or someone else submits the original transaction, you submit your mutated one to the network at the same time or as closely as possible afterwards. Then some miners will have the original in their mempools and some will have the mutated copy. If a miner that has the mutated copy in its mempool finds the next block, then the attack worked. But this is only a successful attack vector if the organization you're trying to attack handles transaction malleability improperly. The fix for this has been released quite a while ago.

I'd be sure to mention that the proposed law is redundant, costly, and unnecessary. Here's why: every single Bitcoin transaction that has ever happened is already permanently recorded in the central feature of Bitcoin, a distributed public ledger known as the block chain. There's no need for an added bureaucracy to record this information again, as it is already forever maintained as part of Bitcoin. Of course, the information in the block chain is pseudonymous. You can only see numbered addresses, amounts and transactions. But if you need more information, there are already facilities in our legal system to pursue that, they're known as warrants or subpoenas. Requiring further information provided to the state before any suspicion of a crime is presented is anathema to the personal freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.

I'd say in the case of traveling internationally and carrying some bitcoins and a Visa card, and then coming across a merchant that accepts both you'd have two options: 1) Pay with Visa having already paid any fees to have the service, pay the currency conversion spread and any associated foreign currency fee on that card, and subsidize the 2.0%+ fee the merchant pays to Visa, 2) Pay with bitcoin, include the transaction fee which should not top $0.015 (at current market rates), possibly subsidize the merchant's 1% fee to use Coinbase or Bitpay PoS. I'd argue that any impression that a credit card is free is a complete illusion.  


I see, that is what you mean by "risk to total failure". I don't completely agree, because I don't see this as any difference as a purchase made with cash. The merchant still may have policies in place in case of an unsatisfied cash customer, and if they don't act to make the customer happy they always risk their reputation. In such a case I don't think it would be unreasonable to expect the same policies for a Bitcoin purchase. The other guarantees of coverage due to the merchant screwing up or the customer not being satisfied are again akin to third-party services that could additionally be purchased. In the case of Visa, these services are, at the very least, getting subsidized by the fee the merchant pays, not to mention the other ways the CC company has of potentially getting fee payments from their "customers" (e.g. high interest rates on carried balances, late fees, annual fees, junk advertising, foreign exchange fees, etc.).  


As I've tried to explain, there are two areas where critical information can be stolen. For credit cards, information can be stolen once you pass it out for a transaction and anywhere along the chain of processing *for each transaction*. Credit card information can also be stolen from a home source, like getting hacked from a home computer. For bitcoins, none of the information you pass out for a transaction can be stolen and then used for ongoing fraud. Therefore the risk of information loss in this aspect is zero. The only risk for loss is from theft from a home source, for instance a home computer. The risk surface for Bitcoin is much smaller. Credit card risk increases the more you use it. The only reason you believe the risk increases for consumers on the Bitcoin side is because you are already paying for insurance to cover the greater risk of loss on the credit card side.  


I agree that adoption is growing quickly and possibly outpacing consumer adoption. But I don't think I'm mistaken that at this point there are vastly more places that accept Visa than that accept Bitcoin.  


I'd say that once someone gets into Bitcoin and holds some, they are already exposed to the risk you associate with the "consumer side". This risk is nearly the same whether they actively use it to make purchases or not (and is mitigated by how good their own digital security is). Therefore, making purchases with Bitcoin adds basically nothing further to this risk, and at the same time, it incurs none of the further risk of fraud that credit cards have from the loss of data during each transaction.

I see a second sending password as being only marginally useful, since the second password is largely the same as the primary password in that they are both static. People have the ability to change their passwords, but they seldom do. So if malware has somehow captured or keylogged information from a computer over a period of time, an attacker would likely have both primary and secondary passwords. The advantage of proper 2FA is that the second authentication factor is provided via an independent channel/device and is time limited.  
Now, you mentioned an attacker getting access to a user's 2FA through email. I see this as only a problem when 2FA is not properly set up. When correctly used, the 2FA codes, backup keys and configuration should not be accessible through the computer used to directly access the wallet. It should always be a fully independent second factor. For example, if you use Google Authenticator from a smartphone and immediately enable 2FA for your Google account, there's no reason any access or control of the 2FA should be available via the computer(s) used to interact with the web wallet.  
Blockchain's 2FA may be a special case if it always stores a file with the wallet's encrypted private keys on the local computer, as this would defeat the ability of 2FA to restrict an attacker's access to them.

If those that control the majority of the hash rate are not hostile, you fail to explain what threat such miners would present to the Bitcoin community at large.  


Miners have a strong incentive to preserve or bolster the value of the mining token *as long as they mine or hold bitcoin*, regardless of how obsolete their equipment becomes. They only lose this motivation if they completely divest, which can only happen if they have stopped mining and no longer have any way to affect the network.  


As trustless nodes in the system, all miners can do this for their own implementation regardless of centralization and whether or not they are "monarchs". Similarly, individual members of a pool are free to defect should any actions of the pool displease them.  
This all seems like normal operation of the Bitcoin network. If not considering the action of a hostile entity, I don't see that you have presented any real threat from miners, centralized or otherwise.

Most of the "centralized" wallets you refer to are still dramatically more independent of counterparties than existing alternatives.

Nevertheless, the point is *Bitcoin gives you the option to be as decentralized and protected as you want*.

1) Bitcoin is a unit of account and a store of value (although I think it's clear that Bitcoin is not yet a very *stable* store of value). Paypal is a service that depends upon fiat. You can't have or use Paypal without having and dealing with fiat at some point first, which requires working with centralized and generally onerous banks.
Looked at another way, Paypal is a service layer on top of fiat. If anyone ever sees a similar need, a similar service can be built on top of Bitcoin.
3) Paypal may have no *published* limits to send or receive, but the current record for a single Bitcoin transaction [was this one sent late last year valued at $147 million with no fee]( Trying to do the same with Paypal would run into some form of limit whether from Paypal, it's partner banks, or governments.
4) The intent was definitely to include it as a feature. For your purposes, you may not see the utility. But please remember, all the protections you mention have a cost, and are provided on top of fiat as a service layer. Bitcoin is basically in its infancy, and if the need arises, the same layers will eventually be available for Bitcoin, perhaps in new and innovative ways.
5) By programmable, I don't mean the service is programmatically interactable. I mean the unit of account itself is. As mentioned, bitcoin as a unit is like cash/fiat, but digital and on the Internet. So at the most basic level, it already has inherent capabilities that are only beginning to be explored. Many may eventually obviate the need for services like PayPal, but if not, those layers can be built on top.
6) So we agree, in basically every case, Bitcoin's fees are far less?
7) I would disagree. To get fiat into Paypal, you must provide connecting bank account information. This is just another junction where private, secured information must be provided that can leak during the process, or can be lost by the holding party once they have it (i.e. Paypal and anyone they may share your info with).
8) Whether this is entirely true or not, the question is *what can you do with Paypal*. As a service, it is a centralized point of attack and enforcement. As a completely decentralized entity, Bitcoin is free of those limitations. Centralized services built on top of Bitcoin may suffer from the same limitations, but the Bitcoin user can choose whether to accept those pluses and minuses at each turn.
9) Coinbase is a centralized exchange--another service you can choose or not to use in the Bitcoin space. So is Paypal, for that matter, but for fiat. So I guess some of the issue here is your original question is comparing apples and oranges a bit. It's just that Bitcoin's inherent nature makes it capable of much of what Paypal does without many of the limitations because it is *decentralized*. Regardless of the characteristics of BML as a service, the fact of having used Paypal as an advertising platform distinguishes it from Bitcoin.
10) Then I think we agree on this point? I did not contend that the source or destination of a transaction could not be identified, but that transactions in Bitcoin cannot be intercept or confiscated. Of course, there are already ways to increase anonymity if you desire, and further steps in this direction are being developed.
11) If you disagree, I wonder if you may be getting theft and loss conflated with fraud. In Bitcoin, if any value improperly changes hands it is basically always by theft--insecurity by the party that was in control of the private keys at the time. But there is no way to fake a Bitcoin transaction to steal product or fiat, for instance. For Paypal, or really, any system based on the old closed-network financial security structure, the information that facilitates transactions must be protected and secured to prevent someone that is not supposed to control the funds from making improper transactions (fraud). Therefore, in the old regimes, there has yet to be a system implemented which can avoid fraud *by its very nature*. Bitcoin is such a system.
Granted, since fiat is built on a system thousands of years old, banks and other organizations that must have expertise in securing funds generally do a better job than your average bitcoin user or company at this point in securing private keys. Hopefully this will improve in the Bitcoin space in the future. But if, as a Bitcoin user, you understand and take on this security responsibility for yourself, at least you are not dependant on any third party that may lose your funds (and thus require all the existing, costly protections in the fiat financial space to protect you).
12) I would say that with or without regulatory oversight, more *centralized* disasters will happen. Just this week, there have been financial disasters in the fiat realm which enormously dwarf MtGox, and they all occurred in very regulated systems.
FDIC insurance is a system that costs all depositors. If desired, a similar system will be made available on top of Bitcoin eventually. In fact, I've heard of one organization that is already working on offering it. But since Bitcoin largely allows yourself to be your own bank for the first time, opting in to such insurance would be entirely up to you.
@_date: 2014-03-24 03:40:46
There's only two things I can think of to verify that this is truly cold storage:  
1) How did you initially create the private and public pair? Did you do it entirely offline, such as booting a PC from a Live CD and using a local copy of bitaddress.org without any Internet connection?
2) Did you verify that the QR codes and character strings on the laser etched cards are 100% correct? One way to do this would be to enter or scan the BIP38 private key into an offline computer booted to a Live CD with an offline copy of bitaddress.org. Paste or type the BIP38 private key into the "Wallet Details" tab, enter the password, and make sure the public address you have been sending funds to is the same as that shown on the "Wallet Details" page.
As long as did these two steps properly, you have a true cold storage solution. Never expose the private key to any system that will become connected to the Internet, or it will no longer be truly "cold". If you want to spend any funds from the cold private key and continue to use it as cold storage afterwards, you'll need to use an offline signing method like that available through Armory, Electrum, or the debug console on Bitcoin Core 0.9. Don't ever import the private key into a live wallet unless you're willing to abandon this cold storage private/public pair in favor of a new cold pair.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:48:51
You are correct that the blockchain is a complete record of Bitcoin transactions. The problems come in the breaking of the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin, and in the international jurisdictions that Bitcoin can easily cross. The MtGox case should be interesting since the exchange itself exists within the jurisdiction that will likely be conducting most of the prosecution. The japanese equivalent of subpoena power should allow law enforcement to discover much of what went on within MtGox assuming records exist intact, however any funds that have been transferred from there to an exchange in another country could present a major road block for the further investigation of where the funds ended up.

I'd speculate existing botnets are generally set up to attack a single IP or a handful of IPs at once. Reconfiguring a zombie network to attack thousands of IPs is likely a new problem at the very least. Lacking a profit motive, hackers may feel their efforts are better spent elsewhere. And, as you mentioned, some hackers may realize attacking Bitcoin shuts off a payment channel they can otherwise utilize (Cryptolocker/Cryptowall come to mind).  
I would think the differences between how existing DDoS attacks bring down web services on a small number IPs, and how an attack would affect a network of thousands of Bitcoin full nodes over distributed IPs (with uncertainty about how even single nodes would respond under such an attack) could be quite significant.  
But I know I can't prove my contention, and so far you haven't convinced me about yours, so I'm happy to agree to disagree.

I should have added that what I wrote presumes you are using up-to-date and patched wallet software. There have been several incidents where flawed implementations result in transaction signings leaking improperly re-used components (R values). This would compromise an affected private key very quickly. In addition, if the private key itself was generated using a flawed PRNG, it is inherently much more likely to be compromised (but this aspect is not really worsened by re-using the address).

I see references to a decentralized ledger, the most recent copy of which is known as the "last closed ledger", and generally vague references that the ledger is agreed to by consensus.  
Regarding trades in fiat, correct me if I'm wrong, but trades in fiat on Ripple result in assets on the Ripple network denominated in the destination fiat, right?

My understanding is that the Byzantine Generals' problem is actually a bit broad, and there really is no standard formulation.

Bitpay is just bitcoinstore's payment processor. If you send funds from your Coinbase wallet to pay for something you buy there, it'll work fine. It never matters who your wallet provider is, or who their payment provider is, as long as sent bitcoins are received by the merchant. The only thing you may need to keep in mind is Coinbase's payments to external bitcoin addresses have been occasionally reported to be delayed as much as a few hours.  
It's best practice not to leave the bulk of your bitcoins with a third-party provider that has full control over them, like Coinbase. Although I believe Coinbase is a legit company, if they were to disappear for whatever reason, your funds would likely be gone as well. Consider moving most of your funds to a wallet where you have full control of the private keys, such as Bitcoin Core, Armory, Electrum, GreenAddress.it, Blockchain.info's My Wallet, or Bitgo.com.  
Moving some of your coins from Coinbase to another wallet would also avoid any Coinbase delays, as well (*if* they are still occurring).

OK, fair enough. I agree that stability is an important quality of a mature currency, but Bitcoin's youthful volatility does not erase it's many benefits. In fact, companies like Coinapult and Bitreserve already offer ways to lock your bitcoin valuation if you like, and other ways to mitigate volatility are being developed. Over the last 12 months the overall trend has been sharply downward, but this does not fully capture the volatility of Bitcoin in its current bootstrap phase. Spikes such as the one that occurred last November more accurately illustrate the true extent of Bitcoin's volatility, as well as it's past tendency to bubble strongly over short periods of time. However, after each such bubble or spike, the valuation has never fallen to the same level or below as when the most recent spike started. That is as true now as it has been at any point in Bitcoin's past. Whether such a pattern will continue in the future is anyone's guess, but it's far from objective to see only 12 months of history and refuse to look at 13 months worth or more.  
Since it is early days, those looking to buy and hold or invest in bitcoin should first realize that it is highly volatile and high risk. They should also be clear that although its full (if short) history is dramatically positive, it's recent annual performance was quite poor. As with any risky investment, everyone should do their own research and decide whether an investment would suit them. Those that seek to use Bitcoin now for it's innovative capabilities may expose themselves to some volatility, but this can be mitigated by performing transactions expediently, or by using the many growing service providers in the space which partially or completely remove the effect of volatility, such as Rebit.ph in the Philippines for remittance.

It is true. This is also why it doesn't matter where you download a bootstrap.dat file to speed up the first sync.

There are places that claim to pay you interest on bitcoin funds you allow them to hold ([Bitfinex]( is one), but be very careful considering them "banks".  
Most people consider banks places that are highly regulated and where your funds are possibly insured. Neither of those apply to any current organization that claims to pay interest on bitcoin. Remember, if you don't hold the private keys, you'd don't really have your funds. It's nearly impossible to prove that an interest paying bitcoin company isn't a pyramid scheme that will eventually disappear with customers' funds.  
I expect we will see firms offering secure and insured bitcoin storage *for a fee*, before there are regulated bitcoin banks that pay interest.

Quickest with no respect to cost? Maybe [COINdrip]( in the U.S., and cash out at a bitcoin ATM (e.g. Robocoin) in Canada.

That, or [Localbitcoins]( in-person cash exchanges on both sides. You'd both have to take some precautions to be sure of safety.

In order to spend from a paper wallet, you must import the private key to an online wallet. This defeats the "cold" nature of the paper wallet because any part of the online wallet system might be compromised (i.e. infected with a keylogger, etc.) Since paper wallets are so simple to create, it's just safest to use a new one each time.
In fact, you may as well create many paper wallets whenever you create one. That way, each time you spend from one, you just sweep the remaining balance to the public address of one the empty paper wallets you created before.

The vulnerability comes down to if a bad actor is able to copy/steal your private keys, passwords, and/or credentials for accessing online bitcoin services. If this critical information is stolen it would not matter if your wallet is open or your computer is on after that point.  
Windows suffers particularly due to two factors: 1) It's the most widely used operating system, and so is the most profitable for bad actors to develop code to attack, and 2) it has not proven to be a particularly secure operating system when compared with alternatives such as Linux. If you use Windows, you'll notice system updates at a minimum a few times a month. These are often fixes for newly discovered security holes. You'll notice the updates never seem to end--this is a good indication of the scale of the problem.
The best way to stay secure while using a Windows PC is to store any large amount of bitcoin in a secure form of cold storage (Trezor hardware wallets are apparently starting to ship; competitors should be available soon as well). Short of that, you must be diligent about computer security. Frequently scan for malware infections.  Educate yourself about phishing and other attacks, and learn how to avoid them. Disconnecting your PC from the Internet when not in use may provide a small security benefit.

If the wallet holds the private keys and keeps a running record of offline spends and change addresses until the next time it can sync itself, I'm not sure if there's a limit. Where it could go wrong is if offline spends do not get confirmed into the block chain quickly, but in this case the wallet could just re-transmit any unconfirmed transactions the next time it is online (this should work assuming there's no major reason the original transmission of the transaction did not get confirmed).  
Such an offline wallet would not know about any *received* bitcoin funds (outside of pending change address updates from its own offline sends) until it again gets its own Internet connection.  
EDIT: If it was an offline wallet with just one or only a few private keys, or bitcoins not well distributed among the private keys, you could run into problems if you try a subsequent offline send from an unconfirmed change address. I would think careful coding of wallets that are capable of offline spends would minimize these issues. With the upcoming "floating fees" code, there may need to be two-way communication with the point-of-sale to find the lowest fee that ensures a quick confirmation.

You're saying BC.i's code always writes a copy of the encrypted wallet to local storage? I didn't know that, and that might make 2FA basically useless in this case. Still, browser exploits aside, this makes Blockchain's wallet just as vulnerable as a local wallet like Bitcoin Core.  
If BC.i's wallet handles private key operations in RAM without writing local copies, 2FA could still be somewhat helpful, particularly in OP's case.

Definitely not the best practice, but assuming no attacking code is being hosted by BC.i, theft of the browser history copy would be the result of local malware. Good reminder, though, thanks!

In the absolute worst case situation of a hard fork and block chain roll-back, I would bet the time scale for the system to be back up would be in weeks rather than months (possibly faster).

Well if you're dead set on doing it, I guess it's a great way to test your Internet security skills. Just be aware that having a concentration of private keys and transaction activity from one IP address could make you a target for hackers.  
The initial I/O requirements can be minimized by downloading [the most current bootstrap.dat file]( from BitTorrent before you launch (assuming you are planning to run one or more instance of the Bitcoin reference wallet). After that it depends on how you are planning to implement the wallets for your friends. Personally I'm only aware of the end-user versions, of which I think only Multibit supports multiple wallets (if I'm wrong about this I hope someone corrects me). Even then, I'm not sure Multibit can isolate the details of each wallet from different users (in other words, any user can likely see the balances of any wallet). If you can get Multibit to work for your purposes, the good news is that it's a light wallet and doesn't need to download the blockchain. I think you'd find the resources required quite minimal.  
If you're thinking of hosting separate VPS instances for each of your friends, and you want to use a full wallet like the reference Bitcoin_Qt for each, once you sync a single instance of the wallet using bootstrap.dat, you could simply copy the entire Bitcoin folder minus the wallet.dat file to each separate instance. Unless you have an intelligent de-duplicating file system, though, this would require large amounts of disk space per user (25 GB per wallet to allow some room for growth). The better method would probably be to install light wallets like Electrum or Multibit to each VPS.
If you're thinking about a more full-fledged solution a la a service like Blockchain, Coinbase, our Coinkite, I suspect there should be open source code available. These type of services probably require only one synced full copy of the blockchain, but may interact with the blockchain via code that is different than that of the reference Bitcoin-Qt wallet. Never having done this myself, I can only guess at the resources required, but I'd expect a decent server could handle dozens if not hundreds of active wallets without creating too much load.  
HTH, GL.

If a central organization can handle it, is there a reason a theoretical DAO couldn't replace it? To be honest, I wasn't actually advocating that block chain technology can create an *entirely* decentralized identity verification process, but I haven't been convinced yet that it's impossible.  


Taking the idea to an extreme and assuming DNA is included as a core reference, the areas where humans must be trusted again seem to be at the edges. During collection of any initial sample, and again later when collecting a sample for comparison to verify ID. And this is only the case in the most exacting circumstances, where ID must be determined with the absolute minimum chance for error.  
Day-to-day verification use could vary completely, all the way down to confirming you're you when showing a store discount card. Each point along this spectrum of rigorousness in determining ID depends on what records can be collected at the remote location. Is a fingerprint scanner available? That could have a score for verification purposes -- not as good as DNA, but worth something. How about a webcam? Visual comparison is also worth something. Voiceprint? The ability to answer a number of questions, like you get when a web site is trying to establish your credit history? Geolocation? Any such technique or others could be used alone or in combination, and the total method could rate a certainty score. The upper bound for the score would be the case where a confirmed DNA sample could have been collected and tested against a block chain stored or indexed record. And in all of this imaginary infrastructure, I don't see where there is an absolute *need* for centralized, human authority at the center.  
I guess if some set of DACs/DAOs is managing such a web of verification, the rules they operate under would still be established by humans. That's a process that can't be perfectly decentralized, but as in Bitcoin, perhaps implementation of any ruleset modifications could be by consensus.  
And since I've mentally strolled off into fantasy-land here, I think a block chain could even help in the case of distinguishing identical siblings or clones. The time verified records in a block chain could maintain divergent health records of those with identical DNA, monitor differing gene activation, or even keep track of rates of genetic mutation.  
The overall concept is quite Orwellian, though. I know that a state having a record of everyone's DNA is a nightmare for many. Would an amorphous, decentralized entity having it instead ever be acceptable to all?

For centralized organizations that want to keep complete control, there are more efficient and possibly cheaper ways to do what the block chain does, and this is basically the model that always existed before Bitcoin. But there are clearly problems with this legacy system that have yet to be solved (i.e. security, abuse, corruption, greed, making the service available at low cost to everyone, etc.) The block chain may introduce additional overhead when compared to a simple secured database-type system, but in return it gives arguably the most security and decentralization yet achieved in a unit of account / store of value / payment network system. And because it's one of the first [Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)]( it's largely immune to the imperfections that humans introduce in legacy systems.  
There's also the consideration that anyone (especially centralized bodies) wanting build another block chain-based system would need to build their network security from zero. In this respect, Bitcoin may have an insurmountable lead.

If the integrity of the web page code stays the same, the web site/web server does *not* have access to the private key (for Blockchain.info) or seed (for GreenAddress.it). The danger is, the code for the site could change without notification, but at least the code is there for anyone to see. The only thing is, most people don't check to see if the web page's code has changed before using the site.

And also how.
@_date: 2014-04-14 12:53:50
I believe the circumstances are exactly the same in a purely cash transaction. It is always best to deal with a trustworthy party. For instance, if you buy a watch using cash from a shady dealer in a dark back alley, and the watch turns out to be defective, you can't expect much of a remedy. The same is true of Bitcoin. On the other hand, if you go to a reputable store and make a cash purchase and obtain a receipt, that store will in most cases honor their specific return policy given a receipt is produced when necessary. Again the same should apply to a Bitcoin purchase from a reputable party.  
When Bitcoin's legal status was murkier, it may have been problematic to enlist law enforcement when necessary. However, the improved legal standing of Bitcoin in places such as the US should quickly make getting legal assistance comparable to the situation for a disputed cash transaction, as well.  
Bitcoin can be as anonymous or as transparent as the two parties making a transaction choose. If you elect to make a purchase with a party that is entirely anonymous to you, caveat emptor. However, with Bitcoin's multi-signature capabilities, ensuring neither party cheats in such a transaction is simpler and less costly than in an equivalent cash situation. The buyer would just need to be certain to take advantage of the capability that Bitcoin offers.

I don't see any reason why a cold storage address can't be used for business, except that the balance is viewable by the public.  
The safest way to accept zero-confirmation transactions is to monitor the transaction's propagation over many nodes and to listen for double-spend attempts. I understand that this is the method that Bitpay and Coinbase use. The Mycelium Android wallet was to implement something similar, but I don't know if the feature is available yet. I believe it was going to show a percentage bar from 0% to 100% showing the confidence in the transaction. Supposedly most transactions reached 90% within seconds. If you could adapt that to the cold storage public address for your business, that sounds like an ideal solution.  
You may also want to look at the free blockchain.com application. I don't know how it handles zero-confirmation transactions, but it's free, so it can't hurt to look.  
EDIT: Also, for now insist on at least the old minimum fee structure of 0.0001 BTC per kB of transaction size. See here:

Like everyone will tell you, small-scale Bitcoin mining is almost a guaranteed losing proposition. But if you decide to do it anyway, I'd get familiar with the basics first. Try figuring out CPU or GPU mining:  
  
Sign up with a pool. Perhaps even spring $5 USD and get yourself a Block Erupter as a toy, and get it working:  
  
Don't do any of these things for very long, because you'd just be burning energy. Once you understand the basics, then choose some modern ASIC hardware, order it (I wouldn't recommend any pre-orders -- ASICMiner and BitMain are generally regarded as fairly reputable miner companies, but only order stock-on-hand), and give it your best shot.  
Unless you play every angle perfectly (or if you have free electricity somehow), don't be surprised if you can't break even.

Welcome! If you're new to Bitcoin, know that there is a lot to learn and approach it all gradually. If you don't know already, bitcoins are highly divisible, meaning you can buy any amount down to the minimum permitted at whatever broker or exchange you end up using. In the US, for example, [Coinbase]( will supposedly let you buy as little as $0.10 USD. Keep in mind Bitcoin is very young and must still be considered a risky investment. The standard refrain is not to invest more than you can afford to comfortably lose.  
That said, if you haven't already, take a look at the [WeUseCoins introductory video on the Bitcoin.org homepage](  
If you're interested in the technical details behind bitcoin, the [Bitcoin Under the Hood video]( will get you started.  
If you have any questions, I find the [Bitcoin.org FAQ]( is well written and pretty comprehensive.

I think Bitcoin as it stands now is already pretty amazing, but it's important to remember that in the scheme of things, Bitcoin is still in it's infancy. It's less than six years old. Bitcoin code is still in beta (although I think since Bitcoin software is financial in nature, it's being held to a high standard).  
So people in this subreddit discuss developments in Bitcoin, learn more about it, some even contribute to its development. Believers promote its growth and adoption. Real-world use of it is discovered and shared. Those that know more about it try to answer any questions newcomers may have (although, this being Reddit, tact and etiquette are not always Emily Post).  
In many ways, Bitcoin is still like the Internet was in the early '90s. Its use as an exchange of value is just the first big application on the Bitcoin network (some liken it to email on the Internet), so what you see now is likely only the tip of the iceberg. This subreddit tracks what is being developed and what is emerging. There's discussion about any shortcomings in Bitcoin, and proposed fixes are shared and debated.  
There's a *lot* of misunderstanding and misinformation about Bitcoin in mainstream media. Although the facts can be found here, as the main Bitcoin subreddit, it's often quite the echo chamber as well.
Bitcoin valuation and volatility are always popular topics, although is really the place for that. IRL meet-ups and conferences are posted, and happenings from them are shared.
And there's always the reddit memes and humor. And the trolls.  
There are times when there is actually quite a lot of news in the Bitcoin world, and this place is always on the front lines.
It really is what you make of it. Hang around and see if anything catches your interest.

And how much electricity and resource is dedicated to existing banking infrastructure? did some calculations on this about 3 months ago:  
  
And that analysis still neglects the excess physical resources the existing financial system requires when compared to Bitcoin mining, and the energy costs and resources therein. The cost of the infrastructure and energy to deal with credit and debit card fraud in the legal system. To deal with Identity Theft. The energy and resources used in marketing and advertising, staff healthcare and HR. There's probably a lot more, but those are the ones off the top of my head.

In terms of running a full node helping the community, my understanding is that most if not all full-node bitcoin software has the capability to mine, but that that option is off by default--see the note below). Even if your full-node is not mining, though, it is still helping to distribute and update copies of the full block chain to other peers on the network--so running a full node always serves this network function, if no other.
(Note: Even if you turn the mining capability of a full-node on, it mines stand-alone by default, so realistically the chance of it finding a block in your lifetime are pretty small by today's ASIC standards.)

Thanks for clarifying, I think I'm following you now.  
For cold storage, I still think single keypair paper wallets are useful and common. I believe this is why the general advice for spending from such paper wallets is to sweep their entire balance. Before they are spent from, the public address of such a paper wallet's keypair can still be used to receive unlimited transfers/deposits.  
EDIT: One disadvantage of multiple deposits to an unspent single keypair paper wallet is that the total balance and all the deposit activity can be seen by anyone in the block chain.

I've heard of one report of a possibly corrupted wallet.dat file causing a loss of private keys. I don't know if that incident resulted from an attempt to download the blockchain from scratch. I personally suspected hardware failure of some kind for that problem, but I had no way to verify it.  
I've never heard of a risk specifically associated with downloading the blockchain with a non-empty wallet, but the safest way to proceed would be to simply make a backup copy of the wallet.dat file before starting any major new process, such as re-installing the client or downloading the blockchain from scratch.
When I have just a wallet.dat file that has a non-zero balance, but no up-to-date installation of Qt, I install a fresh installation of Qt, download [the most current bootstrap.dat file from jgarzik's Bitcointalk thread]( place that file in the Bitcoin folder, then start Qt, allow it to create a new empty wallet.dat, import blocks from the bootstrap.dat, re-scan, and fully sync. Then I close the client and replace the new, empty wallet.dat with a copy of the wallet.dat that has a balance. I'll then launch Qt from a command line using the "bitcoin-qt -rescan" command. It'll take a while to finish the re-scan, then you should be good to go, and the correct balance should appear in the client.
If anything goes wrong, simply try it again (or try a different procedure) using a fresh copy from your backed-up wallet.dat file.

If you have confidence in your computer security, even hot wallets are not unsafe. If you encrypt, you're way better than cash. I'm not sure why you believe that anything that is not "cold" is completely unsafe. That's just not the case. It's a complete spectrum of possible security, but at this early stage in Bitcoin's history, you as the bitcoin holder must avail yourself of all the protection at any point along the spectrum from hot wallet to cold.  
And if you give up control of your funds by giving the private keys or sending the funds to someone else, like MtGox, there is currently no protection in place for this. But the legal landscape is already changing, and insurance is even starting to become available.
I think five years after the invention of cash, security and legal options weren't as far along as they already are for Bitcoin.

OK, can I assume you used the Custom Send function? If so, when you preview the send, there's an "Advanced" link. If you click that, it shows the transaction hash.

You can create another Custom Send that may be similar, but it will not be guaranteed to have the same hash as the original.

The vast majority of other crypto-currencies or altcoins can be considered forks or clones of Bitcoin, where the major concepts are very similar, but components or parameters are changed (e.g. proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work, or scrypt algorithm instead of SHA256).  
Ripple, however, is not one of these. Whereas Bitcoin strives to be as decentralized as possible, and builds a trusted network out of nodes which *do not need to be trusted*, Ripple is explicitly a semi-distributed network composed of varying trust relationships. Also, where Bitcoin never had any distribution of coins except via its mining algorithm (i.e. Bitcoin was not pre-mined), all of Ripple's 100 billion XRP were initially delivered to private parties. A tiny portion have since been given away for free or sold to the general public, but the vast majority are still held by these original centralized parties.  
Viewed in this way, Bitcoin is nearly a polar opposite of existing centralized, legacy banking and financial systems. Ripple, while new, is a much smaller step away from such past systems and will basically remain controlled and dominated by bodies that have varying levels of centralization, and which must be trusted in different ways to use the system. Also, distribution of XRP will always be at the whim of the initial large holders. The planned methodology of distribution has so far proved to be quite opaque and seems to have lead to some original founders breaking away and creating the very similar [Stellar](  
In terms of architectural flaws of both, it's hard to say, as often one man's bug is another man's feature. Basically, comparing Bitcoin and Ripple is rather like comparing apples and oranges.
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:44:09
It's like cash on the Internet. It can't be counterfeited and it does not rely on a central issuing body like a government or the Federal Reserve. You can send any amount anywhere on the Internet in a short period of time for very low fees. It's borderless and it operates on a trusted network that does not require any member of the network to be trusted. Therefore, the network itself is open to all. It does not involve credit and can't be charged back.
*EDIT:* There's a lot more to it, but this is a start.

I'd say there's another point: it doesn't matter how efficient a centralized solution is when those who control such a solution can place an arbitrary mark-up on the service.

@_date: 2014-09-22 05:17:33
Bitcoin is completely open source, so although there are some common procedures and processes that are typically followed by the usual core developers, anyone at all can make changes to the code. The issue is, only changes that most Bitcoin users choose to adopt become part of Bitcoin going forward. This is part of the democratic nature of Bitcoin, as changes require consensus.  
For example, I could arbitrarily decide to edit Bitcoin code to issue another 21 million bitcoins, and I start to run this new code. Before I can transact bitcoins with my new code, I'd need to convince some number of other Bitcoin users to also adopt it. Realistically, for the change to "take", the number would need to be a majority. Obviously, other Bitcoin users would realize their bitcoins are worth more if they do not use my code, and just stick with the existing software. Therefore, I've made a change, but no one else adopted it and it would never really be part of Bitcoin.  
On the other hand, if Bitcoin's value increases in the future to the point that each individual satoshi is worth too much or, say, microtransactions, someone could edit Bitcoin code to increase the number of base units, say, by 32x. This increases the number of slices per pizza while not increasing the number of pizzas, so to speak, and it makes Bitcoin more useful while not affecting the value of a single bitcoin. Such a change would likely be adopted by all Bitcoin users who see the need and find the change useful. If those adopting the new code are a majority, those who stayed with the old software will eventually find their legacy coins can't be used in most situations, and will basically need to switch to the new code to maintain the usefulness of their digital currency.  
But the currently allotted 2.1 quadrillion satoshis seems to be more than enough for the foreseeable future.

I agree, but perhaps, as a small positive sign, Bitcoin at least has a bit of a head start if online purchasing does increase, as it will not have to contend with an entrenched credit card user base. As internet penetration grows, I expect the legitimate uses of online purchases without COD will become apparent.  
In many ways, these obstacles may be similar to what is faced by Bitcoin in Japan. In both cases, the market characteristics may delay adoption, but I don't think they'll prove insurmountable.

Bitcoin's end-to-end cryptography already enables keeping the private keys of the person sending bitcoins safe, at least with regards to sending the transaction itself. The digital security of the electronic system storing the private keys is another matter. When I refer to more mining hash rate making Bitcoin more secure, it's only in that it makes double-spends and transaction obstruction via controlling large amounts of mining power more difficult.  


Using a block chain-based proof-of-work crypto-currency like Bitcoin, you really can't achieve all aspects of this security *without* an enormous distributed mining hash rate. This is why it does not make sense for them to use a block chain, as they are not interested in the decentralized nature of the system to begin with. They would be much better served modernizing their existing systems to leverage cryptography, encryption, etc. To avoid needing all the Chinese miners, just avoid the block chain.  
The problem is, even if they are able to build a centralized system that is more efficient and less costly than Bitcoin, they are still saddled with the existing physical corporate and banking infrastructure to support their systems. The need to pay for that infrastructure *and* to make a profit inevitably leads to high costs passed on to consumers. And centralized systems always make a bigger, juicier, and easier target for hackers to attack, as a recent [JP Morgan admission will attest to.](
@_date: 2014-12-30 17:17:35


Umm, no I would not agree with that. Two of the articles referred to in my linked comment involved banks whose poor security systems were at least partially responsible for customers' losses, yet they successfully weaseled out from paying anyway in court. If you think banks and credit cards will pay out for *any* losses they're involved with, you probably should take a dose of reality.  


If I do, it's completely by my choice and by my specification. It's not forced upon me by mandate where I'm required to subsidize other customers' and the organization's own negligence and ineptitude. If banks are supposed to be so safe, why is insurance mandated anyway? If Bitcoin offers another option that is inherently so secure that I can be comfortable to some level with my own security practices and thereby reduce or eliminate my dependence on insurance, so much the better.

I thought it was interesting and I'm sure I don't yet fully understand it, but from what I've observed it seems to be stagnating recently. Perhaps if it gets a significant second wind it can show some promise.  
Beware that the market cap for XRP is very deceptive. They control exchange valuation by limiting release, but the total cap is calculated by that value times the total quantity. This includes the pre-mined amounts that have never been released to the public. If significant amounts of the pre-mined stores are released, valuation would tank.

Sounds like you understand correctly. Just to be sure, because Armory is a deterministic wallet, what they call the "root key" is like what other deterministic wallets call the "seed". Just keeping that safe allows you to recover any balances in addresses that were generated by that instance of Armory. Of course, imported private keys are *not* generated by Armory, and that's why they need separate backup. Good luck!

Assuming sender and receiver are both in the US, I believe the receiver can just sign up for Bitpay's free forever merchant service. My understanding is individuals can do this, but do your own research on their terms of service to make sure.  
The sender would need to purchase $400 worth of bitcoin, probably from Coinbase, but Circle would be better if the sender has an invite. All the AML/KYC verification processes would need to be completed. If Coinbase is the option used, and the sender does not have level 2 verification for the instant buy feature completed, four business days worth of volatility would need to be tolerated.  
The receiver would then generate a request for $400 payment in the Bitpay interface, and the sender would send that amount in bitcoin. Bitpay would then deposit the equivalent fiat into the receiver's bank account via ACH at the end of the day. The receiver's bank would likely impose the standard ACH delay before the funds are available for use.  
If Circle is used for purchasing, the only costs would be the difference in exchange rates used by Circle relative to that used by Bitpay, along with any volatility that occurs during the process of executing the transfer. If Coinbase is used, there is a small fee plus a roughly 1% spread based on Coinbase's exchange rate. If Coinbase instant buy is not used, it's anyone's guess how four business days worth of volatility would affect the outcome.  
EDIT: As points out, if both sender and receiver are in the US, there are much more direct and cheaper ways to send $400 USD. One method he didn't mention is a USPS Postal Money Order sent via snail mail. This would only cost $1.25 and a postage stamp. However, if $400 of value in bitcoin is acceptable to the receiver and the sender already has the amount of bitcoin needed, sending bitcoin (and spending it directly by the receiver) is much faster and nearly free.

Glanced through the responses here, so apologies if it's already been mentioned, but bitcoin is generated at a controlled rate known to everyone until there are a total of 21 million units, at which point there will almost certainly be no more issued ever. This is substantially different from a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, where the Federal Reserve can print more at its whim.

First, credit card companies are very good at playing the game of hiding the costs they impose in the general economy. Why do they offer such seemingly great incentives? Because they want to retain you as a customer, since you make them money. They don't have to pay out all of the incentives they offer, because only some portion of their customers will be able to capitalize on all (or any) of them. Meanwhile, they are collecting varying amounts of fees and charges from a large proportion of their cardholders while charging all of their participating merchants. Most merchants charge their customers a single price, which means that even if you *don't* use a credit card at those businesses, you are still subsidizing the fees for those that do. Bitcoin has the potential to significantly reduce or eliminate all of this economic friction, and stop the feeding of bloated corporations that have exhibited notoriously poor performance in eliminating fraud and in protecting customers' private information.  
Second, Bitcoin is more comparable to cash than it is to the feature set that credit card companies represent. Because Bitcoin is still a young, emerging entity, companies do not yet offer credit card-like systems on top of it, but this does not mean it's not doable. However, because Bitcoin is inherently a payment system and can already provide many banking functions, the driving incentive to create such companies is somewhat reduced. When such services are available for Bitcoin, they'll be fully optional, and fee structures will likely be far more transparent.  


You may think this is the case, but this might be because you're not taking into account how the fees and fraud losses merchants must bear translate into higher prices for almost everyone. Only those businesses that charge a separate cash-only price reveal this impact to customers.  
Also, if your credit card company is anything like the ones I've done business with, you're required to jump through a lot of hoops to be signed up for all of their incentives, to comply with all of their restrictions, and to avoid all interest charges and fees. Slip up even a little, and the costs are substantial.  


I like freedom of choice. I don't like being saddled with higher (possible) fees and interest along with assuredly higher prices to subsidize the losses which result from the negligence of other customers or of the credit card company itself, just so I can use an electronic payment system. Bitcoin offers an option that is open, borderless, restriction-free, and available to anyone. Services similar to those offered by credit card companies can be built on Bitcoin, and likely will emerge in time. But you'll never be forced to pay for those services if you don't want them, and you'll still always be able to use Bitcoin's low-cost and secure electronic payment system regardless.

1) Allows consumers to be their own bank.  
2) Allows consumers to spend bitcoins without divulging critical information that can be later used to commit fraud.  
3) Bitcoin reduces friction and cost in the economy. To be competitive, merchants and service providers will need to pass that savings on to bitcoin users.  
4) Bitcoin is borderless.
5) Bitcoin is usable/accessible 24/7/365 with no counterparty risk.  
6) There are far fewer limits on sending and receiving bitcoin than for virtually all fiat equivalents.

One thing to keep in mind: most miners are still running on pre-0.9.0 code. As a result, they're still looking for minimum transaction fees of at least 0.0001 BTC as opposed to the new 0.00001 BTC minimum allowed in the 0.9.0 and newer wallets. Set a fee of 0.0001 BTC or more and you should see your transactions confirmed in much earlier blocks (if the recommended fee is more, set it to the recommended amount or more).

I second in that Bitcoin just exists. There's no central body to have a goal.  
However, in response to your other statements and questions, I think the developers of Bitcoin code want to make it as useful possible. If it helps in any use-case, that's an accomplishment met.  
Why exactly do you think that it cannot replace fiat due to its deflationary nature? I'm not saying Bitcoin will replace fiat, I just don't see why it can't be a substitute as a deflationary unit of account.
You ask if "it's goal" is to be a conduit for dollar-priced transactions, a replacement for paper currency, or a store of value. Again, "it" can't have goals because there is no central party setting a strategy. It can perform the functions you mentioned, and it will likely do a better job at each as it matures, but Bitcoin is not trying to be anything other than what it is: a revolutionary protocol or tool. It's sort of like asking what's the goal of the Internet.  
The capabilities of bitcoin as digital cash on the Internet is just the first, most developed "app" on the Bitcoin network/protocol. As it currently stands, you can send any amount (including extremely large valuations) anywhere on the Internet regardless of borders, very quickly, with extremely low fees, over a completely decentralized open network that does not require that any member of the network be trusted. It's already clear that it can do things that were more difficult or impossible before it existed. It's there as a resource and it can't be uninvented.  
Use it, or don't. "Bitcoin" as an entity doesn't care one way or another.

If you definitely want to send your funds directly to a cold storage paper wallet, carefully write down your public address and private keys by hand.

If you're not confident in your digital security, there is some validity to your concerns that a local computer-based wallet *might* be less secure. Of course, you can secure your computer with a password, just like your phone, but if you have a malware infection on either your mobile or computer, your coins can be stolen.  
The advantage of a web wallet, like Blockchain.info, is the possibility of using two-factor authentication (2FA). If you aren't currently using this, you should definitely set it up. Two good 2FA apps are Google Authenticator and Authy. 2FA by SMS instant message is typically also available, but may be less secure. You don't want your 2FA device to be the same as the device you use to send bitcoins.  
For a local wallet, like Electrum, the first and probably best defense would be to use it on an operating system that is not as vulnerable to attack, and that means Linux. Microsoft OS's are the most vulnerable and the most targeted by hackers. Apple OSX is significantly better, but still targeted (Apple users tend to spend more and have more disposable income, hackers know this). The general thinking is, if you keep your computer secure, mobile OS's are newer and less hardened for possible vulnerabilities.  
For a couple of coins, I suggest looking into a multisig web wallet like [GreenAddress]( or [BitGo]( as these should be equally secure from local or mobile as long as 2FA is used.  
For amounts closer to what you might keep in a savings account or more, some form of cold storage is best. A hardware wallet like a [Trezor]( might be simplest. Or you could look into cold paper wallets, or offline signing computers running Electrum or Armory.  
EDIT: I should mention the although digital security is a concern for local wallets, the advantage to them is you depend less on centralized third-party providers to access your funds. If Blockchain.info's website goes down, it makes it hard to access your funds. In this respect a full-node capable local wallet like Bitcoin Core or Armory is the most decentralized, but also the most resource hungry and arguably the least user friendly. Electrum is a lightweight compromise in that it also requires server support for some functions, but at least anyone can run an Electrum server.

First, you do know that the chances that you are going to make a profit are basically zero, right? If you're going to mine, you should plan on it being a hobby that will actually *cost* you money. Things move fast in Bitcoin, and if you're reading materials about mining online that are six months or more old, that info is horribly out of date.  
That said, you need to mine with a reasonably sized pool to see any returns at all in reasonable time frames. I've never heard of btcmine.com, but if you look at this chart:  
  
they're non-existent with respect to pool size, so they likely would not find blocks for long periods of time. You should try a reasonably sized pool. P2Pool is always the first recommendation. You can pick one that you like from here:  
  
Or Slush's pool is a decent one:  
Some like BTC Guild. If you don't want to contribute to mining pool centralization, maybe steer away from the biggies like GHash.IO.  
Remember, don't expect net profits, but mining can still be interesting to play around with, and you'd contributing to the Bitcoin network even if it is in an insignificant way.

1) You may not consider identity theft serious, but I for one would like to minimize my risk to it as much as possible. I'm sure many share my opinion. In almost all brick-and-mortar transactions, a Bitcoin transaction would not need to share any identity information, whereas every brick-and-mortar transaction with Visa would.  
2) That's why I specified that the traveler would need to own bitcoins already, and that the vendor would need to accept bitcoins as payment. This way there is not a single spread for exchange involved.  
3) If more than one vendor in a niche accepts bitcoin, pressure to remain competitive should compel them to pass some portion of their savings on to customers. If only Visa is accepted, this is never the case.

Don't be concerned, as long as you sent to the public address provided by the program, your transaction should be confirmed and safe in the block chain. Just make sure to save and backup your wallet.dat file before doing anything else.
Once you do this, you can even uninstall and reinstall Bitcoin-Qt to another location that has at least 25-30 GB free (good to have some room to grow). Alternatively, you can start using one of the lite wallet alternatives, Electrum or Multibit which require much less disk space (though if you do that, you'll have to read how to import the Bitcoin-Qt wallet.dat into those systems).
If you stay with Bitcoin-Qt, once you re-install it where you want it, just replace the newly created wallet.dat with a copy of the one you backed up. Then start the wallet program from a command line with "bitcoin-qt -rescan". Once the block chain is fully synced, which may take a day or more, you'll see your balance in your wallet.
If you want immediate verification of the transaction, just look up the public address you used at [blockchain.info]( or another block explorer.

I don't know how many ways I can explain that a decentralized system like OpenBazaar would not put you at the mercy of policies set by any company or organization of any sort. This is absolutely one benefit that not eBay nor any of its competitors could ever provide. With regards to fraud protection, OpenBazaar will make it unnecessary with built-in multi-signature escrow (which is free from fees unless a dispute arises) as well as a reputation system for buyers, sellers and arbiters. Those that don't care about decentralization will still seek OpenBazaar simply for drastically lower fees or the ability to sell items that can't be sold on eBay. The distinction between countries and "important countries" is exactly what decentralization can help eliminate, and while OpenBazaar cannot by itself fling open closed borders it absolutely will not help maintain them and has the potential to present a new free-market pressure to the most closed nation-states.  
I don't claim that Bitcoin offers complete anonymity. In fact striving for complete anonymity with Bitcoin is *much* harder than operating completely transparently. This is largely irrelevant to Bitcoin and OpenBazaar's benefits. I never claimed Bitcoin transactions cannot be monitored, though with simple best practices, such monitoring can be quite difficult. This is also largely irrelevant to the advantages that Bitcoin offers.  
Coinbase is not Bitcoin, but it does represent an excellent example of the freedom of choice Bitcoin provides. Coinbase offers useful services for which you must accede to their operating in compliance with US laws and regulations. But using Coinbase is *entirely optional*. Don't like Coinbase's policies? Don't use them. In basically all existing markets right now, if you want electronic payment capability, you're saddled with the baggage that comes along with credit card companies. Bitcoin represents an emerging choice, and an avenue towards far greater financial freedom.  
P.S. If you truly think what Coinbase is doing is more intrusive than Paypal's policies, I think you need a reality check.

Once you backup the seed, it also means no further wallet backups will necessary in the future. All private key pairs including any change addresses created by the deterministic wallet will be created from the seed.

OK, so you're saying an attacker at BC.i is selectively hosting bad code to steal a wallet *sometimes*, but most of the time sends innocuous code. I suppose that's possible, but personally it seems tinfoil hat territory to me.  


Well, that means BC.i's backup by email system is flawed, not that 2FA offers no protection. User's that disabled the backup by email option from the start may still be safe.  
If BC.i's claims about their functionality are true, the only place the un-encrypted backup files can originate from is the user's browser. It is particularly bad practice that this functionality is enabled by default, but the theft still does not happen at BC.i's end, but via an exploit on the user's computer or somewhere out on the Internet.  
If you turn off BC.i's backup by email feature and use 2FA, do you know of another systemic vulnerability?

You do understand the difference between fractional reserve banking where only about 8 to 11% of fiat currency exists as physical money, and full reserve where all the listed units are always available, right? Bringing in the fact that the value of units may crash is an absurd misdirect.  


"Free and easy" is listed under "Transportation." Miners have nothing to do with transporting Bitcoin, only in transacting with it. *And* in transacting, users are optionally charged a mining fee, typically about $0.03, currently. Miners *choose* to mine for their own reasons. Their expenses are not the expenses of those holding or transacting with bitcoins.  


Potentially vastly more efficient than legacy systems when all true infrastructure costs are considered.  


?  


Granted, this can be interpreted in various ways, but an optional $0.03 USD transaction fee regardless of amount transacted or destination seems cheap to me.

The public address and private key are related through the math of cryptography. You don't need a network connection to make the association. So now if anyone sends funds to the public address from the paper wallet you just created, those funds are only accessible with the private key which you created offline.
The cool thing is, even though this is a cold storage paper walllet, you can *add* funds to it at any time.  
EDIT: Just make sure you never expose the private key from the paper wallet to any Internet connection or computer that is sometimes connected to the Internet until you are ready to sweep out the funds for use in a hot wallet.

Yes, that might be an area of concern, but I'm not sure it's the main issue. If we assume that there's not yet much adoption of Bitundo or replace-by-fee, it's basically about transactions that may be getting rejected by miners. Right now, the largest crack in the dam seems to be the 0.9 version fee reduction.  
It seems to me that with proper and fairly extensive checks by the PoS systems, zero-confirmations can still be accepted with some confidence. However, existing PoS systems may not perform enough checks.  
It's clear that there's a lot of room for improvement. The current methods employed will constantly need to adjust criteria based on miner behavior. In addition, if Bitundo or replace-by-fee begin to get adopted, current zero-confirmation verification systems get further weakened.

The best solution for you might be a hardware wallet, but there's expense and right now even the Trezor is not quite ready for prime time (it still depends on a single web service).  
Otherwise, you're going to have to do some research to choose the best option for you, and practice with small amounts to get proficient with your chosen cold storage method.  
None of this has to happen all at once. A good first step might be to install the Windows version of [Electrum]( on your computer, set it up, and then send your bitcoin balance from Core to one of your new Electrum addresses. After that, you can backup your last Core wallet.dat file, then uninstall Core.  
Once you've done that, you'll have a wallet in Electrum that doesn't need to sync and that is similar to Core in basic security. You can then investigate cold paper wallets, Electrum's offline signing solution, learn about multisig web wallets with two-factor authentication (2FA), etc., to decide which solution immune to keyloggers (and other similar attacks) is for you.

You said:  


I believe you meant difficulty, and to be clear it will not necessarily only increase over time. The difficulty is in fact periodically adjusted with the goal of making sure a block is found on average every 10 minutes.  
Although the predominant trend is that difficulty mostly increases, in a situation such as at one of the reward halvings, miners may calculate that their efforts are no longer profitable and cease their mining efforts. If enough miners drop out so that the overall hash rate dips significantly, the difficulty would actually be adjusted *downwards* so that each block is still found in an average of 10 minutes.  
EDIT: When there are no longer any block rewards, it is presumed that the volume of Bitcoin transactions will be significantly higher than it is now, making the transaction fees per block much more substantial. In addition, bitcoin valuation is also likely to be significantly higher. However, even if these assumptions are wrong and many miners stop mining because of the lack of reward, the difficulty will self-adjust downwards until it is profitable enough for some miners and blocks are still found every 10 minutes (on average).

It's true, you've got to get your hardware from somewhere, but you'd have to get your bitcoins from somewhere too if you were buying in a large block. My thinking is you could spread out the mining hardware purchases, and much could be purchased for cash or bitcoins. But you're definitely right that the more state-of-the-art the equipment you're trying to get, the harder it would be to get it anonymously.  
Assuming you can get some hardware, though, the resulting mined bitcoins would be inherently anonymous. If you bought a large amount of bitcoins instead, most likely they'd come with some traceable transaction history.

I can't entirely agree with your contentions about fractional reserve banking. It seems to me that abuse or over reliance of the FRB system and the loose credit it can provide may be rapidly inflating a global debt bubble that could be on the verge of imminent collapse.  
That aside, even if we assume what you say is true and FRB can provide all these benefits. If there was no need to fund fraud protection, more returns would be available for other things, say, for example, paying interest returns to customers.
Let's be clear, Bitcoin is not MtGox, and even if it was, its failure does not hold a candle to the utterly massive banking fiascos and collapses we have seen in the last few years alone. Can you point me to one example of a failure of Bitcoin's inherent security (i.e. counterfeiting, corruption of the public ledger, a transaction that was intercepted and fraudulently modified, etc.)? Basically all current losses of bitcoin involve theft of private keys (which would be the equivalent of having cash stolen itself), or the choice of the bitcoin holder to give up control to a third-party they chose to trust.
Bitcoin is five years old and serves as the equivalent layer of cash in the existing financial system. All of the banking and insurance features you seem to tout are built on top of cash. These same systems can and will be built on top of Bitcoin. To adopt them, you may have to give up some of Bitcoin's inherent decentralization, but this would be a choice for the Bitcoin user and not something that you are forcefully shackled to like in our existing financial systems.  
Can't argue that current centralized institutional failures of companies haven't lead to losses for early adopters of Bitcoin, but it's definitely still early days. Once a legal framework grows around Bitcoin and law enforcement can justify pursuing bitcoin related crimes this may change. Ironically, the MtGox failure may be a catalyst in this regard.

@_date: 2014-02-21 05:54:14
To start with, I get the feeling you're not that familiar with Bitcoin yet (apologies if I'm mistaken). If you'd like, take a look at these:
Check [this video.](
Read [this article.](
Now, to respond to your inquiries:
1.) Since about the middle of November of last year, the value of bitcoin versus USD has actually been falling. Based on your implication, this would actually be incentive for someone holding bitcoin to buy at this point in time, right? More generally, though, I think you're referring to bitcoin's tremendous rise in value over its five year history. If you are solely looking upon Bitcoin as an investment, there might be little argument for what you say. However, if you study Bitcoin and see potential in it, it would be much more farsighted to attempt to promote and grow its use. Making purchases using Bitcoin is one simple and effective way to do this. To offset any concern about the changing value of Bitcoin in the future, simply replenish any bitcoin you spend now by immediately purchasing an equal amount of bitcoin from an exchange. Another factor is that bitcoin as a method of payment saves merchants money. Many of them are passing these savings on to consumers, and some are even offering very attractive discounts to grow their bitcoin customer base. There are even companies that act as middlemen to enable purchases via bitcoin and some of these even offer their own incentives. For instance, you can buy anything you like at Amazon using gift cards purchased from Gyft with bitcoin, and get 3% back from Gyft. This is all aside from the fact that Bitcoin is revolutionary in that other forms of electronic payment systems are all what's known as "pull" systems. Take a credit card purchase as an example. To buy with Visa you must trust a merchant by providing them with enough identifying information about yourself and your credit card account that they can pull payment from your account. This subjects your information and account to the risk of theft and loss, as in the recent large Target information breach. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is currently unique in being a "push" system of electronic payment. When you make a purchase you push the amount of payment to the vendor without sending any identifying information as well. It's as if you had a little science fiction transporter and you were able to zap your cash into the vendor's possession or account. In that way, it's like the Internet, but it's the Internet of money.
2.) The answer to this question largely depends on where you are. If you are in the U.S. the best option is probably [Coinbase]( but getting up and running could take several days. There are many other faster options. A couple of well known ones include [LocalBitcoins]( and [BitQuick.co]( Both of these are available in many countries outside of the U.S.  
This space is growing and changing rapidly, for example, there's a new service known as [BitVendr]( that claims to be able to deliver your Bitcoin purchase in seconds. I haven't used these guys yet, and they seems so new it's hard to find any posts regarding their service. they seem to be a middleman that uses a service called Venmo to buy from Coinbase without the verification process. When you can find no recommendations or warnings, Bitcoin can be the Wild West, so if you try these guys I'd definitely start with a small purchase.  
As far as safety is concerned, dealing with an established and transparent company like Coinbase would be a good idea. However, unless you've already established an account and done all of your verification, this would trade speed for safety. Arranging for an in-person exchange through LocalBitcoins could get you bitcoins in as little as a couple of hours, but you must take all of your own security precautions to avoid getting scammed. You would also likely pay a premium for the convenience in the exchange rate.  
If you're lucky enough to live near a Bitcoin ATM or vending machine, these would be a fast and safe option. There are not many now, but they spreading very quickly.
3.) As I mentioned before, if Identity Theft or keeping your private information secure is a concern, it is always better to use Bitcoin rather than conventional forms of payment. Also, large transfers of value, particularly across borders worldwide is trivial for Bitcoin, but you must always factor the costs of converting back to fiat at the destination if that is needed. The thing is, Bitcoin really is like cash, and can be viewed as the lowest layer of a financial system. With fiat, the existing financial infrastructure has been built around it. This has benefits such as fraud protection and FDIC insurance (for bank accounts in the U.S.). At the same time, it is some of the flaws of these systems that require these protections, and these protections come with costs. With Bitcoin, all of these same services and infrastructure can be added but largely do not exist yet. That, together with the fact that the legal status of Bitcoin is very much in its infancy means that Caveat Emptor is a mantra that a Bitcoin user cannot forget. You are ultimately responsible for the security of your own Bitcoin, and if you are defrauded through a con, at this point you would have not much if any recourse. The flip side of this is that vendors report basically zero fraud when accepting bitcoin for purchases, something that credit card sales cannot claim.
4.) I would say that the difference comes from how you consider an e-currency "established". Bitcoin is the first fully distributed, decentralized digital currency. As such, it currently has about an $8 Billion market capitalization, much higher than any of its competitors. This first-mover advantage has allowed it to develop significant network effect and should grant it some real "stickiness" when compared to potential competitors. Together with the fact that as an open-source protocol, Bitcoin can evolve and adopt future innovations in the digital currency space leaves it in a good position to be a strong contender as a currency, payment system, and store of value. In fact, there are many developments in the cryptocurrency space that are already building on top of Bitcoin, and that will rely on its existence and health for their own futures. While I don't think anyone can guarantee that Bitcoin will be the chief digital currency in 100 years, I find it hard to argue that it's not well positioned.
5.) If your bitcoins are lost or stolen you currently have very little recourse. This is largely because of the current undeveloped legal status of Bitcoin. At the same time, if you exercise care in your own security, you are not relying on any third party and their possible security flaws to protect your assets. Bitcoin largely allows you to be your own bank, but in this function you can only rely on yourself to protect your assets as well. If Bitcoin continues to grow and succeed, its legal status should be established relatively quickly. Developments in the U.S. are quite encouraging in this respect.
With regards to getting your bitcoins seized, with good security it is realistically impossible for any outside agency or third party to seize your coins.
6.) This is addressed by a couple of the revolutionary characteristics of Bitcoin as a digital currency: it is impossible to counterfeit, and it is basically inconceivable that it can be double-spent, or re-used as you put it. This is guaranteed by the enormous power of the distributed computing network that validates and verifies all bitcoin transactions. In order to execute a double-spend, an attacker would need to perform what's known as a 51% attack. Currently, it has been calculated that a successful attack would require resources which would total in the area of $1 to $1.5 Billion dollars to acquire. Those in any position to conduct a 51% attack would stand to lose far, far more in value then the attack could possibly bring them.

Actually, that statement is pretty much a historical fact (if you make it 18 months the statement covers the entire history of Bitcoin and would be *complete* fact). However, when I've seen it repeated, it's typically accompanied by the statement that past history does not guarantee future returns.  
Bitcoin is a very risky investment, which is partially reflected in its past incredible returns. I'm only aware of high-risk investments that even have the chance of offering returns in this range. But being high risk means it's also more likely than safer investments to drop by drastic amounts. The advice to not invest more than you can afford to lose is standard Bitcoin investment advice.

The correct analogy would be if, right after the Titanic hit the iceberg, most of the mass media decried the *entire shipping industry*.
MtGox is not Bitcoin. [This tweet put it well.](  
People use cash for vastly more shady things totalling much larger amounts everyday. The "Bitcoin is used for crime" argument is a complete red herring.
Please cite your reference for "the entire market is manipulated by puppet accounts". Without a doubt, the valuation of bitcoin is volatile, but anything that demonstrates volatility is not automatically a scam. In spite of its volatility, I would challenge you to find anyone who has steadily held bitcoin for nine months or more that has lost money. I'm not saying that past performance ensures future returns, just that there is a five year history where it does not yet meet any sort of "scam" definition.
Why do you think it matters that there are some people that have large holdings of bitcoin? The same is true of the U.S. dollar, does it deserve an equally tarnished reputation?  
Unfortunately, there is a universe of false information being presented about Bitcoin, and it appears you currently believe a good amount of it.
I won't contend that the failure of MtGox means that Bitcoin deserves a good reputation. I personally have a hard time seeing any currency as inherently "good" (to me, they're mostly a necessary evil), but I've yet to see a convincing argument as to why it *really deserves* a worse reputation than any other currency.

I don't think you can say you want anonymity and to guard your private information *and* purchase with debit/credit cards. Your debit/credit cards have your personal information already, and each time you use one, you are exposing your information during that purchase *and* for as long as the entity that you transacted with keeps your information.  
That all said, here are methods that will accept debit/credit cards for Bitcoin purchases -- I believe most if not all will need at least some identity verification before completing the sale:

Aside from permanent data storage (i.e., hard disk, ssd, or FLASH memory such as a USB thumb drive), the system requirements for bitcoind/Qt/Core are fairly low. There are reports of people building full nodes on Raspberry Pi's. Netbooks work fine as full nodes.  
Any system with enough RAM to run a modern operating system (at least ~1 GB), should be plenty.  
As far as permanent data storage, the system should have at least 30 GB free, and that will be filled up completely by blockchain growth in about a year. More storage is better. A 64 GB USB FLASH drive should be good for 2 or 3 years.

When you get to that level of resources to execute an attack, what system, country or government is safe from a nasty, well-executed surgical strike? Don't get me wrong, if there's a way to improve, I'm for it, but I think keeping in mind practical considerations, the imperative for developing improvements against 51% attacks right now is not that high.  
EDIT: 1% of transactions gone from the block chain would not mean the *coins* would disappear. I'd be surprised if the Bitcoin community would not work to get as many legitimate transactions restored as possible, in the unlikely event that such a disaster would occur.

Definitely the case, but two or more identical withdrawals within a short period could at least not be excluded as being due to TM. If there were a lot of them, and sometimes more than two transfers of the same amount, I might deduce that Gox's mishandling of TM might have been a significant cause of their losses. Since that evidence seems to be sorely lacking I'm currently leaning towards Gox's blaming TM is basically a red herring.

Well, I'll believe it happened that way once evidence starts showing up. If it never appears, we're looking at one big ass embezzlement.
On the DoS, I got a somewhat different feel for that. It didn't start until after MtGox stopped withdrawals. I bet some hacker got the devious idea planted in his head when reports of what was going on started coming out. So thanks, Karpeles, you gave hackers another idea for DoS.  
Not sure of the motive. Maybe he was trying to see if there were other vulnerabilities, maybe he was just trying to mess with Bitcoin in general. With Gox already not withdrawing, the likelihood that the DoS attack was going to be profitable in terms of stolen bitcoin was almost zero.
EDIT: Also, in the end the DoS apparently did all of Bitcoin a favor, because it forced all exchanges and major companies to check their implementations for proper TxID handling, and I believe core developers made some code contributions that have hardened the network against this kind of exploit in the future. It even revealed a small issue in the reference Bitcoin Qt client.

I think you might be wrong about that. Seeds are seeds, and they are used to generate HD private keys.  
When most people speak of a paper wallet, they are typically talking about a single public address/private key pair, for example as generated by bitaddress.org. If that was not what you meant when you said "paper wallet" before, I'm starting to understand how I got confused.  
EDIT: I should have said deterministic instead of "HD", and of course, any private key generated from a seed is still just a private key, not an "HD private key".

Bits are a unit of bitcoin. There are 1 million bits in a bitcoin. 100 bits is worth about 3 cents USD right now.  
If you have enough bits, you can use them to purchase directly from vendors who accept Bitcoin. Adoption has really increased recently. You can spend your bits directly at Dell, Overstock, Expedia, Newegg, Tigerdirect, among many, many others. You can donate to numerous charities like Sean's Outpost or the United Way. Wikipedia accepts Bitcoin donations as does Wikileaks. You can buy Reddit Gold with it, or you can use a gift card provider like Gyft to purchase from many other vendors.  
You can also exchange it for many other currencies, such as the US dollar or the Euro. How you do this depends on where you are. Here are some options:

OP asks about Bitcoin *technology* -- no restriction was made to keep things exactly as they stand now. If soft or hard forks can enable millions of transactions per block, or more, then clearly the technology *is* able to support mainstream adoption.  
But if any of the arguments that Bitcoin will scale in the future are "hand wavy", the claims that it cannot are clearly more so, since Bitcoin already functions comfortably at current levels, even using settings that are recognizably interim.

No, I think Coinbase is reputable, but they do hold your coins. If the company disappears, so do your funds (I don't think that is likely anytime soon).  
However, if you use Coinbase to buy our sell Bitcoin for USD, that account will have access to the banking and possibly credit card info. If the person you share the account with is not supposed to have that kind of access, the other wallet solutions may be better. You also might be able to just use the Coinbase wallet without adding the other info, but I've never tried that myself.

I'd be concerned. From just browsing this subreddit and other forums, I seem to run across trouble reports about Multibit more frequently than other wallets. Most are less serious issues like wrong balance, or transactions that don't send--these issues sound easy to correct.  
However, there's now one report of a change address issue losing funds that seems legit to me, and possibly a second case just reported recently. If you look at the comments from the first incident, one poster claims to have had exactly the same problem, and another claims he's seen other reports as well.  
My opinion would be that it's not worth the risk. If you like light wallets, Electrum is a good alternative. Armory is possibly even better, but it's a heavy install that includes a full reference wallet running within. For Armory to get synced initially will require at least 12 hours in most cases (and then only if you use the bootstrap.dat method).

Your original quote clearly makes the implication that such a development is quite a possibility. On the other hand, its actually clear there is no real motivation, need or interest in what you propose, since any application that doesn't involve a value token also has no interest in decentralization, making a block chain a bad solution due to inefficiency.

VCs in particular tend to place a lot of risky bets hoping some minority of their investments hit it big. Bitcoin is absolutely a risky investment. And though I didn't mention price or bubbles, over its short 4-5 year history, Bitcoin is intimately familiar with bubbles.  
Regardless, when you see a lot of VC firms throwing cash at something, there's likely some possibility there. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't know of any that threw money at QR code startups.  
For the sake of discussion, I suppose a time scale would be helpful. The cryptocurrency space is changing very quickly. I'd be very surprised if Bitcoin fades into obscurity within three years. Will it be highly relevant in 10 years? I wouldn't want to guess.

This is a standard view espoused by many that may even rise to being outright brainwashing from the existing financial kleptocracy. With fractional reserve banking, banks are making money by risking your funds at basically no risk to themselves. For this, they make massive profits. In return, they should pay interest to those that park their funds. How's your interest these days? Is your bank still making money? Any interest you are not seeing that is still profit to the bank is funds taken from you, no matter how you want to justify it to yourself. Add often massive and inefficient infrastructure across hundreds of millions of depositors and you really have something to ponder.  


The friction the fee adds to financial transactions exists and is paid for by all consumers. That many merchants are not yet offering consistent discounts for accepting Bitcoin in no way excuses this. At least Bitcoin offers an avenue for improvement. It's up to consumers to start using Bitcoin and voting with their funds by using merchants that pass savings along.

Good advice. I do think it is somewhat suspicious, but purse.io and brawker.com have been around for a little while now. If the scamming was going on as much as people claim, I think there'd more legitimate smoke by now (posts of users with first-hand scam knowledge, criminal cases, lawsuits, etc.).  
I think it's also *possible* that people are willing to pay a premium due to the dearth of credit/debit card purchase options. Some LocalBitcoins sellers already have high premiums, and they often don't even accept credit/debit. In any case, if Circle comes out of beta, I'd expect the business for both purse and brawker to basically disappear.

Whether these things will be handled better by a system like Ripple is to me an open question. For now, it seems that there are still too few gateways in the Ripple system and their fees are too high to draw this conclusion right now.  
In addition, Ripple is a trust handling system, which is just another way of saying you must put varying amounts of faith in different centralized parties. In fact, the XRP itself is nearly entirely centralized. Does Bitcoin have some disadvantages when compared to other systems? Possibly, but against Ripple, I have yet to be convinced that it stacks up worse.

As already mentioned, importing your private key does not broadcast any transaction. The wallet can scan the blockchain for the paired public address and display the balance.  
However, once the private key has been imported to a hot wallet, the cold private key will no longer be completely "cold" anymore since a hot wallet is always live.
If you'd like to restore the funds to a truly "cold" paper wallet, they should be sent from the imported private key to an unexposed cold paper wallet.

I've noticed that most of hacks resulting in lost funds that actually make it to the news are from a couple years ago or more. If memory serves, it was even more common before that.

Bitcoin is open source, so anyone, even you can be a developer. So anyone can change the code in any way they like, but as said, it only gets incorporated into the network as a consensus of miners and clients. This makes increasing the $21 million bitcoin limit a virtual impossibility.
If, for whatever reason, it becomes felt that there are not enough base units in Bitcoin (currently the satoshi, or 100 millionth of a bitcoin), this can also be changed, but this kind of change would be much more likely to be adopted if seen as necessary in the future.

Not sure if these issues are the same in Germany as they are in the U.S., but Bitcoin dramatically reduces settlement times to the order of minutes or hours as opposed to the days/weeks/months the banking and credit card systems can take.

As a roughly six year old entity, Bitcoin is young and extremely volatile, but has also exhibited tremendous growth. Its volatility is already observably declining, so if Bitcoin continues to exist and grow as it has I believe any future remaining volatility will be dramatically less. There are also existing ways to be isolated from volatility, with more being developed, and merchants are already able to accept it with complete immunity from its volatility. Regardless, I see no reason that even the most extreme volatility would prevent credit card-type services from being offered. Fees, interest and benefits could simply be adjusted or pegged to less volatile valuations by agreement between the company and its customers. The benefits that Bitcoin offers to fiat are probably too numerous to go into here, but I'll mention immunity from arbitrary central bank currency printing, borderlessness, a perfectly known and set monetary policy, being nearly instantly transmittable for unlimited amounts at nearly no cost to anywhere digital communication is possible, being immune from counterfeiting, offering full flexibility in transactions from nearly perfect anonymity to complete transparency, and operating with no possibility of leaking private information. Bitcoin is moving towards establishing its own economic ecosystem where conversion back to fiat would no longer be required. In such a case, its benefits would be maximized and using a Bitcoin credit card, should you choose to do so, would not require any extra steps at all.  


In your case, the benefits might be smaller but still exist. There is also the loss, fraud, and poor privacy security of credit cards, all of which manifests as higher prices at credit card-accepting merchants to be considered. Bitcoin is about choices and capability. No one is forcing you to use Bitcoin, but right now most people that want to use an electronic payment system are stuck with the costs (plain and hidden) imposed by credit cards. It's still very much early days for Bitcoin, but it's inherent programmability is already fueling cheaper and better alternatives for fraud protection. Perks and rewards can easily be added as a service by any company that wants to try to collect fees and/or offer debt-based services which charge interest. As one of the world's lucky few that lives in a first-world nation, Bitcoin's current benefits are not quite as stark to you as they might be if you lived in an area without such highly developed financial infrastructure and regulation. But if greater adoption happens in those lesser developed areas first, it'll just serve as more incentive for increased use even in the most industrialized nations.  


Then you are clearly not the typical credit card customer, because if all the benefits were paid out fully to all of their customers at the levels you describe, and if all fees and interest payments were so easily avoided, the company would be a charity rapidly driving itself into bankruptcy instead of being a profitable business.  


There's no question that Bitcoin's benefits are more immediately apparent to merchants, and that merchants should help themselves save even more by incentivizing their customers to increase bitcoin use, but this has not happened yet in a consistent way. That is not to say that savings cannot be had for customers using Bitcoin right now, but often discounts are time and amount limited (such as a recent 25% savings offer from Newegg), or must be realized using gift cards or another indirect service (like via Gyft, eGifter, Cardflip, or Brawker). Still, when evaluating Bitcoin, its the totality of currently benefits as well as the potential it offers that should be considered. The currency/payment network aspect of Bitcoin is just the first application of block chain technology. Numerous others exist or are actively being developed. Considering the tremendous amounts of venture capital pouring into the space, dramatic innovations could well be just around the corner.  


Realistically, Bitcoin must still be regarded as experimental and relatively high risk (though its riskiness has clearly declined during its short life). I agree that right now, it's not for everyone, but I think it's an overstatement to say that it holds no appeal for a "normal customer". It's very innovative and its features are worth an objective look. Each person will have to make their own decision about it, and in the end, Bitcoin's success or failure will be clear in the marketplace.

Blockchain.info never has control of your private keys, they only store encrypted copies. This means they do not have the capability to abscond with your funds.  
Even if Blockchain were to completely implode, as long as you have a backup of your wallet, you will still have access to your funds.  
However, by the same token, if you lose your password to your wallet, Blockchain cannot help you reset or change it. Your funds could be lost forever in this case.

For the record, fraud is "... a deception deliberately practiced in order to secure unfair or unlawful gain" (from Wikipedia). When Bitcoins are lost, it's always theft, there is never any ongoing deception because it's simply not possible.  
Any electronic application of a financial instrument is vulnerable to the the same theft of credentials from an endpoint as Bitcoin. The difference is, when the credentials of a credit card, for instance, are stolen, they are then used to commit fraud in a possibly ongoing way. The bitcoins are simply stolen once and it's done.  
However, for credit cards, those same credentials can also be stolen from the merchants they've been previously used at, by bad-actor workers accepting the cards, via skimmers, etc., etc. Bitcoin signed transactions and public addresses cannot be used for fraud in this way. The only ways Bitcoins are lost is via theft of private keys. So the surface area of attack is much smaller, making Bitcoin more secure.  
I don't think Overstock and Tiger Direct would agree with your assessment. Their last quarterlies definitely did not bear out your contentions. However, I'll withold judgement until we see next quarter's results.  
In any case, the savings are the same in percentage terms regardless of volume. You could very well be right that the existing sales numbers for Bitcoin are miniscule compared to other payment forms. Therefore, merchants understanding this realize that by driving more of their business to use Bitcoin rather than other forms of payment they are saving more. That's why you are seeing more and more merchants offering discounts for Bitcoin use only. The higher the percentage of sales in Bitcoin means merchants save more, so it makes sense for them to try to draw customers into using it as well.  
The alternative is you don't give special discounts, but you still save on fees compared to your competitors that are not using Bitcoin. These merchants can lower their prices overall, attracting more customers, some percentage of which can and will use Bitcoin.

While I think this is excellent, sensible advice, the fact is there are no index funds that match the average annual return that Bitcoin has historically shown.  
As long as the buyer/investor realizes that buying Bitcoins is *enormously* risky, some sensible amount of any portfolio can be devoted to high-risk, potentially high-return investments.

I would, for reasons I'll expand upon. However, if your trip will be a long one, you may not want to keep your entire bitcoin budget in Mycelium, since it's private key is held locally. Carry amounts similar to what you would be comfortable carrying in a fiat wallet. When necessary, you could top up your Mycelium wallet from a safe web wallet protected by 2FA.  
Since their March database crash, Blockchain.info's services have been pretty spotty -- including their My Wallet service. Until they get their act together, you could get stranded without access to your coins.
I've seen many reports of long delays associated with sends from Coinbase's wallet service. For Internet or brick-and-mortar purchases, these delays can often prevent successful transactions.  
In contrast, Mycelium creates, signs and sends transactions locally. My understanding is that this process does not require support from any cloud service (however, showing a correct balance does require a live server connection). I can't remember seeing a report of trouble trying to complete a transaction with Mycelium.

No, I think if you look at his second set of transactions, this means the transaction of the double-spend that you do not want miners to accept includes a send to the "correct horse battery staple" address *in addition* to the send to the merchant you are trying to defraud. It also used a relatively low fee, though I don't know which factor was more important in this case.

Right, but the document shows only "Public key" but neglects hash. Since a public key is also something that exists, but is not generally used for BTC transactions, that might lead to some confusion. Unless it's there for some reason I'm unaware of.

First, don't worry, the funds will either be sent successfully, or they will stay in your wallet, there's no other possibility.

Aside from what has already been mentioned, Bitcoin really shines in transmitting value internationally. It's borderless, and you can send any amount for a tiny, optional fee. For international travel, it has the potential to minimize or eliminate the need for currency exchange.  
It also processes transaction at all hours, without dependence on the operating hours of a bank or other centralized party.

@_date: 2014-02-27 02:17:37
I don't think that's the case. What Gox is claiming is that they had an automated system in place to check if a withdrawal completed by looking for the original Tx ID in the blockchain. However, if the original withdrawal transaction traveled through a network path where a node mutated the Tx ID (I've heard this may have been innocently done to update MtGox's outdated Tx ID representations to make them conform to newer standards), the Gox system would never find that the orginal transaction even though it was successfully transferred and confirmed.  Gox's system would then *automatically* re-send the withdrawal to the same destination address as before.  
In this case, there should be multiple confirmed transactions in the blockchain that show duplicates in terms of total transferred, (likely) sending address, and receiving address.

How is the currency used irrelevant when all existing fiat currencies must be tied to counter party payment systems to be used at any online marketplace? Once such counter parties are involved, you are at the mercy of their policies and charges. OpenBazaar using Bitcoin offers transparency and freedom from such unilateral control.  
You are correct that eBay has the current lion's share of the market. It will take a better alternative to change that. Let's see what the future brings.  
You mention that Darknet markets already exist, but you fail to go on to say existing payment networks like credit cards and Paypal *cannot* be used there. That's just one more way that Bitcoin shines. Also, when you use current Darknet markets, you're still dealing with centralized entities that are essentially like eBay. OpenBazaar has the potential to free you from any counter party related issues.

First thing, it's next to impossible to make money mining on a small scale right now. To even try, you'd need free/super cheap electricity, about $1,000 USD to invest, and a place that can provide 24/7 cooling and tolerate fan noise. Anything less and you are guaranteed to lose money.  
That said, if you still want to mine as a hobby or for whatever other reason acknowledging that you will be paying for the privilege, know that to mine Bitcoin directly you will need software/hardware that mines the SHA256 hashing algorithm. The Block Erupter you linked to at Amazon is old and obsolete, and is available used at eBay for $5 or $6 USD, but it does mine SHA256.  
CleverMining, on the other hand, is a mining pool for software/hardware mining the Scrypt hashing alogrithm. You can still do this (again likely not profitably) using high-powered GPUs and the right software, or the cheapest ASIC hardware for Scrypt mining that I'm aware of is the [Gridseed]( In this case, you're really not directly mining Bitcoin, but you're mining a Scrypt-based altcoin like Litecoin or Dogecoin. Cleverming picks the most profitable one and automatically converts your mining profits to Bitcoin before paying you.

First, understand that mining has changed and is big business now. No matter how you mine, there's no guarantee for small miners to make a profit anymore. Still, some people mine as a hobby, but hobbies tend to *cost* money, don't they?  
That said, it *may* cost you less money to mine a Scrypt-based altcoin than to mine Bitcoin directly. There are a number of pools, like [CleverMining]( which claim to continuously switch to mining whichever Scrypt-based coin is most profitable at the time.  
Keep in mind, Scrypt is not SHA256, so that ASICminer you mentioned cannot be used for Scrypt as it is SHA256 only (that's Bitcoin's hashing algorithm). High-end GPU's and the newer Scrypt ASICs like Gridseed are what you'd want for Scrypt mining.

It's pretty much a free market. It's worth what someone will give you for it. This is exactly the same as how fiat currencies float on the foreign exchange market, but Bitcoin is still in its infancy and existing markets for it are not very liquid, therefore it's subject to much higher volatility.

If there is a backdoor in Bitcoin Core/Qt, then there would be risk. The good news is the code is open source, and lots of people have looked. The asterisk here is the same was true with OpenSSL and HeartBleed still happened.  
Apart from that, it's conceivable that a backdoor in your modem and/or router (if you use one) could add additional vulnerability, but I think that's even less likely than the backdoor in the Bitcoin Core code.  
TL;DR: The chances are small IMHO.

This is an old scam. Whoever is transferring the wallet has a backup of the private keys and will sweep them the moment they receive whatever it is they want from you. Don't fall for it.

If you don't want to wait at all, use a lite wallet like Electrum. If you want to continue to get the full blockchain, make sure you port forward through your router (I think it's port 8333, but double check this). That'll give you more connections and a faster download assuming your internet connection has enough bandwidth.
If you were starting from scratch you could use BitTorrent and download most of the blockchain from gzarik manually, but I think you've already got most of the chain now so just speeding things up if possible is probably the best strategy.

When you use blockchain.info to create a wallet, the private keys are stored on your local computer. If your computer becomes infected with keylogger malware, your funds can be stolen.

To be fair, Bitcoin, like any other fast growing asset or commodity, does grow faster the more people choose to get involved in it. The difference is, there's no central entity controlling funds and skimming users' money, and there can't be a collapse due to disappearing reserves.

You really only need your private key, as you can always derive the public address and public key from that. If you're going to regularly send funds to a private/public pair, it's best to keep a copy of the public address on hand. There's no loss risk in anyone knowing your public address, but the balance and transaction history for that address can be viewed by anyone who knows it.
Keep in mind that most wallets are a collection of private key/public address pairs. So to backup your entire balance, you would need all the private keys controlling non-zero amounts. As mentioned, for deterministic wallets, just backing up the seed is enough.

If you need to withdraw USD, I personally don't know of any confirmed withdrawal from Mt.Gox in the last several months. Many are skeptical that those withdrawals will ever resume.
In terms of the possibility for profiteering or arbitraging, I'm fairly sure it happens but have not tried it myself. In the best situations, there will be normal withdrawal delays and fees to deal with. This can quickly complicate trying to time bitcoin's high volatility.
Since you are quoting valuation in USD, I'd guess you're in the U.S. [Coinbase]( is generally recognized as a good option to reliably obtain bitcoin in the states right now, though it's not actually an exchange. There are no established bitcoin exchanges in the U.S. that have good market depth and liquidity (another new exchange in the U.S. that you didn't mention is [Kraken]( The most popular exchanges outside of China that have good volume are [Bitstamp]( (Slovenia) and [BTC-e]( (actual location not known, but suspected to be located in Bulgaria or Russia). Withdrawing USD from Bitstamp or BTC-e will generally involve bank wires and the associated fees, as well as likely reporting to the IRS for any large transfer received.
I'd expect any successful arbitrager would be using programmed trading via one or more exchanges' APIs. I think this would require developing your own coded interface or purchasing a commercial one.
In short, I think arbitraging can be done, but it's much more complicated than it seems at first glance.

I concur that a [Trezor]( might be a good idea for you.  
But in your current configuration, you entered the seeds you created into your Macbook when it was online? If so, then those seeds are not truly cold, since an unknown vulnerability could have sent your seeds over the network. I don't think this is very likely to have happened, though, because if it did your 920 BTC would likely have vanished long ago.  
Truly cold seeds or private keys never come in contact with online devices. The proper course would've been to create the seeds and enter them into an offline, signing-only instance of Electrum. That offline computer could then create the associated Master Public Keys, which you could then burn to a CD-R or copy off in some other safe method. Those Master Public Keys could then be entered into an online instance of Electrum to show the balance of the wallets. Any transaction signing would need to be done from an offline, cold instance of Electrum and transferred by some method over the "air gap" to broadcast on a hot, Internet-connected computer.  
My other concern is that paper can be subject to fading, degradation, mutilation, etc. I'd seek a more robust way of storing the secrets, such as metal etching or the like.

The whole purpose of ID establishment or verification is a centralized function, so as far as I can imagine now, there will always be some centralization at the edges. I think there are still advantages in potentially using a block chain at the core. Among these are that it solves counterfeiting issues, and removes the need for any central agency to maintain and administrate the identification database. In addition, if enough advantage is found to use the block chain, then the information admistered by the block chain is that much more easily accessed by DACs and DAOs.  
It seems that there are already many cryptographic techniques that can be used to give varying levels of affirmation of DNA backing while still keeping the DNA sequence itself entirely private. Many of these are already used in Bitcoin. Regarding your fake DNA suggestions, although there could be some possible issues there (particularly if checking the purported DNA presented against your own DNA is impractical for whatever use-case is being considered), but in the end your own biological material would be the ultimate verification.  
No question there are unsolved questions in implementation, and many may turn out to be too thorny to be practical. At first glance, my feeling is this won't be the case with most issues. I believe that the innovation that will develop to implement these concepts is only beginning to be seen today.

Nice question from your girlfriend, and it seems to have been quite thoroughly answered here.  
It seems your girlfriend was asking about this out of concern about the security of Bitcoin funds, so you may also want to mention (as already raised by that even though Blockchain.info states they do not control or have access to your private keys, there are potential vulnerabilities in the chain that delivers their javascript code to your browser. In the end, complete security is up to the end user.  
Each time you access your BC.i wallet over the Internet, you could be getting a new copy of the javascript code. If BC.i is hacked, has a malicious employee, or goes evil itself, this code could be changed to steal your private keys any time you try to use them. Of course, you can always review the javascript code for yourself, but this is like studying the multiple pages of dense legalese in a terms and conditions form before accepting online bill pay: not many do it.  
One of the great things about Bitcoin is the freedom of choice it enables. In the extreme, this choice *can* allow anyone to be completely secure on their own, requiring that no trust is vetted in any other party. But this is something that currently requires a tremendous amount of work. Hopefully this will improve as Bitcoin matures, but short of downloading the source code for Bitcoin Core or Armory and compiling it for yourself (of course after you've studied the machine language of the compiler itself for malicious code, and inspecting your hardware piecemeal for embedded malicious firmware), you *always have the choice of who you choose to trust.*  
In BC.i's case, normal use of their wallet means you trust (or have examined at least once) their javascript code and are further trusting them to keep their infrastructure secure. From that point, as long as you check the URL you use to access them, and when you do access them that they have a valid security certificate authenticated by a CA (which you also must trust), you can have a reasonable level of certainty about the security of your funds when accessed from a secure device.  
Where this differs from existing currencies and payment systems is that Bitcoin always offers the option of trusting no one at all given you're willing to put in the elbow grease. All prior existing systems require you to trust one or many other entities simply by adopting their use.

If you created the paper wallet using a computer that was connected to the Internet at the time, there is always the possibility (possibly remote if the computer is well maintained and secure) that the private key may be compromised. It's best to do cold storage paper wallet creation from fully disconnected devices, and to purge/securely delete any cache or residual files associated with the creation of the paper wallet before restoring the computer to the Internet after the fact.
An offline computer cleanly booted from a Linux Live CD is a good choice for this purpose.

Generates a weak key from a previously non-weak private key? What is the mechanism here, I'm not familiar with it?  
My understanding is that if you *spend* from an address the public key is revealed, presenting a surface area of attack to the network that was not previously available (basically, you've made it one step easier to theoretically figuring out the private key than it would've been if an attacker only had the address). In addition, each spend from the same address signs a new segment of transaction data, providing more fodder that an attacker could theoretically collect and include in calculations attempting to derive the private key — more such collected information could only make the attack easier.  
However, I'm not aware of a method to make a private key more vulnerable to attack by only receiving funds there — even if funds are sent to its associated address multiple times. Do you know of one? I suppose simply seeing an address used more often in the block chain makes it more likely that an attacker may become aware of it and decide to try to attack it, but that's the only way I can think of that making multiple sends to an address increases its susceptibility to attack. I thought the main objections to doing this revolve around the risk of revealing information about your funds and your transactions via block chain investigation.  
In any case, from what I know, the methods to conduct an attack seeking a private key from a particular address or public key are extremely resource intensive and difficult, so even increasing the ease of these attacks marginally by reusing an address does not make an attack especially practical. This is probably even more true considering the lack of incentive that balances of mere mortals would represent in such addresses relative to the cost to realistically mount an attack.  
The caveat, of course, is if a new mathematical method is discovered that represents a shortcut compared to existing attack methods, all private keys could suddenly be at greater risk. However, if this happens, Bitcoin is far from the only technology employing cryptography that will have problems.

Informative thread, nice find. Perhaps the "three days" or "a few days" is about how long it typically takes for an unconfirmed transaction to start disappearing from a significant number of memory pools (presuming the original transaction is not being re-broadcasted somehow, typically by the sending wallet). I've seen that time frame mentioned several times in threads about under-fee transactions taking too long and asking what can be done about it. Presumably, by that time enough memory pools will have dropped the original transaction that a second transaction using the same inputs (but including a proper fee) can be sent. The second transaction would get mined into a block quickly, at which point the first transaction apparently gets removed from any memory pools that still have it.  
This begs the question, does a long-running node get its memory pool cluttered up by unconfirmed transactions? If so, that could have an affect on program stability in a resource limited system. Maybe a time to live of, say, 96 hours for unconfirmed transactions would guard against this. I'd guess mining pools and others that depend on long running nodes implement something like that on their own if it's not already in the reference code.

Reading over the information on LocalBitcoins' for escrow, it seems that you would normally send the bitcoins for the exchange to a LB escrow address, right? For that, you should have been able to use your own devices completely (no need to scan a QR generated by her). Once funds arrive there, she should be able to see it on her end in her LB page. That's normally when she should have paid you, then you'd release escrow, and the funds would appear in her LB wallet. Transaction done.  
There still could have subsequently been a problem if her computer was compromised when she tried to send from her LB wallet to an external one, but I think that would be between LB and her, and would ultimately be her responsibility for having a compromised computer.  
Correct me if I'm wrong about any of this. I've never used LB. I'm just going off the text of their escrow description.

12) Supports m-of-n signature transactions that allow things like free escrow where a third party can release funds but no party is required to hold the funds in question.
13) Frictionless transactions even for very large amounts, the current record [was a single transaction worth about $147 million USD at the time]( and it was sent with no fee.
14) Offers ability to do free, verifiable notarizing and timestamping via the block chain.
15) Open-source nature permits Bitcoin to evolve by adopting future innovations subject to a consensus of network peers (miners and full nodes).
16) In a hostile, untrusted environment, the distributed and decentralized network of Bitcoin has demonstrated sturdy, anti-fragile characteristics over a 5 year history.
17) Can transfer value globally, irrespective of national borders or foreign currencies--may revolutionize the international remittances market.
And the above are just things that are inherent to Bitcoin now. Of course, other layers can be built on top of Bitcoin, such as all our familiar (but centralized) banking, finance and insurance services such as fractional reserve banking and insured deposits. No one would be required to accept such centralized services, but they could easily be offered using Bitcoin.
More importantly, decentralized and distributed systems are being developed on top of Bitcoin (e.g. colored coins, Open Transactions, Mastercoin, etc.), or have been inspired by Bitcoin elsewhere in the cryptocurrency or other distributed service spaces (e.g. Ethereum, Protoshares, Bitmessage, etc.) These promise to enable truly revolutionary decentralized and distributed services (e.g. distributed currency exchange, verifiable voting, wills and estates, property deeds, and innumerable other DAC applications).

Of the two spend attempts in a double-spend attack, miners would have no way of knowing which one is real and which one is fake (presuming they are both properly signed and structured). They simply choose the transactions they want to try to add to a block and then solve for a suitable nonce.  
Once a nonce is found by any miner with either transaction from the double-spend attack in the block, that one is the "official" transaction unless the block is orphaned. This is why it becomes exponentially more unlikely for a transaction to be a double-spend with each subsequent block confirmation.  
So if I tried to double-spend by sending 100 bitcoins as a payment, and simultaneously tried sending the same 100 bitcoins back to myself, only one of the transactions will go through. If the vendor waits for x number of confirmations, he will know with exponentially increasing certainty whether he got the 100 bitcoins or they went somewhere else.

Another way to look at this is that all Bitcoin addresses already exist. What's happening when a wallet gives you a public address is the software is just generating a private key/public address pair. Once the offline system has created this pair, the public address just defines the ledger "cell" that only the paired private key permits access to. Any online wallet can send to this ledger "cell" even if the paired private key has never been exposed to the Internet at all.

Each address is paired to a private key that controls funds sent to that address. Wallets are collections of these address/private key pairs. It's best practice not to re-use addresses, so some wallets may generate new addresses for you, although the wallet should explain that process and let you control it. Wallets should also be able to display a history of addresses that have been created and used.

Best practice dictates that you really should to boot to an independent OS, though it does not have to be Linux. The reason is you must assume that you don't have perfect knowledge, and that there may be malware, a bug, or some sort of loophole that could leave a copy of a private key somewhere on your live system. Even if you disconnect your regular system from the Internet while creating your paper wallets, the next time you connect, an existing or future infection or backdoor could lead to such a remnant getting stolen.  
To preclude this possibility, booting from a Live CD of Linux, Windows PE, a Live CD version of OSX (if such a thing exists), or any other suitable OS would prevent any permanent data getting written to storage that could later be accessible when your system goes back online.  
That's absolute best practice, though. Since you're using OSX, there are already fewer possible attack vectors than with Windows. You could just use your regular OS disconnected from the Internet. Just realize that you would be some amount *less* secure than if you booted from some kind of Live CD or the equivalent.

First, keep this in mind:  
If you are still interested in investing, consider taking your capital and just purchasing bitcoins. The valuation right now may represent a good entry point, and many miners realize in hindsight that they would've made more from their investment if they had taken this approach.  
That said, if you are still interested in mining, one possibly profitable route is to mine the most profitable altcoin and just get paid in bitcoin. Pools such as CleverMining.com and Middlecoin.com do this using the Scrypt algorithm. Scrypt ASICs are just starting to come to market, and sellers claim to have a few types in stock (e.g. Google Gridseed). Also, the newest AMD GPUs can still mine Scrypt fairly competitively, but are not quite as power efficient as the newest ASICs.  
At the level of investment you mentioned, I think the Scrypt method is more likely to turn a profit than trying to get ahold of the latest SHA256 ASICs and directly mining for bitcoin.

To check if your port is properly open, go here:  
and click the "Probe THIS Port" button. Under "Status", you should see "OPEN!" with a pink background.  
The above only applies if you manually forwarded port 8333, not if you're using UPnP.
In addition, your peer should eventually get more than 8 connections. If port 8333 is closed and UPnP is disabled or not working properly, 8 will be the maximum number of connections. You can check the number of connections in Bitcoin Core by hovering your mouse over the little bar graph in the lower right corner of the GUI window, or go to Help &gt; Debug window &gt; "Information" tab.  
I'm not sure how to check connections in Bitcoin Armory, but it should be similar.

2) Create a signed transaction and give this transaction in raw form to the recipient via any convenient method (e.g. burn a CD/DVD, use a USB FLASH drive, create and print out a QR code, etc.) Either or both the payer and and the payee can push the transaction to the Bitcoin network when they get to a live Internet connection.

If by "them" you mean BTC he bought on his own exchange for super cheap ($90-$325), he can't sell them anywhere because they basically wouldn't exist based on the assumption that he has a loss that needs to be "made up".  


I'm not talking about things as they were before the whole tranaction malleability/blocked withdrawals situation started at MtGox. Of course when Gox was trading $100-$150 higher than other exchanges, Karpeles could have been buying BTC outside and them selling them on his own exchange to make a fiat profit. But that would have been before he would have needed to "make up" anything.  
Basically, it seems like I'm not making my explanation understood. We're talking about the situation since Gox stopped allowing BTC withdrawals, right? That's when the Gox price for BTC dropped rapidly. So say before there was any re-sending of withdrawals due to Gox's mishandling of transaction malleability, Gox's books showed they had 100,000 BTC, and at that point we'll assume they actually did have the full 100,000 real BTC. At some point, someone figures out that requesting withdrawals from Gox often causes automatic re-sends, so they keep doing it. Now the real amount of BTC at Gox starts to drop quickly while the books don't record the lost, re-sent coins because the system still thinks all the re-sends amount to only single successful transactions. Karpeles finally figures this out and stops withdrawals, but by this time his books still might say he should have 100,000 BTC, but in the case of a severe loss, Gox might really have only, say 5,000 or less left.  
Let's just take 5,000 then for simplicity's sake. He could now take all 5,000 of the remaining real BTC and sell them on an outside exchange once. He would have 5,000x$650=$3.25 million. Now with all the various FUD in the news, most of which is coming from Gox itself, the BTC price at outside exchanges is bouncing around. At best, let's say he then buys back BTC when it falls to its lowest at Bitstamp around $325 (this is being as generous as possible, as it basically never fell this low on outside exchanges except for very brief periods). He'd now have 10,000 BTC if he arbed perfectly. But you see, to make it all back, he needs 100,000 BTC. It's just not enough of an arb advantage even in the best case. He can't just continue to buy internally at $90 and sell outside at $650, because there are no real BTC in Gox. Those are just internal book figments. If he wants any more BTC, he has to get them where everyone else gets them, on outside exchanges at outside prices, giving him basically no arbitrage advantage except for what he can get by manipulating press releases, info leaks, and the media. You could add his personal stash of BTC, and it could improve his arbing ability some by having more on hand to arb with, but it still would not even close to the arb advantage he would have if he could buy real BTC at the low prices that have appeared on his own exchange. Because in our scenario those GoxBTC are just not really there to be bought. They're just mistaken numbers on Gox's ledgers, there's no real BTC to be had.
That's why I contend there's really no arbitrage available based on the internal Gox prices, since in this ugly scenario, there'd be almost no real BTC left to back the supposed amount of GoxBTC. In other words, in a situation where there were substantial losses, all the buying and selling of GoxBTC is just trading in IOUs for real BTC. The actual BTC themselves have already been mistakenly paid out due to the Gox's mishandling of transaction malleability. Karpeles could buy all the cheap BTC IOUs he wants from his own exchange, but he would not be able to sell them outside, because they aren't real BTC.

1) How do you think the insurance for fraud gets paid for? Much less the cost of dealing with the administration for fraud, the legal repercussions of fraud, or the criminal pursuit of fraud? Imagine how much is saved by just eliminating the fraud entirely. Exchanges and computers being hacked are both examples of poor digital security. If Bitcoin was as old as fiat, I guarantee similar services would be available for Bitcoin as they are now available for credit services for cash. Just as they currently do for Visa, fees would then apply. *That* is the real advantage of Bitcoin--when properly used, it has the ability to remove middlemen and reduce friction in many parts of the financial sector. The reduction of associated costs would eventually benefit every part of the economy.  
2) Yes, at this time they would have to choose to weather volatility. And over the past four years they would have had to deal with the ~1,000,000% appreciation in Bitcoin valuation that has resulted as well. As Bitcoin reaches a steady state with all capital already in Bitcoin that wants to enter, volatility should reduce, and the deflationary aspect should be low and steady. This may not happen for some time, but I believe it will happen.  
At this point, regarding 2), I simply mean that Bitcoin can function as a borderless exchange of value, if both consumer and vendor agree. When used as such, no exchange spreads necessarily apply. This cannot be said for fiat for the simple reason that different nations often use different currencies.

Are you running an old version of Bitcoin-Qt? Since the value of bitcoin has grown so quickly, old versions had fee structures that used to be quite minimal but are now ridiculously high. To avoid this, update your Qt installation to the latest Qt/Core 0.9.1. Backup your wallet.dat file before doing the upgrade.
Even running 0.9.1, if you are trying to transfer your entire balance to Electrum in a single transaction, you will likely be required to pay some fees (much less than 0.045 BTC, though). This is because that transaction will likely be composed of a lot of inputs which result in a large transaction size. It's also likely some of your inputs will not have high priority/coin age.  
If you want to completely minimize the fees involved in emptying your Qt/Core wallet, take advantage of the new Coin Control feature. You'll need to enable this feature in Settings &gt;&gt; Options &gt;&gt; Display. Create separate transactions that have high priority/high coin age inputs, and that result in a small transaction size. These can often be sent without any fee at all. For any small inputs or low priority inputs, you'll have to see what the best way is to bundle them with low fess. You can also wait until the priority of the inputs increases before sending, as this will reduce fees as well.

Fiat currencies crash all the time in places like Zimbabwe. It may be happening right now in Argentina. These crashes aren't likely to have a large impact on Bitcoin since Bitcoin adoption in those places is but a small fraction of the network's overall use.
Now, if the U.S. dollar collapsed, I think that's a much more dire situation. In that case, I'm betting that utility power and Internet networks would be struggling or not available also. No Internet, no cryptocurrencies of any kind for the most part.
However, in the recovery from such a cataclysmic state, I'd bet a crypto like Bitcoin would get much more consideration as a replacement for the old fiat system as opposed to a gold-backed currency, for instance, or just another floating fiat. Considered on even footing in this kind of societal reboot, the advantages of Bitcoin become glaring.

I don't think so. A paper "bill" version of a Bitcoin paper wallet would basically need to be disposable once completely emptied. The act of using any funds on it the first time removes the "cold" nature, and that can never be restored to the private key on refilling it. Basically, once a private key has "seen" the Internet, it has lost its most secure aspect.

If Teamviewer *was* set to allow outside connections, I'd suspect the attacker got in that way, used a zero-day key logger of some kind to capture your wallet pass phrase, and then either sent the funds from your wallet directly, or uploaded your wallet.dat and swept your funds at the attacker's convenience. Did you look for the outbound transaction in your Bitcoin-qt's logs?

There's also the concern/possible increased risk that since they are among the most opaque of the larger exchanges, they could go poof with customers' funds more easily.  
That said, they have a fairly long service record and have been generally trustworthy (relatively speaking in Bitcoin time frames; there are some horror stories about their customer service), and they allow you to trade with basically no AML/KYC.

As in [this thread]( whatever the amount was that was lost due to negligence in the transaction malleability fiasco, you should be able to find repeated pay outs in the blockchain.

I'd agree that an average person would expect more security easily available than there currently is with Bitcoin. It's early days, and it's not for everyone. But I don't think the problems are nearly as dire as you paint them.
If I assume your statement that a similarly infected computer will have Bitcoins stolen more often than it will encounter credit card or PayPal theft, which I am not at all sure is the case, I would contend the only reason for this would be Bitcoin's currently uncertain legal status. Criminals know stealing fiat and violating the security of major corporations is really going to sic the dogs on them, legally speaking. With Bitcoin's legal status not yet fully established, the same is not yet true with the theft of Bitcoins. However, those protections related to fiat are not free, either in the corporate or legal realms, and we've all had to pay for them in one way or another over the years. If you go into Bitcoin with your eyes open, it allows you to be a master of your own security in ways that you just can't with the old fiat infrastructure. And again, it's early days for Bitcoin. The protection advantage fiat may enjoy now will diminish as similar infrastructure builds up around Bitcoin. But when it's available for Bitcoin, you can choose to pay and be protected, or you can choose to handle your own security and assume your own risk. Choices you don't have with fiat through credit cards, banks and Paypal, etc.
I would simply dispute that there was FDIC or the equivalent when cash was invented in China, nor were there legions of LEOs looking after cash rights as they would to protect the Emperor's gold. Those things evolved over time, and I'm sure at a much more leisurely pace than things are changing in the Bitcoin space.

I've had to go through the card stolen or lost procedure about a half dozen times. Each time involved more hassle than I would consider minor. Even worse, only one time was because I was the one that lost my card. All the other incidents were the result of some breach or problem on the credit card company's side. I think a lot of people would choose not to expose themselves to any of this *and* the associated costs if there was a way to simply opt out. Bitcoin has the potential to be that out.

I've heard that the current versions of MultiBit have dropped the import capability. The word is that if you need to do it right now, you should download and use an old version of MultiBit that still has the capability.  
If the absolute worst happened and Blockchain disappeared, I'd bet that someone would be able to create a tool which could take a Blockchain backup, the correct password and output the private keys. For all I know, this capability may already exist somewhere.

It's best not to store bitcoin anywhere you don't fully control the private keys. Although Coinbase seems to me to be a trustworthy company, when your bitcoin balance is there, you don't have true control of the funds (i.e. they could be siezed or if the company disappears, your funds are gone). Blockchain.info's wallet allows you to make a back up which would give you full control over your bitcoins, but they've been flaky in a multitude of ways since a major database outage last March.  
If you want a secure web wallet, I'd try one of these newcomers:

That's likely. If you're using Bitcoin Core, it'll tell you what fee it recommends (but by "recommends" it's really required). If you are using a recent copy of Bitcoin Core, you can choose to enable Coin Control. This allows you to manually choose coins of "higher priority" during a send (priority is just determined by coin age, older being higher priority). If you combine this with a small transaction size and a transaction amount over a certain limit, it's possible to send zero fee transactions. If you're interested, you can learn more here:

I was under the impression that if they create a self-adjusting fee mechanism it will be hardcoded into reference software (but likely not added to the protocol). I could easily be wrong about that.  
In any case, I think I have a better feel for your concerns based on the details you listed. My gut feeling, which is definitely not backed by any hard extrapolation or evidence, is that if Bitcoin is being used in 2140 it'll either be quite successful, or just a niche entity functioning on a relatively small scale. If it's successful, there will clearly be a lot of economic incentive in making sure the fee structure is such that the system remains health and inviolate. If the self-adjusting fee mechanism is carefully designed, this may not even need any tweaking. But if further adjustment is necessary it should be easily accomplished based on the manual fee adjustments we've already seen over the history of Bitcoin thus far. There should also be quite substantial amounts of fees available as a result of widespread Bitcoin use, which should equate to a good-sized and healthy hashing network.  
On the other hand, if Bitcoin is only a small player in 2140, I'm sure the mining/hashing network will have drawn down appropriately. Certainly the system may be much more vulnerable to attack, but it's niche size would probably make this an acknowledged and acceptable risk.
As an aside, I believe Gavin Andresen has said he has some mitigating code already prepared if 51% attacks ever become a thing. The code is not yet vetted or tested, but I recall him saying he doesn't consider this 51% attack risk very practical or realistic and thus polishing the code is considered a low priority. I'm hoping by 2140, someone will have had the time to implement that or even better preventative code so that large network power attacks are even less of a concern than they are now.

Not saying recovery won't have issues. Orphans will occur at high frequency and 51% attacks will be risky for separately running isolated networks. However, once the separate chains can see each other, the longest one wins. Legitimate orphaned transactions will be resubmitted to the longest chain, and Bitcoin continues on as it always has.  
I'm guessing recovery of legacy banking and economic systems would not go without bumps in the road as well, and I suspect, would not be usable as quickly.

1) Not sure why this is a problem. The coinbase reward is continuing to halve, and if Bitcoin use continues to increase, total reward *value* per block based on fees will increase. Difficulty and total hash rate will continue to self-adjust.  
2) Any reasonable fixed block size is not a *threat* to the payment system, but I agree with Gavin Andresen in his sentiment he expressed here:  
  
The lower 750 kB self-imposed limit just makes slower first confirmations and rising transaction fee competition start earlier.

I just scanned over it again. The one thing I'd add if it's missing is that you should try to use a printer that does not store what it prints in memory, or wipe the memory of your printer when you're done if it does.  
Basically, you never want the unencrypted private keys for cold storage to touch a system that is online (connected to any network). Also, once you're done, if any of the hardware you used to create your cold storage will subsequently go back online, make sure any remnants are cleared from RAM memory and non-volatile storage first (e.g. caches, temp files, archives, etc.)

You did 99% of the task correct, but just disconnecting your day-to-day computer when you created the paper wallets is not 100% safe, since malware may already exist on your computer that could have stolen your private key/and or passwords and then sent them out the next time your computer was connected to the Internet.  
That this could happen is quite unlikely, of course, but possible. To avoid this, download a copy of bitaddress.org to a USB FLASH drive, boot your computer offline from a Live CD like Ubuntu, load the offline copy of bitaddress.org in Firefox and repeat your paper wallet creation.

It seems to be a sensible question at first, and it's one that has been asked in this subreddit several times. But in such a catastrophic circumstance, the first order of business would be to get partial power and networking fixed to get emergency services and the economy functioning on basic levels. Any actions taken towards these ends would be pretty much the same as you would take to restore the Bitcoin network.

In a situation this dire, the only usable existing currency would be any physical fiat you happen to have on hand, and you'd better hope whoever you're transacting with values it the same as you do. You won't be able to withdraw from banks because they wouldn't be able to verify your deposits. Problems with Bitcoin would be the least of anyone's concerns.

2FA can't help you if the malware steals the encrypted wallet file and gets your password from the keylogger from your local computer. 2FA can only help you if the keys were held at the server, but then blockchain folding or someone at their company could steal your funds again.
EDIT: Blockchain does have a feature that adds a second password which authenticates when you try to send funds, but a keylogger could capture that password as well. And it's sort of beside the point, since once a thief has your private keys they could sweep your funds and then send them any way they like without using blockchain.info.

Over the years, they've struggled to build their traffic. This means that the players you do see there are regulars and are pretty die hard. As a result, the level of play seems pretty good. You won't run into large amounts of easy money the way you might have at some sites before Black Friday.

Welcome. You've basically got it. The point is Coinbase functions as a third-party that has full control of your funds when your bitcoins are in their wallet (in other words, Coinbase controls the private keys). This is not the best idea since your funds are at the mercy of Coinbase or an organization that can pressure Coinbase (e.g. the government). If Coinbase disappears or The Man says to freeze your funds, you could lose access. Coinbase is offering a newer service which gives you control of your private keys, but I haven't tried it yet and don't know much about it.  
On the other hand, a wallet like the one provide by Blockchain.info allows you to control your own private keys. There's two important things to keep in mind: 1) You must backup your keys at Blockchain.info, and 2) Make sure you've set up and activated Two Factor Authentication (2FA) at Blockchain.info *before* you send your funds there. I use the Google Authenticator app on my Android phone for 2FA, but others report the Authy app is also good. You can also use SMS instant messaging for 2FA, but this may be less secure.  
One more note, Blockchain.info has some great features and has been around a long time (in Bitcoin terms), but they've been fairly flaky in terms of service reliability since a major database outage they suffered last March. If this is a concern, you might want to check out two newer alternatives that offer multisig security, [Green Address]( or [BitGo](  
There are also local wallets that run on your desktop computer, and mobile wallets that run on smartphones and tablet computers. The [Choose Your Wallet page at Bitcoin.org]( lists quite a few.  
When you're ready to send funds from Coinbase, just have your receiving wallet create an address, and send the funds from Coinbase to that address.

I think there are several things to consider about this:
First, this analysis is old hat. The core developers are well aware of the growth of the blockchain. It's not a non-issue, but it's low on their list of priorities to address. I've seen some analysis that says the growth of storage and data handling capability due to Moore's Law will render this a non-concern. Is this correct? Maybe, maybe not, but there are also techniques that can be developed to optimize the storage and accessibility of the blockchain further. I believe the consensus is clearly that this aspect of Bitcoin is easily dealt with.
Second, your question of whether Bitcoin will survive in it's current form ignores the fact that Bitcoin is a growing, evolving, developing open-source entity. New innovations will always be incorporated into Bitcoin. Does this guarantee Bitcoin's survival? Absolutely not. But it does make it a moving target for challengers.
Third, even at present, for end-users not wishing to deal with the enormous size of the blockchain there are light-weight alternatives. The Electrum and Multibit client wallets are good, efficient choices. They provide arguably more functionality than the reference wallet client at a small cost of some lost decentralization. It should be noted, though, that each instance of these "lite" wallets also does not contribute to the Bitcoin network as the reference client and other "full" clients can.
Finally, Mt. Gox was/is a centralized exchange that has long exhibited bad management and iffy behavior. Failure of such organizations especially amid better competition is a necessary and healthy part of a free market. [This essay]( explains it quite well. It's important to note that the success or failure of organizations such as MtGox have no bearing on the integrity of Bitcoin as a protocol, though they may have some, hopefully short-term effect on its value as a unit of account.

Precisely. What is the "it" you are referring to? I took it to mean Bitcoin, which is what the entire discussion thread is about. When I point this out to you, you then bring altcoins into the discussion. You then continue to misdirect by stating you meant the technical feasibility of making a crypto-currency inflationary. None of your subsequent arguments make any sense in the context of your original statement.

For the most part, I believe you are correct. If the amount you are sending is 5,400 satoshis or larger, even with zero fee the transaction likely will eventually go through. Especially if it is repeatedly broadcast to the network every couple of days until it is accepted.  
But my understanding is based [on this post]( as well as a couple of others I've seen. They all say that transactions smaller than 5,400 satoshis or so likely will get rejected by miners regardless of fee, at present. This is referred to as the "dust limit" (I'm not sure if this an official term or not).

They don't seem to be very professionally run. I've seen lots of customer complaints mostly regarding slow deposit credits and withdrawals. If you're in the U.S. and really want to use an exchange, I think the only serious contenders are outside the U.S.: Bitstamp (pretty solid, in Slovenia with company presence in the U.K.) and BTC-e (dodgier, possibly located in Bulgaria, but been around for a while and doesn't require verification). In Bitstamp's case, you'll have to be comfortable sending verification data out of the country.

I guess it could be a chicken-and-the-egg situation. If no one trusts zero confirmation transactions, then no one accepts them, then there will be no reports of it happening. But I have a hard time believing a cafe will wait sometimes as much as an hour or more for a confirmation to occur before finishing the sale of a cup of coffee.
Mycelium has been promoting their "Transaction Confidence" feature, and I've heard that payment processors may use similar transaction checking. My understanding was this provides a method for quick transactions. I would've thought some percentage of merchants would choose to use this feature, and if risky, some percentage of sales would show up as double-spends.
@_date: 2014-02-20 05:09:46
In a lot of ways I think you are more right than wrong. The only things you really own, in a conventional sense, are the private keys. And, as you said, there's a chance someone else could create the same private key or keys. But the chance of this happening even once is a realistic impossibility. It's like quantum physics--when you throw a baseball at a concrete wall, by quantum physics there's a chance that it'll go straight through. I'm not expecting to see it happen in my lifetime, though.
So, now you own private keys. The bitcoins are in the network. Public addresses are the only things that can hold bitcoins. If there are some bitcoins in a public address that is paired with one of your private keys, owning that private key makes you absolutely the only one that can control those bitcoin. Is that ownership in the strictest sense? Maybe not, but it's absolutely near enough for me.

I'd say because that is a very misleading, if not bogus statistic. It apparently calculates the "cost per transaction" by taking the USD value of the block reward and dividing by the number of transactions. However, the vast majority of the block reward currently consists of newly mined bitcoins, part of the initial unit distribution function of the Bitcoin protocol. The value of newly minted bitcoins is not "charged" to anyone, and so is not truly a cost.  
The actual cost of a Bitcoin transaction (the "transaction fee") ranges from zero to a few tens of cents in USD. Typically, $0.04 USD at current valuations is enough to ensure a fast confirmation.

You know, you and I are probably in the same boat for this part, as I generally create paper cold storage wallets. So when I spend from one, I sweep the whole balance and then transfer any change to a new cold paper wallet. I've read about offline signing, but I've never done it myself.  
I did just check into it in a bit more detail. In Armory, for instance, you should be able to import your cold private key into the offline Armory client. It would likely treat this as a separate wallet apart from its normal deterministic wallet. From there, to complete the offline signing system, you'd have to be able to export the matching "watch-only" wallet to the paired online Armory instance. The only issue I can see here is that Armory would normally export a "Master Public Key" for the creation of the "watch-only" wallet. In your case, you wouldn't need the deterministic Master Public Key, you'd only need the single public key for your cold private key. Then you'd import that key to the online Armory client to create the watch-only wallet (assuming this is possible). You may need to check if "Expert Mode" allows this.  
As long as you can create the single public key watch-only wallet in the online Armory client, you should then be able to generate an unsigned transaction with a customized change address returning change back to the original public address (I understand that expert mode is a must for this step). You'd then transport the unsigned transaction across the air gap to the offline Armory computer using a USB Flash drive or printed QR code, etc., and then sign transaction offline. Finally, you'd bring the signed transaction back to an online computer and push the transaction to the network.  
I'm just now realizing the added complexity introduced from the cold storage wallet only having a single public/private pair. I'm now fairly sure you can't use Bitcoin Qt (now Bitcoin Core) to do this, since I don't think you can specify which public address you spend coins from when trying to generate the unsigned transaction. Armory *MAY* be able to do it, and the same is likely true of Electrum.  
If it turns out none of these methods will allow you to create a single public key watch-only wallet, you may be left with manually creating the unsigned transaction, or finding a tool kit such as Pybitcointools that might help to generate it. [This blog]( could help, but it's clearly quite complex. I'd hate to think you could never re-use an etched cold wallet and still maintain its "cold" nature, but I suppose that that is a possibility as well.
Hopefully someone here has had direct experience with this situation and can give you more specific advice.

Although it's feasible, it's not something you should do. When you create paper wallets for long-term storage they should be "cold", meaning they should have been created with no connection to the Internet, and not leaving any remnants of the created private keys that might later get exposed to the Internet (at least until they get swept to a hot wallet to be spent).  
If you were to export the private keys from a live Qt/Core wallet and make them into paper wallets, those could never be cold storage wallets, as the private keys would already have been exposed to Internet-connected systems.

There are innumerable incidents of customer funds being lost, but such losses are typically covered by the banks, credit card companies, merchants, or by FDIC insurance.

The problem with MtGox was that it had been throwing up red flags as poorly run and risky company for a long time, and the evidence was rapidly accelerating over the last six months to a year.
Bitcoin is new and revolutionary, but as such must be viewed as quite a risky investment. If you make the reasoned decision to try Bitcoin, realize also that day trading in Bitcoin (which is basically the only reason to ever leave your funds in an exchange) is vastly riskier still.
So assume you pass these two decision gates and proceed to dance on the razor's edge by trading in Bitcoin. From there, going on to ignore copious red flags must be then seen as yet another considered risk, or considerable negligence.
This all said, not all of the exchanges have nearly the sketchiness and poor record of MtGox. The current highest volume non-China exchange, Bitstamp, is comparatively transparent and has a decent reputation, if not better. This, plus the new push for fund verifiability and further transparency that has been fueled by the MtGox debacle should improve things considerably in the near future.

I would say the answer to that would be anyone's guess. As always, past performance is no guarantee of future returns. Right now, Bitcoin could be very over-bought or terrifically undervalued.
I do believe that relative to its promise as a new and disruptive technology, the current usage level is still quite low.
I think just about any currency or investment that exists in a free market is valued only at what someone will exchange for it. Fiat currency has not been "backed" by anything tangible for decades. In this way, I don't see Bitcoin as unique for not being "backed" by anything. To me, value is value, and I don't find arguments about supposed "intrinsic value" very convincing.
EDIT: In the long term, I'm sure that there will be some leveling out as current value growth is clearly not permanently sustainable. When that does happen, the volatility of Bitcoin should be dramatically reduced as well, and it should become much more usable as a currency. When this might happen is again open for speculation. I think the Bitcoin protocol is revolutionary in its use of a fully-trusted, decentralized consensus network that maintains a continuously validated public ledger. That it does this over an open peer-to-peer network whose members can be completely untrusted is more amazing still. Bitcoin as a unit of account--the digital currency--is just the first app on this new network, not unlike email when the Internet was still new. As to what this nascent technology can ultimately do, I bet we haven't seen anything yet.

He applied for the Japanese equivalent of bankruptcy, and of course Japan's laws apply there. However, Mt. Gox also applied for bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S. (Texas, for some reason, I believe). An early ruling in the U.S. case was that he was required to appear in person for that case to proceed. Now it appears, they have somehow proceeded without that.

Blockchain is just a name, it's really unrelated to the block chain data construct that underpins most crypto-currencies. There is no official "block chain" anything, much less a web site. You may be thinking of block explorers, which is largely what Blockchain.info is. There are many of these available, although none is an "official" one. Just Google "Bitcoin block explorer" for more options.

I hope I didn't present only one side of the argument. The fact is, Bitcoin is high risk, as the enormous returns to date show (only high risk investments tend to rise or fall this quickly in short periods of time).

The first thing I'd do in that situation is ask the person's full name, what department of the irs they work in, get a snail mail address of the building they work at, the phone number and extension. Then tell them that for verification you'll have to call him back. Next look up the irs building using a printed phone book or online at irs.gov. Call this number (which I suspect will *not* match the number the guy verbally gave you), and see if you can reach the extension he said he was at. If not, call an irs operator at that building to see if they have someone on staff matching the guy's name. If any of this verification fails, you'll know the guy is a scammer that he somehow got your phone number and other info.  
At that point you could just ignore future calls, or find a way to report the guy if you like. Do you have Caller ID, and if so what does it show when he calls?

There are built-in safeguards to prevent accidentally sending funds to a wrong address. It's difficult to screw up an address and get it accepted as a transaction. Most errors result from copying the wrong address, but the fact that the wrong address existed usually gives you the opportunity to contact the receiver too rectify things.  
In any case, this "fundamental flaw" is no different than with any other payment form, unless you include services like credit cards for which a fee is paid for coverage of fraud and the like.

Anyone who tells you Bitcoin will absolutely never fail is completely fooling themselves. No one can know. It's a grand experiment that is still in beta. The technology underpinning cryptocurrency in general is here to stay, but Bitcoin may not be.  
However, check out bitcoinpulse.com. I think the prospects for Bitcoin look good. Possibly as good they have ever looked.  
As to why the price dropped from $1163 to $340, I could only say the insane run up to the peak was unsustainable, just like in the previous 3 or 4 bubbles. I don't know why they happen, but if you look at each of them, they look remarkably similar. But after each bubble, crash, and recovery, the trend has been strongly upward. No guarantee this will continue, but I wouldn't be surprised.

Free escrow without the need to entrust funds to a third party (more generally, m-of-n multisignature transactions).  
Constructs such as colored coins and Open Transactions are being built on top of Bitcoin that will dramatically expand what is possible. Similar, competing technologies are also being developed elsewhere in the cryptocurrency space (e.g. Etherium, Protoshares), but these do not rely on Bitcoin.
Possibilities include fraud-free, auditable, anonymous global voting systems, tokens of virtual and physical property (deeds, etc.), and general distributed autonomous corporations/organizations (DACs/DAOs). Smart contracts and many centralized web services available now should be implementable in truly distributed, automated ways.

Although there are starting to be organizations providing bank-like services in Bitcoin, using them is optional. One of the benefits of Bitcoin is you can store your own balance and basically be your own bank. The difference is here, when you see a balance in your Bitcoin wallet, it's all there. That's what I assume 100% reserve means. When you see numbers in your bank account, only the amount you can actually access is what you control at any one time. The only reason these banks, as "safe institutions", need insurance is because their sordid history of failing and taking depositors' funds. FRB simply guarantees if more than 12% of fund holders try to get their money at any one time, this insurance *will* be called upon.  
Transporting Bitcoin has nothing to do with executing a transaction on the Bitcoin network. The same as driving cash from one end of the country to the other end in your car doesn't require an ACH transfer by banks. Transporting Bitcoin is *entirely* free.  
If your  refers to "Recordkeeping", the chart never claims it was free, nor do I make that contention. I just argue it's far better for the user than legacy systems.  
I'm not the author of the table, and the table doesn't say anything of the sort. It simply states that "Issuance" for Bitcoin is via algorithm instead of by physical mining or via politics. Why you would construe that to mean it implied human existence is based on algorithm is beyond me.  
How do those transacting in Bitcoin contribute anything other than mining/transaction fees towards "trillions in infrastructure and R&amp;D" (even assuming that hyperbole was close to accurate)? The answer is they do not. Only miners contribute to mining, and they do so *entirely by choice*. No one is forced into mining, and those transacting in Bitcoin only need pay optional recommended fees if they want to be assured of timely *confirmed* transactions. These fees are on the order of $0.03 USD per transaction today, and are due to drop significantly when "floating fees" are introduced.

STEP ONE: Backup your wallet.dat file!
TL;DR: That user fixed it by copying his Bitcoin data files to another location, uninstalling Bitcoin-Qt, copying the data files back to the original location, then resinstalling Bitcoin-Qt.
EDIT: [Here's another thread]( that indicates a -reindex may fix things.
@_date: 2014-05-16 03:12:08


That backup would allow you to access funds transferred to all addresses that existed in that wallet *at the time of the backup*. Bitcoin Core occasionally creates new addresses as needed, for instance for change addresses, or when you request new addresses. When the program is initially set up, it creates a large batch of addresses (it used to be 100), and those would all immediately be in the wallet.dat file. This means it would normally be some time before another batch was generated. I don't know the specifics of how many addresses Bitcoin Core generates in subsequent batches, however.

That's why I said an offline copy of bitaddress.org. If used offline, such as from a computer booted with a Ubuntu Live CD, the private key should still be secure.  
Of course, if you were on a computer connected to the Internet and typed the private key in to bitaddres.org, there's a chance the private key could get compromised.

Block discovery has a significant amount of randomness which is intended to average a block found every 10 minutes.

If that is the case, it does not yet seem well documented. I know SN posted that Bitcoin has a number of areas where it is vulnerable to DoS before he disappeared, though I'm not sure if this method we're discussing is one. Most apparently have gone unaddressed so far, as attacks haven't occurred much if at all.  
I suppose until attacks occur, any such issues will continue to be low priority. It still seems to me that hardening code running over 7k geographically distributed IPs would prove easier than solving a mass attack on only a handful.

True, but I haven't thought of a simple way to do that, short of carrying spare empty paper wallets.

Ah. Good deal, then.
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:17:41
Well the important parts of the transaction are digitally signed with your private key. If you submit it to the network and try to mutate an amount in the transaction, the hash of the mutated transaction will not match the originally submitted transaction, and miners will reject the mutated transaction. If you're asking about transaction malleability, that only allows mutating specific *unsigned* portions of a transaction, such as a particular transaction ID, this *can* still be done, but not with most wallet software. You'll need to use with lower level code or tools to accomplish that.  
However, transaction malleability is an issue that has largely been dealt with. If you're hoping to mutate a transaction in such a way as to fool a bitcoin company like Coinbase or Bitpay or an exchange like Bitstamp, I'm pretty sure you'll find this is now impossible.

In a free market, there will always be wealth disparity. The difference here is, Nakamoto made it free for everyone to join from day one. That not everyone did cannot be blamed on Bitcoin.

No one said Bitcoin *adds* trust. The parent comment implies Bitcoin solves a trust problem. I can see that this is true in several ways. When you make a Bitcoin transaction, you don't need to trust the merchant and anyone else along the way with access credentials allowing charges to be placed on your account. The data passed in a Bitcoin transaction also does not need to be recorded or stored by the merchant, and would be useless if stolen. You can't be overcharged, or charged erroneously by a merchant after a Bitcoin transaction is sent. No validation or verification information is required by a merchant in addition to the Bitcoin transaction data itself, whereas in a debit, credit or Paypal transaction, assorted such private information must be provided to the merchant, and then you've got to trust that they will keep your information safe in perpetuity.  
If you are seeking a guarantee system which would provide a similar function to chargebacks, Bitcoin's programmable nature offers many options. Also, there's no reason why service providers could not build credit-type systems on top of Bitcoin if the market demand arises.

The refund ability you write about is a service provided by your credit card company that you pay for. And the service fee collected is only part of the total cost of using credit cards. If you truly think that this cost and the associated financial system friction introduced by credit cards is tiny, then simply forget about Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies (at least for this purpose).  
However, let's consider exactly what these total costs are. In the best of cases, credit card companies charge merchants between 1.6% - 3.0% of the purchase price as a service fee. In other countries or in other use-cases, these fees are much higher. Although these fees are often masked from the consumer, they drive prices up and are a drag on merchants' profits. In fact, in many cases cash purchases subsidize these costs. Even if you wanted to avoid these fees you can't in a lot of situations.  
Then there's the cost of rampant credit card fraud to merchants, banks, and credit card companies. Again these losses largely wind up as higher prices and fees that customers must pay.  
Don't forget the costs associated with identity theft caused by the insecure nature of the antiquated credit card systems in use. The cost of dealing with this problem directly affect both merchant and customer.  
Finally, there are the legal and law enforcement costs associated with dealing with credit card fraud. These costs manifest on one side has higher prices, and on the other as higher taxes or reduced funds for other governmental services.  
Bitcoin is still nascent and experimental, but it has the potential to dramatically reduce costs and friction from financial services and the economy in general. And this is just considering one narrow aspect of its capabilities.

To be sure in a local trade, always use the provided escrow, or arrange your own multisig alternative.  
There are many solutions for shorter settlement times, but all current or upcoming options compromise some of Bitcoin's native security or decentralization. One example would be for a seller and buyer to both use Coinbase's wallet. Then the bitcoin transfer between Coinbase wallets could be confirmed instantly (though escrow would be left out in this scenario).  
If you stick with a native Bitcoin transaction, I think waiting for six confirmations is excessive. One or two is probably plenty for typical amounts. Three or four is reasonable for somewhat larger amounts (remember each subsequent confirmation increases the security of the transaction exponentially).  
If using escrow, you could see if the seller would be willing to fund the escrow before the meet. Once you see that escrow is funded, there should be plenty of confirmations by the time you actually meet the seller. Then just show the cash and independently verify that escrow is released. The transaction itself would be essentially instantaneous. 
Regarding anonymity, regulated exchanges like Circle and Coinbase will always need to bow to the AML/KYC terms of the jurisdictions they operate in. You could always attempt to anonymize your coins after you receive them. Or if anonymity is your goal, you may consider a sketchier exchange like [BTC-e]( which does not do verification of its users, though you'd still be trusting them not to log how your account was funded or that they're not infiltrated by the NSA. The surest way to preserve anonymity is probably still to mine your own bitcoins, but this would almost certainly be more costly then buying from Coinbase or Circle. You'd also need to take necessary steps to stay anonymous while mining (i.e. when buying ASICs, dealing with mining pools, etc.), and actually getting the bitcoins would be a long-term proposition.

I agree that in the short term, any replacement technology will likely be more expensive. But the blockchain storage problem is not a short term problem. As another poster already noted in this thread, even at current storage levels, the predicted size of the blockchain can be handled for a long time. It could be more costly and troublesome, but definitely not unmanageable.  
Considering all the possibilities that result from advance in new storage technologies together with potential efficiencies gains resulting from new code to reduce blockchain storage requirements, to me it seems likely that *some* solution to future data storage issues will be found.

Never used Mycelium yet myself, but I just wanted to comment that though your posted method may be safer storage than most, it probably can't be considered truly "cold" storage. It's only *really* "cold" when the private key was generated on a non-Internet connected device *and* the device the key was created on is safely wiped of private key remnants before later being reconnected to the Internet.  
This is why the booting from a Live CD and using an offline copy of bitaddress.org is often recommended.
Still, the difference is small, since the only place your key may have been exposed is if there's malware on your Android device, or if you typed the password for your encrypted key into the computer you printed the paper backup from (and that computer was infected by malware).
EDIT: I just realized there's a bit more concern, since your Android device is presumably still connected to the Internet and you will be continuing to use it "live". The password and private key can be exposed in the future if your Android device is ever infected with malware down the road. Best just to keep relatively small amounts on it. Don't confuse the Mycelium paper wallet with paper wallets used for truly cold storage.

That is not my argument, but your interpretation of it. Explicitly, my point is information included in an encyclopedia article should be evaluated for pertinence and be free of bias. Just because something may be sourced and so might justify inclusion if that were the only consideration does not mean all such information is included. Clearly the same can be said of all the examples I listed earlier, but the corresponding statements are omitted because they are not pertinent to the subject of the article. If you wanted to include a blurb about how cash, credit cards, and more recently, Bitcoin, has been used in CP circles, it would clearly be pertinent and belong in the Wikipedia CP article. The same does not belong in the Bitcoin article, just as it does not belong in the cash, credit card, or Tor articles.

I'm not trying to bring in any ideology. The fact is that Bitcoin has a known, provable scarcity. Items that are scarce and useful generally have rising valuations. Interest is only required if you submit your fiat funds to a bank system. Then it manifests as another way they can take value away from you that you would otherwise be entitled to, as you are then locked into a fiat system *without* known, provable scarcity.  
Bitcoin is definitely highly volatile, but anyone fixating on Bitcoin losing 60% value in the last 12 months is not being objective without also considering how much its valued changed from just a month earlier than that, or over any longer time scale.

It stores data, most efficiently as hashes, but it's the first to do it in an immutable, self-verifying, and decentralized way.  


Sure, doing this internally for your company with 500 employees is pretty affordable. But even then you've got to maintain and back up the server, ensure the other elements needed for high availability, and pay for infrastructure and staff. Now try to make the same data globally accessible, consistent, and with borderless availability and traffic capacity that matches the Bitcoin block chain. That's far from cheap.  


Development is significantly simplified and costs are far less, because the question of distributing the data, verifying it, and ensuring that forgeries are impossible is now a non-issue. All those functions previously required costly development, and this work was and is often duplicated across organizations as a result of the conventional closed-architecture and security mindset.  


In the simplest block chain-based ticketing implementation, the service provider only needs to check that the hash exists on the block chain, based on address information the ticket holder provides, and that the hash verifies ticket information also provided by the ticket holder. No other data needs to be stored anywhere. Any other complexity that requires further data can be added and stored elsewhere (perhaps in a decentralized way in the future), but that goes beyond the e-ticketing function.  


Scalability on the *Bitcoin* block chain is an unsettled issue, but even today with 1 MB blocks there still is plenty of capability available for small businesses to leverage the technology. For larger implementations right now, the Bitcoin blockchain could become uneconomical depending on traffic required and on possibly upcoming scalability developments. But Bitcoin is not the only block chain. Altcoins may be used, though all have significantly less security and global availability than Bitcoin's block chain. Should side chains become available, alternative block chains can be anchored to the strength of Bitcoin.  
But the advantages and usefulness offered by block chains are already clear, which is increasingly becoming realized by large companies like Nasdaq, IBM, major banks, etc. Already, Bitcoin is the open-source block chain with the most development and innovation towards greater scalability. Companies like Factom are offering innovative ways to leverage data on the block chain while minimizing footprint. If use rises to the point that fees increase, this will drive such development even faster.  


Small businesses or blockbuster movies that sell 100 million tickets, pick your goal posts.   
I'm not saying Bitcoin today is instantly the solution to all things everywhere, but it absolutely represents a new potential solution that is open, accessible to everyone, and *already* is the most reachable provider of self-verifying, immutable data worldwide. For all sorts of commercial and economic innovation, it's a new path that did not previously exist.  
The fact that the block chain technology Bitcoin introduced can and is being duplicated at whim guarantees that scalability will always be dealt with in one way or another. Even if transaction growth on the Bitcoin block chain outpaces increased availability from both rapidly improving computing/networking/storage technology, and all other developments regarding scalability (which, given the pace of innovation and VC investment is definitely not a sure thing), as the strongest and largest such network, widespread use of other permisionless block chains will only serve to illustrate why a price premium would be reasonable for transacting on the strongest, most established chain. Therefore, should these circumstances arise, it's reasonable to anticipate Bitcoin would become the network for higher value transactions, for which the highest security and most available network are needed, and where any higher fees can be justified.  
All of the forgoing presupposes that Bitcoin will continue to exist and grow well into the future, something that can't be determined with any certainty at this early stage of its existence. But its immense promise coupled with the uncertainty of its future shed insight on the extreme volatility and massive value growth bitcoin price has exhibited over its early years.

If so, I'm thinking the only way this could have been done is if they figured out a way to spoof a session that appears to Blockchain's servers to  be within the time limit and other parameters so that it will not request 2FA again. If this is the case, there may be a hole in Blockchain's security protocols here (for instance, to reject a spoof attempt Blockchain's server should at least double-check the source IP and request 2FA again if the IPs don't match--even if any other session credentials appear to be right).

You have the right idea, but I'd phrase it that the person that holds the private key controls the coins at the associated address. Specifically, a signature from the private key is required to spend any unspent transaction outputs (utxo's) that were sent to the associated address.  


Only a signature is required. In fact, that's how hardware Bitcoin wallets like Trezor and Ledger keep their balances secure or "cold", by making sure the private keys themselves are never exposed to the Internet.  


She does not, because anyone that knows an address can check the balance of utxo's on the block chain. The private key is only ever needed to generate new signatures (or to re-generate the public key and/or address if required).

The best ways to buy are probably [Circle]( and [Coinbase]( Both require verification, though, so I'm not sure if you can buy instantly (or how much you can buy) as a new user.  
If you need to buy instantly, you can check [LibertyX]( to see if there's a location near you (if there is one, call ahead to make sure they do QPay billpay service without any extra fees; follow LibertyX's instructions closely). [Bitquick.co]( and [LocalBitcoins]( are also options. And you can search for a Bitcoin ATM/BTM/vending machine near you on [Coin ATM Radar]( (always call ahead to the location to make sure the machine hasn't moved and is in working order).  
You can also make an appointment to make an in-person order through [CoinCafe](

Oh, don't get me wrong, I think even now in the US, there's more than enough speed.

You're right. When I had checked it before, I just roughly eye-balled the chart. But looking at it more closely, the recovery from the worst crash in Bitcoin's history took 19-20 months to recover. See here:  
  
Still, if you bought in at any other time and held at least just one year, you would not have lost money.

It could be done. But what is the effectiveness of the attack and its benefit? And how easy is it for Bitcoin to workaround the attack? And how do you justify the $1B expense to taxpayers?  
And, by the way, the cost would not be only $1B, but you'd have to calculate the opportunity cost lost since you could instead use all that hashing power to mine and make a nice profit.  
I find it to be an extremely unlikely scenario, but it is not impossible to execute. It's a risk that everyone must weigh according to their own best judgement.

If they were standardized to be used only for this purpose, the private key could be printed in invisible magnetic ink readable only by machines using an open-source standard (such as existing check reading machines at cash registers), or included in some other visibly obscured manner on such purpose-made paper wallets. Although this would require an Internet or SMS connection on the vendor side, it would eliminate the need for a centralized issuer of IOUs.  
If this were to be implemented, it seems to me it would be less difficult than writing a check, and nearly be on a par with using cash.

Wow, that sounds *serious*! Maybe the giftcard sellers or suppliers should only sell them for cash, huh? Or if they do sell them via credit card transactions, maybe they should undertake more serious verifications, because otherwise *they're just costing themselves money when they're on the hook for the losses*. Hey, or even better, maybe they should just outlaw all giftcards *and* invalidate all of the existing ones, *amirite*?  
But even if none of the above comes to pass, businesses and individuals that have *perfectly legal* giftcards should still be able to use them, right? So unless your burning, zero-day, sock puppet troll concern has compelled you to invent a way that anyone accepting giftcard funds can instantly determine if the person offering them is the criminal that committed fraud to get it, *and* due to your concern for your fellow man, you're willing to offer this innovation to the world for free, I see no problem with Purse.io's present use of them.

Those were services were proposals that don't really work because most miners do not follow their protocols. The websites still exist, but as far as I know, they don't currently function as advertised.
@_date: 2015-05-09 22:58:01
That's interesting. I think it's possible, but it would be a very risky and uncertain bet. The attacking miner would need to weigh the possible returns versus what he could earn by using the same capital elsewhere. For pools, I think this is particularly unlikely, since they'd also be risking their main line of business should their spamming get discovered.  
Large solo miners (or perhaps like-minded private pools) may not have this concern, but they'd still need to be convinced that returns from higher fees would more than offset any (possibly temporary) drop in exchange rate that might result from Bitcoin users seeing sudden block congestion and higher transaction fees. It's also very likely this would be a short-term play, since it would quickly motivate the development of countermeasures in Bitcoin. If they were to use the same capital and just re-invest in their existing venture (or even some other, less uncertain investment) they wouldn't need to plan on potentially getting countered by the community.

It feels like there's some kind of fairly new malware or social engineering attack targeting Blockchain.info wallets. I've seen a good handful of these posts over the last week or two.

True anonymity in Bitcoin is not yet ready for prime time. But if and when it is, you still may not want to purchase your bitcoins from a broker like Circle because it would be such a well-documented entry point.  
What you seek might not really be available until something like Darkwallet is fully tested and mature, and even then obtaining bitcoins in a few purchases via LocalBitcoins or the like, or perhaps even mining your own bitcoins, would be better anonymity starting points. Right now, trying to maintain anonymity in Bitcoin transactions takes a lot of work and exposes your coins to significant third-party risk.

They can claim to be using protocols and patterns in choosing those they target, but they have no incentive to minimize false positives. While I'd admit it can be suspicious if someone were to regularly break up large transactions into sub-$10k pieces, there are also those who are completely legitimate but would prefer to deal with IRS or the government as little as possible just to save the hassle.  
The point is, though, both the sub-$10k and over-$10k transactions now can be used to justify government seizure of accounts. Basically, they can seize anyone's funds at any time. Of course you can protest afterwards at great expense and inconvenience (which causes financial injury that should be a crime in itself), but if you do so you still only have a *chance* of seeing your funds returned.  
I fully agree with your final sentiment. This is government perpetrated theft and extortion. Where is the legal logic to exclude something as simple as probable cause from the process?

Name a single other financial system that was used live, in the real world with limitless zero fee transactions that allowed value transfers at the time as small as a billionth of a U.S. cent, *and still worked*.  
Though, my understanding is both limits were put in place preventatively, before either issue drove up costs to legitimate users too much. If we take your argument then, Bitcoin is the most tested microtransaction system in the world. It functioned as intended on the Internet (not even just when restricted to testnet) while bulk, unsolicited, basically valueless transactions (essentially messages) were sent across it.

Bitcoin Core 0.9.1 doesn't in my experience. When I send a transaction and let Core choose my inputs automatically, fees tend to be required and sometimes they seem quite high (like the old 0.8.6 fees). However, when I use Coin Control and manually select my inputs that have significant coin age, I've sent a zero fee transaction that got picked up within one or two blocks just in the last week.

If the bank and or Paypal do restore your funds if the seller does not send BTC, then the seller has just defrauded one or the other organization.

A lot of people hear about the incredible growth in Bitcoin's valuation over the last five and a half years and immediately think it must be a Ponzi scam or pyramid scheme.  
Ironically, the volatility that Bitcoin exhibits as an emerging  currency is an indication that it is *not* such a scheme, as most Ponzi or pyramid schemes claim to provide constant, large returns. You seldom if every hear of an actual scam that periodically dropping its value or returns as much as 60 - 95%, since such behavior would not provide enough of a consistent draw to fuel the continuing con. Bitcoin has exhibited such drops regularly after each spike/bubble.  
Almost everyone that spends the time to learn about Bitcoin's fundamentals realizes that it simply *does not meet* the definition of either a Ponzi scam or pyramid scheme. I have yet to hear a convincing argument from those that continue to maintain their conviction even after understanding how Bitcoin works.

If by standard bitcoin wallet you mean Bitcoin Core (formerly Qt), that wallet is capable of importing a private key, so you aren't forced to use a provider based wallet if you don't want to. Some feel Blockchain.info or Mycelium make importing a private key easier, but you can type or copy/paste your private key into Bitcoin Core using the importprivkey command in the Help &gt; Debug window &gt; Console tab.  


I know the Blockchain.info wallet can handle multiple addresses, but I'm not sure how it handles change. It's possible you can specify the change address you would like used.  


As long as you're sure each copy is stored securely, multiple copies are a good idea. If you store encrypted private keys, that's even safer. Just don't forget or lose the password. You can also choose to employ Shamir's Secret Sharing (available using the Split Wallet feature on bitaddress.org) which allows you to store your private keys distributed over several places. You need to combine some number (e.g. at least 2 out of 3) to access the stored funds.  
Use some common sense -- if you store multiple copies of an unencrypted private key, it's actually somewhat less secure overall than the just least securely stored copy. In other words, you're increasing the surface area or opportunity for theft. So a few copies might be good as backup, but too many would be risky.
@_date: 2014-10-19 15:55:58
Agreed. A counter party giving you a private key is not a useful function. Private keys need to be known only by the wallet owner to be truly safe.

You might be able to invest in companies involved with Bitcoin, but you can't invest in "stock for Bitcoin" because there is no central organization or company that represents or controls it. Bitcoin is a decentralized protocol. Purchasing and holding bitcoins themselves would probably be the closest thing to investing in Bitcoin the protocol/payment network. Even investing in the largest company players in the Bitcoin space would be difficult right now, as most are still private companies operating on venture capital funding.

You'd need to open port 8333 all the way to your external IP. So if the PC running Armory and Bitcoin Core has a firewall, that needs to allow 8333. Then your router also needs to be set to port forward 8333 to the PC running Armory and Bitcoin Core.

The technical distinction between 'hot' and 'cold' is whether the held private keys have any exposure to the Internet. Highly used wallets generally have the private keys constantly connected to the Internet, and are thus 'hot'. 'Cold' storage completely isolates private keys from any exposure to the Internet *ever*.  
If someone goes through the trouble of using something like a Trezor or Ledger hardware wallet for every transaction, that could be both highly used and essentially 'cold' at the same time.

You should understand that the physical coins which "contain" bitcoins are really just novelties or collectibles. They are not more secure than just possessing the purely digital bitcoins. In fact, a physical coin that has a private key implanted by the coin minter presents an addded security risk, since you must trust the minter to not have retained a copy of the private key before selling it to you.

Bitcoin is the first real-world solution for achieving trust-less distributed consensus. This means it creates a secure network over which trusted information is shared and validated even though you don't need to place any trust in the individual members/peers of the network. This is a unique and arguably revolutionary invention which will see many uses, of which bitcoin the digital currency is but the first (not unlike email over the invention that was the Internet.)  
As a digital unit of value/payment network, Bitcoin excels in many ways when compared with contemporary alternatives, and therefore, a growing number of people are using it. However, the actual value of bitcoin arises from the people that use it. If no one were to use bitcoin its value would be essentially zero. And as the number of people that do use it and find it beneficial grows, in general its value can be expected to increase as well.  
This has been reflected in its generally rapid value growth over the last 5.5 years, but there have been cyclical spikes during this overall growth trend. Following each spike there's been a dramatic fall, and the last such spike was late last year. Whether Bitcoin's valuation growth will continue is anyone's guess, but if you're interested, you should research Bitcoin's fundamentals and see if you think it may have any potential. Then make your own decisions on whether Bitcoin is "backed" by anything.

The only file you should save is wallet.dat, in case you ever need to go back and check your old private keys. But if you've already deleted everything and your funds are already in Electrum, you're fine also.

Even limited to only 1 MB blocks (actually, about ~732 kB in most cases), the network seemed pretty resilient to me. Anyone that needed to get a transaction in the next block during the test could have just paid a slightly higher than normal fee.  
The longer such high traffic lasts, the more incentive there is for miners to react to maximize their profit. In the event of a long term attack, this would quickly evolve into a way to funnel the attacker's funds into miners' pockets.

I think I'm among the majority of Bitcoin users who would disagree with this. For cold storage purposes, most individual paper wallets are single keypair items. Even if multiple keypairs are present in a single paper wallet, they would still be imported one at a time to be swept for use.  
This still does not explain why you feel Bitcoin Core/Qt cannot manage imported private keys properly, or why you contend Armory is a better solution.
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:40:46
Understandable concern. If you prefer to do it all yourself, Bitcoin is perfectly suitable to that as well. Just recognize that Bitcoin is really just cash on the Internet. If you do it yourself, you'll need to care for your own security and accounting as well point-of-sale, etc.
If you want to get started immediately, simply print out a QR code for a public address to your Bitcoin wallet and use that to accept payment. You will need to manually convert the fiat cost to bitcoin and give the total to the customer. The cashier would then need to be able check Blockchain.info or another block explorer to see the payment arrive at the receive address. I've already heard of one scam with this method though via hijacking of the printed QR code. You'd have to guard and verify that the displayed QR code is really yours. Anyone can create their own and paste it over or replace your QR code and intercept your customers' payments.
Perhaps a better method would be to use a wallet like Mycelium on an Android tablet. I've heard that they will soon be offering a display by percentage of how confident you can be in accepting zero confirmation payments.

I second everyone's cold paper wallet advice, but I'm surprised no one suggested buying your bitcoin from Coinbase.com since you mentioned you are in the US. If you don't mind ID verification, Coinbase may be the only way to buy and sell bitcoins via ACH transfer to and from your bank account currently in the US. If you provide a Visa card as a backup payment avenue, they even offer a certain amount of instant purchase per day.  
As with any Bitcoin service that holds your funds, it's good practice not to leave your bitcoins there longer than necessary. Once your purchase completes, transfer your bitcoins to a wallet that you have full control over. If you do use a paper wallet, transferring directly to the paper wallet's public address would be a good way to prevent loss or theft.
@_date: 2014-04-02 09:42:10
There are mistakes that can cause loss, but I don't know how "easy" they are to make. Most steps have at least some built-in safeguards to prevent accidents. If you're concerned, do some test runs with small amounts to understand the process before importing your high value wallet.  
Visit bitaddress.org and make all the BIP38 encrypted wallets you want. Fund some with some fractions of millibits and try importing them to Blockchain.info's My Wallet.

Certainly the costs associated with such ticketing systems rise with the size and complexity of the implementation. Personally, most single independent theaters I've been to still use legacy systems, but *movie chains* are multimillion dollar operations that have integrated systems, and *still* likely pay a service provider that has done the development, deployment, testing, and back-end infrastructure work necessary to provide consistent, reliable service within their service area.  
If you start talking about nationwide or international train companies, or international airlines complexity and costs skyrocket, largely due to the infrastructure required to support such services.
It's true that new services like Passwallet and Passbook are springing up which are starting to make services more accessible, however [fees are inevitably attached]( privacy is lost, and you are chained to a centralized provider that can hold you hostage to their service and are likely not backed by a widespread global network of service nodes.  
A block chain-based system, on the other hand, is instantly global with tremendously high availability. There is no cost to maintain or pay for server development, deployment, testing, mirroring, high-availability, data backup, bandwidth, security, cross-border regulations, etc., etc. There's no upgrading of software, patching of vulnerabilities, migration to new hardware, or paying of the staff which handles such things. And the back-end is completely independent, so no third-party is harvesting private information as part of the cost of offering the service. Nor can the block chain arbitrarily restrict or change your service.  


Citation please? These large companies certainly started their efforts for electronic ticketing systems 5, 10, even 15+ years ago. Imagine what the development costs have come to over the years. I wouldn't be surprised if the hosting costs for such services are in the multimillions per year, not to mention maintenance costs.  
Now, any tiny company can leverage the block chain to build similar systems in possibly weeks, definitely within months. And be backed by a global network that can give them access to their records with unprecedented availability.
Even today, I'm sure development costs are continuing for big companies as well, since service areas grow and contract with business changes and international politics. The block chain gives you the possibility of skirting most if not all of these issues.  


None of this is related to the pure ticketing aspect that OP suggested. You can of course build any further complexity you want on top of a block chain-based ticketing system. It's possible that some or all of that could be done in a decentralized way in the future, but ticketing is essentially available right now.

The reason I don't find the intrinsic value argument compelling is that a commodity's supposed intrinsic value is just as variable as any other aspect of it's value. Take gold for instance. Some say its intrinsic value is its use in jewelry and electronics. What is the true utility offered here compared to other materials? Does it represent a significant portion of gold's valuation? How much value is ascribed to these "intrinsic" parts of gold's nature can vary dramatically according to a community's uses for it. A subsistence farming community may find far less "intrinsic" value in gold as opposed to seed, grain or fertilizer. The vast majority of gold's market value is that which it has attained as a speculative commodity. So much so that I would argue any intrinsic aspect, if it even exists, can be considered negligible.
And that's also why I contend fiat is not backed by any *tangible* asset. You can say it's backed by "collective weight" or "backed by full faith and credit of a government", but those concepts in themselves are highly subjective. What is truly "intrinsic" about any of that? How those aspects are regarded are highly variable and completely at the whim of the perception of people or communities.

The difference is, your examples are organizations that have either spent tens or hundreds of millions of dollars developing these systems and continue to spend to maintain and service them in the limited localities where their services are available, or they are paying organizations that have done this so that they can have this capability on an ongoing basis. Whereas using the block chain, any small organization or even start-up now has the ability to do the same things *but globally* with vastly less development and no ongoing maintenance costs *while enjoying higher availability*. It's just another example of how this new technology lowers or removes barriers to entry.

Be happy to.  
Right now proof/certificates/tokens of your identity are just items issued by some central organization and constructed to their specifications to have various levels of verifiability and immunity to counterfeiting. Those are exactly a block chain's strengths.  
Today, if a cop pulls you over and checks your license, or an immigration officer inspects your passport, they're just trying to confirm the document's authenticity, then they can refer to the information on the item itself, or to data tied to the number on the item. Well, what if you used fictitious IDcoin or PassportCoin instead? Any time verification is needed by someone presented with either of these crypto replacements, you could sign with your private key (something you would possess, just as you currently possess the physical license or passport, etc.), and instantly the person seeking verification knows you are who you say you are and that the data linked is verified and uncorrupted.  
These crypto replacements would also be much more extensible and capable then their current physical counterparts. You could tie official pictures, the digital data of which is hashed and tied to your private key. You could arbitrarily add any other biometrics, such as fingerprint representations or even hashes of your DNA. Each such characteristic can use cryptographic principles to allow verification but also protect privacy.  
Going further down this rabbit hole, what if a hash of your DNA was your private key? Except in the case of identical siblings or clones, this would be a pretty good solution. Imagine tying all your medical data and history to this as well. Your tax history. Your citizenship records. It goes on and on.  
Now imagine what DAC's and DAO's can accomplish provided they are authorized to access and or change various elements of this data.  
EDIT: I guess the important point is that any method that is adopted would need to become the agreed upon convention for that purpose. If all agencies accepted IDcoin instead of a driver's license, I think the goal is accomplished.
I hope I'm answering your question. If not let me know.

Isn't it true that if the profit incentive drops (as it is likely to do eventually as block rewards keep getting halved) that there will be less energy and hardware committed to mining? And in that case, the bitcoin protocol will automatically reduce difficulty so that a block is still mined about every 10 minutes regardless of overall hashing power. I don't see this being much of a factor in Bitcoin's overall success.

@_date: 2015-05-10 01:17:03
Let's have it your way. Say this attack starts and there's a massive, unprecedented crash in Bitcoin value (I don't believe this myself for a second, but suspending my disbelief, let's say this happens). What happens after that? If the attacker stops, the disruption is over, agreed? So he continues to attack cheaply.  
Now miners have a choice. The value of their bitcoin has gone to near zero. They could pack up and go home accepting their nearly complete losses. But what happens if some of them continue to mine? Initially, they'll be operating at a loss. But assuming a large number of miners have left, difficulty will plummet at the next adjustment. (At this point it's fair to say if enough miners defect, a hard fork difficulty adjustment might be required to get things rolling again -- to me this is another *extremely* remote possibility). From this point on, it's that positive feedback loop again. The attacker needs to keep attacking to keep Bitcoin disrupted, but doing so makes their attack more costly and adds value to Bitcoin. And again, as soon as the attacker stops, no more disruption *and* Bitcoin is worth whatever amount *more* than before the attack. If markets could not anticipate, this would mean the valuation of bitcoin would shoot up massively from near zero to *more* than it was worth before the attack. But markets *can* anticipate, so these extremes would not occur. Value *would not* drop to near zero on commencement of such an attack. It could drop a little, it might not drop at all. It could be argued that it might even go up a little because the end game is obvious. Likewise, when the attack stops, price won't go rocketing up from near zero because market anticipation will have priced in the possibilities long before.

Thinking more about your original question, though, I think I'm getting your point I originally missed.

The answer is no, unless a hard fork code change is made to add this behavior.  
Philosophically, though this would be a gray area since it could be implemented not to exceed the 21 million unit total, but just to approach it more closely.

Simplistic analysis. Under such an attack, fees would rise so those that still need to send transactions could.

Yeah, nothing in the USB range is workable as far as I know right now, and Spondoolies are pricey, but the [wiki]( lists the S5's market price at $370 (add ~$90 for a reasonable power supply). The Amazon listing I saw wasn't this cheap, and likely your options will be further limited. But I think it's the most efficient SHA256 miner right now, and it's an order of magnitude cheaper than a lot state-of-the-art miners were just months ago.

Further small businesses will be disincentived to join as it gets more uneconomical. At the same time, the rising popularity of the Bitcoin block chain will be raising the popularity of permissionless altcoin and sidecoin (if they exist by that time) block chains so that they become even more viable alternatives.

Well, if there really was only a single bitcoin or less in circulation, at today's valuation, the valuation would still be the same $5 or $6 billion market capitalization.

Central banks support going cashless because it facilitates enacting policies such as negative interest rates and bail-ins. Citizens would be left with few if any options to avoid onerous monetary tactics.  
This would also make it easier for regulations to prevent the exchange of the digital-only fiat for Bitcoin (or really any other alternative store of value). Subsequently, bitcoin could only enter such economies via mining, or secondarily via direct exchange for goods and services.  
On the bright side, if I was stuck in such a predicament, I'd be highly motivated to find any way to escape central bank jail. Bitcoin would look awfully good as a refuge.

Yes, but OP's question was why bitcoins can be stolen, but his online bank account is not vulnerable. It's clear online accounts have been vulnerable, whether by social engineering or any other hack. The same comparison standards should be applied between Bitcoin and online banking in this instance (i.e. bitcoin losses sometimes result from successful social engineering attacks, but the perception seems to be that this is Bitcoin's fault.)  
I completely agree with your sentiment that Bitcoin businesses should strive to do far better, especially than the lowest common denominator in either industry.

I could see that if there were more "closed loop" transactions in the Bitcoin economy that things would grow faster. Unfortunately, I don't know of a way to "drop in" that sort of adoption.
As it is, Bitcoin is in its infancy, yet all indicators are that it is growing and getting accepted quite rapidly. For boosters and detractors both, I think a little patience is warranted before drawing conclusions about how things will actually end up.

Viewed purely as a currency, the answer in most cases is probably yes *at this point in time*. However, Bitcoin is in its infancy. Volatility should reduce as it matures. And even now, Bitcoin is remarkably useful. Though businesses that want to implement it today for its abundant beneficial characteristics need to be mindful of issues such as volatility, other businesses such as Bitpay, Coinbase, Circle, Coinapult, etc., view such growing pains as opportunities to be capitalized upon. From the influx of VC money, growing numbers of investors appear to agree.

I hope sales with these kinds of discounts *can* be sustained for a while. Merchants save more than just from fees, there's also the complete elimination of credit card fraud costs. This leads to the realization that Bitcoin transactions add directly to the bottom line, so businesses quickly move to drive more of their customers towards Bitcoin use. If they are successful, they can save more money to add to the bottom line. And finally, there's the buzz businesses get in PR for being among early adopters. The more such sales they announce, the more they ride this free PR wave.
@_date: 2014-04-17 06:41:34
Yeah, it's not great. I wonder what Coinbase and Bitpay are doing about this with regards to their PoS systems. Hopefully, it's a transitory situation, though. As more miners adopt 0.9 standards, this should go away, at least until completely dynamic fees are implemented.  
EDIT: I presume checking for an adequate fee can be part of an acceptance standard in a PoS, and it may already be implemented this way. Still, it's an awkward situation to handle if you have a customer that sends a transaction with less than the required fee.

You would only get paid twice if you received the original payment but realized that the TXID had been changed in the transaction. You would then have to contact MtGox claiming that you never received the payement. Gox would have to fail to notice that your address already received the funds but instead search the block chain for the original TXID, fail to find it, and then re-send payment from new coins.
Although this is possible, I haven't heard of any confirmed instances of this happening yet. If this did happen, it sure seems like the culprits would have made themselves conspicuous by their repeated claims of payment failures. With some effort on Gox's part, any double payments that did happen should be clear, but discovering them would be unlikely to help Gox recoup any double pay outs.

The way you cherry pick information to try to bolster your twisted viewpoint reflects how you fixate on relatively minor challenges or limitations for Bitcoin and assume that they mean the experiment has failed. For instance, your choice of quotation from the Wikipedia article is buried in the body of text in the midst of technical discussion. It is also contradicted by content that comes just before the quote you chose, such that employing it as you have is in fact using it out of context. By contrast, my quote from the Wikipedia article *is the very first line*.  
That's fine, though, because the more you explain your thought processes, the more obvious your labyrinthine and irrational thinking becomes to anyone willing to wade through your rhetoric.

NOTE: Before you do anything else, backup your wallet.dat file from your Bitcoin Core data directory.  
You could try closing the client and re-launching it from a command line using the -rescan option. If that doesn't fix it, you may need to wipe out your Bitcoin data folder (make sure to backup your wallet.dat first, of course). You might as well make sure you're running the latest Bitcoin Core 0.9.2.1, also:  
  
Then download the latest bootstrap.dat via bittorrent from this link (block height 317000):  
Put the bootstrap.dat in your Bitcoin Core data directory and start the wallet. Once the wallet is synced, close the program and replace the newly created wallet.dat file with a copy of your backed-up wallet.dat. When you start the wallet again, it'll perform a rescan automatically. When that's done you should be back up and running.

I was envisioning something as simple as a person or group that would work at having a trusted reputation in the Bitcoin community and perform this function for a fee. Almost like a public notary, or more accurately, an escrow agent. The key difference, as you mentioned, would be this person or organization never holds the funds in question in any way.
I figure having a way to see feedback from former multisig clients would be important in establishing a reputation in this space.
As far as a way to do an automated fee release if three parties agree, I'm not sure that the current Bitcoin protocol is capable of this, but I hope someone corrects me if I'm wrong. I know most if not all of the Bitcoin 2.0-type initiatives (i.e. Ethereum, Open Transactions, etc.) would be capable of handling that.

It's been a while, and my experience was using Qt on a Windows platform. In that case I would get information by observing the progress bar on the lower left and by hovering over the status icons on the lower right.
If you're using bitcoind by command line, I think you'll have to delve into what the available commands can give you. I'm fairly sure getinfo will give some insight. Not sure what it will look like during the import phase, but during the longer rescan phase, you should see the block number incrementing much faster than if it was getting downloaded over the p2p network. If you see that, you should be good. Just wait for the rescan to catch up to everything that was in your bootstrap.dat. It'll then revert to downloading the most recent blocks via p2p until you're fully synced.
You'll end up having saved a lot of time, but it's still far from instant (many hours, maybe 12 our more spending on your computer's hard drive storage speed).

I presume you think this is a risk because less mining means less network security? If so, how much do you anticipate the hashrate would reduce if we increase block size?

Even presuming what you speculate occurs, I don't see how a small reduction in mining is a serious risk.

That sounds like it's in the ballpark. Perhaps it'll accelerate some as it goes along. I seem to remember the last time I did it, it took over 12 hours, but I don't remember the exact figure. Most of the time is occupied by a re-scan of the blockchain that is automatically done right after the bootstrap.dat content is imported. Overall, it's still significantly faster than just syncing the entire blockchain from scratch. I've seen recent posts stating that can take 3 or more days for the current 17GB blockchain size.

Raising the block limit doesn't mean you'll instantly have full blocks at whatever the new raised limit is. Growth will likely continue much as it has in the past, meaning the cost to run a node would change incrementally, and may even decrease depending on advances in technology. Whether or not there's a sudden surge in adoption is the wild-card, but if this were to happen and cause full blocks and rising transaction fees, I expect development and/or adoption of solutions like the Lightning Network would get spurred. In any case, large scale adoption sounds like a good problem to have.

Pretty much, or track down Peter Todd's tool kit. Never done it or researched how to do it myself. It's not all that easy to do, and is only really successful for zero confirmation transactions, which tend to have small fund values, negating the incentive for an attacker to try. Even when you successfully submit a double-spend attack, it is only succeeds some percentage of the time.  
Double-spending confirmed transactions is entirely different, requiring control of large percentages of Bitcoin's mining hash power. In this case, all the built-in economic incentives make it more profitable to function within the Bitcoin ecosystem instead of attacking it.

Such a costly attack might be a disruption, but it would only end up adding strength and legitimacy to the Bitcoin network. It would literally pump billions of dollars into the Bitcoin economy while demonstrating to the world that an attacker of national scale considers it to be a threat worthy of such a costly attack. Meanwhile, the disruption caused by the attack itself would likely be a transitory inconvenience.

It's not a percentage fee. It depends on transaction size and some other technical details, but not directly related to the amount being transferred. And as always, if you're patient, a transaction sent with no fees almost always goes through eventually.  
As I posted earlier, the largest ever single Bitcoin transaction was $147 million USD worth, sent with *zero* fees. So the example you used of sending $100 USD worth of bitcoin would also typically cost 4 cents or less, resulting in a fee in percentage terms of 0.04% or less for that specific transaction.   
It's true that currently if you try to send quite small amounts, like $1 USD, 4 cents is a significant proportional amount, but keep in mind that this is still much superior to existing methods of sending the same amount (if it's even possible). And the transfer can go around the world, cross borders, is independent of banks and governments, and settlement (if a recommended fee is used) occurs on average within 10 minutes*, whereas sending by many existing methods can take several business days.  
Such small transactions, usually called microtransactions, can be better handled a number of ways using bitcoin as currency, but not usually over the Bitcoin network itself. That's how ChangeTip works, using transactions known as *off-chain* within a traditional company. So within ChangeTip's off-chain framework, sending or receiving a tip of even the smallest amount of bitcoin is free. As a company, though, ChangeTip does plan to earn a profit soon. Starting in January 2015, they will charge 1% of any amount you withdraw from ChangeTip to an on-chain Bitcoin address.  
\*The average 10 minute settlement assumes a single confirmation is enough verification, which would be quite adequate for a microtransaction. If more confirmation is desired, increasing multiples of the 10 minute average settlement time exponentially increases the transaction's security.  
EDIT: Added ChangeTip details.

If fees rise at some point during the attack *relative* to the value of bitcoin at that time, the problem would only remain for a temporary period *and* while the attack continues to occur. Meanwhile, its obvious to the market that if you keep pouring value into Bitcoin to attack Bitcoin, valuation can't always go down, no matter the market psychology. Once value starts to rise (either immediately, or from any low point after a hypothetical crash), it becomes a game of forbearance. Those still using Bitcoin would need to conduct only transactions where the rising fees are still economical, but the continued attack is now raising bitcoin value constantly as well. And with the sure knowledge that the end of the attack would mean some kind of bump in the valuation of bitcoin, I guarantee that there will be those that stick around waiting for either the attack to end, or for a change in Bitcoin that addresses the issue (should the community agree it's necessary).
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:24:48
If you're basing confirmation times on what's needed for near instant brick-and-mortar transactions, you'd need confirmation times on the order of a couple seconds. This is because of the natural variability you get with all block times (i.e. there will always be infrequent block intervals that are 10x to 20x the average block time, but since these definitely do happen, even 5 second average block times are not always fast enough for in-person transactions). Worse, at confirmation times that low, the orphan rate gets untenable, and the security of a single confirmation is very low.  
Basically, reducing block times is not the path to fast/instant transactions. Solutions such as the Lightning Network, or even centralized solutions are far preferable.

While it may be technically correct to say addresses do not hold bitcoin balances, it seems onerously technical to fixate on this point. I find it a useful abstraction to consider the sum total of UTXOs sent to a particular address at a particular point in time that address's balance. Unless you have specific examples why this abstraction is blatantly incorrect or dangerous, I'll choose to continue to use it.  
The risks you point out in having a single EC key receive multiple transactions and during any subsequent sweeping are very real, and should be kept in mind for those that understand Bitcoin quite well and care about the nth degree of security. However, for general security conscious Bitcoin users, the added risk is realistically marginal. Using every EC key to receive and send a single transaction may be the utmost best practice, but IMO is somewhat extreme.

I'm a little confused about some of the information in your image and in your post. First of all, you keep referring to $2,500, which is your maximum weekly purchase quota from Circle. You ask about funding $2,500 and getting 2.872 BTC, but 2.872 BTC only is $1,205.37 at the time of your screenshot (that info is even shown in the "Deposit Summary" area). $2,500 worth of BTC would be more than double the amount in BTC. Also, the bar indicator seems to show you have *already* used up your entire $2,500 weekly buy quota.  
But I'll try to answer your question as best as I understand it. When you buy from Circle, the price for the BTC you get is locked in at the time of purchase. So if you buy $2,500 when all of your weekly quota is available, you'll get BTC at the price when you submitted that purchase, but there'll be no more purchase quota avaiable for you to buy until the next week, so you would *not* be able to purchase at subsequent different BTC prices. On the other hand, if you buy *less* than the quota amount so that some quota remains, then you could use the remaining quota to buy at different prices throughout the week, until your quota refreshes the next week. I'm hoping this answers your question, but if not, please explain where I went wrong and I'll try again.

You may have encountered an uncommon technical problem because the Bitpay implementation at Newegg doesn't wait for confirmations. The processing of the sale continues as soon as the transaction is seen on the network. This is fine for Newegg regardless of the dollar value of the transaction since they do not do real-time brick-and-mortar sales. If confirmations fail to arrive later, they can stop the packaging or will call process any time prior to shipping or delivery (they could easily have a behind the scenes 10 confirmation requirement, but the customer would never know about it).  
I'd contact Newegg *and* Bitpay. It's likely one of the two will be motivated to iron out this problem quickly.

You're confusing new bitcoin issuance with increasing divisibility of bitcoin units. Issuance of new bitcoins halves about every four years and ends about 2140 when very nearly 21 million bitcoins have been mined.  More halvings after that point would mean further new bitcoin production, breaking the core principal of fixed total supply.  
The concept of further unit divisibility is relevant if the price of a single bitcoin rises enough such that the value of the smallest subunit (currently a satoshi or 100 millionth of a bitcoin) is too great to be practical. At that point, bitcoins can be made more divisible via relatively trivial code changes. Think of it not as adding more pizzas, but creating more slices in each existing pizza.

Thank you for your detailed response. As I mentioned, I have not personally used Mycelium, nor am I familiar with the details of how it works, so I apologize if I mischaracterized any of Mycelium's actual functionality. In fact, I have heard good things about it, and I have not yet heard of any incidences of stolen coins directly attributed to the use of Mycelium.  
However, my post was simply meant to clarify that what was mentioned as a Mycelium printed paper backup wallet is not the same as what is commonly discussed as a paper wallet explicitly created for the purpose of cold storage.
You took care in explaining the details inside an Android system that are meant to protect the live stored private key, and those characteristics may or may not function perfectly as a defense right now. There is always the small possibility of a zero day exploit in some part of the system. Such exposure risks would only tend to increase over time as the same private key continues to be used on a live system. The user may also choose to root or otherwise unknowingly weaken security provisions in the system at any future time.  
And that is the distinction I tried to make: the private key of a cold storage paper wallet is never exposed to a live, Internet connected system at any time until it is redeemed. It is thus impossible for it to be attacked by a bad actor in the digital domain.  
This was not meant as an attack on Mycelium or the Android OS. The amount of consideration for security evident in the characteristics Mycelium is impressive, but it is practically impossible for any private key stored in a system that can perform live signed transactions to be equally as safe as a cold storage private key that has had no level of exposure.  
From what I know of Mycelium, I would feel quite confident using it, and I would have faith in its capability to protect moderate Bitcoin balances. But personally, I would not store any large portion of my life savings in *any* live connected system.

If you know and trust the sending party, zero confirmations could be fine. When receiving from an unknown party, though, you should be aware that double-spends are apparently doable (thought I personally haven't figured out how) particularly if fee-gaming is used. In this ploy, the crook sends you an apparently good transaction that is either zero fee, severely under fee, or has very immature coins. One or all of these factors will delay the transaction getting picked up by miners. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to you, the crook has simultaneously double-spent the same coins but with a much larger fee to an address of his/her own. The trick here is being able to submit the second transaction with the proper fee to enough miners' mempools so that there is a good chance the second transaction gets confirmed first, *and at the same time* making sure the first transaction gets in the minimum number of the right nodes' mempools so that the merchant service provider thinks the transaction is OK. The details of how to accomplish this reliably is what I've never figured out yet, myself. When I've played around with it, the second transaction is generally rejected from the network because the first transaction propagates very quickly.  
Peter Todd made [a post some time ago]( claiming the process was simple, repeatable, and succeeded in a high percentage of attempts, though if I recall correctly he glossed over both the fee-gaming *and* any explanation of how to submit the second transaction to the network (perhaps with good reason, not wanting to enable the attack for thieves). There's also the corresponding [BitcoinTalk thread](
There are, of course, ways to protect yourself and still accept zero confirmation transactions with reasonable confidence. The first is to evaluate the transaction the customer sends before delivering goods. Make sure there are no issues that will delay confirmation. This alone almost closes the door on the fee-gaming attack. You can also use a system like Mycelium Android wallet's Buy / Sell [Transaction Confidence]( meter to see how well the correct transaction is propagating over the network. Finally, you should monitor Blockchain.info (and perhaps other block explorers that have the same feature) for double-spends of the inputs of the original transaction. IMPORTANT NOTE: Blockchain.info flags double-spends, but apparently this flag on the transaction disappears in a couple days or so.  
Even if you take the above defensive precautions, I'm not sure accepting a zero confirmation transaction nearing $1k is a good idea.
@_date: 2015-05-03 22:37:27
Thanks for the input. While I can see your perspective, I still think the WeUseCoins videos (original and even the updated one) are the shortest and most direct on-ramp videos to capture initial interest. Although it's true that Bitcoin is truly a ledger, and that the concept of digital tokens is a further abstraction, many may not yet have realized that all currencies are truly just ledger systems. For these uninitiated, relating Bitcoin to something physical that they are comfortable using and exchanging (cash) may still be a more accessible approach. Like it or not, the model is inherent in the cryptocurrency's name  Bit**coin**.
Personally, I haven't yet encountered particularly serious confusion from these competing explanations, but I do try to mention that Bitcoin's many characteristics can be thought of in a variety of ways. Perhaps I'll try to touch on the differences in approach the next time I make the suggestions.

Coinbase merchant service transactions require a fee, even though they make no mention of it. If your customer's transactions really took 6 hours to confirm (for only the first confirmation?), that seems to indicate he paid with inadequate or no fee, immature coins, and/or the transaction relied on unconfirmed inputs. My thinking is that a properly designed merchant service platform should warn for any of these issues once they are seen. At the same time, a proper wallet should also notify the paying customer about these issues before sending a transaction, and if possible, compensate with an appropriate fee.  
I've used Bitpay's merchant service interface several times to buy from Newegg and never had a problem. Those transactions were nearly instant and did not require a wait for a confirmation, but Newegg has plenty of time to cancel an order if a double-spend or other problem arises while they are preparing to ship. I've used Coinbase's merchant service platform to buy from eGifter a couple of times and that's when I discovered their problem accepting high-priority zero-fee transactions. A subsequent off-chain try with an amount from a Coinbase wallet had no problems (I have not tried again with a non-Coinbase wallet when including a fee).
If you're a brick-and-mortar merchant and need to deliver goods immediately, a direct zero-confirmation transaction for $1k+ would make me nervous (this shouldn't apply to you as you are using Coinbase). If your customer's payment was without any of the above mentioned issues, *and* if Coinbase's platform worked as advertised, the transaction should have completed nearly instantly. Purportedly, Coinbase's terms and conditions make them responsible for double-spends (though I don't know if any claims have been made and reimbursed by them in this regard), so a zero-confirmation transaction via Coinbase may be acceptable. On the other hand, my understanding is that BitPay does not cover double-spend risk, so accepting a large, in-person, zero-confirmation transaction using their merchant service platform would not be advisable.  
As for how common such issues are with Coinbase, I couldn't say. I'd recommend discussing it with their support (and perhaps getting escalated to speaking with a supervisor, the initial support reps aren't always completely up to speed on Bitcoin minutiae). I hope they can provide you with significantly smoother service going forward.

If you choose to export then import your private key to Electrum, use care because the process is susceptible to loss if you make a mistake. Once you've imported the key into Electrum, I'd suggest sending the funds to one of your own Electrum generated addresses. Otherwise, you'll need to backup the imported private key separately from the Electrum seed.

Compare the *scale* of wars before and after the advent of fiat. Prior to fiat, wars were often decided and confined by economic constraints. Since fiat, it definitely seems that elastic money supply permits the scale of war to increase by orders of magnitude.

In most places, mining can end up costing more than you'd get back in bitcoin, but in Kosovo (depending on your electricity rates), it might be an economical or even profitable way to get bitcoin compared to your other meager options. If you go this route, only buy from a reputable seller that has the miners on hand. I'd never advise a pre-order buy.

You'll probably just need to be patient. Any double-spend attempt with an appropriate miners' fee would need to wait until the first transaction disappears from enough miners' mempools. I've heard this can take as much as three days. I'm pretty sure your original transaction will confirm by then.  
For future reference, any transaction with a $1 miners' fee is just overkill. Typical fees are around 0.0001 BTC at most (that's currently around USD $0.02; depending on transaction size, multiples of this may be required). If you use a wallet like Bitcoin Core that offers Coin Control, you can carefully select your inputs and control the transaction size to send zero fee transactions that confirm pretty quickly (sometimes in a few block, generally in less than a few hours).

If there was leakage due to incompetence, repeated withdrawals of the same amount should be evident in the blockchain. Someone will eventually dig these out if they exist. Then you should be able to add them all up and see roughly the total amount due to leakage and incompetence. I bet that amount still won't add up to the (still uncomfirmed) ~750,000 bitcoins. The difference would be the amount stolen/embezzled by Karpeles and/or other MtGox staff.

I suppose I am making some assumptions when I contend that non-mining nodes are influential in the event of a fork. I assume that there are far more non-mining nodes than mining nodes that contribute a significant amount of hashing power. I also assume that nearly all responsible for maintaining non-mining nodes hold some amount of bitcoin.  
If my assumptions are true, it's clear that if all miners want one thing, but all those responsible for non-mining nodes want something else, all the miners will be mining on one chain that would likely have almost no bitcoin that would be transacted on it, nor much of a network to receive and transmit new transactions. Meanwhile those that run non-mining nodes but who in aggregate hold a significant amount of bitcoin will wish to transact on another chain. This chain would momentarily be starved for hashing power, perhaps severely restricting it until the next difficulty adjustment (worst-case, a hard fork could be needed here to jump start the network), but new miners would quickly step in as this chain would be where the most value is. *This* is why non-mining nodes (not even just full nodes) have power in the case of a fork.

Even "free" banking services are not really free. If your money is in a bank account, they do fractional reserve banking with it. This makes them profits at risk to your money (yes it may be insured, but this is paid for elsewhere, again by you and others). On average, the services they offer customers will never cost them more than the profit they are making with your money. So your free services have an opportunity cost, and the bank is taking its percentage there.

Regarding whether it's a good time to buy, and what the price will do--no one can say with any real certainty. The best policy would be to try to absorb as much information as possible and use your own best judgement and instinct.
Keep in mind that investing in bitcoin is enormously risky. Truly do not risk more than you can afford to lose. That said, risky investments have the higher risk of going to zero while they can also have the higher chance of having large returns.
Study Bitcoin, see if you feel it has any use or potential. If so, that may help you justify some of the investment risk to yourself, particularly if you're investing for a long time horizon.
In terms of trading quickly, you cannot really do this on Coinbase which is really a brokerage rather than an exchange. There are no real exchanges based in the U.S. that have significant volume and liquidity. Currently the two most credible exchanges are Bitstamp (operating out of Slovenia with a company presence in the U.K.) and BTC-e (speculation is that they are based in Bulgaria, but no one seems to know for sure). Bitstamp is more solid, but requires verification. BTC-e is in some ways quite sketchy, but they do not require verification and have been around for a good while. You can do the fastest trading if you use a trading program that interacts with your exchange through its API. I haven't done any programmed trading myself, so you'll have to research further if this is your plan.
Fast trading like this is also known as day trading, and can be a quick way to lose vast fortunes. If you're intent on trying it, keep a level head and apply common sense. I'd strongly suggest starting with small sums.

It sounds like you believe that any time someone messes with Bitcoin's code the result is a hard fork. The reality is it doesn't matter how much the code is fiddled with if no significant number of miners/users adopts the code changes. True hard forks only occur when code changes are adopted by wide consensus, and as such tend to be relatively rare.

How do you get 10% + $0.15 for Coinbase? I just checked a little while ago. I would've paid about 0.3-0.5% spread as compared to the Bitstamp price at the time, plus 1% fee and the $0.15. That's nowhere near 10%. Of course, the Coinbase buy price changes, so there may be times when the spread is larger, but I'd be surprised if it averaged anywhere near 10%.  
If you're in the U.S., they've still got to be one of the cheapest options, especially for small amounts. If you're making a large purchase, then the cost of bank wires may not be significant and purchasing at an exchange like Bitstamp or Bitfinex could be cheaper.  
You can review some general buy options here:  
  
There aren't a lot of credit card options, and none are cheap. Any time you pay with a reversible payment method, the seller is assuming an enormous risk. +already mentioned Virwox. Some sellers on LocalBitcoins may take credit. And there's the two indirect methods:

The system is self-adjusting. If it's heavily used at that point, that would imply the value of each bitcoin is high, transaction volume is high, and block rewards based only on transaction fees will be worth a significant sum. As a result, a significant global hashrate would likely be profitable. If Bitcoin use fades, total block reward will be small, miners will unplug, difficulty will drop and Bitcoin will continue with lower transaction volume, with less security, but it will always be profitable to mine for some segment of the population.

Since your post was fairly popular, it seems your Reddit username may have attracted the notice of scammers. Bitcoin the protocol itself has proven to be quite secure over its short life, but incidents of digital theft and social engineering scams are far too common. Don't involve yourself with anything that even seems the least bit shady. You can always post here to ask about the legitimacy of any Bitcoin-related service in particular if you are at all unsure. [The BitcoinTalk Forum]( is another useful resource.  
Overall, I think Bitcoin has a great and growing community around it, but it has also somehow attracted a none-too-small group of pathologically rabid trolls (check if you'd like to be amazed). Not all that criticize Bitcoin are trolls, and some have legitimate and constructive input, but legit critics can get mistakenly bunched in with the trolls as some of the latter are incredibly vocal and persistent. There are those that insist there is institutional or state sponsored sock puppetry going on, but I'm personally on the fence about that contention.  
That said, if you come across any criticism of Bitcoin that concerns you, please raise it here as it's only by confronting potential weaknesses that Bitcoin can improve and become stronger. For Bitcoin, these are really still early days, and it's often been likened to the Wild West. Be sensible, research when possible, and be stingy with your trust.

The hierarchy you are referring to is simply an organizational scheme the developers themselves have chosen to implement to try to make progress on Bitcoin code more efficient. The decentralization of open source development reveals itself by the fact that no one is *required* to follow the work of any particular individual or group. Anyone can modify existing code or even write their own code that builds on the Bitcoin protocol. They can then release it publicly and try to get a consensus of Bitcoin users to join by using that code. Such an effort wouldn't need Gavin's, or Satoshi's, or anyone else's permission, nor could anyone prevent such an effort.

I think I understand what you're saying. You've used Ripple to trade assets in Ripple that are denominated in one fiat for another fiat denomination, but the result is still within Ripple, right? But if you want to get fiat cash in hand after the exchange, or failing that, at least have a balance in a traditional bank that you can access normally (say, by ATM or debit card, etc.) my understanding is that you *must* use a gateway. Please educate me if I'm wrong.


There are many projects now that are seeking to do truly decentralized currency exchange. Excluding fiat part of the process, it seems that block chain-based cryptos can in general serve as the basis for these decentralized, crypto-only exchanges. Getting fiat into and out of such a system in a decentralized way, however, is not a solved problem AFAIK.  


I think that's the crux of the matter. If your network requires trust at different levels for different parts of the network, it's just not as decentralized as a network where all the members are equal. For a decentralized exchanged to be fully free of the breaches of the trust repeatedly experienced in conventional, centralized exchanges it must strive to exclude required trust as much as possible.
@_date: 2014-12-12 19:22:27
When speaking of trust in a transaction, you generally don't also consider *trusting yourself*. Someone using Bitcoin can make a mistake, but this says nothing about whether Bitcoin requires trust. Also, you can't easily garble a Bitcoin address and end up sending to a dead address due to the built-in checksum. If a mistake occurs it's much more common that a wrong, previously used address is substituted. In such cases, it's not unusual for a little record checking to result in finding the previous recipient and getting funds returned after contact is established.
Many people pay credit card fees, but far fewer ever reap such protection benefits. Bitcoin offers innovative and lower cost ways to solve the same issues, *and* all of these solutions can be implemented *by choice*, instead of being broadly imposed as a fee upon almost all online transactions.

At least (there have been smaller ones that you could count also). And each time this has happened in the past, it's been a spike rather than a bubble.

Truly excellent, thanks for doing this. And yet there are some factors you left out that would push the numbers even more strongly in favor of Bitcoin. The excess physical resources the existing financial system requires when compared to Bitcoin mining, and the energy costs and resources therein. The cost of the infrastructure and energy to deal with credit and debit card fraud in the legal system. To deal with Identity Theft. The energy and resources used in marketing and advertising, staff healthcare and HR. There's probably a lot more, but those are the ones off the top of my head.

Thanks, but again is this doesn't strike me as much of a benefit for anonymity. Even if it's not the same coins, anyone attempting to track connections can see funds go in, and with legal justification (or potentially via hack, or leak, etc.) could get access to records that show where the funds then go. Routing your bitcoins this way seems like it would just leave an evidence trail around for an indeterminate amount of time, and with unknown security.  
Tumblers and some exchanges (altcoin or otherwise, such as BTC-e) might have more incentive to hide themselves and possibly not keep logs, but Bitcoin companies that apparently "play nice" in the jurisdictions they reside in would not be my first choice for enhancing anonymity.
@_date: 2014-10-11 03:17:47
Well, then I'd ask what your motivation mainly is: 1) Profit, 2) Support the Bitcoin network, 3) Support an altcoin or crypto-currencies in general, and/or 4) Learn about microelectronics.  
If primarily 1), there's pretty much a way you can be guaranteed of profit right now assuming you do have free power from a water turbine. You basically want to *avoid* spending anything on additional hardware, because there's a very good chance you'll never earn your expenses back. I think the best way to do this is still to go the scrypt route and mine through CleverMining. You might want to check my estimate on this, as the price of altcoins relative to Bitcoin has dropped a lot since I was doing this six months or more ago. Another factor is scrypt ASICs are now entering the scene raising the difficulty quickly as they did with Bitcoin's SHA256 algorithm. Check to see what old and/or idle computers and, most importantly, what newer generation AMD/ATI video cards you have lying around. Nvidia video cards work as well, but are not as efficient. Using your free power, set them all up doing combination CPU and GPU mining of scrypt to CleverMining. This will almost certainly generate some tiny income, and you will not have spent anything on additional hardware. Keep in mind that most stock computers cannot tolerate this heat/power supply load for long, so you may need to open the cases and set up external fans. If you live in a warm climate, the only added cost to you may be higher A/C use. If you live in a cold area, you're getting free heat!  
If 2), you'd need to recognize this will be a hobby that will most likely *cost* you money rather than earn it. However, the costs can be very small, at least initially. To support the Bitcoin network, you must mine the SHA256 algorithm on the Bitcoin block chain. You can also *try* CPU and GPU mining SHA256, but I strongly suspect you might accumulate Bitcoin dust too slowly to ever reach a mining pool's payout limit. The ASIC you linked in your OP from Amazon *would* work for this purpose, but the Block Erupter is an early generation ASIC that is not efficient by modern standards. I'd also recommend you check for any hardware you want to buy on eBay also, as used Block Erupters are going for about $5 USD right now. If you want to spend the $1,000+ on current hardware, you'll want the most efficient, modern ASIC you can be *sure* to get your hands on. Beware that most ASIC companies are dodgy and you should assume they will scam you rather than deliver on time. Bitmain is probably the most reputable manufacturer right now, and even here it's best to avoid pre-orders and purchase stock-on-hand. Used Bitmain Antminer S3's are going for between $250 and $320 USD on eBay right now. S4's are between $1,350 and $2,000 USD. These generally require one or more separate, high-power ATX power supplies which are often $100+ each.  
If 3), again, this will likely be a hobby that costs money. You'd need to acquire hardware that most efficiently mines the algorithm of the crypto-currency you're looking to support. Some of these do not have ASICs yet. For these, one or more AMD Radeon R9 290x video cards are probably the best bet. Otherwise, if you choose to mine a scrypt-based altcoin, there are already ASICs, but I don't know what the most efficent and cost effective currently are. I know [Grid Seed]( has several, some of which you can buy from retailers that have stock on hand. Grid Seeds may require non-PC power supplies. Again, eBay is another source.  
If 4), you'll probably want to minimize your expenses. Again this is unlikely to make a profit. I'd start with the best low-cost to high mining efficiency ratio you can get. The Block Erupters are low cost, but not very efficient. On the other side is the USB Bitfury Hex-Fury at 11 GH/s. These are quite expensive, and I haven't seen any available on eBay at all, but they may be the most efficient USB ASIC avaialble. If you can get a good buy on some USB Bifury Red Fury's, this might be a reasonable compromise. You could set any of these up in a powered USB hub connected to a rPi and have some fun. Keep in mind, you don't *need* microcomputers like rPi's to drive mining rigs, general PCs work fine. Large mining operations try to minimize costs over dozens or hundreds of rigs, so rPi's or the equivalent make more sense for them. For hobbyist miners, idle desktops or laptops do fine unless you already have rPi's or the equivalent. And if scrypt mining, full computers can contribute a bit via CPU mining whereas microcomputers typically can't contribute hashing power.  
To get started in general, I'd make use of the [BitcoinTalk forums]( They generally list all the announce pages of crypto-currencies, as well as a lot of mining resources. Some keywords that you can search for to get you started include "cpuminer", "cgminer", "cudaminer", "rpc miner", and "cgwatcher". The included documentation text files and READMEs are very helpful.  
EDIT: Forgot to mention that the Block Erupter manufacturer, ASICMiner, is also considered fairly reputable. I'd still recommend avoiding pre-orders if possible.

It depends on what you mean by "verify it works". If you'll only accept a completed sent transaction as verification, that does reduce a cold paper wallet's total security by publishing its public key and address (if done from a secure system, the paper wallet can then still be considered secure if not perfectly cold). However, all you really need to do to check that a private key matches an address is to use a validated, offline copy of [Bitaddress.org]( Just use the "Wallet Details" tab. This is best done from an offline, secure system that will never subsequently go online later. Booting a Linux Live CD offline is a good way to accomplish this.

Unless something tremendously catastrophic occurs to drop the value of a bitcoin to basically nothing, there will always be some miners. If those that are currently mining drop out, difficulty automatically adjusts downward to make it easier to find blocks for remaining miners. At some point this automatic downward adjustment will make it economically profitable for some miners to continue even in the event of vast declines of bitcoin's value.  
The foregoing ignores those that would continue to mine just to support or study Bitcoin in spite of any nominal costs that may be incurred.

If no major changes are made to the mining reward aspect of Bitcoin in the meantime, exactly what will happen circa 2140 when only transaction fees remain to incentivize miners is subject to speculation. The only thing we know for sure is that some equilibrium would be reached. Will the value of bitcoin have soared so much that the transaction fees alone are still a windfall for miners? Or will mining power drop tremendously, leaving a much less secure network along with low difficulty that makes it very easy to mine? It's really anyone's guess, and you may be right that consensus could arise to tweak things to some extent along the way. However, I'm not personally convinced that a majority of Bitcoin mining power could be convinced to adopt major changes to the issuance of new coins simply because nearly all such actions would make bitcoin immediately and sharply less valuable.

FDIC insurance is paid for by premiums which are eventually paid by banks' depositors and customers. TARP was not funded insurance at all.  


IANAL or a prosecutor so its possible that you're correct. If you are, though, it's an abomination. It certainly seems fraudulent to bundle up risky derivatives and pass them off as much safer than they actually are, to mention just one specific and repeated practice. Do you really think it's OK that not a single individual was found guilty of anything in the aftermath of the entire crisis?  


I try to for all the good it does, but I appreciate that Bitcoin represents a possible out from a clearly broken system.  


I'm glad your investments worked out so far, but I'd have at least a little concern that some or all of the returns on your investments are inflated valuations that have trickled down from the insane amount of QE and other central bank manipulation occurring around the world. Perhaps there will never be a reckoning, in which case there's nothing to be concerned about, but it sure feels to me like a balloon continually being filled with air.  


I would never deny that Bitcoin at present is ridiculously volatile. If you play it right, you can make tremendous profits from it, or you could easily lose your shirt. It's a youthful currency still undergoing money supply bootstrapping and early price discovery, but that doesn't make it any sort of scam that benefits a particular minority or centralized party.

You mean a small change in the reward? Possibly, but then a small change wouldn't change the economics for miners much, either. Your original question seems to suggest that the issuance of new bitcoins could be made to continue longer or indefinitely, such as is the case with Dogecoin. I think this would be a major change and would trigger a strong price reaction.  
A less secure network would imply a less useful Bitcoin, which should equate to a lower market cap and price. Part of the uncertainty resolves around how much mining is really needed. Right now it's being fed by this early bootstrap issuance of 25 new coins every 10 minutes. How will things settle as the new coin incentive continues to decline? My crystal ball is murky. But I don't see how miners pulling levers in Bitcoin's protocol will bring them assuredly more profit. The rigidly determined coin supply is a fundamental element of Bitcoin. *Any* changes to it that seem likely to come to pass ought to trigger nervous reactions in the market.

Every participant bailed out in the last financial crisis received a form of free insurance that effectively reversed the effect of taking extremely risky bets with other people's money. Responsible individuals were also completely immunized from legal consequences for their criminal actions. This effectively removes any punitive disincentive that should be the result of failed risky investments in a fair market. This sort of system gaming serves to accelerate the massive wealth inequality that is obvious in the world by providing rich individuals and organizations ways to gamble for more wealth at no risk or expense in the event of losing bets.

If that's what the original poster meant, I'm skeptical that it's much of a boon to anonymity. Most centralized companies are easily subpoenaed or otherwise compromised for records, perhaps nowhere more so than when they're located in the US. ChangeTip in particular does most of its transactions by leaving trails in various social media channels. There's also no way for an outsider to know exactly how long records are kept or how well they'll be secured. I doubt such options would be that appealing to those seeking strong anonymity.

Why are you being an apologist for those responsible for the crisis escaping virtually unscathed? What I'd prefer is for regulators in the government to do their jobs and punish parties complicit in the crisis. Bail-out funds could have been used to directly benefit anyone affected by your hypothetical great depression, if it actually happened. Or even better, effort could have been made to clean out the upper management of any banks and financial companies found to be the worst contributors to the crisis, only providing TARP funds when vetted temporary replacements were selected. If you're going to try to cushion the effects of a financial disaster, you must make sure responsible parties still feel the pain or history is guaranteed to repeat itself sooner rather than later.  
Reading the rest of your post, I truly pity your thought processes.

I did a little calculation for a recent comment I posted:  


So assuming it continues at this average rate for the next ten years (something that it has badly missed for the last 15 or 16 months), and starting with the current value of $241.35 per BTC, I get that each BTC would be worth $2,192,667,939,039.02 (~$2.19 trillion) in 10 years time(!!)  
Somehow, I suspect growth will continue to gradually slow, and the actual exchange value in 10 years will be substantially less.  
Repeating this math using the most conservative data points from [this two-year moving average Blockchain.info chart]( I get a much smaller annual growth of 100.699%. Using that rate, in 10 years one BTC would be worth $253,563.16.
Neither of these estimates accounts for growth that continually slows during the 10 year period, so the real answer is likely a lot less. And don't forget that Bitcoin is really just a grand experiment that is still in beta. It's unlikely that anyone can imagine all the risks in the next 10 years which might cause the value to drop, or even cause Bitcoin to implode completely.

I've done the smallest bit of dabbling in Wikipedia editing, and I've lurked in some of their Talk pages. I've learned that they strive to make sure information in articles is "reliably sourced". This means that speculation about how Bitcoin might be used will likely be drummed out of an article quickly as lacking source or being "Original Research". And as the other side of the same coin, mainstream media's predilection to label Bitcoin as a Ponzi or scam means there's plenty of arguably "reliable" source material to justify the inclusion of the Ponzi section. Of course, all of Wikipedia's rules quickly result in lots of political "Wikilawyering". If you think the back and forth in this subreddit is contentious, check out the Talk pages in the more controversial Wikipedia articles. I wouldn't be surprised if the Bitcoin article qualifies as one of these.

Only the block chain with the most expended work is the real or official chain. A double-spend is just an attempt extract multiples of value from a single set of coins. The block chain never knows which transaction in a double-spend attempt is the "real" or "legitimate" transaction, but whichever one gets mined into the block chain with the most work (and continues to get blocks mined on top of it) becomes the only official transaction with those coins. No other chain needs to be "invalidated" because no other chain has the most expended work.

You've already said this does not kill Bitcoin. So what happens *after* the worst disruption you envision this causes? Does the attacker continue? If so, you're in that positive feedback loop from then on. If they stop, Bitcoin is back to being undisrupted, markets return to normal *plus* whatever value was added during the attack.  
And I'll just repeat, my thinking is since everyone can realize this, any potential disruption will be at least somewhat mitigated because the end game is known.

If you're going to wade in as an editor, just be aware that detractors likely have more ammunition to cite from, particularly since academic work on Bitcoin is really now just starting to get off the ground. I bet Wikipedia editors could even dispute the "reliability" of Satoshi's white paper, since it was never officially published in any journal *and* since it's written under a pseudonym.

Your original comment claims Purse is "mostly for thieves and carders". In your own first link, OP was made whole by Purse on a transaction that went bad. Even the OP of that thread does not know for a fact that credit card fraud or theft was involved. Your second link represented a major PR issue for Purse, for which they subsequently responded with this policy:  
  
In that thread, Purse claims that of over 10,000 transactions, less than 0.04% went awry. Of those that did, fraud was not always the cause. Elsewhere in the same thread, comments dispute Purse's claims to some extent, but still fail to source anything to media reports, or even better, complaint resolution services or police reports.  
Personally, I've noted several threads here with complaints about Purse's service which may or may not include these two you've posted. That's enough for me that I won't be trying them, even with their new $10,000 Spender Guarantee. Still, I think we can all agree they've very likely done significantly more than, say, ~20 total transactions since they've been in business. If the Purse's service is "mostly for thieves and carders", the few anonymous Internet reports I've read hardly bears that out. They should at least be getting destroyed on their [Twitter handle](  but I'm not seeing it.
It looks like you and your friends in are really paying attention, so I'll ask again, do you have any actual *proof* or *source material* that contests Purse's claims?

As to why, I have no idea. But I can observe that over the course of its history, Bitcoin has grown in spurts. After each spurt there has been a decline of some percentage of the last spurt. Then the valuation has basically gone sideways for periods of as much as months.

If you're in the green, of course it's "worth it" to cash out now. Just keep in mind, that assessment is only accurate right this minute. I've seen many posts in relating how they purchased bitcoin back in the day, sold some time later for x profit (sometimes quite a substantial amount of profit *at that time*), and are now tremendously regretting it.  
Ask yourself this: how much do you understand Bitcoin? From what you know of it, do you think people in general will find value in it in the future? If you don't cash out now, when will you need your investment back? If your time horizon is short, perhaps cashing out some or all now is the right decision for you. If you believe in Bitcoin and will not *need* these funds for say a year or more, you may want to consider holding.  
And, as other posters in this thread have already added, you could sell some percentage and continue to hold some amount as well.  
On the other hand, if holding any amount of Bitcoin keeps you distractingly focused on watching tickers all day, then that might be an incentive to sell earlier. Good luck in any case.

Among the hundreds of altcoins, I'd guess that it's happened at least a few times.

Still nothing about Brawker?  
Now, both Amazon and credit card companies may be hushing up losses and just reimbursing most victims (with the notable exception of Amazon gift card customers), but that makes them complicit in facilitating this sort of fraud.

All I can say is that I've personally witnessed the fee-gaming variety of zero confirmation double spend. But even in the cases where I've witnessed it, I can't confirm that it defrauded a vendor or the intended recipient, or that it was able to defeat a merchant service provider like BitPay or Coinbase. Personally I don't have that much visibility into the matter, and companies in the space do not seem to like to publicly discuss the issue.  
On Blockchain.info, a double-spend is flagged and both transactions are viewable for up to a couple of days after the incident. After that, it seems the unconfirmed transaction eventually gets dropped from searchable records along with the double-spend flag.  
One confirmation is much better than no confirmations, but for very large amounts, I'd wait for several more.

See, this why you believe sane people can't understand your ranting. They generally have trouble with people claiming "day is night" or "light is dark". The fact of the matter is, words and phrases have generally accepted definitions. According to [Wikipedia](  


Per the [American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language]( "fiat" means:  


1. An arbitrary order or decree.
2. Authorization or sanction: government fiat.  
You'll note that neither of these apply *at all* to Bitcoin.  
You then go further off the deep end by attributing my challenge of your incorrect use of basic definitions to attitudes towards fiat that you alone attribute to me:  


Even if any of this tripe were remotely true, it has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that you can't seem to have discourse in common terms.
You may disagree with how the world understands fiat money and fiat, and that's fine, but you can't arbitrarily use words to mean something other than what nearly everyone else assumes, and then expect to be understood.  
With regards to educators, I admire those that go against the grain and think outside the box. However, it's incumbent on such iconoclasts to clearly specify the terms of their discussion. If you would just say, "Most people think fiat is 'A', but I think it's really 'B'", and proceed from there I'd take no issue. You instead redefine terms arbitrarily for everyone else and then marvel when they take issue with what you say.  
You also seem to be patently unable to admit a mistake or error.

If profitability declines--due for instance to decreasing block rewards, reduced value of bitcoin and/or the increased cost of energy--fewer computing resources will be dedicated to mining and consequently the difficulty will fall.

OK, inception was January 3, 2009. First published exchange rate was $1 = 1,309.03 BTC (~$0.0007639 per BTC) on October 5, 2009. Current exchange rate ~$229.15 per BTC. I get an increase in value over the intervening ~5.5 years of ~29,996,322.4% (roughly 30 million %). Since inception, the growth is likely much, much greater, but I can't find any records of exactly how small the exchange rate was before October 5, 2009. This yields an average growth per year of ~890.445 % (compounded annually). All other currencies have performed better? Citation please?

If you're in the US it's important to keep in mind that the best generally available options right now, [Coinbase]( and [Celery]( are quite different from flaky, fly-by-night exchanges like Mt.Gox. Both Coinbase and Celery are US-based bitcoin sellers, required to meet all attendant rules and regulations, but also subject to US criminal and civil legal remedies.  
Coinbase is a privately owned start-up backed by some $31 million in venture capital, including funds from [Andreessen Horowitz]( the VC firm co-founded by [Marc Andreessen](  
Celery is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NASDAQ-listed WPCS.  
None of this is proof that these companies are infallible, but I felt much better about giving them my banking information as opposed to any foreign-based exchanges.  
The only downside is both Coinbase and Celery are required to conform to US AML/KYC regulations which can make their verification processes and terms of service somewhat onerous.  
[Circle]( also fits this mold, but they are currently invite-only.

Let me try to explain this way: such an attack disrupts Bitcoin when the attacker starts to Spam the network, right? But if they want the network to stay disrupted, they have to continue to attack. So they do, but eventually transaction fees rise. Now the attacker needs more bitcoin to pay the higher fees, so they buy more bitcoin and continue to attack. They've essentially signed themselves up for a positive feedback loop.  
Can this continue forever? Whenever the attacker decides to stop or simply can't afford to continue, what happens to Bitcoin? It's no longer disrupted, but it has all the added value the attacker contributed. Markets can figure this out, and will behave accordingly.

I don't think there's any reason to assume Bitcoin-XT will ever become dominant. Miners need non-mining nodes as much as non-mining nodes need miners.

I prefer not to delve into the motives of fee-paying transactions, but rather to strive for a more robust network. Having more block headroom improves robustness simply by making disruption attempts (if that's even what they are) less effective.

The question is *why* are they pushing complex and as yet unready code *to the exclusion of simply lifting the temporary limit*, which is something that could be done immediately (or really as much as 18 months ago)? Lifting the block size limit would not negatively affect other work on SegWit, LN or anything else in the slightest, it would allow Bitcoin to grow organically while other development continues to progress, and it would alleviate all the attendant negatives currently driving users to alternative block chains.  
When Satoshi implemented the 1 MB block size limit, it was between 50x and 100x as large as the average block size at the time. Since then, Bitcoin has worked fine for years with the large amount of block size headroom. Today, a raise of the limit to 2 MB, 8 MB, or even 20 MB would put the it at much less than 30x the current average block size, and thus be much more conservative than SN's original implementation. If it was OK then, why is it suddenly not OK to act in a *more conservative way* now?

Without question, there is a baseline level of such inquiries at all times. Also, there are definitely some inquiries about "stuck transactions" which seem politically motivated. Regardless, it seems clear to me that there are increasing episodes wherein these posts are occurring at higher than normal rates. These episodes also coincide with periods of heightened transaction fees, another negative for user experience. Transaction fee spikes are clearly recorded by a number of monitoring sites, so this cannot be denied.  


Note the illogical use of "artificial" above. There are damn good reasons for limiting blocksize, else it would have been increased years ago. Sounds like someone has been hanging out on /btc a bit much? Probably better to go back.
People here, actual bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, actually know what's up.  
It's hardly just theory, but common sense backed with substantial anecdotal reporting. During the surge in Bitcoin VC investment from late 2014 through mid-2015, a large number of major financial companies studied Bitcoin extensively (some coverage of this [here]( [here]( and [here]( However, the outcome from this corporate interest was very little, aside from an increasing "block chain without Bitcoin" narrative. The role played by Bitcoin's stifled transaction capability in this got summed up by [Jeff Garzik in his Scaling Bitcoin presentation as seen in this thread]( where he dubs the issue the "Fidelity Problem". More recently, [Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne explicitly mentions Bitcoin's limited throughput as a reason for considering other block chain solutions]( To assume this consideration has no effect on slowing corporate adoption of Bitcoin, nor on driving adoption to alternatives is utterly naive.  
The "damn good reasons" for limiting block size have from day one been purely theoretical. Market forces as well as individual miner self-interest would ultimately limit block sizes even lacking any hard coded limit. The hypothetical attack that large miners could employ against smaller miners entails many real counterattack vectors which would expose the attacker to huge losses. However, from an abundance of caution, a conservative block size limit can be employed that eliminates any meager possibility of such risk without smothering the overall networks usefulness, and *while* alternative scaling solutions are being developed. Bitcoin's history to date, as well as the continued operation of other block chains which have huge headroom between their average block sizes and their block size limits (e.g. Litecoin's current average block size relative to its effective 4 MB block size limit) bears this out.  
e: meant MB not MiB, fixed

It really depends on how many $100,000's you have to invest in cutting edge mining ASICs. If you have at least a few, it becomes a lot more realistic. If you have no ASICs at all, you are truly in lightning strike territory.  
Some quick math: say you have one USB Block Erupter ASIC with ~335 MHash/s (as low as $10-$15 on eBay--prices have gone up, they must be becoming collector's items). Current total current hash rate is 1,543,547,985 GHash/s. So every average block (about every ten minutes) you'd have 1 in 4,607,605,925 chance of finding the block. If you mined for a full year, you'd have 1 in 87,663 chance (as long as difficulty does not increase the whole time, which has never happened). And that's if you have an (old) ASIC. If you've only got a modern CPU or GPU, chances are worse. And don't forget, while you're trying, you're paying for electricity the whole time.

Technically, yes, but the point is the amount of new bitcoin being issued is decreasing on its set schedule. When Bitcoin launched in 2009 there were no bitcoins in existence, so the system is designed to issue new coins to miners on a set schedule: a reward every 10 minutes, with the reward amount halving every 210,000 blocks (roughly every four years). The initial block reward in 2009 was 50 bitcoins. This halved to 25 bitcoins in 2013, and is predicted to halve to 12.5 bitcoins this July.

Long term, money supply is the definitive driver of inflation. This is clear from how every fiat currency steadily loses value as its money supply is increased decade by decade. More short term, though, this slow effect is often swamped by other factors.  
I'm not sure anyone can be certain inflation won't happen until years from now either. Dramatic economic changes can happen in far shorter time scales.  
The immediate inflation for a Chinese citizen right now would be if they try to purchase something directly from an international source, as that is directly where the PBoC's currency changes take direct effect. Moreover, if they want to purchase foreign assets, such as land or property, the inflation affects them right now as well. As you wrote, imported goods available in the domestic market may not see the effect today, but should get increased prices fairly quickly. Broader domestic prices, for China-sourced goods in particular, may stay unaffected for significantly longer. As the world's current largest energy importer, all of China will feel increased energy costs.  
Tight artificial peg or not, the fact is this is a sudden and dramatic change. Other international players will respond to it as such. Also, if you believe the CNBC article, the PBoC's target will be a devaluation of between 5% and 10%, so they're not done yet. Personally, I'd be surprised if there aren't some international ripples from China's action.

I'm not one to contend all developments upon block chains must be upon the Bitcoin block chain. But I am not convinced that there is any clear benefit to building on a *permissioned* block chain. I disagree that the article you linked makes a clear explanation. Many claims in early paragraphs do seem to apply to permissionless block chains, but the article then transitions into claims that permissioned block chains *may* be able to accomplish the same things without ever explaining exactly how this can be accomplished. In fact, the author seems to acknowledge this contradiction:  


If you can find or provide a lucid explanation of how a permissioned block chain can be trusted by all participants as it:  


(a claim attributed by your linked article to Byrne), I'd love to see it. The article then mentions such a block chain is "verifiable, indisputable", but again does not explain how all users of a permissioned ledger can trust such claims.  
On a permissioned block chain, all users, some that may have different levels of access than others, must agree that records in the ledger are indisputable and verifiable. This can only happen if all participants trust those that have the ability to add blocks or fork the chain. If that is the starting point, then why not just give the agreed upon participants write and/or edit ability in a commonly accessible database? The problem is, history has shown that independent business and government entities *do not trust each other in this way*.  
To me it seems self-evident that a permissionless block chain can accomplish these ends, as all users could independently verify the ledger without needing to trust *any* of the other participants. Any permissionless block chain could support this. It just so happens that the current such block chain that is the most secure and widely used belongs to Bitcoin.

I'm aware of that, along with the long-standing preference of the IMF that China allow their currency to devalue. That doesn't change the fact that this sudden drop of 4.65% over three days is quite dramatic/aggressive. It will definitely ripple through world markets, and will likely influence quite a few nations' monetary policies in the near future.  
As a master market manipulator, I think China as a nation has chosen a very opportune time for this action. It should boost their export industries, provide a spark to the economy and effectively reduce the effect of RMB denominated debt in one stroke. It also serves as another lever for them in trying to counter their imploding stock market. But China's population is one of the biggest savers of money on the planet, and these moves will not be looked upon kindly by those watching the buying power of their savings shrink at the government whim.

I agree that it does in the very short term. The Chinese government has proven very adept at manipulating markets, but I doubt that even they can keep all inflation from their internal markets permanently. I can describe at least one avenue in which inflation would trickle into their domestic markets: unless they impose draconian foreign trade controls (which would stymie the beneficial foreign trade effect of devaluing their currency), international demand for suddenly cheaper Chinese goods and services will rise. As this happens, those same goods and services will become harder to come by on the domestic market, thereby resulting in upward pressure on the domestic prices for those goods and services.

@_date: 2015-08-07 05:23:56
OK, I've read the entire document and here's my take:  
TL;DR: This is a long document filled with marketing fluff, vague assertions, double-speak, and far too much outright BS. There is essentially *no "there" there*, and it's almost entirely devoid of substance. No clear or detailed explanation of how any degree of a permissioned ledger can be trusted, verified or determined to be indisputable by any of its participants is supplied, and definitely no justification for requiring the extensive overhead of a block chain based system is explained when no clear returns over existing technologies are on offer.  
----  
If one makes an innovative and new assertion: that a permissioned block chain can be used in a verifiable and indisputable way, I believe the claimant should clearly establish their case. Hopefully, something akin to the clarity in Nakamoto's Bitcoin white paper. I could not find anything close to that in this text, nor any reference to where such a document could be found.  
Instead, it spends time re-branding things like "mining" as "committing", and cryptocurrency tokens as "junk". Multiple paragraphs are spent explaining why the benefits of permissionless block chains and distributed systems are not only negligible or unimportant, but making the extraordinary assertion that they may in fact be *undesirable*. Wut?  
In particular, the entire section on "Examining Trustlessness" is disingenuous to an extreme. Remarkable effort is expended trying to convince the reader that existing legacy systems and safeguards (such as costly banking insurance) render trustlessness redundant, completely ignoring the fact that trustlessness has the potential to remove or minimize the need for such costly bureaucracies in the first place. It goes so far as to fault Bitcoin for trusting "... the manufacturers of their computers and operating systems on which they run the Bitcoin client...," never explaining how Eris plans to improve upon this issue. If no improvement is possible from Eris, why even raise the point?  
Trustless systems are further faulted for being irreversible, ignoring existing and developing solutions using multisig and smart contract capability. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the same document, they boast of eris:db's sophisticated design based on the same smart contract technology previously glossed over while critiquing trustlessness. When trustless systems are described as rigid and impractical to modify, the inflexibilty of a launched eris:db block chain is painted as robust and dependable. Elsewhere, they ignore the fact that consensus change can and does take place in trustless systems, but play up the easily changeable and flexible nature of eris:db. So are eris:db block chains robust and dependable, or easily changeable and flexible? I sense a contradiction here. In addition, who can be trusted to make such changes and why this trust should exist is also completely ignored.  
Upon reaching the end of the document, I asked myself, "OK, if I accept their arguments that all the advantages and innovation brought by trustless decentralized systems are not really significant pluses, what exactly does their permissioned block chain concept then bring?" Using block chains **is really the long way around** in accomplishing a goal. If it does not bring actual, recognizable advantages, implementing one is simply wasting effort and introducing unnecessary complexity. I could find almost nothing in this entire text that addresses this conundrum.  
The one innovation that I think I took away is that if eris:db works as promised, it could be a single client that could work with a vast multitude of differently configured block chains. However, if they can't concisely show how any one block chain on this spectrum from almost trustless to highly permissioned can *actually* achieve their claims, I can't say I see the utility in such an innovation.  
I'm not averse to experimentation with these kind of permissioned block chains, however Eris and others in this space are clearly touting them as finished, revolutionary products. This strikes me as egregious over promising. If the utility of a new idea has not ever been demonstrated or even clearly explained, I much prefer an under-sell, with an objective eye on possible points of failure.  
I hope you also read this document in detail, and I'm very open to being shown that I misread some or all of it, or that I've just gone completely off the deep end. At this point I have to say I'm very skeptical of Eris as a company, and that my overall suspicions about any permissioned block chain organization have only been strengthened.

It's unfortunate that such incorrect usages exist. The primary elements of Bitcoin that users should focus on are the "addresses" and "private keys".

Generate a paper wallet, and send to the paper wallet's address (as always, don't lose or expose the associated private key or you've lost your bitcoins).  
If you **do** want to create a "cold" paper wallet, the process is more involved. Here's a good guide:  
  
But I'm not clear on why you need a paper wallet for your stated purpose. A mobile wallet, such as [Mycelium]( on Android or [Copay]( on iOS would probably be better.  
If you insist on receiving funds on a paper wallet, you can't verify receipt entirely offline. You'd need access to the Internet to check funds arriving at the paper wallet's address using one or more block explorers (warning, when doing this you must trust the block explorer service providers). Some good block explorers include [Blockr.io]( [BlockCypher]( and [BlockTrail](

Look, all of your formulas look like they start with the 50% probability assumption. That only works for things like flipping coins. Graph out the resulting distribution around a 10 minute mean using your formulas, and you'll get a symmetric bell curve. I'm not going to recheck all the math, because it's been so long for me I'm not sure I'd trust the result, but that alone makes it obvious it's wrong. For block times, the distribution is bounded on the left, but unbounded on the right. Your math simply doesn't account for that. The formulas in the link I sent you do. They were put forth by knowledgeable people such as Meni Rosenfleld (sp?), but more than that, they sound correct and familiar from my days when I used this stuff more often. Now if nothing I've said convinces you, I'm sorry, you'll have to look elsewhere because it's the best I can do.  
EDIT: perhaps the value lambda is what you need, if it's what will change the distribution from a symmetric one, to an asymmetric one that's long tail and unbounded on the right.

I entirely disagree because any subsidy (even if only transaction fees) will always be enough for *some* miners in a system where difficulty automatically adjusts. But since Bitcoin is an open system, you or anyone else are free to test these assumptions by trying to implement such a change and seeing the result in the open market. One point you may want to keep in mind: after any such hard fork, those who held tokens before the split would have the same amount of tokens on both branches immediately following the fork. Presuming both branches exist long enough for a market to develop, whichever branches is seen to offer more value and utility will quickly induce holders of tokens on the opposing branch to exchange them for something else (quite likely tokens on the more successful branch). This positive feedback loop would quickly drive the value of the tokens on the losing branch down. So whether you're right or wrong about your contention, you should know quickly after the hard fork occurs.  
EDIT: grammar

You won't be earning a few bucks a day in Bitcoin without ASICs unless you already have a warehouse full of the latest GPUs available (in which case why don't you sell your extra hardware for profit instead). The key to getting any return at all (I'm talking on the order of pennies per day or less) would be essentially free electricity and minimizing any hardware costs. I'm pretty sure with the best current GPUs you can find some shares (which are the minimum units that show some work was done) at mining pools, but I have no idea how long it would take you to reach a minimum withdrawal amount (assuming its doable at all).  


Unless you've got some pretty powerful GPUs laying around, you might need to start with a cheap ASIC to see anything actually happen at all (i.e. finding a significant number of shares). But remember, even with free electricity, you might never recoup the cost of even a $3 USB ASIC in your lifetime since difficulty just seems to keep increasing.  
Anyone serious about trying to make a profit mining these days would need to start with one or more serious ASICs, like this:  
along with the needed power supplies, a place with enough cooling and that's tolerant of the resulting fan noise, and of course, free or nearly free electricity for the 3-9 months that it'll take to break even (**if** that's even possible). And there are uncertainties like possible big increases in hashing technology that could happen between now and break even that could derail the chance to make a profit entirely. Another approach would be just mine as long as you think you're profitable, and then try to sell your equipment to recoup costs when you think you're falling behind the curve. A bankroll of $1,000 to $2,000 is probably minimum to start such an effort, plus you should really know what you're doing, and that it still would be a gamble.  
No matter how you approach it, it's a really tough proposition now. That's why I emphasize the hobby aspect. If you just want to learn the process and don't mind spending say $20 to $50 a month, you can learn all the ins and outs. If you get comfortable with the process, you could then re-evaluate if you want to make a big investment and try to make a profit (an effort that would be risky and is guaranteed to take a lot of time).  
Some two or more years ago, the chance to make a profit mining was much higher. These days, if you think the value of bitcoin will appreciate you should really consider just buying some, or exchanging goods or services for some. Otherwise, you better enjoy the mining process itself, because there's a very good chance that's all you'll get out of it, and the whole adventure could net cost you some money in the end.

It's a simple fact that increasing money supply decreases the value of holdings. That's basic economics and is backed by centuries of observed evidence.  
I have no idea who you're referring to when you say that "bitcoin people are obsessed with money supply". You're referring to a very diverse group with very independent ideas. I for one acknowledge the fact that fixed or deflationary money supplies serve to protect existing holdings and leave it at that. In contrast, you seem to be quite fixated on the issue, to the point that you must vaguely hand wave about numerous random economic terms without bringing any specific relation of them to the concepts we're discussing.

Increasing this limit would require a hard fork. Should such a fork ever occur, those that don't want the limit raised would simply stay with the version of Bitcoin that does not make the change. Those that do could elect to move to the newer version with the higher/removed limit, but that would in-effect be a new cryptocurrency that would have to establish its own market value.

I think where you had 2 in your equation compared to e (~2.718281) somehow arose from the symmetric/asymmetric issue, but it's beyond me to prove this.  
So check my math. Taking my original incorrectly remembered time of 2 hours and 40 minutes and 369,365 blocks, we would expect to see ~0.04 instances of a block time that long or more. Pretty unlikely.  
Taking the 2 hour and 9 minute value, we'd expect to see ~0.923 instances, much more possible. As you mentioned, it's like the real interval was less due to clock inaccuracies at the miners, but exactly how much I haven't been able to document.

The "about 10 minutes" has always just been a stochastic average that the automatically adjusting difficulty tries to target. The whole 2 hours and 40 minutes figure was just me pulling from my dim memory, but it turns out I wasn't *that* far off. Of course, if the information was needed for some kind of legal or forensic purpose, all of the blocks in question would need to get fixed against a single, accurate clock.

But let me understand your point. Inflation hasn't been happening, so clearly it won't be happening again. Ever? Consider the last major economic boom in the U.S. During the 90s, interest rates were being raised in an effort to reign in the overheating economy. For a good period, there did not seem to be a discernable effect. Yet when the market did turn around again after the dot-com bubble burst, even aggressive rate lowering was not enough to stem the the slide. Historically it seems to me that pulling economic levers often has a difficult to predict lag before an effect is seen, and when it manifests there can be an unexpected overshot the other direction. So after this recent sustained period of worldwide QE and near-zero and sometimes effectively negative interest rates, could forces for the next change in market direction be lurking somewhere unseen in the world economy? I for one wouldn't be surprised. I can't tell you if they're will be sudden high inflation, or if there will be, I can't predict what the mechanism will be that brings it about. But observing how economies cycle through out history, I'm definitely not discounting it.  
One possibility is fairly obvious to me at this point. If China continues its aggressive currency devaluation, distorting international trade in the process, other susceptible economies may be forced to respond in kind to try to maintain their foreign trade competitiveness. If this sparks a currency war race to the bottom, I could easily imagine sudden inflation in many, if not all, markets.

You may already know, but regular Coinbase offers an instant buy feature if you add a Visa card as a backup payment method. The instant buy limit is rather low, though.

Short answer to your subject line: almost never.  
Too start with, if you're not looking to mine just as a hobby, but to actually make a profit you'll need to have access to large amounts of free or nearly free electricity. For more specifics, plug your numbers into a good mining calculator, like this one:  
Make sure you use realistic estimates of the difficulty increase over the period you'll be trying to recoup your costs. I'd recommend **never** buying mining hardware in a pre-sale, as that has gone wrong in too many cases.  
Since you mentioned you're in I.T., realize that mining for Bitcoin and almost all altcoins is now being dominated by ASICs. The era of GPUs is largely past. There are *some* altcoins that are optimized so that GPUs and even CPUs may still be practical, but generally these altcoins have very small markets and are not highly valued.

Those that know about Bitcoin might find it attractive, so if anything it should be an upward pressure on bitcoin price. Assuming this is correct, bitcoin price currently falling would mean this effect is too small to change the market's tendency right now.

Like coin.mx in what sense (I've never used coin.mx)? If you're in the U.S. [Circle]( allows instant buy via ACH after verification. [Coinbase]( also allows ACH instant buy after verification, but also requires adding a Visa card as a backup payment source. Coinbase has also started to expand outside the U.S. [LibertyX]( allows nearly instant buys at physical locations with cash. ~~[Snapcard.io]( also claims to allow instant ACH buys, but states that you can do so on the same day that you sign up.~~ [Trucoin]( allows apparently instant credit card buys on the day of sign-up, but is not available in all states.  
More widely, there's [LocalBitcoins]( [the Mycelium Android wallet's local trader feature]( and buying using the bank deposit method with [Bitquick.co]( (also available in Taiwan and India). Outside the U.S., [247Exchange]( offers instant buys, though possibly not using all of their available payment methods. You could also use [one of these services]( to search for an ATM/BTM/vending machine near you.

For future reference, whenever [mempools are abnormally full of transactions]( (recently there's been a lot of "spam" from someone trying to disrupt or "test" the network), bump your fee some to be sure of a fast confirmation -- 2x or 3x is probably good enough (so you go ~$0.03 to ~$0.10 in most cases, it's not a killer).

This is from memory, so take it with a grain of salt. You register at LibertyX's website, then you go into a LibertyX accepting location and pay cash using the Qpay bill pay system. Just follow the exact instructions on LibertyX's site for providing Qpay specifics. You'll receive a PIN in return that you can immediately redeem using LibertyX's website. The bitcoin transaction to the address you specify is then broadcast on the network almost immediately.  
I believe they sell in denominations of $50, $100 and $300. I think max per day is four PINs or $1,000 worth (no more than $2,500 per week).

I've thought about this. I think it would be reasonable to display a prominent notice that appropriate miners' fees should be included, and to have an "Agree to Terms and Conditions" screen the fine print of which would explain that a payment with too low a fee density would be returned to the sending addresses upon X confirmations (minus minimal required miners' fees -- this part could be covered by the merchant after the fact at their discretion), but completing the transaction now would require a resend with an appropriate fee density.

A recent soft fork required 95% of mining to accept it before going into effect. The threshold was reached, and the network transitioned. Unfortunately, several mining pools which collectively had &gt;51% of the global hash rate reported accepting the soft fork ~~*but did not follow through by adhering to the rules of the soft fork*~~ *but proceeded to use SPV mining that did not validate previous blocks before mining futher*. Hence, they mined new blocks atop an invalid block. At one point the invalid chain was as much as six blocks longer than the valid chain. There have been no reports of users' funds affected. So far only the mining pools that accepted BIP66 but did not follow its rules, and perhaps mining pools running on old pre-0.9.5 nodes, have lost rewards.  
EDIT: corrected about SPV mining

Bitcoin now has a known monetary distribution rate with a known maximum limit. That is priced into everyone's value estimates for the price of a bitcoin. Changing that as you suggest effectively adds to the money supply, decreasing the value of existing holdings.

Many of the posts here have responded well to the text of your post, but in response to the subject line, Bitcoin's timestamped and verifiably immutable world wide ledger (or WWL) is an enabling platform. Just like Facebook, Amazon, eBay and Youtube are not the Internet, but are each enabled by its existence, Bitcoin's evolving ability to support smart contracts will spur future innovation that's largely unimaginable right now. Some examples exist already, such as the various implementations of [colored coins]( [prediction markets]( or multisig security and escrow. Some, like the [Lightning Network]( are just on the horizon. More broadly, Bitcoin will support the development of [Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)]( These DAOs would themselves be able to interact in financial markets just like people can in our current economy. Machines and digital entities trading value *as virtual individuals*. This will be key for the [Internet of Things]( but could more generally revolutionize areas such as financial technology, governance, law, healthcare, etc., completely aside from what might happen within purely digital realms.

Even in recent times both the U.S. and EU have not had a complete year of zero or negative inflation. Inflation may have been low, or in the EU's case negative when measured on a monthly time scale, but in both cases always present and positive on a yearly average.  
I don't know much about Japan aside from the fact that they've been struggling with a decades long recession and are groaning under a mountain of debt. I suspect their case is relatively unique, but I don't think you can fairly extrapolate broad generalizations from a single country's experience in any case.  
Moreover, assuming that years of QE and historically low interest rates will somehow *never* be reflected in inflation going forward is simply ignoring economic principles.

I'm almost certain it can't, because values below the 600s mean are bounded by zero (actually, they will really be bounded by a small but non-zero value due to propagation, etc), however values above the mean are in effect unbounded.

ITT: consensus seems to be that running multiple nodes at the same data center is "worthless". It's clearly not as good as running a node on independent hardware at an independent network location, but worthless? Each Digital Ocean (DO) node is administered by its subscriber using parameters and policies they choose. Each can eventually represent that subscriber's views on Bitcoin by choosing different code to run. Each has a chunk of DO's data center bandwidth, so additional nodes add to overall Bitcoin network capability (with respect to throttling by DO, of course it can't add overall bandwidth beyond DO's maximum capability -- I would expect them to add to their total bandwidth as their subscriber base grows). Different account instances may run on different physical servers, providing resilience. Each separate node represents an individual machine target to external hackers. I bet there are more positive points that I'm missing.  
To me, that's far from worthless.

This option is fairly common. If you're uncomfortable revealing your password (but are OK with the rest of the process), go to your bank account and change its password to a secure throwaway. Come back to Circle and complete the verification using the throwaway password, then once verification is complete you can restore your normal password on your bank account.

Change this up and assume the transaction between Alice and Bob used USD. Bob accepts USD using a payment provider that immediately converts the funds to Euros before depositing to his account. It beggars belief that any "journalist" would thereby claim that Bob is not really accepting USD for such transactions, and that USD is not really a currency.

The global market for bitcoin is not very liquid, so if you must sell as quickly as possible you'd need to expect tremendous slippage in price. You'd probably need to sell simultaneously on several large exchanges just to get the process done. The result would net significantly less than the ~$256 million the current market price might suggest, but the exact amount would requiring summing up the orders you'd fill on all of the exchanges you'd use.  
If selling that quickly was not a requirement, there are many ways you likely would make more by selling gradually over a longer period of time. You could sell in bundles on exchanges, allowing the price to settle and recover between batches. Or you could try to arrange your own direct or OTC transaction, perhaps with one or more large mining organizations. Lastly, you could work with a company like [SecondMarket]( that specializes in these sorts of transactions.

Personally, I see no problem with this whatsoever. Markets will react the same way they do to almost everything in economics that lacks perfect knowledge. If bitcoins may or may not have been destroyed, or if missing coins may appear at some point in the future, the market will operate based on *expectation and possibility*.  
In your extreme example, certainly if a large amount of uncertainty  applies to 99.999% of all bitcoin, that would have an effect on the market and the utility of bitcoin as a currency would likely be reduced as a result of increased volatility. But I don't consider such a scenario coming to pass is realistic.  
Incidentally, this same problem applies to all conventional forms of currency as well. In most cases, there is no way to absolutely confirm amounts of fiat or gold have been destroyed, or that they won't reappear later. Worse, though, central bank policies act to *ensure* uncertainty about total fiat money supply always exists. I for one prefer to use a system that has *less* imperfect knowledge, given a choice.

@_date: 2015-04-10 14:40:56
A solo miner would be risking the loss of an entire block reward in the event another block is found by the rest of the network before the Finney attack is completed. This would make the price of the service quite high. OTOH, anyone hijacking a pool for this purpose would need to make sure the attack is a huge score, because the hijacker becomes exposed in the event of success or failure.  
I do agree that gift card services represent tempting targets for a Finney attack. Not only do they offer moderately high value transfer, but the services are available anytime and from anywhere, making the timing coordination of an attack trivial once the malicious miner finds the block to be withheld.  
Still, I'm doubtful that a gift card fraud would present enough return to motivate a Finney attack.
@_date: 2015-04-11 13:01:27
Your suggested approach would almost never work if the target or their merchant service provider just monitors many nodes before approving the transaction. Unfortunately, I haven't heard definitively if monitoring multiple nodes is standard for companies like Bitpay or Coinbase.

Just from one or even a handful of addresses I believe you're correct. Certainly it would be bad practice for the vendor to reveal the master key to anyone unless legally compelled to, but if law enforcement is diligent enough they could simply ask the vendor how they received past payments? If it turns out that HD was used, then they'd just check if the claimed receive address OP sent to corresponds to the old master key. If so, case closed. If they find that the master key changed suddenly only after OP's complaint, that's also basically case closed. I don't think it'd be practical for a dishonest vendor to start with HD, and then try to quickly change the entire system to one using a pool of random addresses just to try to dodge law enforcement. Even if they did try this, it'd likely come out in an investigation.  
Realistically, though, no law enforcement is going to go through all this work for a simple customer/business disagreement.  
After thinking about this, though, it's probably a good convention that honest vendors should use HD since it serves to protect merchants and customers. If this becomes standard, any business using a pool of random addresses that also becomes involved in numerous customer complaints would be viewed with suspicion.

A reversible payment network requires a centralized system. You can easily build such a system on top of a decentralized one, but not the other way around. If you and enough other people prefer a fee-based reversible system to the multisig escrow and other potential P2SH solutions, someone will eventually build a PayPal or a credit card-type system on top of Bitcoin that uses bitcoin as units. Personally, I don't think there is enough demand or profit possibility to motivate the building of such a system now, but if Bitcoin grows, it may happen eventually.
@_date: 2015-04-13 11:57:35


Yes, but the advantage only becomes apparent if you're a) lucky, or b) attack over a long enough time scale. My point is the with b) you'll be discovered and prosecuted.  


I contend it's very much accurate enough within six blocks to indicate a very significant drop if the global hashrate halved or more over that period. Someone running statistical tools could have a routine that gave the probability of a 51% attack happening given the data being seen. I suspect very high likelihoods with 4 or 5 blocks. I do not think your attack could occur under such a short time scale.  


You miss my point here. The attacker would want to get away with his double-spend *and* not lose his massive 4 or 5 blocks worth of block reward. If he was planning on giving up all of the block rewards to begin with, the attack would need to be for an extremely high, and very suspicious amount. However, I suspect with most mining pools, the block reward is not directly under a single person's control, so if he wants it he needs to hang around 100 confirmations minimum, giving more time for someone to catch him.  
But not only this, the cost of the attack must factor in the multitude of ways the attack could fail, and just end up costing the lost 4 or 5 blocks worth of block reward (a potential ~$23,000 to ~$30,000 loss at current rates).  


Sorry, I didn't see you're signing off from this conversation before my replies. I agree with your general sentiments about the 51% attack (that it's not too likely), and that mining centralization is best avoided, but I'm still unconvinced about the viability of using an exchange directly as a target.  
Thanks for the discussion and mental exercise.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but initial consumer access to LN is expected to be via a hub-and-spoke model. Hubs can certainly choose to prevent transactions they dislike, and they can also be coerced by outside organizations. If a decentralized routing system is eventually developed for LN it may then be possible to avoid hubs, but any effort from a centralized company (e.g. Blockstream) to develop such a routing system could easily be quashed by outside pressure.

But the individuals can pull control of the hash rate out from under the attacker.  


It doesn't matter. During the attack period, global hashrate would be more than effectively halved. Legit blocks would be taking more than twice as long as they normally would to be discovered. This anomaly would quickly be obvious to all of the Bitcoin community. In fact, I'd be surprised if there aren't multiple automated scripts running somewhere around the clock to flag such possible anomalies immediately.
Say you do manage to get double-spent funds credited to an exchange that needs only 3 confirms, you'll then need time to make your trade and withdraw before you can publish your hidden chain. Perhaps you can find an incompetent exchange, but any careful organization will be watching for double-spends and rapidly suspend credited funds once discovered. I wouldn't be surprised if it's standard procedure to wait on processing a withdrawal for the period of some number of confirmations if a recent deposit had been made just prior to the withdrawal request. This would be quite effective to detect and defend against such an attack.  
Meanwhile, for the duration of your attack, legit blocks are still taking more than twice as long to appear on average as they should, by now for at least 3 or 4 blocks. So at this point you'd be racing against the possibility that your attempt is discovered by pools or miners and you lose some or all of your hashing power (you only need to lose enough to drop you below 51%), or that the legit chain gets lucky and finds the next block before you, stymieing you from being able to publish your hidden chain unless your hidden mining can get ahead again (and thus exposing you to even more discovery risk by making the growing statistical anomalies more obvious). Including the consideration of all this uncertainty makes double-spend attacks very unappealing.  
And there are more downsides to consider should an attack fail. Not only could the attacker be exposed to potential prosecution or retribution, but he would have lost his legit share of at least 75+ BTC of mining rewards. There'd be a good chance he'd be found liable by miners who lost their profits, along with any legit reputation he previously may have had. At this point, even if he somehow avoids prison, he'd basically need to live the rest of his life on the lam. Ironically, this last part is true even if his attack succeeds, but in that case, at least he'd have whatever ill-gotten gains he managed to steal to help him.  
EDIT: There've got to be easier and more effective ways to be a thief.

@_date: 2015-04-13 11:43:30
 &gt; ... A single long block gap is enough for an attacker...  
You're forgetting, your own attack scenario proposed an exchange that accepts a deposit in as little as **three blocks**. So you'd have to deposit, wait, trade, then try to withdraw. Here's where any smart exchange would check to see if you're withdrawing an amount close to the amount of any recent deposits, and if so, wait for an arbitrary number of blocks. Even if this is not the case, there are often delays withdrawing from exchanges, a careful one wouldn't need to announce anything at all. Just hold back your withdrawal until they feel secure. If you complain, just play it off like withdrawal congestion or the like.  


And I'll say it one more time, the global estimate is quite accurate and up to date enough.
@_date: 2015-04-05 11:50:14
I've seen this claimed many times, but actually it's not true. A low bitcoin price does not prevent anyone from being able to make a transaction of arbitrarily large value. What it does do is ensure that any such transaction will suffer from high slippage. So if the bitcoin price is $1, and you need to buy a $21 million yacht in bitcoin, as you exchange your USD for BTC, you'll be driving the price of bitcoin up enormously from it's $1 starting point. Eventually you'll have $21 million worth of bitcoin, but the ending price of bitcoin by that time will be *much* higher than $1.  
A large Bitcoin market cap simply minimizes the slippage involved in high value transactions.

This isn't a good idea, particularly if the transaction is for any significant amount. However, if I had to do it and I was OK with the risk, I'd request the sender overpay the transaction fee (x5 is probably good), then I'd check to make sure that  transaction appeared on *several different* block explorers (without getting flagged as a double-spend) before completing the in-person exchange. You could probably do all of this within a few minutes.

Are you familiar at all with statistical analysis? A single block gap time gives you very little information. Two provide significantly more, and so on. If global hashrate halved, statistically speaking each new block will reveal more evidence of it. For people in charge of monitoring such things for possible attacks, their meters will likely start to attract their interest at 2 or 3 blocks, at 3 or 4 blocks they'd be starting to get significantly relevant information that something could be wrong. Meanwhile, if they're doing their jobs, they're already checking around to see what the source of the problem might be. By 4 or 5 blocks it be getting quite obvious something is up. Now, as you say, this process is probabilistic, but an attacker would need to count on being extraordinarily lucky to go 5 or 6 blocks without things looking suspicious. Factor in the chances of having their chain beat during the attack, and losing all the block awards should things go bad against them; or that they either succeed and elude detection, or fail and elude detection, but then are later discovered within the 100 confirmations required for the coinbase from their hidden blocks to vet. Remember, exchanges may already have policies in place where newly deposited funds cannot be immediately withdrawn until an arbitrary number of confirmations passes. This alone would prevent this possible attack. And meanwhile, the attacker still needs to be conducting trades, likely of suspiciously high volume over a very short time period. There's just too many ways such an escapade could end up costing the attackers rather than making them a windfall.  
Global hashrate is an estimate, but it is quite accurate based on a long history and constant trend monitoring. It is never off by 25%, which is the minimum error range that would be necessary to have a chance of missing a 50% deviation. In fact, the many real-time, web hashrate monitors may themselves be the tip off that an attack is occurring.  
If you can't see the logic to my arguments, we'll just have to agree to disagree. But know that any further arguments you make would need to be far better than what you've presented so far to convince me to change my mind. Alternatively, you could come up with a different short-time 51% attack that is much more profitable or more likely to succeed, but this particular attack scenario seems unconvincing to me.

Therefore, anyone selling irreversible bitcoin by credit card transaction is opening themselves up to tremendous risk. That's why for merchants, selling bitcoin by credit card is not popular, easy, fast or cheap. The cheapest and easiest ways to buy bitcoin involve less reversible methods of electronic transactions where the risk is more manageable, such as ACH bank transfer in the US (after carefully verifying the customer's ID). If you don't have a bank account, or are unwilling to share your bank information with established companies like [Coinbase]( [Circle]( or [Celery]( check if there's a [LibertyX]( location near you so that you can buy with cash.  
If you're not in the US, this site has some buy options organized by country:  
  
And LocalBitcoins and Mycleium Android Wallet's Local Trader allow you to arrange buys directly from Bitcoin users around the world.
Lastly, you could Google for a Bitcoin ATM or vending machine near you.

That was the original commenter's point, but I think there's some truth in it. But you have a point as well.  
At any time, even if Bitcoin has a low valuation, you could put enough value into it to transmit that high value quickly and for a small miner's fee. But, if you're doing this for a large enough value when the overall valuation Bitcoin is comparatively low, you will see enormous slippage *and*, if you wait to conduct your transaction, you risk the value you invested into the market eroding due to buying power leaving the market over time (OTOH this could move the other way if your large buy sparks a market bull run). I guess I could call this price hysteresis, but I'm sure there's a more accurate economic term for it.  
So of course Bitcoin *has more utility* if it has a higher market cap, but it can always be used (especially quickly) to transfer any amount of value. The risk of some loss (or you could consider any such loss part of the transfer cost) during such an effort is correspondingly higher depending on how small Bitcoin's market cap is at the time relative to the size of your attempted transaction.

I'm not sure exactly how "easy" such an attack would be, but certainly less involved and expensive than a *Finney attack*. The success rate of such attacks ultimately hinges on the effectiveness of the prevention techniques employed by the merchant service provider. Any double-spend attack not using mining power control still requires code that is, if not custom, at least carefully configured with significant knowledge of both Bitcoin transactions and details of the mining network. Then, if even moderately effective prevention techniques are being used by the merchant service provider, the attacker would need to plan on making multiple attempts and likely failing several times (i.e. unintentionally completing multiple purchases) before accomplishing any double-spend. If Gyft/eGifter are experiencing significant fraud from double-spends, this might be the sort of pattern they could watch for. Meanwhile, they'd be collecting added revenue from the multiple *failed* double-spend attempts, perhaps somewhat mitigating losses.  
I would be very interested to learn exactly how effective the use of good fee monitoring and of listening for double-spends during transaction propagation are in preventing non-Finney attacks.  


Do we really know with certainty what is happening at Gyft, though? [This thread]( suggests it's a temporary situation that is getting corrected. Admittedly, it's equally likely the responding support representatives have incomplete knowledge about Gyft's situation. Let's see how it shakes out.


Gyft and eGifter may be rather unique in this circumstance. I suspect most other merchants that accept zero-confirmation transactions either require in-person interaction (which ensures the attacker be exposed to witnesses/video), or have a built-in process delay (such as packaging and shipping orders that were placed online) that allows for confirmations to arrive before the product or service is delivered.

I agree that there's an insane amount of intrusive and arguably *illegal* information gathering going on, but agencies just end up with mountains of data. Someone's gotta make sense of it all and since the five eyes guys haven't proved that they can handle that yet, I don't give smaller agencies much chance. I just saw a PBS Frontline episode that laid out the number of times major intelligence agencies missed chances to get up on [David Coleman Headley]( (an American-born terrorist that served as the scout and advance man for Lashkar-e-Taiba's Mumbai attack. Granted, data analysis capabilities will improve, but today it's still pretty hit or miss.  


It's a good point that the NSA-types may gain an advantage by including their own monitored/tagged coins in Darkwallet mixing, but if use becomes truly widespread I'm not sure if even that tactic would be a magic bullet.

If you're in the US there are several ACH bank transfer methods. Probably the most common are [Coinbase]( [Circle]( and [Celery]( Know that all three comply with AML/KYC so they are not the best options if privacy is a concern. Typically, they also have verification process before allowing you to complete your first purchase.  
[Snapcard]( is a newer option that claims to allow instant purchasing as soon as you enter ACH bank transfer information. They're also a US-based company, so I'd expect AML/KYC compliance.
If you insist on buying with PayPal, you'll find your options are limited and expensive due to the risk to sellers from Paypal's dispute policies. Google "virwox paypal" or "brawker" if you'd still like to try this route.

Yes, that would simply mean the entire market of bitcoins is limited to $21 million when valued in USD. Why is that a fault in my reasoning? This would be true of *any* currency at some arbitrary figure. If you could print more of the currency in question, the overall value does not increase and you *still* could not purchase your target item.
What would increase the total value of the currency is if someone possessed something of value and was willing to exchange some or all of it for the currency in question, with enough such exchanges the value of the currency then rises.

Yes, but since a range of countermeasures of varying effectiveness exist, tracing might not be trivial. The pursuer must have the ability to do it, know where to look, and know what they are looking for. NSA or the like have this, but local prosecutors and police may not, or if they do someone would still need to justify the needed expenditures.  
If you get right down to it, I suppose it's the same with any form of value transfer. Given limitless resources and using modern techniques, I suppose no transaction can remain anonymous. If the task is difficult, it would just take a truly extreme crime to motivate extensive pursuit. In the event that you've done something for which the government is willing to leverage NSA resources *and* to reveal the methods used in open court to prosecute you, I don't think Bitcoin, Tor (or I2P, Freenet et. al.), or Darkwallet stand a chance of saving you.

Sorry that you got hit. Is there no way to recover your data from backup? Alternatively, have you tried all the publicly available keys and decryption methods (here's a [search for CryptoLocker keys]( It grinds my gears that these crooks are getting paid.  
If you still need to buy the bitcoin, can you get the $800 in cash from a corporate petty cash fund or as a cash advance from the corporate credit card? Cash buy methods tend to have faster verification and higher limits. There are several ways to get $800 worth of Bitcoin quickly in the U.S. with cash: [LibertyX]( (check their website for a location near you, how much you can buy depends on your level of verification), [Bitquick.co]( [LocalBitcoins]( [Paxful]( or you could use one of [these online maps to search for a Bitcoin ATM/BTM/vending machine near you]( (limits vary, and always call ahead to make sure the machine is still there, accessible, and working when you want to use it).  
If you can only use the corporate credit card online, another option (which probably still has a low buy limit) is [Trucoin]( though this option is not available in AK, CO, DC, HI, IA, IL, LA, MD, NH, NY, NC, OH, OK, TN, VA, VT, WA, and WI.

Thanks for the links, but your original post made it sound like there were multiple police raids. I'm assuming that's not the case then.  
Buying Amazon gift cards in particular at Purse has apparently been problematic, though I wonder if that's any more the case than any Amazon gift purchase involving an Amazon gift card (even when Purse isn't even involved). To the contrary, I've seen users posting their good experiences buying third party gift cards from Amazon via Purse, but it might be good to be wary of that as well.  
Still, without sourcing the claims of large scale fraud at Purse, it seems the claims are overblown to me. The longer they exist without getting shut down via law enforcement, or via some kind of civil cease and desist legal action from credit card companies or Amazon themselves, the more it seems Purse may be generally on the up and up.  
e: Couldn't keep up with your ninja edits, but I still don't see any reports of more than one police raid. Everything else seems like it may be the same kind of fraud Amazon has to deal with every day without Purse even in the picture.

Assuming it's a long-term situation, or that the controlling party pisses off the Bitcoin community by manipulating the block chain? My guess would be a hard fork to a different hashing algorithm.

The [block chain]( is a type of data structure that was pioneered by [Bitcoin]( The Bitcoin block chain is currently the world's largest and most established by far, so your question can't really be answered as asked. However, your confusion is understandable since many in business and media are starting to recognize the benefits that the Bitcoin block chain provides, but would prefer to divorce it from bitcoin the digital token (variously considered a currency, commodity, unit of account, etc.) Since the block chain is just a data structure, there can be an infinite number of other block chains, but there will always only be one Bitcoin block chain (putting aside some technicalities).  
Other [cryptocurrencies]( can exist built on other block chains, and these can and do compete with Bitcoin, but [none is yet close to rivaling Bitcoin's dominant position](  
As employed in Bitcoin, the block chain requires a significant amount of complexity, effort and cost to establish when compared to traditional database-backed solutions, but it's development represents the first practical solution of [a problem that had stumped computer science for over 30 years]( Prior to Bitcoin, a truly permissionless and decentralized payment system/currency/consensus network could not exist.  
The fact that the media and businesses are now starting to publicize "block chain technology" without mentioning the digital token typically required (in Bitcoin's case, bitcoin with a lowercase 'b' is the digital unit) is in my opinion a red herring. In all existing permissionless, decentralized cryptocurrencies, it is the digital token and the overhead of the block chain that makes them possible. Those that trumpet "block chain technology" while ignoring the token or that promote mostly undeveloped and unproven "permissioned" block chains either do not understand that the token and the data structure are both required to achieve Bitcoin's innovative benefits, or are hyping systems which may never offer net advantages over traditional shared database systems.

I think you're right. I just imagine LE could get some sort of subpoena or other court order to compel the production of any master keys in order to check for address matches. That way they'd never need to try the impossible task of working backwards. If this happened, I bet any evidence or court records which involved master keys would get sealed. But if I were the vendor, I'd still switch my HD system to a new seed once court proceedings completed just to be as safe as possible.

Yes, but in my experience, sending the second transaction is the problem. BC.i is connected to a large number of nodes, but they're all interconnected too, right? So if you wait two seconds your original transaction has propagated *widely*. Sending the second from most conventional clients gives a transaction rejected message (this I *have* tried for myself on my Bitcoin Core instance).  
I have realized how you can claim 98% success. You've just got to assume an appropriate amount of fee-gaming between the two transactions (again, assuming you can even get the second transaction into enough nodes on the network). But again, this is why I think careful fee checking should be a priority.

All actual occurrences of the deflationary spiral you present have occurred as the result of failed economic policies that include significant currency manipulation.

There's not much of a direct relationship between mining and number of transactions. Mining is a voluntary activity based on the economics of the process for the individual miner. If more miners elect to mine (global hash rate increases), the Bitcoin protocol adjusts difficulty upwards such that a new block is found on average about every 10 minutes, and total power consumption rises. If fewer miners choose to mine (global hash rate decreases), difficulty gets adjusted downwards (again to maintain the 10 minute average block time), and total energy consumption falls.  
There's no mechanism in the Bitcoin protocol to monitor or manipulate efficiency in terms of power use per transaction. If Bitcoin employed a different consensus strategy, it might consume less energy in total, but personally I haven't heard of another that is convincingly superior without compromising security and/or decentralization. If one is developed in the future and assuming a community consensus is reached on the new system's superiority, Bitcoin can in theory hard fork to a new consensus protocol.

I believe this is somewhat true as far as it goes, but hawala is not nearly as decentralized as the network of trustless nodes in a Bitcoin network. In particular, I doubt that a complete stranger can walk up to a hawaladar and ask to become part of that broker's network (or even to just start the process.) A person would need an "in" or introduction at the very least, and then likely need to earn trust in some fashion. Perhaps a hawaladar in good standing could vouch for a new member, but this would definitely not be open to the general public. In addition, the details of bookkeeping, commissions, and settlement among brokers is likely completely mysterious to someone unfamiliar with hawala, especially since settlement between hawaladars may occur at irregular intervals, and can often be in forms other than via currency. In fact, I would bet each hawaladar's list of contact information for the other brokers in that network is highly protected and considered to have value on its own. Further, since hawala is illegal or at least of questionable legality in many jurisdictions, all members of a particular network would need to trust the others not to divulge their membership under duress. This represents additional motivation for the collective brokers in a network not to accept just anyone that desires to join.  
I'm not sure I agree that hawala "doesn't and can't have effective restrictions from authorities/malicious parties." The identity of hawaladars in any locality would be known to their clients and by extension, the community at large. It would not take much effort for a motivated and resourceful party to find a dealer, and depending on intent, determination and extent of international reach, roll-up an entire network or find and pursue particular clients from there. To some extent the same is true of Bitcoin in a digital sense, but countermeasures for Bitcoin (e.g. Tor, I2P, VPNs, proxies, perhaps even Freenet) seem simpler to put into place and are arguably more effective.
In terms of performance for a client, hawala much more closely approximates the service of conventional forms of money transfer, like Western Union. Brokers must sleep, are sometimes unreachable, take vacations, etc. Bitcoin has proven itself to be [basically always available]( given access to the Internet or even some other communication channel connected to the Bitcoin network. In fact, given the legal uncertainties, I wouldn't be surprised if hawaladars sometimes refuse service to anyone who is a complete stranger within a community.  
Although hawala in real-life may not utilize a value token per se, it does rely on the establishment of trust and conduct within an honor code which is built and maintained through complex social interactions. To me, this could be considered the "currency" of inter-personal communication, something that may be quite difficult to adapt to a self-contained technological system.
You mentioned that hawala could be implemented in a high tech form. Given the wide array of variation and irregularity that seems to be part of real-life hawala networks, I wonder if this is true. If the attempt is made I would be very interested to learn of its particulars. In a working project, it wouldn't surprise me if the part of the system dealing with the reputations, for instance, wound up requiring a token that would acquire value on its own.

Sorry you had so much trouble. If you're not willing to go through the initial hassle and verification processes of [Coinbase]( [Circle]( or [Celery]( [Bitquick.co]( sounds like it might be right for you.  
You complained about low buy limits. With Coinbase in particular, if you go through all of their verification processes, you can typically get a $50,000.00 daily buy limit (for this amount you get the price you purchase at, but you don't receive your BTC immediately -- it typically takes four business days to complete the process). If you add a credit card as a backup payment option, they generally allow you to buy $1,000.00 worth of BTC instantly every week. Be aware, their complete verification processes take a while, and they are pretty extreme in the Bitcoin-space about trying to enforce KYC/AML regulations. If you need privacy or don't want them monitoring where your bitcoin funds go, take precautions.

Yes, the vendor could be dishonest. OP then has a choice: 1) absorb the loss and trash the vendor's reputation using reporting sites, or 2) involve law enforcement and see if they will try to find evidence (which if the vendor is dishonest *and* thorough, may not exist). However, most vendors would use an HD scheme to generate receive addresses. Past transactions would have been sent to addresses created from one seed, and would constitute proof of its prior existence. They'd need to suddenly change seeds *and accidentally* lose the original seed should law enforcement come knocking. This would pretty much be proof of their guilt. In the less likely implementation of a collection of random receive addresses (not using HD), it would be easier for the vendor to hide their duplicity, but they still can't protect their reputation from complaints by screwed over customers.

There's no reason you are *required* to use more than one wallet. But each wallet category offers different features and capabilities. Web wallets are dependent on a centralized provider for normal access, and so are the most centralized of Bitcoin wallet choices available. Should the website become unavailable or the provider go out of business, you may need to use a recovery procedure and start another wallet before you could use your bitcoin funds normally again. On the other hand, web wallets can be accessible anywhere you have access to the Internet without requiring a particular device that has the instance of the wallet client software on it (assuming the web wallet service provider is not down, of course).  
Desktop wallets like Electrum are not fully dependent on any one single centralized service. In particular, Electrum wallets can run connected to any of many available Electrum servers, and should one become unavailable, it will automatically access another (or you can even elect to run your own). But light wallets like Electrum do always require such a connection and so are not as independent as the most decentralized choices, full node wallets like Core, XT, or Armory (though these require significant resources to run and are inconvenient in a number of ways compared to other choices).  
If by "electrum for offline use", you mean using Electrum for offline cold storage, that is an option that is available, but it's a more advanced (and less user friendly) implementation that achieves high security. Whether you choose to use it will depend your desire for the added security while tolerating the reduced accessibility. With good security practices, I'd feel safe keeping a typical checking account balance stored in a 2FA secured web wallet or other "hot" wallet. GreenAddress's multisig implementation gives you even more security than non-multisig web wallets like Blockchain.info's. However, for savings account amounts or larger, I would definitely consider employing some form of cold storage, like Electrum's offline option or purchasing a hardware wallet like a Trezor. Since cold storage takes some familiarity, choose a cold storage option, and implement and practice using it with small amounts at first to become comfortable with all of the steps (including, for instance running the offline Electrum instance from a secure and always offline PC, or alternatively from a PC booted to a standalone secure environment like TAILS).  
Normally, independent wallets like a GreenAddress wallet and an offline instance of an Electrum wallet are not "connected" together. They each manage their own independent pools of private keys. If you wish to have funds from one wallet usable on the other, you'd just send the funds from the source wallet to a receive address generated by the destination wallet via a normal Bitcoin transaction.

@_date: 2015-09-21 07:02:49
I think I'd mostly agree with your timeline if we're still talking about LN as it initially emerged in Joseph and Tadge's original white paper and presentation. AFAIK, those contained no mention of decentralized routing concepts or distributed meshnets. The presentation did, however, discuss implementation of a hub-and-spoke model. If this emerges, I'd guess commercial hubs would start to pop up in the 3 - 6 months after LN becomes final. However, the forgoing discussion was about having lots of individual LN nodes which would not restrict transactions to the likes of Snowden or Assange. Large commercial hubs facilitating the majority of connections between end users (as would exist based on the original LN presentation) could definitely prevent transactions either by their own choice or at the behest of outside agencies.  
If there are decentralized routing schemes for LN or distributed meshnets being developed that might facilitate LN without the hub-and-spoke model, I doubt that they're as far along as LN itself (if for no other reason because LN itself is not yet finalized), but I'd be happy to be proved wrong. Do you have links to whitepapers and such?

Bitcoin Core's coin control feature gives a lot of useful coin age information. If you want to check the details of your existing coins, you'll probably need to import the private keys instead of sending a transaction.

First a few notes about PayPal: When someone sends you funds by PayPal and the balance appears in your account that's not the same as having cash in your hand. If you want cash from your PayPal balance there *might* be ways to get it fairly quickly, but then there will be fees and limits. If you want cash with no fees at all, you must withdraw to your US bank account via ACH transfer, which then introduces the delays of the US banking system. It will often be 3 to 5 business days before you can withdraw your transferred PayPal balance as cash. However, PayPal does provide credit-type services as well as funds transfer, so within their own system they can and do blend the two to help cover up for US banking delays. So if you don't need cash, you may be able to send some or all of your PayPal balance on to the PayPal accounts other friends and family immediately, but they'll then have the same limitations and/or fees should they need cash. You can also likely spend your PayPal balance immediately, though not as widely as credit cards (unless you also qualify for/have their associated debit card). It may also interest you to know that [PayPal is actively working to integrate Bitcoin into their systems and services](  
Now on to Bitcoin, and I'll cut to the chase: in total Bitcoin has a lot of advantages over a system like PayPal, but for the average person, concerns about its current drawbacks may outweigh them, especially if you live in the US and already have access to a relatively modern banking system, credit/debit cards, and services like PayPal and Venmo.  
Most people's biggest concern about Bitcoin right now is its tremendous volatility, and for good reason. It's a very young currency with low liquidity. As a result, it's common for its valuation to fluctuate by as much as 10's of percent (sometimes in hours or even minutes) relative to mature currencies like the US dollar. In fact, bitcoin is in the midst of a 15 month long bear market, having fallen from its all time high of around $1,140 all the way down to around $180. It's currently valued at about $234. To be fair though, some also consider its existing volatility one of its greatest attractions. Skilled day traders (likely a rare and/or short-lived breed) love it, and if you bought around $40 worth of bitcoin five years ago, today it would be worth about $2.34 million. Basically, if you buy and hold bitcoin now, it's as if you're investing in a very risky high-tech start-up. It could exhibit tremendous growth, but the risk that it could crash and burn may be considerable. If Bitcoin continues to grow, as it matures volatility should gradually fall. In fact, [that trend already seems to be apparent]( I'll also mention that merchants can accept payments by bitcoin for much lower (or zero) fees and be completely immune to any volatility risk by using Bitcoin merchant service providers.  
Another issue is the lack of protections for bitcoin. Since cash has been around for hundreds of years, many protections have been established in the financial services built upon it. These often protect the consumer in the event of loss or fraud. Such protections are so well accepted by society that the need for them is seldom considered. For instance, why is insurance *mandated* for banks? Only because historically, banks failed so often and so spectacularly that public outrage forced the government's hand. The costs of these protections are significant and are paid by everyone, whether they need these protections often or if they never use them in their lifetimes. *How* the costs are assessed, however, is well disguised by the industries in question. The fact that these blanket protections exist and that their attendant costs are not obvious to the general public also serves to introduce a [moral hazard]( whereby entrenched incumbents (e.g. the credit card industry) can earn higher short-term profit from dragging their feet instead of quickly instituting newer and safer technologies that would end up saving everyone money, but only in the long run. The resulting weak transactional security of existing systems is an area where Bitcoin with its secure "Push" technology is clearly superior.  
All of the protections of existing financial systems can be created equally well for bitcoin, but at this time few exist. Still, now or in the future, bitcoin offers everyone the ability to perform many of the functions of banks, but without being *required by default* to pay for all of the protections, not to mention the typical banking costs.  
At it's core, Bitcoin is also quite revolutionary. It's so new in concept that people normally find it difficult to grasp and use, much like sending email or trying to navigate the Internet was in the early to mid-90's. Already services and applications exist so that people can use Bitcoin without a full understanding of all of its intricacies, but today even in these situations it's best if the new user has a well-versed guide to introduce them. At this point, to use Bitcoin adeptly, a lot of knowledge needs to be acquired. Bitcoin is a first of its kind digital *thing*, and its owner is fully responsible for securing its possesion. In our everyday lives, we're very familiar with *physical* security and how to establish it, but overall, *digital* security is something nearly everybody can learn more about. As a result, casual online use or storage, particularly of large amounts of bitcoin, can result in losses in a multitude of ways. Although Bitcoin the protocol and network have proven very robust, the well-known problems arise at its edges where bitcoin must be owned and secured. Better solutions are developing rapidly, and some good options already exist, yet the day when every Bitcoin beginner can dive in confidently without the chance of suffering a loss has not yet arrived.  
I can never remember all the advantages of Bitcoin at one sitting, so I'll defer to a couple of links and videos that give a pretty good account:  
  
  
And the videos:
[The Real Value of Bitcoin (less than 7 minutes)](  
[World Bitcoin Network - A Million Killer Apps, Part 1 of 3 (26 minutes)](
Finally, a devil's advocate word on PayPal. Although I think their service is generally fairly good and they seem to be trying to grow and improve, you should be aware that there's a vocal community of their customers (past and present) which is less than satisfied (their experiences illustrate PayPal's shortcomings):

That's a legitimate point. I think the longer you go that a sidelined amount is not used, the higher the chance that it won't be. Yet, on the other hand, as you point out, deflation means that the potential impact of the sidelined amount only tends to grow as time goes by. For markets, this means an interesting dynamic: decreasing chance of an event occurring coupled with increasing possible market impact should the event transpire. Nevertheless, this is still well within the realm of the uncertainties and eventualities that all markets factor in on a daily basis.

I wish I could say Blockchain.info's My Wallet is a good choice, but the truth of the matter is that they've have some rather extraordinary lapses in recent history. Most notably, their wallet implementation has now (twice, I believe) utilized poor sources of entropy which lead to considerable loss of customer funds. It's possible everything is OK now, but they're far from a provider I could really recommend due to their spotty at best track record. Assuming their code is fixed now, as long as you have a backup of your wallet, they do at least allow you to control your own private keys.

Ten minutes worth of disruption is hardly effective. Even a few hours worth would only be a nuisance. Say you try to do this for 48 hours, then the $8,640 starts to become a noticeable figure. And this discounts the fact that legitimate users will adjust their fees and budget their usage around any such attack, so if the attacker wants to stay disruptive, they've got to raise their fees and thus their costs. High value Bitcoin transactions may be willing to pay considerable fees, so to effectively DoS all of them would be very costly indeed.

Then they could be only partially douchey in the future by trying to squeeze the old "free forever" customers off the service as newer features become available only to new plan customers -- a la cell phone providers and their unlimited plans. I guess there's just too much pressure to make up for the social engineering loss.

Just because Bitcoin development is finally taking small steps towards decentralization does not mean any one implementation has the right to consider itself under attack (except perhaps, when it's released implementations and supporting mining pools are under concerted attack).

In case you didn't just mean brick-and-mortar or local services, off the top of my head the largest companies that accept bitcoin online include Microsoft, Dish Network, Dell, Overstock, Newegg, TigerDirect, Expedia (for some - most? - hotel bookings only), and Rakuten.com.  
Unfortunately, since this space changes so quickly, it's difficult to find a complete, curated, and up-to-date list. In particular, many of the listings on [Coinmap]( may no longer accept bitcoin, or may only accepted it during limited hours (when the person that knows about Bitcoin is around). I'd always call ahead to verify.  
The major merchant service providers Coinbase and BitPay list their featured partners:  
  
  
and this article from Coinbase seems well researched and fairly recent:  
  
Other services that I could find seem to offer less accuracy. This article from Nasdaq:  
  
includes Tesla, which I don't believe is accurate. *A single Tesla* was sold for bitcoin from a particular dealership, but I don't believe the Tesla company directly accepts bitcoin.  
In case you're in the UK, this list seems to be pretty decent: 
  
This site seems to have some good resources, but may not be complete or accurate:  
  
And this list clearly contains errors, but is relatively extensive (the errors seem to be companies that you can purchase gift cards for through companies like [Gyft]( [eGifter]( or [CardFlip]( or are companies you can purchase from using indirect Bitcoin services like [Purse.io]( and [Brawker](

I hear that argument a lot. But it's not about, "well, I don't need that capability", it's about realizing this is an open system that provides options that weren't formerly available and figuring out a way to capitalize on it.

So your conclusion is Bitcoin can be interfered with by people or organizations with tons of money, power and bad intent. Is there any system that this is not true of?  
Bitcoin's design principles ensure that relatively little can be accomplished through attacks particularly relative to the vast effort needed to make them. The community is also quite capable of responding should attacks emerge, and the protocol ensures that attacks always become obvious.  
In addition, such attacks can only cause greater impact when they are conducted for longer continuous periods, but the larger and more resourced an attack is, the sooner it makes itself obvious.

Ah, and hence my confusion. The problem is hard forks are not preventable. If a proposed system like yours can be agreed upon, usable, and ready in time before the community chooses to embrace a hard fork option that'd be one thing. Even then, the community would need to collectively support this "non-hard fork option" on a pros and cons basis against any other choices. Then perhaps a hard fork would be *temporarily* avoided. But just assessing the situation based on complexity, and as yet incomplete development, I'm quite skeptical that will occur.

As with most things Bitcoin, they're both safe *when used properly*. There have been incidents of user error which caused scares if not losses. One in particular involved a user that confused the URL for an encrypted and an unencrypted RushWallet, and sent funds to the wrong one. This initially sounded like it may have been a problem with RushWallet's implementation, but it was just user error in the end. I believe funds were eventually recovered in that incident.  
Usefully, RushWallet is one of the only wallet implementations that allows spending of unconfirmed inputs. Of course, the subsequent transaction will never get into a block until the inputs confirm first (or at least are in the same block). Still, it's useful when you don't want to wait to broadcast the next transaction.

Seconded. And I do agree with your summary as well.  
Nice post on the block chain based on credit. I appreciate that you didn't gloss over potential pitfalls. For all those parties that keep praising block chain technology but try to separate it from an inherent token like bitcoin, what you put forward may be a workable template. I'm still skeptical that such a system will work out favorably in a Pros-and-Cons analysis (for one thing, it seems to introduce too much that can go wrong from a [KISS]( perspective), but it will be interesting to see what if anything emerges.
@_date: 2015-04-05 14:44:55
Bitcoin is in its infancy. 25 new units are still being created about every ten minutes. In this launch phase the supply of currency is still being bootstrapped. It'll probably be another five or ten years (minimum) before bitcoin exhibits some semblance of stability or begins to complete its price discovery.
As Bitcoin reaches that maturity, the early history of nearly exponential exchange rate growth clearly will not continue and the era of $10 million pizzas will be long past.  
From your comment, it seems you're trying to imagine using Bitcoin as a currency right now, while it's still exhibiting its youthful growth characteristics. I agree that widespread adoption for that purpose would not work at this stage. But as a mature currency, Bitcoin may prove to be the best choice available.
@_date: 2015-04-05 23:33:58
This is exactly true, but most speculate that the rate of loss will form some sort of relationship with the market capitalization of the currency. So the higher the overall value, the lower the rate of loss. Since Bitcoin can be made infinitely divisible (when necessary, zeros can be added after the decimal point), this low, steady and predictable rate of loss should not present a problem.
@_date: 2015-09-04 05:24:42
I follow your point, but I think those in positions of authority (most placed their with at least some community input) have a greater responsibility to be civil and rational, making it far more reprehensible when they're the ones devolving into shit-slinging antics.

Even among nodes, I don't know that anyone can be certain at this point that XT will achieve a majority, but it's out there as an option now. It's a large block implementation that *actually exists*. Of course, it's early days still and nothing is a done deal right now, so ringing it's death knell due to low current hash rate is, in my opinion, quite premature.
@_date: 2015-09-04 01:48:04
Rather than infeasibility, I suspect the real reason was convenience. Full node wallets can be cumbersome in several ways: if not running all of the time they need to "catch up" the next time they're used, if not shut down properly database corruption often requires a re-index or re-sync, they can't be easily transferred computer to computer, and restoring from backup on a new install takes considerable time. However, none of this means the user was unable to use a full node wallet, just that they found an alternative that suited their needs better.

I believe this is essentially the system the exists right now with Bitcoin, and I think the fact that everyone is free to implement a hard fork at any time is a critical aspect of this.  
Regarding the rest of your post, I don't think I'm following most of it, specifically in the context of our previous short exchange. I do get that you currently support Adam Back's 4 year limit raising proposal. Although I still prefer BIP 101, I think that would be an excellent option to have available once the code arrives.

Thanks for providing a link, but that's hardly what I would consider a source for the claim that raising the block size *limit* will definitely result in reduced decentralization. Instead, it's just more speculative arguments, albeit more carefully documented and organized.  
A prime actual source would be a quality paper (peer-reviewed academic in the best case) that reaches the aforementioned conclusions based on modeling, research, simulation, and/or very careful consideration of *all* relevant factors (or at least as many as foreseeable). Failing that, at least a post with one or more elements from the following (likely incomplete) list:  
* That is based on past observed evidence  
* That includes consideration of as many contributing factors as possible (to wit, most pro-small block analysis are clearly flawed as they assume some or all of the following: that raising the block size limit will result in larger blocks right now; that larger blocks will exist with technology essentially equivalent to the current level of computing power, storage, and networking capability; alternatively, that any future increases in technological capability will definitely be exceeded by block size growth resulting from the raised limit; that increased orphan rate of larger blocks will not significantly disincentivize miners from using them; that miners who observe competitors actively using large block sizes to their own advantage (such as by generating and adding their own transactions to inflate block sizes) will not take action against the abusers thus resulting in even higher orphan rates for the perpetrators; that miners in general will always engage in actions which result in increased short-term profit without any consideration of longer term effects such as rebellion of pool participants, community backlash, increased market uncertainty likely resulting in lower valuations; disruption and controversy detrimentally affecting the growth of Bitcoin as a whole; and the possibility of causing enough anger among Bitcoin users that the nuclear option of forking to a new hashing algorithm is invoked.)  
* That can explain the failure of GHash.io achieving greater or complete mining centralization when they clearly offered higher profitability than their competitors, while still proving that raising the block size limit will surely result in the opposite.  
In fact, while I've seen many argue speculatively that larger block size limits as small as 2 or 4 MB will definitely result in centralization, I've yet to see anyone provide a cogent and convincing source indicating that even *a complete removal of the block size limit* would, of a certainty or even with high probability, lead to the same result.
@_date: 2015-09-02 11:23:40
That's exactly not what I mean by "decentralized action". I mean taking the first real steps towards not having the development for a cryptocurrency protocol centralized in a single repository, because Bitcoin is, well, decentralized (and open source).  


FTFY. It doesn't matter the motivation or criteria for a Bitcoin participant's choice. It's the fact that they can choose to go with another option/repository that makes it truly decentralized.

I was replying to your statement that some devs feel miners should not vote to choose when to implement a hard fork, which I took to be referring to BIP 101's requirements of being after a specific date and after at least 750 of the last 1,000 most recently mined blocks support BIP 101 before the grace period for the fork begins. I'm generally aware of BIP 103, but I haven't heard whether it uses a different set of criteria to trigger the actual BIP 103 hard fork.  
I would expect such details to be listed explicitly wherever BIP 103 executables are available for download, as they are for every other client implementation. I've asked where such downloads can be had, but I'm not aware of having received a response. If no executables are yet on offer, then BIP 103 is not available as an implementation in the same way as the current version of Core, XT, btcsuite, etc.  
That would definitely represent a dichotomy, but there'd be nothing false about it.

Certainly, and they're free to implement a better solution if they have one. Personally, larger miners strike me as risk-averse and resistant to change, making them liable to follow the consensus choice of users and ecosystem companies. But that consensus choice will be unlikely to coalesce if fully developed options are not put before the community. Events may now be overtaking the supporters of non-BIP 101 proposals. If they continue to delay offering implementable solutions, users and ecosystem companies will be left to choose between doing nothing or using the only existing implementation available to them.

That's encouraging, but I'll still be shocked if completed LN *with* decentralized routing is available in less than an unknown number of years. Potential routing schemes have not even been presented to the community for review yet. Whenever that does actually happen, it'll only be the *starting point* of discussion and consideration of possible alternative implementations. So far, the base LN concept seems to be relatively free of dissension, but decentralized routing may not find the sailing as smooth. Add the fact that implementation of any routing scheme would require a detailed understanding of how base LN will actually work in the wild, and the expectation that it can all be crammed in under a year strains credulity.

If you are stretching your efforts out over three years in a market that changes as quickly as Bitcoin you'd find that your efforts at market manipulation would be self-defeating. Still, you are missing my point. I'm not saying manipulation comes from regulation. I'm saying that in regulated markets specific actions by market participants may run afoul of rules or conventions and hence be regarded as manipulation. However, Bitcoin exchanges are entirely unregulated. Any market action by any participant is fair game. Looked at another way, those participating in Bitcoin markets should simply *assume* manipulation.  
So to answer your original question:  


It doesn't. All activity on Bitcoin markets is normal activity. Call it manipulation if you want to, but there's nothing in place in the markets to avoid it or stop it.

A hard fork that changes something as basic as how private keys are structured and/or how they sign transactions would mean that there must be a migration path for any existing Bitcoin holders to upgrade.

Perhaps I was inexact. I should have said that every satoshi *can develop* a unique history, and thus become uniquely identifiable by its transaction history. Of course, a large group of satoshis that have exactly the same transaction history would be indistinguishable until or unless some are separated in a future transaction. But I think this detail is irrelevant when considering how to track the source of funds.  
To be honest, I have not delved into all the different ways a colored coin system might be implemented, but the fact that it can be accomplished means that base units must be distinguishable at some level.

I think the real answer is either "it varies" or "it hasn't been determined yet" depending on the nations, jurisdictions, or even regulatory agencies in question. As others have mentioned, you can argue that bitcoins themselves are always on the global block chain. You're only ever transporting private keys, or indexes/references/access credentials for private keys. So the bitcoins themselves never move just because you're traveling.
@_date: 2015-03-21 15:27:54


I don't think this is possible with Bitcoin, since there is no way to force everyone to comply to a centralized authority or to get everyone to agree to such a set of rules.  


The permanent complete transaction record in the block chain likely sets an upper limit to the *actual* fungibility that can be achieved natively, but I agree that society can try to enforce de facto fungibility by mandating coin history be ignored. Likewise, if not mandated, the community can agree to promote certain behavior, but I'm skeptical that a high rate of compliance can be achieved.
@_date: 2015-03-29 05:38:02
With regards to liquidating quickly, in the US you're best bet is probably to get in touch with [SecondMarket]( ahead of time to prepare for the transaction. If speedy access to the fiat funds is required, you may also need to bring in a banker from your receiving bank. He/she should be able to minimize any delay upon receiving a domestic wire transfer from SecondMarket. The price would likely need to be negotiated for the bulk sale and may not reflect exchange market price. I'm also not familiar with their fee structure.  
The regular withdrawal limits and ACH transfers at [Coinbase]( [Circle]( and [Celery]( are likely too slow and limiting for this use case. I use my Coinbase account most, and only have a $50,000 daily withdrawal limit (this includes withdrawals from Coinbase Exchange). I haven't used my Circle or Celery accounts nearly as much, but the limits for those accounts is far lower and applied *weekly*. ACH would then introduce delays of 2 to 4 business days, followed by possibly more delay at your receiving bank. All three companies state their limits are based on usage history, and they all invite you to contact them with requests to raise limits.  
It couldn't hurt to contact Coinbase, Circle and/or Celery directly to see if any of them is willing to arrange for your needs as a special case. They'd likely need to agree to a domestic wire transfer (with a fee, of course) to send larger amounts with any speed, but if you can get one of them to go along, they may be more willing to do the transaction at close to exchange pricing. You may also be among the first to try this, so your case could be worth some PR to the company that gets your business.  
A final option may be to send the bitcoin from the sale to a foreign exchange like [Bitfinex]( or [Bitstamp]( liquidate them on the market and send an international wire transfer to your receiving bank. I think this option is riskier as it involves companies in sketchier foreign jurisdictions, uses exchanges that may not be as solid (Bitstamp was recently hacked, and Bitfinex runs on an (updated?) Bitcoinica platform), and may complicate the tax situation.

Looked at another way, I see everything you're writing about as the actions and behavior of the community that is simply taking and using Bitcoin as it is, imperfect fungibility and all.  


If BTC-e's actions are illegal or unprofessional, I hope they're held accountable. But I don't think it should be the responsibility of *any* outside party to make Bitcoin more fungible than it inherently is.  
If a user desires greater privacy, they're free to try coin mixing or any other such technique. But as a community, can we expect *all* Bitcoin users to act *only* in ways that enhance fungibility? I think that's unrealistic and impinges upon the freedom for everyone to use Bitcoin as they see fit.
@_date: 2015-03-01 03:27:38
My understanding is that once you are fully verified on Coinbase, Circle, or Celery, you can buy up to your allowed limit at whatever the price is when you place your buy order *without* cash on deposit. It just won't be an instant buy, and if there's any problem with the ACH transfer, the buy will be cancelled.

Obsessing about the costs and efficiency of mining completely misses the point. No one holds a gun to the heads of miners. They mine by choice. One elegant characteristic of Bitcoin is that the hashing work done by miners directly relates to the security of Bitcoin, which in turn is directly related to the value of the network as characterized by the price of bitcoin. If people find the network useful and the value of bitcoin goes up, so does the mining incentive, causing more miners to mine and increasing the network's overall security. If the network is less used, the value of a bitcoin goes down, bringing the mining incentive with it and overall security is reduced. This is fine, though, because there is less value in the network to secure in this scenario. The self-adjusting difficulty ensures that mining will always be economically profitable for some segment of the population, regardless of the price of bitcoin.  
So the work expended by miners is largely irrelevant to users who choose not to mine. The majority of Bitcoin users can be completely unaware of mining details, and yet transaction costs remain low and the system just works.
Further, as correctly points out, a proper cost benefit analysis of Bitcoin is completely one-sided unless you consider the energy, workforce and infrastructure requirements of the conventional industries that Bitcoin has the potential to replace.

I think where we're disagreeing is on what is considered an attack on Bitcoin's fungibility. I contend BTC-e, as a private entity can choose to transact or freeze any particular coins that they control, just like any other Bitcoin user can. I don't see such behavior as decreasing Bitcoin's fungibility overall, as all Bitcoin users have always been free to practice such behavior — it shouldn't be seen as a new development. If someone tries to pay with cash that is clearly known to be stolen, everyone should be free to decline the transaction. Cash as a whole would still be as fungible as it always was, but the behavior in such an instance is simply freedom of choice.

EDIT 2: pointed out I overstated the case — I clarified my position in a later comment. I should also add that after truly effective tumbling, you could end up with an amount composed of entirely different satoshis. This would get pretty close to being as good as the re-melted gold example, but you'd still need to worry about whether the tumbling service is compromised by a three-letter agency or whether they keep logs that could get seized. And after such a successful tumble, other users of the service would get some fraction of your tainted coins, and they could potentially be tracked back to the service itself.

Bitcoin could, but disadvantages likely outweigh dubious potential benefits. You'd increase block chain bloat and the rate at which orphans occur, and yet the system would still not be reliably fast enough for retail if you insist on waiting for at least one confirmation. Using 10 second blocks, you still infrequently get long block times which could have you waiting two to three minutes to get the next block, and your transaction may not even be included! Proposals for systems that enable fast, trusted transactions on top of Bitcoin seem to hold more promise, and for now zero-conf transactions are working just fine.  
EDIT: I forgot to mention that the confidence achieved with one confirmation at 10 second blocks is also lower than a single confirmation with 10 minute blocks due to higher chance of orphans. Therefore, if you need a similar level of confidence, you'd be forced to wait for more than one confirmation anyway.

Peter Todd is knowledgeable and makes some good points. Still, I think it's clear that his perspective is sometimes skewed at best. If the methods you mention are truly free, why don't you find a few hundred out of your 5,000 people who are actively against Bitcoin and organize an effort *to actually bring it down?* I for one would love such an effort, as it would assist in hardening Bitcoin in the long run. Otherwise, your claim is just vapor.

Ah, I see what you mean. So the "coloring" in such a scheme actually might acutally move around from satoshi to satoshi through a transaction, as long as the total amount of color coins is constant and correct ownership records are maintained. Thanks for the detailed explanation.  
Still, if the elements comprising any Bitcoin amount have transaction histories distinguishable from others, this is something that can be keyed upon for tracking. If any "tainted" portion remains after tumbling, however small, this can be determined with enough effort. I suppose in the best case, after tumbling the result could be composed of completely different elements, but this just means other users of the service received some tainted coins, and they could be potentially tracked back to the mixing service (for any good that might do).  
Defeating Bitcoin's fungibility may require a lot of work, but to date, I'm not sure it can be made fully impossible.

Personally, I go out of my way to pay with bitcoin even if it's a little inconvenient or if it costs marginally more. I think increased usage helps Bitcoin's velocity of money thereby increasing awareness and adoption.

I see where you're coming from. Yes, this is actually pretty early in the development of Electrum's offline signing capability. So  you're really just using two copies of the same client software in different capacities.

If you're new to Bitcoin you've done a fair bit of work just getting the set up functioning. Kudos to you.

Very kind of you, thanks! And I'm glad you got it working. One thing I thought I'd mention: in your case I don't think the offline wallet can really be considered like 2-2 multisig, since only one private key is involved. What it *does* do is make certain the private key in any transaction is never exposed to the Internet. Only the signature by the key is released to the wild, but it's still only one key doing the signing per transaction.

Don't like the hierarchical structure that most Bitcoin developers choose to work within? Simple: just copy all/any of the code off of Github and start working on it however you like. No one — not Gavin, not Satoshi — can stop you from doing anything you like to your copy of the code. And once you're through, as long as you can convince some number of Bitcoin users to use your code, you will have managed to create a fork. Of course, the utility of your fork will depend directly on the quality of your code changes and the proportion of Bitcoin users that choose to adopt your code.

I'm familiar with that thread and other Blockstream staff community interactions. As a whole, they do not demonstrate the understanding that their company ties preclude them from appearing to act objectively. They need to step back and interact with the community with a light touch if at all. Prefacing all of their communications with boiler plate explanations of who they are, what their company goals are, and how that could color perception of any subsequent discussion would go a long ways towards full transparency and winning the community's trust.  
On the contrary, their past interactions have been heavy-handed, tone-deaf, and too easily interpreted as being wholly self-serving. Many of Adam Back's submissions have been downright cringeworthy.

From what I understand, Lightning Network when completed in either hub-and-spoke or truly decentralized form, should be a useful extension layer on top of Bitcoin. However, the entire premise of this article seems flawed to me for the simple reason that Lightning Network does not yet exist in a finalized form (not even in beta). Even Lightning developers can't assert with absolute certainty what the final attributes of the production product will be, so how can any outside observer know what will actually be fact or myth?  
The best that can be determined now is project intent, and even that seems to have migrated from initially being available via a hub-and-spoke model to now including decentralized routing as an integral (?) part of LN. Who can say if project intent will migrate further before a finished product is delivered?

Did you check first to see if the initial transaction was still visible via a few block explorers? If it wasn't after you waited the couple of days, your second attempt wasn't even a double-spend. The first transaction just failed to be included in a block and started disappearing from miners' mempools, and your wallet client apparently did not re-send the original transaction. To the Bitcoin network, it would just be like your first transaction attempt faded away.

Use a wallet where you fully control the private keys to ensure timely send transactions.

Miners and non-mining nodes both have control over network consensus.

You can call it victim-blaming if you want and I'm not defending or condoning BTC-e's actions, but we are talking about Bitcoin-related services. Users should be aware when they might be playing in traffic. I haven't used BTC-e, but my cursory Googling did turn up issues (e.g. mysterious location, unknown owners/management, reports of unprofessional support, occasional delays in withdrawals or the crediting of deposits, possible associations with Russian organized crime, etc.) that gave me pause. To the credit of this subreddit's community, these issues seem to be brought up just about every time BTC-e is mentioned. If an exchange pulls something that's unprofessional, I'm least surprised if it's BTC-e, but in this case I think not facilitating the exit or mixing of stolen Evolution funds is exactly the right thing to do. The *way in which* BTC-e went about it is of course another matter.  
BTC-e is one of the longest running Bitcoin exchanges, but among it's major competitors it's best positioned by far to get away with pulling an Evolution-style exit scam. Knock on wood, here's hoping it never happens.

Since you're new, this'll probably go over your head, but the Bitcoin network has been getting flooded with malleated transactions causing some wallets to misreport balances. This is a problem with the wallets, not Bitcoin itself, and can't in general cause the loss of funds. Most likely your balance is what you think it is and it'll sort itself out in time. If you want more information, post what wallet you are using and/or Transaction IDs, and you're sure to get responses.

@_date: 2015-03-23 20:12:16
Here's a list someone is compiling and updating (though I haven't fully reviewed it for completeness, it does seem to list most main points):  
  
As someone who has used Bitcoin in the past, I'm surprised you are *just now* developing doubts about it. You understand that Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and that commercial development is only starting to pick up steam, right? Venture capital investment in 2014 totaled about $500 million USD, and for 2015 it's on track to be around $1 billion USD. The fruits of these investments may not start to appear for another year or two at least. Major financial organizations such as [MasterCard]( and [Credit-Suisse]( (among many others) are starting to take serious notice. Regarding being an acronym on NASDAQ, one entity, the [Bitcoin Investment Trust (symbol GBTC)]( is already listed (though not on NASDAQ) and is poised to start trading OTC any day now. Several others should be following on soon.  
Recently, it's become quite trendy in business and the media to praise the block chain, the technology pioneered by Bitcoin and that underpins it, while dismissing bitcoin as a currency. The proof-of-work backed block chain is truly a revolutionary innovation that represents the first time in history a consensus can be achieved across a fully open network where no trust must be vested in any network member. However, the position that you can embrace the block chain as a platform for innovation and dismiss the value token that is inherent in its function is a fallacy based on either a basic misunderstanding of Bitcoin's core technology, or on the presumption that some dramatically superior system is just around the corner (which hypothetically would not require a value token at all). The problem is while such an upcoming development cannot be said to be impossible, its emergence hardly seems imminent. In addition, should any such developments arise, Bitcoin is software that can adopt innovations into its protocol. As its existing network already stands as the largest, most secure, and most highly capitalized digital currency by far, keeping up with obviously beneficial changes will be strongly motivated by those already supporting or invested in Bitcoin.
The final thing I'll bring up might be the first thing most in the general public notice about Bitcoin: do you still own any of the coins you bought at $1 or $20? If so, their current value would seem to be a good recommendation on Bitcoin as an investment (and if not, I'm sure you're kicking yourself a bit on what you missed out on so far). If Bitcoin grows and succeeds, it's valuation should continuing increasing the way it has for most of its short six-year life for some time to come (in overall direction at least, if not in the explosiveness of its past, virtually exponential growth). There are so many areas in which Bitcoin shows potential that I feel if it achieves even a small fraction of its promise in just some of these areas its valuation has tremendous room for growth. It must be acknowledged that the price has fallen severely over the last 15 months after the most recent spike, but this doesn't even represent its sharpest decline nor the longest down period of its six-year existence. There still has never been a time span during which you could buy bitcoin at the worst possible moment and *lose* value if you held for more than 19 months. Still, since its entire history is so short, this is hardly a guarantee these trends will continue (and past history never assures future returns). But just maybe the current valuation represents a good buying opportunity (disclaimer: bitcoin must be a considered a high risk investment). Be aware, also, that I suspect it's volatile and spiky valuation patterns will continue for some time as well. If precipitous drops after huge price spikes make you nauseous, be prepared to lock your valuation (via services like Coinapult Locks or Bitreserve), utilize short positions, or exit Bitcoin temporarily if another steep run up occurs. Timing could be tricky, though, and the old Bitcoin "HODL" strategy may prove more foolproof in the long run (or at least until Bitcoin matures, after which volatility and explosive growth will likely no longer be the considerations they are now).
@_date: 2015-03-02 03:31:41
I've got to credit you on the research front, but that is a truly obscure reach. On the [same article page]( just above, only the following definitions are given:  




* State-issued money which is neither convertible by law to any other thing, nor fixed in value in terms of any objective standard.[6]
* Intrinsically valueless money used as money because of government decree.[2]  
Your reference is not listed as a definition, but under "Treatment in Economics" and has but a single published reference. Hardly common usage, and I'm sure, well disputed by other academics and linguists. You're welcome to keep digging if you like, but until you get a broad cross section of the English speaking populace to adopt your "treatment", it's not going to be listed as a definition any time soon.
@_date: 2015-03-04 11:11:01
Right, it doesn't solve the problem in and of itself. It just *can* serve as a red flag that something's not right. At that point, it would probably come down to the developer posting a PGP signed message indicating where the problem is (assuming his PGP public key was published somewhere trustworthy and had previously been agreed upon by the community). Or if the developer is somehow MIA, it's time for code auditing.

I'm not sure this is so, since any competitors taking this course of action risk discovery and the consequences that would bring.  


There'll always be those that just want to watch the world burn, but even the kiddies must expend bitcoin and effort (since not all attempts succeed), while leaving a real-world evidence trail. Currently legal repercussions might not be too much of a disincentive, but even that's starting to change pretty fast as jurisdictions develop policies regarding cryptos.

The answer to that is "it depends". Coinbase has a few products, their regular hot wallet, the ability to exchange bitcoins with USD, and a product called Multisig Vault. So if you use their hot wallet *with* their Multisig Vault, you're probably getting close to the same security as with GreenAddress. If you only use Coinbase's hot wallet, GreenAddress is pretty clearly superior. One of GreenAddress' advantages over Coinbase's regular hot wallet is you fully control your own funds at all times. So even if the wallet provider is wiped off the face of the planet, you'll still be able to recover your funds (provided you back up your keys when you set up your wallet). If you only use Coinbase's hot wallet, they're basically functioning as a Bitcoin bank for you. If they have technical problems, if the government asks them too, or if they implode, your funds can be frozen or disappear (they may be offering insurance now, though, I'm not 100% clear on that). Coinbase Multisig Vault reportedly gives you full access to your funds and multisig advantages, but I've yet to use it so I don't know the full details. I wonder why Coinbase wouldn't just merge all the good features of Multisig Vaults into *all* of their wallets. The other advantage of multisig is you have to provide authorization from (at least) two independent devices before a send can be made. This is sort of like a better version of two-factor authorization (2FA). I don't know the details of GreenAddress' implementation of multisig, but I believe it offers all of the advantages I mentioned.  
Regarding storage of your info by a central network, both services will collect whatever information they require, but Coinbase will likely need more, especially if you buy bitcoins through them, since they're then required to satisfy government KYC and AML regulations.
Finally, I should add that I've seen several reports (though the actual incidence of the problem for any one user is probably rare) that when you send from Coinbase to a non-Coinbase Bitcoin address (i.e. an external address), the send is sometimes delayed. This delay is often so lengthy that the time period a Bitcoin payment service gives you to pay (usually 10 or 15 minutes) might expire, causing purchases to fail (I've also seen some reports of this problem for Circle). Bitcoin wallets that give you full control over your own funds never have this problem.

To be fair, **if** Blockchain.info's systems are working and you backup your wallet, you technically control your own keys. But the advice to switch to another wallet is good because of BC.i's recent history of comically poor performance and weak code security.  
If you like the web wallet concept, some better regarded ones include [GreenAddress]( [Coinkite]( [BlockTrail]( and [Copay]( (although Copay is only sort of a web wallet). With proper multisig and 2FA configuration, these wallets are in some ways more secure than a wallet client running entirely on your own computer (excluding local wallets used in conjunction with a hardware wallet - these combinations are generally highly secure).

Unless you're already using two-factor authentication (2FA) at the gambling website, you may as well just move the coins to a wallet where you control the private keys as a first step. I'd suggest [Electrum]( or [Copay]( Then look into a true cold storage solution. A hardware wallet like a [Trezor]( is a good choice, but you could also spend the time to learn how to properly use cold paper wallets, or offline signing wallets like Bitcoin Core/XT, Armory or Electrum (note: offline signing requires advanced use, it's not just installing one of the aforementioned in normal "hot wallet" configuration).

I don't know if I'd go as far as calling Ripple a scam, but to me it's definitely got many more compromises than Bitcoin. I'm also not a fan of the huge pre-mine nor the way the central body (Ripple Labs) controlling it has been run. I think it's telling that one of the key core developers got disillusioned and forked Stellar. Perhaps they can get everything working such that it's an improvement over some legacy systems, but it'll never exhibit the level of decentralization or trustlessness seen in Bitcoin.  
EDIT: One definite advantage for Ripple Labs is their budget for PR and advertising, which probably is key in generating the mentions in the press that we do see.

What exactly is the pipe dream? This is exactly how the system works. The community rewards work believed to have merit with a consensus of adoption. It's quite elegant in my opinion. Should anyone produce code that is preferred, community adoption will follow.

Only work product not seen as beneficial to Bitcoin would struggle to convince users to convert, and I believe that's just as it should be.

People that own bitcoins would love for someone to try to corner the market. I saw elsewhere in this thread that you said to suppose you had $100 million. I could suppose you had $10 billion. Bitcoin's scarcity and illiquidity is its ultimate defense. If you tried to buy 20% of all bitcoins right now, the price would skyrocket in the process. If you tried to corner the market on bitcoins with $10 billion, I think you'd rapidly find that what you may have thought was enough to buy 100% of all bitcoins would not be enough to buy 50% or less.

* Yes, you need bitcoin to open a channel.  
* Any existing wallet could incorporate LN, but new coding is required.  
* This is the big question. As originally presented, access to LN for most users would've been under a hub-and-spoke model. Hubs in such a model would've been largely responsible for routing. Now talk has shifted to a decentralized routing model, and this just posted today:   
I'm not sure if this would be a complete decentralized solution including URIs or DNS-like capability, though.  
* I believe this will hinge on which routing system becomes most popular, and how it handles privacy.  
* No, LN transactions are effectively instant, and *mostly* trustless (funds can get tied up for predetermined periods of time).

It depends on how long you run your node compared to how long it's not running. If you run it an hour a week, then it's likely not supporting the network at all. If you run it eight hours a day, then it'll spend a significant amount of time when you start it each day to catch up on the 16 hours it has missed. During this catching up period, it's actually placing a strain on the network rather than contributing to it. I think running it eight hours a day would probably work out to contributing to the network, but I don't really know the exact crossover point at which it'll definitely be a net contributor (this likely depends on your Internet speed and the speed of the computing platform as well).  
I don't know how running a node behind a VPN is a vector for attack, and I'd be interested if someone could explain this as well.

More blanket inaccuracy. What you mean is *altcoins* can be created at will. What can't be created at will is Bitcoin's network of *users* and thus its inherent strength.  


You've been around here for a long time. Are you telling me you still do not understand how the protocol is implemented by consensus?  


Citation please? There are large mining concerns in China, but all of them put together are not "more than half", and most hash power even in China is in *pools*. If any pool were to attack Bitcoin it ensures its rapid disintegration.  
Thanks for all of the foregoing, but let me repeat my original question:  


@_date: 2015-03-21 12:07:49
The real world already shows that money does not need to be fully fungible to work. Only the cash an average person holds is roughly fungible (they do still have serial numbers after all), the numbers in his/her bank accounts are not. Any control or locking being exhibited here is occurring at a private, centralized exchange. If it's a concern, avoid using such services. If Bitcoin continues to grow, the importance of such exchanges will diminish as well.

Completely agree. Bitcoin is an excellent and flexible tool, but there's no guarantee it will be the best solution for any particular use-case. This doesn't preclude new innovation changing these considerations on an ongoing basis.  
The GreenAddress instant payment method you mention sounds very workable. I believe there are also other competing methodologies. It'll come down to adoption, service provider, maturity, and vastly improved access and user experience for the customer; areas that I'm sure are all actively getting worked on.  
I also agree that the concerns for zeroconf transactions only arise when goods change hands immediately, primarily in-person sales. I hope online zeroconf statistics are not getting used as evidence for their feasibility as those are clearly not representative of true fraud risk. Major merchant service providers such as Bitpay and Coinbase may understandably feel a need to avoid discussing double-spending losses, and that makes it hard to get true visibility of the problem.  
If nothing else, though, market forces will be the final arbiter of the situation now and in the future. If the most widely used method of zeroconf Bitcoin transaction remains more economical than competing services (such as legacy card services and their associated fraud loss considerations), they will likely continue to be used regardless of their recognizable susceptibility to double-spends. At current extremely low usage levels, we likely will not know how this will play out for some time. Hopefully the refinement of methods such as the GreenAddress option you presented will render the issue moot by the time there is significant brick-and-mortar sales volume.

There is no agreement within the community as to the definition of consensus or rough consensus, so presenting this as a finish line is projecting a mirage.  


This is your opinion and contention. Others feel BIP 101 is tested, ready, and it has indisputably been released to the public for use. Whether the community agrees with your assessment or not will be determined in the near future. And that future may be much more near than many think.

Thank you for the detailed reply, very clearly explained. Someone else, it may have been Mike, mentioned the proposal to give miners double-spends. The burn proposal sounds similar. I didn't realize such implementations would be affected by transaction malleability. Perhaps if/when that's corrected, these proposals will be re-examined.  
Your points about the basic insecurity of zero-conf and that miner behavior cannot be controlled are well taken. I just don't know that because the worst *can* happen, that it absolutely will happen. I suppose that anyone depending on zero-conf will just need to be alert and nimble in event of changing conditions.  
If all else fails, in-person retail Bitcoin use could be relegated to going through a "credit card"-like centralized service. Hardly the best situation, but something that could always serve as a fallback position.

Although cold storage like using a Trezor is the most secure form of storage, it does not mean other methods cannot be safe. Most wallet security depends on the digital security of the device.

Just a minor clarification: I think meant that the Bitcoin protocol won't allow you to send to addresses that aren't properly formed Bitcoin addresses, so Litecoin or Whatever-coin addresses wouldn't qualify. And you also don't really need to worry about typos, since Bitcoin addresses use a built-in checksum making it very unlikely that a typo would result in a properly formed address. You *can* of course send to a wrong correctly-formed Bitcoin address (not the one of your intended recipient), so you need to take care. This is akin to the problem during the early days of the Internet when you only had IP addresses like 216.0.37.145 instead of a URLs like google.com. It would be easy to mix up two IP addresses if you're not certain which parties they are associated with, and the same is true of legit Bitcoin addresses. Various parties are working on potential solutions (e.g. onename.com).

Thanks for the link, interesting stuff. Seems to be based on hardware biases (clock skews). So timing likely does get obscured or re-written by passing through active switching nodes, but I didn't know that many (all?) packets contain their own time stamp! So this allows you to always derive *some* information based on the relative information from when a packet is received in its data stream compared to its internal time stamp.  
Since clock skews are an inherent characteristic of hardware, it might be difficult to exploit this to transmit data. Definitely useful for identification though. Just another tool in the NSA's toolbox, I guess.  
Thinking of countermeasures, I wonder if there's a way to randomize clock skews, or to randomize the time stamps in outgoing packets by a small amount so that they're still useful for their intended purposes but are of no use for fingerprinting?

The only thing about game tokens is that they are nearly always fully centralized, so they don't compare to decentralized cryptos. However, complete centralization is actually what a central bank wants. That being the case, the bank may as well throw away the block chain also, because if decentralization is not your goal it only adds inefficiency. And this is what confuses me: if you are central bank that needs policy control, why pursue or promote a decentralized architecture like the block chain? You *might* be able to cobble together complex mechanisms to incentivize miner behavior that roughly conforms to your policies (effectively rendering the network of miners centralized), but then there few advantages left over a conventional system architecture. What I think central banks really want is a digital currency based on a conventional database (perhaps with high redundancy and hardened against DDoS) that is *standardized* nationwide or even globally.  
You mentioned a good point: in the past, the central bank was the only game in town. Once they set policy, nearly everyone in the economy was stuck with those rules (precious metals were pretty much the only out, and they weren't/aren't viable as digital currencies). Now, you've got Bitcoin and everything else. If a central bank tries to dictate a system that is the smallest bit restrictive or onerous in its use, it's now far too easy to switch to a less encumbered alternative. In a very fundamental way, central bank power has already been significantly eroded.

I don't think those on the original block chain would wait because a fast hard fork could solve two problems: it could switch to a new mining algorithm immune to manipulation from new chain miners, *and* it would reset difficulty. Normally any remaining SHA256 miners on the original chain would object, but in this scenario they wouldn't have a leg to stand on since staying with SHA256 would keep all original chain users vulnerable to the dominant hashing power of the new chain miners.

Bitcoin mining has become extremely competitive on an industrial scale. It's very unlikely that a hobbyist miner will be able to turn a profit even with free electricity.

Thanks for considering my hypothesis. I think the whole thing hinges on what changes occur in the hard fork, and how those changes affect the acceptance or rejection of transactions on the two block chains. NewBitcoin transactions will be accepted by NewBitcoin nodes and get mined by NewBitcoin miners into the new block chain. The same is true of OriginalBitcoin transactions and the original block chain. The uncertainty comes in when we ask what NewBitcoin nodes will do when they receive a OriginalBitcoin transaction and vice versa. As far as I can tell, if you stay with a single fork, everything will work fine. It's only if you try to spend some coins that were already spent on one fork on the other fork that uncertainty comes in. If all the nodes on the other fork rejected the transactions that spent the coins on the first fork, when you load the private keys up into a client running code for the other fork, then spend them, I believe the transaction should work fine. If, on the other hand, the nodes of the other fork did accept the previous transactions that were intended for the first fork, those coins will have already been spent when you try to spend them for the second time. But I think whether the nodes of the other fork reject the transaction(s) from the first fork or not depends on exactly what the changes are in the hard fork and how they are implemented in the code.

If it's the same way Bitcoin does it, there can't be any central bank control. As soon as the central bank does something that a significant percentage of their users don't like, they will rapidly lose users, effectively losing control of "their" currency. There would need to be an entirely new mechanism of control for the paradigm to be of any use to an agency that wishes to set policy.

You might be able to do it enough to pass a casual inspection, but if someone were to completely break down the data stream *and* they had all the original sent data and the source private keys for any encryption, then any data addded by the attacker would be obvious. Also, if you use this method, the attacker would generally need to have the destination endpoints compromised in order to retrieve any target data.  


Though I suppose this might be theoretically possible, in practice I think it's very unlikely. My thinking is that for any data on a packet switching network like the Internet, timing is seldom preserved with any accuracy. In fact before your data even leaves your house, the timing of the packets has likely been altered twice by rebroadcast from the router and then from the modem. After that, each hop on the Internet that is not a node compromised by the attacker could further randomize any information encoded by packet timing.

I'm confused. How did you get the impression that Electrum, or really any Bitcoin wallet client, was presenting itself as a truly private transaction platform? I just looked over the [Electrum website and FAQ]( and found nothing implying the Electrum wallet is intended to operate in a purely private manner.  
Bitcoin itself is not inherently private, only pseudonymous. Any conventional electronic payment network alternative to Bitcoin is not private, as you always must disclose private information and usage records with at least one counter-party. Therefore, I don't think it's reasonable to presume that anyone, even those new to Bitcoin, should think that using Electrum automatically makes their online transactions somehow *more* private.

Theoretically you could, but perhaps not instantly, as I don't know how quickly an exchange's order book would refill if you clear it out with market orders. A real-world obstacle would likely be getting all the fiat onto an exchange in the first place.

Individual merchants set their own acceptance policies.

I concur that it's important to keep this bigger picture in mind.  
Also, though I admit to not following every bit of LN news, I'm somewhat surprised to not hear any buzz about the communications layer that will be necessary. In order for LN to fulfill it's promise of moving vast transactional traffic off of the block chain, a significant amount of data will need to be transferred from sender to recipient and among any LN nodes involved (i.e. signed and encumbered transactions, etc.) In a hub-and-spoke model, I was sort of OK with this not getting addressed in too much detail, since one or more centralized provider could always make their own arrangements for this. However, with a decentralized routing plan I have many questions, such as:  
* Will this communications channel now be an integral part of LN?  
* Will data be sent in the clear (which seems to go against decentralized routing), or will end-to-end encryption be used?  
* How is the privacy/anonymity of this channel being addressed?
* Will known technologies like Bitmessage and TOR be used or adapted?  
* Will communications also be decentralized, and if so, how?
Nailing the communications aspect down would definitely give a better idea of what LN will actually look like when it's released.  
Perhaps the decentralized routing system being worked on already addresses this aspect as well, but if so, how it does this is not clear to me.

Since Bitcoin is open-source, anyone can change the code itself including the 21 million unit limit. However, for the change to take effect a consensus of users across the network would need to start implementing the new code.

Hmm. Although I think I follow what you're saying, I'm not sure it's entirely true. In particular, I don't think you need to talk to each chain separately, but you *do* need to assume that both chains might be hearing all of the transactions. See if this makes sense to you: A hard fork means that the code for NewBitcoin is not backward compatible with the code for OriginalBitcoin. But that doesn't really specify what that means with respect to transmitting and accepting individual transactions. It makes sense to assume that some or all OriginalBitcoin transactions may be accepted by NewBitcoin nodes. In the opposite direction, OriginalBitcoin nodes may accept some NewBitcoin transactions, or they might not accept any. They definitely can't accept *all* NewBitcoin transactions, because if they did that would mean it would've been a soft fork at most, and not a hard fork.  
Regardless, if a user stays within either the NewBitcoin *or* OriginalBitcoin networks after the fork, they should be fine and encounter no irregularities. They only might encounter problems if they try to spend coins that were already spent on one fork on the other fork. The spend on the second fork may or may not work depending on how much transaction cross-talk got into that fork from previous transactions that were intended only for the other fork.  
I think that's right. If I got you to read this far, what do you think?

I'm not clear on why this would be needed over the existing "proof of existence"-type services. Just submitting a document to the Bitcoin block chain is already accurate to within a few hours.

and then submit the hash of the signed documents.  
I'm not aware than anyone has developed a truly decentralized time service, so including a selection of timestamps from several independent centralized services seems like it would be a good option.

If you generated the receive address by using an unsynchronized Bitcoin Core instance and:


by this you mean that you checked your receive address on Blockchain.info and it shows the correct balance with at least one confirmation, your funds are safe.  
Assuming you are using the latest Bitcoin Core, synchronization should take less than a day (probably around eight hours). Bitcoin Core is overkill for most users, and most find Electrum more suitable.  
You *can* import your private key for the address you used to Electrum, but I've not done this personally so I don't feel qualified to advise.  
Once your Bitcoin Core synchronizes, your funds will be available, but if you're not going to leave Core running, or at least start it for ten minutes or so every few days, I'd consider creating an Electrum wallet and sending your funds over. If Core is left unused for extended periods, it will need to synchronize again the next time you want to receive funds (it shouldn't take too long, but depending on the unused time period, it could be hours). Switching to Electrum will also free up some 30 GB of storage space from your hard drive.

Take a look at the hash rate even now. There's still a significant amount hashing the original chain. Far more than Core's 5% definition for "contention".

I don't think Bitcoin Core will even let you submit a below-dust-limit transaction. If there are any miners out there that accept less-than-dust transactions, you might be able to seek them out, then script code that repeatedly tries to submit a tiny transaction to them directly until it's accepted into one of their mempools. The script may need to continuously retry until the transaction gets into a block, though.  
EDIT: If no such miners exist, you could always code one yourself and try to find your own block. You may need a little (/s) hash power and *a lot of time* to accomplish this, though.  
EDIT 2: I just realized you are asking what is the smallest entire transaction that has already happened. I don't know, but perhaps someone good with a block explorer could tell you.

You can't have Bitcoin if you don't have mining. Right now each newly mined block has a reward of newly minted bitcoins *and* all the transaction fees from the transactions included in the block. The value of the newly minted blocks currently dwarfs the value of the transaction fees, but that amount keeps halving. After about 2140, there will be no more newly minted bitcoins, but there will always be transaction fees. How much the average total of fees comes to at that time is up for speculation, but if it doesn't represent a large amount of value there just won't be as much incentive to mine, and difficulty will automatically adjust downwards. In basically any scenario, there should always be some amount of mining, as long as there is any value to the transaction fees.

They couldn't, the risk would only be for coins associated with private keys that were stored in your unencrypted wallet.dats. If the theft only involved newer private keys that were always stored encrypted, this wouldn't be how the crime was accomplished.

This would not work, because zero fee transactions are based on several factors, one of which is coin age (or priority). If you just send the same coins back and forth, the age of the coins at the next send becomes very young (i.e. low priority). As a zero fee transaction, it could take days before this is picked up by a miner. These measures are in place in the network to avoid these useless, Spam-like transactions.

At the time of the hard fork, at 13%+ of Ethereum hash rate was still mining the original chain. That's "contentious" by Core's 5% standard.

One of the main points of Bitcoin is to have the *option* to be as decentralized as possible. That's what the reference client provides (as well as other implementations, such as [btcd]( But just because you can be fully decentralized doesn't mean every user must elect to operate this way.

I think original comment is quite clear: he/she likes Bitcoin's finite 21 million unit cap and wouldn't want to own any bitcoins if they weren't finite. is wondering why wouldn't be interested in a coin that had a constant 50 coin reward since in the long term that ends up representing low and constantly decreasing inflation on a per cent basis. (To me it seems was already quite clear in stating his preference and does not need to justify his choice any further).  
What I'm saying is OP and are expressing a preference for a set of money supply rules different from those already set down in Bitcoin. Well, it's a monumental task to try to get Bitcoin's rules changed. You likely won't succeed, but if you manage to be disruptive enough you could hurt Bitcoin's valuation for an indeterminate period of time through your effort. It's a damn sight easier to just exchange your bitcoins for an altcoin that already has suitable money supply rules, or even just to start your own altcoin that completely suits your preferences. And by using either of these alternatives you'd achieve your goal without the risk of trashing your own net worth while tilting at windmills.

The point at which miners must stop mining approaches gradually over a period of time, allowing miners to plan for the situation economically. If miners elected to support OP's proposed change, they'd risk collapsing the price of Bitcoin (both old or new) for some unknown period of time. So miners in this situation would have two choices: 1) support the original block chain and get the sure returns of winding down their mining business (ceasing operational expenses and selling assets (ASICs) that would have better residual value the more stable the marketplace remains,) or 2) support the new block chain and introduce a massive amount of new risk into your continuing business. In choosing option 2, miners would be committing to paying expenses in a dramatically more uncertain environment *hoping* that market turbulence doesn't tank the price of NewBitcoins more than 50%. They'd also be gambling that the new fork doesn't fail as a viable economy immediately or at some point down the road. If things go badly, they'd also be risking getting far less or even nothing at all for their remaining ASIC inventory should they decide to close shop and sell.  
Although miners might be risk seeking in general, I find it impossible to believe that almost all of them would elect to take on vastly more risk when the higher returns that might motivate such a gamble don't even seem likely.

If the contents of the file you saved from Electrum is simply raw transaction data, you should be able to push it directly to the Bitcoin network in a variety of ways. For instance, you can use Blockchain.info's interface here:  
  
If that works, then somehow the importing to your online Electrum client is not working. If that fails, perhaps the information you saved to the file from your offline wallet is faulty somehow. Unfortunately, I haven't tried Electrum's offline capability yet, so this is just general advice.  


If you intend to ensure safety (coldness) of your funds at your offline Electrum wallet, it should never be connected to the Internet. In this case, it will never know the balances sent to the private keys created from its seed. This is what the root public key and your online Electrum client are for. Hope that helps.

This is the type of imprecise and indirect answer that is prone to come from both Blockstream and Core. Do you support luke-jr's position to *reduce the current block size limit*. It's a simple yes or no question.  
What does "prioritize" even mean? You want *more* decentralization in the system than there is now? Because as I explained before, the current level can be maintained *as the block size limit is increased*. Please explain in your thinking, how much decentralization would be too much and how much would be too little. We could always maximize decentralization via block size by reducing the limit as much as possible. But somehow that doesn't result in a very useful system.  


Nothing you wrote established this as fact, or even discussed your technical reasoning in specific.  


Citation please. Or at least your own personal technical reasoning instead of just jumping to your conclusion.  


[I'll just leave this here](  
Bitcoin is not some idealized perfection, it has always been a "good enough" solution of the Byzantine General's problem. Attempting to hold any one characteristic of the system as sacrosanct strangles the overall network. It is the greater Bitcoin community, through market actions that should determine how it evolves. It should absolutely not be up to some subset of the community to impose what *it thinks should be a particular* limit, but the community as a whole that decides. I think this will eventually occur regardless, but the way things are progressing (largely as a result of duplicitous actions by the incumbents), a subset of Bitcoin could end up destroying its premier position in favor of alternatives before the overall community is heard.

Yes, the resulting coins could battle over the term/name "bitcoin", but I think that would really be incidental. Assume the new constantly inflating coin wins the name "bitcoin". Say those on the original chain start calling themselves "truebitcoin". It's just a rose by any other name. It's the characteristics of the cyrpto-currency that will make the difference, and I'd always rather own a coin that has an (eventually) deflating money supply as opposed to one that does not.

I see. I must admit, I responded to the context of your reply from memory and didn't review the comment thread first, so my apologies if I conflated your position. I think we're largely in agreement.  


Fees as incentives clearly do have an effect, and I think they're most useful in the simplest contexts. But financial incentives alone allow for a much wider array of behavioral response than a closed system such as a central bank's existing control of their fiat.  


I can definitely see that, but fee driven behavior often results in unintended consequences due to unforeseen and unaccounted for economic (or even political) factors as well. This can even be seen in Bitcoin in the extent of the ASIC industry and the concerns about mining centralization. Still, the behavioral flexibility that results from only economic incentives seems more suitable in open and growing system like Bitcoin. For central banks, it would represent a sea change for them to switch paradigms and embrace the increased uncertainty. I agree that possibility is remote.

Your existing copy of Electrum does not depend on what happens to the person/organization that is currently developing Electrum. It *does* require an Electrum server to connect to, but there are a large number of these. If somehow all of these servers were shut down, you could also download and run the Electrum server software for yourself. Then you could keep using your copy of Electrum indefinitely (until some upcoming change in the Bitcoin protocol forces you to switch to wallet software that has updated code). If that happens you could just send your funds to another wallet via the block chain, or you could use your seed or export your private keys as others have described.

For any one person to try to supplant common usage with their personal preference is ridiculous and beyond arrogant. The phrase "paper wallet" is widely used and commonly understood. Is it the best possible phrase? Perhaps not. But IMHO, it is not so bad or inaccurate that Bitcoin users must rise up to correct it overnight. Especially if a minority is trying to impose their agenda through deceptive and underhanded actions. The generally accepted term is very approachable, making it easy to grasp for users that may lack technical knowledge of Bitcoin. The same is definitely *not true* of the proposed replacement “Paper ECDSA private keys”. If you dispute the utility or wisdom of using printed/written address/private key pairs, or if you have security concerns, by all means express your points of view. Likewise, if you feel the term is inexact or a misnomer, explain why. But do it by using the name that most in the community already recognize in order to facilitate discussion. If the arguments themselves have merit, they may lead to an evolution of the name, or even a movement away from relying on the concept. But like it or not, the idea of a "paper wallet" is well established right now and many currently find utility in their use.

OK, first a couple of caveats: 1) I didn't think up this attack, I just read about it, so don't take any of this as absolute gospel, 2) This is just one way to exploit it that I thought of; there are likely many other more clever ways to take advantage of this. To begin, I have to assume you did not use the fix I proposed in my original post.  
Let's say you've got some ETH in an address before the fork. After the fork, now you've got the same amount in both ETHF and ETHC at the same address but on different chains. The value of the amounts in USD is now different, even though the numerical amount of ETHx is the same. To make things simple, let's say the amount in ETHC is worth $200, and the amount in ETHF is worth $40,000 ($200 x 200, roughly the difference in network security/total hashrate between the two chains right now). So you decide you want to move the ETHC to an exchange to sell. You send the $200 worth of ETHC to the address provided by the exchange, but there's a crook working for this exchange. He sees the transaction and keeps a copy of the raw transaction for himself. Meanwhile, the send goes through and the exchange now has $200 worth of ETHC credited to your account and you're happy. Next, the crook checks the same send address for ETHF and sees the $40,000 worth sitting there. No one at this exchange is expecting a transaction at the ETHF receive address, since your official transaction was just for ETHC. The crook broadcasts the same transaction to the ETHF network and sends your $40,000 worth of ETHF to the same receive address on the ETHF chain. But the exchange is not looking for funds there, so as soon as it's received, the thief sends it to an address of his, quits his job, and goes on a very nice vacation on your dime.

You may need to qualify the term "inexpensive" here, as I suspect it may mean something different when you are operating with approximately $76 million of VC bankroll. If you include billed legal hours, and perhaps PR efforts such as this, I suspect the cost is less than trivial.  


You'll have to correct me if I'm wrong here, but Blockstream has no publicly disclosed product or service, no publicly disclosed income or revenue stream, and no publicly disclosed business plan, yet we are to take on faith that a massively VC-funded start-up is footing the administrative and legal costs of patenting Bitcoin community intellectual property *without private funds*? Perhaps you can provide some transparency here to allay community concerns.  
As far as I can see, any claimed benefits from this move to the Bitcoin community will hinge first on trust in good behavior by Blockstream, then secondly on the vicissitudes of the civil legal system should promises be broken. I can see where Blockstream will get its funding for it's legal litigation, but somehow I think the average Bitcoin community member may have a harder time acquiring and funding a similarly formidable legal presence.  
For the sake of argument, let's say these patents are granted to Blockstream. Let's then say that the value of these patents begin to appreciate over time. What guarantee is there to the community that any profitable return from use of the patents as equity or collateral for further loans or investment is duly returned to the Bitcoin community at large?  
Further, let's anticipate a time when, whether intentional or not, the patents come on the market and are then sold. What ensures that any appreciation in the value of the patents gets returned to the community (less Blockstream's initial costs to establish the patent(s))?  
If Blockstream had operated from day one as an open, welcoming, forthright, inclusive, and demonstrably trustworthy steward for the Bitcoin community, it might be possible to defend the inappropriateness of a central, for-profit company patenting the open-source community innovation of a radically decentralized project. Should they have done this, they may have earned some trust from the community, even though one of Bitcoin's precepts is to operate trustlessly. However, Blockstream has always been opaque, deaf to the community as a whole, obstructionist, tacitly censorship-supporting, and indifferent to the colossal appearance of conflict of interest it casts over Bitcoin development and governance. The chilling effects you speak of seem to pale in comparison to the chilling effect *this announced move* will have on Bitcoin as a whole.

Not trying to step in for and you may already have your own ideas on the subject, but some things that mitigate this problem for Bitcoin are the use of multi sig solutions, or using misdirection wallets that only contain a token amount of funds. Neither solution is perfect, and in the latter case, if the extortionist *knows* the amount of funds you have at your sole discretion (i.e. no protective multi sig), you'll be out of luck.

Considering how rife with fraud every level of gold business must be based on [estimates that the "paper gold" market is 100 times larger than the amount of physical gold in existence]( news on *actually revealed* scams seems surprisingly sparse. To wit, some quick searching shows [one of the largest gold-related scams]( seems to have broken way back in 1997. [Here's Zero Hedge's recent recap]( Apart from that, most gold-related sites have warnings about "paper gold", though actual reports about the collapses of such ponzi/pyramid/fractional reserve operations is nowhere to be found. Taking only stories from larger media and consumer protection sources, I only turned up a general story [from ABC in 2012]( [a cash-for-gold warning story from ConsumerAffairs.com]( and [a BBC News story about a UK gold scam](  
I don't know whether this is because everyone already knows that gold and gold-related investments are hot beds of fraudulent activity so that it's no longer newsworthy, or for more nefarious reasons.  
I'm not even sure there's a simple solution to this problem. Even if you physically hold all of your own gold, are you going to thoroughly and accurately assay every part of each piece yourself? Otherwise you're just trusting other counter parties that could be just as corrupt as the rest of the industry.

As a supporter of raising the block size limit, I'd be all for Core (or Classic) forking to a new POW because no matter which side of the debate you're on it would allow the market to decide. Of course, if Core forks POW then Classic wouldn't have to, and vice versa.  
Ultimately, the post-fork block chain that gets the most market support will decide whether some miners get "punished", though it may not turn out the way you seem to think it would.

Not according to its title. Most other submissions like this get deleted.  


Non-mining nodes do not make a hard fork any more or less difficult. They simply continue to operate on their own chain. Post-fork, another chain may be available, but the node client would need to change to operate on that new chain.  


I've never subscribed to the contention that miners are "rulers" of the Bitcoin network, but any fork must be initiated by at least some miners.  


I dispute that Satoshi intended anything of the sort, or community adoption of hard forks would be impossible. Nodes can choose to run code with any rules they like, but at least some miners would need to be supplying complying new blocks for them for the network to be functional.  


That Bitcoin is already tamper-resistant does not mean that anything need be done to make hard forks *artificially* harder than they already are.  
What's hard is for a post-fork chain to establish market dominance. That's the mechanism that determines relevance in Satoshi's system.

If too many people try to sell at the same time, there won't be enough buy orders to buy the quantity for sale at that price point, so some sellers must lower their prices to get their bitcoin sold immediately. This is what creates downward pressure on the price of bitcoin.  
If too many people want to buy bitcoin at a certain price point, the opposite occurs providing upward price pressure.

Yes.  


Nothing. In fact some speculate that that is what's preventing ETHC from being sold already, what's known as the "replay attack": where a valid transaction from one chain is used on the other. Apparently Ethereum included no protections against this in their fork.  
I'm not sure it's really much of a concern, though. It seems you could simply create a new address on ETHF and send your ETHF balance to it first (since that's apparently the more valuable chain), followed by creating a different address on ETHC and then send all your ETHC balance to that, fixing the "replay attack" issue. Perhaps there's something more that I'm not seeing.

But that's the problem everyone pointed out when they put forth SegWit as a substitute for a simple raise of the block size limit. There is code to raise the block size limit now, SegWit is still a question mark.  
No one from Core will even discuss why they don't relieve pressure by raising the block size limit first, and release SegWit when it's good and ready and everyone agrees it's the right solution for the issues at hand.  
In fact, if Core *were* to raise the block size limit first, it would go a long way towards addressing criticism that they are in the pocket of Blockstream.

Hard forks only need to be as difficult as they inherently are, that's the basic design of the system. There's no need to make them artificially *more difficult*.

As devil's advocate, how does it suggest hard forks are already being made *less difficult*?
@_date: 2016-07-21 12:28:03
Nothing, but OP's post implies that hard forks should be *made* difficult. Hard forks are only as difficult as they are. No attempts to increase their difficulty are necessary, and if they are made, they alter the original intent of Bitcoin.  
I agree with what you're saying in both of your bullet points apart from characterization (i.e. "disenfranchised", "chaos"), but that's the system in Bitcoin (and almost all decentralized block chain cryptocurrencies). By using it, you're accepting it.  
The reason I dispute your characterizations is that users on the eventual losing chain are not choosing to be "disenfranchised". They must honestly believe their chain will succeed, or have some other motivation. Either way, if value goes down on that chain eventually it would be by user choice, not "disenfranchisement".  
I believe a functioning free market might sometimes be characterized as chaotic, but I don't agree that such a situation is "chaos". Following perhaps some initial volatility and discovery, free markets would find a price equilibrium and continue as they always have.

Incentives may persuade, but can't "force". You've got to keep in mind the kind of control that central banks have right now, and consider whether they would settle for anything less in a crypto-currency. In conventional economic systems, there is no way to avoid central bank policy. Anyone using the associated fiat is locked in. With an incentive based system like the one you suggest, which admittedly may be a step towards encouraging a distributed network to follow a central policy, you would still never achieve the 100% locked-in compliance that central banks now enjoy. Would they be willing to give up some of this control in order to move toward a semi-centralized crypto-currency? Perhaps, but I don't think it's likely.  
Still, at some point in the future it might be possible to create a system that achieves all of the goals of a central bank. I just think that as yet, no proof of concept for such a system exists, and that any work towards such a system does not seem very far along. Of existing cryptos, nearly all could not be pressed into service as-is to achieve a central bank's requirements. And IMHO, the ones that may be closest (perhaps Ripple/Stellar), are still too complex, centralized, unproven and/or underdeveloped to serve as the foundation for the development of a future central bank system.

Short answer: yes.  
Long answer: assuming the wallet you are using is doing everything right, and there is no flawed RNG involved, sending and receiving repeatedly from a single address is still safe, but just not *as* safe as not re-using addresses. The additional risks break down like this:  
1) Sending from an address the first time makes the public key visible in the block chain. The public key is a double-hash closer to the private key than the address. But even if an attacker has your public key, you're still very safe.  
2) Repeated sends publish more transactions signed by this particular private key. If someone manages to collect one or more such signed transactions, they can theoretically use the information as data to try to reverse from the public key back to candidate private keys. In theory, to make such attempts, the more data the attacker has the better, so he/she would attempt to gather as many signed transactions as possible. As a first step, lots of data might help reveal flaws or patterns in the RNG that was used to create the transactions. Still, AFAIK, there's currently no known exploit where *any amount* of this data could realistically reverse from a public key back to candidate private keys. But advances in cryptography are occurring all the time, so things could change.  
3) Lots of transactions involving this address mean more records in the block chain. This increases the odds that your address could attract the attention of an attacker, but it doesn't make executing an attack any easier.  
4) Every wallet that receives funds from this address or that sends funds to this address will likely log the transaction. Weak security at any of those endpoints could increase the exposure of your address.  
5) (This one doesn't apply to you if you are signing with your Trezor.) If you're not using off-line signing, the private key for this address is being used from a hot wallet. The longer you sign using this private key in this manner, the more it is exposed in a "hot" situation, and that means the probability increases that it will be compromised increases with time.  
That's all I can think of.

You choose luke-jr's arguments about block size? He's been demanding the block size limit be reduced for years. Do you agree with his position?  
I'm looking more for technical discussion why the 1 MB block size limit is somehow optimal. Why, since technological capability is ever increasing, if the 1 MB limit was optimal yesterday, why it shouldn't be marginally higher today. Or perhaps the correct figure isn't even 1 MB to begin with, since when it was implemented in around July 2010, it was over 100x larger than the average block size at the time. In the intervening years, this large block headroom has caused no disasters, and had no Core/Qt devs demanding to reduce it (save perhaps luke-jr).  
If you won't admit there's currently a block congestion issue that's only getting worse, than we don't even have common ground to begin discussion.

"Normal" Bitcoin fees applied when there wasn't block congestion. Sadly, that's no longer the case, and you'll need to do dynamic fee calculation based on at least the data size of your transaction and the current fee rates (a function of how much backlog there is in mempools at that time). You also need to be aware that if the block congestion surges just after you send your transaction, any economical dynamic fee calculation can still result in a delayed transaction. In these cases, ensuring your transaction makes it in the next block would effectively require the ability to predict the future.  
If you prefer the old days of "normal" fees, you may want to consider supporting a block size limit increase that would serve to relieve the block congestion currently plaguing Bitcoin.

Well, there'd be no fiat in your imagining, but you'd be able to choose among barter, gold, and Bitcoin. It's up to the free market.

It doesn't matter how many coins anyone has or any coalition has, they simply can't force everyone to join them on their fork. They can of course try, and in the process torpedo the value of all bitcoins, damaging their own holdings the most in absolute terms (at least for some undetermined period of time). Any bitcoin holders that choose to avoid the cabal's fork can continue on their own on the original block chain. If most or all of the Bitcoin economy defects to the cabal's fork, original Bitcoiners will need to realize they'll have to basically reset, rebuilding their economy ground up, and also that the value of their coins may dive further in the short term than the value of coins on the new fork due to the cabal's strong arm tactics. But no one will ever be able to issue more Bitcoins on the original block chain than was originally intended.  
In any case, if the point of the cabal is just to have a different set of money supply rules, it's far easier to switch to using an altcoin that already has suitable rules, or to create a new altcoin. And choosing this route instead would avoid having to survive a large valuation disruption of undetermined length.

The 6% attempting the attack on the old chain would be forgoing all of their new chain revenue. Instead, they'd only earn only old chain bitcoins (which would be useless to the attackers, and which the attack would be destroying the value of.) They'd also need to sustain the attack for a long period (especially with a ~100 minute block time) just to be effective, costing themselves even more profit. Such an attack would only force a quick consensus among the old chain to hard fork to a new mining algorithm. So the attackers would have given up their potential profits just to force the old chain to become immune to their attacks faster.

For that to happen, alternative viewpoints would have to be allowed.

You sure had to work hard to get banned, though, didn't you? You spent hours flooding with nonsense submissions just to be disruptive. In my opinion, this kind of behavior deserves a site-wide Reddit ban.

Greg's activity with anything involving Ethereum is all new, and sudden. Characterize it how you like.  
I still don't see how added funding would've changed the outcome of Ethereum's hard fork.

On the contrary, I think that would've been much more accommodating and gradual than what Ethereum actually did. If anything it should go even smoother.

In fact, I think it's particularly instructive to see how hard forks have been successfully carried out in any number of altcoins, of which Ethereum is perhaps the most notable.
