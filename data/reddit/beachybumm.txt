Someone in shorting it. Wasn't there a whole article from Citron about the arbitrage play?

Yes, I understand perfectly. And it'll continue to drop until it's even w bitcoin. My point was that I couldn't even short it, and I don't understand why.

Whether or not it's an indicator is not my concern. There's no good reason for a 100% premium when it can be bought on the futures market with liquidity for a 2% premium. The only reasonable explanation for such a premium, when the underlying asset is bitcoin, is that uninformed investors are buying into it. I want to sell before I'm left with the hot potato, which is inevitable. Once etfs, futures, options, etc become the norm, as well as easier ways to buy bitcoin on exchanges, there will be no use for gbtc and it'll collapse. Why would You pay $2000 for a bar of gold when you can buy it for $1000?
It's basically a guaranteed arbitrage situation. I don't see how an investor could lose by shorting gbtc and buying long futures against it.
Anyone disagree?

Exactly. Thus, why I want to short it, but can't seem to accomplish that.

My broker said they don't do that and they don't know any retail investor who does.

Is there any reason I can't short GBTC in my Fidelity retail account? It doesn't allow me to do it, despite having no issue w other stocks.
Is there a site that allows it?

So then gbtc is just illogical? It has nothing to do with the price of bitcoin, it just goes up and down with wild swings without reason?
There are no options, but there are plenty of futures. If bitcoin is 20k and the future premium is 1%, the future is 20,200. Meanwhile, at a 100% premium, gbtc is 40k. If you short gbtc (because you believe the premium will narrow) and long the future, you'd make a monster profit. That's based on the simple assumption that the premium is unlikely, in the long term, to stay at 100%, which it likely won't. Eventually, like the futures market, gbtc will be pinned to BTC.

Right. So how is he shorting it? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:38:12
But assuming the premium is irrational, what makes you think that if BTC increases, GBTC won't continue increasing with it? That's the only way. In which case, GBTC doesn't have much room to move and make money, and you'd still be better off buying BTC directly.
Also, why not arbitrage and guarantee a win? How could one lose shorting GBTC and buying futures in BTC?
