Just look at: [reddit.comThere's no mention of Bitcoin Cash whatsoever and their only real goal is to confuse people about which is the "real" bitcoin

That was the point, to make you not care about free speech because the site was a "piece of shit"
You should watch the doc about it: "Nobody Speak: Trials of the Free Press"

You don't think that's an important aspect to start thinking about now?

Just curious, after all the coins have been mined won't miners rely on fees to support the network?  With zero to no fees, how will that ensure miners will stick around to support the network?  Is the hope that there will a huge increase in these micro transactions?

Could we also sink a BCash wallet to the bottom of the ocean?

I was wondering: if BTC as a currency happens to drop out of existence, will these coins still be valuable based on the rarity and the historical importance?

It seems like virtual currency is going to be big, just not with Bitcoins. 
Bitcoins seem to be treated more like stock rather than currency.  With bitcoins, there are only a finite amount available. People will be more likely to mine them rather than use them for what they were supposed to be used for - exchanging hands.  Remember the Sacagawea dollar!?
Bitcoins would be nice, but a more easily obtainable and less volatile type of virtual currency would work out better

Ooof those comments are painful to read:
"End of the day, the car was bought with dollars. No one really paid in bitcoins."

Obtaining bitcoins is hard work.  MONEY IS ON COMPUTER!?

Great work!  It would also be helpful if we had a screencast of the BUYING bitcoin process
