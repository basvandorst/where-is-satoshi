You’re an alt star
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:56:54
Awesome! I’ll keep trying 
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:19:12
I’ll give it a go after some hard research!
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:22:38
I can spend my fucking bitcoin if I want to. Wtf? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:47:20
I guess I’m risk averse. Wouldn’t begin to know how to apply that. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:39:03
All just more buying opportunities my dear friend!
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:25:20
Parting for fiat.* I’ve spent half my bitcoin and rebought with USD each time I do. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:45:35
You are helping. I’ll continue my bitcoin collection. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:35:29
I’d suggest you take your own advice. I’m already there. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:33:27
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:42:01
I’m afraid it’d go up right as I sold and I’d regret it. So I just walk away. No way can I convince myself that I know enough to win every time. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:11:07
Tell him to buy 1000$ worth of bitcoin now then. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:49:36
Why can’t I see it on the app?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:26:47
Bought more today  feels weird man
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:53:26
Hope so. Would use.

Bitcoin is BCash. So BCash must be finished too. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:07:05
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:05:43
I'd like to know who made it...do they know about Bitcoin and are sending messages or just so clueless...
@_date: 2019-07-03 17:37:14
Just another apt

Good to at least see all the 1% change columns on cmc green again. Almost imploded there. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:32:08
Right?! I e been partying for a week straight! No time to be an ingrate. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:16:57
Or down, the other way that is possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:29:32
So rad
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:11:02
Yup. Might have to be dragged through the trenches a bit before I take that kinda talk seriously. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:20:58
But I agree with this point and it’s why I’ll hodl BTC until I can use it wherever I want. And then I’ll still hodl.

Trezor.io is where I got mine. Love it to mbits. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:36:43
What’s the reason for the recent spike? Don’t just say it’s a great coin blah blah. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:48:56
V true v true. Side note: I had a buddy last night try to buy iota but started with litecoin on coinbase and could not withdrawal it for the life of him. Kept getting some messed up code. Maybe other people are also having this problem. 
That’s my conspiracy theory. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:24:15
What happened
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:54:12
No. There is no tech support and your still exposing your seeds/whatever is on the usb to whomever is hacking your computer when you go to open usb files. 
Aka get a trezor. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:00:29
Not much different I’d guess. Just more relaxed??? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:19:39
Low gravity baby

My boyfriend talks about it just as much as me after I taught him about it a year and a half ago.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:44:06
He has to be trolling

@_date: 2017-12-09 23:53:42
Yeah they need to start writing down what they say so at least they can read about how crazy they are. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:50:22
Better be. I’m up at five am hoping for shit to get better.

@_date: 2017-12-20 01:04:03
Wait. Just wait. Movement takes time. You invested for reasons at the time that hold true still. Don’t let swings make you weak. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:49:31
I would tooooo
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:22:30
I got into bitcoin while tripping. Back at $4000. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:52:23
Why would this increase bitcoins price? Or be beneficial?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:06:42
Where’s this?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:12:20
So claiming you know what will happen is humility to you? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:17:15
It’s so awkward to say to anyone in real life that has never heard the term. You know that right? It means hold. They wouldn’t get the joke. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:38:26
This makes me want one. Even though when ever I get one I always end up spending it on Bitcoin shirts. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:49:16
Pay wall

Nahhhhh just by principle. There’s better ships to ride. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:39:05

@_date: 2017-12-10 18:37:51
I have! This rockets got lots of gas too. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:53:38
Hahah the I totally appreciate this more. His reaction is what actually happens with people I tell to get into it. Drives me nuts trying to cement in their brains how to hodl and why. Worth the effort though.

Blockfolio and Delta really should have their apps show the portfolio total change by more than just the day. How about weekly or monthly as well? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:00:57
Yep and that’s why I’m having a hard time with 1 out of the 5 people I w gotten into bitcoin. He acts like only free or sell. I’m not one for convincing people so his time will run its course.

Time is going by as fast as bitcoin is going up. Scary. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:19:45
Very true. It’s a worth my risk to take I guess. I’m just not interested in it. Put it in coins I love. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:40:57
I’ve got too many to do the quick math. Poop

Coinbase is cheaper after lower fees plus btc price premium. Square is close but the premium is higher so you need a greater percent gain to get to a positive net gain.

So true. Hodler for life 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:34:39
I traded my ETH for BTC so we’re both hoping for some good news haha
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:04:04
That will the problem of uncertainty? What is your game plan for the fork and getting your forked coin?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:54:43
Also college student. Did the big dive into crypto in August. V happy.

Seems so that with more adoption comes more value as more people will be transacting as a whole. Makes sense to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:52:34
What explain
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:53:31
Hahaha wish I was there to scoff loudly
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:33:06

@_date: 2017-11-12 09:23:21
Just did
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:28:51
Sounds like the right plan. Might steal
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:17:13
So glad I woke up at 130 Am for this. Got some cheaper BTC and got to watch it all go down. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:34:23

That’s when I got in!!! The fear transformed into disbelief and then pure joy
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:18:31
Bitcoin must have been made by AI

Awwwww this made me love you hahah
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:48:15
By the time it’s high enough to cash out, everything will be purchasable with Bitcoin so it would be counter productive to cash out. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:28:34
Bahahah fuck yes
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:03:34
I like a little risk and suspense in my life ��

@_date: 2017-10-09 19:41:22
Does it split into those two automatically once sent to Bitfinex? If not, what would I do to make this happen? Thank you! ���� 
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:09:49
So I should just wait then. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:00:53
This is the gif that drew me into Bitcoin in August. Now here I am sitting on some bitcoin and happy to have gone through the lows. Ready for more. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:09:11
If it saves me from having to pick out another present, I dont really care.

Thank you! The kind of response I was in need of. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:08:47
Where can I get this?
@_date: 2018-12-20 00:10:22
I just didn’t know if they’re was any other way other than phone wallet I guess. Like logging into a screen with your trezor at the site of purchase. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 02:21:41
Took you long enough.  
@_date: 2018-12-20 00:10:54
Assume I’m not worthy of nice things hahah
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:35:55
I love this. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:38:03
Yep! You’d be part of the .13% in this world.
@_date: 2019-05-07 16:25:26
Love how this guy put it...he answers exactly what you're asking. A must watch. You're on the right path.
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:18:00
See! Now this would be cool... I like where your heads at.
