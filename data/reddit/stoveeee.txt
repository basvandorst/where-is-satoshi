Thanks! I'll check it out. Is the going rate near market prices?

Thank you for this post. Do you know a good place where we can still talk about use cases, adoption, and applications?
Hats off to an old hat by the way ;)

The fact that you're getting so much shit for this speaks to how much this sub has changed. Much respect my friend - its people like you driving the revolution forward.
how do you spend your crypto? Do you buy your necessities online at a vendor that accepts, do your local vendors happen to accept crypto, or do you use a payment professor?

Is there a place where we *can* talk about adoption/applications/dev?
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:31:51
oo nice. is pretty good for this too.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:26:32
I'll certainly take a look! Thanks

I'm trying to build exactly this, on Ethereum! [Here's the article]( that explains how it works - please ask me any questions you might have :)

Sounds interesting! Where can I find historical data on intraday volatility?
Edit: Also what is adaptive spread sizing?

Thanks! This is what threw me off. I'll take a look!

This could be a dumb question, but how could I pull this data into a Java program and calculate it to find the daily % change in price?
@_date: 2016-05-08 18:11:03
Well I'm just looking at the data and I'm kinda lost. I obviously know how to calculate daily percentage given the starting and ending points but I'm not sure where that is in this table

Okie doke after some struggling I managed to get this file in a viewable format, but sometimes the close price goes from 622 to 62 in a day [like this]( Any idea why that happens?

If anyone's still interested, I found easily accessible closing pries for all of coindesk's history [here](
@_date: 2016-05-10 12:43:03
Ah! Thanks so much I understand it now. Is there anyway to get just the open and close prices from, say, midnight to midnight without downloading all the transactions in the middle? I definitely don't have enough space on my computer to download all the cvs to programmatically sift out that info
@_date: 2016-05-10 11:18:23
Oh! Ok that makes sense. This is from 1coinusd, the first dataset in the list. So would one single .csv.gz file have all the information from one day? And is the third number possibly the change in price that day?

Awesome! Thanks so much :)
