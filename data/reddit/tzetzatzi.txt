Nothing too see here, move along. Wevee got You best interest at heart. If you do not agree with us, its just because you dont want to have an "adult conversation" or that you "dont understand". We are early adopters and want to see Bitcoin getting mainstream, whatever it costs becaus we will become extremely filthy rich. Also wewe want to be legit, law abiding citizens because are good people have nothing to hide and want to become f rich beyond wildest dreams. Nothing bad about that is it?

Actually Im thinking about launching some sort of trading/analysis new letter. Free ofcourse and donation based. Let me know if youre interested :)

Sure thing. All the best to you.

Im not saying the following to be obnoxious but: the price does not care "what is good for btc as currency". The free market is right now doing price discovery which means that bitcoins more orr less guaranteed to become a bubble and then crash. Think Cisco. Went to the moon and then crashed, but Cisco is still here buildimg and selling stuff. Same will most likely happen to bitcoin but right now we do not know the true value because bitcoin is still in its baby early days. My guess isis that bitcoins will go soso high that the entire world will go btc crazy and gov will try to shut it down. Pricee will plummet, peoples lives be devastated and early adpoters will be seeked out on the net by savvy criminals and basically people will get killed. Some will bee so rich that it will be absolutely totally insane. What wvwr you do dont hold onn to all of your coins but never sell all of them either. That way you arw almost guaranteed to profit from it. Also DONT brag about your hoars. Keep your mouth shut. The taxea wontt kill you, but some people will.

Permanent stability... In ann asset... Thought never crossed my mind. Personally I make more money during crashes, soo I hope not
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:16:39
Nice, if people actually understood whats in here they would sell btc for usd, perhaps buy one or two litecoins and stay the hell away from other alts. Also ASICs _is_ an issue -- just as weve known all along. Well.... Since this is far to technical the price willll just head higher and eventually mike hearn will have his way and for sure get support from gov. (perhaps without realizing it, who knows). Good drama here. Should have bought sime popcorn.

Well the creation of a bitcoin bank in Cyprus do prove me right :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:34:47
I own silver, gold mining companies, stock index, cash, bitcoin and litecoin (and more). I am super deversified in a sence. If bitcoin goes to zero I have silver. If gold miners go bust I have stock index. If banks hyper inflate I have silver. I like being diversified. If the bitcoin network is attacked by someone, litecoin network will be humming along. A while back, bitcoin had database issues but litecoin did not soo litecoin did not have a fork. Cryptocoins are not all the same. Sometime some overperform bitcoins. Yes I think there is reasons for diversification.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:28:40
Yes, they can compete by offering litecoins. It would be great for everyone.

@_date: 2013-11-23 16:00:45
Used to wake up inn the middle of night, checked prices, did some trading. Good for my wallet, bad for my body. But honestly to me this is a game. I can afford to feel so, because I only put 1/6 of all of my money into it so if I loose all - its not that much (I did not have a lot ro start off with)
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:22:52
true that.
@_date: 2013-11-16 12:03:41
If they did not mint new cash, cashh would become morevaluable then money at the bank: supply and demand. They are pushing for inflation. Besides they need cash to perculate usd in system d because they want usd to bee universal, so they can be sure that inflation gets exported.
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:24:30
:D always this rationalization going on. Price whipsaws always and there will never be enough rich people to make everbody as rich as them. There are however enough fools to make a fewew rich ones. Bitcoins is just like stockmarket .

Look at it this way, when $1000 is taken out, next stop will be $2000 and then $5000 and soon $10 000. It will happen quickly, people cant believe it right now because brain is not wired to think logarithmic.

Well how aboutt linking tainting to payingng thee taxess. If your tx dont include out to gov. address your tx will be tainted. We could see gov. supporting coin validationn in rhe future.

Ok that sounds better. But how can I be 100% sure that price is not manipulated for stoploss hunting when I have a leveraged position? Do I have to take it on faith? I would love to trade ok margin if I can trust kraken. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:37:21
Yea I remember words press. I also recall this BitPay thingy. Oh and all the talk about how hard it would crash from $20. Bitcoin time is super compressed. I always believed in thousands of usd for a coin but could never imagine it happen in a few months.

It definitely sounds like you should avoid trading! People who trade most often loose. Believe me I make my money trading against people like you.
@_date: 2013-10-09 06:23:34
Lol true that!!!!
@_date: 2013-11-01 08:54:21
Thats not true. A while back ago Bitcoin soft forked and Litecoin did not.
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:12:55
Did u come up with this when price went down or when it went up?

I think lack of anonymity is of bigger concern. Enough with this traceability thing please!

Some people believe in Litecoins some dont. Some people believe in Bitcoins and some dont. Some know that there is huge profits too be made in coin speculation. Honestly, if Bitcoins goes superer global and becomes worth $10k or more - then why would Litecoins goo to zero?

I remeber when wired got a mining rig for free and threw away all the coins they mined. :P
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:11:00
U have the wrong strategy. Never trade with emotions - if you are stressed out u are an emotional trader. Think of it like points in a game and make a plan. Follow the plan. Personally I lost 1/5 of my total net worth and didnt feel a thing. Ive also made more then that at times and still dont feel a thing. That is, as long as I follow my plan. When I act on impulse I hate myself for it. Follow the plan! No feelings. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:23:26
Agree. Everyone still talks about buying.
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:36:40
This. USA wont allow China dominating Bitcoin and Bitcoin businesses. Before this is over USA government will be running mining rigs because they dont want China to be doing all verification.

Have you ever sold ALL your coinss? How many people dump ALL coins? In the beginning people will keep more coins (because they have more) further limiting supply. Neww buyers coming inn all of the time doing same thing. Soon there will not be any whole coins left AND this rise will be exponential and people will not believe their eyes how fast price rise. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:17:41
This whole reminds me that many people think that money should be controlled by a small elite. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:00:22
I coin needs backing by miners. You can create an infinite number of coins, but the numbers of computers are finitee. Hence there can only be a limited number off coins with strong support by miners. Please end this "inflation by infinite number of coins" argument. Its flawed!
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:17:33
Seriously?! I thought this was all fud. Did you use some strange vnp, tor or something like that. Thiss is scary I won't deposit again until this is resolved. Hopeu get your coins!!!

Yes it might be that people ditch ltc along with btc, if bitcoin network is attacked - I can definitely see that happening. But even though I can see that, Im not sure it will hapoen like that. It might be that people switch to ltc. I just don't know - thats why I diversify.

No thats not true. Bitcoin dont use scrypt, dont have same network,  not even same fee structure.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:01:52
Yea I know. At one time I wanted to buy 0.001 bitcoins but had to buy 1 because of that. These "experts" anoy me. Axtually all my friends told me I was like a fool to buy bitcoins at $10. And when I predicted a cyprus like event with money confiscation and that people would flee to bitcoin because of it, people kind of thought I was raving mad I guess. Welll.... Im still confident btc will be worth thousands if dollars.  I have zero belief in these "experts" because I know for a fact that they are behind the curve. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 12:18:06
Well I did not say the runup in price was due to the Cyprus eventt. I wrote that people would flee ti Bitcoin, andd that is exactly the kind of talk we have. Ur boring so Ill end it here. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:13:13
Same old story. Ive seen this coutless times since $10. Often I see my coinss halve inn usd value. Look... Inn 10 years time, do you honestly thinj anyone will remember this? If bitcoins exists then, will they be worth $900? 
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:46:52
I trust nothing in the currency world that has trades ok margin or when u trade against the exchange.
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:57:28
Yes might be the case. I sold some
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:59:57
Actually Im one of the 1% so I guess I will benefit tremendously from coin validator and so forth and soo onon. Also because I could see this coming I have stashed my coinss deep inn the block chain (to be sure not too have fresh lesss "secure" coins). And what will I doo nextt? Well as soon as zerocoin or similarr surfaces I will buy a truck load and make even more. Its disturbing nonon the less and I rather dont make profit like so.
@_date: 2013-10-17 17:56:02
Wow this guy was hilarious. He has noo cluee what he is talking about at all. Love how he said that state issued debt is hard to manipulate. Actually I would go so far as to day that he actually is withhoolding what he really thinksnks and just says what he is supposed to say. Super embarrasing though.

If bitcoin network is attacked, litecoin network is not affected. Vice versa. If bitcoin. Vice versa. Things can go wrong. Never all eggs inn one basket.

@_date: 2013-11-21 20:53:09
Consolidated long time at 50 ema. Extremely bullis. Many people selling and many buying. A good bet is that ltc will overperform btc. BtcUsd is in for a correction down to at least 587 and if price dont bounce it will continue heading much lower. This is good forfor ltcbtc ratio. I just liquidates 50% of all my btc to buy ltc. I am super bullish.
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:32:28
Yes. Ive been here since $10 and seen that pattern repeat itself over and over again. I totally agree with it too. The thing is, it will happen again and again. Weve had many bubbles and will likely have more. Buy low sell high. Etc.
@_date: 2013-09-10 09:53:26

@_date: 2013-12-18 11:03:27
Sell 25% of your coins, if it drops considerably more then buy back. If it climbs considerably from here, then sell another 25%. If it then crashes again buy back.... and so forth and so on. Thats how you trade panicy markets. Or... just hold.
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:43:16
I did the same thing when it went from 10 to 20, but now I learned that btc = crazy bullish, so I sold only 10% at 320-ish. Will sell a little all the way to the top (and we dont know when that will be).
