They could do massive research and see for themselves that if they don't sell in the worst time to sell, at the bodom or near bodom of a bear market they will do allright over time. They could dollar cost average in right know and they will have massive future gains. in the past 10 years it doesn't matter at wich time you bought as long as you held it. 22 USD for 1 LTC was also expensive one day it went up to 300. Again where is the scam? You really think traditional financers would not come in? everybody will come in.. you came in because you saw value..
Block One provides us with the technology faster than a fully decentralized ecosystem where there is no sense of direction and leading. It wil take waaay longer and therefore they will lose marketshare. 
Only time will tell
btw thanks for the kind words, I hope you're fine and well

What is it you call a scam? People did invest themself into a EOS token at 0.50 USD/token. It went to 22 USD months after all the hype in DEC JAN, that is 44 x times your investement. 
I see a smart move by block one putting those ETH tokens into USD. They now are investing1 billion back into the EOS eco system. hat's [1.000.000.000]( USD. 
They are set up for a loooooong time and can survive and thrive multiple bear markets. Do you even realize how much 4 Billion is for a tech company that's tryin to build web 3.0? 
I see no scam, I see value, I see smart people invesing into Block One (and therefore EOS). 
anyway everybody has the right of an opinion but here's mine :) 
good luck brother

you do know you could tokenize this i supose?
check out pixeos and you become the unique token holder of your work, it's like making this the 'original'. makes it more worth in the future if you believe in blockchain i guess.
