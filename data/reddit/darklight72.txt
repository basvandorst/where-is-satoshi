As far as record-keeping, that's actually (potentially) easier with BitCoin as long as you know your wallet ID, right?  The entire transaction history, including when you got what, is RIGHT THERE in the blockchain, no?

Nah...there's NEVER been a misunderstanding on the Interwebs.  :)

Wait, but the Health Insurance Exchange website was such a resounding success.

Nope.  The whole purpose for "ritual suicide" is to retain honor or to prevent the spread of dishonor to your family.  It's becoming more and more apparent that Mark has none to retain and doesn't give a thimble of warm spit about anyone else.

And delivery times are not guaranteed.  We haven't learned this lesson yet?
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:21:45
"beginning to think"?  You've been far more understanding than the rest of us.

Given all that's happened (or not happened today), it sounds like they are being bought out though as it "involves other parties."

Are you the "too the moon" guy and forgot to switch accounts again?

And wasn't Manhattan Island purchased at least in part with "Glass Beads"?
Ridiculous attempt to scare the masses into staying away from bitcoin.  New plan...National Banks/Federal Reserves, how about you just stay away from bitcoin?

Am I the only one who gets the feeling that wasn't put up there by a native English speaker?
"In the event of" is a term you use when discussing a possible future event.
I wonder if someone who has access to the web server (possibly an employee) wrote that on their own and just put it up to try to end the speculation.
Bad job if they did but...

Honest to God, then why bother replying at all.  It takes you longer to type tldr than it does to click back, heaven forbid you have to log in before you leave your "lasting mark" on the post...

They are monitoring the packing of all the bags of the executives.
They are monitoring the purchase of multi-hop plane tickets to some country without extradition to ANYWHERE.
They are monitoring the schedule of the motorcade to the airport.
They are monitoring the temp. of Marks dessert latte.
They are monitoring exchange rate on other exchanges so they can divest themselves of some of that BTC for some cash.
I'm sure the list goes on and on...
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:18:43
And only take BTC for it.

Are you saying Mt. Gox had fleas?
@_date: 2014-02-19 14:20:28
After you've had time to convince him of course.
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:17:45
Ok, so, not trying to poke but why are they bothering?  Does the house, in any way have any influence or say on whether a business can or cannot accept BTC?
I know this is supposed to be on the pros/cons of such but who gives a rip what they decide?  After the IRS declared it to be a commodity rather than a financial instrument, this is just posturing and camera time.  What's next, a panel on the pros and cons of each and every possible thing that could be used for barter (since that's what paying with BTC is, basically, with the IRS statement)?
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:27:26
Oddly enough, that doesn't make me feel any better...about anything.

Understand and agree...to a point.  Ultimately the majority of what we do on the Internet is based on trust, whether it's buying/selling something or the security of our information (however much we choose to share) with a website.
To that end, use escrow.  Yes, you have to trust someone but that's not really a new concept in the big scheme of things.

Who would throw $250B at a $10B market cap?  How about the US Federal Government and the US Federal Reserve?  They throw far more at FAR less with absolutely no legitimate hope of ever coming close to even a 1:1 ROI.

I like the way you think and I'm sure you're a good guy and all but...yeah, that's not gonna happen.

Christ, it's classic NOW.  The look on his face is...that's just AWESOME!

Any chance we could call for a complete ban on Douche-Nozzle Know Nothing Politicians who can't keep their trap closed when it comes to things they are FULLY ignorant of?
I mean, yeah, that would recall all but maybe...2?  I'm actually OK with that though.

From "soon" to "silence" and back to "soon-ish".
I can't believe he actually wrote soon-ish...

Nah...turning, like off a cliff.
