What happens to a market where 90+% of actors are in long positions? What happens when this market crashes? These are genuine questions but I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

By which mechanism is it coordinated?
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:48:19
Exactly this is what I'm talking about. The trouble with gaining a bunch of value in BTC is the inertia of the investment blinds people to their true appetite for risk. Ask yourself : if the money wasn't already in bitcoin would I put this % of my net worth into it? For many the answer would be no I think.

You've got to realise some profits at some point though right?
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:48:08
I hope he's taking some profit while the price is high

When no-one wants it, buy. When everyone wants it, sell.

While your point regarding no change in utility is persuasive there are too many other deeply significant differences to make this any more than a superficial comparison. For bitcoin to realise it's value is a such a deeply disruptive process that it's not a surprise that it is volatile. Beanie babies did not disrupt anything except for that divorcing couple who had to split up their collection under the supervision of judge Judy
@_date: 2018-06-27 23:06:37
Of course you can. You're all over the place! My only contention is that the beanie babies comparison is silly.
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:26:10
Ah yes the old 'your revolutionary decentralised frictionless extra-national store of value has the same utility as cuddly toys' argument
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:00:20
Yes everything is exactly comparable
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:39:03
Good comment.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:13:31
11400$ now
This is insane
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:52:36
haha oh dear that's a big imaginary loss :P

I really hope he doesn't get any publicity for his sudden windfall. Becoming a millionaire overnight ruins a lot of people

It's not quite as bad as you're making out but I do agree both fees and confirmation time are an issue for bitcoin as a local currency. 
Confirmation time can be mitigated by a proper infrastructure which allows vendors to accept 0 confirmation purchases because they are insured. Fees are harder to swallow. 
I still hold bitcoin's main value is as a borderless store of value. This remains useful even with high fees and slower confirmations, but it's not the 'buy a cup of coffee' future many have imagined
@_date: 2019-04-08 04:24:07
Well his whole point here is the essence of conservatism so perhaps it's not surprising it chimes with something of bush's

Have some hummus
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:42:48
Can you actually though
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:26:03
I saw it as more of a discussion on the monopoly on violence which is considered a fundamental principal of statehood. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:44:22
I'll be amazed if bitcoin becomes a collectible.
It doesn't make any sense. If it had a value like 1 mil per coin it would be an insanely valuable asset and therefore be the same as today with an active network. If it had no active network/couldn't be moved around at all etc then it's literally just the ledger anyway which is public. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:36:16
As far as I can tell we're still a way away from proper LN adoption. There's definitely an opportunity for an alt to jump in at this time. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:50:23
At the very least take out enough so you're no longer invested beyond what you can afford to lose. That's just common sense! Then watch and wait. If it stabilises then throw some back in. 
Stop trying to sell at the very top. Think a bit longer term.

In 2013 the market failed the test of access, new money couldn't get in easily enough
 in 2018 it failed the test of meeting scale. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:14:22
Good point thanks
Edit: probably not *every* ICO is a scam but certainly this is a bubble likely to pop

This is NOT how tech products work
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:22:51
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:16:13
haha thank you
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:36:45
Getting ready to pick up some cheap coins myself.. but I sold out on a profit anyway so obviously I'm more relaxed than some
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:16:14
My first response to seeing this: time to sell
