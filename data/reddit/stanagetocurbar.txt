But that's bollocks isn't it. I bought in last September with a small amount of money. Paid for my skiing holiday for next month with profits made, still have more than my original investment in bitcoin.
I'm not talking massive risk investments either, only put in less than half a grand.
Even if it all collapsed today I'll still be up.
I'm not particularly lucky either, if I'd got in just a few weeks earlier I'd have made much more significant gains.
I'm not proposing building your pension with it is a good idea but if you have some spare cash and fancy some fun betting go for it. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:46:22
Err. Yes, that's exactly what it means.
@_date: 2019-07-16 15:57:03
Do you mind me asking how you buy small amounts without getting stung by a poor rate. When Im Purchasing I always have to hit a larger amount (about £150) to get a good rate.

You're preaching to the converted here. I'm hodling and adding to it constantly but there's no way that you can use it instead of a bank at the minute. We've just had a10% change today and that's far from unusual.

Seriously, I see comments like this fairly regularly  but I don't understand them (although I maybe being thick).
In my eyes if I put my wages into bitcoin on a Monday how would I know wether it'll pay for a sandwich on Friday or a lambo on Friday?
Yes my wages are devaluing in fiat but there very very likely (at least compared to bitcoin) going to stay static enough for me to cover my bills.
I'm a believer in bitcoin and invest in ut but I'd Never put more into it than I'm willing to lose.
@_date: 2019-07-10 10:17:52
Just say youre 98% sure bitcoin is a winner, but the odds would have to be 100% for me to risk my home. 
If I flipped a coin twenty times I'm pretty sure it'll come up heads at least once. Would I bet my house on it? Not a fucking chance.
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:53:48
I'd like to know this too, I definitely have my private key but not sure if I have my 24 word pass code anymore (talking about a small amount of playing around money but would still be good to know.

Bullshit. They get a 2.7/10 on trustpilot. Even shit companies can scrape a 6 or 7.

@_date: 2019-07-10 13:19:28
Err, it doesn't mean 95% at all.

I have a piece of paper. One side has public key and the other side has private key. Perhaps I should take a copy of it and hide it. :)
I'm only talking pocket money so don't think it's worth getting a ledger nano yet.
@_date: 2019-07-31 12:16:09
Yes....... Or no...... Statistically it is always more likely to go up than down which means that statistically its always better to buy than sell.
My advice would be buy (ideally with dollar cost averaging) and don't anticipate selling for at least a few years.
Unless you've got enough invested to manipulate markets this is the easiest, safest method. Everything else is just guesswork.
@_date: 2019-07-31 12:29:27
No worries. Just buy it, set yourself up for a regular purchase every week or month. Come back in 2022 and check how much its worth.
I know it's easier said than done but try not to waste your time checking the price every few hours. It isn't going to change anything and trying to guess the market is more likely to reward you with failure rather than success :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:53:50
Sent it to my paper wallet and paid another fee! Argh!
Paid £51.50, basically received £31 worth of bitcoin.

I'm in the uk so have less than two hours until the end of the day and I reckon I'll see it :)

I'm no expert but I use bittylicious. Easy to set up, fair prices and gets good reviews. Others may have a better idea though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:16:08
I was going to buy about an hour ago but the fees were about 30% so stopped.
I'm now trying to register with coin base/gdax but it's like trying to herd cats lol

Or end of today 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:28:55
Seriously, just HODL. The Bitcoin market is currently proving again and again that Hodling returns a substantially large profit gain. Don't open yourself up to getting burnt.

Got to be a tesla. Then you can continue to watch that sweet bitcoin grow on that big central ipad thing they have ;).
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:47:54
What happened last time? Genuine question, did the price rocket, did it go up a little, did it stay the same?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:38:39
Yep I'm aware of that :) 
Are we expecting it to calm down soon, is it likely that localbitcoin will keep there doors closed indefinitely?
Tempted to sit it out until 'futures' events blow over. But if there's one thing bitcoin shows time and time again is that 
'you've got to be in it, to win it'
 lol

@_date: 2017-12-04 17:52:04
Not really sure what your concerns are.  Bitcoin has consistently proven itself to be a licence to print money. One day it won't be, but for now you can't be surprised that people are investing their own money into something that is offering such good returns. I wouldn't be suprised if 90% of bitcoin holders didn't come here to make a quick buck, but then decided to stay.
I'm invested in bitcoin, I believe in it, I read about it, I have every faith in it, but when I put my first bit of cash in it I just wanted a quick buck. TBH it's made no difference to my bitcoin value or yours how people perceive it.

@_date: 2017-12-03 07:47:26
Thanks a lot for the reply, I appreciate it. I'll be looking at getting a hardware wallet in the future, but at the moment I'm working with such a small amount of money I can't really justify it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:41:42
Changed to paper a few days ago. Once it's up and running again you should do the same (or an alternative wallet).
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:28:22
I put £150 in 7-8 weeks ago and it's more than doubled (pretty close to trebled really). Of course it's worth it. Obviously don't put any more in than you're willing to lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:17:17
No problem I'm a beginner too. Just got to the 'paper wallet' stage so know it can be a little nerve racking
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:20:23
Good for you bro. You only win if you see the returns :)
I put £150 in last month, considering jumping ship now I'm at £320 lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:06:12
Haha. It's hardly a crash. It's about the same worth as this time last week!
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:30:56
I know nothing, very new to this, but does currency not already do this? Inflation has always tended to have an upward trend (as long as nothing drastic happens). Suppose what bitcoin needs to do is to go to a 1-2% inflation rate eventually, rather than the negative inflation (deflation) we're currently seeing.
Like I say, I'm a moron, and don't know what I'm talking about, and am also interested to learn, but paper currency certainly isn't immune to deflation/inflation problems.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:44:40
Nothing wrong with it but there are better/safer ways to store your bitcoin.
Personally if it's just a couple hundred bucks/pounds/euros leave it in coinbase till you get the hang of it, next step would likely be use a paper wallet. If you're starting to hodl a thousand £/€/$ then consider investing in a hardware wallet.
Blockchain are fine but your investment is at a higher risk compared to other wallets, and the fees (although not extortionate) can be bettered elsewhere.

On my log in page it asks me to provide photos of my driving license or passport, which I have done.  On the website it's easy to see what stage of registering you are at.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:02:01
So close! Midnight and it's 19995.5 on coinbase lol. That'll do :)

Fuck me, There's a lot more to friendship than financial health! Just because you have differing views on what to do with your savings/investments shouldnt mean you cease being friends.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:53:17
My guess is 8k ( and I'll buy some more) :)
@_date: 2019-06-21 07:01:44
Thanks for all the replies everyone. Guess there isn't a simple answer and it'll need a bit of setting up. Which I'm happy to do.
Now I'll see if I can find a way of getting this 'unspendable' amount I've already got. Just checked the app (blockchain) and its £247.
 (I thought it was only £20-30 but obviously this was a couple of years ago lol.
I reckon once bitcoin gets even simpler (so idiots like me don't struggle) bitcoin will get stratospheric.
@_date: 2019-06-21 07:48:15

In my experience (which isnt much lol) the highs are always higher than expected and the lows are always lower. 
I'm also looking in £'s not $ so it's not actually that far for me. We' re already down to about £9,900
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:22:45
I'd really like some advice on this too.
I've £200ish in blockchain wallet so don't really want to spend £100 on an alternative walket
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:59:51
Still on blockchain.info.   Not too fussed about it being on there at the minute but once I'm creeping up towards £500 (which I'm sure is a laughable amount to most on here) I'd rather it was more secure.
For every different type of wallet there seems to be pros and cons so it's hard to decide which way to go :)

Not will it make the papers? Not sure but It seems that the press (at least in the uk) are starting to view it positively which can only help. Also The Big Bang Theory episode this week will surely help.

I honestly think that if my amount became significant, I'd take the money and run. Suppose one mans significant amount is another mans pocketmoney.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:47:03
How do these machines actually work? Do they print out a little paper wallet that can be stored at home or do you use the screen to transfer it to another wallet? Do they have ridiculous fees (like many corner shop atms)? 
Is there a practical reason why you'd choose to use this rather than buying online?
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:58:03
Jeremy vines interview style tends to be extremely negative and argumentative. The so called "experts" tend to be nothing like experts.
Prepare to get the urge to put your foot through the radio lol.
On the other side of the coin Bitcoin was in the 'most read' area of BBC News this morning with a fairly positive write up.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:53:29
Seriously, after reading your post the last thing you want to do is put a significant amount of money into bitcoin. The stress will upset you more than its worth.
Put a little into it (dollar averaging long term preferably) an amount that you can handle losing. Enjoy the rides up and don't stress the rides down.
DON'T INVEST SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF YOUR INHERITANCE ON SOMETHING VOLATILE THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
peace x
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:33:56
I've put 3x£50 in since November 1st. I'll probably continue to put a £50 in every couple of weeks as I can handle losing that comfortably. 
Anymore than that and I'll find it too stressful lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:39:39
First thing to do is tell your wife. It's savings so I'm assuming it's not going to make you homeless or anything. Plenty of people make mistakes, but don't make it worse by trying to chase it back through cryptos/investments. In five years time it'll be a blip in your family's history.
What actually happened? Has you're portfolio gone to zero? Do you still have money in crypto? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:20:13
