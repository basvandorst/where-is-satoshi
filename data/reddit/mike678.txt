pretty sure some one scalped them and is planning on putting them on ebay. There is no way newegg sold out in less then 10 minutes.

I wrote this on the other thread you posted but I think it needs to be said here as well.
I would like to point out at current difficulty and at 20 a btc you will break about even on the 1 gHash contract as for selling the mining rigs I feel like you are getting too much of a profit. If your profits were slimmer on the mining rigs maybe it could be worth it for the computer illiterate. In my opinion none of your services are worth it.

I sold 50 bitcoins the other day I got mining around 2 years ago. It was mostly to cover the cost of the mining rig. I'm sure many others are doing the same.

I'm just saying things would have to go catastrophically wrong within the time he recovers his wallet. I'm not saying its not possible to happen but I highly doubt there will be a 93% drop in the next month which should be more then enough time to recover said files. Though it doesn't really matter because he found his wallet anyway.

My friend derped around with bitcoins when it first came out. He used a cpu to mine and managed to get 200 btc in around 3 days before he got bored. He ended up selling them for around $20 a btc in 2011. So casual mining can easily get you 500 btc.
edit: Not exactly sure why I was downvoted but whatever. If you started early enough you could have casually mined and then forgot about it for a couple years.

Bitcoins would have to collapse for him to just break even. It would need to be 12 dollars per btc which is a 93% drop. Even back in 2011 it took a month to reach a 50% drop and bitcoins is in quite better light then back then.
