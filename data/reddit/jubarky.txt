Interesting response to my op. Ironic you go around calling people fragile when one sentence triggered you. I think at the time of this post I was observing the price fall down like $500 or whatever the case is I don’t spend my days watching the price or lurking around reddit as you can surmise from my late response cause you know, I have a life unlike you. But keep fanboy shilling, you don’t have to go around exposing your insecurities to everyone. Cheeze calm your tits. Fragile idiot trololol

Sorry guys. Bitcoin won’t be going anywhere above $7700 (my buy in price) until I sell. My luck is insidious.

Slowly bleeding out, gross.
