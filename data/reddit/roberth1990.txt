Anarchism will never work, just forget it. It's even more unrealistic than communism. Chaos will simply never work.

No it doesn't mean chaos, but chaos is the inevetable consequence.

What kind of violence are talking about? Police brutality? That's really rare here in Norway. Sure them getting away with it is a kind of corruption, but how does you police act less corrupt and less brutal without a government? Lobbying is illegal here in norway, sure it happens under the table, I find it hard to believe that is as big a problem here compared to the us judging from what your polticians are doing. Corporation would just create their own laws without a government and pay the police to protect them.

I get arrested and fined. There is no violence involved.

How is decentralized power going to work?

I'd like to see some source on that "The military-industrial complex is government writ large.".
And at the same time private prisons have become more and more the norm.
Sure drugs should be treated as a medical problem, but how is society suposed to do that better than the government?

I want actual statistics and figures.


In a previous comment you said the government is getting bigger by doing drug war. Now you are just contradicting your self.

Vigilante justice works bad.
And your example of a man arresting and locking in his wife for not doing the dishes is something you are making possible by your logic.
This discussion is over, I gave you a chance to make sense of yoru views but you failed misserably.

Here you aren't put in cuffs if you don't resist when you are arrested for such crimes, and you are put into a room here. If you are resisting over a plant you are a fucking idiot.


You are fucking retarded.
So people that are murderers, rapists and other violent individuals shouldn't be arrested because that would be violence?
Stop using laws that a lot of people disagree with to try to make all laws to be useless. That's fucking retarded.

How is society going to be healthy?
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:33:50
Yeah because opening things up to even more corruption solves soooooo much. And again USA != the world. So your notion is absurd, because you americans act you are the only country in the world.
@_date: 2015-03-24 02:21:05
Is tax evasion a good thing?
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:55:45
How is reducing government going to make the society healthy?
Reducing government have you been doing decades, doesn't seem to be doing much positive.
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:00:47
USA != the world first of all.
Anyways, even if they are corrupt, we are fucked without them, because they aren't *that* corrupt, sure if you live in large parts of africa etc, you would be more right, but if you take my country as an example, which is Norway, your argument would be completely invalid, because here the government is nowhere near as corrupt as the american government.
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:37:43
Sure and who is going to stop people from paying extra money under the table to let police just turn a blind eye to their crime which isn't good for society? Sure the problem exists now, but I can't see how that is going to be solved by removing absolutely ever obstacle they are facing in todays society.
@_date: 2015-03-24 19:04:53
None of those things are met with violence. You don't understand what violence is. What you are saying makes absolutely no sense.
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:16:02
I have no anger. I live in a country which isn't as fucked up and backwards as the US, sure your country will collapse because education is allowed to just be more and more and more expensive etc, but in my country we don't have that problem.
@_date: 2015-03-24 02:54:16
So if a society collapses it is a good thing?
@_date: 2015-03-24 02:21:42
Not much has changed since then.
@_date: 2015-03-24 04:06:13
How has government grown? Everything I can see that has happend has been deregulation and privatization. Any example of the opposite?
And what do mean with sickness?
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:06:01
How is police and military going to work without a government?
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:29:20
Sure, but how is society going run police for example without a government.
