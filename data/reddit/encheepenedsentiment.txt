I had two different lightbulb moments.
I read the bitcoin paper in 2009. I was impressed by how it used proof-of-work to maintain a transaction ledger, and I recognized that it could provide something that acts like currency.  But, at the time i didn't that the currency would ever have big value---in other words, I expected dogecoin instead of bitcoin.  Derp.
My second lightbulb moment was when bitcoin reached $12---about a thousand times higher than I thought it ever could.

Can someone please explain the relationship between multisignature wallets and pay-to-script-hash (p2sh)? My confusion stems from these two sources.
One source made me think you need p2sh to perform a multisig transaction:  Note that the multisig address begins with a 3, like p2sh addresses.
However, someone else corrected me and said you don't need p2sh for multisig: 
So what's the verdict? Is p2sh just a means to simplify multisig?  If p2sh is not necessary for multisig, then what is p2sh used for?

Not everyone wants to link their bank account with some company.  That is analogous to giving them the private key to your wallet---once you give them access to your bank account, it's difficult to "un give" access.  If something goes wrong, you have to fall back to your bank's fraud division to correct it. Although safeguards exist, I'm sure they're a PITA for all involved.
A careful agent would avoid this situation in order to minimize their personal risk.
Remember: for every big player, like CoinBase, who seem trustworthy, there are others, like Neo&amp;Bee or MtGox, who seemed trustworthy at the time.
I think ATMs and in-person exchanges allow both parties to limit their risk.  However, the issue of scalability remains.

Exchanges? Up to this point, I have opined nothing about exchanges.
I agree with your earlier statement that the whitepaper has nothing to do with exchanges:


And as I said earlier,


So let me make it very simple:
1. multisig is good for many reasons. I think you and I agree on that.
2. the whitepaper calls for distributing privkeys among trusted 'administrative agents.'
3. you need to provide a compelling reason before I trust a third party to hold a privkey, even if it's only one of several privkeys in a multisig.
4. without a use case, the whitepaper does not offer a compelling reason to release privkeys to third parties.
5. Thus, I rebuke the whitepaper.
Also, I need to address this:


You comments thus far include a very passive-agressive rhetorical subtext.  First you imagine some 'strong psychological association', and now talking about my 'personal' interpretation.  You can agree or disagree with my interpretation (preferably using reason) but don't try to dismiss it by calling it 'personal.'

Just read the paper.  This is really cool because it provides m-of-n signatures to coins which do not support p2sh.
Why does that matter?
It would allow you to create a cryptocurrency exchange without forcing users to deposit funds with the exchange.
Normal CC exchanges escrow both sides of the trade. They use a naive method (deposit into the exchsnge's coffers) where you have to trust their accounting and that they won't get hacked or rob you.
2/3 multisig escrow almost solves this, except bitcoin-proper is the only coin that supports p2sh.  IIRC no/few altcoins have enabled p2sh, and thus do not support 2/3 multisig escrow.
If users A and B want to exchange currencies X and Y, the exchange helps them create two 2/3 threshhold wallets.  Each user deposits their half of the trade into the respective wallet.  Only after all funds have been escrowed will the exchange do their part in releasing the funds.
Very cool.

To computer scientists, "virtual" has the connotation of "not physical" in the sense of "indirectly referring to something physical or concrete."
For example, "virtual memory" is a means to swap physical memory.  A "virtual address space" maps memory addresses visible to a running program to physical addresses that have meaning to the hardware.  A "virtual machine" provides the illusion that each guest operating system has exclusive access to the physical hardware.  In programming languages, a "virtual function call" binds, at runtime, to an indirectly specified procedure.  In a compiler's intermediate representation, instructions employ an unbounded number of "virtual registers" which will be lowered to machine registers...
Compare to computer science's use of "logical," as in "logical address."
Since bitcoin has no backing, I agree we should avoid the term "virtual currency."

As I read the whitepaper, these are inseparable. At the heart of the whitepaper is the assumption that a client wishes to delegate key management.  Quote the whitepaper,


I reacted to the (imho, bad) idea of introducing trusted parties to a system which works fine without them.
And let me clarify a few points so you and I can be friendly going forward:
I was thinking of only one use case: storage of coins. I wasn't talking about exchanges at all.
By "accusation" I meant the accusation that I had not read the whitepaper before criticizing it.
I admit I should have written a wordier, more precise initial analysis (even though the whitepaper dedicated only 3 sentences to analysis).

2/3 multisig paper wallet. It combines the strengths of a paper wallet (cold storage, not reachable by malware) with the fault tolerance and double-checking of 2/3 escrow.
Generate 3 keypairs, print them, and store them in three different secure locations (e.g. home safe, bank safe deposit box, &amp; safe at wotk).  Don't leave a trace of them on a computer.
Use the three pubkeys to create a 2/3 multisig address and deposit your coins into it.
Even if your home burns down, you can still retrieve the other two keys so you can still spend your funds (into a new 2/3 multisig paper).
Even if your home is robbed, the thief would also need to rob your office or bank to withdraw.

"Idiot" and "not interested in tech minutiae" are not synonyms.  Doctors, lawyers, managers, and financiers are (usually) not idiots, but few could satisfactorily explain how a cell phone works.  Even if they are capable of understanding, that doesn't mean they want to budget their precious time to learning technical details which (honestly) don't matter any more than how a credit card transaction works.
Personally, I think that bitcoin is not yet mainstream, so 'for dummies' exposure is still valuable publicity.  Also, I believe that people who are curious already have very many high-quality resources explaining the details of bitcoin (only a google search away!)

Yeah.  You could shift, for instance, from an income tax to a sales tax. That way you penalize the people who spend most of their income (the poor) and benefit the people who save their income (the rich).
My point is, by restricting the variety of actions available to a government, you're forcing all governments to use the same least-common-denomination tax scheme. No longer does the variety of nations offer a variety of political structures.  The net effect would be the same minimal government in every state.
I like the idea that some states could choose big government and others could choose small government. The people could choose which state to be citizen of.  But eliminating citizenship does not provide me with choice.


Sigh. Debt is a tool. Sometimes it makes sense for an individual/corporation/state to trade money for time, i.e. take a loan.  For example, it let's many people purchase a home before the age of 65, instead of renting until they've saved enough to buy in cash. If you think it never makes sense for a person/corporation/state to take a loan, you are a fool.

One important aspect of a paper wallet is ***cold*** storage, i.e. the private key never enters an internet-connected computer until you withdraw funds from that wallet, and after that point you never use that paper wallet again.  As soon as the private key is revealed to an internet-connected computer you assume that it may have been compromised.

If you said you wanted to eliminate the state, I probably would have accepted that and walked away.  But it's a joke to pretend that eliminating citizenship is different than a single world government.
Some governments choose to give benefits (such as roads, utilities, police, schools, courts, fire departments) to their citizens.  These are paid by taxes.  Everyone benefits, even non tax payers who happen to be within jurisdiction. Without citizenship, those who receive government benefits would leave the country before they had to pay taxes for those services.  This happened to Detroit---because Detroit has residents but cannot have citizens, so it could not force those who incurred the city's large debt to stay and pay for it.  Instead they moved just outside the Detroit border.
Consequently, each nation would offer only those minimal services for which a toll could be immediately collected. All nations would race to provide the fewest services. The world would be divided into indistinguishable, shitty little states. Your proposed non-citizens would be free to select but would have no choice.
Without citizenship, how could democracy work?  Should a state let anyone vote?  Should a state accept roving bands of voter-gypsies who visit every nation's polls yet reside in none?
Finally, let me point out that your article confuses citizenship with place of birth. In fact only 5 countries grant citizenship to those born within their borders: canada, usa, mexico, costa rica, and brazil. Elsewhere citizenship is an inherited status.

The internet is more decentralized than not, even though the design has a few centralized warts.  I can run my own web/email/whatevs server without permission from a central authority.
The warts are few: who controls DNS roots? Which CAs are default trusted by popular browsers? etc.
The beautiful thing is that blockchain technologies are being applied to each of these centralization problems.  Namecoin fixes DNS; Google's certificate transparency project fixes certificate authorities; etc.

The layout (I.e. margins, font, etc) are the default stylesheet for LaTeX. Pretty standard for any academic working in math, physics, or compsci.
Throughout the paper, double quotes are mismatched (I.e. author typed " and " instead of `` and ''). This suggests that the author was not good at using latex.

His comments don't completely make sense. In what way is bitcoin **not** a reliable medium of exchange **today**? I'll grant that bitcoin is not a stable store of value, but its use as medium of exchange is well undeniable.
Why should I be excited about this?  A large, established bank announces that they want to be an intetmediary. It would be a different story if they announced that they would add value... This, however, sounds like they want to make themselves a part of other people's transactions---traditional market thinking.

That is helpful, thanks. 
So am I correct to assume: counterparty does not provide any technological means to simplify that trust problem. 
Or said another way, it's still buyer beware despite claims that counterparty is a "trustless exchange"

there's nothing more secure about this. they're trying to position themselves as middlemen.
If you want more secure storage, look into multisig wallets.

Edit: I though you were saying that the compiler would verify it's input; I see now that you meant to use an optimizing compiler as a lower bound on the size/complexity of software that can be verified formally today. My bad.


That doesn't mean what you think it does.
Formally verified compilers (CompCert) are compilers that have a formal proof of correct compiler behavior.  Specifically, if compcert emits code, that code is semantically equivalent to the input source code.
These guarantees say nothing about whether the compiler's input (bitcoin source code) is correct.

Consider first that I posted before you provided a source. Your source should have been in the original post, not in the comments.
Next, consider that many people do not consider russia today a reliable source.  Even among RT stories, this one sounded a bit like an editorial...
But now that we have a source, the source itself raises the same issue that I did about FBI jurisdiction vs Lakota sovereignty.
Finally, let me add that the market cap of maza is 285k USD.  That is tiny when compared to BTC's 5G USD (source: coinmarketcap.com, accessed just now). 
So what if the entire mazacoin market cap were liquidated into USD, and then thrown at the BTC/USD market to dump prices?  I don't have enough data to say definitively, but I can point out that 285k is less than 1% of the 24-hour BTC/USD trade volume, which is 46M (source: coinmarketcap.com, accessed just now).
So no, friend, I was not trolling... We disagree, but that is not what 'trolling' means.

No, they don't. Most people have no idea how email, web sites, cell phones, or even cars work, yet these technologies are used every day.
If you try to explain technology to them, their eyes gloss over and they anxiously look for a polite excusr to walk away.
If people simply understand "you can own bitcoin, and you can spend it, but you cannot spend it twice" I think that is sufficient.

If I didn't live in USA, I would probably buy a lot.
But here, my choices include: pay at least 50% above market rate on localbitcoins, or surrender personally identifying information to a sketchy exchange (who will lose my info in an epic security breach).
So I guess I have to sit the bench on this opportunity, just like the last opportunity.

Although it's clear that catwelder has some anger for coinbase (just like I don't like btc-e), there is nothing but circumstantial evidence that he is the leaker.
It doesn't matter **who** leaked the coinbase user list, and it doesn't matter **why**.
For now, let's wait for a coinbase response and halt this silly witch hunt.
