No, he's a kid because he's in his mid twenties and will spend the next 60+ years rotting away in a cell while our tax dollars pay to feed him. He'll never see his parents without chains on. Seriously dude?
That's the success you wanted? *That's* your justice?

He tried to have people killed that wanted him dead. You play the game, you roll with the punches.
People molest children and get no jail time. People commit *multiple murders* (actual, real murders mind you, not fake bullshit scams, people lose their lives) and get less jailtime than Ross.
Ross deserves to be in jail, he broke the law, but putting him in for *the rest of his fucking life* is absolutely absurd. If you think taking the life away from this kid protects anyone - solves ANY problems with the real world - you have a fucked up view on life.

Yeah, I'm shocked how many people are okay with this, honestly. Worldwide CP ring uncovered? The head of FIFA? Hell, the big thing everyone's talking about, cops? Nobody's getting punished... but sending a kid away for life is okay to people. Insane.

That's a joke and you know it. He wouldn't have tried to have people killed if the feds didn't feed him fake info about fake people so they could commit fake hits. Not only that, he sold a small, *small* amount of psychedelic mushrooms... and never sold another drug, ever.
Not saying he shouldn't be in jail, but it's pretty sad that I could walk outside, brutally murder a couple people, and have less jail time than him. It's unjust and unwarranted. The judge was appointed by Chuck Schumer, wanted to set a precedent and has a hard on for extreme sentences. He couldn't even provide a defense.
Yet this is what people are calling a "just" ending.
