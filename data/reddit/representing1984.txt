What did you do for the redeemable part? Thanks for the info
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:14:17
LOL Pretty much
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:24:16
Brilliant.  I'm in for one.  Send me one or give me your address for Trick-or-Treating... lol     
I'd also be interested in doing this myself.  Do you have a link for where I could get the chocolates?
@_date: 2018-10-30 14:25:29
It will improve

Dumb. Guy made an awesome return on a small investment when Bitcoin was super sketchy.  Very tough to purchase back in the initial period as well.  Could have also lost or had his coin stolen in the numerous hacks and thefts as well, unless he literally put it in cold storage and just forgot about it.  It's endlessly pointless to look back ten years ago and say "why didn't I invest in x". You can do it for so many things. But how many investments also go bust or lose money? A lot.  Not to mention BTC only continues to go up in price because some of us spend it, and continue to buy and sell.

Do not deposit.  It is 100% a scam

Well, if you're getting a letter that says you owe, guess what? You owe.  So if you have any assets, like own a home or have a bank account, then you will need to get a lawyer to defend that you "don't actually owe any taxes.". Even if you don't have any assets at all, it's stupid to ignore because if you do come into some assets in the next few years, they might pursue that tax (plus interest) much more aggressive
@_date: 2019-08-17 00:46:42
Exactly. Not too mention that anyone even a small amount (like over $3k) is breaking the law. A license is required
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:32:12
Not really
@_date: 2019-08-17 00:49:04
You must not own any property or have any money in the USA.  Just saying, they can tax whatever they want and will come after your assets. Cheaper to pay the tax most the time than get a lawyer to defend against a capital gains tax on bitcoin.

Just the obvious things that make it a scam or should raise red flags:
1.) watch the chat.  It's a loop and non-sense.  if you don't believe me, just watch and it's the same bullshit over and over and no users will respond to you
2.) Support will not respond
3.) anything you need to deposit before cashing out is an automatic red flag
4.) the english is shit
5.) there is no gaming license
6.) they are offering free money
7.) if it has a part that tells you how many users are logged in, it's always the same or very close to the same number
8.) each "game" is about the same amount, which just isn't possible.   Also, the names of the people that are participating are in a loop

Sorry to tell you but I received 8.5 BTC, so I guess you are now just the pathetic troll.  DyatAss is a fitting name for someone who no doubt does not get one bit off ass.  Life is full of jealous, spiteful, people like you all.   Lots of decent folks out there looking for quality investments. Nothing to do with begging, since I offered a solid business with return 
But, Enjoy, must have been really tough  digging for that deeeeep response.
@_date: 2019-10-31 18:35:46
Waaa Waaa.
@_date: 2019-08-12 18:26:36
I was saying posting this as a "reminder" or "warning" is dumb.  This guy absolutely did the right thing.  It's dumb to think that you would have held Bitcoin all this time.  The only way that would have happened is if you completely forgot about it, somehow.  If you made money, you're in the elite.
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:35:05
Not likely, since he made money.  Did you kill yourself for not buying bitcoin 9 years ago or for not buying Amazon stock 15 years ago?  Dumb to even think about times you didn't make money by investing, looking back ten years ago... You could do this endlessly
@_date: 2019-08-17 00:56:31
I don't get how non-Americans comment about taxes in the USA.  It's illegal to not report tips and most do report, "not some". Even if I agreed that most don't pay taxes, You're also talking about a very small income population, in the service industry, and income tax really isn't the thing that most people complain when it comes to taxes. It's more property taxes, sales tax, capital gains tax, as these are you endless and double or triple taxing in some instances. I could care less about income tax, but the income I invest is then taxed, the income I make is then taxed again when I buy something--even if it's something like a 15 year old car that's been taxes 3 or 4 times during sales.
@_date: 2019-08-12 10:59:54
[btcroll.pro]( is also a scam

I bet the gay sex for DyatAss is unlimited, unlike the money people make. ��
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:00:27
Good points. Aren't you an overall loser though if you've bought in each week for say $500?
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:54:13
So basic inflation �� 
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:30:10
A modern car sure. A stingray is going to appreciate in value over the next 3 decades
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:47:00
Or at least the sub $2000 range where it's going
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:43:46
Bitcoin is not the future. BTC touts are disgusting. It's the biggest manipulated market I've ever witnessed. It's future and forks and rules are controlled by miners in China.  These billionaires touting, are concerned about the general public? Oh right... 
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:10:35
Why do the number of addresses matter? If I send a dollar with electrum, I've often got 2 or 3 change addresses... 
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:13:53
 sure, or how about you cut your losses and reinvest at a better price
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:56:52
Who would be panicking if you spent 18 million and it's currently worth 1.5 billion.......

Get out now, if you haven't already. The bottom is a long way away in my opinion. &lt;$1000 in the next 6 months.
Bitcoin suffers from energy mining problems to truly be a store of value. It literally takes over 700kWH to confirm one transaction (I use 400kwh a month at my home). 
As much as I love bitcoin, it never should have gone over $1000 a coin. It's acceptance has hardly increased in anything mainstream. If I wasn't into gambling, bitcoin would have no direct use for me. 
Ultimately, no one is going to avoid government regulation or the simple fact that anything of meaning ( house, car, paying for health insurance) is going to have to be done in fiat currency.  Maybe if you live in Venezuela, you will have spending power with BTC. But, other than that, the bubble has popped on BTC and will continue to deflate for some time. The 100s of altcoins, also don't help BTC. Speaking from the USA, what is ultimately the positive of BTC? If I want to sell Bitcoin for USD, I've got to use a regulated exchange and I'm either taxed for short term gains or you're subject to 15% capital gains tax (over a year). If you sell bitcoin on the side, in person or using another money transfer service, you're committing a felony.  People are being charged for this crime. 
If you're holding a coin or two, you're just foolish because you have zero effect on the market. You should be selling right now and counting your blessings. 
I have only been able to use Bitcoin to buy Proton services or to fund my sportsbook, so why is it still held so high for some people? I'd be curious to know what you've been able to actually buy, using bitcoin directly.  And even then, aren't most of the people who take bitcoin still converting it right to fiat? 
Goodluck to holders, but ultimately I am always laugh at people saying it's going to hit 20k again, or the people who say it's going to 100k.  The only way it does that is through shady tactics, and isn't it "proof" enough that's its got the structure of the smartest Ponzi scheme in that everytime it hits a high, it basically losses 90% of its value and then this cycle seems to repeat again and again.. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:51:47
Get out now. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:40:28
But it's not a store of value. Yes it has increased if you bought at one certain time. However, if you continued to buy bitcoin every week, you'd be a loser. Also, the amount of energy required to send bitcoin is overlooked and it is only increasing. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:55:13
Lol. 999999 out of 1000000 people's whole bitcoin stash, if burned, would have no effect. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:12:27
Yes. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:11:56
Okay, so you made my point. 1% adoption rate on something that uses enough energy to power +6 million homes each day.  1% adoption rate even after massive gains. 1% adoption rate because 99% of the population isn't willing to take the risks associated with crypto or bitcoin, where 85% of bitcoins are held by less than 1% of the addresses
Very doubtful my "lack of vision" will be anything I pay for. I bought in sub $100, so I'm not paying for anything. Current price is super inflated.
Goodluck getting your money back. And Goodluck touting
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:38:38
Isn't sportsbook funding the biggest spending of Bitcoin? I've literally sent and received over 10 million USD equivalent from books.
What else can you realistically buy of value in the USA? Anyone actually ever buy a house, car, groceries directly with BTC?
I have used bitcoin to buy small things like my ProtonVPN or Proton Email but I have never been offered the option to directly use Bitcoin except at dark markets and for betting sports /casino 
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:31:22
Did you actual use BTC? Or did you sell BTC to AUS$ and then buy?  I'm not sure why people overlook how important that distinction is
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:53:34
Exactly most people saying they have a few hundred dollars or thousands... Anything under a couple hundred thousand dollars and it's chump change. Remember real holders have significant holdings (100s of btc) because they purchased when the price was in single or double digits.
I'd love to see the actual inequality of bitcoin holdings. I wouldn't hesitate a guess that 80% or more of bitcoin is held by a handful or two of people. 
If you hold your 10 coins or sell them, it will make no difference in this market. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:53:19
Well, any exchange will let you sell that. 
Actually transferring USD to your personal account  will have limits based on where your KYC and exchange. But, if you actually have USD in a regulated exchange, who cares if it takes a year or two to transfer 1.5 billion usd$?
