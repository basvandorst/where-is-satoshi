@_date: 2017-12-06 18:12:03
I see. So the basic idea is to move your bitcoins away from their current private keys so on the BTC chain the balance is 0. Then expose those keys to a BCC wallet (where the balance will still be unchanged)?

Another usage that others here have not yet mentioned is securing an online/web wallet.
With this (or something very similar) we can issue bitcoin transactions that require 2 out of 3 particular private keys. Consider private keys A, B and C.
A is my backup key, offline, paper, in a vault under my house or safe deposit box.
B is my key, i keep it wherever is convenient but reasonably secure.
C is held by the online wallet, they make online transactions easier and provide security for me (perhaps even insurance?)
When making a purchase, i can provide key B and the online service provides C, we can make a transaction. (perhaps my key is just in a chrome extension)
In order to steal my coins you have to get 2 of these 3 keys. Hack me and the online wallet, the wallet and my vault or the vault and me.
If the online wallet gets shut down or hacked or just goes out of business I can still retrieve my coins with keys A and B.

Well, it sort of can, we have to reach consensus before we can actually ship anything. The  blockchain adds the ability to do so automatically and  *without having to trust anyone.* No Linus, no BDFL etc.

Yes and then the blockchain would show the correct balance on their addresses. So either 750k all in one block or over a long period where they knew it was happening.

The bitcoins are instantly theirs. However it isn't safe to spend again until you have at least one confirmation. 6 conf isn't strictly necessary but is safer for large amounts.  This is because it becomes increasingly difficult to perform double spend with more confirmations.

The other problems I don't really feel like speaking to but  has been bothering me for a long long time.
Why does every one compare confirmation times to CC processing times?
This is really a nonsensical comparison or even a strawman. Bitcoin is much *much* faster than traditional payment methods.
When i get 1 confirmation for a transaction *i have that money*. That is 10 minutes and the bitcoins are **mine** almost irrevocably. 
This is not true with CC/debit cards...you are looking at days if not a week.
Technically if you count chargebacks you are looking at months.
CC processing compares more to the transaction propagating across the network to your node. This is good enough for most retail transactions. When was the last time you were in and out, swipe and go for something that was even mildly expensive?
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:43:12
perhaps some sort of verification flair? sign a message from an address

so the buying shares process:
1.   Create a Colored Coin Wallet at

3.   Send Bitcoins from your Colored Coin Wallet to 1LzUY9zPp1iSabwr4aUwUezSGe5aC4Wmhh
4.   Wait for shares to be sent to your Colored Coin Wallet.
Um, so i thought (correct me if i'm wrong) one of the big advantages of colored coins is risk free, trustless atomic trades between colored coin and bitcoin via OP_ANYONECANPAY
Why would i just send btc to this address in hopes of getting colored coins in return?

But yeah lets say you do give a key to someone who is trusted and loved. Now they get a wrench too. Awesome.

I think OP meant to "spending unconfirmed inputs"
@_date: 2014-02-17 15:51:18
Well one reason that I know if is the fact that there are cases where we *want* transactions to be malleable
for example there is a transaction OP called ANYONECANPAY.  This allows me to create a transaction with empty inputs and ahve them filled a later date.
One way to use this is if you wanted to trade colored coins for bitcoins. Create a transaction that outputs the colored coin, with ANYONECANPAY inputs. Buyer then fills the inputs. Once that is done the transaction can be valid and broadcasted. In this way the trade can happen atomically. (no risk to either party).
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:01:02
In the future there should exist instruments whereby a merchant such as yourself can store btc and expose themselves to much less volatility. While traders can expose themselves to more volatility on your behalf.

Unfortunately in these situations the provider cannot give us very much specific information on what causes a transaction to be flagged algorithmically.

I know you are presenting these as not necessarily your arguments but ones you have heard, but i must respond. 


This is simply not the case. Bitcoin changes hands extremely easy. It is only difficult to trade for digital fiat. This sort of underscores the improvements bitcoins make over that system. 


Hard to argue, but I think a coinbase account is about as easy to use as a paypal account.


I agree. but this is because it is so damn easy to transfer.


I agree with this. It doesn't have anything to do with bitcoin itself and rather human nature, but true nonetheless.


what? is this the same as the 'stolen very easily?' seems like a duplicate issue.  yes there are scammers and hackers everywhere, that is life.


I honestly dont know how you would do this. I think USD laundering methods are much more well established. They seem like they might work with btc as well. Not sure what the actual currency has to do with anything.


Well i can easily just hand you a paper wallet. Just like cash.




who gives a shit. i dont mine, you dont mine, most people dont mine. (its certainly not impossible)


This is real. But you require a malicious actor with centralized power. This is true of every other currency as well. 


Not sure why a currency would include litigation methods. Why would i not be able to sue for theft?
Just not true. True anonymity is much harder than true transparency


You said this one already (

I am not a computer scientist but from what I can tell Gox is planning on internally tagging transactions with a canonical id (this one is deterministic, and existing ways to mutate transactions will not cause this id to change). 
 In this way, they can verify the transaction they issued has been included in the blockchain even if it was the mutated version that did not originate from them.

I don't get it.
Having a lot of bitcoins/usd does not make you corrupt.
@_date: 2012-01-02 06:26:50
if you mined 1,000 btc when they were $.01 and watched them go past $1 , up to $32, and now sit at $5 and you are still holding them...
You deserve every penny.
Also that's a strawman, nobody claims bitcoin has a 'fair' distribution of coins, that's impossible. Only that it is impartial and immune to the whims of the corrupt (unlike USD)
@_date: 2012-01-29 05:49:22
I think you misunderstand my meaning.
I'm sure you are a fair and objective BIP editor. I'm sure you are kindhearted and an all around swell person.
But you are a person, and you will die.  A dictatorship is the most efficient form of government **if you can guarantee a good dictator**.
You don't think that if bitcoin gained world wide acceptance (and thus an astronomical market cap) that there wouldn't be pressure on people like you?
@_date: 2012-01-29 05:11:50
After all of the crap that I've watched bitcoin go through, my faith in its future has never even faltered the slightest bit until reading this.
Why have i not ever heard of BIPs?
There are 14 already?
All of the sudden instead of bitcoin with its faceless, impartial mechanisms personalities are emerging with tremendous influence on the course of events.
Of course Gavin, but then the BIP editor?. If bitcoin was ever to take hold this is the biggest weakness IMO. A single person who can arbitrarily reject any BIP? Also  so now running the largest mining pool gives you some say in what happens? making you some sort of figurehead. Just because you can run a mining pool?
Also we are supposed to vote on this. And yet apparently there exists no plain English explanation to what the actual fuck any of it means.
I don't know why  feel this way. Apparently i am just naive. It is impossible to have a system like this without people influencing it at some level. And if it is important, and people are involved, we will definitely fuck it up. Greed, pride and ruthlessness will eventually take over.

Ok now that I am thinking about it, it sort of does make sense. You do fill all of the orders from top down, but if you know that that is only a few thousand bids then that is ok..
Place buy at 250k, (0.01)
Place sell at 250k (0.01)
All bids get filled before yours, so you only end up getting 245k from for xfer.

It may help to realize that there are actually no such things as bitcoins.
There are only transactions. Transactions are amounts from one address to another.

This not an online banking portal, where customers log in once or twice a week. This is a currency exchange! "Customers" are constantly logged in, writing bots that hit your servers 24/7. The customers demand high availability and fast response times.

No, a wallet.dat doesn't prove anything about a certain address or what transactions it is capable of, only who owns it.
The block chain is what decides that a certain address is capable of a transaction. The block chain is the public 'ledger'. If you reload an older version of the wallet.dat, the bitcoin network still sees a transaction from your address to another address, therefore you can't spend those bitcoins.

it is about damaging effects to the public perception of bitcoin.

So now you are just being intentionally obtuse. 


Is not stone walling, using `define:word` in google gives you a clear definition, it's the same as referring to a dictionary. He/she even directy linked it.


Directly linking to a definition and showing others how to look up other similar definitions is not a non answer, and since you are not genuinely asking for clarification i think just repeating the answer is fine. Especially since from what I can tell you haven't yet clicked on the original define link.


Please point out where said anyting whatsoever about your character.

Don't know all the details of this attack, but doesn't it seem like this could have been prevented with CSRF tokens? From what i read of the guy that posted here earlier, the attack  didn't use the api but through a form on a phishing site.

yes, that would be $500/btc, and not by citadel, by NITeu whoever that is

That's all well and good, and sounds great. But I'm curious to know more about what he has in mind wrt "rework the protocol around them"
At first glance this sounds like it would be an ugly, hacky band-aid. Unless there's something I'm missing?
Edit: I maybe should clarify that it sounds like any such workaround would remove the word "permissionless" from bitcoin's wonderful list of features

why do so many people insist on comparing transaction verification of CC to transaction *clearing* on btc?

Personally I think that's silly. it is nice that i can send money without a bank. But as far as long term storage of assets, I would totally pay someone to do what OP describes. (just like i do with my USD) why wouldn't I?

You guys are doing a good job in my book, sometimes i wonder if there's actually a concerted smear campaign against you. Anyway keep up the good work. You remain the simplest and easiest way to get started in btc.

No, the above attack only requires 25%, which is why it's called the 25% attack, this article is a little clearer: 
Also, regardless of hashing power required, they are fundamentally different attacks. So maybe read next time instead of just downvoting?
The required hashing power is even mentioned in TFA.

Thanks for the advice. I've posted on their facebook wall. They have responded and said they'd get it resolved, otherwise no change.

1.) For smaller (everyday) purchases 0 conf transaction is fine, double spend is too costly
2.) transaction fees are user defined + there is a "smart" default transaction fee coming soon (tm)

In order to do this you need to be a decentralized USD exchange as well.
If you could move USD in a decentralized fashion...you wouldn't need bitcoin .. (as much)
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:14:06
I guess that makes sense. Being orphaned can cause them to go away/unconfirmed, being brought into the larger chain causes them to come back...
what about `replaced by a different double-spend`?

Yeah that's about as far as I made it in the article.

You can host/run this server yourself, and install whatever paranoid level of security you'd like in front.
The server itself is really just a thin RESTful wrapper around bitcoind

currently to 0.00000001 BTC or 1 hundred millionth of a bitcoin (we call it a 'satoshi')
This is not set in stone, however, and the protocol could be changed to be even smaller.

Pretty cool, I can see a handful of other neat features like recognizing public keys in a webpage allowing you to easily click on them to send money. You could do similar with phone numbers (sms) or email addresses but then you have to do the claim system (how bitcointip does it)
