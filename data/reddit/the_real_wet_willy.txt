I like to look at [this]( before i send any bitcoin.   
It shows a histogram of how many bytes are in the mempool and at what price (satoshi/byte). I can then decide what price ill pay for the speed i want.

Are you sure about this? I know for a mining business you owe income tax on the value of the coin at the time you take possession. Maybe by owning the private keys at the time of the fork means you now took possession? just saying. IANAL

I thought this was a visual analogy to help understand how the tcp/ip/http works. Or the internet in general. Or computers. Or your phone.  
  
**Or how about any technology that you don't understand!**

I meant having two LN wallets. One a hot wallet which is always on and is you main connection to the rest of the LN, and the other is a kind of cold storage LN wallet which only has one channel with your hot wallet so you can completely control it.

My understanding is that a lightning node only need to be online when sending or receiving a payment. If thats the case, then why cant users have a LN hot wallet for daily use as well as a mostly offline LN wallet *which only has one channel to their LN hot wallet*.  
  
They can use the mostly offline LN wallet to hold larger sums on bitcoin safely on LN and can transfer it to their hot wallet as needed. Almost like taking cash out of their sock drawer before they leave the house  
  
This would mitigate the risk of leaving your private keys online as well as that of a bad actor trying to close the channel when the user is offline as the channel with the most funds is controlled only by you.

What if there was a global database of verified addresses that are tied to specific companies. Kinda like dns now.

Thanks! Do I have to consistently use the same accounting method or can i mix and match? Like for my personal wallet ill use whats most efficient but on exchanges and such ill use fifo/lifo.

I think the creator of this documentary would be against bitcoin. Bill Still is against the gold standard because anything scarce can be controlled. Bitcoin is scarce and therefore its liquidity can be controlled.

Which thankfully they wrote down the seed phrase for and restored a new wallet really easily. Can't do that with cash in a regular wallet.
