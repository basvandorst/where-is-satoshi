Good point. But there is a reason why I use their service.
First no commission on trades and I often do some trades on USD.
I used their service for more than 2 months and deposited in a progressive way everything was great till last Friday.

Still no answer from their staff!

They asked me for several docs and give them all. What I don't understand is that they stop answering me after I provided the required documents (been 3 days now). At least they can tell me to provide additional information...

These are the docs/info required after suspension :
1.) 2 forms of ID 
2.) Proof of address (utility bill, lease etc) 
3.) Employer name and address 
4.) Position at company
5.) Purpose of the account 
6.) Estimated monthly activity with Bitreserve
And of course when you sign up you have to submit an ID to become a verified member!
