The main point is this:


That implies if EtherDelta had registered as a national securities exchange or argued for an exemption it would have been ok

I wonder the exact same thing about Blocknet DX. It's about the only true decentralized exchange I know of:
\- open source
\- trades done via trustless atomic swap
\- decentralized order book
\- no hackable smart contracts or fallible proxy tokens
\- user custody of private keys
\- no KYC
\- no user signup
\- no centralized website, trade straight from your wallet
\- established since 2014
Actually 100% working and not vapourware. Yet very little usage. Granted, the alpha versions were buggy, but now those bugs have been ironed out and it has a slick user friendly UI.
Disclaimer: I coded [blockdx.co]( for fun which shows live orders on the Block dex. Also, if people are interested in interoperability between blockchains I am preparing a series of technical articles over at r/InteropProtocols from a coders perspective which I think will show some surprising conclusions about the different solutions out there.

Check out Blocknet if you want a truly decentralised exchange with user custody of private keys, no KYC and no risk of being hacked. At some point they will be supporting Ledger, it's a work in progress. You can check out some live orders on [blockdx.co](
