The FED "prints money" into existence. The increase of the monetary base makes the value of the money already printed less, as it becomes more common. BTC isn't printed or created at nearly the same rate as USD. Do you see how one currency can inflate at a faster rate now?

It can be almost guaranteed that they are not/will not. Banks do not report your deposits/withdrawals to the IRS (over 10k withdrawal they do). It's always up to the citizen to report their own gains.

yes but since you donated it, you should actually receive a tax benefit

It is "age-inappropriate" perhaps only in that it is an advanced concept for someone your age. Now this in no way deserves a zero. This deserves attention in a positive manner. 
Your teacher encouraged writing about "washing the car" or "Cleaning your room", which is obviously extremely primitive and hardly productive in comparison. You are discussing building wealth, if indirectly, for the future of our nation and others. 
It's common for those that don't understand concepts, to demonize them. The great scientist Galileo was put to death by the church for his discovery that planets rotated around the sun. Research it yourself. 
In other words, you are an advanced foward thinker. Your teacher is not. You are being held back from your potential as a student and positive member of society, as seen by your teacher attempting to "dumb down" your level of thinking. 
People will continue to give stupid/terrible advice throughout life. Listen to yourself. Trust your instincts. You're already on the right track.
