You need to download the bitcoin core wallet. Then after it installs, close it. Go to wherever it created a NEW wallet.dat file and replace it with your old one after you backed it up.  Then reopen bitcoin core once the old wallet.dat file is in place. At this point you have a wallet working with your old wallet file. 
Now, you’ll want to check if you have any actual coin in there. You can either wait a very long time for the wallet to sync (I don’t recommend this) or you can search yourself. Using the “receive addresses” go to a block chain explorer (such as blockchain.info) and copy paste each one into the search bar. This will tell you if. There are coins in any of those addresses. If there are, then congrats! And then look up how to get your private keys to export the coins or comment back.

you dont need to wait for it to download, simply open it, close it, replace the wallet.dat it created with your old wallet.dat, then reopen. go to the help tab at the top, the console and then type dumpprivkey [insertwalletaddresshere] and hit enter. this will give you the private key and from there you can just go download a lite wallet like electrum and sweep the keys in

Then you’re not a hodler. This is no worse than the prior 4 or 5 bubbles. This wasn’t even a real crash. It’ll bounce back whether it’s tomorrow or next year who can say. If tonight was too much for you then you’re probably best just staying out. We’re so far from price discovery this is expected volatility.

it wasnt delayed. it dropped minutes after the news hit
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:13:45
You just said you don’t know when the bubble will burst. It might burst at 100,000 and “crash” to 50,000. If that happens then your advice is terrible 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:02:50
They are fundamentally different. In 1998 people *knew* the internet would be a huge, world changing advancement. But you couldnt just go “invest in the internet”, that is: you can’t buy a piece of the internet. Instead, you could buy a piece (stock) in a company that used the internet, like an aol or amazon. However, The success of the internet is NOT the same as success of a few companies on the internet. So when the bubble popped those companies went under and people lost money - but the internet did not go anywhere.
Now, with bitcoin, sure you can go invest in a company using bitcoin like coinbase or whatever, but the fundamental difference is that when you buy an actual bitcoin, you are buying a piece of the network, which wasn’t possible with the internet. So you can believe in the technology and invest in the actual technology instead of just a company using the tech. 
Anyone who compares the .com bubble to bitcoin either did not understand the .com bubble or does not understand bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-10 21:05:45
hard to say. you may have created a brain wallet. you can paste that into the passphrase spot here to generate a public and private key 
then go to a block explorer and paste the PUBLIC key there. if it shows bitcoin then you can access them and that was the answer. if not then its really hard to say and my next move would be to search for wallet.dat. this might be the password to open the core wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:10:47
Futures will DECREASE volatility by all accounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:56:44
Right, and this position is wrong. You can, right now, convert bitcoin to USD on GDAX for 0 dollars and then withdrawal from GDAX for 0 dollars and buy whatever you want with cash, and pay 0 dollars in fees because they accept the fees because they do batch transfers out of their hot wallet. You pay only capital gains on the difference between base and pull prices. (If you don’t have coins in Gdax then you will have to pay a fee to get them into Gdax)
If you, as you suggest, go take your bitcoin and buy a Tesla by sending the bitcoin to their wallet address (which requires a wallet counter to what OP said) then you pay a transaction fee for wallet to wallet transfer, and the IRS says you still must pay capital gains even though you never held USD. This is, at best, no cheaper than using conventional methods and at worst both more expensive and non trust less. 
Edit: also virtually all companies using crypto, especially high dollar items, don’t even use the cheapest method, they effectively use a coin base or similar company and sell your btc for usd and incur an additional fee there. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:12:43

it was actually "down" for a few minutes and allowing sells but not buys, which crashed the price. should come back now that buying is re-enabled
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:04:36
Search your computer/storage devices/emails for a file called wallet.dat or for your “private keys”. You need one of these to get your bitcoin back. If you stored them on coinbase you can attempt to login and see if they are there (maybe you bought and never moved them?)
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:32:04
You could try taking doing a new download of electrum, then go find the wallet.dat file it creates and replace it with your old one and see, I’m not sure if electrum will let you export the private keys if you do this w/o the password tho 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:07:01

@_date: 2017-12-29 21:47:17
it has less effect each time
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:46:50
Hmmm. So what you need to do is look at the wallet and you’ll see a list of addresses and the bitcoin is behind one or more of the addresses. The private key you need is the one with the bitcoin in it, not just any random private key. See if you can find the private key for that specific wallet address. Since these are old, you should also search your computer for a wallet.dat file which would hold old private keys in case you had them backed up that way.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:26:59
It will be viable after the lightening network makes feed go to nearly 0 AND when they go through faster AND, most importantly, when people prefer to hold bitcoin instead of USD and have no desire to transfer it back. The last part of that requires stable (or at least predictably deflationary) prices so that if I buy a car today for a certain amount of bitcoin, that same car will cost the same amount or a predictably different amount the next day, or the next month. Without this credit will be impossible to generate from bitcoin because if I lend you one bitcoin tomorrow to buy a car and you agree to pay me back 1 bitcoin next month but now when that time comes that one bitcoin can buy 5 cars that’s an issue and it’s easy to see why crediting reliable credit is challenging.
To see this in action, consider this deal: ill give you one bitcoin today and over the next 30 years You pay me back 1/30th of a bitcoin. Would you do this? Well if you believe 1 bitcoin today will be worth the same in 30 years maybe, but if you believe a bitcoin in 30 years will be worth a million dollars then no way, because then you’d be paying me way “more” than I paid you.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:09:22
Go to your wallet and you’ll see a “receive” button. There will be a list of addresses in there

@_date: 2017-12-10 20:59:13
hey yeah so what you will ultimately do is find your Private keys. you may have this private key in this document or not. It may be a public key or a true seed. I would start by taking all codes you have to blockchain.info or another block explorer and, in the search bar, paste the code. if it is a public address it will tell you how many bitcoin are at that address. if it is a private address then you will need to convert the private key to a public key and do this same process.
the other thing to do is search your computer for a file called wallet.dat. if you find this, then you have your private keys
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:00:48
You can buy futures predicting the price to go up or down. What this really means is not that there are *no* sellers, but that there is one seller: the exchange.

No because there is different supply of litecoins (far more) so the price is expected to be far lower. There is a ton of dumb money flowing into crypto right now which is making us a lot of money but in the end most of them will be worthless, and after lightening network goes online there will be no good argument for either bcash or litecoin in my opinion they will lose money.

I understand what you’re saying but your analogy is flat out wrong. If I have your private key I can spend your bitcoin. That’s all I need. But if I have your account number I can spend your money. I’d need a password and identification among other things to get access. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:07:34
1) Export/obtain from backup all private keys. 2) Redownload electrum or another similar wallet 3) “sweep” keys into new wallet or new download of electrum (which shouldn’t have a password because it’s newly downloaded).
The problem will be if you can’t export keys without that password. The private key is not the password, the password protects your private keys from being used. Don’t share private keys with anyone online as anyone with the private keys can take those bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:37:49

regulation would be likely good in the long term as it would allow institutional money to play ball without being as worried about fraud. this is also one of the benefits of adding futures to the CME, which will regulate/oversee the trading and therefore makes it more difficult to commit fraud. it would ultimately depend on the type of regulations enacted

Yes. You can buy futures contracts at most prices, and they can trade primarily at prices drastically different than the assets itself. However, if the asses price doesn’t change as the futures traders believe, then they will lose money.

this is false. you can buy futures contracts right now on the bitcoin you're currently mining thereby ensuring profit over at least the next year on bitcoin mined at *current* prices. then any additional mined coins can be sold at profit if above the futures price.

coinbase is the easiest to use but there is a small fee.there is another company, GDAX,  which is an exchange owned by coinbase. so if you make a coinbase account, and then login with that same username to GDAX and deposit USD there, you won't pay the fee. then when you buy the BTC you can transfer it out to coinbase or your own wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:14:00
No if you use your coin are login to get into Gdax, you can transfer money in from a bank account and avoid buy fees. There’s YouTube videos to explain it step by step

I never said they had a monopoly on the technology. 
I argue that buying aol stock is not buying “aol brand + the internet they use” but with bitcoin you are buying “bitcoin brand + investing in the actual tech they use”. 
If you believe moneros *actual technology* is better than you can buy into the actual tech. 
The internet doesn’t even have a monopoly on the Internet. Any day someone could come along and make a better internet. If this had happened and had been why the tech bubble popped then the analogy would hold up. But that isn’t what happened

a future is short for a "futures contract" which is an agreement to buy or sell a coin at a future price, on a coin that already exists. see xbt.1:cboe : here bitcoin already exists and there are futures contracts on it. bitcoin cash is a fork-coin, for which futures do not exists. other forks exists such as bitcoin gold.

Take the public addresses to online block explorer and paste each of them into the search bar to see if the address has coin in them. Don’t trust the wallet because if you haven’t opened it in years it won’t be caught up. Once you figure out which wallet had coins through this method dump those private keys. 
This will also tell you if transferred the coins in and then back out, which would be informative for figuring out where they went if they truly aren’t there.

generally when bitcoin price goes up, its price relative to the alts goes up, so if you expect bitcoins price to go up move from alts to bitcoin, if you expect bitcoins price to go down, move into alts.

Then whoever had the card before you may also have kept a copy of it and can pull the coins out of that account at any time
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:47:22
you should just have a string of numbers and letters like
and then you just copy paste that in and click sweep. my guess is that you have a password which converted this private key to an encrypted private key, which is making it into this huge 242 character string you have. so if thats the case, you'll have to download the wallet you use to use and pull the unencrypted private key out using your password (hopefully you know that). im guessing this because you said "encrypted private key" in your email to yourself, which makes sense based on what youve said before
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:49:02
This depends on the wallet. If you need to download the block chain, you will not see it in the client (but will on the online look up) until you download the block chain all the way up to the block in which the transaction occurred.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:43:00
1) go to Blockchain.info and look up your bitcoin address in the SEARCH box. This will tell you if you have bitcoin. if you're still getting an error than you're doing something wrong, if the address existed in 2011 it should still be there. 
2) DO NOT disclose the 15 digit password anywhere, to anyone. that will get your BTC stolen. 
3) if there is BTC in that address or in another address this will be ultimately be assessable to you. the easiest way, in my opinion is to do a sweep with electrum because you probably don't want to download the whole block chain to the core. 
4) if you are still having problems, search your comp and backups for a wallet.dat file. if you have this and that password you will be able to recover all coins. 
5) the issue you may run into, is if all of your coins were on this mining website, and they put them in their own address and held the private keys. in that event, you wont have access to the coins in there and if they don't exist they won't have customer service either. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:57:42
The idea is that everyone in the network (or maybe not everyone now a days but still a huge number of people) have access to all of the transactions that have ever occurred and know, with mathematical certainty, where all bitcoins are at all times. 
So, unlike the US govt for example does with dollars, you cannot print new bitcoin without consent of the network. Therefore it is “decentralized”, because there is no central authority with the ability to print new money or change policy. 
With that said, some countries may outlaw the use of bitcoin. But it’s been around along enough (and even sold by the US govt for example) that it has enough credibility to where this shouldn’t happen. This probably held the price back for years, but we’re finally reaching the point of near mass adoption... it is being taxed and it will be on the CME next month giving it even more legitimacy. This is most of the recent price increase, in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:58:25
theres nothing "wrong" with coin base, except that youre a minor. in order to pull money out or increase purchases, they expect more and more type of identify verification (drivers license, linked in profile, etc) depending on how much you want your limit to be. so right now if you lie and say youre 18, and then in 2 or 4 or ten years you need to cash in or out a few hundred thousand dollars you might have major issues.

if you purchase right now with your bank account, then it will take ~8 days to go through but you will get it at the current price. if you purchase with a CC (cant buy as much) you will get it right now at current prices.

looking at the exchanges there were bigger sell walls a 9500 and 9650ish (no idea why, possibly a round number in YEN or Australian dollars, or some other currency?), so we should be smooth sailing through 10,000. if we can establish ourselves over 10K for event  few days so that the new coinbase accounts from thanksgiving week become verified we might actually not pull back more than a few hundred bucks, like when we crossed 9K

you dont need to wait for your wallet to sync to find out. just take the public (receive) addresses listed in the wallet over to a block explorer like blockchain.info and paste them into the search bar and if there are coins on any of them it will tell you the balances. So go through them and see if any of the address contains coins. Then if you find it, just obtain the private key to that address. if you have the private keys then you have the bitcoin and they can be salvaged. lmk if you get that far and still need help

it will probably drop at some point, but then it will go back up. the only non-anxiety producing way to do this is to buy bitcoin, put it in your wallet and forget about it. it will go up and down, probably by thousands of USD over the next few weeks. but most believe it will end early 2018 up at least 2-4 thousand dollars from where it is. if you buy, it will drop likely, but you just have to hold on.

Bitcoin is traded in a huge number of currencies. Only 1/4 of investors are in the US. Half are in Japan with more in Korea and elsewhere. They won’t care about this threshold just like we didn’t care last week when we blew through 1BTC to 1 million yen. If it crosses when they’re trading at night here we won’t even see it. There no real sell wall at 10k on Gdax right now either so that won’t be dampening it either

yes but you cant convert back to fiat. when you do it is taxable. so, for example, USD into coinbase --&gt; Bitcoin in coinbase --&gt; bitcoin in your own wallet --&gt; HODL, is not taxable. like all other assets if you sell within 1 year it is 30% tax on profit, if you HODL more than a year i think it is like 11% tax on profit.

Give it a bit. You probably cannot see it because it is unconfirmed.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:10:12
I think it is more complicated then that. While you are right that it will probably correct, some of us have been here for years and heard the same thing at $2 and $200 and at $1000. But it didn’t matter if you bought at the high or waited for the dip if you’re still here.
Also, this time is inherently different. The CME is coming but is not in place yet, and thanksgiving heralded a huge number of adopters, some of which are definitely still pending at coinbase and will have account access throughout this week. 
This would be like if the number of People investing the stock market doubled over a month or so, and it might not matter if the rsi hits 80 or not, it may not incur a major correction. That’s never happened before and neither has this.

as long as you have the private keys you'll get the coin
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:21:15
theres not even a real sell wall at 10K on DGAX compared to what we've seen in the past. if this volume keeps up we will surpass it in the next 2-3 days
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:38:13
are you trolling? your link is not related to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:58:51
damn. not sure what you can do about that. theoretically CB owns those private keys, so you can contact their support and show the transaction on the blockchain and hope they will be helpful. you can also try crossposting to because a few of the mods over there are employees

there is literally no evidence that satoshi is "the japs". It is almost definitely a California based individual and there is considerable evidence to this effect. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:12:10
why? there are currently virtually no sell orders at the 12K level on GDAX at least. i see no ceiling at that level
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:58:04
no way. theres such few sell orders over 10k that if it goes through, its gonna sky rocket.people won't be able to get their money into the sell side fast enough to slow this.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:03:20
not mathematically impossible. Highly, highly unlikely... but indeed non-zero probability.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:09:28
unless youre like this guy, and you lose your btc forever. i never said it was smart
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:03:15
electrum wallet. then once its in there, write down the public and private key and put it in your safe. then password protect the electrum waller, and dont open electrum until you need it again.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:32:35
i think it depends on how long we can hold on. if we can hold on through the middle of this week when new coinbase accounts from thanksgiving get verified/limits increased we could see it only pull back slightly, like it did at the 8K level. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:33:14
Then whoever had the card before you may also have kept a copy of it and can pull the coins out of that account at any time
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:57:08
highly dependent upon your miner/tech. need more info 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:24:06
no i guess i meant cost, or more precisely "exchange rate". the fee is a percentage that is fixed. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:54:43
if it was 2009 then you should be able to find a program called "bitcoin-qt" or "bitcoin qt". find the program on your computer and see whats in there. if you cant find that, search for the wallet.dat file that the program uses to hold your private keys. if you can find either of those or the private keys themselves (backed up in email, safe, etc) then you can recover your keys
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:45:44
that sell wall just crumbled. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:14:09
yeah sure, for you using USD. the nice thing is that all the people in Japan, China, Korea, etc dgaf about USD/BTC  they care about YEN/BTC, for example. the mass international adoption helps to smooth the sell walls. esp as were reaching an ATH right at china wakes up
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:34:11
It has felt that way for some of us, to some extent for a long time. There are people who bought in at 1 or 2 bucks and now they have a fortune.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:35:12
excellent! take your public keys to a block explorer online and see if there are coins in there. once you find which addresses have coins from your wallet, then you can look at sweeping them into a lite wallet like electrum, which is easy. heres a link to a block explorer:  and just paste the PUBLIC key into the search bar at the top
EDIT: by the way congrats! if 4 years old you might now be rich if you bought a few coins when they were that cheap
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:56:33
possibly but unlikely. thats one reason why there is delay after you buy on coinbase of a few days. also, coinbase price changes slower than the exchange prices, so it averages out. it can only rise/fall so fast. also, they are taking at least 1.5% fee so they are holding quite a bit of bitcoin to cover their costs of course but also any deviation due to quick drop in price
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:45:15
also keep in mind if your reddit account is known to your friends and family, posting the actual address, even though this is public, removes the pseudoanonymity conferred to you by bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:46:41
this person totally fails to account for the influx. the logic he/she is using applies to other assets where established investors are already in the game and the influx/efflux of investors is predictable. In the end, it may not matter AT ALL what the futures are selling for if coinbase, for example, continues to add 100,000 new users like they did this week. they will just blow through any strike prices the dampening effect won't be felt very much. I am not saying they are completely wrong, but at some point we will hit critical mass, and futures contracts at CME won't stop mass adoption, and when that happens the price will go up. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:26:56
you simply sweep your private keys into a bitcoin cash wallet, and then you also keep the same private keys with your bitcoin in it. so you have your Bcash in one wallet and your bitcoin in another using the same private keys. then just send the cash to the exchange and HODL the bitcoin, sell the bitcoin cash and send the resultant bitcoin back to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:55:42
yeah N. korea is shooting off ICBMs. just feeding the flames of this all run in both japan and s. korea
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:22:00
i cant disagree because i dont have all of the facts - im just looking at GDAX. 90% of the sell orders on their books there are between where we are and 10,500 so if we get through that there will be no sellers on, unless new sellers come online. however, it takes time for sellers to get their cold storage onto the exchange to make a sell. if they see "oh! its at 10k im gonna sell" and its not already on the books, then they will be too slow to sell and it will just keep going.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:16:18
hes wrong. thats only true if you clicked buy, not if your waiting for USD deposit. OP should go to a different exchange to buy at current prices
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:21:32
take all of your public keys to an online block explorer and see which of your wallets have bitcoin in them. thats where i would start
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:17:23
spelled "you" wrong in the sidebar looking for donations. otherwise looks clean. consider what makes your blog better/different and highlight that if you want people to come to it
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:15:32
if you have the bank account you should be okay on coin base. you'll be limited but i think in the 10-15k per week range. 
also, to clarify.... i meant find someone on local bitcoins who will sell you, for example, 50,000 USD in bitcoin. then instead of sending that person 50000 you send the SAME person 100 transactions at 500 bucks for how ever much bitcoin 500 bucks is worth
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:14:31
I want to say that it is possible but I have never encountered this problem as I live in the US. You may be able to buy through local bitcoins even though you’re not “local”. You would send them small amounts of USD in exchange for small amounts of btc back and forth so as to avoid anyone cheating/scamming. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:58:44
Okay but why not use coin base or a bitcoin atm? The fees are so high right now 50-100 in bitcoin makes little sense 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:22:20
Damn. Well search old emails or file storage devices for “bitcoin” and “wallet.dat” in case you backed it up 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:40:48
no a mining pool does not solve a block. an individual miner in a pool solves a block and shares the reward with the pool. either way, his concern makes no sense. the only time banks ever get in trouble is when it is OBVIOUSLY fraudulent and they dont report. this is a non-issue for bitcoin because there is no central authority who "should" be watching.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:51:27
do you have the public and private keys for those coins? if so go to a block explorer and input your public key. it will tell you if you have a balance in there
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:55:18
Well you could have them make a coinbase account since they are in the US and then you give them the money to make the purchase. There are basically exchanges for each country, so it depends on where you are/where your banks are
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:40:08
google bitcoin ATMs near you. this is the easiest, but usually comes with a 5-7% fee if there is one. also, check localbitcoins.com and see if there are any dealers near you, ideally meet in person.
the default conversion is USD. coin base doesn't require an SNN (i believe) unless youre trying to buy sell more than 10K USD worth at a time
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:17:05
crosspost to some of the mods are coinbase employees, see their sidebar
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:50:36
there are already futures trading going on with BTC. they already started, just not at CME.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:24:22
it will be delivered for the price you purchased for. it just takes a few days before you have access to it. so if it goes to 15K between now and 10 days from now, you will only be charged whatever you purchased it for. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:05:57
these buy and sell sizes occur almost hourly on numerous exchanges and have for months if not years. stop fear mongering
