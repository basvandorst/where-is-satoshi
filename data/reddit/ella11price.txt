You do not need the coinbase app. You can use anything to pay. The coinbase app just makes it easier.

I agree. Any ideas?

Basically

Very true. Luckily we have a safe and secure escrow =)

You can use it anywhere =)

One of the things that sets us apart is that we offer stable coin utilization. When you sell an item for $50 in whatever crypto we will make sure you end up with $50. Other sites will keep the crypto amount. This means the seller will most likely lose money in a bear market.
You can read about it here.

Good question. We charge buyers a small 3% fee, Since there are not taxes on crypto transactions they are already saving money by not paying the standard 7% in the United states. (Varies state to state) Forra is a win-win for buyers and sellers.

Amazon can charge much more % wise. Upwards of 20% when you use FBA to sell with.

We plan on it in the future

@_date: 2018-10-14 20:57:47

@_date: 2018-10-15 13:17:41
Yes we do!  this should answer a lot of your questions.
@_date: 2018-10-14 20:23:16
We plan on it!

No way really? We chose Fora because it means a roman marketplace.
