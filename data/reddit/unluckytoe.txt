I gotta say I'm sorry. Missed it by one key.
@_date: 2019-03-26 13:54:00
Now that is a topic worth talking about.

Time Travel without Science!

Moral of the story: HODL. 
@_date: 2019-03-06 08:58:34
Especially the Egyptians holding bitcoin
@_date: 2019-03-26 14:54:48
A small step for man, a giant leap for mankind.
@_date: 2019-03-26 14:56:17
Dammit. You caught me.
@_date: 2019-03-06 10:27:33
I guess commercial transactions will mean they can't trade it for goods or services. They have a long way to go financially if this is their take on bitcoin, or even just crypto in general.
@_date: 2019-03-23 11:39:23
Are you talking about bitcoin as a whole?
@_date: 2019-03-06 14:13:10
Yeah. I agree with you. There are GCC countries that are quite open to cryptocurrency innovation. It's just one country that says this. 
I didn't post this to propagate hate, but just found this interesting and to inquire on the situation regarding crypto in Egypt.

If you believe in crypto and the morals behind it, you should at least do what you can. Spread the word of crypto among your peers and colleagues and anyone else, and don't sell.
Of course there are these assholes who will come and steal your money and do nothing to pay it back. You should try and find out which ones are legit or invest if you are willing to lose. 
P.S I still feel it's too early to say that crypto is dead.
@_date: 2019-03-26 16:28:31
They're not a bank. They've partnered with Goldman Sachs
@_date: 2019-03-20 14:55:15
Yeah. But it was good till then.
@_date: 2019-03-12 08:14:01
Bitcoin can never be thrown on the streets.
@_date: 2019-02-28 08:50:25
Because it's Micheal Cohen. This is just a new meme.
@_date: 2019-02-21 13:27:20
Umm... I don't think any crypto is trying to "copy" Bitcoin. They might look at it as a father figure, but not anything more.
@_date: 2019-04-11 07:56:04
No more 'To the moon!'
Now, it's 'To the Black Hole!'
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:34:15
Haha looks like no one is prepared for this bull run.
@_date: 2019-01-19 02:37:25
That's what I ended up doing
@_date: 2019-01-18 08:39:22
@_date: 2019-01-18 07:32:43
Yeah it was. It sounds very scammy but I keep reading otherwise here and there.
I don't think I'll participate in it anyway. Just watch from outside and see what happens
@_date: 2019-01-18 08:38:20
Well at least someone called me cute.
Yeah, I know it probably is a scam, but just wanted to confirm for sure, you know
@_date: 2019-01-18 06:39:23
Apparently, there are people saying they've already got back 10x the amount
@_date: 2019-01-18 16:14:24
Haha it's cool. No worries :)
@_date: 2019-01-19 02:25:49
Sounds like the next startup idea
@_date: 2019-01-18 07:30:42
Yeah that very much sounds like it
@_date: 2019-01-19 03:14:17
Wow thanks, man!
