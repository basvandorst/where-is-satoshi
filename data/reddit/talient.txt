Does this mean that if any of the mail relays between blockchain.info and my mail server are compromised, my wallet backups (that are sent from blockchain) can be too?

Wow, why is it 1.4 mBTC? I would imagine an amount like 1.68 mBTC would be better in HK.

We should phase out single credential wallets.
I like what trustedcoin (api.trustedcoin.com) is doing in the wallet space. n-of-m signatories, multi-channel notification (email, SMS, etc), withdrawal latency (up to a day, I think).
For my own cold wallet, I'd probably want one that is 3-of-5 (4 of which I own, the 5th would be managed by a trusted 3rd party) to access, limited confirmation window (I am notified that I've set a withdrawal in motion and I have to give approval within x hours), and contains a withdrawal latency of a minimum of 1 day after approval.

This is actually good news.

They can sell it on Ebay UK from Feb 10!

Bitcoin - died and came back more times than Jesus.

You're right. Any one of the hundreds (?) of chains that have their own stored value card system could probably adopt the acceptance of BTC. Generally Singapore businesses tend to walk the tightrope between kiasi-ness (don't want to be first and get slapped down by an authority .. then malu also...) and kiasu-ness (don't want to lose out on early-mover advantages).

On the one hand, I agree with this.
What bugs me, on the other, is the sort of challenges a legitimate startup has to go through even without this stacked against them. If you have just one Great Business Idea(tm) in your entire life, how would you go about making it known and seeking buyers/investors on the Internet?

Very useful preso. I've learned a fair bit of new stuff on BTC even though I've been dabbling for a few months now.

Wait, this is cos the SEC thinks domestic and foreign terrorists crowdfund their activities?

Liquidity is way too low there. I'm from Singapore and I've only used them once when I needed some BTC in a hurry. All other times I get my coins off of other exchanges. (Edit: speling)

Google+... right. Like Bitcoin needs a dead social platform to propagate.

I think that's the thing. Politicians *don't* know how bad it would be, which is why both sides are still playing chicken. In fact, I think that no one really knows just how bad it would be, if it happened.
That said, I agree with some of the sentiment here -- the world will go on turning. Most people outside of the US might not even be aware of it, or care if they did.

My 2 Satoshis.
Their launch was very quiet. It almost seemed like they were trying to stay under some radar or, for whatever reason, did not want to attract attention. I think that most Singaporeans are unaware that there's a BTC exchange here.
Also, could anyone pick a worse name for an exchange? I mean, why not singaporeBTCexchange.com? What's with the 5 random letters that I can't make head or tails of?
