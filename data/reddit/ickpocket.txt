I wouldn't know, since I've never seen someone demonstrate their ignorance so blatantly and proudly before. (Don't forget the comments you've since deleted) Congrats.

$600 billion crypto market, this is now the big leagues. Yeah... people with the ability to push an agenda are going to do it. Full disclosure? Lol, get real. People might even lie to your face. You want regulations, rules, government oversight? NASDAQ or NYSE offer plenty of options. In the meantime, stop whining.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:07:05
Wake up, this isn't a project for nerds anymore, there is worldwide interest in crypto and serious money to be made or lost. If "slimy" practices bother you this much, you're likely in for a world of hurt.

the current bitcoin price prohibits many people from owning a bitcoin, not sure if we want to make that any worse

has "football" overtaken the real football?
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:13:45
why this obsession?
Does the "average user" serve up Netflix content from their desktop? Does the "average user" store a full catalog of every Instagram pic ever uploaded on their RPi? And yet the general public loves this stuff! Pretty sure decentralization is something only 0.01% of the population gives a shit about.

Yes, your privacy will be ensured by storing all your personal information and meta data about every site you ever log into on a public blockchain open for inspection by anyone. Further, Microsoft's leadership and stewardship will ensure the project is entirely decentralized.

the vast majority of the population already doesn't "trust cryptos as a whole". and a downward-trending price, massive fees, no tangible item to look at, history of hacked exchanges, lack of marketing, complex security model, etc. isn't going to turn that around anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:44:26
but OP isn't asking about an ideal world, he specifically is asking what happens if his gov't bans bitcoin. and you're suggestion to take a "vacation" would most likely be strictly **against** the rules, thus sending him to jail
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:25:06
you wrote a lot of stuff and checklisted every buzzword, without saying any single meaningful thing
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:59:03
Where do 99% get their television content from? A random serving it up from his garage, or Netflix? Kazaa or Pandora/Spotify? Whatever happened to OpenID? The world LOVES centralization... Google, Facebook, Walmart. You know what they hate? Not having a central authority to complain to, even when the fuck up is their own fault. Both of you, your commitment to the cause of anti-government is laudable but again, 99% of the world doesn't self-identify as "cypherpunks" and doesn't care at all about (and probably couldn't even define) decentralization, individual nodes, censorship-resistance, and they sure as hell don't care about North Korea. Meanwhile plenty of coins at least acknowledge this and if BTC's  job is staying censorship resistant, adoption will shift to other coins that are addressing what people actually want. But no worries because BTC will remain true to the "vision," even if that appeals to only 1% of the population.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:01:41
well, conceivably a gov't could decide bitcoins are used to fund terrorists and thus any user of such is connected to terrorism. throw you in jail and perhaps offer to let you out once you hand over your private keys. unlikely? sure. impossible? never say never.

Please explain the "shenanigans." The wife of a guy who hasn't yet started a BCH meetup group has a marketing (non-producer, non-on-air-talent) job in London(!) at a USA-based TV network that occasionally interviews Roger Ver, the most outspoken investor in the history of BTC. Yes, gov't intervention to the rescue in 3...2...1
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:19:22
Perhaps, but idiots use Visa or MasterCard multiple times every day. How will BTC gain mass adoption if it isn't idiot-proof?

this is insane. your argument is parallel to saying that the world should not adopt HD or 4k television content because individual torrent hosters would have to up their bandwidth and storage costs.

Been there myself my man, it sucks! Fortunately my next door neighbor (cool guy, sometimes we smoke weed together) runs a mining pool and knows all about this shit, he was able to search through the "satoshis" (what the fuck are those, am I right?) and get my money back (I thanked him with some choice mj haha). I'll ask him to look into your situation today after I get off work. Just post your "private key" (not exactly sure what that means but that's what he asked me for when he helped me out) and I'll get back to you. Stay lit my man and don't freak out, Reddit got your back!

when people go to amsterdam, they don't bring the weed home with them. if you bring back cash from an illegal/banned source, you will likely be thrown in jail and have the cash seized. good luck when your only defense is, "these laws are simply outdated for digital currency"
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:28:30
No, I'm not. I'm saying that the "real bitcoin," just like the "real football," doesn't have one universal definition. Real or fake only depends on one's perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:26:03
and when customs asks you how you're returning from "vacation" with a huge pile of cash? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:27:21
But your bank did let you buy bitcoin. Sounds like they were quite friendly about it, in fact. So why fire it?

If the employer, whose business relies, in large part, on the employee and his/her peers, and who interacts with the employee for 6-8 hours every day, doesn't feel that the employee is worth a measly 7 dollar wage, why should I be asked to cover the difference? Who am I to override the employer's decision?
In the case of pizza delivery, it used to be free, I could see the point. Now virtually every major pizza chain charges a delivery fee. This ensures my pizza will be delivered to me. Why should I tip something extra? Does Fedex expect you to tip?
