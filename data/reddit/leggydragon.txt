I downloaded Chrome when I first got my laptop. Everything is online these days so I haven't downloaded anything else except Bitcoin and only because I've read bitcoin isn't safe to do online.
Bitcoin has become a high priority target even this official warning says so but I also read it in the news all the time. Add to that how often there are updates and how important it is to stay up to date. I think all Bitcoin wallets justify this secure upgrade node thing.
I'm scared every time I update. I couldn't figure out the gpg command line stuff everyone is talking about. You can't click to go back and edit what you wrote. You have to memorize all these words and copy and paste things but there's no menu or toolbar with copy and paste buttons. Then when you mess up you have to start all over again.
The worst part is I installed Bitcoin for friends and when I tell them they need to update they all want me to do it for them but I really have no idea what I'm doing lol. Sometimes I google Bitcoin and pick the first thing that doesn't look like an ad, sometimes I just try to remember the website, bitcoin.com I think? I think there's two now? I just know I'm going to mess this up some day.

Your reply is great, except the last line. It comes off as hostile and doesn't add anything to the conversation.

Why is it called freecast if it costs money? I guess because it's free for him to cast these streams (ie illegally)?
