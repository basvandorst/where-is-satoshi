Not true. He could write any message he wanted, sign it with either one of the PGP-keys attributed to him, or with a bitcoin private key that corresponds to one of the Satoshi-mined blocks in the beginning of the chain and publish the message via TOR.
His real-life persona would still be unknown, but we would have cryptographic proof that the author is Satoshi (or at the very least in possession of Satoshi's keys).

You might be clinically retarded. Please seek help.
As I stated before, the passphrase gets appended to the mnemonic.
If there are 128-bits of entropy, or with a 24-word-mnemonic, 256-bits of entropy, adding one word, even if it's a dictionary word like a common first name, DOES NOT DECREASE THE ENTROPY.
Now, do you think, that of all the dictionary words there are, or to make the case even better for your "understanding", assume we only use first names and assume there are only 1000 first names.
Does adding one of 1000 first names add entropy? Is there no entropy to be gained, by picking one out of a 1000?
I'm not saying, that the added name is cryptographically sufficient, but, and now don't shut down your brain: it doesn't have to be cryptographically sufficient, BECAUSE YOU ALREADY HAVE AT LEAST 128-BITS OF ENTROPY FROM THE MNEMONIC!

Yes, there is. You're missing the point. OP only wants to take care of one seed phrase, for whatever reason.
But he wants to use it in two wallets.
You can either use it straight up, where both use the same wallet, which could lead to some race condition.
Or, to logically separate them, you can add a trivial passphrase, in order to arrive at two different extended private keys.
The `Brad` and `Angelina` passphrase is not to increase entropy/security, although it does, it's to logically separate the wallets.
Using different derivation paths would also work, but that's something not many wallets support and it's probably easier to forget a derivation path, than to forget your first name.
And here is why even a trivial passphrase like `Brad` or `Angelina` increases security:
You're mitigating rainbow attacks, by introducing personal data into the generation of the extended private key. If for example, it turns out that the RNG on a specific platform is weaker than expected and an attacker starts to rainbow table out all possible mnemonic seed phrases that this poor RNG produces, Brad and Angelina aren't in it and won't get their wallets cleaned out.

@_date: 2019-11-27 19:18:49






The way these passphrases work is, they are appended to the seed. You are always using a passphrase, in a sense, which is empty.
So you only gain entropy, by appending it, even if the passphrase itself is weak.

They don't, though.
@_date: 2019-11-30 19:31:59
Okay, you're just too dense to understand, that the passphrase can not decrease the security anyway. If it could, than clearly, the mnemonic by it's own wouldn't be safe, since BIP39 always uses a passphrase, just an empty one, if the user doesn't provide one.

Supports tons of shitcoins. More code = more attack surface. More shitcoins = less time goes into making the actual functionality, being a bitcoin wallet, safer.
I remember testing it once and what completely threw me off, was the fact, that you first had to deposit funds into the wallet, before it let you do a backup of the seed. Which is a UX choice that makes no sense, at all.
But that UX choice demonstrated the abysmal understanding of security by the developers of Exodus, if you ask me.

Don't confuse multi sig with splitting up a seed or passphrase. 
Splitting a 24 seed into two 12 word parts is sort of like a 2of2 SSSS, except that I wouldn't vouch for both parts actually containing 128-bits of entropy, because of the checksum word.
To fend off a casual finder of your paper backup, it's probably enough, is my guess.
So having a physically safe hardware wallet like a Ledger, protected with a random PIN and a 2of2 Split of the seed in two different locations might be a good solution to achieve redundancy and security.

I don't know... We also say: "do you accept Visa?" Or "Pay with PayPal, it's so fast!" And not "Do you accept USD over Visa?" or "Send USD IOUs over the PayPal-Network!".
It's a tightrope act between accuracy and not coming across like a pedantic loon.
EDIT: In retrospect, OP might be complete off, to be honest. Think about it: if you pay using Bitcoin over Lightning, you're actually using BTC/LN as a rails to transfer USD. You might be physically sending $5 worth of BTCs using the LN protocol to buy that coffee, but in reality you're using BTC/LN as a payment network to transfer a USD amount. So the phrase "do you accept lightning?" is the perfect analogon to "do you accept Visa?". You're literally doing the same thing.
Maybe in 15 years, you're actually paying 0.5 sats for a coffee and you're paying that no matter if you use the Visa network or LN, but what you ask the merchant, won't change.

No. The same level of security would be achieved with 3*12 words. 12 words = 128-bits of security.
But: BIP39 also has a checksum built in, so it's not that easy to divide.
The tactics in combination with a BIP39 seed, would for me to use a passphrase as a 13th/25th word.
So papers 1 to 3 would contain the full 12 or 24 word seed, but only parts 1&amp;2, 2&amp;3 and 1&amp;3 of the passphrase.

This question is kind of like asking "what if 2 + 2 = 5?"
A scenario you described is impossible. Here's why:
It does not matter how big the blocks are, 1 MB or 1 GB, they will be full.
Because if they aren't full, then the price of blockchain-space is undervalued. This market-imbalance will be exploited by people. They'll play satoshi-dice or do some other stuff, until the blocks fill up again, at which point transactions that are the least valuable to the blockchain users aren't made (law of diminishing marginal utility).
The question of blocksize is more about long-term value of the blockchain, which can only be sustained if it remains decentralized, and as a consequence of that, immutable. Decentralization is the only selling-point of a blockchain. Other datatypes are superior in every other way, except this.
To guarantee decentralization, you want as many nodes as possible. Increasing the blocksize pushes nodes on the margin out, i.e. you have centralization pressure.
But another thing about a blocksize increase is even more detrimental to the long-term value of a blockchain:
By design, a blocksize-*increase* is a hardfork. A hardfork means, that the rules of the chain are changed at a certain moment.
In other words: **the very first act of a hardfork is to demonstrate to the world, that this chain is not immutable**, which is *the only value* a blockchain brings. Therefore, a hardfork of a blockchain can never be as valuable as the original chain and I suspect, that the value of every hardforked chain will go to basically zero.
