No, we cannot trust them. I've yet to hear a thing from them about my claims from the weekend. As far as I'm concerned, they've stolen my money.

I haven't gotten a peep from them regarding my two customer support emails. Busy or thieves? How should I know at this point?

If they complete the order at the price when I was quoted, I'll consider the matter resolved. Otherwise, we CANNOT trust BitInstant again despite the title of that post. They are likely using people's money to buy bitcoins, waiting for the price to go up then fulfilling their orders at a higher price (selling the bitcoins they just purchased with your money). When the price starts dropping I'd imagine people's orders will be fulfilled faster. This smells like fraud.

I sent two support emails to BitInstant this weekend and have not heard a thing. Money was taken from my Dwolla account even though the transaction failed:

Agree. And to have the transactions failing and funds immediately refunded would be one thing... they're taking people's money with no feedback. As long as the price is skyrocketing I'm guessing all these people's orders will be fulfilled at a much higher price than when quoted while BitInstant used your cash to make a nice profit in the interim.
