Thats why btc should not be converted to real currency, it should be the paying method for other items like food, merchandise. Then the real value for normal person increases and real currencies will be like floppy disk and Kodak cameras. Otherwise we all depend on the central system regardless of invention of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. There will be a time when we all adapt to this, but it can not be done if other people are converting to real currency.

We all pay tax when we buy stuff, like cars 200% tax worth of the vehicle. Its insane amount of tax in various counties. Lot of tax go to weapons, expensive missiles (each cost about several millions ) mostly to kill other people with more weapons which are also from tax. At the end earth and living beings get destroyed and land full of bad soil which can not be used for cultivation. Ya we need roads and hospitals, schools etc, but are the tax money used only for that. If so I'm very happy to give my all wealth to tax.

How do they know where it came from before the paper wallet. Is it through illegal business , or selling bad things or through good business. No one knows. So they can hold anyone with big sums a criminal if they want. Because its untraceable. Value is not not going with conventional databases and systems with plain simple methods.

Nice to know that. Thats reasonable. Winning a lottery also taxable. Buying a vehicle also taxable(for us more than 200%). So buying a say $10,000 vehicle you need like $30,000. When compared to that 15% is nothing. Anyway both methods get add up to taxes at the end when buying a product and getting the salary. I think ancient kings(some kings) did worse than this. Had to give percentage crops and earnings and had to work as a slave for no money ultimate goal was to get more land by war.
