Why did you put up such a "straw man"? Making a parallel with religious groups in an attempt to counter what I wrote is not going to do good to anybody. (It seems also superfluous to say that I'm not religious and I see what you meant)
I'm not one of those people saying BUY BUY BUY goddamn it... and bitcoiners (I am a bitcoiner myself) surely have some individuals who behave like that too, so they shouldn't blame others of defending  their coin without conditional.
I was just trying to be reasonable: even if some bitcoiners (who in some cases, in my opinion, behave like assholes) say that doge is going to crash (they have their right to think that), they should be grateful for everything dogecoin did for crypto.
Many, many people wouldn't have got into crypto without doge. Doge fucking sponsored water for third world countries. The community has some flaws, but please don't be assholes when you talk about it.

I couldn't agree more with your comment. I didn't like OP's choice of words when he said "saving".
Saving is not the solution against consumerism. The solution is investing. BTC right now is not providing the right formula, because it makes you hold your wealth without touching it. In the future we should really need to implement the method you presented here as a standard practice.

Actually you could argue for it being a copy of litecoin, not bitcoin. Transactions are faster, and it was invented to promote gpu mining.
Not attacking anyone, it just seems that most people in this sub need to chill. Doge did a lot of good to crypto.

You could say the same thing of bitcoin... Just because people can manipulate it, it doesn't mean it's a scam perpetrated by the devs themselves.
Edit: by the way it has never been worth that much... except for an early trading software bug. You are either badly informed or intellectually dishonest.
