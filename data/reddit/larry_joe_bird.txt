If you can't find the fundamental flaw in the context of  Whale manipulation and what tether actually is and how it moved prices, how can I assume anyone that thinks im just trolling here would be able to see the problem here beyond that?? I loved everything about the bull run last year but come on people ease up on the sips

They gave us an estimate, said the door won't open. Type of neighbors to park their car in the middle of the road knowing that there could be the chance of getting something out of us. The truck is a standard 04 ford ranger and I honestly didn't even see the fucking thing smh don't think i've ever been angrier at myself

My mothers car got repossessed throough bankruptcy and she got into an accident like 3 years ago that raised her rates exponentially. If we put it on the insurance she'd be fucked and i can't do that to my mamma 
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:56:46

Im waiting for bitcoin to hit 100,000 soon so i can justify it to myself. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:42:29
Just had to spend all my coin because of an accident I couldn't cover w insurance. To say the least, seeing my coins go after buying all summer and watching the money grow grow grow, really reallly really hurts. Hold that shit and don't back out of your driveway and hit your asshole neighbors shitty nissan they park in the road. Fuck you neighbors if you somehow read this, you know who it is
