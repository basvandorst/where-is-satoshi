but baconreader dude

With that amount, I would guess experience and learning about crypto.

the dogecoin tip bot is banned from this sub

It almost definitely isn't him paying, it is almost always his company that pays for the medallion. The main thing he is risking (if his company owns it) is losing his job/possibly getting sued.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:50:58
well it's back now with an announcement!
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:29:11
5 or 5s only
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:41:02
Eh, I have tried flow, but I just like the way baconreader works. Personal preference I guess.

At the moment, fiat is a whole lot more stable than bitcoin is though.
@_date: 2014-04-22 14:42:04
you need a brain
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:09:25
All the other posts are pretty much proof that gox is gone. good luck to everyone that has bitcoins with them though!
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:31:14
he doesn't want them to make money off of it. It has to be solely motivated by their want to switch to android. The 5 is comparable to the nexus he offers, so there is no monetary motivation to do this.
@_date: 2014-05-11 20:50:35
other than drugs and weapons?
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:40:01
Who cares? they made a little joke, so what?
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:56:37
No, I made the mistake, but I apologized and got my account back. When someone is shadowbanned, that is the page you normally see when you go to their account, the nonexistent one. This means that yes, he has been shadowbanned.

not with that font...
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:58:29
Wierd, maybe they changed it? It definitely was a month ago 
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:45:04
500 bitcoin is $137,432 so 5btc would be 1,374
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:14:32
Well it's a lot more volatile than most.
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:59:17
I'm nauseous too, but it's probably just a hangover.
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:15:47
I actually got shadowbanned on another account for a simple mistake, disputed it 9 months later, and now my account is back!
@_date: 2015-07-09 10:23:48
They actually are because there are tons of bots that use the information to automatically trade, and they have a legitimate advantage when they get data milliseconds ahead of other bots

Just saying, this is the most stereotypical reddit post ever. Nothing meshes better than electronic cryptocurrency and e-cigarettes in the reddit stereotype.
@_date: 2015-04-20 03:29:50
check out .
  
It's not just that though, they're popular with the reddit stereotype of a programmer or techie guy that sits at his computer for quite a bit of the day.
@_date: 2015-04-20 10:51:25
I understand that, I'm just saying it fits the stereotype
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:20:49
I thought only PayPal allowed reversing after 180 days?
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:50:37
I have no idea, but he agreed to that price and can't really complain.
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:17:21


   
 
Why couldn't other money processors do this? Or bank wires?  
  
just curious because im very new to btc.
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:48:38
makes sense, thanks
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:33:31
so he should have found someone else if that was an issue...
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:32:20
sell to the feds, duh :P
@_date: 2015-02-11 05:11:59
Bribed how? Please give specifics
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:56:22
they're way old discussions and I can't find them either, but I definitely saw similar comments back when the charges came out.
@_date: 2015-02-16 06:45:48
still tiny
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:59:04
@_date: 2015-02-11 05:01:43
Yes, I read it, but how does lobbying make a politician money? 
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:33:13
and who is they exactly? 
  
I swear if you say corporations....
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:09:59
Great evidence 
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:53:38
examples please?
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:56:13
And how exactly do they make money by keeping drugs illegal?   
  
No they don't get bribed if you were going to say that 
@_date: 2015-02-06 15:07:25
Impressive. I don't think the fine should be in any way proportional to their profits. It should only be proportional to the profit that they made from this venture imo.
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:00:08
agreed, although to be fair his mom only said that he was a hero for doing what he did, not that he didn't do anything wrong.
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:57:01
What evidence do you have that politicians are hired by companies?
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:36:09


  
Don't you think that's pushing the truth a bit?
@_date: 2013-12-11 11:36:36
I'm 14 and in 10th though so some 8th graders can be 12
