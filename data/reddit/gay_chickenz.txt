Then short some BTC or XBT contracts. You’ll make a fortune if you’re right

Hehe, you’d be surprised what cannabis users can accomplish. I’m very happy with my market performance.
But thanks for lookin out, chobroni
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:29:05
That’s a wrap guys. Up 1000% yoy and this chobroni has declared bitcoin dead. I guess we can all go home.
Someone should tell the NASDAQ they don’t need to release their new futures contract anymore

I remember seeing an article a couple days ago indicating an inverse relationship between bitcoin price and the VIX volatility index

Nah, the US markets have been on a tear this month, so it’s just making a correction. Plus the government is set to shutdown next week if immigration isn’t resolved.
Crypto is dipping partially because of the volatility in other markets, and partially on the risk that the Tether audit will show less than their supposed $2.3 B in reserve.
Stupid watergate definitely isn’t helping tho

Crypto is heavily oversold, bullish bounce inc

27k is my high-conviction target for 2018, so I’d probably hold if I were you. But that’s me and idk what sorta interest you’re lookin at

It just incentivizes the investment of sustainable energy production and storage.

OR crypto behaves as a sector, so crash in the confidence of crypto market drives down the price of the whole market.
When oil crashed, all oil-based stocks went with it
This is the risk of speculative markets

I agree with this. It’s basically to disincentivize political market manipulation.
Regulation is inevitable. Better transparency than irrationality

Oh yeah, nice plan! Buying and holding has been more effective than trading recently anyhow. I swing trade futures contracts, but it’s very risky (for example, I’m down 20% on the day). 
I do well enough, but I don’t recommend trying. It takes some getting used to (swinging between euphoria and despair), and I started out losing 70% of my account my first month.
I think crypto is going to see an explosion in growth in the next 5 years as more institutional vehicles (ETFs, 401k plans, etc.) enter the market and regulation becomes more established and predictable.

And if it’s lying about it’s reserves........

Lolwut. Pretty sure it no currency existed, there’d be global anarchy.
 
Or are you okay with being paid in garbanzo beans?

How will bitcoin fall if no one shorts?
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:10:52
A lot of us have been there... I told my friends I was going to throw $5k into bitcoin back when it was $20, and I let them talk me out of it.
Gotta look forward!
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:10:19
Yeah, if you buy a 6-month call

The bitcoin equivalent to “THE END IS NIGH”

CNBC... classic anti-bitcoin shilling.
You know there’s like 1 guy that’s done this.
If this starts happening on a huge scale, that would be a strong indicator of a bubble. But we’re not there yet.

Futures contracts increases leverage and liquidity of the underlying asset.
What this means is bitcoin will more rapidly converge to a relatively stable value. It also means volatility is likely to go up in the short-term and down in the long-term.

"No one ever became rich by diversifying" --Buffett
Diversifying is fine if you're looking for meager returns, but you're also capping the potential reward.
That being said, as with any high-risk investment, be prepared to lose it all.
