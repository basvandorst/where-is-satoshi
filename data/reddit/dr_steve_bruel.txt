I believe it is a legitimate market, however there are a lot of people trying to cash in on something they know nothing about. But hopefully the widespread adoption of btc will lead to a better understanding of how crypto works.

Well I guess I don't have much of a vision of what it will become past a replacement for PayPal. Instead all commerce websites will have the default payment type as bitcoin. I think it would be a very big change to make bitcoin the sole global currency and it would be met with great resistance. Perhaps something will happen in the near future that will make that change more feasible like other economies crashing or something. I'm not saying I don't want bitcoin to succeed, I just don't think it's going to happen overnight or even any time soon.

@_date: 2018-08-12 21:46:57
Fair enough. The way I see it, I can already use it at quite a few online locations. I'd like to see it become more widely used and if and when it does, I'd like to already have some (and hopefully have it worth more than it is now) so I wont be late to the party

I too lived paycheck to paycheck and I started purchasing small amounts of bitcoin. Started with just 25$ ever few weeks, until I got a better job and then I started spending some bitcoin on things I buy anyway, purchasing more bitcoin right after. Some websites give a discount for using crypto. To each their own. I'm sure if bitcoin becomes more mainstream, itll be easier to access

so i tried to purchase something, after typing the bitcoin address and transferring the bitcoin, the page said to wait on the page for a confirmation. I reloaded the page after a couple minutes and the page returned a 404. should I be worried? were the other steps to follow after initiating the purchase?

I'm done with trading actually. Made some gains, lost some, I'd just rather hodl now and accumulate as much as I can. Though I do still feel the urge to sell and wait this dip out to buy again. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 00:19:23
Yea I'd say so. I'm just extrapolating from the so far repeating pattern we've seen. A relatively large spike, followed by a gradual increase and another spike and so on. I think the price will go as low as 5-6k in the next few months but in maybe 2 or 3 years, the pattern will repeat but at a much higher price. 
This is pure speculation but just look at the price from inception to now. Its not a perfect pattern but it isn't just random.

But at least funny story, I actually was messaged by a scammer who brought up actual footage of me beating it. They tried to extort 500$ from me, and I was like, 'I'm 15. I don't have 500$'. They said they'd post them from my Facebook but nothing ever came up from it

Well in this stage of bitcoins life, I think mass adoption is the goal. So offering goods or services in exchange of bitcoin is the way to go. Setting up a website to sell stuff for bitcoin is one thing, but figuring out exactly what you'll sell is another. Perhaps you can offer your skills and freelance for bitcoin. Make a website where experienced coders can go, link their portfolio and have others who want some tech project made, and contract the coders out to do the jobs in return for bitcoin. Like rent-a-hacker. Not sure if this is already a thing but if it isn't, go for it. I too am working on building a site to sell something for bitcoin. Maybe we could collab.

I am employed and am currently devoting most of my time to learning as much python as I can and understanding modern cryptography. I've dabbled with django in the web side of python. Honestly the 'service', whatever that may be, doesnt matter to me. I'm more interested in working on the project as a whole to get more experience making a working website. If you're not a python guy, I'm sure I could figure out another languages framework with enough time

It's worth looking into. Protecting information from outsiders across a peer to peer network built on trust. The more bitcoin is used, the harder it becomes to mess with.

You can literally sell anything. Someone posted a website that accepted only cryptocurrencies a few weeks Go and I buy vape juice from a site that gives 10% off for using crypto. 
If you're asking how to make such a site, there are web development tools and libraries to help set up payment via crypto.

Thanks cryptodelia,  of course I get downvotes for predicting a price drop but what can you do. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:50:28
I first bought in at 11k, watched it drop to 10k and bought some more, only to have it drop sub 9k. Of course I grabbed some more. Would never risk more than I can afford to lose, except now the value of my wallet is less than what I invested. So for now it's just staying in with what I have with hopes of it stabilizing at a slightly higher price. I honestly don't think the price is going to go any higher than what we've seen already. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:55:55

But that's a power of 2, and 10 is divisible by 2, so that means since the price dropped from 20k in december(month number 12), we should expect a price of 9,600,000 (2*10*2*20*12) by mid to late may
