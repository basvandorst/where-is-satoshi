I mean you're more than welcome to show me I'm wrong and that Trump is the primary reason for all of those things. Or you can just build a strawman and declare victory.

Employment has been steadily rising for years before Trump. It would have hit that level regardless of who became President.
  


  
Google a graph of the S&amp;P500 from 2009 to now. And by the way, the stock market will always be at record levels as long as the economy is growing. That's kinda how economics works. 
  


  
It's laughable to attribute this to Trump. Anyone that has followed foreign policy at all in the past two years knows that ISIS has been on a downswing since early 2016. The sieges of Mosul and Raqqa were planned during the Obama administration and would have been effective regardless of who the US president happened to be.
  


  
This is kind of a bizarre thing to give Trump credit for. Do you think the DOJ and FBI weren't doing this until Trump took over?


  
It's easy to create tax cuts that benefit most people when you can take out a $1.5 trillion loan to just pass the cost on to the next generation. Also worth noting that those individual cuts are temporary and start turning into tax increases after eight years (and for some tax payers even earlier).

What a great idea. Hope I win!

Something will make it crash but there's a real question of when. It could be in a few days/weeks or several years.  
  
I used to think that a recession or financial crash would do it but I'm starting to think that a serious enough recession would only lead more people to put money in btc.
