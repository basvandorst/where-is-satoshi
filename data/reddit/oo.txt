The best reason I can find is simplicity. Consider handling double-spending in an architecture using balances. If the balance is B, and we transmit two transactions T1 and T2, both of these transactions can be mined and verified, although illegal depending on whether T1+T2 &gt; B...

_Permissioned_ means that you need credentials to issue transactions. It's still a blockchain, i.e. has a proof-of algorithm.
Surely team C's private keys could get compromised, but the damage would be limited to unspent team-C-transaction-outputs. This 'feature' can only be obtained in a decentralised system, i.e. no master nodes.
This is perhaps the greatest misconception of all: _banks do not trust each other_.

I'm really trying to understand your point, but I don't see it coming across other than blockchain definitions.
So instead, here's an assignment. Describe an architecture that solves the following:
* Ten companies want to send transactions to each other.
* The transactions should be traceable for all parties.
* The transactions are secret, i.e. for they eyes of the ten only.
* The ten don't trust each other, but are willing to assume that a majority of the other companies are honest.

I think it's a lousy argument. Bitcoin "destabilising fiat money" implies a significant portion of global economy flows through the blockchain. Thinking that any democratic government would oppose that development, at that stage, is either naïve or shows little understanding what politics is about.
The opposition we've previously seen against bitcoin has its roots in ignorance and misconceptions. This is changing every day, and the more people learn about blockchain technology, the more they understand that the real innovation here is openness. Secure openness. We see press releases almost every day that I think most of us thought impossible only 12 months ago.
Bitcoin has already happened. It happened in January 2009, and the only thing that stands against bitcoin is vastly superior technology — not politics.

It kind of hurts that this isn't upvoted. Surely the energy is not a waste as it is put to good use — securing value. Nevertheless it's an important discussion, especially in connection to 'how secure does the network need to be'? 
If we had half the hash power and the same level of decentralisation, we would consume half the energy and the network would still be "secure enough".
If we would have 1/1000 of the hash power and a high degree of decentralisation, it would also arguably be secure enough.
Settling for 'not wasteful since creating security' isn't good enough for a sustainable future.

Spontaneous speculation &amp; pump'n'dump aside, these are the three trends I tend to hang on to:
* First one might be considered a bit naïve, but here it goes: Every day another 3600 BTC are created. Assuming bitcoins are priced between $400-$500, one way of looking at things is that __between $1,440,000 and $1,800,000 are entering the bitcoin ecosystem every day__, seemingly without affecting price. Now let's assume we're at the next reward halving, and that the value of the ecosystem increases at the same pace ($1,440,000/day). Then the price of bitcoin would increase by roughly 1 USD every 20 days. (However someone will tell us that this is already calculated into the price.)
* As more and more financial institutions and companies are exploring blockchain tech, they will eventually understand that __blockchains  as an architectural pattern don't make sense unless you keep it open and transparent__. __For every other occasion, there is a better architectural alternative__, and this testifies to the fact that the innovation of bitcoin is really about "secure openness". They will also come to terms with this: there's a limit to the extent of which a new, proof-of-work-based, "open" altchain can rise in the shadow of bitcoin before it becomes an easy target of attack (unless deploying a coordinated merged-mining approach, and by the looks of it, rootstock came to the same conclusion). 
* Classical financial institutions aren't interested in open and transparent, which means that the bitcoin blockchain will be the one and only candidate building up to the classical __recipe of disruption__:
   * openness
   * critical mass
We've already seen this in web development, it's currently happening in hardware hacking, and we have yet to wait for it to happen to 3D printing, energy production and bitcoin. Only this time we're talking about digital assetts, _moving the ownership of value_. Value of what?

Sorry, you're right. For the same reason governments cannot "remove" the internet. Here's my line of reasoning:
OP's scenario takes place when bitcoin begins "to destabilize fiat money". For that to happen, the economy has to reach a point where "corporation driven transactions" go beyond yo-yoing the blockchain. This will happen when bitcoins start to flow _between_ actors in the value chain: manufacturers, distributors, merchants, clients and financial services, without ever leaving the bitcoin economy.
That day, Wall Street will already be just as dependant on Bitcoin as they are on the internet today, and if Wall Street is still Wall Street, bitcoin, and financial applications built upon bitcoin, will already be a factor in politics and political fundraising.
Governments don't have to give away control, they just need to adapt their instruments to the new economy. One such instrument might be launching cryptocurrencies targeting different sectors in society, e.g. a _MortgageCoin_, and simply control its exchange rate (to bitcoin).
This subreddit is full of people thinking that governments are all little satans. To some extent I can empathise, given that most political parties today are ran like corporations where revenues is translated into votes. However both bankers and politicians are also humans striving to maintain a status-quo in a changing enviroment. Just like the rest of us.


But of course it is. I'm comparing bitcoin to bittorrent. These are censorless P2P protocols that solve real problems, i.e. unstoppable to the extent that they can only be replaced by better versions of themselves.


Granted, and perhaps rightly so. The difference is that I don't think that OP's scenario of shutting it down, making it illegal or penalizing businesses is anywhere near realistic. What _is_ realistic, is governments imposing KYC and AML on the point of sale, i.e. merchants are prohibited from accepting transactions that don't meet certain criteria; the wallet software being used, or the history of the bitcoins in the transactions.

Decentralised, no proof-of-work, no blocks i.e. not a blockchain. The hard part is the consensus algorithm. There are multiple approaches but each with its own set of drawbacks.


In 2009 bitcoins were transacted like air, in hundreds or even thousands, between early adopters. On occasion just because you could. Someone even thought it worthwhile to buy a couple of pizzas for 10 000 btc, and at the time, found the deal worthwhile.
Given this climate, what if I would've told you then, that in 7 years, bitcoin would have a market price of over $400, be known to hundreds of millions of people around the world, and be on the front page of New York Times, Wall Street Journal and The Economist? That companies would start issuing stock on the blockchain, that Ingenico would integrate bitcoin into their POS terminals "just in case", or that major TV networks would monitor and report any major price movements?
Surely bitcoin has already taken off, but keep in mind that it's a long journey. Disrupting the global financial network _has_ to take time — we're not talking about a new, global communication medium, or a revolutionizing method to mould plastics at a fraction of the price. We're talking disrupting the pillars of society – global trade, corporate control, world economics, voting, democracy — we're decentralising ownership and adding transparency into the deal, it's huge and I wouldn't want it to go any faster.
Yes. I'm still certain.

That energy is being used to secure value. The value is created by users, applications, merchants, exchanges and bitcoin services.

What we've seen with open source, javascript and the web lately is the phenomenon of "collaborative disruption". Here's the simple recipe:
* Openness
* Critical Mass
There may come a number of private blockchains that are technologically "better" than bitcoin, but as they will be proprietary, it's only a matter of time before the community makes them obsolete.
There's only one thing that worries me, and that's related to openness. We don't have an "evolution pattern". For the free market of open source to really kick in, we must allow code forking, so that islands can form, conquer, merge or be destroyed. So far we've had Pangea. We saw an attempt with the xt fork, but so far it has only managed to rip the community apart.

I'm afraid there's only one way to prove it.
It does sound plausible in my ears though, especially given the period of turbulence we're in: Japan, Switzerland, the czech, the US, Sweden (and surely a bunch of other countries) are trying to boost export by devaluing currencies. There will be national side effects in the short term that we're aware of, but there will also be global consequences that are hard to predict.
The world's currencies are interrelated, and actions of devaluing/revaluing is equal to changing parameters in a massive, international differential equation. Repercussions...
There are a couple of other reasons why I believe in bitcoin:
* Banks are making it their multi-billion dollar business to impede instant money transfers. It's called floating, and as long as banks have that sentiment, instant transfers between two persons just won't happen on a global scale. FX is big business.
* It's time for the banking industry to be the target of a disruptive technology. Legacy banks of today tend to be run like, and have the structure of, any international company in the 1970s. They've since long forgotten how to innovate since there's no need to. While most industry sectors underwent massive changes from a business development perspective during the 80s and 90s (rethinking distribution, outsourcing retail channels, renewed positioning, decreasing vertical expansion), banks never had a reason to. "Innovation" has been limited to acquiring insurance companies. Just the fact that "universal bank" is a term. What other industry areas still have "universal" companies?
I think the block chain, along with its side chains, is that technology, and I think the people will be the winners. To my knowledge, the financial sector never had as many startups and young entrepreneurs engaged as today. Disruptive technologies create jobs, move money, redistribute wealth and bring humanity one more step up the socio-economic ladder.
* I'm hoping that the transparency that the block chain provides could cast a spotlight at what I think is the single biggest perturbation to democracy: lobbying.

Nothing. That's why it happened. On that note, this whole mess of credit expansion is an effect of deregulations.


Control is the illusion, not safety. Think about it. There is no difference between regulations applying to financial institutions and laws, the constitution/amandments/bill of rights applying to you and me.
Imagine a world without laws. Is that really where you want to be? Financial institutions and major corporations would probably take the lead, making laws and an army of their own, and the root problem that we're actually discussing here would just grow bigger: corruption.

Don't know if this is doable, but here it goes:
1. Each meetup issues colored coins on the blockchain (multiplier of k coins per member).
2. Open Market: meetups trade coins with each other for 45 minutes.
3. Each coin represents "foreign agenda time" during coming meetups throughout the year, i.e. meetups are buying time in other user meetups agendas. For every "foreign" coin that a meetup possesses, that foreign meetup commits to listening to/taking part of product presentations, startup presentations, giving feedback on products, focus groups, user testing, or anything that the buyer of the coins wishes.
Example: Los Angeles Bitcoin (Santa Monica) has 1040 members, meaning they issue 1040 coins. The Stockholm Bitcoin meetup (270 coins) are interested in marketing their startups in Santa Monica, so they buy themselves 200 Santa Monica coins. (It turns out Santa Monica coins quickly become quite pricey, as more meetups are interesting in buying their agenda time.)
The Santa Monicans consequently commit to giving Stockholm 200 minutes (or a multiplier thereof) of their agenda time, divided between meetups throughout the remainder of the year. The Stockholm meetup can now use this time to market their local startups overseas, finding partners and building networks.

@_date: 2015-05-22 01:00:54
Firstly, you may be right. For sake of discussion let me give a couple of arguments:
If you're going for financial institutions you need a way in. Either you have a team of sales people ready to call, e-mail, call, network, call, go for lunches and call again. You need a lot of stamina (VC) to pull this through, and even if you do, I think you're way too early to approach these organisations top-down.
Top-down... The most aggressive blockchain startup I've "experienced" so far is Ripple, and they too are having difficulties getting through the doorstep:
* Generally, the management level of financial institutions's have a weak understanding of what the blockchain can be used for, even less so colored coins. The traction the blockchain's gotten lately isn't because it's a neat architectural pattern, it's because of VC attention.
* Everybody in this sector are busy meeting new regulatory rules — I've never seen this many compliance-driven projects before. There simply isn't any room for anything else.
At least I _think_ that there's not one company selling blockchain solutions that can stand on it's own legs. I would even like to doubt anyone of them has a paying customer on any level deeper than building a proof of concept.
There are other ways into an enterprise than through management. If you're going down that road; as long as your business model is closed-source, your biggest challenge is procurement management.
I wouldn't look so much at what others are doing, because so far, none of them has a track record worthy of copying.
Lastly, some constructive criticism — take it or leave it: In conjunction with management's weak understanding of the blockchain and colored coins, I would probably have a pass at your home page along with a good copywriter. I understand that you want to be general, but instead of going for every target group, you risk missing them all. I miss real world examples of what you're trying to solve. No one will raise the hand at the question "do you need help to leverage the security of the blockchain to transfer value independant of the underlying Bitcoin"? (Which is basically the first thing you're saying.) "What value? Security? We are already secure enough. Open assets? Transfer value? That's what we do – we're a financial institution! What underlying Bitcoin — we want the blockchain!"
So basically you're addressing an audience that knows what colored coins are, understand the blockchain, already understands how it would apply to my organisation, and who tick for HD key management BIP-41 HD P2SH.
I don't think there is such an audience. Yet. It's harder than one might think to see how a piece of technology might fit into 'business as usual'. You'd have to be really concrete, especially at this early stage that we're in.
Anyway, I wish you all the luck and success. This technology is here to stay, and guys like you will make it happen. The question is when.. :&gt;
@_date: 2015-05-19 11:22:21

Just my $0.05: I'm thinking that you need to find a business model allowing you to open source everything if you're serious about gaining traction.

The technology may be radical, but the idea of a fixed-supply monetary system is not. We were there just 500 years ago ("individual control of property and consensus across the network of a basic set of rules") and it wasn't all that great
I'm not here to disagree, but consider what society would be like without fractional reserve banking, and please do it with a mind wide open. I think it's safe to say that deflation is just one obstacle in a world of constant shortage of money, and I doubt the little money available would cover average Joe's car, flat and college tuition fee.
So how would that affect middle class? What would that do to living standards? How would cash eventually be distributed in a society where you're depending on other people's/institutions' existing, hard-earned cash as soon as you're planning on investing?
Who would lend money to Joe blanco, knowing he wants to buy a Hummer H3? I for one would like to know how creditworthy he is, i.e. I would need to perform my own KYC, and I would then compare Joe's car investment to the prospect of investing in Tesla, Apple, Google or some hyped start-up.
I think Joe would have a hard time financing his car, and for that reason consumption would plummet, and we know what that leads to.
My point is that you have no idea what a modern society "freed" from fractional reserve banking would look like, or for that matter how "modern" such a society would really prove to be. Nor do I or anyone else, but I know that the ability to control cash supply has saved the day on numerous occasions.

I disagree. Compliance means control of financial operations, either institutions or its customers, for instance increasing transparency (FATCA, Dodd Frank, MiFID), transparency for customers (CCD), customer security (PCI DSS) or harmonisation across markets (SEPA).
If bitcoin were created to remove "this arbitrary control" it would've died at hello. On the contrary, bitcoin doesn't stand in the way of compliance directives (which is a good thing).
"Non-compliant operations" by either banks or their customers _may lead to_ seizing of funds, and this is where bitcoin is a game changer. However since bitcoin moves the control of capital from _centralised debt to decentralised credit_, crypto-currencies will drive the need for new directives. Compliance will not go away.
Compliance will not go away, rather the opposite, and if we play with the idea that compliance directives for institutions handling crypto-currencies were already in place, Mt Gox might not have happened.

Those are the cases you tend to hear about. In reality, banks reimburse the absolute majority (I'm talking 95%+) of fraud victims. Often enough, fraud is due to carelessness of the victim. Banks are very aware of the shortcomings of credit cards, still, they do what they can to uphold the creditability of credit cards.

Bitcoin in your context is 'just a currency', with the addition that you may need to prove that you really own the assets that you claim (that you are in possession of the private keys). Just like you already do with your car, your boat, your flat or your income — all in order to get a rating as good as possible.

Not on the side of conspiracies. This subreddit is infested with opinionated "experts" who have the perfect solution for bitcoin's future. They will gladly tell you how to solve each and every problem. They're not only smarter than the core developer, but they also assume the right to dictate what the core devs _should_ be doing. Yet none of them has written one line of code.
If it's frustrating just angry-posting at reddit, imagine the stress Gregory, Mike or Gavin must experience. r/bitcoin'ers are typically anonymous, but Gregory, Mike and Gavin don't have that luxury. They're public, and I bet their friends and families both know, and sometimes question, what they're spending their spare time on. At least they are upstanding enough to put their name behind their opinions. So Mike eventually leaving doesn't come as a surprise — there's eventually a breaking point to trying to satisfy an idiocracy.
And this, this post, just takes the prize: So acting jury in the block size debate wasn't enough? Now we want blood, and OP is trying to extend the jury role to that of judge. 
Again, OP wishes to remain anonymous and is asking someone else to do his bidding. And comparing Mike, acting unpaid in an open-source, voluntary project, to a seven-digit-salary-employee in a multi-million corporation acting under an employment contract and usually an NDA, is beyond ungrateful.

If you mean successful as in bitcoin being _the_ currency... historically, being able to control the supply of cash has proven quite handy from time to time, especially in confidence-chicken-or-the-egg scenarios when unemployment dictates inflation and the other way around (for instance US and Germany in the 20s-30s).
With bitcoin, you lose that ability. It could however be argued that in a world ruled by bitcoin, you won't need that ability. Economic cycles would still exist, but as they wouldn't be driven by artificial cash supply, they would be more moderate.

There has probably never been a moment in time when financial institutions spent so much money and effort in 'compliance projects' as they do today. The result is that there is little room for innovation or new products, but there is also an up-side: these banks are building up structural capital in terms of compliance that is nearly impossible for a small start-up to adopt. Just ESMAs discussion and consultations papers on MiFID are about 800 pages.

You're linking to a blog post which states that:


I can think of plenty of reasons that would cause the exchange rate between two commodities to fluctuate. Speculation for one.
My case for why Bitcoin will take over the world is much simpler: Because Bitcoin brings advantages to retailers and individuals that no other currencies does, it will experience a steady growth. Eventually that growth will yield the volume, or depth, needed to stabilize the currency. That will be our tipping point.
In order for that to happen, we need to make Bitcoin simpler, more accessible and more approachable.

Right now, if we're talking going mainstream, there's only room for one cryptocurrency, and bitcoin is the only one with enough traction.
Moreover. Borderless, programmable and atomic transactions. 
No existing payment network that I know of offers atomic transactions: There's literally no way I can get my colored-coin digital plane ticket without paying. The payment _is_ the settlement, _and_ the receipt, _and_ the product bought.
@_date: 2016-01-22 21:58:24
It's not the size of blocks that drive CPU usage and bandwidth, it's the increasing number of transactions.
These transaction need to be mined and propagated in one way or the other. Three possible approaches:
    1) Increase block size
    2) Decrease block time
    3) Compress/rationalise blocks
Classic suggests addressing 1 first and 3 later.
Core suggests addressing 3 first and 1 later.
No one is talking about number 2.
To me, the key is just the following: we're not seeking a scalable solution, we're just seeking scale (i.e. to buy time), until we can get off-chain transactions going (e.g. DMC or LN).
Ok, so I wrote until here and thought to myself: hey, why don't we zip the blocks? That way we could lower block size significantly. I started googling and ended up in [this thread on bitcointalk]( which refers to mentioning that passing indices instead of full blocks (most nodes already have all the block candidate transactions in their mempool, and the ones they don't have they should be able to request) would render blocks of about 4kB instead of 1MB.

I think the _fundamental_ question is: "Is there a market for an open-source infrastructure for transferring digital ownership, free to innovate upon?"
Another take, as services provided by the internet today are largely financed by advertising, is this: "is there a market for a global internet currency enabling quick and easy micro payments?".
Oh yes there is. Regarding catching on, all it takes is for the right supplier to say "we only accept bitcoin". The [backpage effect]( of summer 2015 comes to mind...

Yes. We've reached a point where we've put a name to the concept of [planned obsolescence]( and consumers seem to accept it. Consumerism incidentally keeps an even pace with production with our throw-away society and pay later culture, as your pointing out.
If that is not a symptom of an ailing society, then what is?


We've had a number of bank bailouts, and that is outright corruption for sure. Still, a surplus of cash has benefits that are less obvious, and I think one fruit of these benefits is the furious pace at which we progress in for instance the fields of medicine, computing, machinery, chemistry, materials science/engineering. Money makes the world go round, and fractional reserve banking is its artificial lubricant.
A lot of people are upset with the monetary system, and by all means. I think that's sane and good will come out of it — a better tomorrow, because today's tomorrow simply isn't sustainable. We just need to be really cautious and think twice before deciding to abolish fractional reserve banking. (Micro-loans as pizzaface18 suggested is not even close to a replacement.)
How's this for a manifesto:
* Privately owned companies should not be allowed to do fractional reserve banking.
* The reserve ratio should be drastically increased.
* The reserve ratio should be governed by market performance. Not politics.
* We need to think through how KYC and AML really should work in a sustainable economy.
   * Campaign contributions, polical party contributions, politicians' incomes and lobby contributions should be fully transparent through bitcoin's blockchain, and followed up so that a campaign, party or politicians doesn't spend more money than accounted for.
   * A blockchain should also be used to increase corporate transparency. I imagine being able to scan a bar code of for instance a food product and, through a public ledger, get information of the origin of every ingredient of that product, where it was bought, when, from whom, and at what price.
* While we're at it, corporations should be obliged by law to disclose their net margin, for every product, in every store, printed on the product's price tag.

Since the beginning of 2016, the virtual currency has fallen into a sort of civil war. The conflict boils down to whether bitcoin's source code is in need of change.
Over the last year, a number of eminent developers have issued warnings that bitcoin will hit the roof. Most notably Mike Hearn, a heavyweight in the business, as he departed from the community in January [pronouncing the currency dead](
What is causing the issue? Simplified, it's about bitcoin's codebase being ill-equipped for the fast growth of the number of transactions.
A bitcoin transaction is confirmed each time a miner unlocks a new block of coins. Each block contains roughly 1 MB. Critics have it that 1 MB is too little and that the block size needs to increase to 2 MB.
The issue can be compared to a over busy railroad, and therefore needs to go from a single track to double tracks.
The previous week has proven the critics right. The time for confirming a transaction has increased from 10 minutes to more than half an hour. Some web shops that previously accepted bitcoin [have ceased doing so](
So why doesn't the bitcoin community simply increase the block size to 2 MB? The answer is found in the infected conflict of two fractions – Classic and Core.
Core, mostly represented by persons behind the original code, want to keep the 1 MB rule.
On the other side there's Classic, bringing forward their own, modified version of the code, containing an increase to 2 MB.
Both parties accuse the other side of performing overload attacks against the hostile codebase in order to convey the image that it is non-functional.
So far there is no peace on the horizon. It is however clear that bitcoin as a currency takes damage as long as the battle continues. For anyone considering investing in a bitcoin company, the risk has increased significantly.

You surely picked a bad time to post – the entire subreddit is glued to the charts right now.
Self motivation is not enough. You also need a guarantee that fellow participants aren't trying to screw you. Proof-of-work takes care of this to the extent that you can have a network consisting of 49% crooks, and it would still be reliable.
Proof of work allows you to blindly trust that someone said something at a specific moment in time, analogous to how kidnappers like to take a photo of a victim holding today's paper. Whether what was said is true is another story. It works fine in the case of digital assets, however real world assets is a different story: you can prove that someone _said_ that they are in possession of a diamond or a piece of art, but you can't _know_ that they are.

Oh, as long as settlement takes place elsewhere than on the blockchain, it's quite a trivial pattern. Financial institutions must move both clearing and settlement onto the blockchain in order for it to make sense, and that implies bearer tokens.
AFAIK, the whole 'blockchain without bitcoin' discussion is about bitcoin as a means of decentralisation, in effect coinbases. I'm saying that banks can decentralise a blockchain among themselves without getting a monetary reward – the reward is the shared ledger.

I'm not entirely sure an adult wrote it, however I'll make a try: I haven't read the entire piece, but so far it's heavily opinionated and dogmatic, and makes a poor attempt at carrying a debate. It outlines the world in brush strokes far too broad, and in doing so, generalises reality into blacks and whites to an extent that I want to take the opposing side. Roughly every paragraph contains nuisances that makes me lose the thread:


What? The author and I are clearly moving in different circles. My impression is that "people at the top of democracy" still have no idea what bitcoin is, and the first thing that comes to their minds are still darknet, drugs and money laundering.


Are they now? I doubt Jamie Dimon comes into work every morning feeling humiliated. We're still waiting for the first bank to touch bitcoin the currency with a 10-inch pole, and it's far too volatile and brand-soiled to offer a value proposition in the global financial scheme.


Yes you can. Banks may trust their counter parties, but not necessarily third parties. Just having consensus over a distributed ledger will work wonders for post-trade operations, settlement and reconciliation. Granted proof-of-work might not be the best option in a world of semi-trust. Bitcoin is both a currency and a means of keeping the blockchain decentralised; banks have other incentives to keep the blockchain decentralised.


The article is full of these statements that just makes me cry: "source?" (And common sense, gut feelings, and "I've browsed some of their web sites, and the front page lists "belief in absolute authority" among their key-values" is not a good source.)


Again, source? I have no problems sketching an architecture in which a blockchain and MySQL would make sense. Keep in mind that the blockchain is a slow, cumbersome software architecture that merely solves the problem of distributed consensus. I.e. don't put data on the blockchain that aren't in dire need of distributed consensus – or – consider putting hashes on the blockchain for distributed consensus and traceability, and put the actual data in a database. There are loads of architecural domains in which this makes sense. Again, the world isn't black and white once you look beyond cryptocurrencies.


It's not a safe bet, and the world isn't black or white.


I might be wrong, but I don't think Satoshi Nakamoto marketed bitcoin with "a deep dissatisfaction with the fiat currency system that steals money from the poor, fuels war and destroys economies". What I do know is that a lot of the early adopters were libertarians, some of them of the more extreme kind, and I suppose this has contributed to the brand of bitcoin.


This article is clearly not the work of an academic. If the author insist with statements like the one above, I will insist with having proof. In this case, the author is left to prove that "there are NO men who understand what money is who did NOT expect collapses like Lehman Brothers", which is patently absurd.


I fail to see the connection between Austrian School of Economics and the housing collapse. Any Neo-Keynesian, or child for that matter, would have seen the housing collapse if they had insight into the MBS's, the ponzi lendings and the dysfunctional business incitements of the rating institutions.


I don't know what the author is trying to prove. Bernanke had answers to every question asked; the loans were in fact over-collateralised, the terms were already published, and the point Sanders was trying to make was reduced to disclosing the lendees.


*YEAH!! EVERYONE KNOWS IT!!*


 supply of money
Fractional reserve banking provides *liquidity* to the world's most common, sought and traded commodity: money. If that's a bad thing, I'd like to see an article discussing the pros and cons of fractional reserve banking – one that reasons that the fantastic economic growth in trade, living conditions and innovation that we've witnessed since the early 70:ies – would also have been possible with a static cryptocurrency. I doubt the author is ready to take that discussion.
 regulation of banks
Travel back to the beginning of the 20th century when there were virtually nothing regulating companies' issuing of stocks and bonds, or the money-laundering of crime syndicates, or when banks had no obligation to account for their risk undertakings to anyone.
I'm not excluding the fact that there might be corruption involved (or lobbying for that matter, which is just an open form of corruption) in the area of regulations of financial institutions, but if it were up to the banks, the only regulations in play would be those preventing others from starting banks. The European Union is currently working towards opening up, in effect creating conditions for competition within the financial sector.


So _this_ is what destoyed the value of the US Dollar? Again, the world isn't black or white. It might also be that the Federal Reserve “stimulus” programmes, along with secret bailouts, are in fact a life support machine for the value of the US Dollar, which would have plummeted in the wake of Lehman, the housing bubble or the car industry crisis.


Ok, this is where I stopped reading. The scrollbar hints of an article that goes on and on, but all it succeeds in doing is provoking me. The author is either out to provoke or simply hasn't seen enough of the world to incorporate nuances.
And yes, I would also like to see bitcoin become a world currency, but not because "we are right and the stupid bankers should die", but because there is room for bitcoin. It solves a real problem.

I'm not defending anything, I'm asking for a nuanced line of reasoning instead of a rant. There are patterns in the crumbling fiat monetary system that bitcoin in itself cannot replace, and these patterns need replacement badly. The author touches on the subject but seems rather clueless. If you're asking for my personal opinion, in 10 years time payments will no longer pass under the definition of 'core banking'. And yes, fractional reserve banking has its merits in providing liquidity. 
I've been around internet long enough not to get provoked by blogs and forums, I am however annoyed when an author enters into a really interesting topic, with a really interesting title, and makes me wade through rants instead of nuanced arguments before getting to the point.
Since you don't seem to share that issue, I assume you swallow every word whole-heartedly which does kind of scare me.

As much as I believe in bitcoin, to me, it will never be _that_ currency.
The subject of credit expansion takes a lot of beatings in this subreddit. It does however have a positive side to the extent that it has been a prerequisite for the speed of innovation and growth that we've experienced since we left the gold standard.
Our society's speed of innovation _demands_ those 97% (maybe not 97, but nevertheless a supply of capital that bitcoin has been carefully "designed against").
In my version of the future, there will be separate currencies, or side chains if you will, for things like mortgages. You will still want tools to stimulate parts of a nation's economy, however without "leaking" money between different sectors in society.
These separate currencies can still be decentralised, but connected to bitcoin and have an exchange rate. Without tools and options like these, governments will never agree to take cryptocurrencies to a national level.

Rough translation:
__David meets Goliath in the battle of bitcoin__
__On Thursday, an EU statement may determine whether bitcoin changers should be forced to pay VAT. It all started with a question that developer David Hedqvist asked three years ago.__
On Thursday, a court proposal from the European Court of Justice Advocate General on whether the exchange of bitcoin be excluded VAT duty or not. The question has long been in the European and Swedish bureaucracy for years.
Behind the process is software developer David Hedqvist and the question he asked in 2013.
In addition to his job, he runs the site bitcoin.se, which is an information site and a forum for the virtual currency Bitcoin. Three years ago he was considering expanding with a switching service for bitcoin, and to find out if he would have to account for VAT David Hedqvist turned to the Swedish Tax Agency.
–But I got a vague answer, so I wrote to the Tax Board to get clearance. About a year later came a message positive message, he says.
The Tax Board ruled that Bitcoin is a means of payment and that the exchange should therefore be exempted VAT obligations. But the Tax Agency argued that the Board interpreted the EU directives on the matter wrong and appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court - and urged that it would turn to the European Court for a preliminary ruling.
–We disagreed with the Board's reasoning. Then we thought it was also important to get a clarity about Bitcoin and VAT, says Martin Loeb, legal expert at the Swedish Tax Agency.
Today, David Hedqvist is at the end of a legal process in which his arguments stand against those by the Swedish government, Germany and Estonia. To help him, he has one of Stockholm's most prestigious corporate law firms. The costs are covered by companies in the bitcoin business, all of which would benefit from a positive outcome.
–It is important for them because it applies to their commission as shifting business to be subject to VAT. It is also important for bitcoin from a broader perspective, if it is to be equated with other currencies, although this only concerns the VAT bit, says David Hedqvist.
–But for your part, is it a commercial motive or Bitcoin's position as a currency which is the driving force?
–I think it would be fun if bitcoin had a chance on equal terms. It is a challenger to  banks and credit card companies — an industry in need of competition and new blood.
–It is also important that the new technology is not stopped by laws and regulations that are lagging behind, says David Hedqvist.
The EU Court is not bound to comply with the General court proposal, but it usually weighs heavily when the judges make their decision.
Although the ECJ would ultimately judge David Hedqvist advantage, he is not sure he will complete the plans and start the exchange service.
–We'll see. I am remaking the site but there are other ways to make money on that domain than exchanging, he says, and continues:
–I would be happy if there was a judgment in our favor. It would have been fun to have contributed in some way.

Don't blow this out of proportion — this is just RT speculating. Apparently they had no news to report, so they went ahead and made some.
Yes, Citibank created Citicoin – they realise they need to learn cryptocurrencies, and what better way to familiarise 240 000 employees than with a sandbox crypto used for internal billing, project management and cost allocations between departments?
Taking it from there to "Citibank set to destroy Bitcoin" is a huge and misguided step.

I'm too cool for sources. No but seriously, I've been involved in AML projects in the (non-shadow) banking sector. When opening accounts for new customers, the bank is obliged to document the origin of the customer's funds going into that account. In the fiat world, the bank is left to ask and trust the customer.
AML/KYC is a real hazzle though – not because of the direct costs involved, or the cumbersome process, but because it prevents digital onboarding (banks are left physical meetings, and that's not quite where the world is heading). Every question the bank can leave out is one step closer to digital onboarding.
As for origin of funds, if the bank can answer that question without asking the customer, they definitely will.

In fact I've skipped buying online content not because the merchant wouldn't accept bitcoin, but because the merchant didn't generate a QR code for me — I pay everything with my mobile, and if I have to copy a bitcoin address, paste it into a note, to-do or something, sync the note with my iPhone, access the note on the phone, copy the bitcoin address, go to wallet, paste address, pay, I might as well have entered all my VISA information in the same time.

Right, since AML rules were written with fiat in mind – I guess no one at the time could imagine a wholly transparent, global cryptocurrency with history/audit built into the protocol.
To develop that thought: today we're using bitcoin in the same way we're using fiat: moving money without context, as the context takes place in a subsequent transaction (goods). However thanks to the bitcoin protocol, we can and will do things so much better: atomic transactions enable us to go from moving money to representing trades on the blockchain, still in one single transaction. Inputs would be person A's bitcoins and organisation B's movie ticket, and outputs would be person A's newly bought movie ticket, and organisations B's compensation for that ticket in bitcoin.
Instead of movie tickets it's easy to imagine a simple receipt, or an ownership of a domain name, or a 30-day AWS token.
I think AML rules written with bitcoin in mind will definitely take advantage of its history feature. In that case, a significant part of AML in cryptoland will be the governance of bitcoin exchanges — the faucets of the bitcoin ecosystem. By regulating them to perform atomic transactions, in effect having them color a transaction with a receipt if someone jumps into the bitcoin ecosystem from a (by paying with) some anonymous shadowy cryptocurrency.
Anonymous cryptocurrencies are a different story. They will have to seek  their own path, and I'd be very surprised if they ever find their way into the world economy.

Quick analysis: I'd say no, this is something new. Apart from the throughput, this solution can incorporate documents beyond smart contracts. This is the kind of solution you would need in order to digitalize an existing business process relying on unstructured data as value tokens, i.e. faxes, e-mails and letters. Once on the blockchain, that business process can selectively replace arbitrary process steps, currently relying on documents, in favour of smart contracts.
Moving the business process onto the blockchain is in itself a win, , even without converting process steps to smart contracts. You would get governance, security, non-infringement, analytics, availability and archiving/records management "out of the box". 
I think they're on to something.

Bitcoin companies are already getting a fast-track to 'official' compliance, hence the term shadow banking.

Well, judging by top-level comments in this post, three out of six definitely think things can be clearer:




The design is flawed. My suggestion is to present _just the amount field and the submit button_ as the only interactive objects. There could be an additional explanation that the user can leave personal information upon donating. It's a better design pattern _for the task of receiving donations through bitcoin_.


If the target group is exclusively people who are comfortable using charity web sites then they shouldn't change anything.
This is my last post on the subject, but I want to point out that there are different drivers for adopting bitcoin. One of them is anonymity. A web site that attempts to associate a bitcoin address with the personal information of its owner, for no obvious reason, is probably not a good idea. In that case, those form fields should at least have "OPTIONAL" written all of them in flashing, green letters against a red background.

With current volumes you're absolutely right. I think the amount of micropayments is going to explode, once the infrastructure and wallet software are there, and I think energy and media distribution along with the internet of things will be the key drivers.
For revenue to happen, they need to retain their current monopoly: the payment channels. Especially if they get to keep most of the profit due to cheaper infrastructure. (Part of the business model might be providing that infrastructure, in the same direction that energy companies are heading.)
The outlook depends on what alternatives are in place, i.e. they need to get rid of the bitcoin blockchain.

What's worrying me is that banks have no intention of solving fractional reserves, and they certainly have their own ideas of how to solve modern economic problems (and in the process, creating them).
Early adopters of bitcoin were and are driven by these issues, but we have seen that ideology alone is not enough to reach critical mass. The community has done an amazing job creating potential killer apps such as streamium, social tipping, remittance, easy paywalls and other micro payment solutions unavailable/unviable in fiat land. What worries me is that R3 will all of sudden be able to compete in this area, and it will certainly appeal to average banked Joe when they release their first Mobile Dollar Wallet, vouched for by both well-known banks and governments.
If this is where we're heading, I think bitcoin's only chance to flourish is via the third world. The unbanked.
And, say what one will about fractional reserve banking, but I doubt we would have seen this increase in wealth, both materialistic and scientific, without it. A seemingly never-ending cash supply enables research, construction, manufacturing, logistics, and expansion — in the end globalisation. A system with a limited money supply has little to offer here, so the big question is: can we really claim that a limited money supply is better in the long run? Sure, we won't be able to 'spend  tomorrow's money today', but that also means that I will take humanity longer to reach some sort of singularity.
Just looking for a good discussion =)

I'm not worried about splitting bitcoins, surely there are enough decimals for all of us to get around. I'm worried about applying for a mortage:
* In the world of fractional reserves, the bank has the ability to extend its mortgage stock, in effect approving, say 1 out of every 3 loan requests — if my request is among the 33% most attractive requests, it will be approved.
* In the world of fixed money supply, the bank has to match its lending to its receiving of deposits to the dime. In effect, a mortgage request is much more likely to be denied. Even if I'm a safe bet from the bank's perspective, I might have to wait in line until the bank is solvent enough to approve my application.
The global economy would slow down to an extent that we've never seen before in modern time. I'm not saying it's a bad thing in the western part of the world. I'm just saying that the fractional reserve system has its upsides if we can just see past whom it benefits the most.


In this case, the borrower is the beneficiary (apart from the bank), having the luxury of spending this newly created money first.

I'd state it already falls within the definition: bitcoin has value because "it is valued and accepted by others".
The vast amounts of electricity is just a brute-force solution to decentralisation (and not a very good one either since mining is an economy of scale).
Don't get me wrong though: proof-of-work is break-through discovery, and it's the best we can do. For now. Last I checked, Ethereum's Casper release might be on to a proof-of-stake solution, bulkier but faster, and unfortunately one that doesn't offer a clear separation between securing the network and participating in its application ecosystem (hence shouldn't be used for "certain gambling applications").
Nevertheless, Casper's PoS doesn't have to be better or as good as PoW. It just has to be good enough.

Everything can be regulated, so let's introduce the term 'effectively regulated':
Bitcoin the protocol cannot be effectively regulated. Bitcoin the currency is already regulated (that's why we need to go through KYC/AML when purchasing coins from faucets).
The thing is that while bitcoin would survive all kinds of regulations, it would harm the movement and consign bitcoin to shady places.

Agreed, this is a mere case of regulation that's fallen behind. Technically Swanson's right, again, and it's annoying that he's found 2-3 really weak caveats that allows him to draw the conclusion of what will be passed on to the banking community: bitcoin is not compliant.

I read it twice. So maybe he's found some controversial idea, but it simply doesn't come across. I fail to see how or why a distributed ledger ("automated" just like any computer protocol) would super-transform corporations, and the article doesn't help me.

With cryptocurrencies, there would be no need for letter of credits as the funds would be bearer tokens on the blockchain. That way, clearing and settlement could also take place on the blockchain.
Also, the bank's role as escrow party becomes obsolete as the trading parties could create an escrow contract. In case they would still want an arbitrator, that role is better filled by a trade union, an embassy or an independent solicitor.
There are also a lot of "approval" steps in the showcase. Taking this to the bitcoin blockchain becomes rather absurd: "It's your lucky day — I approve the bitcoins you sent me", or "Ok, I approve of the signature that beyond any cryptological doubt proves that you own them."

I feel kinda stupid – help me out. If I run a ledger of digital proofs of car ownerships, and someone has their car stolen, the ledger would point out the true owner of the car.
If the digital proof of car ownership gets stolen (through a transaction), noone can reverse that transaction since this blockchain is censorship-resistant. So for that specific token, the blockchain is no longer legally authoritative — provided I can prove that the token was in fact stolen from me. Hmm, ok, I get it now.

blockchain = distributed ledger + consensus algorithm + cryptography
Whether this consensus algorithm should be decentralized or not, and whether the blockchain should be open or closed, is the talk of the industry. This discussion involves just about every blockchain misconception there is.
R3 is not avoiding the word "blockchain", it's just too early to ask. R3 seeks to develop a financial network based on cryptography. As the final product is up to its participants, namely 20 something multinational corporations, they're simply not at the point of deciding what their distributed ledger should look like.

I think bitcoin's real USP comes as a consequence of bitcoin being first, and is first to reach critical mass: __the computing power behind bitcoin makes it impossible for a second, proof-of-work-based cryptocurrency to ever gain traction.__ All it takes is for one farm to divert their miners, take 51% of that cryptocurrency and it's history.

A blockchain needs a lubricant if it is to stay decentralised, _provided that the parties do not trust each other_.
Banks already have a trusted network. So what is the point of having a blockchain if you don't need 'permissionless'? Surely there must be other, faster architectural patterns.
The way I see it, banks have already lost the segment of payments (they just don't know it yet). The big question is: how much will banks have to transform to be in business in 15 years?
Most bitcoin startups are solving problems that private individuals tend to have — payments, financing, FX, securities, escrows. My guess is that the banks' blockchain experiment will do the same for savings, financing to some degree, and merchant banking e.g. cash pooling, interest pooling products, currency swaps products.
Point is, banks are starting talking to each other, and slowly realising that they will need to up their game. The first victim won't be banks, it will be clearing houses.

The blockchain architecture greatly alleviates the complexity of concurrent writes by forcing outputs to be fully spent each time.

Situations like these are a good reminder that bitcoin cannot be censored, and that's one of the most important reasons why bitcoin is here to stay.
Another important aspect is that bitcoin is pseudonymous, just like the internet, and eventually a prerequisite for bitcoin to become accepted at state level.
I will always wonder how much thought Satoshi Nakamoto invested into these matters. Two years down the road, it still amazes me how he managed to balance the properties of this currency just perfectly.
If there is any intrinsic value in bitcoin, it's about free speech — being able to express yourself financially.

 Banks to America’s Firms: We Don’t Want Your Cash
__Profit-crunching low interest rates have banks judging cash too costly to keep__
By JULIET CHUNG And  SARAH KROUSE
Oct. 18, 2015 5:38 a.m. ET
U.S. banks are going to new lengths to ward off a surprising threat to their financial health: big cash deposits.
State Street Corp., the Boston bank that manages assets for institutional investors, for the first time has begun charging some customers for large dollar deposits, people familiar with the matter said. J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., the nation’s largest bank by assets, has cut unwanted deposits by more than $150 billion this year, in part by charging fees.
The developments underscore a deepening conflict over cash. Many businesses have large sums on hand and opportunities to profitably invest it appear scarce. But banks don’t want certain kinds of cash either, judging it costly to keep, and some are imposing fees after jawboning customers to move it.
The banks’ actions are driven by profit-crunching low interest rates and regulations adopted since the financial crisis to gird banks against funding disruptions.
The latest fees center on large sums deemed risky by regulators, sometimes dubbed hot-money deposits thought likely to flee during times of crises. Finalized last September and overseen by the Federal Reserve and other regulators, the rule involving the liquidity coverage ratio forces banks to hold high-quality liquid assets, such as central bank reserves and government debt, to cover projected deposit losses over 30 days. Banks must hold reserves of as much as 40% against certain corporate deposits and as much as 100% against some deposits from hedge funds.
“At some point you wonder whether there will be a shortage of financial institutions willing to take on these balances,” said Kelli Moll, head of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP’s hedge-fund practice in New York, saying that where to hold cash has become an increasing topic of conversation as hedge funds are shown the door by long-time banking counterparties.
The push comes as the globe is awash in cash, reflecting soft economic growth and low interest rates that limit investment. Some asset managers have been increasing the amount of cash they are holding in their portfolios, in part because of an increased focus by the Securities and Exchange Commission on liquidity management in mutual funds.
Domestic deposits at U.S. banks in the second quarter hit $10.59 trillion, up 38% from five years earlier, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data show. Loans outstanding at U.S. banks as a share of total deposits tumbled to 71% from 78% in 2010 and 92% in mid-2007, before the financial crisis, the data show.
Jerome Schneider, head of Pacific Investment Management Co.’s short-term and funding desk, which advises corporate and institutional clients, said that as a result of the bank actions, he and his customers have discussed as cash alternatives boosting investments in U.S. Treasury bonds, ultrashort-duration bond funds and money-market funds.
When it comes to cash, Mr. Schneider said, “Clients have been put on warning.”
Auctions for one- and three-month Treasury bills this week sold bills at zero yields, reflecting outsize demand for the securities.
Few banks disclose how much in “nonoperating” deposits they hold. Credit Suisse Group AG analysts estimated in August that the top four U.S. banks by assets hold roughly $650 billion in those deposits that require the highest levels of reserves.
Banks are struggling to generate returns for investors. A low-interest rate environment squeezes bank profits by narrowing the spread between the rate they lend at and their borrowing, or funding, cost.
Some analysts have been predicting rates would rebound, likely boosting bank profits, but that hasn’t happened. This year, slowing growth in China and recessions in some major emerging-market nations have dimmed expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year.
The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index of large commercial banks has dropped about 9% since July as rate-increase expectations waned.
Deposit fees are particularly significant at State Street because its primary business is custodying client assets, including holding cash for clients rather than seeking to lend out those funds, as other banks typically do.
State Street customers earlier were told that fees were possible on accounts whose nonoperational balances had grown, the people familiar with the matter said. There is no minimum deposit size that triggers the fee, which varies and is applied case by case to new and existing clients, the people said.
“The persistence of the current rate environment requires that we take action consistent with prudent financial management with certain accounts that continually maintain significant excessive cash balances,” State Street said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal.
BNY Mellon and Northern Trust haven’t yet begun charging to hold clients’ cash, people familiar with the matter said. A Bank of New York spokesman said the bank hasn’t ruled out doing so in the future. The fees at J.P. Morgan don’t apply to clients of its custody business, a person familiar with the bank said.
Northern Trust has been taking a “transaction by transaction approach” to accepting very large deposits from clients approaching the bank, said Chief Financial Officer S. Biff Bowman on the bank’s second-quarter earnings call in July. A Northern Trust spokesman declined to say whether charges were a possibility in the future.
State Street and others have charged clients on some large euro deposits for more than a year, reflecting a negative interest rate on overnight deposits at the European Central Bank.
In 2011, BNY Mellon set plans to charge a small number of clients for holding their cash, reflecting in part a large flow of deposits triggered by investors’ flight to safety that summer. The bank rolled back the plan without imposing fees after some clients pulled money.
Since last year, Bank of America Corp. has told some institutional clients that they will need to move their deposits or pay to keep them at the bank, people familiar with the matter said. Top executives decided to approach clients that didn’t do other business with the bank.

No bank will ever ask you to transfer your bitcoin to their blockchain. Banks have their mind set entirely on securities. If they're successful, your trades will end up on a private blockchain whether you like it or not.
The bitcoin blockchain is too slow for the banks' use-cases. The reason it is slow is because permissionless comes with a price. Surely we have a couple of tricks to boost the performance in the future, but the fact remains: permissionless will always be slower, and permissionless is something banks can avoid if the choose to.
One day permissionless might be fast enough even for handling VISA loads, but that day has yet to come.
Banks have a point running a permissive blockchain, In that scenario, separating the currency from the blockchain suddenly makes sense.
Bitcoin is a currency __and a governance token__. Banks need neither.

First: I'm glad I found OP:s informative post as your home page and git repo has led me to believe that BigchainDB is production-ready.
Second: you don't need to, and probably shouldn't, _decentralise_ storage – just make sure it's properly and safely _distributed_. I don't know what specific use-cases your designing for, but proper and secure distribution, along with being able to have a blockchain part public and part private, will put you in front of a mass market (regardless of what people in this sub say).

Horizontal clustering usually increases performance/throughput. In the blockchain case, scaling leaves performance intact.

I'm basically trying to find out if a private, permissive blockchain can somehow be pegged to other blockchains such as bitcoin at a later stage. The answer to that question is also the answer to the following question: "What do banks have to lose in choosing a private, permissive blockchain?".

Comparing bitcoin-core to bitcoin-ng: in the ng case, the attacker knows which node to DoS (the one currently signing the tx blocks). In the core case, there's no way of knowing which node will find the next block = more resilient to DoS attacks.

Instead, move the conversion issue further along the value chain:  Persuade a few grocery shops in the Philippines to accept bitcoin. They will get a huge load of business. Others will follow suit.
Someone will still have to do the conversion (the shops), but this time in bulk, netting, adding greater incentives.

This is really interesting. My first reaction is that IBM built a vision carrying blinders, and that they _still_ haven't grasped the value proposition of blockchains. Add a crypto currency onto that same blockchain, and half of the steps and actors are all of a sudden obsolete.
Nevertheless, IBM presents an interesting mid-transition view, and they know to go where the money is: Deploy this app onto existing trade infrastructure and it would make a huge difference to how international trade is done today.

Shared databases have been around since the mid-70ies. A blockchain allows a shared database to be fully open and fully decentralised. Fully open means than anyone can read from and write to the database. Fully decentralised means that no node has more mojo than any other node.

Payments will be the first major bitcoin disruption. It has already begun, and VISA knows it. Right now they're trying to assess where it will all end.
VISA lost their innovation vein some 30 years ago, and have since then been occupied with maintaining a marketshare status quo. Now here they are, serious subject to major disruption, so VISA has to show their customers that they can innovate too and play the blockchain game. This car leasing showcase is what their marketing department/partners came up with.
I guarantee they had a discussion whether the showcase should use bitcoin/blockchain tech for carrying out the actual payment, but management said no.

Each company, bank or financial institution have their own private ledger. Hence heavy on clearing and settlement.
I would have to disagree that HyperLedger is broken by design. There are a lot of applications in trading or internet of things where parties would benefit from both PoW-chains, PBFT-chains and distributed ledgers.
There are tons of reddit posts explaining why private blockchains don't make any sense/are doomed to fail. Each and every one of them fail to explain the following:
A public, open blockchain is a means of digitising truth, or trust if you will; a participant doesn't have to trust other participants, but is still able to trust information on the blockchain as long as more than fifty percent of participants are honest (for PBFT this number is 33%).
Why couldn't a private blockchain provide the same benefit? Banks don't trust each other today, and typically require escrows and collaterals for extraday transactions. A private blockchain would enable banks to trust each other as long as they trust that at least 50% of the banking sector is honest.
As for trading, banks trade via exchanges (unless they can match orders internally). They utilise partner networks to trade on foreign markets and they also have dedicated payment networks to settle trades (TARGET2, CHIPS, ...)
