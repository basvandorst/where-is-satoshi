Here, a fantastic explanation on how Ethereum was made, by hodlmax; the 'Thing':
@_date: 2019-07-23 15:11:11
The  last generation of altcoins are mainly 'premine' tricks. This is a just  a way to generate an asymmetry between the people controlling the code,  and the people looking for something shiny, with wonderful buzzwords.  This is from an economic perspective 'easy money', and can't compete  with Bitcoin at all. This is like comparing Gold with Rocks.
On the long run these 'altcoins' are just replaced by new one, with new shiny buzzwords, and often by the same people.
The only question is: Is a team of crooks can do a better Bitcoin? The answer is of course no. But newcomers are ready to pay, and they will get the same result again and again.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:32:01
FIATs are doomed anyway...
@_date: 2019-07-25 10:05:32
You must look at the economic side. 'Hard Money' is the reason of the greatness of Bitcoin. Bitcoin alone can compete against Gold and FIAT. 
Here is the definition of a shitcoin by Saifedean Ammous himself:


@_date: 2019-07-01 14:39:04
Bitcoin is 'hard money' enforced by a fully decentralized network. 'Alts' are centralized companies, selling buzzwords. Why would you HODL an 'easy money' token? This is worthless.

Dash was an 'instamine' operation at the beginning. As this first con artist trick was not enough for their get rich scheme. They invented the 'masternodes'. A way to get interests on the money they printed for free.
Dash is definitively controlled by pure crooks. Looking at the price action this sh\*tcoin is going to be forgotten soon.

We can't fully understand Bitcoin without this book. Great work!

Ethereum as a fully centralized system, is already equivalent to a classical database with a few spares. Ethereum 2.0, if it succeeds, will be equivalent to an Oracle Database, with the SQL replaced with the funniest language available for web pages: javascript. Ethereum is a two-pillar approach: marketing and stupidity!

There is no 'All'. Jimmy Song explains everything properly; Bitcoin is a new asset, with new properties. Because Bitcoin is genuinely decentralized. 'Altcoins' are not decentralized, 'Altcoins' are like modern Arts. The value came from marketing, and marketing only.

If the maturity happened, a lot of people, will find out the hard way, that when you are outside the Bitcoin world, blockchain and database are synonym, and can't be anything else. Before Bitcoin happened, nobody cared about private money managed by a database under a central authority. If you know about SQL databases, they are already better than Ethereum 2.0. Altcoins are pure marketing on one side, and based on conceptual misunderstanding on the other side.
@_date: 2019-11-07 13:26:54
Without the Gold Standard, Gold as money makes little sense. I agree with you, most people can't understand Bitcoin, and a lot of people can't even see any difference between Bitcoin and sh\*tcoins. Bitcoin as the ultimate hard monetary asset, free of any kind of attack, will ultimately prevail. But this process will take years.
Bitmain was the main mining manufacturer for a while, but this is not the case anymore. The mining is quite well distributed, everywhere we can have cheap electricity: Asia (outside China too), USA (Washington state...), Russia, South America...
@_date: 2019-11-07 16:03:54
I'm quite certain that mining operation were affected by the 2017 China Bitcoin ban. Mining Operations are companies privately owned, and operating for their own interests, and not for the CCP. Some of them moved outside China.
China mining Operations are definitively not a threat anymore.
Gold ownership was made illegal in the USA, and was confiscated. Bitcoin was designed to handle this kind of attacks. Forbidding something you can't enforce will be seen as a desperate move.

You can 'fork' Bitcoin the software, to get something incompatible at the protocol level. But, you can't 'fork' the philosophy. The philosophy is mainly driven by the 'don't trust but verify' mindset. Without the philosophy, the incompatible 'fork' is just equivalent to a classical database under a central authority.

We must remember, that we deal here, with open source software, if a technology was a genuine improvement, and was developed on an Alt, it can be imported back to Bitcoin. This never happened, and will never happen. Because Alts are stupid games, and their only value is driven by marketing, and, poor understanding of the technology implemented in Bitcoin.

Alts target newbies. And if they failed to anticipate, they find out that there is something wrong with the product they bought. 'The Better Bitcoin' narrative failed again, and again...
Here is an answer, the definition of a shitcoin by Saifedean Ammous:


Shitcoins fork the Bitcoin code, and break the protocol compatibility. To remove everything ensuring and enforcing the properties of  Bitcoin we like. The Bitcoin community and, our full nodes, are removed from their equation. What gives Bitcoin its greatness, is discarded, and replaced by a *premined,* and a team of crooks in charge. The genuine decentralization is destroyed. And shitcoiners will never try, and use the software, so who cares, this is useless anyway. The shitcoins are money printing machine for their owner, nothing else!
@_date: 2019-10-25 13:17:21
Bitcoin vs Alts
For instance, Ethereum: Ethereum is just a premined Altcoin where the native language of Bitcoin was replaced by javascript, and the blocksize limit was removed. This operation is a deconstruction of the Bitcoin incentives. When you are using, a database containing low value data, for instance javascript states, this increases, at the end, the cost of running a full validating node beyond standard computer hardware. But you may also consider that the software development is fully controlled by a few people, and nobody can audit a specific version and runs this specific version too. The software itself leads to full centralization. At this end, the whole software system is just centralized database with very few replica, owned by a single company. The endgame is already achieved by Libra, and doing this can't get you anywhere else.

A summary of the situation:
* Bitcoin is an ultra hard monetary asset. Money is a winner take all situation.
* Everything else are companies promoting their *easy money*.
The definition of a shitcoin by Saifedean Ammous:
A shitcoin is anything promoted as a form of money whose supply is easy to increase. In other words, anything other than gold or bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-19 10:28:14
*Maximalism* is a term promoted by scammers. We must pay a tribute to the most famous of them: Vitalik. He is the first one to invent this term, to promote his premined scamcoin.
Money is *a winner take all game*. The hardest money available has an economic advantage over anything else. Bitcoin competes with Gold and Fiat. And Bitcoin is the 10x improvement over Gold. Bitcoin is the *hardest money* available to humankind, and Bitcoin lower the cost of *Authentication* to nothing. Bitcoin is just the best money available; Bitcoin is genuinely *trustlessness* without any central Authority. The hardest monetary policy is enforced by our full nodes, and *the don't trust verify* mindset.
Everything else forking the code of Bitcoin without being compatible with the protocol (or just the Modus operandi), are just shitcoins. Their main goal is to print money for free for their owners. They all have a central authority, nobody runs the software, and the monetary policy is utterly elastic, following the interests of the crooks in control.

This video/title is a reminder that a lot of people have no idea how the technology operates.
* Bitcoin covers the vacant niche left by the end of the Gold Standard. Bitcoin, the ultimate state resistant ultra-hard monetary asset technology, has the right incentives to succeed, where Gold failed. Bitcoin will prove itself, year after year. This will take time. Ten years from now, Bitcoin will be stronger.
* Ethereum covers a different niche. A product with the wrong incentives. A lot of software rely on a database, and you want to use the database at zero cost. But you remember a technology that was at $0 the first day, and $20000 later. How to benefit from the magic? You merge at the software level both products. In a way, both are using, some kind of database. Is this making sense? No, of course, but who's care! We already have a market for flat earther! A market for magic software should exist! This design aged badly. But Ethereum 2.0 will fix everything! If logic can be fixed, it will!

Ethereum is the perfect pyramid of stupid/scammy ideas: Launched with a massively premined token; Zero value companies sold through their system. Now DeFi as centralized as Ethereum itself (fully centralized). With PoS the perfect way to get interest on the token printed for free (They are following DASH people here)...
