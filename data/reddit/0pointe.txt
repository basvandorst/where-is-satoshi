The nice thing is: it can't do that without invading your privacy even more and signing its own death warrant.  I'm down with either.

Add Celtic Ireland to your list of research.  It was very near an anarchist society and resisted conquest by the time's superpowers for many hundreds of years.
The take home is, you're far more willing to defend your family, friends, and neighbors than a faceless mass.

So stop using Apple for anything.. like any person with any sense did long ago.  They're just a bunch of assholes

Than what?  Windows?  Yeah probably.  I use various Linux distributions.  A developer who denies that superiority is no developer, probably just a designer.  Osx is just an attempt to make another flavor that's expensive and opinionated

That will actually be the password though.  So many bad memories never go away. The settlement didn't go his way.  He lost his little boy Fluffy that horrible day.  It was the worst day of his life and that will always live on in his memories.  He'll never forget that precious little sweater.

I was just watching this, and they certainly seemed to be admitting that bitcoin is here to stay, and just trying to get a grasp on what the future will hold and how they could possibly regulate it.  I don't think it could really be regulated on the P2P level, but they will certainly try.  At this point they just seem to say "well the giant immortal lion is out of the bag.... uh... now what?"

Do they not realize that the emergence of an uncontrolled global currency HAS NEVER HAPPENED?  This is totally uncharted territory, of course there is going to be massive uncertainty and volatility.  Seriously, you don't have to know much about anything to know that the unknown breeds chaos.

That wasn't happening yet.  Purchased my a bitcoin on the 15th, there was no checkbox about the future value shit at that point.  Got my full first bitcoin today, $480 price tag.  I only saw that checkbox show up over that weekend with all the craziness
