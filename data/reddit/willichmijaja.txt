I run it now with a cronjob similiar to this. I tried the hole day to make it somewhat robust but without any noticeable success
@_date: 2014-09-24 17:18:34
Just try it every 5 min. I restart frequently

I withdrawed 1k € last week it took only 5 hours. No problems here.

Is there a chart where I can filter transactions with a certain among of value e.g. only transactions with more than 1 BTC involved?

A long way to go till Bitcoin is ready for the amount of micro-transactions from just the few examples. But when we get there...

Thanks for this information. I have friends who send money to Brazil on a regulary basis. They would love to save on fees by using Bitcoin.  But I have no idea if its easily possible to get BRL without using localbitcoins which is to complicated for a 75 year old grandma

I really like the Idea, but without smart contracts it lacks transparency. Maybe there will be a trustless implementation soon

I made an account recently and passed the first verification level. But on the deposit page I see no entry to deposit my € only BTC and other Cryptocurrencies are showing up. There is nothing in the FAQs about the needs of a higher verification level or something like this
