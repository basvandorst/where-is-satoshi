In fact they will gain customers, just like MtGox did after February 2014!

The problem is that 99% of people in crypto today literally do not.
They didn't forget pirateat40 either.  They simply weren't around.

Ding ding ding!  Congratulations sir, you are the winner.
You cannot hope to undersand the Tether situation if you're one of these "I don't see what's wrong with AMLKYC" people.

There aren't that many shorts, mostly because the exchanges and brokers are imposing extremely high margin requirements (40%-60%).  If you want to short BTCFutures you will have to tie up a whole lot of cash in order to do so, and most investors don't like doing this.
This is actually one of those extremely rare instances where the banks did the right thing.  Letting people short *anything* with margins like 5% or below is silly.

and yet an expert on them?  wtf

Maybe it was.
Court filings take a few days to get posted online.
Besides, we don't hear from Visa's lawyers, coinbase does.  We only hear from Visa's PR department and if they're as lazy as the rest of the company you better believe they don't work weekends.

Read youself some Mark Twain, friend.
Politicians have always been scumbags, and intelligent people have always known this.  I bet you think your generation invented sex, too.

Right, obviously we need a world government to protect us from shitty governments.

Yes but in *whose* shit must they transact?
