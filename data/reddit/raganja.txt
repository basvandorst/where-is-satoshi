Your funny. Been in for 3 years and going no where. And it’s called not putting all your eggs in one basket. Do some research on those other coins and see which ones you think will be viable. Keep your head in the dirt but the next years to come will be focused on Blockchain and you will be left in the dust.

Are you kidding me haha of course it won’t, it might but with their scaling issues it’s highly unlikely. But a majority of my investment is in other coins so I’m not worried �� salty you got in the game in 2018 and got immediate losses?
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:35:11
You’re weren’t smart enough to ever cash in, just keep missing the boat

Great in theory; but imagine fiat was banned and crypto was national currency for the us. We would all be majorly ducked. Especially for anyone over the age of 35 who doesn’t give a shit

The concept is like Marxism, it’s amazing only in theory. But people are too dumb and busy to do all of their own finances. As Americans, we will never be decentralized. We will always need to call and ask for help, or have the Indians online do stuff for us.

You guys are emotionally attached to this stock. Just sell and get back in if it looks good......
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:41:38
This will definitely ding during our lives. There’s no point, just look at the year chart of any coin. All I’m saying is why even take the ding. Just in the small hopes that it will moon
