Ok I've pasted to both those links you gave so hopefully that will help?

Ok I will wait it out, heading to bed and will see later on if it's went through. All I'm needing is it to confirm within 24 hours, don't want to be waiting days for it or even not get my money back at all. If it hasn't confirmed later, would my idea of sending a smaller transaction which would have a higher fee and seeing if a miner will accept both?

What time frame would I be looking at? I've sent quite a few times from virwox with around this amount and never had issues, I'm not sure why this has happened, so frustrating

If it doesn't will I get my money back? I'm going through a hard time right now and short on cash, this is a lot for me and it would be really bad to lose it.

Just seen, it's got 1 confirmation, brilliant! Thanks for the help, think those two links you gave helped.

I'm a newcomer so I've literally not got a clue! I take it it's high enough? If so what other reason does it remain unconfirmed for hours? Not had this issue before.

I sent from virwox so it never gave me a choice to set the fees or I would have set it high. Anything I can do about this? What if I sent another small transaction which would have a higher fee, would a miner accept both?
