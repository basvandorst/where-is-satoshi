"it is known stolen credit cards are used."

Yeah and you don't even ask why. He's so 'passionate' about a site he doesn't use and never has. I wonder why. Howcome you don't? Maybe... he had the idea and they beat him to it? Because it's something like that. EVERY site has fraud but he goes into wild accusations about the company somehow aiding it. Which of course he doesn't say as they aren't.

"You guys actively encourage fraudsters " hahaha we know what you use your coins to buy, sniff, sniff.
It's a good site. Unfortunately there are people like you in this world :)
"Good luck when the the "conspiracy to commit fraud" or similar cases start heading your way."
It's a new year, you should look into rehab.

That's sad... that your life is so small that you remember that and are so petty that you had to jump in and post that. I hope the wait was worth it.
