Your concern is that this powerful miner has found a way to mint blocks with few transactions. The thing is that miners are free to pick and choose what transactions they want to include in a block, and at that point it is a probabilities game weather they manage to mint the block before someone else does. Bottom line is, some pool operator is trolling the blockchain, which they are free to do.
is suggesting that if block rewards get reduced to be insignificant next to the fees, then the miner might be incentivized by greed to include more transactions. That is not going to happen short term, but it sure as hell will happen naturally long term (if bitcoin doesn't crash and burn first) thanks to the reward getting halved every 4 years. 
Trolls will still be trolls. It's a fact of life on the internet. Don't get your panties in a bunch over it, and don't just dismiss analysis of the problem and proposed solutions just because they don't throw the baby out with the bath water

Miners are used to getting 25 btc + fees. When the block reward gets cut in half, they'll be making 12.5 btc + fees. Since revenue will be cut in half, they'll use the only knob they can to try to restore even some revenue. Either that or they'll just quit mining. Look what happened to doge.

The miner picks the first one it sees and includes it in the block it is working on. If the miner finds the block before anyone else, the transaction it saw first is the one that gets onto the blockchain and wins. This invalidates the conflicting transaction(s) and they are discarded.
In addition, historically a node will only relay the first transaction it sees to miners. If it sees a conflicting transaction, it is dropped. The proposed change will allow the nodes to propagate the conflicting transactions to make it easier to raise a double-spend attempt alert with the merchant.

miners are the aristocracy - as a collective, they control the votes and control the blockchain. Short-medium term, they will do everything that they can to get as much revenue as possible out of the blocks. At the moment, the vast block reward far outweighs any revenue that is generated by fees (25 btc per block reward vs 0.1 btc in fees). 
I agree, long term the fees will ideally be enough to pay for the hardware, the electricity, the hosting and the staff that maintains the facilities, and with the rising conversion rate, the fees will pay for all of the above all alone. Long long term, the block reward will be irrelevant, and at that point, the fees along will have to carry the entire mining community. It is still a bitter pill to swallow that has now had 2 big example events:
* Bitcoin's block reward got cut in half from 50 btc to 25 btc, and the conversion rate shot, making up the difference.
* Doge's block reward got halved (forgive me, i don't know what the doge block reward is) and the conversion rate plummeted, and then a bunch of miners quit.
Long term, the conversion rate will be irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:45:28
I think we're probably at about 30-40% right now. Still got a ways to go. I do see (some) miners increasing the minimum accepted fee for priority as block rewards go down. Therefore, I predict that each time the block reward halves, the global average fees will go up.

Flash cells start out with all 0s and can trivially flip them to 1s when needed. Flipping them back to 0 requires erasing the entire cell, and that is an expensive operation involving *quantum mechanics* that does put wear on the cell. SSDs will instead rewrite the contents (modified by flipping the 1s back to 0 where needed) in another cell and keep track of "stale" cells for erasing and recycling when idle.

From a security standpoint, an address should ideally only ever have 0 or 1 spends, but any number of receives up to that first spend. The public key is only revealed on spend, and that is when the addresses security is slightly weakened in theory. (In practice, you need a quantum computer to derive the private key from the public key. At that point there are *many* security systems all across the world that are vulnerable, making bitcoin security the least of *your* worries).
From a privacy/tracking perspective, each spend leaves a trail on the address that could potentially lead to compromising the identity of the owner of the address. However, following the trail of change has the same problem.
In reality, the protocol allows one address to make as many spends as it pleases.

Folks, I'm very happy to see alternate bitcoin protocol implementations. This is something the network really needs for health and contingency plans. I admire the fact that this is so well documented with security in mind. However, I have a problem with this requiring java in the first place. I think the concern about security as this post makes it sound with signed code and everything is putting the cart before the horse. Relying on java as the foundation was a bad choice, as the mere presence of java on a system (especially one handling wallets) multiplies its potential attack surface. For security sake, I will not install java on any system that touches bitcoin wallets, which means that this alternate bitcoin implementation, along with everything that builds on it is off limits, and that makes me sad.

The official download is signed by the original developer, and then with your own appleid account. You can't just install it on another phone without signing into your own appleid.
You have 2 options to distribute an app outside of the app store:
* Spend $99 to get a developer license and then build [the source]( signed with your developer license, and the UDID for up to 100 devices.
* Jailbreak each device you want to install it on and run either a build from source, or an ipa from the app store without checking signatures. 
Jailbreaking bypasses *ALL* signature checks for every app so you could very well be getting a malicious version of the wallet as mentioned by Worse, jailbreak apps may not honor sandboxing, so you may install some unrelated jailbreak app/tweak that can seek and slurp any wallet on the phone. Bottom line is that mixing jailbreaks with bitcoin wallets is a bad idea.
On the other hand, giving apple $99 for a developer account is just rewarding bad behavior. Your best bet is to instead spend $50 on a cheap-o android tablet, and run anything wallet related there. Just be aware that same caution about malicious software still applies on the android ecosystem.

Question: will I have to rebuild armory for my pi, or will the old one still sign transactions built by the new version? [Building it for the raspberry pi was a pain in the ass](
Edit: this build may still be unstable on Mav. It finished building the database and scanning the transaction history, then froze up. Just relaunched and it's re-scanning the transaction history again. It's good to see that Armory is still being developed though!
Edit 2: After letting it re-scan the transaction history again, Armory opened [this application modal window]( and blocked until I clicked OK. My guess is that the first time around that window got lost in the window stack on some other space. I checked the checkbox so it won't happen again.

It isn't like we're anywhere close to hitting capacity at 1M yet. I assume that *most* miners are likely using the default limit of 350K. I rarely see blocks larger than 500K whenever I look, and they're usually significantly smaller. The 1M hard limit is there because bitcoin is still beta, and we don't want things to get out of hand too quickly.

no. The difficulty would adjust within 2100 blocks. If we're running 1 block every 10 minutes, that comes out to 2 weeks. If we're running 1 block every 20 minutes, that comes out to 4 weeks. There are also caps on how far the difficulty can adjust. I believe that they are 30%. so if 50% of the hash rate gets turned off, you're looking at even longer before the block rate evens out to the 10 minutes per block goal.

I think that this approach would work very well with both the terminal and wallet having a camera and a screen. A transaction would work as follows:
1. your wallet displays QR code containing enough wallet information to generate a transaction
2. terminal scans QR code and validates that you have enough btc on record to meet the bill and builds an unsigned btc transaction
3. your wallet scans the QR code and asks you as the user if you agree to the transaction
4. you click OK and wallet displays QR code of signed transaction
5. terminal scans QR code and broadcasts the transaction on the bitcoin network
This reduces the wallet to a device that is some storage, a screen, a camera and either make it a touch screen or add enough buttons to run the transactions. Such a device would then be able to be programed with whatever btc addresses you want, or generate new addresses on the fly.

 says, "The 8-character code you see on the outside of the coin is the first eight characters of the Bitcoin address assigned specifically to that coin.  You can verify the coin's balance on [Block Explorer]( Use that code to verify the coin has a bitcoin balance.
They also say "The "private key" is on a card embedded inside the coin and is protected by a tamper-evident hologram.  The hologram leaves behind a honeycomb pattern if it is peeled. If the hologram is intact, the bitcoin is good."
The bad news is that there was a discussion in the spring or summer about someone getting through the holographic seal without breaking it, allowing them to obtain the private key and sweeping the coin in the future. There is no way to tell if this is the case until it is too late. If you are paranoid, or intend to spend the (currently almost) $1000 value in bitcoin, you should break the seal yourself and sweep the bitcoin into a wallet, otherwise, leave the seal in place and you've got yourself a nice nest egg.

Yes, I already have my pi running with an offline wallet using a version of the source that I built in March. My concern is really the make unsigned transaction in v 0.89.99.10-beta, signing it with whatever build is already on my pi, and then broadcasting it with v 0.89.99.10-beta part.
Thanks for the tip!

* "credit" transactions are still authorized by the signature (sometimes not even that for phone and internet transactions).
* "debit" transactions are authorized by a pin. I don't know the technical details of how the pin is handled (weather it is directly encoded on the magstrip, or encrypted on the card, with the pin as a simple key, or something is broadcast on the network)
* yes, we have imprint transactions, but I can't remember the last time I saw one in use.

I make it a point to never use paypal, so I don't know for sure, but i'm pretty sure there is. I have seen both square and intuit advertise credit card reader dongles that plug into the headphone port, and apple uses an off the shelf case with a credit card reader in it in their stores.
after a quick search of the app store, I found:
* [paypal]( appears to let you move fiat between paypal accounts.
* [paypal here]( reads and charges credit cards with the paypal dongle.
* [square register]( reads and charges credit cards with the square dongle. 
* [square wallet]( appears to be an alternate way of sending payments to square register.
* [intuit gopayment]( reads and charges credit cards with the intuit dongle.
I highly doubt any of the above give apple a 30% cut.

Check out [this calculator]( to see that mining bitcoin is a losing game. If you are in it to learn and have a fun hobby, go for it. If you are in it to make money, you'd get better returns simply buying the bitcoin.
I'm running a pair of 60 ghash/second ASIC rigs that *will not* pay for themselves. In a few months, they won't even pay for the power they're drawing. Bitcoin mining is an arms race. My ASIC rigs are like bringing a handgun to a thermo-nuclear war. If you want to mine on a CPU or GPU, thats like bringing a knife to that war.

I don't see how rewarding valuable posts with valuable bitcoins spams the blockchain, especially when people are just gambling on sdice.
If you want to complain that it's spamming reddit, you might have a point there, but it's certainly not spamming the block chain. I could in theory directly do a btc transaction if I had the address of every person I might tip, and it would generate exactly the same amount of blockchain noise as using the bot, but the bot takes care of all that for me. The bot serves 2 purposes: a) make it simpler to tip value for value and b) help spread the word that btc is a thing and people are using it to move around real world value.
On the other hand, sdice is just moving btc back and forth (for all intense and purposes) and doesn't generate any value except for the sdice investors.
As for the fees, I happily pay all my btc fees. I have been a miner in the past, and I may eventually be a miner again in the future.

I built a copy of [Armory]( for my [raspberry pi]( From there I made an offline wallet and exported the neutered offline wallet that doesn't contain the private keys for use on my desktop. 
At this point you should use Bitcoin-QT to transfer your balance to the cold storage address. You could simply import the keys into the offline wallet before exporting the watch only wallet, but than you run the risk of your keys leaking.
To spend the coins in cold storage, you have to build the unsigned transaction on the online wallet (to confirm you still have the btc). Copy this unsigned transaction to USB storage. Mount the storage on the offline computer (my raspberry pi in my example) and sign the transaction. Then you can bring the now signed transaction back to the online computer and broadcast it on the bitcoin network. 
Having your private keys airgapped from the internet makes them extra secure from online attacks, but you should still use precaution with physical access. In my case, the SD card is locked in my bank's safe deposit box until I want to spend the btc. This cold storage wallet is obviously for long term saving. I keep a small amount of btc in blockchain.info for spending, and I am an idiot for not backing up that wallet, but since I have most of my btc in cold storage, it's not as painful as it could be!

Do the math. If the reward halves every 21000 blocks, the total number of satoshis will hit 2,099,999,997,690,000 (20,999,999.9796 bitcoins) before the block reward becomes an unspendable fraction of a satoshi.
Also, note that [this graph]( never touches 21M.
Edit: It took more searching than I thought it would, but [here is a table of block reward schedule]( You can see that by the 16th era (block 3150000 in the year 2068), the reward becomes marginal anyway. Hell, I'm mining a block *right now* with more fees than the reward in the 9th era!
