Maybe 1M BTC is their reserve bid.

Not really. It's an arbitrary number, and it is infinitely divisible. There will always be room to have a slice of its total value.

There seems to be a lot of crossover between drug enthusiasts, rebellious anti-authoritarian teenagers, and Bitcoin.

Oh, get over yourself. And if you think people involved with Bitcoin should be held to some higher standard of intelligence, tell that to all the slavering greedsters who lost everything on the last bubble by investing with mortgages, life savings, etc. Bitcoin doesn't select for intelligence more readily than any other get-rich-quick scheme....

Create your own Internet and maybe that will be true. Until then, don't underestimate the level of omniscience they have while you're playing in their backyard.

Not that I believe this, but I find that interesting in the context of what the Bible has to say about the mark of the beast:
Rev. 16-17: "And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, and he provides that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his name."
Like you were saying, what if there came a point where you had to buy into this system, along with all of its (potential) perils, or else starve?

Reality and rational thought == "killjoy". I think we've discovered the driving force behind Bitcoin, everyone!

But people *are* generally stopped by laws. There are many who skirt them or ignore them entirely, but most don't. And if you're talking about Bitcoin, which will need mainstream acceptance in order to see its potential, heavy regulation or even an outright ban might make it very difficult to continue as anything but an underground novelty.
In any case, I wouldn't doubt for a moment that if the government doesn't try to crush it, they *will* at least go for a piece of it (ie: taxes), and people don't often succeed at screwing with the IRS.

Remember: Absent any *major* developments, if the price goes exponential, it's a bubble.

Is there any reason his site couldn't take advantage of Mt Gox' trading API to calculate shipping cost in BTC on the fly?
It'd be as simple as: (cost to ship)/(price per BTC) = (shipping cost in BTC)
...hardly rocket surgery to script.

At the top of the last major one several months ago, I was. Of course, there was no way to know for certain if/when it would crash, and people will do as they please anyway.

Wow... So You have $300k in BTC and burn it on a gambling site? Aren't there better ways to invest that sort of cash?

But at what cost? Modern agriculture is hugely dependent on oil, not only for cultivation/harvest and distribution, but for synthetic fertilizer as well (the massive runoff of which is killing aquacultures). While it is arguable that we can produce enough food to feed everyone, the process is burning through limited natural resources and polluting the environment. It is possible that this is not sustainable... in which case, the previous poster's point still stands.
