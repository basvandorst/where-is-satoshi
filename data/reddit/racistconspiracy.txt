This is the same old scammer.
@_date: 2013-06-21 02:39:16
Oh no, I'm sure you're running a legit business.

Most investors are not interested in highly volatile speculation and most interested in economics are not interested in any kind of internet-based gold standard, and insofar as they are, they're just interested in proof that it is superior to the USD in some regard. There are at least two applications for which BTC is superior to USD.

No, the spam comment I was replying to. The mods took care of it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:51:10
I see what you're getting at. It'd be a Keynesian bitcoin. You might take manual control of the difficulty level to make shifts in the inflation rate.
@_date: 2013-04-24 01:39:25
I am surprised it took them this long.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:45:47
Bitcoin is more than that.
@_date: 2013-02-20 18:43:41
I'm pretty tired of people capitalizing the 'c'.
@_date: 2013-04-20 06:30:19
I must be late.

It's probably

GPUs cost more to run than you get in BTC already. ASICs are just making it worse.
@_date: 2013-01-13 17:40:47
Yeah, I think the growth is real this time, instead of being a speculative bubble, as in last time around. 
But we should still keep our eyes open for irrationally exuberant speculation. People are bullish on Bitcoin for the time being.
@_date: 2013-03-26 01:54:45
Yeah, but the massive deflation since then makes up for it a bit.
@_date: 2013-01-29 15:11:31
Yeah, and you can check blockchain.info to make sure you got it.
@_date: 2013-01-21 00:01:33
Anyone selling Bitcoin for a third less than market value is running a scam.
@_date: 2013-01-19 21:14:49
They also come with stickers.
@_date: 2013-02-23 19:10:59
It's probably a power-law distribution like USDs are.
@_date: 2013-06-20 04:39:28
Scammers gonna scam.
@_date: 2013-01-29 15:01:47
If it defined Bitcoin, blockchain, and double-spending at the end, this'd be an excellent ELI5 explanation of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:27:01
In the short term? Things will be volatile. Big swings are possible.
In the long term? Everything will be fine.
@_date: 2013-06-20 04:29:05
And there's always more where that came from.
@_date: 2013-06-21 00:02:54
Not you, the one I was responding to. Notice the deleted post I'm replying to?
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:54:04
@_date: 2013-02-20 18:45:54
It's too bad it had to load the blockchain. It's not a huge deal to me.
@_date: 2013-06-20 03:58:48
The above user is a scammer.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:54:38
The bubble and its burst are entirely human errors.

Silk Road is one of the killer apps for Bitcoin. The other is gambling. I thought people here were all about governments not being in control of currencies. Is it any surprise that activities the government does not approve of are the first to use Bitcoin? Does anybody really think Bitcoin is going to take over without expanding beyond Bitcoin enthusiasts?
Every other currency works the same way. More people read about how to start a lemonade stand (or whatever) than read about how dollars are printed. If Bitcoin is going be anything but a novel fad, there has to be  purpose for which it is better than the existing alternatives, and those purposes have been discovered.

Learn to use apostrophes.

It did it. It just took a day.

Whether or not you can install a second card depends on whether you have a slot for this purpose on your motherboard. 
At this point, it's not a good idea to invest in GPU mining. You'll likely pay more for electricity than you'll get in coins, and this will only get worse as more ASICs come online.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:44:42
Bitcoin is currently down 40% from yesterday.
Sure, it could bounce back, but it hasn't yet.
@_date: 2013-06-20 04:09:51
This user is a scammer.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:17:29
These were good people, too, trying to pay everyone back after they lost everything. Oh well.
@_date: 2013-01-22 15:09:53
"REDDITOR" is the code.
@_date: 2013-02-21 06:33:17
It's looking like a random glitch.
@_date: 2013-06-20 03:56:48
This guy above is a scammer.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:46:48
Oh yeah? I hope it holds out for a while.

They don't carry stickers for the world's most popular Unix distribution. ;P

This changes nothing about anonymity.

I was once playing with my transaction fees to get rid of an odd amount of miniscule change and I accidentally sent a transaction with no fee. It took like a day and a half to go through. Bigger transactions without fees or with miniscule fees can languish for quite a while.

I hang out a lot over in and related forums, and the general consensus is that this article is utter nonsense.
There's no evidence at all, and $5000 is a laughably small amount to take SR hostage for. DPR lost that much money in minutes. B5000 I could begin to see, but again, evidence?
There are tons of rumors, but nothing substantial at the moment as to why this is happening. There is little reason to believe any rumor at present.
@_date: 2013-04-30 23:52:24
So far it hasn't had a significant effect, if any at all. I don't anticipate much of anything, either.

If one entity controls the value of the currency and holds half of it, it is centralized. What you're proposing would be even more centralized than the currencies BTC competes against. 
@_date: 2013-01-17 06:34:38
Yeah, it's all going to come down to how much of this is speculation and how much is commerce. Last time around, it was mostly speculation. This time there's a much bigger economy, but that by no means does that rule out a speculative bubble.
@_date: 2013-01-28 13:14:17
Hooray! They're now as good as that other famous site which uses BTC.
@_date: 2013-02-04 03:04:53
It's going to happen to slowly to have a big effect on Bitcoin. If the whole US did it tomorrow, it would cause a big move, but beyond that, it doesn't really matter.
