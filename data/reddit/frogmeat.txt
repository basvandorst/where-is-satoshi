Calculate the debt service payments relative to income for yourself.

Apparently you aren't.  And not great with logic, either.
Nobody will borrow in a currency that is continually deflating, because the cost of the debt would skyrocket even at 0% interest.  Wages would decline as the currency increased in value -- see, that's what deflation means, currency increasing in buying power over time, hence a decline in wages and in prices of goods and services -- while debt payments would remain the same.  **Debt payments would increase steadily relative to income.**
Therefore, the only way to entice borrowers would be to have a negative interest rate.
The inverse is why a fixed-payment USD-based mortgage, coupled with typical inflation, results over time in a **declining** real value of the mortgage payment.

So you anticipate negative interest rates to account for deflation?
You do realize that means lenders paying people to borrow their money, right?

Um, you can't "beat the value increase".
Your income would be **declining** as the real value of the currency increased.  Here's an example:
You borrow 100,000 units, owing 5,000 units per year for 20 years at a whopping 0% interest.  Your income is presently 50,000 units per year.
The currency deflates by 50% over the first 10 years.
Your income ten years from now is 25,000 units per year.  (What, you think your employer is going to keep paying you 50,000 units?  No, your pay gets cut.)
Your debt payment?  It's still 5,000 units per year.
So, instead of paying 10% of your income for debt service, you're now paying 20%.
Get it?
Nobody will borrow in a deflating currency.  Except maybe you.
Now, let's say you borrow 100,000 units, 20 years, 0% interest in an inflating currency.  Debt payment is 5,000 units.  Income 50,000 units.  10% of your income goes to debt service.
Currency inflates by 50% over 10 years.
Ten years hence, your income is 75,000 units.  (No, not 100,000.  That'd be a 100% increase.)  Your debt payment is still 5,000 units.  You are now paying 6.667% of your income for debt service, down from 10%.
Borrowing in an inflationary currency is sensible.

Which means a NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE is necessary to entice borrowing in a deflating economy.  At a 0% interest rate, with a deflating currency, your debt payment **increases** as a percent of your income and in real value over the life of the loan.
Negative interest rate is necessary.  I'm sorry you're unable to comprehend this.

Um, no.  You're not good at math, are you?
You are simply not comprehending that your debt payment will INCREASE relative to your income.  Your income will DECREASE over time, and your debt payment will REMAIN THE SAME.
Your employer, paying you 50,000 units in 2011, will see that 2% annual deflation means your 50,000 units are worth 51,000 units in 2012 (in constant 2011 units).
Your employer will then CUT YOUR PAY.
Your creditor will not CUT YOUR DEBT PAYMENT.

You said that inflation is considered when determining the interest rate, and ditto for deflation with bitcoin.  
Interest rates increase with inflation.  That means, by necessity, negative interest rates when you have a continually-deflating currency.
