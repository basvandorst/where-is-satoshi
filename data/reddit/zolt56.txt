I'm verified on coinbase, but to get verified on GDAX or increase limits on coinbase you have to give them more information so they can find you in 'public records'. If you're not in their system for whatever reason, which is common if you're in college, you're basically screwed.

I want to transfer my bitcoin from Coinbase to Poloniex but can't get verified on GDAX because they can't find me in public records. What should I do, do I just have to eat the fees? I can't think of any other options at this point.

I switched tabs to this thread when it started dropping under 10k, switched back, and was almost disappointed to see it back up to 10.2k even though I want it to go up. This is weirdly kind of true, as if watching people shit themselves is almost worth the losses.

People in the first world don't do that anymore, more than 60 years ago perhaps it was possible but not today.

Putting at least a small portion of it in silver/gold is just good financial security in case of catastrophe or SHTF. Never put all your eggs in one basket, as the old saying goes.

I want to get verified on GDAX so I can transfer my btc out of coinbase, but trying to set up my account it says they can't find me on public record. I haven't even reached verification yet. Is there any known fix for this?

Well I never specified the cash part, that part is up to the individual, but some of what you don't leave in crypto should definitely go into silver/gold because it's the best form of financial security in case of a major catastrophe or SHTF, even if it's just a fraction of your total wealth. Again, how much is up to each person.

What about Bitsquare?
Everyone always talks about bitcoin and anonymity... is everyone here really sending all this sensitive personal information before they exchange? It just seems odd.

"People with radically different morals, values, beliefs and sub-cultures is a good thing"
*autistic screeching*
Edit: 99.9% of the entire historical human population lived in homogeneous communities, it's literally in our DNA. That's why the demographics of NYC for example, often dubbed the "most diverse city in the world", largely consists of ethnocentric neighborhoods where people of the same ethnic background, language and culture live together.

Do I seriously need to send sensitive personal documents to exchanges over the internet in order to buy/sell bitcoin? There is no other way around it?

If anyone were to ever end up with 10 million, the best thing you can do is to pull most of it out of crypto, stash some in gold and silver for extra security, and just life as normally as possible. Be quiet about it, be comfortable but be frugal so it lasts you a lifetime.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong; if someone were to invest in a small cryptocoin that rose from $0.40 to $0.60, would they not make the same return on investment as someone who invested the same amount in bitcoin from $4,000 to $6,000?
I'm new to all this and interested in bitcoin, but wonder if short-term ROI might not be better elsewhere (I already know where my long-term hodl is going).

We don't know for sure if it's true or not, but regardless it's kind of sad how many people look down on Russia as an "oppressive authoritarian regime" while pretending that kind of corruption doesn't exist in the West, including plenty of suspicion of our own political assassinations. The only difference between theirs and ours is that one is promoted to the public while the other is shamed and condemned as "wrongthink".

Gold and bitcoin have very different strengths and weaknesses, so it's kind of hard to say whether one is "better" than the other. Bitcoin is essentially high risk high reward, you can get rich off of it but if it crashes or something catastrophic happens to the electrical or communications grid, you're screwed. Whereas gold and silver are good investments for financial security and will always have value, but aren't necessarily ultra-profitable.

No, the new tax plan lowers taxes for 80% of American taxpayers according to the left-leaning TPC, and only those making hundreds of thousands or more may be getting increases if they live in a high-tax state. Also according to the TPC report, the middle class is receiving a larger percentage of the tax cut than what they contribute to the total tax revenue, meaning this tax bill disproportionately helps the working and middle classes, and the rich are now paying a larger share of all federal taxes than before.


He promised to finish off ISIS first, and has refocused military involvement in the region from fighting the government to defeating ISIS, after which hopefully he does pull out. The missile strikes were unfortunate but widely viewed as a strategic message to North Korea and China (who's president was with Trump at the time) much more than Assad.


In addition to zoning in on ISIS, he also put a stop to the CIA's covert operation to arm the child-beheading FSA terrorist group, often referred to as the "Syrian rebels", which resulted in a river of tears from the corporate neo-liberal media and hysterical declarations that this was proof he was "Putin's puppet".


The plan was always to use a border adjustment tax and the like to charge them for the wall. Also, DACA would cost 26 billion over 10 years, and illegal immigrants currently cost us 50-100+ billion per year. Even if we did pay for it we would be saving money in the long run.


Trump is usually working even when away from the White House. For example, hosting Xi Jinping while "vacationing" at Mar-a-Lago, meeting with lawmakers over a round of golf, and continuing his usual schedule of meetings and calls.
Etcetera, etcetera.
