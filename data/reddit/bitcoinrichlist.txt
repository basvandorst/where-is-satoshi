What do they say again about biting the hand that feeds you?
Without Bitcoin Core and all the people who have worked very hard for it over the years, Coinbase would not even exist. Show some gratitude!

For those who don't know what P2SH means:
P2SH stands for pay-to-script-hash. These addresses start with a '3' instead of the usual '1'.
Multisig is an example of such a use case

Still pretty dark in the second and third world.

Nice build! Thanks for your detailed work, this is a good resource for anyone considering building a full node

Thank you! Those will show up accurately again in the next few days when everything has been updated.
I like the visualization idea you provided, I will think about how to best implement it!

Check out [BitcoinRichList](
I guess I could add a calculator with a visualisation to show your position on the list. Currently it displays the top 20000 adresses, so if you have more than 74 BTC you could check manually. 
It is currently a bit out of date, but my node is catching up as we speak. The block parser was displaying p2sh addresses incorrectly which has now been fixed, so the site will be accurate again soon.
