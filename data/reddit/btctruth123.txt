I could be bsing and this is all made up. I’m going to find out how I can profit from this and then I prob won’t post any proof or I dunno. Here’s the deal so people recognize WHAT really happened.
Few years ago a bunch of Asian whales got together and started advertising and pumping LTC hard. As news got bigger they started MASS buying LTC at 1,2,3 and then people started getting excited and everyone started buying. At around $8 boom crashed down to $2 in 1 night.
Certain big YouTube names involved in selling investment advice and self improvement etc - all got together and came up with a deliberate plan to push bitcoin through mass advertising through taking and teaching and etc - there was a giant push on all social media for 3 months.
It was all planned out 16-20k they all sold everything they made that they bought waaaaaay before while suckers listened and got excited and FEAR OF MISSING OUT got them to buy massive.
You guys don’t get it these people understand psychology so well... they know how to manipulate you fools that thinks getting rich quick or having a Lamborghini and shit is life...
Lol while the real Kong’s rich or poor live happy by having their essentials met and surrounding themselves with good people and KNOwLEdGE
My adivice? I don’t care I’m going to blackmail them and get money or expose them 100% - they did nothing illegally wrong since it’s not stock but there is clear evidence of the plan and how to execute and whose idea it was originally and so on.
