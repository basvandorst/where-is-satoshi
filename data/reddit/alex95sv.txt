Thanks! And actually helped me with the exchange! 
So I guess I can use this dollar to tip nice people on reddit :)

Ha, I didn't know that. I've had only one problem so far, and it was that one of the servers (Romania) doesn't show up that its located there. And I have one website that allows only a couple of countries (RO is one of them) and I can't access it. Other than that, the speeds are good for me, and it's not constantly disconnecting me, so it's not *that bad* (for now).

As I mentioned, I'm a rookie, I don't even know how you do that. Also, I figured there'll be a legit way to buy bitcoins with normal money...

I did sign up for Coinbase, but I'm not from the US, so the bank option is not going to work :(

Thanks again! :)

Where can I see if there is one available near me(Berlin)? And can't I do it online...somehow...?

Why is it so hard for people to get bitcoins??? 
And the fee was around 10€, I mean, I wanted only 7, and to end up paying 17 + other fees... no, thanks.

Well, I wish there was some website with some sort of reputation/vouches so that people can see if a person is a scammer or not... just dreaming out loud :)

Thanks! It's actually pretty close to my work, so I might try tomorrow!
 
Thanks again!
