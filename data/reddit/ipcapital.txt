We just have to take advantage of this (or them).
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:06:14
Yes is they scale. Each transactions (moving coins) have to be added to a block, a block can only contain a certain amount of data. So you have to wait a miner (or group of miner) to mine a block and you pay a fee so they add your transaction to the block. More transactions + more mining difficulty = higher fee and waiting time.

not necessarily. gene corn expert may not be a math expert (all these bots trading using algorithms) and may not be human behavior expert (irrational market). Example: the 1999-2000 tech bubbles: the experts and shorters were right calling the bubble but most lost it all anyway. Even the news called it a bubble all over the place 4 years before the pop. Yet they lost cause the market stayed irrational for too long. :: you think there is so much money in crypto but that would be a mistake. You can analyse all you want and be right yet a new bitcoin billionaire can completely manipulate the market by himself and play against the trend. The market is still too small.

Over 50MW the price for datacenter is 2.8c/kwh here in Quebec. Smaller operation are paying around 0.9c/kwh (price in US dollar). 
To be fair, Hydro Quebec have been pumping this news for over 2 years every few months yet nothing is happening: minimum investment is huge + get construction permit + city permit + datacenter construction + fiber + get all the hardware from China... who wants to spend 50M$+ and have to wait 2 years before starting to mine?!

Fud? When is the last time you traded on Bitfinex? It is taking more an more time for them to initiate withdrawals. They are playing with money waiting for fresh deposits to get enough cash flow. There is still no proof they have any money backing Tether.

If miners dump all or stop all sales then what is left if just basic trading of current supply. A collapse of big change in mining have an influence on long term. Short term is driven by basic trading.

Bitmain (mining operation) mines BCH to support the network. If they quit and switch back to BTC obviously it is the end of BCH. In that case we will see a huge spike in BTC mining difficulty and reduction of mining profitability short term. It should push BTC to the next bull run but in between it could be chaos
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:23:08
I don't see Bitmain as a healthy player in the crypto world so the fact that they are holding 1M BCH that they can't really sell now (the market can't support it) is nice  (my opinion) because it could kill once and for all BCH. What I am worried of is if (big IF) they are able to pump back BCH one last time, sell (make a huge cash or BTC stash) and use this to basically double their hashing power again.
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:32:47
True, but when they are making profits they build more hardware for themself. Miners they can switch BTC &lt;--&gt; BCH. If they go back in the green I suspect they will stop pushing BCH this time, re-invest in their in-house mining operation and set all their miners to BTC. Making them even more powerful. I'm not sure having Bitmain around on the long term, as a player that concentrate hashing power, is a good thing. But again who knows. Anything can happens. Maybe they don't even need BCH to come back if crazy investors jump into their IPO.
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:45:42
Don't underestimate Chinese company to come back. On top of moving their "not so great" hashing power from BCH to BTC they can grow their hashing capacity really quick with cash flow. They bought a facility (where I live) for a new 300MW operation this summer (for a single location this is huge, all while being "broke"). That is just one of their current investments worldwide (investments I don't see in their IPO doc I found, they seems to move a lot of assets out of China at the moment).

Supply comes from miners. Demand from everybody. If demand drive the price so is the supply.

300mw (one single facility) gives you around 2700PH/s where I live (operation, cooling.. all included). How many they have in total? Noone knows. They are building multiple new facilities here and in Europe. It seems no one is able to identify all mining operation  controlled by Bitmain. Bitmain had a lot of meeting with our local government and power utility company for this deal. They asked for over 500mw just to start.. they were given 300mw. Bitmain plays the card they are doubling (just what they tell) their hashing power this year. I have doubt with their current situation but they are still spending and investing so the money has to come from somewhere. For now at least where I live they are still smaller than our local miners.

that is why the risk is still limited for now. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:14:04
Yes we do mine at a lost if we have to and cash flow / risk management is part of this . Here we have to play scenarios before a big trade or mining investment (talking millions or hundred of millions). Like what happen if there is a full switch of mining power overnight? Does the coin holding change in value? Maybe not. Does the mining facility loses in value due to reduction of production? Maybe yes. At the end it's all interlinked as the money is from the same group of people.

not on short term but it does force the price up. If cost of mining goes over selling price for too long (over 3 months) there can only be 2 conclusions: 1: reduction of mining (smaller network, less transactions, bad press, fud and price falling) or 2: miners force higher rates (transaction fees or higher selling price) and the marker follows. This is not done overnight. Mining does not represent the total coins pricing/value but it does have a big % of it. That is the only reason BTC did not fall to the $3K range yet : simply because big miners did not dump their coins yet. Just to make this clear; I'm talking about the real bug mining operation. In my area we installed over $300M worth of BTC miners over the last 12 months only.

OP did not mine for long or with a big operation. This is not how mining economic works on large scale (and large scale operations represent the vast majority of mining power).  Big miners sell coins one or twice a year to cover base cost at market peaks having the opposite effect: selling less bitcoins each time when the market is higher than the last sell off (higher value per coin = less coin needed). They operate the exact same way as real gold mine. They also try to sell at peak what is required for them to grow (by equipment) but it is limited as the biggest expense are the Asics and they pay them in Bitcoins (and Bitmain keep all they can). Then once every 2 years on an extreme market peak (like when it reached 20k) big miners cash in part of their portfolio. This causes rarity and market price control over long term (short term price is driven by trading).  
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:05:29
One more thing: 12M a day in new supply is nothing compared to market volume. We already can absorb many time that if miners were to sell it all every day. That is what will drive the price up. We just don't create enough bitcoins per day to supply bigger traders/investors/institutions.
