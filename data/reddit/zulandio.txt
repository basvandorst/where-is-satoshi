I alos notice they were saying AUR withdrawals/deposits were taking longer then usual. I did do some business with them because well the were the only ones to have Maza Coin. Anyways they charged me .01 AUR to withdrawal my coins. Then didn't even pay a transaction fee to send them getting them stuck in the block chain for 3 hours. They also charge .0008 for BTC withdrawals and only pay .0001 transfer fee. The people running this site are shady at best. Be warned about this site.

Be careful with BTC-E peoples money has been in limbo there for weeks on end. Some claim to have been robbed... I'd stick with Stamp over BTC-E even the Trollbox on BTC-E says they don't try and buy BTC there.

I followed some of them back them back to a wallet that eventually sends 500k coins to GOX. By means of half a dozen wallets. This wallet 
Leads back to this wallet
 
Follow the 250k and they shrink until here  
Follow the 500 k at which point they lead here 
No doubt these coins are related to Gox and the fact that they are danced all over is a sure sign of an insider hiding something Smoking gun?

Yes what does it mean hmm your giving away 100 BTC for a xylophone, bongos, and a clarinet? Cause I just happen to have all three here.
@_date: 2014-03-07 08:58:27
Just moving the coins now.

If you ask me that's already what is happening. I'm a noob and tried to ride their coat tales but just kept losing. Never listen to the troll box is easier said then done. :\

And this is why we need crypto. Never would of been an issue for your bank account. One less thing to worry about.

This activity is SOLID evidence of an inside job. I found some of these coins come from a wallet that sends coins to GOX why would a hacker put these aside and then lead a trail of coins back to GOx for 500k?

So you get to dictate what I can and cannot find offensive? I know what you mean and it's not any less condescending no matter what context you were using it. Something along the lines of "If your ready to step up and do some serious trading then.. " But your post is condescending in nature no matter how you look at it.

It's nefarious but the same nefarious activity occurs with coins leading to GOX why would the person that stole these coins send coins BACK to Gox? This is evidence of insider theft what dumb ass he didn't hid his trail good enough. See my comment above.

Actually he's talking about increasing trade fees to 1.5%. So essentially anyone that would continue to trade on the site will be paying for the reimbursement not to mention lost of profit from trading with that 12 % this is a joke. Like I said cryptsy is looking pretty nice lately..

I might agree with you but I noticed this wallet only shows 100k being deposited 50k of which come from the 180k on the move. This wallet then having only received 100k sends 600k out.  In this transaction which says the coins came from the same wallet they are being sent from.  Someone seems to have successfully masked the origin of the 500k coins or somehow edit the block which is supposed to be impossible right? These 500k then show up eventually at Gox 
@_date: 2014-03-07 09:08:54
Well looky looky  UGH I hate being a noob can't post but once every 10 mins!
@_date: 2014-03-07 10:57:03
See my post it links these coins to a wallet that sends 500k coins to GOx The wallet is 300k Hacker has acess to 300k wallet only takes 50 and sets them aside for a rainy day. Then moves rest of coins to GOX? WTF ever! Inside job 
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:27:48
I"m starting Zulandio Coins send BTC here and when I get done developing them I'll send you some they are going to be HUGE! 
YOu can trust me I wouldn' lie.

This was my first exchange. I don't' have money to use I spent 4.5k on mining equipment that I have to get a return on. And don't have the funds to be a "big boy" how condescending was that.

They didn't smudge the vehicles license plate making finding the person and house easy as pie.

Looks like these could be the 2011 Gox hiest? I found another wallet with 500k in it sitting since 2011.. Never know the 740 k may of been missing for a long time working on fractional reservesr? 
Edit followed these forward and they lead to Gox. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 11:32:28
So someone tired very hard to hide this TX  But failed to do so. They did however successfully mask where the 500k came from.... :/ in this wallet 
more digging will have to be done by people who know such things to find out. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 09:33:58
I followed some of the bigger transactions back and started moving forward and found this  These coins are indeed related to gox.

It bleeds fiat out of BTC what do you think they do with the profits they make there is only so much you need to pull off this scheme. It's taking BTC from the people and centralizing it with a select few. I thought BTC was supposed to get the money system back in our hands not put it into others hands. 
@_date: 2019-06-10 14:02:52
I just read an article saying they have known about this for 2 months. Therefore they have been warning everyone for 2 months that this is coming. So if anyone loses their coins over this it will be their own fault for not keeping track of their assets.
