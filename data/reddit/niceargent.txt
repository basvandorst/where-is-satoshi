Great summary! 500 bits @_date: 2014-10-28 21:16:14
We aren't done. The current symbol of awful!
@_date: 2014-10-07 20:13:07
Here, have another goldstar! @_date: 2014-08-07 06:06:51
How do we know the private key isn't being sent anywhere?
@_date: 2014-10-16 14:00:14
Oh yes, you can mine. That'll be just a total waste of energy and resources.

A growth that fast is not sustainable. It is actually the definition of a bubble, people will buy just to have gains, and when many sell, it will pop.
Bitcoin will have more bubbles but the average price will keep getting bigger over the years.

Well, I hope they use some of that money to make a decent app.
@_date: 2014-10-07 20:15:07
Thanks for your perspective. I've come to think that the way one learns *any* language as native and as secondary, is very different!
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:41:44
As a non native english speaker, I can't understand why so many of you keep making those mistakes!

In my case, I was using Coinbase as a web wallet and I didn't have any bank account linked. They read LocalBitcoins on one transaction's comment and now they want me to complain with FINCEN. Goodbye, Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-08-08 00:07:52
Great! And how do we proceed when the wallet is password protected?
@_date: 2014-10-28 20:35:26
Great approach. 100 bits for you! @_date: 2014-10-03 14:41:33
Great explanation. Here's 500 bits! @_date: 2014-08-08 19:28:38
Argentina will be the next Bitcoin hub!
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:40:09
Exclusive, unless one or more poeple have your private key.
@_date: 2014-09-25 20:13:06
Can you send me 100 Bits to Argentina? :D
@_date: 2014-10-28 21:14:37
Yes, and it's time to update it. Did not anyone check this out?
I like this one even better:
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:56:07
I haven't really thought about that. I guess we do the same in Spanish. Sometimes my american friends ask me about a certain rule and I'm like, I don't know but *this* sounds right.
@_date: 2015-05-05 03:56:11
Wait, are you talking about @_date: 2015-05-06 19:10:33
Argentina Bitcoin subreddit: @_date: 2015-01-27 01:44:02
Oh, Argentina. If only Bitcoin could put you out of this political misery...
@_date: 2015-01-27 03:40:52
1 gold star
@_date: 2015-07-28 13:24:59
I would say so. You could also defy inflation by buying dollars but for us (that we know Bitcoin) it's easier and safer to buy bitcoins online instead of going into a shady place to get bills.
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:12:08
I'm kinda tired of these titles. As said, most Argentinians don't know what the hell Bitcoin is. A small percentage knows a little about it but has no idea how to use it. A tiny percentage actually uses or used it. That's not more than ~5000 people in a country with 40 millon people.

I've recently installed Copay on my Android. It's a great wallet, but what stops other applications from reading copay data and stealing the private keys, if not encrypted?
@_date: 2015-07-21 22:44:31
I understand, but for the sole purpose of trading, they make and excellent option, you don't need to trust anyone holding the dollars...
@_date: 2015-07-21 14:37:05
Why doesn't it use nubits instead of okpay?
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:02:25
Thanks! 750 bits. What about the JS versions for Windows, Linux and Mac?
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:33:24
You're right. Using many dollar providers wouldn't hurt.
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:24:44
I'm pretty sure Brazil is the strongest economy in south america.
@_date: 2015-02-06 03:10:45
Thank you :)
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:35:23
That did it. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:07:19
Nailed It.
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:20:54
Keep up the good work! 25 ARS.
Also, why is a '?' next to my balance? My funds are all confirmed and I am not using SPV.
