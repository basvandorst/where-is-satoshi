ZERO CAPITAL GAINS LEGALLY
Ok so you become a resident for tax purposes of a zero capital gains tax jurisdiction, Google it and realize you gain there problem solved....
See how bitcoin is going to arbitrage inefficient legislation/policy like nothing else before it.
I do.
IRS is US specifc, nothing to stop you sending bitcoins to other jurisdictions.
US &lt; WORLD
BITCOIN = WORLD

this happened to me with Lite coin on osx. I don't know how they did it...iI susepct I installed some software and it had a keylogger in it. 
They seemed to be waiting for me to reenter my password
It was almost directly after I spent some LTC for the first time in months that the hack was done.
They re-crypted my wallet on my machine with a new password
I thus nuked the computer and put a new os on it.
There is some sort of OSX BTC/LTC virus/kelooger out there. O think it looks for wallet files and does several things.

this is a good point, he is not there on merit of his argument but by his access to implement state sanctioned violence.

i tried 3 days back in 2011 to buy BTC, 3 days solid (was not in the USA) and nowhere would take my credit cards etc into any US payment or system that would let me buy BTC.
I found out years latet I could have purchased linden $ and then btc....
but who would have guessed.....

how clean and modular is the segwit codebase?
@_date: 2019-12-04 11:47:52
nah I think the gov can print a loooot longer now  
gold is basically outlawed, or not usable
individual tracking is computerised
society is fragmented all to buys chasing $$$$ just to break even.  
Printing money is fee especially when you are the reserve currency, usd.  
Humans can easily handle a dicksonian spread of wealth which is where is is going and more.
@_date: 2019-12-04 11:07:15
yes easily.  
probably 250K I just wish I had enough $ to buy 1 .... if only I purchased some back in 2011 or 2013 even at the high.

1) because hardly anyone private individual takes physical delivery of gold as a % of Gold reserves. So its all faked by certificates that are fractional reserve.
The vaults are empty the gold is long gone
2) you can  not sent gold through the internet 
3) you can not carry gold in your mind.
4) you can't take gold across a border
and that's just a start.

when you go on the train and know that everyone you see all day, in their tens of thousand go by, not one likely has a BTC let alone 10 or more.
You realize they will all work for you, as you crush their buying power.
You have a vacuum cleaner in their wallets24 hours a day, always on, sucking the value out, and they have no way to stop you, except securing their wealth it BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:52:26
Maybe, I suspect the blockhain would be forked in about a day to a secure version, eg like QRL or something, so everyone would get their balances back
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:03:23
wow changed position much
