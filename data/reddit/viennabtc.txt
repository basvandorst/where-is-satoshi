A British pound will buy you one slice of old bread.

Sounds like you FOMOed right at the absolute all-time-high?
I guess, every sane person (that also knows Bitcoin for a longer time period) would've told you not to buy at these level.
I hope, those 5k weren't any emergency money, or like it's told here in every thread "don't invest more than you can afford to lose".
Me and a Friend bought for the first time in the end of 2013, at around 650US$ per 1 BTC, just to see Mt.Gox collapse, rest is history. It was hard to watch it fall to below 200US$, but we never sold for a loss. I think you should give it at least 1 or 2 years. Remember: there is so much evolution ongoing right now, and the next halvening will come for sure.

Maybe I understood it wrong, but how can "half of your life savings" be **gone** as of today, if you got your hands on BTC at prices below $1000 or even $500 or anytime pre 2016?
Not to offend you, but weak hands very much? Gambled with money you couldn't afford to lose, so you had to re-exchange to fiat to cover daily expenses?
I still don't get, how else one (since 2013) could've lost "half of his life savings" instead of having at least a few hundred % gains, since then.
What am I missing?
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:42:55
I don't get it. How is that even possible, if you've been around since 2013?
The only somewhat explanation to that, might be if you always bought on the top and sold at the bottom, every time?
Like, how could it be, that half of your savings are gone, if BTC went up to prices we have since 2016 or 2017?

Quick &amp; Easy?
If you know him good enough, maybe live nearby and you meet him often enough,
he could just install a Wallet on his mobile and you guarantee to buy/exchange the BTC for the price the customers paid. 
So, if a customer paid a 20$ haircut with BTC, the barber doesn't have the risk of volatility or the hassle and costs of exchanging, as he gets the 20$ in cash from you in exchange for the BTC.
I do that with a small shop from a friend of mine, as he likes to accept BTC as a payment option, but is not interested in hodling or having additional work or fees.

So you aren't in the situation or confident enough to buy the BTC from him, at the rate he got them. Thats okay. It was just an idea, enabling him to accept BTC free of risk (with you converting his 20$ worth of BTC into 20 Dollars) and saving a lot of $ in CC fees.
You wouldn't guarantee the (future) value of BTC, but that his BTC revenue would be exchanged to US$ without a loss, risk, work etc.
Like I said, I do that with a friend of mine (also because I look at this as an cheap and easy way to buy/get more BTC) and a while ago he told me, he wants to convert/exchange only about 50% of his BTC revenue, because he saw the value increase, did some more research on the topic and wants to manage it on his own soon.
EDIT: also, I'm not a fan of using or involving Coinbase at all (for various reasons you can read all over r/bitcoin)
@_date: 2018-10-17 00:59:23
Thats nothing compared to the obviously paid or managed discriminating accounts at the biggest german mainstream newsoutlets with "open" but moderated forums (like derstandard.at for Austria, or heise.de) with a massive amount of readers.
It is just fun to keep track of those few accounts of commentators, spreading the same bullshit over and over, that everyone with a working brain can refute.
But it is still a fight, to don't let such (paid?) Idiots influence the common reader with obviously false informations (remember Roubini and his 50 Dollars cost per transaction?)
If you're able to read and write in German, i'd like to ask you to help out at derstandard.at , where it seems to be a massive (redactionally allowed!) campaign to discredit, criminalize and denuncsicating every single pro-Bitcoiner.

There are dozens of ways to aquire BTC, where you don't have to deal with limitations of any kind.
You might be interested to read up on some examples like "Mycelium Local Trader", localbitcoins.com ,  "jobs for BTC" , look for Bitcoin-meet-ups in your area

I see this Blockstream yadayada more and more, but I'm not sure why.
1 or 2 years ago was the last time some people came up with that kind of argument, while it was like a handfull (5%?) of developers (that contributed to Github/Bitcoin and most of that did not find its way into the actual code) were somehow related to Blockstream.
Did I miss something?

One has to decide for himself. Depending on the area you are around, and how convenient it is to get to another ATM with lower markups, if you're in a hurry and so on... but I'd refuse to pay more than 5-6% (without ID).
Because there are still a dozen other options at even lower rates to get BTC, like in person (Mycelium and the "Local Trader" feature, for example)... or at a Meetup etc.
@_date: 2019-02-26 12:23:27
Sure, but how many people are actually affected by this special circumstance? And even if someone was forced to do such a move, it would have only been temporary, until you arrived at their new destination.
And to me, such a temporarily situation (or workaround) doesn't refer to have "skin in the game", as in using those lifetime savings, funds (retirements, mortgages) or even borrowed money, to invest.
That is just nothing a sane mind should do, in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-02-25 10:55:13
Privacy as in buying with cash, small amounts (several times) without the need to ID.
Most ATMs I know, don't need any ID or registration for amounts below 250 to 500 € over here.
But you have to look closely on the exchange rates, sometimes this 'extra anonymity' comes at a hefty markup (everything over 6% is a ripoff imho).

I'd also say, the bolt placed on the bitcoin logo is a "well enough" addition and combines/transports the message very good.
If I were making such a sticker, I'd make the bolt a little more "bolder", with a frame, or relief or something like that. Just a litte bit more 'outstanding' or more 'prominent'.
Also would add the sign "&amp;", because you have the choice of paying onchain or per Lightning.

They shouldn't even have this kind of skin in this "game" and really reconsider what happens, if the (unlikely but not impossible) 'Black Swan' occurs, or some other shit hits the fan.
But it seems to be the same as with ppl still keeping their coins on exchanges or elsewhere not under their own full control... but some have (sadly) to learn it the hard way, over and over again, I guess.
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:05:36
Not so clever, but only made possible through his accomplice Jihan Wu (Bitmain), who already had a lot of mining power back in the days.
It's hard to identify which is a legit tx and which is 'intentionally malicious', but you can estimate the costs by multiplying the median or avg tx fees of that time, with the numbers of tx's necessary to produce clogg up for wasting space in the blocks - I'd guess.
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:33:13
or any other coin, too :P

@_date: 2019-02-25 11:34:15
TL;DR: there is a chance such an attack can occur, but it only works under very special, very costly and unlikely circumstances.
The congestion (plus spamming) happened almost the same time as the last big bull run and so it added up to the situation we had in the end of 2017.
Today we know the purpose of that spamming was some kind of a try of 'marketing' for an already failed sh*tcoin, that wanted to improve their flawed and failed argument, that bigger blocks are a necessity.
One more reason this kind of attack 'worked' somehow, was because this special malicious actor had a good chance, that the fees he spent on tx's would come eventually back to him by mining/finding enough blocks that have this tx's included (which lowered the cost of such an attack for him).
If you compare tx counts from then to now, you'll see that the network is now doing almost as much as tx's as at the time of the 'big bullrun'.
BUT, the fees are only a fraction of what they were back then, because a lot of scaling mechanisms are already in effect (and there is more in the pipeline).
So, on one side, in the past year a lot already happened to minimize the possible impacts of such an attack.
A malicious actor without enough mining power established (like a bank, you suggested), would have significant higher costs to perform such an attack.
Especially, if they want to do that on a longer timeframe.
On the other side, immutability is a feature, not a bug.
No one can stop you or anyone else to do as much transactions as you want (or can afford), each time paying the fees to the miners that are happily collecting those fees.

I know what you want to say.
But you can't deny the point, that the results of a stress test may have value, too. For example to absolutely refute the (very popular, but wrong) non-argument that Bitcoin never could handle enough tx/s on a worldwide scale. That is a huge point in many discussions (mostly with nocoiners).
To take your analogy, we already are testing the engine every day. But know we should test how much power it really has under racing conditions.
To me, there is nothing wrong with "showing off" its (probably) impressive results, as every car and engine is compared on its power.

I'd really like to know where you get these numbers from!
European/Austrian here, so I could tell you a few things about the last 3-4 years of inflation, overall prices (especially living, energy and groceries) at stagnant wages for most of the people.
 I wrote about 3 weeks ago:
Vienna: winner of Mercers Study "most liveable City" in the world... again, for years.
This numbers compare 2014 to 2018 (as today).
Ham 200g (not the good one) 1,69 / 2,09 €
Milk 1L (not Bio) 0,85 /1,29 €
Emmentaler Cheese 200g 1,69 / 2,29 €
Onions 500g 1,29 / 1,79 €
Coca Cola 1,5L 1,49 / 1,95
Buying a Flat 2015 was 50% more expensive than 2010 (same m²)
Renting a (used/old) Flat 2010, was 27% cheaper as it was 2015.
From 2015 to 2017, the same 70m² standard-flat had a increase from
average 371€ to 539€ ... thats 45%.
As I mentioned before, at stagnant wages (some even below the real inflation rate) for most of the people.

And dumb people actually believe it and commenting like "this cryptoshit is ruining our enviroment and killing bees, thats not a currency yadayada..."
if you're fluent in german language, you should visit  , actively leading the witchhunt on everything related to cryptocurrencies, censoring explaining comments while they promote utter bullshit-comments to "you should read this" section.

I was writing for years about de Vries and his blatant lies in german forums, demasking it to what it is... just blatant lies.
And all that stupid mainstream media is still just picking up his numbers to generate clickbait and stupid comparisons, framing the utterly dumb "oh no, earth is gonna melt because bitcoin" idiots are cheering,..well, we know for sure there are paid shills to astroturf/frame this position to the general public.
If you're german, join forums at derstandard.at for example, austrians biggest german forum, with at least 5-10 Trolls (still not 100% sure if ran by the newspaper itself, or outsourced writers to discredit everything and everyone involved with crypto... but I'm working on getting better informations and documents to prove that)
need to be debunked. Weekly discrimination of every Bitcoiner, tainted as criminals, scammers and whatever (you know, darknet et al)... in so called newspapers has to end.

Would'nt even poke that website with a stick.
But did they have a custodial wallet, or something?
If so, I somehow smell an exitscam incoming soonish.
Would be wise (as always) to get your BTC out of everything that is somehow related to that bunch and back under your own control.

I already gave you a sentence: "especially as there is/will be always an incentive for someone."
A 2nd sentence could be: "there is something called transaction-fees, too."
But as I also said before, it depends on a lot of things, which aren't easily put in a few lines.
Especially to someone that maybe haven't done any former research of how and why this thing works at all.
So, the advice for anyone who wants this question answered in detail stays the same.
Read this: Saifedean Ammous "The Bitcoin Standard"
and maybe also Andreas Antonopoulus "Mastering Bitcoin", as both are widely viewed as the standard lecture on this topic.
I hope "do your own research" is still a thing?

As the Boulevard Media spouts and pukes out all the Energy consumption-comparisments based on that scammer named "de Vries" and his bullshitnumbers...
wouldn't it be a better measurement to achieve and document something like 3 times more transactions as Visa in a day?
Because everyone and his (nocoiner-)donkey still comparing that shit?
I know, that you can't count LN tx like on-chain...
But just to debunk those faketroll-LN_is-Vaporware Idiots.. we need some statistics. Or?
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:10:32
I'm totally with you and Saifedean, but also with Andreas.
But there will be 2 or 3 others. Don't forget, with LN we get atomic Swaps, too.
Bitcoin is and will be "the go to" thing and Blockchain, if you want or need to use a Blockchain as it's meant to be. For the obvious reasons. After years of reading, researching and so on, there doesn't seem to be any realistic, viable alternative - and that is okay to me.

@_date: 2018-02-28 14:06:35
Yes, you're right. Sudden moment of rage because to ever hear about this guy again led me to an unreflected posting.
But I think we can agree, that "if" CSW were Satoshi the MSM would freak out with that information, the price would tank like 90% or more and all those nocoiners yelling "told ya so, bitcoin was always a big pyramide scam from scammers yadayada!"
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:32:11
Thank you very much!
So even if you add 30% for things like cooling, aircondition, switches and stuff, and also another 20% after that for "older hardware" (like around 28 TW/h), Digiconomist is still far off in his predicton/actual measurement (51 TW/h), as it seems.
Now one more thing is bothering me.
0.098 J/GH (or 98 J/TH) for the Antminer S9.
Either it's too late, or I'm already "blind by numbers".
But how exactly is that even calculated?
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:21:04
TIL: they really publish their self-owned hashrate.
But they seem to claim it is only 2339 Petahash/s (not even close to 17 Exahash/s) on 9. October.
This can't be true.
And I don't think and can't believe that all the remaining or missing Hashrate comes out of the other hardware they sell/rent for cloudmining or whatever you want to call it.
Quite fishy, if you ask me.

@_date: 2018-11-18 11:26:07
Is there a way to identify or verify, how much of Jihans/Rogers total available Hashrate was pointed from BTC to ABC?
10% 30% 50%?
Because people often talk about how many of the total BTC hashrate is centralised under Jihans direct control (you know, like "those China miners control 70% of everything" blablah).
I mean, if Bitmain redirects like 50% of their hashrate from BTC to ABC, and BTC hashrate only drops by 5-7% at all, they can't have more than aprrox.  10 Exahash in total, or am I missing something here?

Individual goods? We're talking about everybodys daily needs.
For some Cities this might be accurate, but for Vienna it is mainly immigration issues why cheaper (normal) flats increased that much.
And corruption too, i'd say, as the biggest "landlord" (the city/government and their close friends) here was pro-immigration and open borders, but only slowly starting to build new affordable housing.
QE is well in the mix of overall, too much soft money around, printing to cover debts, nearly nothing of QE went into the pockets of the normal/working people.

Not sure what you are going to say.
The Article is from march 2017 and the S5 seems to be just an example, as far as I understand.
A few lines below it used:


and his estimations


which was the correct Hashrate of that time,
are seemingly to involve a mix of different Mining-Hardware, which leads to the 3 different calculations:
Energy consumption (TWh/yr)
* Lower Bound: 14.19
* Best Guess: 18.40
* Upper Bound: 27.47
while, on that date, the digiconomist was already stating/claiming something over 40 TWh/yr
So, you could say (is that a proof?), that Digiconomist's numbers are at least 50% off of the (realistical) best guess, regarding the annual consumption?

For me, bitcoins (or satoshis), are also a permission to write on the most secure and immutable Blockchain available.
Assuming ongoing development and potential usecases (besides "money") for countless services in need of immutable and incorruptible data/proofs.
So that is one point, why i keep holding some, spend some sometimes, but also restock.
Because I'm pretty sure that we'll see more and more "use" of bitcoins as a "needed ressource", to make an entry in the Blockchain.

@_date: 2018-02-20 22:47:45
Here in Austria, there seems to be a massive (paid?) effort to tell people in the comments of MSM articles, that LN doesn't even exists and thus, no transaction ever happened.
Thats why I looked for something like "transacted Value" or the number of succesful LN transactions.

Currently, yes, as Cryptos or Bitcoin in special are still in
an growing and volatile state.
This means, if you already have BTC since a long time, its unlikely you made a loss at this time,
except you bought the freaking "fear of missing out" frenzy in December.
So if you bought 1 BTC somewhere in the past, below $1000
it isn't that much of a problem, if this 1 BTC allows you to get healthcare (or any other thing) worth $7000 right now.
Bitcoin accepting stores, mostly, see and do this, to offer
an alternate way of payments, just like they do with various
cards or other means of systems at this time.
In that sense, they often don't keep and hold the BTC
but sell them right at the time/worth of the bill you paid for.
It is possible to instantly sell them, to mitigate the risk of volatility.
This allows to "set" the price as usual, in your example $200,
to make sure to get and convert back to this $200.
Of course, some merchants do keep their whole BTC-income,
but those are totally aware of potential downsides (and upsides!).
But I don't see anyone to "set" prices in BTC in an "analog" way (like a Menu card)
in the next years.
But if you view this as is/should be the currency for the Internet,
"fixed" rates on a stonewall (Brick&amp;Mortar) aren't the main thing to consider,
as onlinestores and Apps don't write their prices on a wall,
but can display and convert the actual price of the product in $ and
show the equivalent price in BTC, in Real-Time.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:51:44


No Shop, no Bar, no Restaurant, no Cafe,...
that accepts bitcoins, would - and has - never ever let you wait for confirmations! As long as isn't a few thousands € or $, you - and the receiver - are totally fine with seeing the Transaction "on the way" (your Wallet/POS stating you're receiving a "cash-like" payment in the next couple of minutes) . That is good enough, for everyday payments.
If you sell a House or a Lambo, yes... have a seat with the buyer, invite the buyer for a cold one, make sure the transaction has at least 3-6 confirmations, enjoy that hour of conversation, do a test ride, show them the nice perks of their new house...
C'mon... i've paid with bitcoins at at least 50 locations all over Europe. NO ONE ever said "oh err, please wait 10 minutes before you leave", as the receiving Wallet shows in big bold green letters "yeah, transaction on the way, you will receive the demanded 0,00xx btc".

@_date: 2018-04-20 08:53:54
Why? He asked me to give him an "as short as possible" start, no more or less. How would you try to get someones head around this quite complex thing, from the start, and as short as possible?
While I like the other "Magic Internet Money" explanation, I don't think it qualifies for a short overview of what is happening here :)
@_date: 2018-04-18 10:14:07
Which risk? BitPay (which should be avoided), just takes the risk of volatility and does the service of exchange to fiat.
If you mean the risk of a "double spend" or something, I don't know.
My point was, even for a few 100$ as a (Brick&amp;Mortar) Merchant, it is totally fine from the moment your wallet shows "tx is coming".
As an Onlinestore where you might order something, it is even less a problem, because it makes no difference if they start processing  your 700$ order 10 or 30 minutes later (1-3 Confirmations).
If you order a Pizza (15$) they will start immediately, but still have the chance to cancel the delivery, or give you a call, if something went wrong, which is highly unlikely.
Once again, no one that accepts bitcoin as an additional sort of payment in his Brick &amp; Mortar Store, will ever let you wait for confirmations, as the chance or probablility of a (successful) fraud attempt are tending against zero.
Fee prediction should be done by the wallet, yes, some of them could need a better estimate. But most wallets I know, give you a choice how much fee you want to add. And I never and nowhere had any problem with setting the fee to "low / economy", as all of the accepting Merchants knew and saw "my Wallet says a legit tx is on its way and its extremly unlikely it won't arrive".
I agree that it is already instant and actually trustless,
as soon as you "grasp" that it is near impossible a legit tx woudln't arrive or the customer could successfully "game" it.
In perspective and by this argument let me ask you this: do Merchants let their Customers wait for 4-6 Weeks, until the payment with a Creditcard is unrevokable and received?
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:29:33
Let me know what you think about that:
A 25-something years old asked me, to explain Bitcoin to him as short as possible.
I: You know Gold, right?
H: yes.
I: You remember downloading from decentralized Torrents, many peer-to-peer connections to get your File together and how fucked the whole global Content-Industry was, because there was no way to stop it?
H: Yes
I: well, now Torrents and Gold had something like Gangbang with some Genius and some Cryptography joining in, and the result was a wonderful thing, called Bitcoin.
H: and? what does that mean?
I: So, we're on par, that Torrents were unstoppable, and Industry adapted.
Gold is some fun stuff. But doesn't fit in your cellphone or through a fiber cable, right? What do you think a hard to get (mine) and unfakeable, but easily and globally transferable "thing" could add to that thing, that disrupted the way we communicate or consume content, or order stuff? You know, the Internet?
H: well...woah.

I don't think it's even a bit of a great idea, to bid on the name of a few bit of Bits,
getting associated with a bit of money, transferred with a few Mbit per second in bits and bytes,
with a arguably bit of volatility, because if you want to buy or sell
a litte bit (fractions) of your Bits, you get to check the bids, and have to wait a little bit until it confirmed,
or getting a faster confirmation if you paid a little bit more per byte.
So, I think, it could be a little bit less confusing,
to talk/say about "a few Sat's" as a somehow clear indicator,
of what your are talking about (money/fraction of bitcoins),
and somehow sounds better - at least to me.

there will be a solution, sooner or later.
One thing that we all have in common is, we want Bitcoin to succeed.
It isn't a question if - but when, a scaling solution is accepted.
And I'm pretty sure... even if it takes another year or two, bitcoin miners and hodlers will agree to some kind of solution, to keep Bitcoin alive.
Except, *conspiracy here* someone wants to get rid of BTC. Well then just go on... let's not have a tx/s increase.
but this will just lead to a shift to another "coin". One that is preferred by that entity which wants to get rid of BTC.
One which can be centrally controlled, rolled back and so on...

This is the case for everyone investing in anything, somehow, I guess.
If you don't see utility in bitcoin, you shouldn't "invest".

Dude, read what i wrote a few days ago:
Also, read again, I was not talking about 5% markup ... I was talking about 25% (1000$ above spot price), which is a ripoff and scam by any means!
Again, everything above 7-9% isn't acceptable, because there are obviously shitloads of BTMs that can operate in that (or lower) range. And we'Re not even talking about the other shitloads of options to aquire/exchange cash for BTC thats cheaper than 7-9% in overall fees or costs. Got it!?
So, if your BTM isn't profitable with decent rates like all the others, you're doing something wrong (location, costs of rent, whatever).
Or you just don't give a fuck and want to try how many people fall for that ...

No. What is the point?
some of them heard about Bitcoin, some read the dumb media stuff about...you know, the dark darknet, laundering, drugs... and how we Nerds are all Tools in a wider conspiracy, establishing a one world currency to rule us all... crap
nah, seriously.
I know plenty of 50+ people, using smartphones, WA, FB, all the shit...
they install it, they get like 20€ credit and they use it to pay for Sushi delivered, pay a few drinks, whatever!
They are already used to it, because they pay for games online,..you know, farmville stuff, which they *collect* some cards (think steam-vouchers) at the next supermarket to buy diamonds for their beloved game.
it is the same. only difference is, to explain how this is actual money, gold, international, not controlled by a single company... et al...
in europe it's easy... everybody knows ECB is printing shitloads of Euros every month, which is bad for Granny, her Aunty and all of the hard working familiy.
Time will tell.
*Digital Gold* as a medium of permanent international exchange does not interfere with paying for Webcamservices (from / to all over the world) of all kind, 1hour subscriptions, Coffee, Micro-Remittances,
45 diffeterent Copyright-Shareholders-get-paid-theit-fair-share-per-Cick/View,  ...etcetera.
And as the Lightning Network on Bitcoin demonstrates, all of this is highly possible!
So, again, If I tell a 50+ person to give him or her 20€ in BTC,
without further supervision I want him/her to spend that, on something.
Is that the challenge?
@_date: 2018-12-24 00:24:57
If you had some BTC, which is decentralized digital worldwide Cash Money, with already enough people all over the world selling their goods or services...
who could stop you to "transport" it? (remember, it is digital)
who could stop you to spend it?
on whatever you want?
without anyone knowing ?

Europe, Austria, Vienna: winner of Mercers Study "most liveable City" in the world... again, for years.
This numbers compare 2014 to 2018 (as today).
Ham 200g (not the good one)
1,69 / 2,09 €
Milk 1L (not Bio)
0,85 /1,29 €
Emmentaler Cheese 200g
1,69 / 2,29 €
Buying a Flat 2015 was 50% more expensive than 2010 (same m²)
Renting a (used/old) Flat 2010, was 27% cheaper as it was 2015 (and way more in 2018)

Depends on a lot of things.
Your schema puts it way to easy, especially as there is/will be always an incentive for someone. So your assumption is flawed right from the start.

2-way-BTM are a good thing.
yes, they tend to have higher prices, because they offer special advantages.
yes, they have to pay rent for the location they are established.
yes, someone had to pay for the machine to be developed.
yes, someone had to pay for the machine to be built.
yes, someone had to pay for delivery and setup in that location, yearly or monthly.
yes, someone has to pay for maintenance, taking Fiat-money out,  and so on....
yes, everything 7-9% above 'spot' for this service is too much!
And we will see much more competition in big cities in the next 2-3 years.
So long... take it or leave it, or learn what's possible.
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:03:54
4% is still a damn good deal, compared to mostly every other way to buy BTC, especially without registratin/identification!
@_date: 2018-12-26 15:13:01
ok, nevermind.
But 1000 US$ above spot is a clear ripoff, no matter what, thats around 25% premium. WTF?!
pls see my other replies in this thread.
Edit: of course you have to also pay these 25% premium if you buy every other smaller amount than 1 full BTC!! 
@_date: 2018-12-27 02:45:04

@_date: 2018-12-26 18:02:47
You should really lookout for another BTM with better rates, just in case. This could maybe help you  and 
It might be worth it, because if you consider selling, for example 0,267 BTC currently worth 1000$ at your BTM, it will only spit out less than 750$ to you... that is inacceptable, at least it would be to me.
Also check other BTC to Cash options, like "Local Trader" from Mycelium Wallet, or meet-ups in your area.
@_date: 2018-12-26 17:27:58
Funny you mention the mirror, as you totally confirm what some people might say about some Americans :)
There is no reason, no rationale for using a BTM with a 25% markup and therefore supporting such scammy behaviour.
"Higher fees" as you call it, might be 7-10% at the absolute maximum, which might be still somehow "acceptable" (for whomever, I don't know why to pay more for the same BTM service I could get at 3-5% markup with no difference).
25% markup isn't "higher fees" anymore, that is outright scam and ripoff.
That is all I say. Period.
@_date: 2018-12-24 00:02:24
Friendly guys with guns perlustrating / frisk you and everybody with orifices on your way to somewhere else.
Might be the case no matter what.
But Bitcoiners don't care. Because there can't be a global electricity/Internet fallout.
But yes, if this should ever be the case, worldwide, ... Cigarettes, Antibiotica and other stuff are the currencies to go.
@_date: 2018-12-26 14:14:13
If it shows 150$ above current Marketprice, for example of 3820$ per 1 BTC, this is around 4%.
That is quite cheap, compared to many other BTMs and other methods I saw recently.
Main point is, you can just insert some cash and have your BTC quite instantly.
Most of these machines don't have KYC/AML for the tiny amounts (up to 250$ per buy, AFAIK).
Might be well worth the premium, for not going through your bank, to an exchange and potentiall hassles with ID, verification...
For example with Mycelium Wallets feature "Local Trader", sellers for cash in my area offer prices at around Krakens Rate + up to 5%, depending on the amount you wanna buy.
Don't forget, operating such a machine has some costs, too (purchase, rent the space, setup, maintenance, take out cash, and so on).
@_date: 2018-12-26 17:00:05
Where in Canada?

Expensive? You never made a single international money transfer, did you?
By the way, if you manage to swipe left or right on Tinder, you are intelligent enough to find send/recieve buttons in a Wallet-App just to *USE* bitcoin.
Or are you going to tell me in detail how € / $ works under the hood? No... but you are using it every day ;D
@_date: 2018-12-26 14:22:30
10-20 what? Percent? No way.
I don't know any legit exchange, that charges you that insane amount per trade.
It always depends on the amount you want to buy and also the preferred way of how to doing that.
But in no way you should ever accept more than like 5 to 8% overall costs as the absolute maximum, no matter what amount of BTC you want to buy. Better look elsewhere then.
@_date: 2018-12-26 14:26:25
If that is true, I wouldn't even think one second about using this.
This sounds very close to Scam to me and you should report it (and write an online rating somewhere).
You know which company is operating it?
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:36:27
Dude, calm down.
Every BTM here in my country runs around 3 to 4% for buying, and around 4 to 6% for selling.
There is nothing wrong to make people aware that 25 eff'n % is a extreme ripoff and very close to outright scam! Especially if there are way cheaper methods to aquire.
Telling me to head over to co(i)nbase is the next stupid thing right after your following calculations, so I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna feed your trolling on christmas.
@_date: 2018-12-27 02:10:29
I'd guess, at this current stage it might maybe in the same range of theoretical probability, just as with Bitcoins protocol/code itself.
So the answer stays yes, but it's quite safe to assume it won't happen, or that there isn't anything that could lead to this scenario out of the blue.
But as in any Software, you never know who f*cks something up that stays undetected somehow.
On the other hand, I love the way Bitcoin and LN slowly develops, tests, integrates and well planned upgrading over many stages is happening, because of exactly that reason. I think everybody involved is well aware of the responsibility they have.

Agreed. Also on mainstream non-financial media, some so called journalists still spout that energy-waste argument by still citing Digiconomists plain wrong datasets, for example.
My observations are especially from one of the biggest german/austrian newssite and their forums, derstandard.at.
See, for example: 
Commentsections of these media outlets (do you know the Project Syndicate?  -  )
have been full of complete trolling and reciting the same wrong bullshit over and over again for over a year already.
But until recently, a heavy influx of new accounts showed up, which are dedicated just to discredit and defame not only every Pro-Bitcoin comment, but especially go full ad hominen / ad populus with wild and sometimes really ugly accusations.

Its still making money, for educated people.
One way or another.
Those who lost interest might just think, in one way or another, that 10-25% swings in a few weeks aren't enough to gain their attention.
thats okay.
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:50:52
As long as every boulevard newspaper follows the concerted "main concern" of "killing earth by using electricity for this stupid and unnecessary thing", based on those obviously fake digiconomist (de Vries) crap data, you can be sure of one thing:
In 1990 up to 2000 "naysayers" predicted the end of the world because of the Internet, for the same reasons Bitcoin died (or got killed), for every single same reason.
They had their reasons, to place this narratives and keep people away from it. As of today, some older people think, the Internet is something to avoid... because "reasons they wrote in the newspaper".
Don't be that guy,...  instead of spending € or $ 100 which you could easiliy afford to spend to a bottle of Vodka (retail price € 15) in a Club... make a better decision :) At least every once in a while.

German BaFin was kind of blocking BTMs, due to nearly impossible or unobtainable licenses and requrements.
AFAIK, Munich has (had?) one BTM since a few weeks, but not sure about that.
But there should be some places to spend BTC.
Maybe you'll find someone there, that likes to exchange for cash, too.
Maybe this helps (zoom to Germany):

Haha :D
My Mother took me aside after xmas dinner and asked me, if I'm okay and if I still got something to do with this computer-money thingy I mentioned years ago, because her newspaper wrote it's dead and everyone lost everything and their pants...
Well, she she couldn't understand that almost all family xmas presents (and much more...) of the last years, including this year, were paid in, or funded by what her newspaper called dead internet-money-thingy. :)
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:51:41
Go ahead, pay 25% ripoff markup then, have fun, nobody holds you back.
Not bitching around, just telling people with a eff'n 25% ripoff markup, where they can put that ;)
Everybody else will look out to the usual rates of 3-5%, or find another way to buy at a normal markup, without getting scammed.
@_date: 2018-12-27 01:47:54
Well, I'm pretty sure this conversation was over quite normal circumstances, western standard thingy, not something like 3rd-world-circumstances.
But yes, mentioning Caracas or Venezuela, you are right. But AFAIK even they use other, cheaper, methods to buy/aquire BTC.
Besides that, it would be stupid to risk a clunky BTM worth a 1000$ or way above that, in such a dangerous area. Just because there are at least 10 other ways to trade/exchange more secretly (and cheaper) than putting such a BTM up.
The same you can apply to what you call low volume area.
Why? Because, sellers use one of the dozen onlineservices, like localbitcoin, or there is someone in your town or the next one, that might help you out with what you need (like with every other stuff you might like ;))
As I said before... if you have BTC worth 1000$, but someone offers you only 750$ or less for that... you're going to think twice (at least!) about the other options. Right?
Because you could easily get out 900 to 950$ for the same amount of BTC, instead of only 750$ or less...
@_date: 2018-12-24 02:42:02
OK, could be.
Or I got you wrong.
In this case, sorry.
But even in my highly educated circle
(European Standard! Scientists etc), there are people (that I respect a lot!), even after calm talks... they call it a Pyramid Scheme, Enviromental Disaster.... worse than Drug/Blood Diamonds, because MSM wrote it, so it must be true for...something... 
That is okay for me.
I know better, and it's not my job to convince them.
If you understand it, what is your actual problem with it?
Are you not okay with your personal sovereignity?
Worldwide Freedom of your money/belongings?
Do you worship Krugman, Draghi?
Do you just like want a Leader, that tells you what it is the best for you?
Why not install intelligent Guys and Girls instead of power-hungry, corrupt, not even voted into their positions-scumbags in control of money?
I mean, we see Trump as the Leader of the so called most mighty Force in the world...

@_date: 2018-12-26 14:59:11
Could you give an example?
Because even that sounds totally insane to me and would lead me to tell others to avoid those exchange.
Not to promote anything, but with Kraken for example:
EUR per SEPA Deposit: Free
USD per Wire Deposit: seems to be 5$ flat.
Maker/Taker Fee: 0.16/0.26% per Trade 
Bitcoin Withdrawal Fee: ฿0.0005 = 1.87$ or 1,70€ currently
So, talking about the usual amount compared to what we might consider thrown into a BTM of say 250$, it is
5$ + 0.65$ + 1.87$ = 7,52$ sum up to overall 3%
In EUR even less.
But, you have to fully register and ID.
On that BTM mentioned by OP, it is around 4%, quite instant and (AFAIK, usually) no KYC/AML up to 250$.
Not a bad deal at all, I'd say.
*Edit: formatting

It's not expensive. You are lazy.
No, you don't have to pay multiple dollars to do that.
Current best and fastest Fee is 0.0868134912 US$
independent of if you want to send 5 dollar or 50 grand, 3 million or whatever US$, Euros, and to whatever destination in the world.
Yes, it's a pain in the ass, as long as you don't understand what it means to own some amount of bitcoins (or some fragments of them).
Yes, it has a learning curve.
But the same as sending a picture on whatsapp, if you just want to *use* it.
If you want to *understand* what is under the hood, technically and why it is, what it is, and whatnot... take your time.
I'm learning since a couple of years.
Remember, it is an online thing, not your Redneck-Walmart-I-pay-my-offline-sixpack-sh*t in person...
Everything you pay *offline* you use those fancy colored papers.

seems not to be published at the moment.

I was reading your previous stuff... after we had our today conversation.
and now I'm confused :D
@_date: 2018-12-31 16:21:10
Before using an BTM, make sure to check your areas usual fees!
3-5% is okay.
5-7% already quite expensive.
Everything above you should avoid if possible, and|or check for other ways to buy/sell your BTC.
@_date: 2018-12-24 02:47:07
That's right.
Don't trust - verify.
You come over to Vienna.

Same for most European Mainstream Media Outlets, which still use the most fucked up "Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index" from the ETH/BCH Enthusiast Alex de Vries, which was proven wrong many times, while spreading up to 3 times higher numbers of energy use, which was refuted as totally Bullshit in a few hundred articles and many months ago... but still is used by them, to create clickbait, FUD and whatever...
But, as a Bitcoiner, it helps to understand the Structure of owners from MSM Outlets, if you read this:  (ENG)
or this  (GER)
With names like Roubini, Stiglitz or Varoufakis on board, you know what their goal is.

I repeat, as long as you can't name any, I'm sure you are just trolling or the scammy owner of one of these 25% ripoff-BTMs.
Nothing changes. I'll not stop telling people that they don't have to pay 25% markups but can have their BTC, with the exact same service, for like **5 to 6 times fewer markup**.
But you know that already, right? Since people stopped being so stupid to use your 25% ripoff-BTM, right?
Those damn people, just went to another BTM with decent markups, boohoohoo... watshoudidooo?...
Now stfu, fix your rates to normal (like 4-6%), and stop bothering me.

The main point here is: you did 3 clicks to move your wealth from co(i)nbase into your sole and only posession. thats the key. the only key that matters in bitcoin, is that you are the absolute single owner of the key. If you have your coins tied to any company... you don't have or own bitcoins.
