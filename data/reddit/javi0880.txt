I downloaded Ledger Live in a different computer to try again and same error:
 Oops, wrong device for ‘BitC’. The connected device is not associated with the account you selected. Please connect the right device.

Nothing... same thing. It takes my Nano S as if it was a different one...
When I log into my Bitcoin account in Ledger Live it says this:
´´Oops, wrong device for ‘BTC’.
The connected device is not associated with the account you selected. Please connect the right device.´´

At least happy to hear this: ''...unlikely you wrote down the wrong seed considering that only 1 in 256 combinations''   Thanks!
The last time I received cryptos using Ledger Live was Sept 24 2018 and the last time I succesfully sent was Sept 21 2018. I don't use Chrome apps since long ago.

Yes I entered my 24 words correctly. The Ledger Live appears with no Cryptos and when I add Accounts they appear empty.

I am very sorry for loosing your time and maybe Ledger´s image for some!
It was MY silly ERROR, I had the right words of an older Ledger with empty accounts and the right words of the actual Nano S but in a different order I did not remember until today... so now it WORKS WELL.
Thank you very much for trying to help and again, sorry for loosing your time!
Best regards,

better now?

Yes, I have successfully sent BTC with Ledgerlive. No, I didn´t use a passphrase. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:57:14
That is what I did. I tried in a different computer, downloaded ledger live, did the recovery using the 24 words and nothing... only empty accounts.
@_date: 2018-11-09 18:45:24
I don´t understand the first part. What do you mean more than one seed?
No, I never used a passphrase.
@_date: 2018-11-09 19:23:09
Okay, I understand what you mean but I only have one Ledger. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 21:43:40
No, I think I have to manage to restore my Ledger Live because I have other cryptos such as litecoin, Z'cash etc. But the big problem is that my Nano S appears empty in Ledger Live...
@_date: 2018-11-09 19:43:18
Using my Ledger Nano S?
If so, which one?
I had some Neo in a Neon account in which I logged in with my Nano S. Sudenly the account was also empty because a new wallet replaced the one I always used with my nano S in Neon.

They do appear in Ledger Live, but when I log my nano S in I am not able to do a transaction. 
Yes, I use the latest version of Bitcoin in my Nano S
