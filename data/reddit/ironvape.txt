Yes. Really.  
From 3 starting points around the world, the physical locations of all the target nodes could be determined with nothing more than ping time and TTL.  Trace routes would help but are not necessary.  Map the results from the 3 data sets to a sphere and VPNs will appear to be in orbit while the honest nodes will all be on the surface.  More than 3 starting points = more accurate location.  Ideally, all of the nodes participate in the verification process and reach consensus.

Every coin in existance is effectivly sold every day.  The decision to **not** trade your coin for fiat at today's price is logically the same decision as purchasing that coin for fiat today - minus transaction costs.

it is not impossible to overcome the Sybil problem.  
Nodes have physical existence and can be located by the route that packets travel.  A reward system based on physical dispersion could be built.  
EG:  10,000 nodes in a San Francisco data center split the same reward amount that goes to 1 node alone in Argentina.  Sybiling does not increese your reward in this example, rather it simply increeses your costs.

Not exactly.  
Done correctly, an audit produces a snapshot from which account holders can later confirm that their coin existed at that time.  
Also, it does not require every account holder to verify, as long as a significant percentage do, the odds of getting caught cheating become very high.

Yes, and here's another thought that may help both merchants and buyers acceptance.
The buyer has the option to convert to BTC or use it at fiat value at the merchant.  That way the buyer is protected from any sudden drop in BTC between purchase and conversion, and the merchant gets (worst case) "x" dollars of dedicated business and the original load fee.
Just a thought.

The net effect is a very small increese in coin price.  The fact that the merchants accept bitcoin creates slightly more demand than the increese in supply when they reconvert.

The very rough formula to determine the minimum value of bitcoin assuming the it is all being converted to fiat on both sides of the transaction would be:
(400,000,000,000 *0.01) / (13,000,000 * %available to be used * Bitcoin Velocity / 2) = 
Rough guess 1 to 10 USD.
The trading price is anybody's guess because there are other competing uses and Velocity and Availability are unknowns.  
If people tend to keep it and use it as savings and for transactions rather than converting back to fiat, however, all bets are off and we go to the moon. [edit] decimal point :-)

The question does not have a simple yes/no answer.
One must consider:
1.  The time frame: per year?, per month?, per minute?
2.  The point of refrence:  1BTC = 1Btc, therefore volatility = none. Unless you state what you want to compare it to.
Note: On a long time frame ( one year or so ) Bitcoin is moving up vs most all comparisons.  Moving up and moving down are both volatility, but few people bitch about upward movement.

It sounds like a great idea, and I don't see any reason it couldn't be adapted to an individual's needs.  For example:
My cold storage address= unlimited withdrawal
Overstock or Tiger = max of 1 BTC / day
All other addresses combined total of 0.5 BTC per day.
Sort of like the way banks put a limit on AMT withdrawal, except you get to set the limits and recipients yourself.

No offense but the OP is correct about the tax ramifications of this type of in-and-out transaction - assuming we are talking about US federal income tax.
It is important to keep the "spending wallet" separated from whatever other wallets you may have.  And to draw down the balance of the spending wallet soon after the deposit is made.

If you measure the value of the US dollar by it's rate on any exchange at any moment, then I've no doubt that there have been plenty of exchanges in history on which the USD has fallen 80% in a day.

A 51% attack isn't as simple as it might sound.  It only gives you a 51% chance of inserting a counterfeit block. And a 49% chance of tipping your hand without even getting that one block in.
As soon as the attack starts, the remanning 49% basically surrender and let you run your own little counterfeit fork, effectively isolating you from the rest of the network.
I'm still learning about this ,but basically, it is not as easy or as detrimental as it sounds.

That sounds about right given your assumptions.  But there are quite a few other factors that combine to move the shutdown point [the point at which machines get turned off] lower:
1.  Full scale mining operations do not set up shop in areas with high electricity costs.
2.  Newer more efficient miners are constantly comming on line.
3.  An unknown number of miners - legally and illegally - do not pay for their electricity.
4.  Hobbyists, and enthusiasts mine for the fun of it and don't turn off period.
The network wide shutdown point [ where hash rate would steeply decline ] is more like $100 or less.

A 401k and an IRA are not the same thing.
If it is an inactive 401k ( from a previous employer ) you can roll it into an IRA and if your IRA allows self managed alternative investments, then you can move to bitcoin without any penalty.
If it is an active 401k , you may be able to take a loan against it if the plan allows for loans.

Basically it's a credit swap.  Any pair of wallet or payment providers can agree to trust each other up to a certain amount of $.  So... let's say that Coinbase has a US$2,000 swap deal with Bitpay.  When a Coinbase customer pays a Bitpay merchant a micro-payment,  there is no blockchain transaction for it, Coinbase and Bitpay simply agree that the money is owed from one to the other.  When one of the parties owes the other $2,000 then they do a single blockchain transaction for the total due.

After further thought, is doesn't really protect the buyer because 100$ of bitcoin is 100$ of bitcoin no matter how you slice it.

1.) use the network map to determine the longitude and latitude of each node.
2.) rank each node according to the average distance between itself and it's 50 nearest nodes, so that the most distant from the pack rank the highest.
3.) set up a voluntary contribution fund to reward all nodes some coin based on how high they rank.
TA-da!  Now people will set up physically dispersed nodes because they get rewarded for it.
Obviously, more is involved than this simplified view, but it could be done, could be verified, and could be automated.  Attach it to 1% of the total transaction fee per block and your on your way to a long term solution to the centralization problem

They snap together air tight so it's kinda tricky to reopen them but, yes, you can reopen them without damaging them.  You could drop a tiny bit of modeling glue when you closed them to make them permanent if you wated to. That would cause the plastic to actually bond so that they had to be broken to acces the private key.

Is that a real question?  How do you not give a discount? Answer: you simply do not divide the data count by 4.   


Yes.  As the block reward diminishes over time, the security incentive is designed to be supplemented with fees from an increasing number of transactions..  A 75% fee discount and a fixed block size combine to drastically reduce the potential fee per block, thereby reducing the amount of POW that a miner will spend to secure a block.

I suggest 3, to roughly mimic the proposed SW expansion, but it has no bearing on the discount amount.  


UTXO cost is mostly memory, Blockchain cost is mostly disk,  but you already know that.   


Yes.  It is specifically the discount that reduces the potential fee that can be assessed for any given total amount of data that a miner must verify.
@_date: 2017-01-08 13:55:32
From my point of view, selling block space at a 75% discount is a long term threat to Bitcoin's security model.  SegWit and all of its features could be implemented without this discount.  Perhaps then we would see some interest by miners.

Opening up more space for more transactions is good, selling that space at a 75% discount is not.

They create empty blocks so that the solution propagates acress the network at maximum speed and increeses the likelihood that their solution gets included in the blockchain.

got it... very cool.  I'm thinking that with some sort of temporary block chain (maybe as side chain) you could build an app so for this?
@_date: 2015-03-11 21:11:41
Yes.  I see your post below now.  You are correct.

No.  But the potential use cases are becoming more real and that is making speculation more attractive.

Copying to Word prior to encryption is a bad idea.
's instructions / advice is very complete but also take steps to insure that the password for your BIP38 wallets is recoverable somehow if you were to die or get into an accident or just forget.

Funny guy.  The Fed's promise to buy back it's own notes is only a little bit less believable than GAW's promises to buy paycoins.

Sooner than immediately.  Simply the confirmation of of the existence of a coalition (read centralization) of power large enough to attempt this blackmail game would kick price down 50%.

Distroying the value of the network in order to double the amount of (now valueless) coins that you receive does not make sense.
There are cheaper was to distroy the network.

What's the easiest way to get some USD?  I'd like to try it out and see if it works.  I ask random people on the Internet to give me USD but they can't seem to figure out how to do it without some 3rd party involved.  I went to a USD bank and asked for some but they say that I have to have an account and then they want me to give them USD.  
This whole USD thing is too hard to get.  I don't think it will ever catch on.

Ok.  Cool.  Sorry if I was rough.  I've seen so many physical bitcoin scams that I thought this was another attempted robbery.

I give up... what are you selling?
Surely you're not expecting me to give you my private key or trust a private key that you send me.

Yep,  the "fight you" stage started just over a year ago.  This article is nothing but a PR stunt.  Trying to define the battle ground as "digital currency" instead of "crypto currency". As if 99% of the fiat wasn't already digital.  These guys see a way of increasing the money supply without having to admit that its just more QE.
If we compare it to the US civil rights movement, we're in the stage where "separate but equal" was the offer on the table.

Confirmations are the number of blocks which have been added to the blockchain since your transaction.  For any small amount 1 confirmation is probably sufficient to insure that the person you are buying from has not simultaneously sold the same coins to someone else.  2 confirms  is more than twice as safe.
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:13:26
a watch only wallet is just a way of referring to the public part of the key.  You can "watch" any address if you know the public key.  We all watch Satoshi's coins to see if he spends any.  :-)

Ownership is transferable.  Bitcoin never leaves the blockchain.  That's why it can't be copied.

Go to blockchain.info and put in your receiving address.  If the coins are there, and you haven't lost the private key, you will be fine.

That's just bad financial management no matter how you justify it. 
If you want to give your friend some money... then just give him some money.
If you want to give him a chance to make money then buy him a lotto ticket.
If you want to invest in bitcoin, then buy some bitcoin.
Confusing all three actions into one does not make them a good idea.
