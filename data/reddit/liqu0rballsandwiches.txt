i cant even begin to describe how hard i laughed at you on the inside after reading your first 2 lines.  get the fuck outta here with this crap, bitcoin just helped me put a down payment on my new home
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:30:36
write back, in all sincerity, suck my dick
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:44:41

@_date: 2017-12-21 21:33:32
i had a deposit go through for $2,200 on aug 2nd at 7:30...does that mean i dont get any BCH?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:21:15
i just did my first deposit last night and the transaction went through in like 3 mins...given i am in the US but do they not support the UK?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:14:33
how? i get paid out like once a month if im lucky
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:28:10
you always fear what you dont understand
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:30:41
so you think you may have 4 million in BTC, and you are going to wait 2 weeks to find out?  something seems fishy here...i call bs
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:09:07
Can anyone assist here? I click remove and nothing happens.  The amount has not gone back into my wallet...what do I need to do?
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:27:31
ok..but why?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:00:45
when did this happen?  i am waiting for one more transaction to complete and transfer it to coinbase and then i am done with them.  will i run into issues if this is tuesday next week?
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:17:12
i just sent 100 and the fee was 5...and the transaction isnt moving at all.  is it like this for everyone?
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:39:40
You are correct, using a 1070 so not wasting.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:55:19
if you bought in at 640 and it bottomed out at 450...that means you lost 190...where are you getting 600 from?
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:52:46
Ya I haven’t even gotten the email from them saying I sent it 
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:59:27
bad name?  i pretty much strictly use bitcoin for gambling online.  they made it so easy for deposits and withdrawals.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:40:44
I don’t pay electricity, so you are wrong 
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:09:38
oh ok thanks
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:51:17
genuine thank you, cause i was a bit confused
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:22:41
i went to the coin base site and sold through there and it says it completed and gave me a date it will deposit...should i still contact support?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:22:30
i doubt they will do that, but if they do...onto the next one i guess
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:09:21
Same here! 
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:34:29
can someone ELI5?  i mine with a GPU, havent really noticed a difference.  what should i be butthurt about?
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:05:37
Honestly no idea, but it would be really dumb if they are because so many ppl will leave 
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:13:54
Lol sure ya do...I’m so glad I got out at 18 and not sweating this bs everyday. Good luck Bitcoin is dead as disco bud

@_date: 2017-11-27 16:57:37
i assume hes mining ETH and converted to bitcoin through nicehash
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:40:58
whats so hard to understand? most people never through it would get this big and have been able to cash out a significant life changing amount of money.  If bitcoin is always held and never used its worth 0
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:03:13
still have no use? lol tell that to my closing agent tomorrow morning when im closing on my new home
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:29:58
It’s not like it gets affected immediately 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:16:19
same, was just about to post this myself.  is the pool that full right now?
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:43:29
Did you use a credit card or bank account 
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:20:15
so just transfer funds from coinbase to GDAX and then just use GDAX from then on?
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:53:20
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:22:44
Credit cards are instant, from banks it takes 4-5 days 
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:31:46
except it wont let me get passed the driver license stage so i cant use it anyway.  
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:53:56
so i see all this celebrating...if bitcoin went up in value shouldnt my account balance went up as well?  cause it didnt and it went down almost 27%...can you explain this to me?
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:04:39
My bitcoin balance in my wallet
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:35:03
ok, baby dick
