With the views you described, you're not what I would typically call a leftist. Gun ownership for example is associated with conservative politics.


I still don't understand why socialists, communists, left-anarchists or other left-wing people would be interested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:14:41


Yes it is, that's exactly the question because bitcoin is entirely on-chain today. We have to work with the technologies we have otherwise we engage in utopianism.
On-chain absolutely sucks for privacy and I'm glad we're moving away from it.
I'm glad you're thinking about this stuff because it's important, but you're a big blocker who constantly posts on r/btc which is incredibly bad for your reputation. Sadly you're interest isn't to help bitcoin or LN.


Let's say the cost of opening a channel is a massive $100. That means the maximum a node could rent-seek is $100, because anything above that will result in the user having an incentive to open another channel.
You can disguise and fake things all you want with sybils, but you can't fake the fee that the user pays. If the user sees their payment channel fee going up dramatically they will know something is up and will be thinking about opening other channels.

It would be harmful to decentralization. Because it makes full nodes more costly to run, and gives an unfair benefit to large miners at the expense of small ones.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:45:44


Could you explain this for a libertarian like me? What do leftists see in bitcoin?
Leftists are typically against private property and want to seize it / tax it. Bitcoin is property that is easy to hide, it cannot be seized, blocked or frozen no matter how many strikes and occupations the leftists organize.
Leftists are typically against markets, bitcoin uses market forces fundamentally for it's operation.

It can't be worse than having all your transactions publicly viewable to everyone, forever.
Also, that node can hardly engage in rent-seeking if users are free to open alternative channels with anybody else.

1. Loads of them. There's about 200 countries and only a small number had the chance to be evil empires. For example take Iceland.

I'm not deflecting the issue. You talk about responsibility but you take none of it yourself when wars and oil comes up. All the while bleet bleeting about children blah blah blah terrorism blah blah tax evasion responsibility.

I also like how our side is a "community" and you are just an individual. Why don't you try being a community as well, you might stop some wars.
The money laundering link is incredibly tenuous. Money laundering is about making dirty money look clean, if you had a bunch of ill\-gotten cash you would attract more suspicion, not less, by converting it into bitcoin and mixing. Exactly the same stuff was said about internet communication and encryption. Talking privately to anyone in the world would be a recipe for human trafficking and smuggling they said.
It's time to accept that \*any\* technology can be used for good or evil. The evil done is no argument against bitcoin any more than it's an argument against the internet, the automobile or the telephone.

This is a ridiculous comparison. How do you even make that leap from financial privacy to abducting children.
To stop terrorism and human trafficking, maybe the great powers shouldn't be bombing and colonizing middle eastern countries and inciting wars every chance they get. Bitcoin has literally nothing to do with that except in your delusional head. What's more, tax collection was totally possible even back when everyone used private and fungible cash for everything.
Kindly STFU and lurk more.

People simply shouldn't buy stuff they can't afford.
If they want to buy a house they should save for it. People not buying stuff with other people's money that they can't afford will make house prices fall, so you'd have to save less than $500k equivalent.
Easy access to loans doesn't just pump up real estate prices. Credit cards, car loans, payday loans etc contribute to consumerism and materialism. Which is destroying people's souls, making them chase stupid pointless possessions instead of the really important things, stressing them out because they think they need the biggest car or fanciest smartphone in order to be happy. It is also destroying the environment with pollution and trash. That's not the world I want to live in, and bitcoin is part of the solution.

Master public keys are used for creating watch-only wallets, they're nothing to do with verifying a seed. You can always obtain the master public key if you have the seed. Keep the seeds safe and that's all you need to do to store your money.

I have a 2-of-2 multisig wallet created with Electrum. The seed phrases are written down on paper in multiple places but they are encrypted with a passphrase that is written down in a separate place and that I've also memorized.
I mostly just hodl so the seed phrases are kept offline, but if I ever need to spend them I can import the seeds into two different computers and both of the computers need to get hacked in order for my money to be stolen. Electrum allows you to create a watch-only wallet, which I've connected to Electrum Personal Server so I can keep track of my funds with privacy and without risk of hackers.
I've left instructions for me heirs. They aren't very bitcoiny people but it shouldn't be too hard to download Electrum and type in the seed phrases and passphrase.

You can turn those questions around, why would anyone accept an inflationary currency when they know it will be worth less tomorrow?
That "modern advanced flexible" economy is based on tricking people. A pay increase of 2% when inflation is 5% is equivalent to a 3% pay cut. But because psychology people will accept that more readily than an actual 3%. If you want to pay people less you should be honest about it, not create inflation to steal from them by stealth.
Not to mention your "modern advanced flexible" economy is mostly based on pointless consumerism and assumptions about infinite growth.

The fact that you're using "blockchain" in the singular sense e.g. *"Blockchain is going to revolutionize the finance industry!"* means you have no freaking idea.
