@_date: 2016-04-03 12:29:17
WTF does have to do with this? 
@_date: 2016-04-03 22:26:32


That's not what he said and you know it. We're talking about the IMF transcript discussed in the ZeroHedge article. It's an insightful conversation, but hardly scandalous. 
@_date: 2016-04-03 12:28:21
Yeah I read the transcript and there's no "plan to cause a credit event". 
They are saying that a credit event needs to happen or Greece will keep postponing it. *They were right!*
@_date: 2016-04-03 22:27:25
They're waiting for a credit event because it's the only thing that will make the Greek gov't give a fuck. 
@_date: 2016-04-03 12:30:53
In [the transcript]( some IMF staffer discusses the Greek crisis and they agree that a credit event needs to happen or Greece will keep postponing it.  
 They were right.
The post title is clickbait as usual. Fuck this sub. 
@_date: 2016-04-03 22:24:28
Um, no. There are plenty of decent-to-good articles on sites like FT and Bloomberg. 
Most of the ZH articles that you see linked on reddit (including this one!) are full of shit. 
@_date: 2016-04-03 22:32:38
Huh wow, even ZH commenters can see through the clickbait :)
@_date: 2015-12-29 17:42:41


Yup, that's called Treasury Management. Most business accounts have it. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 17:38:10


In the US, this is wrong. You can ask your bank to stop all withdrawals to specific originators and account numbers. 
Oh and nearly all companies in the US have treasury management. Which means their server gets a list of ACH/check transactions and approves them one by one if they match an entry in the accounting book. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:12:03
Sure you can, I've gone a few thousand dollars into overdraft before :)
@_date: 2015-12-29 17:43:48
He's saying that you can't steal his BTC using his account number.

The car buyer can verify certified checks by calling your bank. Or he could deposit it at his bank before giving you the keys. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 13:47:44




Emphasis mine. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:43:44
Yes, and many people made those modifications. There are political issues/asshats blocking widespread use of the new code. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 17:46:26
Thanks for the details, but I still wouldn't accept &gt;2k cash as payment: 
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:48:53
...or you wait until your bill reaches 0.999 Satoshi and then tell the hospital to fuck off so they never get paid.  
Congrats, you defeated the whole point of cryptocurrencies. Microtransactions mean nothing until they're on-chain. Much like credit card transactions that can be disputed after the fact. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:38:33
I guess so. Bitcoin is notable because it has stuck to the 1MB limit for no goddamn reason. Segwit helps a little, but it's nothing significant. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 13:28:55
Most sellers in the US  are not like that. Cash is risky because you never know if it is counterfeit. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:18:04
Sure, pay less transaction fees than what your wallet/client recommends.
 You'll get committed eventually, but it could take days until a slot opens up. Some miners even accept transactions with $0 fees. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:45:06
It's just supply/demand. 
The block size is still so small that you have to pay exorbitant rates for your transaction to be committed in a reasonable time frame. If you paid any less, other people's transactions would get committed first. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 16:02:14
With your eyes and a UV pen? Get real. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:21:54
People with more expensive hardware will win just as often with larger block sizes. 
Specifically, someone with twice the hash rate will get twice the reward. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:51:31
Smart contracts settle as soon as miners can verify who the money should be paid to. 
Waiting until both parties agree lets buyers screw sellers. Sure the buyer has nothing to gain by delaying payment forever, but they'll do it anyway. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:21:08
If lightning has the same semantics as "Once your bill collects enough to be a whole Satoshi, you settle on-chain" then it's vulnerable to the same problem. 
If not, your reply is off topic and he's still full of shit :P 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:26:48
SPV wallets already let you transact in the full bitcoin network with only a few megabytes of storage. The only limit is the block size. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:28:44
Is this satire?

@_date: 2015-08-17 17:41:55
This isn't tho
@_date: 2015-08-13 15:19:09
eh? ASICs consume less power than GPUs. 
@_date: 2019-06-01 01:54:12
This sub is indeed hilarious.
@_date: 2015-08-26 21:59:44
Oh neat, I didn't know they had a maker-taker model. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 17:57:48
Heh is forking with no warnings 
@_date: 2015-08-26 08:17:58
Serious question: Why do people pay 1% on CoinBase withdrawals? There are other exchanges with lower fees. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 16:56:14
So tr0ub4d0r has less entropy than the word string right? 
@_date: 2015-08-17 17:50:30
Naw, only one can survive. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 09:56:42


wtf no 
@_date: 2015-08-14 15:36:29


How so? 
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:38:11
Right, typo. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:42:11
Don't expect too much. Shitty reliability, but you *do* get a static IPv4 address. So still worth $1 :)
@_date: 2016-02-29 09:50:14


And nobody paid that rate :)
@_date: 2016-02-29 09:49:08
He'd nationalize health insurance and education. It may or may not be the lesser evil, but why not call a spade a spade? 
@_date: 2016-02-29 09:41:39
Don't use a VPN. Use a VPS and run your own OpenVPN. Starts at $1/mo with sites like ChicagoVPS. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 09:40:19
If he's looking for $100/mo, it's pretty hard to get ripped off. (Assuming he settles the initial payments daily)
@_date: 2016-02-29 09:43:47
BTC mining is capital intensive if you want to be profitable any time soon. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 12:02:28
Maybe once the CFTC starts regulating BTC. For now, there is no reason to believe that insider trading cryptocurrencies is illegal. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 23:29:49
Well, I'm interested in BTC because of smart contracts. 
has a point. Most people like gov't backed corporations such as banks. You can't change people. If they want banks to hold BTC, let them. Even if it's highly regulated, these things ease the transition  between bank transfers and BTC transactions. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 07:48:58
Makes sense, huge chargeback risk and fees for porn sites. Anything is better than credit cards for them. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:07:29
How is this a regression? 
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:07:25
That's what we have right now... It can't get any worse. Only better. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 12:05:23
I think/hope he was being sarcastic. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 12:03:54
So what? You need bank accounts to transact with most people. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 07:51:52
Can confirm. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 11:04:46




Bullshit: 


The average person doesn't want bitcoin. At best, merchants want it because of low transactions fees and no chargeback risk. I do think it's good for society tho. It makes a lot of regulations unenforceable. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 07:26:24
Yeah most CC transactions settle in 2-3 days. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:48:38
More flips is also fine. As long as it doesn't take longer than mining coins. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:30:23
meh, just keep flipping bits with a script till you get a private key with a balance. 
As long as the edit distance isn't too large, you can brute force the errors away :) 
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:53:47
That's not ideal, but I can see why why (AML laws) they don't do cash refunds.
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:52:21
lol no, why would you assume that?
