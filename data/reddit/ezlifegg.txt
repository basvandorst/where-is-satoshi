Like Andreas said, many of us dismissed it the first time but later came back and realized it was the future.
In 2011 I thought things were going too slow because I couldn't find any sellers in my location, and international wires had been forbidden in my country (and I'm not a hardware guy, so I didn't want to risk my money in buying video cards to mine). Two years later I came back, there were sellers everywhere, and I jumped in just in time to enjoy the roller coaster :p

I didn't read everything, but I wanted to tell you that you shouldn't be using bitcoin-qt anyway, or any non-HD wallet for that matter.
If you are going to download the blockchain anyway, use Armory, which is waaaay better and super complete. They also improved the way the blockchain is downloaded I think, or you can use torrent.
If you want to skip the download just use Electrum.
With both, you will be able to backup once and be safe forever.
If you need basic security ASAP: boot with a Linux DVD (preferably Tails), install Electrum (I think Tails comes with it installed), print the backup, generate an address, and send the coins there. That's it. You can try sending a small amount first to make sure the address is correct.

Nothing is black or white. You can be an early adopter, but obviously not as early as before. Time is a continuum. It goes like this: First time he hears about Bitcoin he dismisses it. Price goes up, he hates himself and starts hating Bitcoin, because he feels like he missed the train. Price goes up again, his hate grows, and so do his efforts to attack Bitcoin and convince people to not using it. And so on and so forth. Note that at any point he could have let the hate go, jump in, and enjoy freedom and extraordinary gains in little time (a couple of years). But sometimes hate and fear are too strong. How would he feel if he invested now, after years of predicting its failure, and Bitcoin ended up failing? Like the biggest idiot ever. That scares him to death. So instead, he tries to force his prophecy to become a reality.
What mentally healthy people would do: Either ignore Bitcoin or invest in it.
What people like patio11 do: Spend their days hating on a technology and trying to make it fail, because they can't afford (the mental damage of) seeing it succeed knowing they could have invested in it.

See the comments in Mozilla's blog post.

When "businessmen" like try to do it, they will invariably fall for at least a couple of them. Besides that, statistics are used to outright lie, by almost everyone one way or another. It's very common in politicians and company executives.

If you already installed Armory, just create an address with it and send the coins there. No need to wait for the blockchain. In fact, you can create the address from the offline machine. Your Armory wallet is already encrypted I presume.

Or maybe the government, who is also known to spend millions in astroturfers. Who knows. In any case, your agenda is showing.

They can challenge and create all the altcoins they want. But posing as Bitcoin supporters, when they are not, is done only to create an atmosphere of negativity, and try to promote altcoins by harming Bitcoin. That's why most altcoins are harmful, and not the healthy competitors they claim to be at all. They don't add anything, they only try to bite Bitcoin's cake by attacking Bitcoin and trying to confuse naive people.

This is why we need a multi-signature wallet that lets us interact with 3rd party services to hold some of the keys and set withdraw limits.
In the meantime you should just use Armory's multi-signature, or any HD wallet plus Shamir's Secret Sharing.
Create a 3-of-3 scheme. Give key  to a friend, key  to a family member, and keep key  at home. To be safe against a fire, or an aggressor who steals/destroy one of the keys even if he gets nothing out of it, also keep a copy of  and  at a safe and inconvenient place, like buried somewhere far away from home, and a copy of  (or maybe  and  encrypted in the cloud.
With this scheme you are safe from fires, and you also can't hand your bitcoins right away even if you wanted to. But you can recover your bitcoins with some inconvenience and knowledge (where the other keys are, and the password if you also use the encrypted ones from the cloud) when you need to.

Nice investigation. But to be honest, it could be anyone with similar profile. Living 30 minutes away from a restaurant called Satoshi is like the weakest evidence ever.

Nothing to see here, just another known Bitcoin hater that spends his spare time looking for new arguments against Biticoin, for no other reason than being angry for missing the train. He's been doing this for years. First he didn't like that someone other than the government could create money, then he didn't like that Bitcoin didn't follow mainstream Economics ~~theories~~ dogma, then he didn't like that the price went up so much. Then he became more technical and kept trying to find arguments for why Bitcoin will fail any time now. In the end he's just a Ruby/Rails developer, he has no valuable cryptographic knowledge.

Accepting Bitcoin is way more secure than accepting credit cards. It's like accepting cash. You won't suffer any chargebacks from this, nor fees. That's why many merchants choose to pass the savings to the customers, and charge them *less*, not more.

What is a blockchain wallet? Do you mean a Blockchain.info wallet? Blockchain is a Bitcoin term, and Blockchain.info is just random wallet service that stole the term and now confuses everyone.
In any case, wallets typically work like this: any time you create a new address, the wallet stores the private key behind the scenes, because that's what's needed to spend coins from that address. Anyone with access to a private key, can spend the coins from its respective address (unless it's a multi-signature address, which requires multiple private keys).

Right, to actually send the coins with bitcoin-qt you need the blockchain.
If you don't trust that machine anymore, then just download Mycelium to your phone if you have one, sweep the private key, scan the qr code of your address generated by Armory, and send the coins in a second.
If you trust your machine more than your phone, just wait for the blockchain, or download a different wallet like Electrum, just to send the coins to your Armory address.

There are other things in the world besides marketing, you know?
For example, choosing a TLD is also a matter of security. I don't know about .solutions, but .com, .net, and .org are some of the most prone to be seized, since they are controlled by the US. Many companies choose .me, .ch, .se, and even .ru, just because they don't want to deal with US violence and theft.
Losing your domain is way worse than having a sub optimal (in terms of marketing) domain.

You should never reuse addresses. Most wallets will create a "change address" automatically behind the scenes every time you spend. Once the coins are moved your friend can't be certain if the coins are still yours.

@_date: 2015-03-19 01:06:43


Again, they can't know how much backward the coins are still yours, and they would also need to know what the addresses involved were about.
For example, if you pay for porn, and then with the change address you buy something at Overstock, and Overstock wants to spy on you, at most they could learn that you paid for porn (and not "all past transactions" like people say), but only if the porn service is using the same address for everyone (which is stupid). Else all they see is a random address with no connection to the real world.

@_date: 2015-03-22 09:03:28
Typically when you move bitcoins, what your wallet does is sign\* a transaction with the corresponding private key for the address where the coins are sitting. When you use multi-signature it's the same, except instead of having only 1 private key, you have many, and a transaction for moving the coins requires certain number of signatures. For example you could create an address with 3 private keys, that requires 2 signatures (a 2-of-3 scheme). Or an address with 5 keys, that requires all 5 (5-of-5). Or any combination you need.
\* as in digital signature:

Addresses in a wallet and their respective private keys can be recovered if you have the seed. So the seed is the only thing you need to back up when using a deterministic wallet, don't worry about the private keys. Wallets will typically ask you "do you have a seed or you want to create a new one?" the first time you open them.

What some merchants do is they pass what they save in fees to their customers. For example, if you say you normally pay 3% with Paypal, maybe you could offer a 3% discount for customers who pay in Bitcoin.
Some other merchants offer even bigger discounts because they also take into account that with Bitcoin they won't be scammed with chargebacks. In this sense Bitcoin is like cash.

Please remember some key points that many writers/speakers get wrong:
- The blockchain can't be separated from the currency. Without a valuable currency rewarding the miners (new coins or coins from fees), there is no hashing power, which means there is no security. A blockchain without a valuable currency is useless because it can be attacked easily.
- Bitcoin is not just a payment system, it's also sound money, a store of value. In fact, I'd say store of value will be (or already is IMO) its best use case. Satoshi has spoken several times about Bitcoin as digital gold. See his thought experiment about an imaginary, boring but scarce metal.
- The blockchain only makes sense for building a decentralized network. It doesn't make sense for a centralized entity like a country to create its own Bitcoin clone, because it would have to create its own mining industry to protect it from other competing or enemy centralized entities. There will be no Fedcoin or UKcoin, unless they are centralized and nothing like Bitcoin.

Well, did the internet die just because it required you to use things like dial-up in the beginning? No, people who accepted the "inconvenience" of hearing weird noises and waiting a little, were rewarded with being able to create websites, send messages and images to the other side of the world, get help with technical stuff (reading entire books about Unix sometimes isn't enough), etc.
Pessimist people from 2100 will look back and compare their new "inconvenient" technologies with our broadband, and wonder how we managed to survive.

Keep in mind is a known Buttcoin troll, and there is *nothing* Bitcoin can do to change his mind. He will cherry-pick and twist the numbers he find to fit his narrative. Even if literally everyone in the world was using it, he would still find something negative to say. In other comment he admitted being scared of new tech.

Don't underestimate stupidity. There are people like ThePiachu who love these coins.

If you think an e-commerce buy order is a smart contract you are simply stupid, there is no other way to put it, sorry.
