The fiat value is unique to every consumer. Could be a $2 car wash. We don’t know how much the original coin was bought for. Yay for adoption!
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:36:26
How are you going to value bitcoin without fiat? lol 
@_date: 2018-09-12 03:10:44
Get back to me when it's 1 Bitcoin = 1 Lambo
@_date: 2018-09-13 02:36:11
Market cap divided by total coins in circulation equals value per coin.
It's not exactly e=mc2 but it's just the way it is. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 19:51:12
Someone one who has already made 100x on their coin would gladly spend it. The receiver is dollar cost averaging 
@_date: 2018-09-10 19:48:16
If the cost of the coin was $1. That’s a pretty good deal on a car wash.

How can I help you understand bitcoin Mr Roubini. It's pretty obvious you just don't get it.
@_date: 2019-11-14 03:14:14
Bitcoin won't replace fiat.
@_date: 2019-11-14 07:05:08
Most transactions have been digital for many years already, way before bitcoin came along. 
Bitcoin facilitates the transfer of value from one person to another. Much like the words in an email. Now however you can attach a $20 bill to that email. Like sending a Christmas card, with the $20 bill in it, to your grandson overseas. Now you can use the bitcoin network instead. 
Bitcoin is not money. It's a protocol to transfer money. If anything bitcoin is more like a timeshare on a really exclusive resort.
@_date: 2019-11-08 20:22:17
That’s really not bitcoin’s fault

Paper money is a government issued, controlled and regulated by laws and a whole bunch of other things I don’t have a clue about. 
If a country creates a digital token/coin it will still be a centralized version of their physical cash. Nothing new. 
Why wouldn’t a country want their chunk of the most finite asset on the planet? But adopt it as a national currency, no. Again this is where laws and regulations need to in place. 
Bitcoin is a digital asset. One doesn’t own “coins”.  The amount of bitcoin coins one owns is just merely a representation of your percentage share of the network which value is determined by current supply and demand. 
Bitcoin is the internet of money. One uses money to purchase bitcoin. Just like you would use money to purchase a vehicle. You wouldn’t then call that vehicle money. However you can sell it for money. You could even “sell” it for bitcoin(an asset). I’d prefer to say trade because it’s like trading a motorcycle(another asset) for the vehicle. Of course you could sell either one for money. Hopefully you come out on top. 
A country would not choose to use motorcycles as currency cuz not everyone rides a bike. Just like bitcoin is an asset one chooses to own or not.
@_date: 2019-10-31 02:22:06
Bitcoin stands alone and will not replace any fiat currency. It's a means of storing value and peer to peer sending of value. Thats it.
@_date: 2019-08-10 19:34:50
@_date: 2019-08-10 01:25:45
Yikes indeed. Ownership is control.
@_date: 2019-08-09 01:25:47
If you don’t control the private keys to the wallet holding your bitcoin, you don’t “own” bitcoin. 
At any moment coinbase can be hacked or just disappear.
@_date: 2019-10-24 00:57:56

What if I didn't want to sell anything, or perform a service. I just want some bitcoin. 
Bitcoin acts like currency, but it is not currency. Acts like gold, but it is definitely not gold either. Unlike regulated government money, bitcoin is a completely uncorrelated asset.

Just how crazy are we talking? I need some clarification here. 
What would be so epic that all the governments around the world decide to condemn themselves and everyone on the planet back to the Industrial Age?
@_date: 2019-12-07 20:31:19
Bitcoin will not replace fiat currency.
@_date: 2019-12-08 19:48:30
Why would I give you bitcoin for bitcoin? Or money for money? 
Money is a regulated government unit of account. bitcoin is a means of value transfer.

Bitcoin is way better than money
@_date: 2019-12-09 03:25:49
The idea is that one should cost average into bitcoin, if you're in the green by a large margin then by all means paying pennies on the dollar is a great move in anyone's books. If however you are not positioned to do this then the risk is obviously present to lose out on the deal.
Good luck and enjoy the wedding.

Where does the employer get the bitcoin to pay the employee?
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:54:06
Bitcoin facilitates the transfer of value. The term currency is a complete misnomer. One can turn bitcoin into currency all day long.
Bitcoin allows two people to transact with each other regardless of region and without an intermediary in a digital world just like cash. It's the evolution of transacting.  There are inherent risks that come with owning bitcoin. Much like riding a motorcycle. it's not for everyone.
@_date: 2019-12-09 05:05:10

By buying at multiple times during the month(as I do myself), you're buying when the coin is in the red, hopefully catching it on a pullback/new low(lol). This is dollar cost averaging. The platform is personal preference, factor in the fees and spend what you want. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 19:31:37
This was great! I want stamp!!
@_date: 2018-11-29 05:37:05
If you remove fiat from the equation, how will you know how much your bitcoin is worth? 
Market Cap/Coin Supply = Value of coin. 
Now don't get all bent out of shape saying I'm not looking forward enough. Your opinion is not going to affect the equation in anyway. Bitcoin is the alpha predator make no mistake. (IMO)
@_date: 2018-11-04 23:30:23
