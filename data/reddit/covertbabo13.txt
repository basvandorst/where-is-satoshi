Yes, the IRS collection of taxes. If that were to cease, USD would equal zero.

But why do you want Bitcoin? To enjoy it personally by yourself, or to pawn off later to another person.

So, I remember around New Year's Eve 2018 people here were saying HODL, and their moms were baking pies in the shape of bitcoin.
However, in reality their wealth has plummeted 85% and their hair is starting to go gray.

A commodity has to serve a purpose, like Orange Juice can be drunk for example. But bitcoin is useless on its own.
The reason it sells is to resell to Greater Fool.

Yes but the reason she was able to exchange bitcoin, is that some Suckers still exist who hope bitcoin will moon.
If they knew the dream was over, they would decline bitcoin.
Would you get paid in something that drops 80%?
You use current market price as proof, but think about a Nigerian scam. Some sucker pays $10000 so Nigerian scams are valuable?

Bitcoin has no value whatsoever. Find another job, now that this get-rich idea has turned out to be a fake.

Red pill: this isn't a dip, but a 10-year forward high.

It can transfer bitcoin, but that is not valuable.

You can't leave out the most important part.
For instance, if someone suggested a easy way to cut down trees, and that was: Sitting and home. That would be a faulty solution, because Yes it's easier but the trees aren't being cut,
Similarly bitcoin may be convenient but it's worthless. So it isn't money.

100 dollars absolves 100 dollars US tax debt.
1 dollar extinguishes 1 dollar tax debt.
21 million bitcoins resolve 0 cents tax debt.

Yes. There is basically 2 types of money, one is driven by Taxes and called fiat, and the other is Commodity money driven by intrinsic value.
But the crypto community had the wrong idea that money was driven by simple "habit." So, they said let's make a new habit called bitcoin.
But actually it turns out bitcoin is neither Tax nor Intrinsic driven; and it is completely worthless.
@_date: 2018-08-07 15:52:51
If you leave out the Defining feature, then all of the rest collapses.
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, and therefore isn't money.
It would be like someone saying: "I can resurrect your grandmother." -"How?" "By making a sandwich. I can name you 10 good things why sandwiches are good."
@_date: 2018-08-08 08:05:30
The key question is, can you earn enough money. If your income is 1 billion dollars, then it doesn't matter that 1 dollar has lost value.
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:26:06
So you plan to spend your entire life bagholding this dog
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:44:41
Chapter 1 We misunderstood how money works so we created a worthless coin. The End.

Intrinsic value means you have direct use for something. Let's say you own a fantastic mansion, and you want to sell it. For some reason, there are no buyers. Do you now decide to burn down the house? No, because despite having no market value (extrinsic), you personally can still use the mansion, and therefore it has intrinsic value.
However there is nothing to actually do with a bitcoin, such as enjoy it personally yourself without selling it.
@_date: 2018-08-08 03:14:13
It does, it can do some function such as provide nourishment.
Even something with low value like Expired Tube of Medication can be used to throw at loud car alarms or something. Bitcoin can't.
@_date: 2018-08-08 04:12:17
I understand bitcoin currently fetches 6600 dollars, but that is ONLY because buyers have been told they will be able to unload to a greater fool.
Once everyone starts realizing that Moon is a myth, the value goes back to direct usefulness of bitcoin which is zip.
@_date: 2018-08-07 16:19:23
It not only accepts dollar, it only accepts dollar.
So fiats are worth something after all, while bitcoin isn't.

You can safely assume that Other Hungry Actors exist out there, so yes.

If you put 1 cent in one hand, and 21 million BTC in the other, then 1 cent will outweigh them.
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:02:49
5000 is still a tremendous amount of money.
The only appeal of bitcoin was that you could load up 100,000 coins at 00.01 dollars and then wait a few years and unload as a billionaire.
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:11:51
Bitcoin is going sub 1 dollar.
Just lol at those who think 1000 is low. 1000 dollars is a shitton more useful than some load of nothing.
