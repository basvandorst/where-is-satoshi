Well i do understand it. Believe me im not against bitcoin if i get rich i take 30 mortgages to invest in it any time. But im on the poor side thats my problem! Oh yeah trust me YOU WILL PAY BOB eventually�� you have to be really naive. Im shocked.

Bitcoin with lightning system is actually worst than federal reserve, empowers the rich and maintain the poor undercontroll. Its a system like visa got but with steroids.
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:49:17
There is two networks. The one currently going now and the one that is lightning in the future. the one currently going is the one you cant afford, but rich people dont mind use, the one that is private. If lightning has the features said, it might have a middle man to guarantee that your money wont get stuck and you have acess to everything you want by using the closest most efficient path possible, if the process goes random its more likely the network to be inefficient.(it will make long paths progressively).

Want to pay to open 20 payment channels For 20diferent services? What if i told you that for a small fee you pay me only one channel to acess all your 20services and more?i can even offer you discounts for services we provide on the first year as special deal to choose me humm?? You got only keep a small amount in your channel as bare minimum we have more than thounsands clients (not because they had any choise, other choises are just too expensive) but!! We do great deals!you should thank me your money wont get stuck in lanes ever you pay very few and make me millionaire in the process. Then i transfere the money any where in the world without any control by any other millionaire cause ill be so rich that paying 20+ in fees its not even a problem. I love LN✌����������������
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:34:57
Man explain to me how can you not see it?? Im really confused!!! Who in their right mind would agree with a system where rich get the best network and you get this payment channels that any rich guy with 2 fingers of forehead can manipulate!! How we got in here?!
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:04:25
A small question isnt a finite amount of coins in a capitalist system a problem? I mean the system makes some people literally own big amounts increasing the gap between rich and poor,the rich will own a lot of power since they literally control the flow that goes around the network. What does actually fight that?
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:17:47
Am i the only one who is seeing a problem here?
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:16:46
I dont remember ever mention im bitcoin cash side. Youre the one with bitcoin gods here, if you know how the network operates you know they know the answer to "how to scale the network" the whole centralization thing becomes subjective till certain point. Youre the one that is not seeing the problem here, if you think all other coins are just waitting for a problem like bitcoin to show up youre wrong! Ifyou think that bitcoin simply moves foward and other coins just wait looking youre wrong! Diference? They already passed that fase of the fees/transaction times, bitcoin core its just stuck with things that are not working! But this is all subjective. You can argue about the market cap diference but you dont know if other coins cant handle (dont act like god you dont) but one thing we both know, bitcoin CANT.
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:27:22
Well i can call bitcoin a scam too since its not even a good competitor of the market, developers know its shit but they keep feeding of the brand name, make promises. With a well elaborate speech about improving the network(which they have no idea how), fees just get bad, transactions time even worst. And before people realize that there is actually working busineses on crypto beyond bitcoin its too late. But you got to pump that bitcoi. There is people stuck on 19k. Now downvote me for talking shit about your coin while you guys talk shit about others.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:23:46
They say they work with banks and explain openly how the coin works. How is that a scam? Puting things the way it is on this post it sounds like a scam but that's no diferent then the way i put things about bitcoin on my post to sound like a scam.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:13:52
Nope i actually dont have all the wisdom thats why i discuss things With all parties, and i realize bitcoin is very weird. I really try to understand it but it claims one thing and is actually another if youre rich, well then youre just fine, good for you ,dont worry about it but i have to��.
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:17:15
Visa * network
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:31:55
After this interview i realize finally the people that are talking here. This is a business man vs an academic arguing about things that are both right. Im gonna be honest if i was competition from these two with a new coin i would get that network solution as fast as i can and i would wreck this two because because they both are clearly stuck in useless arguement. and yes both are right this is just proud and human stupidity working here but hey its good to get your millions right?!
Edit: many people dont realize both strategies dont oppose each other they actually complement each other for the best Solution.
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:01:13
If you have to ask that its because youre also on the wrong side and you should be worry. Think of it as if youre a guy with a lot of money! How can you pull off money out this system? In the video example(check the video) bob is your friend but i see bob as a corporation guy with millions of "friends" that need him to open a channel to acess millions of services, you pay bob because you just need to open a channel with him? Get it?! Rich people dont care if they pay high fees on the network remember that mainnetwork that is too expensive to use thats why there is lightining? Yeah they can just use it without middleman and that is some serious money going on unregulated.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:24:43
So its centralized coin now? Good thing we clear that out.
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:22:32
I like how you say "its only cheaper and faster" as if it doesn't matter that much. And bitcoin cash for that matter its the cheapest and faster of ALL competition. bitcoin is ONLY behind ALL competition (ethereum ripple litecoin) its ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:39:29
So with this in mind i can start a business where i keep all other bitcoin people?  I own the payment channels of certain services and so because you dont want to pay a channel everytime you need a diferent service people come to me to acess all services at discount fees? Can i do that?
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:06:48
How am i supose to believe in bitcoin if even if i wanted i cant use it? Explain me this plz...
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:30:52
Youre projecting man. Common throw your argument, show me what you got, dont come say im stupid and pretend to be an expert by talking down on others.(exactly what you just did projecting)
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:27:42
There is no inflation so they can just sit around and let the busineses suck more coins, till the point that the coin gonna get so rare that they can just buy anything. He can have a fortune and pay your work for very cheap because the price of the coin goes up since there is very few around, gather a club of few rich people and they control this system at will.
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:58:20
Go inform yourself many cryptos offer Security (and claiming best security is very debatable) and anonymity (some dont by choise but there is better service if you want this). It is in fact the most liquid asset but by speculation (seriouly its not the best service in the market and saying "not the best" is being very nice 5min research you conclude that ). The least volatile that must be a joke or you probably never saw markets before.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:32:06
If i want to store value i would buy stocks or bonds With working profit busineses. If someone sell me a coin to buy things, i want to buy things with it, but not by decreasing my buying power to fees otherwise i just keep fiat. Or i just get a cheaper coin to work with, i dont get this religion around bitcoin do people actually buy things with it or are they just speculating?
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:39:28
What best money? You know its slow right?  You know you have More buying power with other coins right? Best on what? Explain!!!
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:42:54
Yes in crypto bitcoin is the most volatile. But you can say by the almost whole market because thats how insane it is. Its funny because so much hashing power it still has bad transaction fees?! Oh thats right hashing power doesnt matter if you cant actually use it. The developers argument is a good one i really need to talk to those developers i want to know how they sell something 20x more expensive than competition and still be in the game, im opening a business i also need to influence masses.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:51:41
Downvoted me or shadow ban me for saying the true. Bitcoin is far from competing many cryptos have a transaction fee of &gt;1$ and there is people believing in a service with +20$ 20 to 40 TIMES MORE if i told this to myself back in 2011 past me would call me liar. BITCOIN seriouly how you get masses to do this i want to open a business too.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:54:53
Any investor should be aware of market manipulations, inform yourself as best as you can and make a decision. Even if its wrong one  you had your reasons, noone is 100% right all time.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:13:05
��Do the math��to secure the network reliability ��you need somebody to ��have money avaible��100%��as specialized service��. Then why they say "opening a channel with someone" if in reality youre paying to acess a network? And i thought you had to give permission to allow people to use you as a gateway to the channels you have. And in theory you still need someone with a lot of channels open or everyone just gonna open one channel?! And hope someone else give acess to your services?! The routes would be very inefficient that way, unless they have others components the way you say doesnt work no wonder it keeps being delayed.
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:04:02
Wait you mean you buy things with bitcoin? I thought it is just store of value and speculation?!
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:17:30
Be more elaborate or youre just saying nonsense.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:00:57
Why the best developers? Just because someone on internet told you? Did you know that there is a solution that scales as technology improves?!  Did you know that your rockstar developers apparently Dont find this solution attractive enough? But other cryptos are implementing and guess what? Bitcoin is falling behind and now is trying to prove with other solutions only to not swallow the toad that they were wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:56:36
Thats 90%of bitcoin community. They are all either billionaires or never made bitcoin transactions in their life. Cause to be honest i dont see the product on this...
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:07:59
Im downvoted despite me making legit arguments which in true noone got a counter answer. Spend a little time search todays bitcoin, doesnt make sense as a service unless youre a millionaire. You say long term bitcoin will find solutions, so as the other coins will, so what ?! That means you can have a bad service today? In case you didnt notice all other coins got their solutions by now bitcoin is stuck in problem that other coins dont have, by now others coins are moving on tackling other problems. See the problem here?!
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:02:41
Then they come talking about drama, i cant even discuss anything, an actual normal conversation to understand what holds bitcoin. Because it doesnt take long to see something off and you dont know why is even this way.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:50:45
Yeah i feel like LN is a temporary solution and im still unsure about his effectiveness in the blockchain, im waiting to see the results of the whole segwit2x and LN thing. You have an opinion about them?
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:31:46
 
Transaction fees is a statement of fact you can prove yourself.
 Average transactions  fees of all 4coins. You know why you only see bitcoin chart? Because its so high that there is no way to represent them all.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:11:36
Its not drama, which part people dont understand that 20+ dolar as transaction fees DONT MAKE SENSE its not bitcoin cash but 3 other competitors do better than that we are talking about cents vs +20dollars! Why bitcoin still matters? It made people millionaire in the stockmarket thats why and people want more of that and are trying to push his price, even if TODAY is the worst crypto of all.
