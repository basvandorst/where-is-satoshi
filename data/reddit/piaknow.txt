Yeah it seems like a glitch or something. Like the price switched with eth briefly. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:05:45
Completely false 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:24:23
So do you agree that it would be bad for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:38:15
Yes it's been down all day. Totally offline for almost 2 hours.

You and most people who don't want net neutrality don't understand the history. Obama did not create it 1 year ago. It was a problem before, and rules were made accordingly.
"In December 2006, the AT&amp;T/Bell South merger agreement defined net neutrality as an agreement on the part of the broadband provider: 'not to provide or to sell to Internet content, application or service providers ... any service that privileges, degrades or prioritizes any (data) packet transmitted over AT&amp;T/BellSouth's wireline broadband Internet access service based on its source, ownership or destination.'"

Speak for yourself! I had Google and Century Link on my street and on my property for 2 months last summer.

So essentially, your ISP's can choke or ban major exchanges. This doesn't make it impossible to trade, but it will be out of reach for a large section of the community that lack in depth computer knowledge. I can't see it not damaging bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:54:33
That's great! I hope I can do the same for my future kids.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:02:10
Of course! Wasn’t calling you out, I was just confused until I read his comment history. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:19:31
Repealing neutrality is good for a very small group of people.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:02:39
This is the best one
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:28:32
Ok, I couldn't tell.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:22:18
You don't think that throttling or banning exchanges will drive the price of BTC down? I don't want to be at the mercy of my ISP on whether I can trade or not.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:25:05
Does it buy automatically at a certain price?

You misunderstand what the internet is and how it works. U/IIIBlackhartIII gave a great explanation for the technical reasons having hundreds of ISP's is impractical.
"The other companies would end up having to use each other's roads at one point or another, it just isn't feasible or sensible for each company to have their roads all on top of each other and around each other, like spaghetti junction, that's not how the internet works. When a packet leaves your system it has to hunt it's way towards its destination. Sometimes the paths are already known, sometimes they're not. The packet jumps from server to server, querying the ones around it as it goes, looking for a server that either knows how to get to the final destination, or has interacted with traffic from that destination and knows what the next closest jump would be. Now imagine that complicated by lots of closed networks all trying to control or circumvent each other's access.
Imagine a city full of roundabouts, and a GPS that's trying to guide you through it to your home. With a single public network it can easily plot a route through the roads and find you a quick and easy path to your house. Now imagine instead that the roadabouts are all randomly owned by different companies, and somehow your GPS has to find a path through all those roundabouts that all belong to the same company, because each company is fighting with the next to try and make their service the best. Even if there's an equal number of companies who own equal amounts of the road, it makes it a mess for everyone involved for the roads to be divided in such a way.
And what if you work on the "Facebook" end of town, but you've got to get to the "Twitter" end of town, and you're a Comcast customer. At some point you're going to hit an intersection and have to choose- either you have to cross the "Timewarner" junction and deal with their 10MPH speed limit, or follow the detour through the backroads with a 5 mile diversion that slows you down just the same."
Also, think about dozens of companies tearing up your city to lay cables. Digging and hanging wire on your private property. It's expensive, invasive, and unnecessary. The libertarian ideal cannot realistically provide a free internet.

How is this any different than investing on wall street? It is volatile, but more secure in the fact that the value in each coin is set by the users, NOT THE FED. There are plenty of middle class people who invest 5 figures in the stock market. The difference is, their dollars are losing value.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:52:40
For every story about a would be bitcoin millionare there are just as many people who have put a lot of money in alt coins, hoping to become millionares that never will be. And thousands of people who invested in "the next ebay" or "the next google" that went nowhere.

You don't think that the retail integration in Asia and soon the US (hopefully) will mitigate that? CME, nasdaq integration? I think it's possible the coin has enough pros in 2018 that the sell offs won't be terrible.
Edit: yo. The downvote is not a disagree button. If you disagree tell me why.

Do you think that repealing net neutrality will not negatively affect bitcoin users? I live in an area with only 2 ISP's - Comcast and Century Link. The likelihood of Coinbase or Gemini paying them off enough to buy equal speeds with no paywall are virtually zero. It will take years and cost millions to get a competitor up and running, and they might not offer equal access either. 
Do you want to be at the mercy of your ISP on whether you can trade crypto?
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:04:48
The 2 year chart certainly makes it look that way.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:59:55
Yup. And possibly 5.5
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:38:56
Is it still banned? I thought they lifted it but not positive.

It is, but I agree with others that if we want BTC to increase value and go mainstream we need to show companies that we're willing to buy with BTC. Amazon won't integrate if they know we will HODL to our graves.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:43:30
I think it has more to do with Coinbase outages
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:48:43
Bitcoin is bad for you. The coke is a biproduct.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:24:05
Hard to say. It was at 5K just a couple weeks ago! It will get a lot of mainstream attention now which will increase demand, but it may prompt China or other nations to ban or regulate crypto. China's regulations have heavily influenced dips in the past.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:16:37
I think something really big would need to happen to stop it now. Like world government banning it or coinbase getting hacked or something. It has so much going for it I don’t see why people would stop valuing them for no reason. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:57:42
Yes a dip would be the best thing that could happen in the next week
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:25:35
So it needs to be used as a currency instead of an investment
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:38:00
It was 5K in the middle of November lol.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:56:02
Keep in mind, bitcoin is an international currency. The wall is only relevant to Americans, which account for a small fraction of owners and miners. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:58:53
Take yo sip, do yo dip! 
I should make a Bruno mars gif for the dip
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:42:46
Sorry for your loss but I'm grateful to live in a progressive country where you can marry your BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:47:54
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:16:47
Makes sense. What do you think could make it more stable? Is stability realistic for the 1-4 year time frame?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:35:29
Really? Why would that bring price down?
@_date: 2018-03-13 03:09:21
No, you’re totally right, but when you first read the word ‘hodl’ how did you pronounce it? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:37:55
As long as the stock market keeps dipping we’re not going anywhere 
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:42:16
Yeah but he pronounced it hoe-dl
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:27:36
Was the BTC crash a canary in the coal mine for the stock market dip?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:56:54
So much for that post predicting 16K by October. Remember this any time someone claims to know what the price will be.
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:34:46
Or 7.5K haha. But that’s what I’m hoping for because I sold everything at about 11K last month.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:34:55
I highly doubt that. I’d bet a good sum that BTC will rise again when the stock market does. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:34:53
As long as the stock market keeps tanking I think BTC will keep crashing 
@_date: 2018-12-02 02:56:48
Right. So the story is, hedge funds and other institutions pumped and dumped last year, and now they are shorting paper and buying physical to pump and dump again? I think we're giving them too much credit. For this to happen on a large scale, anyway.
