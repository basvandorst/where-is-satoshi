You made my day
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:45:41
One can dream though..
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:45:18
Care to explain more that statement?
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:22:54
point is: buy low and hodl more. BTC is going to skyrocket during the coming financial bubble, just like other safe heaven assets
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:46:20
I totally agree

How do you think segwit implementation will affect BTC price next week?
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:54:40
Hahahah changing times!
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:40:20
His arguments are simple: 1)BTC has no fundamental value 2) it is a giant Ponzi scheme thus calling it "fool's gold" 3) it doesn't have a purpose. I have my opinion about him but the purpose of the post is to find out the community's opinion of him
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:56:33
That's irrelevant my friend

couldn't agree more, some say that RSI indicator should not be used as an identifier of bottoms rather as a confirmation for the current price movement. I disagree and believe that the best time to accumulate is when it hits 20's- low 30's in weekly and 40s in monthly, we 're getting there
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:10:05
2.81x and rising ;) hahahaha say hello to the dumpening of BCH
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:12:40
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:54:44
did u sell?
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:30:13
people should be educated to start using segwit exchanges/wallets and stop bitchin and whining about high trans fees
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:51:39
of course! sit tight mate
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:00:46
because u haven't activated a segwit address 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:25:04
start buying btc again ;)
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:59:07
drop might extend to low 5000's but it's healthy, don't be scared. everything else is FUD
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:18:59
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:31:47
i don't think that core developers are siting right there watching with their hand crossed right now ;)
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:56:32
fees are way over the roof right now but you gotta acknowledge that you pay the same 10$ for 1500$ or more transaction
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:53:02
so as satoshi nakamoto said, the miners showed the true chain
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:00:08
leave the rest in btc and sit tight
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:29:29

@_date: 2017-11-12 23:39:25
proof of spam attack right?
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:48:23
good point
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:24:13
mate that's our plan as hodlers, i want to hear the developers plan though
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:26:05
hahahha let 'em throw it to 4.5K, more for us
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:45:24
volume is good, but... good enough?
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:04:56
there's no such concept as "resistant from miners". as if miners will be buying to keep btc above 6k? lol
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:27:48
For the time being..
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:54:19
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:03:41
Head and shoulders forming?
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:26:21
let's hope for a double bottom or short of a reversal pattern
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:47:54
guys the more hateful/FUD posts you see from bitter people that sold @ a loss and/or no coiners, the closer we are to the bottom of this crash. keep calm, hodl on and buy cheap btc ;)
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:23:33
means that the underlying trend (up/down) loses steam and fades
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:54:36
Where do you see it bottom out finally? my guess 2-3K midterm and then accumulation period before next run
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:17:30
first time. thanks for your substantial contribution.
@_date: 2017-09-10 13:57:38
heard so, maybe spread in more than 1 addresses
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:40:40
cause FUD
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:30:36
what about them? hadn't they panic sold they wouldn't have lost a dime
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:22:15
what you are referring to is technical analysis.
Fundamentals are:
1)Fees going down due to batching of txs and segwit adoption 
2)LN network progress
3)Btc reaching steadily more people and "matures"
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:03:27
Maybe, unlikely though. Enjoy the ride anyway

o not go gentle into that good night, 
Old age should burn and rave at close of day; 
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Though wise men at their end know dark is right, 
Because their words had forked no lightning they 
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright 
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, 
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, 
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, 
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight 
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, 
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
And you, my father, there on the sad height, 
Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray. 
Do not go gentle into that good night. 
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Guys what's our ceiling pricewise so as to halt the downtrend?
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:46:31
thanks for responding, and for the long post, i was actually referring to the transaction fees after the segwit implementation
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:30:36

@_date: 2017-09-09 18:51:26
1) Read it 
2) Understand it
3) Apply it to your charts
4) Make money
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:36:01
Probably floor around 4k +/- 1k
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:53:44
in monthly too!

If he's not trolling then he's mental. You don't lose any money if you don't panic sell! When blood's on the Street it's time to buy not sell

Technical patterns emerge from average investor's sentiments of fear and greed and are not bound solely to a certain class of assets
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:40:21
news flash: another burst bubble burst this weekend
