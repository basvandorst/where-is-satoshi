I'd recommend buying Linden Dollars from Second Life, transferring them to VirWox and buying BTC with the SSL. 
It'll take 24+ hours to withdraw BTC from VirWox for the first time.

I would honestly be incredibly surprised.

Set up an account on VirWox. Next, set up an account on a (?game?) called Second Life. Good, now buy the amount of money you want in BTC in Linden Dollars (SLL). Transfer the SLL to VirWox and place a btc/sll trade for bitcoins. 
This is how I trade USD from PayPal to Bitcoins.

Just a note for OP: You only need to wait the 24 hours to withdraw bitcoins from the VirWox account to a wallet. So you don't need to worry about Bitcoins going up while you wait.

I bought two whole bitcoins at $120. Already starting to bounce back.

Once your bank has a partnership with an Exchange, would you possibly offer that kind of service? Exchanging the Bitcoin at the current market price and funding your card 'instantly'?

I hope this is the case.

I'm actually excited about this. I've been hoping for something like this to happen. :D Weeee! :D
