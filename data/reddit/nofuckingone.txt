Hmm... Right...
@_date: 2016-08-09 21:22:37
I guess you should take your coins outta there

Electrum lets you choose your fee

Steam game and phone credits.

I don't know how people can be so dumb, if you find some gold don't tell the world,  just shut the fuck up.

I'll try restoring from another computer with Windows, I'll keep you updated.

Wtf, I said I'm not using coinbase
@_date: 2016-11-09 11:34:05
Free money doesn't exist.
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:00:22
I never had problems with Coinbase but I'm glad I moved to Electrum.

I tried on Windows and it worked, I will try an older version on Linux and see what happens. Thanks for the help
@_date: 2016-12-06 12:03:17
That's alarming

Just learn to trade forex, there are resources online and it's the exact same thing but with bitcoin instead of the usual currencies

This reminds me of a company selling likes on Facebook

Never used it but I would love to be able to buy electronics like graphics cards with btc

Look up Fortune Jack
@_date: 2016-09-27 13:01:09
Lol didn't notice

They couldn't have chosen worse actors.
@_date: 2016-10-23 00:41:13
That's a good question but I don't know  people are downvoting you. Every time there is a newb question it seems to be immediately downvoted.
@_date: 2016-10-03 20:08:35
No, it won't damage the performance of your parts but it will reduce their life span. Like the others said, it's not worth it.

My first purchase with bitcoin was a game on Steam
@_date: 2016-07-23 04:46:11
