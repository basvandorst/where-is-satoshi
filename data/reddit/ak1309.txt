Crisis is on 16th kid, lol
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:24:57
Don’t be so quick boy lol
Could also be remembered as the second biggest dip since 2013 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:15:22
Good point
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:46:52
What if I tell you BTC is in negative correlation with XRP and ETH lately and ETH correlates with XRP big time.. 
Are they getting ready for something? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:32:30
Be ready for $4,000-$4,500 dip
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:48:35
Kill it before it lays eggs 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:25:24
Yes it does matter, I won’t buy something overbought and I won’t sell something oversold! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:19:53
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, simple. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:49:08

@_date: 2017-11-02 12:28:17
As long as you learn from your mistake. Yes it goes up over time but why would you waste your money that you can use wisely? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:28:32
People can shit talk technical analysis, but I see it going to $8,200 then dropping to $4,500 and from there to 10K. 
Nice to see similar numbers! 
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:11:27
This guy ain’t bout that life lmao
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:22:36

@_date: 2017-10-07 20:33:50

@_date: 2017-10-07 20:27:56
Yeah I am aware of it bro, I wasn't posting it here until the first upswing was complete so you guys just press play and see it live
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:55:33
YOU CRUEL MONSTER! STOPPPPP
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:05:27
 I cannot take the credit for the meme, but I can definitely take it for referring to cryptoruble lol
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:04:11
"I just paint parabolic graphs" 
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:49:37

4/20 
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:15:58
He is not your friend bro
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:39:10
Plus you can't even mine it
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:20:00
You got it wrong buddy, it’s not laughing at Putin’s Russia but reminding everyone that it is against our ideas of decentralized system
@_date: 2017-10-07 21:49:32
I mean we are here for long ;) hodl
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:13:57
Let’s see, it depends
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:50:52
They were shorting Bitcoin at $3500 
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:08:05
I mostly meant your friends that you roast at now haha
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:44:18
That's the cryptoruble idea for me, not Russia.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:01:25
I'm your long last cousin! 
@_date: 2017-10-07 21:49:17
Agreed, well smart people shouldn't be worried because we want to use it in future, not exchange it back to fiat... 
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:56:36
Нахуй крипторубль! :) 
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:54:30
Exactly, they are going to make people buy other coins only via cryptoruble 
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:13:09
I don't think it will last long, but let's see
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:48:05
I didn't make it but I couldn't find any better time to share this bro! 
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:13:44
Thank you, if I don’t see a clear break of 6,200 and upwsing higher, then it will resist from there
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:19:03
Right about now my friend, not even kidding lol
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:37:41
The idea behind is "we will try to fuck everything up before it even started".. I think they started too early and they will fuck up and go with Ethereum eventually.. My opinion. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:45:58
Sberbank is already partnering with Ethereum
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:49:46
Fookin weasel! 
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:04:04
What you think about it now bro?(;
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:45:02
Resistance is ahead tho, be aware;) 
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:34:39
