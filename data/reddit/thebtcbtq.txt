You are correct. In terms of cryptocurrency fungibility, think of Bitcoin as gold, Ethereum as oil, Litecoin as diamonds, and altcoins as fiat.

Bisq is an underrated, but awesome exchange. More traders should use it.

The analogy is that Bitcoin is the oldest, most stable cryptocurrency. Ethereum is  and Litecoin is  Altcoins are the newest and most volatile cryptocurrency. Sorry the analogy was unclear.

Considering his involvement with PayPal, it's a conflict of interest for his brand image to openly support a technology that could make his previous venture seem obsolete.

It should. University students can buy into ICOs or air drops freshman year. By senior year the coins could moon and pay off tuition in full. Hey, how about College Coin? The coin that pays your college!

This is how marketing is done these days. Pay someone to spread viral hype or fud on social media.

Both markets would moon. Even a 1% market adoption would be amazing.

We re-sell our own bitcoin and ethereum for a markup. Easy checkout without the hassles of Coinbase. Business has been going well, but Stripe does not want to deal with "digital" currencies. The crazy part about this is my PayPal/eBay accounts were closed earlier this year for the same reason. That's why I went to Stripe in the first place.

I'm saying Elon is crafty with his PR. You guys are saying his tweets are gospel. Both scenarios are ok.

Do not sell, unless it's for another cryptocurrency.

I agree. I am a bitcoin friendly real estate broker and it's exciting to see advancements like this in an industry that is technologically antiquated.

Do you guys (r/bitcoin) really expect him to come out and say what you *really* want him to say..."Use Bitcoin, PayPal is terrible!" No, he's not going to say that. Every time crypto is mentioned he's going to brush off the topic to discuss Tesla, Solar City, and SpaceExiting to his next venture. I'd bet him .25 BTC that he actually has significantly more than .25 BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:00:48
That's why I wrote previous.
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:00:24
Exactly. And he definitely gave his friend Elon more than .25 BTC back in the day.
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:49:49
He owns no crypto? Poker face.

ICOs are risky, but what other investment class is returning 10x-30x annually with little to no barrier to entry?
