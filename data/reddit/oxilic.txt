That's where he went wrong.

I don't think they added the 1% fee yet.  Wasn't it delayed or something?

I won't include the source here, but it is a 10 line python code that just pulls the data from the sqllite database and decrypts it using an api. 
With Firefox, you can encrypt them using a master password.  IE 10 is pretty easy too as they pretty much added an api to retrieve the password, while older versions encrypted the saved passwords with the url.  The password could still be decrypted by going through the users history though.
Although I agree that once the file is already installed the user has long lost as it could be keylogged, it would be way easier to pull the data from the browser.  Most people would give up trying to get some random person's password if they needed to go through a huge text file and find it.

Yes, you can withdraw it from ChangeTip to your desktop wallet or tip other people with it.

He never said it was unhackable though, he just said it's statistically unlikely for you to lose your coins.

It doesn't seem to be the actual store though, it's only used to list the products and I don't see a problem with a centralized site listing it as long as you don't use it for actual purchases.

I thing you are confusing it with the Open Bazaar project?

You aren't required to pay to enter it, so it's not a lottery.

Try solving it looking at a mirror.

I don't think moolah donated anything to the Jamaican team, and he payed for 1/3 of the dogecar ($20k at the time IIRC).
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:20:02
It wasn't very popular though.

You need to port forward the port 12345 for it to connect to other nodes.

It is easiest web browser to get the saved passwords from though.

I believe transactions work normally, but miners are inefficient as there is a 6 minutes delay.

Would someone be able to find out where it went if 1 BTC from address A appears in address B by monitoring the exact value sent in the blockchain?

What do you mean by that?  Is it updated every few minutes?  Also, it doesn't seem like the pause button works to stop downloading a site. Is there a way to delete a site from the homepage?
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:32:44
Do we need to forward that port to be able to use it?

There are 2^160 possible addresses. If Visa processes 300m transactions a day, it would take ^^^^13337911360537558003227787658829870131 years to run out of addresses. That is ^^^^966515315980982464002013598 times bigger than the universe's current age.  You can't store all of the addresses with current technology, even if you somehow managed to generate all of them, so we're pretty safe from running out.
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:54:37
Tried to log out and log back in but that didn't work.  It seems like the issue is with Firefox as I tried it with chrome and it worked.
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:09:16


It can't currently because there is a limit of 1MB per block, which is around 4 transactions a second or 350k transactions a day. It will get bigger, so that shouldn't be a problem.  


Confirmations don't cost money.  Transactions do have a fee though to prioritize it so it will be included in the first block.  


That's only if you're waiting for 6 confirmations. You can accept transactions with 0 confirmations for every-day purchases.

I connected it and it isn't working.  It seems like the preview button isn't enabled.

No, bitcoin is decentralized and we mustn't change that. A dev fee would imply there is an official development group who can force changes on bitcoin.

Can't the tumbler keep logs?
@_date: 2015-03-13 01:26:32
The chances of an address with a typo being accepted are around 1 in 4.29 billions, meaning they will most likely not be sent and you will keep your bitcoins.
