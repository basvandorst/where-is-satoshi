Buy $50k worth of bitcoins, you will have more coins then a $50k mining rig setups would generate over its lifespan. See this link:

Yes, you are bonkers. If you are in UK you will never recover your costs, price of electricity in this country is ridiculous.  
I was lucky to break even in just over a month on my rig, but this was some 3 months ago and the way things are going with the market, it doesn't looks to be getting better.  
You would be better off spending 100k on Bitcoins and speculating on their price rather then actual hardware to mine the coins.  
Have a look at some of the Bitcoin profitability calculators and you will soon see.

Mysterious seller cashing out at mtgox, there's a lot of very old generated blocks in there (2009!).

mybitcoin.com is a better service in my opinion.

The fees are stupidly high. Shame really, was looking forward to using this service.

Are you completely crazy or is this just a troll... Bitcoin mining on Nvidia hardware... Seriously? :/  
Elecricity costs are a major factor, don't over look this. Also, where are you going to house said 100 high end machines? Power consumption and keeping the hardware cool is going to require a lot of planning.

Ha! You're not the only one, I hadn't touched an Ubuntu distro since version 6 before I got into mining. Now I'm running the latest version, writing shell scripts to automate my miners and playing with PuTTY 24/7.

Have you checked your bitcoin data directory? The wallet.dat file is stored separate to the client files if you didn't already know

Sorry for the delay, the ifruit app has been pretty unreliable. I got the bitcoin plate (hopefully)

This man knows what he's talking about.
