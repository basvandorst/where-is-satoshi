Remember when everyone was saying it was going to hit US$100 by the end of the month? I think we should hold off on any predictions, if any lessons have been learned.

Knowing a bit of Kiyosaki's background, I'd bet he's pumping and dumping.

How much are you making per hour? In US$, so approximately.

Most webcam/tube sites provide mostly free content. The industry is going through a huge contraction due to the availability of free/pirated porn, this was pointed out in porn star [Lexi Bloom's AMA]( and [elsewhere](


Also, porn's influence on the VHS/Betamax format wars is dubious, and I don't think it had anything to do with the adoption of DVD, or Blu-ray. VHS won because its tapes were 3-hours and Beta's were 1-hour. DVD wasn't involved in a format war and was just vastly better quality than VHS (in addition to storing more content), that the superseding was inevitable, like audio CD's replacing cassettes. Everyone *said* porn would be the deciding factor in Blu-ray vs. HD-DVD. Of course, it was the PS3 which meant that many people had Blu-ray players. But that's still struggled since the spread of online streaming. So porn had little to do with any media formats gaining popularity, and the decline of the industry today means that will probably continue.
