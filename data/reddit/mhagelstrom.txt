Coinbase is more like a Bitcoin bank and not a wallet. So the bitcoins are actually in their possession. If you use a Wallet like Copay, you own the private keys so you are really in possession of your bitcoins.
Don't get me wrong, Coinbase offer a great service to easily buy bitcoin from your bank account, but I would recommend to send them to your own wallet after buying them.

I guess this post I wrote a few weeks ago fits great here:

That is what it usually takes when using a bank account on Coinbase or Circle. If you get verified, you can buy small amounts using credit card instantly.

Sure disintermediation. But does not mean you cant have a better user experience. On paper Bitcoin and the blockchain can do lots of things but if no one builds those services we will never see user adoption. For example, the blockchain can be a great tool to timestamp documents and cryptographically validate it´s content and probably replace notaries reducing costs. But that needs to be build on top of the blockchain to really be a service that can be used by end users.

ok but it not what the community is publicly talking about. Or at least is not what media and blogs are getting from them.

Is this a risk for Bitcoin startups who need to open bank accounts to operate?

Ok Erik, I hear you. But as you may see on this thread there is no real agreement on this topic and is quite foundational to decide on future features or modifications to the protocol. 
My point is that this debate should be at least as important as the block size. Maybe we are on the urgent vs important dilemma here.

you are confusing money printing (or increasing money supply) with inflation (related with prices or with purchasing power of that money) 
@_date: 2016-02-10 14:35:30
Well you have a much more extreme position then. I think we can still have micropayments using the Bitcoin blockchain but not necessarily on the blockchain (for example using lightning or whatever new thing appear). Personally I do not agree with the altcoin for payments use case. I mean Bitcoin = gold, Litecoin = Silver is an old discussion on which market cap have spoken.
@_date: 2016-02-10 13:01:56
Coffee was just an example I meant regular day to day commerce or retail payment. 
I don´t have my mind set yet as I don´t know that much about Lightning and the alternatives but I am not sure if I agree that if Bitcoin get to turn into a bif trx settlement network it will become controlled by big corps. In fact if Lightning or something similar (Roodstock?) becomes mainstream for micropayments, the Bitcoin BLockchain could just as act as the chain holding all those trx together and maintaining them secure.

I agree with you. But why aren´t we discussing the ultimate solution (or if we all agree with that roadmap) with the same kind of passion that we are discussion about block size. In the end I am with you that 2MB or SW are both temporary solutions to give some air and time. But as long as there are people pretending to replace VISA their technical propositions will be thinking on that goal.

not exactly Bitcoin but be polite and don´t bark at me ;)

It would be better as it would eliminate intermediaries and will low transaction costs. For example today if i want to send 50 usd to someone in another country I need a bank or similar to make the transaction and the cost is very high.
Or you could store your virtual money yourself and not in an institution and pay with your cell phone without using a credit card. 
I mean I agree that it wont solve inflation problems but it has several usecases that are valuable.

Maybe at this subreddit. But in real life, people still use fiat, credit cards, banks. Probably most people complain about governments but that doesn't mean that they stop 'living within the system'.
Don't get me wrong, I love bitcoin but I am putting my passion at the side and trying to be rational. Bitcoin needs some work (new tools, usecases, larger ecosystem, better press) to have a larger adoption with regular joes. My fear is that virtual usd could give people some of the benefits in a shorter term and gain that adoption faster.

Decentralisation is one of the main or killer features but not the only one important. Average Joe might not be that worried about anonymity, emission and so on, and would like virtual dollars that they can keep in their cell phones without a 3rd party involved (bank) and be able to send a receive money for free and instantly.
@_date: 2015-03-20 09:38:19
Not banks, but governments or central banks. And like it or not people today uses fiat and credit cards and wires.
If they develop something that gives fiat more features, like storing money securely yourself without the need of a bank, the abiliry to send money to anyone for free and instantly,I am not that sure that it will be seen as an another obscure altcoin.

It was a joke, I saw the image and thought it would be funny at this particular subreddit. I am not that thirsty

I guess that the advise to make a profit would be: buy low and sell high.
But to be fair, Buffet's "don't invest on something you don't understand" would probably be wiser.

I am not sure If I understand the question. On the client side, you mean a wallet? Copay is a pretty simple to use wallet that support multisig (they call them shared wallets)
@_date: 2016-07-18 02:17:37
I guess the place to start is on
