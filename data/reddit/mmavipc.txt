Your L4D2 folder contains game + custom content you've downloaded from servers. DCUO is now the biggest I've seen at 20gb

dual-boot? have your windows partiton small as possible and then install ext3 drivers(or w/e filesystem you use) so you can use your main partiton for storage while you play games?
