I mean when you want to be involved in an unregulated currency there is technically no such thing as insider trading. With bitcoin there are no rules to dictate the exchanges, as far as bitcoin is concerned insider trading doesn't exist.

I personally think its time to jump ship and move to a coin like ripple especially with the risk of being burned all the time by shit like Mt. Gox and Coinbase manipulating markets, it's just gonna happen over and over until it becomes regulated to think otherwise is foolish.

I moved all of my investments from bitcoin to ripple because it looks like bitcoin is the myspace of crypto and ripple is facebook; i mean ripple already has Lightning Network and is growing faster than bitcoin ever has.

I think memes about a dead crypto are funny

I mean bitcoin is already dead anyway literally every other form of crypto is a better, faster, cheaper option. All that’s keeping bitcoin alive is pure speculation and everyone is gonna lose hard.

The idea of using bitcoin as currency is cancer. You don’t use crypto to buy things the same way you don’t use stocks you’ve invested in to buy things. I don’t know why everyone keeps talking about crypto as if it will replace fiat for transactions, it won’t. All it’s gonna end up doing is facilitate the flow of money. And if you think the government won’t show up to tax your ass based off of income from a decentralized currency then your just fuckin stupid.
