Would you be able to post your guiminer.log? its in the same folder as the executible. 
Be sure to edit out **your user name and password** they're on the top line.
Also have you setup your workers properly? so for slush's pool my login is snippet and the suffix is gpu so the username in GUIMiner is snippet.gpu
And with your own localhost server have you run bitcoin to ensure you have the latest blocks?

A DDOS attack has to be performed against a single target to be effective, Bitcoin is peer to peer, there's no central server governing difficulty increase.
As for github, I don't entirely understand how it works but couldn't code changes be restricted to certain members? Mailing lists can also have permissions set.
For something like this to be pulled off would require an insane amount of time, effort and money which makes infeasible in my opinion

Look at it this way, there is only a finite amount of gold which is a nessesary component in most electronic goods. The amount of gold mined is going to decrease with time, but as long as there is a market for it people will buy it. 
The same applies to bitcoin. It's a finite resource and the market for it is growing. As long as there is a market for it, it'll have a value
As for the gpu's I don't think it would effect the primary market but it might be making a dent in second hand sales
