In Venezuela there is no company that sells bitcoin, and we have a foreing currency fence, so we are pretty fucked for now
@_date: 2014-09-12 03:48:45
By the butts comments, you can tell a lot of them actually understand the bitcoin technology. That being said, they are annoying trolls fixated with @_date: 2014-03-10 17:41:01

You should send the link to sites like:
They always post free icon sets with credits to the author, Im sure they will love these, plus you'll be promoting both your work and bitcoin!

Unreasonable price and currency controls and confiscation of companies by our shameless corrupted and populist government for the last 15 years have caused this
@_date: 2014-06-23 23:16:58

I think its a good "gateway method" for less tech savy people, they already know how to use it, but if the fees are too high theres also not much reason for them to use it.

By the way, the goverment changed the method to calculate inflation to Fisher instead of Laspeyres just to throw some makeup to the real numbers.

Currently there is a lot of competition in mining,
please take a look at this link (its in the sidebar)
[Will I earn money by mining? - An answer to all newcomers](
@_date: 2014-07-01 23:17:02
With current volatility, this makes little sense.

Venezuelan here, and yes they do 
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:28:11
What do they even do?

This should be an educational facility
@_date: 2014-08-29 00:34:48
This is true.

Venezuela (hint:highest inflation in the continent)
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:00:10
It lets you insert bills (dolar, euro, etc) and sends the BTC to your wallet, by sacanning a QR code that you might have on your phone or printed in a piece of paper, I think this model in particular also lets you go the other way around; BTC to Grannies money.
@_date: 2014-08-28 18:23:40
Venezuelan here, I dont know about the exact number, but inflation is eating us up. The fed is is moderate with inorganic money printing compared to Venezuelas government-controlled central bank.
EDIT: I remember why I dony know the exact number; the central bank decided to not publish any more inflation an other indicators that migth be seen as negative.
@_date: 2014-06-15 22:49:12
Never ever ever.
@_date: 2014-09-12 16:59:16
Care to elaborate?

From Satoshi Nakamoto himself:


You can transport this situation to something other than world leaders, and create intrigue and tension

OP, please consider writing a small review on tripadvisor.com
@_date: 2014-07-15 17:53:05
this one did work for me,
so just for english and the us?
maybe they are taking a sandbox apporach to implement it.
@_date: 2014-06-03 03:03:38
on any particular platform?
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:17:55
They sopossedly showed proof of reserves, I think thats the main reason it gets a lot of praise

Thanks, got the SMS in Venezuela, followed and collected smoothly.
One thing I loved:

Yup, PCI compliance is costly.

Venezuelan here, i have about 40usd in bitcoins, and had to jump trhu hoops to get there from bolivares, theres only a tiny handful of people aware of bitcoin here. 
One sure thing is that the govt will try to block it a criminalize it here
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:09:48
Use [quickcoin]( on facebook, its the easiest way for the non-tech folks
@_date: 2014-06-15 23:03:17
Is there a way to include a section for crow-reviewed or crowd-audited code, for instace for sites like [bitcoinpaperwallet.com]( which claim to use client side javascript.

You dont need to have a local copy of the entire blockchain unless you want to run a full node.
The "standard" bitcoin client tries to do it thoug, I dont know if you can opt out.
