Nah, more like Bitcoin and bitcoin cash are both bad tokens. Outdated. Leave ur bitcoin cash and invest in a more promising coin.
Edit: oh nice, downvote because the truth hit you to hard. We are not old conservative people are we?  Shall we just not use better tech because we have all our money into old tech and want that gain? Is that more important than actually creating something good?
Edit2. Keep downvoting, everything that is not 100% pro BTC will be downvoted. In this sub. Its like how a bad Chineese product gets critizised, they dont like it. We all know there are better coins out than BTC, so why work so hard to keep using film when digital cameras are around, if you catch my drift.

I kinda had the same ideology about economics that you have, I was young and stupid. I was also just as furious and butthurt when debating the topic with people I disagreed with. Take it easy man. I also recomend you talk to educated people, as they will "educate" you on the matter.
@_date: 2018-08-21 04:36:49
Because deflation will not make stuff cheaper. This part with "applies to everyone" is very important. If you think deflation will sustain fix incomes with decreased prizes, ur utterly wrong. You clearly havent spoken to anyone with economic education. They know, and they are not "biased". Countries chose to have a stable low % inflation, not to fuck you over, but because it is encuraging spending. Deflation would just make rich people richer, and not do any of the things you think it will.  It wont "create more wealth" to the poor, it will not creat more purchase power to the poor. You cant just create money out of thin air as it seems you like to think.

No, you're the one who actually dont get it. I see your point, but you still dont account for the fact that inflation and deflation affect everyone. Its like rules that everyone has to obey, which is why you wont gain profit just because of deflation. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 08:46:30
No, how would deflation help?
@_date: 2018-08-11 13:48:09
The funny part is that I always get downvoted to hell when I try to explain it. But yeah, I guess people will understand at some point. I also remember when I was teenager and thought inflation was bad and I didnt understand why we had it. I was so obsessed about how evil banks and governments were. If bitcoin were around back then, I'd probably be doing the same thing "posting theese posts and convince people how good it is to have a currency that only increases in value". Is go around saying how bad fiat is only because $20 is worth less today (and not going into details about wage increase and investment encuragement).

@_date: 2018-08-22 14:33:13
Talk to people, show them our conversation. Everry single expert in ths field wil tell you how it really works. Its not how yoy think it is. You think deflation magically will make things cheaper, but the number on the note has nothing to do with purchase power. Deflation wont help poor people, neither will inflation, it all comes down to how society regulate jobs, welfare and investments. You just read about Venezuela and decided to hate inflation not seing the difference between controlled and uncontrolled inflation. Ofc 7000% inflation is harmfull, but a stable 2-3% is not.

A or B?
Both currencies are 100% alike in how they function. Tho only difference is how many people it is distributed amongst.

@_date: 2018-07-19 16:16:33
Dude, you are making up personal assumptions rather than sticking to facts.  We disagree with each other. You state that deflation will help the poor, but I say it would not make a huge difference. How things work is that more money/wealth will always be benefitial for an investing point of view.  Other incentives are needed to help the poor.

What was wrong by using "pyramid scheme"?
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:35:47
Any change of big measure is bad, people lose faith in the currency. This is also why many people still find it hard to adapt to crypto. A slight change in either direction and predictable outcomes is okay. However, we prefer slight controlled inflation over deflation to encurage spending and investment. This is also what moves the economy forward.
Nothing (nor deflation or inflation) will make money out of thin air, most people know that.  Maybe we need more research to tell if our todays system is good or bad?
Edit: worth to know,  the stronger deflation, the stronger the need to hold.   Why spend today when you get more to morro, and more the day after and so on. This is not rocket science.  
@_date: 2018-07-06 18:26:32

Again, Im not saying that our currency is better than bitcoin. While I think bitcoin with finite tokens is bad, I cant say its gonna work or not. This is still a post about how economics work. And your comment is just using maaany words to say that no one can predict how bitcoin will work in our society. I agree. 
And what have the austrian students predicted about bitcoin? That it has increased in value? I want to know. Because, many people have predicted that.
When it comes to economics, we know alot. You make it sound like there is undiscovered truths that has yet to be revealed when there in fact is not.
@_date: 2018-07-03 00:01:53
Inflation affects poor people way less than rich people. Inagine deflation to rich people with lots of savings and poor people with loans. That is something.
@_date: 2018-07-09 02:15:18
I agree with you on some points. But the fact that people hold, I see it as an impediment to adoption.
Imagine having two currencies.  Both equal in amount of tokens. One which 100.000 people possess (token A) , and one which 100.000.000 people posses (token B). So, as a company, which one would you prioritize to accept as payment? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:14:35
Im talking about the circumstances of everything. The , 1% ROI is good in x % deflation. But thats on paper. What I mean by circumstances of everything is that deflation would not neccesary make investing in general more safe/easier. We are in a competetive marked. Deflation will benefit everyone, thus no one; in the grand sceme of things. 
Edit, I understand perfectly what you say, but you look at it very simple.
@_date: 2018-07-06 18:25:36
Thanks alot for taking time in answering my questions. This is the type of discussions I love.  If its true, I have no problem with bitcoin as a currency. Its gonna be exciting to se among all the cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin will always be the first one, so thats that.

Big currencies in modern world does not need gold to back it up.  Its already trusted. However, gold is used for alot of other reasons. And btw, Bitcoin is a massive waste of energy no matter how you look at it. There are cryptocurrencies out there that are way more energy efficient, so why in the world promote bitcoins energy usage?

@_date: 2018-07-03 14:53:54
Wrong.  You will still have savers and people in debt.  The difference is that people with debt will come out worse and people with lots of money will come out richer.  Deflation is not a way to "increase" the gdp of a country.   Nor is inflation.  Its actually what people produce that gives value to the nation.   Both inflation and deflation is bad if they are high.  But there is no doubt a slight inflation is preferable to slight deflation.   I know you probably dont want to realise it, but it is the truth.
@_date: 2018-07-10 19:06:41
1. Not often, and thats why holders hold, so you are definetly right on that one.
2. You are right, 12.5 new tokens every ~10 minutes, but the largest miners get to keep most of them. However is it enough despite that it can be divided down to many decimals? And even though the largest miners get most it is not unfair at all, as this is an investment done by people who sacrifice fiat. It is however no denying that it can make the distribution umbalanced, but still; not unfair at all.
3.  I also think you are right here, people accept bitcoin as a way to invest in bitcoin without actually having to buy it. (This is imo the best form of investment as it makes the coin "spend-able".  Win/win.
And yes, as much as I hate to admit it, it probably does not help a lot to encurage spending since we are in the hold phase.

Comparing cancer and inflation does not make sense. 
You can also say that to much salt in your food is bad, but it does not change the fact that its something our body needs.
Inflation encurage using money and deflation encurage saving. This is not a fixed answer, but a guidline of consequence.  Its not to say tha deflation would for example stop the economy. But to much of either harms the economy, but which one do you think is worse when talking a bout small changes. Deflation or inflation?

I dont need to know exactly what miners do. The things I need to know to predict how bitcoin would work as a currency is:
1. How many transactions can it process in a second.
2. How suitable is it for daily purchases? Fees? Small transactions?
3. How many tokens/coins are there and how much can it be divided? Will there be a finite amount?
4. How easy is it to use?
5. Can bitcoins problems/challenges be fixed and can it be adjusted to handle mass adoption?
6. Is it secure? Is it private, or do we even need total privacy? If so, how trusted is it?
6. Is it stable?
@_date: 2018-07-10 02:06:16
My point is exactly this.  I would also choose the one being used by most people if there were no difference how they work.  It seems whenever a business accepts bitcoin, everyone feels the hype. This is why I dont like the "hold" mindset. 
 This is a solidarity matter. If everyone except one person sold and spent some of theyre coins, the value would probably increase. The one holding would earn the most despite being the only one who didnt contribute.
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:49:54
Investment of 1% ROI in a 2% inflation would NOT mean that it would be 1% in a deflationary society/currency.  Dude, inflation follows everyone.  You need to look at it from the whole perspective. And starting your argument with "false" and then saying it moves forward by capital investment which I agreed on?
@_date: 2018-07-06 02:49:31

@_date: 2018-07-03 08:57:38
You look at it from only one perspective. And you dont see the other effects of slight inflation.   Yes, inflation affects price, but its not the "number" on the pricetag that matters.  Its how much you have to work to be able to pay for this and that. Do you really think the companies would keep paying you the same 15 dollars an hour if they knew every dollar was worth more? Deflation would decrease the number on your paycheck. And with inflation it would increase. At least in my country wages increase every year. Not saying that makes you richer, but people will always take account for this. (And that is what we are witnessing unless you live in a corrupted 3rd world country). If so, then its not the inflation or deflation that is the problem, but how money is controlled by the govenment.
@_date: 2018-07-06 01:01:03
I hit a neeve there.
@_date: 2018-07-03 09:21:49
And I could post tons of articles proving the opposite. That deflation is bad.  Try to see both inflation and deflation from everyones point of view.  As a rich person, as a poor person, as a company owner, as an employer. If you add everything up, deflation seem to do most harm unless you want an unbalanced economy where rich and poor are split.
@_date: 2018-07-03 06:41:36
And you sound uneducated.
Ofc you cant make value from nothing. And people see inflation as the culprit when talking about being robbed.
And yes, you cant make money out of thin air, but people who want deflation dont understand that "deflation itself" creates value out of thin air. But again, this is not possible. So where does the value increase have its roots? Well, the answer is the low wage workers who hardly earn enough to survive not allowing them to save money but rather have to spend it to pay for living. 
Yeah, deflation rewards savers. Now, do you truly believe this is good looking at it from a poor guys view?  Id enjoy the hell out of deflation, I have lots of savings, but im not stupid and understand the consequences it brings.  Deflation is the recipe for making rich richer and poor poorer.  
@_date: 2018-07-03 08:46:37

What do you call it when inflation goes from 20% to 5%?
Its called deflation.  And it was at that point youre screwed  if you'd taken out a morgage.
And your youtube-video did kinda explain that.
Now, inflation of 20% is never good.  But this suggest that no matter how you look at it, deflation is bad for the poor no matter where the deflation "starts". Being at 0% inflation or at 20% inflation.

@_date: 2018-07-03 15:47:33
Why, I kinda feel great. I take it as case closed. I love debating with people who thinks all banks are evil and gets so affected because they heard about this one country that fucked up theyre currency with massive inflation and now have decided to hate fiat and do all they can to make bitcoin widespread without knowing how many countries actually do great despite the "evil fiat". And ofc, why bitcoin?  Why not something more effective and less powerconsuming?  Something with instant transactions without having to wait? Why not another currency? Why is bitcoin soooo good?  I mean, ofc you want bitcoin to be adopted. You probably put all your moms money into it and you know you're fucked unless bitcoim goes up.
No, I feel sorry for you.
@_date: 2018-07-03 08:22:21
Spending should be motivating regardless. People in general arent stupid. We do actually think a little bit before every purchase.
And if spending only was motivated by real needs, we wouldnt be where we are today technology wise. You dont really need that  fresh car, phone, computer etc. Or why have a house with several bedroms, when you can survive with only one?
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:25:27
Did you even read my comment?  
I actually came up with an argument reminding people to see how deflation affects different people.  
Dude, as if it would be soooo hard to find articles proving deflation is bad. I kinda made a point of not sharing links. Guess you didnt understand that.  
I seems that most if not all bitcoin fans all have one thing in common. They hate/dont trust banks. They get so hung up on the negative aspects of banking that its almost like they cant be educated to learn what banking actually is.  
So rather than posting links to articles that explains why deflation is bad (do a google search: **why deflation is bad**) and you\`ll get tons of results; I\`ll link to this youtube video instead which takes banks into matter. It helps you understand economics and what banks do and why they exist. It also explains that yes, not all banks are/have been trustworthy.

Oh come on, think from a company's poont of view. Companies do alot to save money. If money value kept increasing, the company would try to spend less because earning money is what companies do. One way for the company to save money would be to cut wages. It would be easy for the company to justify a wage cut using excuses like -you are not  payed less, we just take into account that the dollars we pay are worth more!".

And deflation gains more value to the coins. Now, if you are rich and have lots of money, you get rewarded. If you dont see this as a problem, then theres no way I can convince you its bad. 
Im not saying high inflation is good, so spare med the Venezuela crap. Venezuela shows what happened when you inflate the fuck out of the money. Ofc people lose faith in it then.  Just dont use that as the only example of what inflation does.
@_date: 2018-07-03 06:26:06
And you sincerely think deflation would fix the unbalance in wealth distribution?  You mention people with low wages. They often have more dept than welthy people. Can you even imagine the struggle to pay off and ever increasing loan because the "value" of the loan increases.  Ofc high inflation is bad, people loses faith in the money, so stop saying im ignorant and dont know shit. 
Having a deflation would demotivate spending (no matter how you look at it). Now, imagine running a company no one buy stuff from simply because everyone think they can buy more later. 
Deflation slows down economic flow (less transactions), and everyone lose in the long run.

Bitcoin is a chain of ledgers.  It grows everyday. You have a set of keys to look up information to see your own transactions on the blockchain "chain of ledgers".  Everytime you make a transaction you call it out.  Minings is done so you as a single person cant keep adding ledgers to the chain without others having a say.  Mining between thousands of computing units secure the blockchain and its decentralization and so no one can make a transaction without the receiver permitting it. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 23:30:52

Yes, companies can cut wages at any time, but deflation would lead to more cuts.  Salaries that are higher exist because there are skills needed for different types of jobs. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 17:28:47
The investment is based on what product/company you think can return profit. Its not based heavily on deflation or inflation.  The deflation and inflation will just adjust the "number" on the profit you get, and most likely not the "value" of the profit.  And yes, ofc more investment does not guarantee more wealth. But you just cant deny that more wealth is benefitial for investing.

It just is not that simple. The inflation or deflation follows everyone. You need to take a while to think about that. You talk about making a profit when the company you invest in has a net loss. How does that go around? Remember, everyone is affected by value change. You, me, the company, everyone.  You can't present your examplea like this the way you do it. You would still have a dollar if you did not invest. Better than 95 cents. And in an inflationary economy, the same investment would probably get you a little more than $1. But, your purchase power remains (and "this" is what you actually fail to understand). And that is why deflation and inflation dont affect investment as much as you think.

Yes. But you need more than the few. And the more fragmented the distribution of the coins, the more healthy the currency becomes. Whales with 90% of the wealth is not good for any currency.

To help motivate the use of money. No business can run if everyone wants to hold on to theyre funds.

Renewable energy that could charge cars/heatwater/cook food instead

Depends what tech or specification you want from the currency and what you believe is of important functions that bitcoin lacks.

The amount of energy used per transaction is just funny. The networks max transactions per second is also funny. The fact that you can lose coins so they can never be retreived and thus shrinking the coins in circulation is also funny. You can sell/get rid of your coins or stay with them and hope for its future. I would never invest in bitcoin.

BTC will drop to 0 and make place for a better designed digital currency. But BTC fanbois wont digest the facts but rather downvote this.

You invested in an outdated currency.

Educate me where I'm wrong or stay cool with the facts. Your move dude..
@_date: 2018-12-28 06:06:43
I would recommend moving on to another digital currency.
