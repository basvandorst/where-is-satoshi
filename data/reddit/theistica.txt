What is the security risk with making a web API call? Is it just not reliable? I’m just trying to figure out what the downside to doing that as opposed to a pruning node is. I'm planning to deploy everything here on an AWS EC2 server so space shouldn't be an issue.

Gotcha thanks! ZMQ is a sockets handling tool in Python right?

What is the downside to using a web API call? Is it just not as reliable?

Why not just call an API like BlockCypher and filter out the low transactions? Would that be a superior solution to manually doing it using Electrum?

I just need to know the net change in total balance for an address over time, so can I just do outputs (from a certain address) - inputs (from a certain address) for each transaction?

Unfortunately I don't have the storage the download the entire blockchain at the moment, so I think I'll stick w a web API for now :(

Yes I need to be able to automate it for new addresses in the future and on AWS through an API, and also the following website already seems to have an API for historical daily wallet balance updates (the confirmed balance; this is what I need):

Sorry for the late response, but do you have a link to how/where I can download a BTC pruning node? And what's the difference between using a pruning node and a wallet like Electrum, if my goal is to watch certain addresses on the ledger for incoming transactions?
