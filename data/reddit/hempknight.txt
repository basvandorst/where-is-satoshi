Chase is just pissed that it didn't invent bitcoin first... it tried to invent/patent some other form of cryptocurrency and all of its claims were denied.
Now it's starting to piss them off!  A good sign for bitcoin!  Stomp on some motherfuckin' toes bitcoin!!!

So - If I was a Chinese dude, I'd throw as much money as I could at bitcoin while it was legal, to get in on the "ground floor". Then, when bitcoin gets to the moon, take a vacation to a bitcoin friendly country and live like a millionaire.
I'm sure they'll figure out some way to use this anonymous internet currency in china, or anywhere else... Like piracy and porn - IT WILL FIND A WAY!

I withdrew everything when I read this, got it out just in time.  Hopefully this is only temporary.

I think comparing Bitcoin to internet piracy might be a better fit.  Piracy is "illegal" in every country.  Almost all gov'ts have been trying to stop it since...1996?  But, you can't regulate something out of existence when it is decentralized, and people want it.  Then, bittorrent was invented, now it uses something like 90% of all bandwidth, and lots of that bandwidth is "illegal".  There's only so much a government can do to thwart something big like bitcoin/bittorrent... It's like a wild fire - it does what it wants!  And the bigger it is, the less effect any gov't can have on it.
I been buyin' BTC up today!
