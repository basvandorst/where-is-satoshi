A whopping 1.5 BTC after getting back into mining recently with my 6950 (~340 mhash/s).

I'm a website content writer and have recently made a post in r/BitMarket (redd.it/idhts) offering my services for Bitcoins.
I've been writing for a couple years now and have always used Paypal for payments. I'm willing to accept Bitcoin for a couple reasons: 1) The fact of no central authority to complain to about getting ripped off is basically equal to Paypal's support, since my goods are digital, and therefore complaints never work out in my favor anyway; and 2) The idea of receiving payment in BTC, knowing that the BTC price could go up, is enticing. That is, if I receive 5 BTC for work that is worth $80 (@ $16 per BTC) and the price per BTC goes up to $20 (and if I decide to sell), then I just earned $20 without doing anything. Of course, the opposite applies as well, but I'm willing to take a risk.
I mine as well, but am only pulling in 330 mhash on my 6950, which took me about 4-5 days to get my first bitcoin.

Thanks for the reply. I think I read on r/bitcoinmining that it wasn't possible, but I wanted to make sure.
I just started up today and can't break 330 Mhash/s at +20% overclock, mem @ 520, fan @ 80% and with -v -w128 -f2 flags. I tried to increase the voltage but the slider doesn't go above 1100V. How do you increase that?

I think I am. I'm using the overclocking program that comes installed on Linuxcoin. I think it's called AMDControl or something?
I'll look at the MSI app. Thanks!

In case you missed the "Claimed" part, I already signed up with signalnine's code; no need to keep posting...

I think it probably was. I bought it new from Amazon.

Just put my ad out today and no hits yet. I hope there are enough webmasters here and on the forum to make it worthwhile.
