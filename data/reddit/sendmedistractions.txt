I'm not saying it isn't a barrier and that I'm super happy with the situation but bitcoin is set up to be decentralised. There might be a fairly small number of people that control the majority of the hash power as is but that's still an improvement on a single entity that nobody can challenge. 
If, for example, a bunch of people got together to fund raise and build their own mining rig to challenge the Chinese based on self supplied renewable energy or something, literally no one could stop you.

You're living in a fantasy.

You're right, people in this sub have an irrational allegiance to crypto that's just unhelpful in the long run. 
Gold has maintained its value as a commodity for thousands of years and you can't just ignore that. Bitcoin is great but it's only existed a few years. I love it and wholeheartedly believe it will be huge, but it would be so unbelievably niave to think it's as sound as gold.

Jesus christ how can you expect people to join the community and for more people to adopt bitcoin if you're just gonna tell them they're not hard core enough.
@_date: 2019-12-14 17:55:51
I was an early adopter too, I'm just living in reality. I'm a big believer, I went to university specifically to study relevant topics and wrote a dissertation on blockchain technology. I find it fascinating and support it wholeheartedly. I'm just not insane and recognise that it is not yet a fully matured technology. 
I'm done talking to you, you're insane and won't listen to reason. Bye.

I don't treat it like an investment or stock AT ALL. I don't have a portfolio, I don't invest my money. All my other savings are sat in the bank so I can use them to put down a deposit on a house. 
I've used bitcoin for many purchases over the years, I would probably be a millionaire if I'd just sat on those coins. I regret nothing. I generated a lot of wealth I wouldn't otherwise have had and I spent some of that accordingly. 
But that's not the point. Bitcoin was designed to be an inflational currency that appreciates in value over time. If you hold your savings as opposed to spending it, you're still using it exactly as intended. If you use it to move money around, you're also using it as intended. Holding bitcoin is not like leaving your sports car on the drive, a sports car will depreciate in value. It's more akin to investing in the company that's developing the technology, which will surely appreciate in value if the tech is so good.

Well said.
@_date: 2019-12-23 01:49:33
As I think the original commentator was implying, many people think that bitcoin will be treated as a settlement layer. 
That means that we have other software for everyday transactions, more akin to current day banking, and at the end of the day the providers of said software settle up with bitcoin. This is how banks work today. The difference being that with bitcoin, anyone can be a "bank."
So we treat bitcoin as the very secure underlying store of value and we build more convenient applications on top of this. With all software there is a constant trade off between security and convenience. In reality, most people favour convenience and so even though managing your own bitcoin is the most secure thing to do, most people don't want to.

Mining is about maximizing profit and the hardware doesn't have as long a life span as most hardware in data centres. Theres not much point investing extra time or money into aesthetics or maintainability.
@_date: 2019-12-23 01:36:58
There are a lot different ways things might go. Lighting network is great and is certainly one possibility but there is also the possibility of other software to extend the usefulness of bitcoin in a less direct way.
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:04:01
Lol bitcoin is dead you idiot
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:43:04
I partially agree with you but the fact is there's nothing really stopping you from doing the same. You might not have the capital, but that's pretty much the only barrier. The software is open source and there's no government or law that can stop you.
@_date: 2019-12-26 02:04:21
The "quality" of an investment is much more nuanced than whether or not it outperformed something else given an arbitrary time frame. 
I believe bitcoin to be better personally but that's whilst accepting a much greater risk than with gold. If I invest in gold I can be sure my family will benefit from my wealth for generations to come without any doubt. To some people, that would be "better."
@_date: 2019-12-16 14:50:58
Spot on, I've been holding for years and just selling a little here and there to cover bills. It's abundantly obvious to anyone that understands this technology that it will inevitably increase dramatically in price.
@_date: 2019-12-26 13:30:55
I mean it will be huge as a technology. I'm a computer scientist, I studied cryptography and Blockchain tech. I know the potential it holds. I'm not a financial advisor, I do not understand the economy or investments. 
With that said, since the moment I heard of bitcoin, I've done everything I can to acquire as many as possible because I understood that potential. 
It is extremely volatile but if you've been following it for a while you understand the cyclical nature of the price movements. I am confident enough that I have placed a quarter of my savings into bitcoin and I am very confident that I will see a return. Purely because the tech is solid and much more ground breaking than people realise.
@_date: 2019-12-14 17:45:29
I do use lightening network when it's convenient. You're missing the point. My landlord is a 70 year old technophobe and I like my house. I'm not moving just so I can pay rent in bitcoin.
Get real.
@_date: 2019-12-26 13:35:44
You would be very foolish to dismiss it.
@_date: 2019-12-15 00:00:19
Unfortunately, as with every monetary system that currently exists, yes.

Did you even original comment?
@_date: 2019-12-26 02:07:09
Anyone else never heard of any of these?
@_date: 2019-12-15 00:42:12
Aggressive control imposed by major governments could certainly set it back. For sure bitcoin can exist and function in those circumstances, but realistically most people aren't anti-government activists that would be willing to use it in such a scenario.
Or a major security vulnerability. I find this to be extremely unlikely but as someone who studied cryptography, it would be foolish to say it's impossible. Hopefully in such an event a retroactive patch could be rolled out to restore security though.
Most likely, and yet still improbable, would be some better alternative coming along. Whether that's better in terms of ease of use and accessability, or better in terms of security, or any number of other ways, I dont know. But if a better alternative were to arise and bitcoin did not adapt and change to keep up with the developments, then it might fail.

This sub is full of lunatics. Don't take financial advice or influence from anyone here. Read the news, look at the data, and make your own educated decisions. You probably know better than 90% of the people who post on this sub.
@_date: 2019-12-26 13:59:55
I didn't say I was certain of anything. I said some people, depending on the priorities, may consider it a "better" investment.
It really bothers me how people on this sub swear allegiance to crypto and entirely dismiss everything that came before it. That is irrational. I'm one of bitcoins biggest supporters but I recognise that it has a place alongside existing technology and concepts in this world.
@_date: 2019-12-14 17:31:56
While I support Bitcoin and want it to succeed, it's very short sighted to think that somebody can easily get by in today's society without using standard currency. I can't pay my landlord in bitcoin, I can't pay my bills with bitcoin.
Sure, there might be services out there that attempt to make those things possible, but that's just a long-winded way of selling bitcoin and involves trusting weird small startups with your money and finances. 
Bitcoin is great and I use it whenever it is convenient. But the fact is, it isn't convenient to use it all the time.
@_date: 2019-12-23 01:38:22
This reminds me of the "do something" meme followed by an unwanted result.

Highly recommend using any payment alternative other than venmo. It might seem a little inconvenient at first, but it's really not that hard to do online bank transfers or even cash trades using [LBC]( or similar.
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:56:35
I didnt entirely agree with keeping the block size small. I think it encouraged some great solutions, but I dont think a 1mb cap is required forever. 
The software is 100% decentralised and if anyone has a better solution to combat the capitalist society we live in that enables the rich to control more than the poor, they are perfectly able to propose said changes. The issue is not with bitcoin, it is with the existing distribution of wealth.

I remember when we first broke $1000 it was wild. Probably more exciting than when we broke $10k.
If I'm not mistaken it was either SIlk Road shutting down or Mt Gox going AWOL that lead to the subsequent crash. But, as always, we rose again stronger having learned valuable lessons.
