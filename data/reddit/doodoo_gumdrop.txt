Just noticed. Wonder why they chose that? Coinbase went with a green logo. The twitter handle for bitcoin cash is the old logo. Seems they are all out of sorts.

Why does every crypto price website start bitcoin data in 2013? It was around for like 4 years prior to that but no one displays that data.
