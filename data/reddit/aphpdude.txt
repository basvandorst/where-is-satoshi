It's been 6 and a half hours; how long usually does it take just to send coins to your wallet?  Does it take just as long if I used them to make a purchase?  What's another good exchange to use besides coinbase? Hypothetically what would happen if I kept them in the exchange? Just risky?

Ok thank you so much for taking the time to answer. Could it be possible that it's taking so long because its the first transfer ever for me

Yes I have; only thing I've learned is from folks on Reddit. I truly thank you for taking the time to answer my questions.   What is lightning functionality? I think your right and the wallet just needed to sync with coinbase because when I look at it; it says reconnect to an internet connection

I remember a story about Tesla meeting with the house of Morgan trying to secure investment money for a project involving sending energy for free to a ship at sea in the Atlantic. Morgan's response '' if I can't put a meter on it, not interested.'' Tesla's response... we don't have a meter measuring the air we breath. How different the world would be if everyone thought like Tesla

I think it was 15 cents I didn't lose the farm; it's my first time using but I'm still pissed. I thought crypto was supposed to cut out the greedy capitalism that is destroying America. Instead I find fees for purchasing; fees for transferring; fees for mining etc. My brick n mortar bank doesn't charge me to move funds from checking to savings and vice versa.

Can somebody please help??? I just sent my first Bitcoin from coinbase to connected wallet (correct address). I received email that transaction is complete but my wallet is empty. I was able to view the transaction which showed the money being deposited. So WHAT THE F JUST HAPPENED?

Could it be a segwit vs legacy wallet address issue? Ultimately it's my fault for not sending a small amount of money to make sure it works... but you know... transfer fees. I'm just sic

I'm all good thanks everyone for your input. I guess I just need to have patience

Thank you to all who replied; I have my coins just thought it was faster than half a day
@_date: 2019-12-05 17:48:25
It's been 2 hours and the transaction shows 12 confirmations. Is this normal? Thanks for taking the time to answer

I'm using coinbases wallet for ease of use or so I thought. Yes it is exact same address checked hundreds of times. I'm obviously new to Bitcoin any advice on different exchanges or wallets to use? Do I have to own a separate wallet for every type of crypto? Doesn't that become too cumbersome?  I was excited about investing and yes it sucks being at the mercy of complete strangers to troubleshoot your problems. I'm 33 years old and just had my 2nd stroke and I'm trying to leave something for my family. Boo hoo but I gotta figure this out
