I believe this is called mental accounting. It leads people to treat money differently depending on where it comes from. For example, you will be much more thoughtful when spending your hard earned income but more relaxed when using "free money", such as an inheritance, a gift, tax return, etc.
Ultimately this is a mistake. Because money is money and 1$=1$ no matter where it came from. If you treat all your money as if you earned it, you will likely make better decisions on how to spend it.

What mentality are you talking about? I never said donating was bad.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:23:12
This was a nice read. I would upvote you if you had been able to post it using a positive angle rather than bashing another subreddit

Lazy devs... are you a developer to make such an assertion? One thing I can't believe about this community is how people make technical assertions when they have not written a single line of code in their life.
What have you developed that gives you the right to call other devs lazy?
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:51:02
Seems like you are the lazy one then. Good luck getting lightning ready in the next decade

I hope you didn't have to give half of your Bitcoin to your ex-wife.

They are making huge gains, so don't worry about them. If anything you should feel bad you're missing out.

I'm pretty sure it took you longer than 5 minutes

These are actually the most peaceful times in human history. Not saying we don't need to change the system, but we're actually in a better place than ever before, so credit to humanity where it's due!

I respect your position but still strongly disagree. The 'needs proper amount of time and preparation' argument stops making sense when you realise this discussion started years ago. There has been more than enough time for 'the technical guys' to plan a safe hard fork.
I do agree with you in that the block size plays a small part. Increasing it does not scale Bitcoin, it only increases current capacity until blocks get full again. But that's exactly what I believe Bitcoin needs right now. It's not obsession and impatience. There is a real problem right now with fees and confirmation times that make other coins a much better alternative to do what Bitcoin was meant to do in the first place. Brushing this off as a non issue is also unhealthy in my opinion.

Sure. But BIP 148 could have also caused a chain split and significant damage and was still highly supported in this forum. 
I think there is definitely a double standard because only changes proposed by one group are considered valid, while everything else is shut down because there is no consensus.

On average, across the entire planet, less people are impacted by war than any other time in human history.
Even if I was in Afghanistan that would still be true, even though I as an individual am clearly impacted by war.

I just don't understand how people here can say things like


Who is this community at large? How was it measured?
Note that I'm not arguing wether a fork (soft or hard) is good or bad. I'm just pointing out that there is an incredible double standard when it comes to BTC code changes.
Why is blocking segwit considered a gridlock hampering Bitcoin's progress but keeping the block size artificially limited is not?
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:45:25
As far as I know Bitcoin has never promised a rise in value. You clearly didn't watch the video, and even though you know nothing about this stuff you feel the need to come to a Bitcoin forum to try and convince people they're stupid. You should be using your time more wisely, maybe buying some of that stock and assets you think are so secure.
Perhaps some people here "belive in great returns". I don't believe in anything. I have a set of private keys that allow me (and only me) to change some state in a global network without anyone's permission. Wether you find that exciting or useful is not my problem, but if you think the success of Bitcoin depends on the price then you just don't get it.
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:45:51
A couple of months ago you were in favour of a contentious soft fork, which arguably ceased to be contentious thanks to miners activating segwit using btc1 software.
There is definitely a double standard going on.
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:11:43
What would you replace it with? What makes you think it would be better? What makes you think it wont be corrupted as well?
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:11:06
I'm not even in the US. But the dollar is the world reserve currency so I'm pretty sure it's collapse would have devastating effects in the economy of every country.
Imagine a world where governments can't print money. Where does the first entrepreneur gets the necessary capital to start his business?
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:13:31
Absolutely agreed.
If I make money: look at me I'm so smart
If I lose money: damn greedy bankers! burn the system!
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:28:32
Hmm... I haven't blamed anyone. I'm just asking what is the reason behind this sentiment that I pick up by reading lots of threads in this and related forums. Also not defending anyone, but just making the point that this confrontational "us vs the banks" attitude is not only childish but also kind of dumb.
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:03:43
This is exactly the kind of comments I was referring to in my post.
Ok. Let's assume you are right and everything is corrupt and doomed to fail. Is it because the *system* is corrupt, or is it because the *people* within the system are corrupt?
We've tried replacing capitalism a few times during the twentieth century. Every attempt inevitably led to the genocide of millions of people. So I have two questions for you:
- what is your proposed alternative?
- and more importantly, what makes you think that alternative won't end up corrupted as well?
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:06:18
No. I don't see the irony. Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:14:53
Any suggestions what that new is? Any guarantees that such a system won't also be corrupted?
After all, it's the same greedy humans who will be running the show.
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:06:54
Sounds fantastic! But, what is that system and what makes you think it will be incorruptible?
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:18:47
This is really bad advice if you consider the tax implictions of selling coins.
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:18:47
You definitely seem like a fucking loser.
