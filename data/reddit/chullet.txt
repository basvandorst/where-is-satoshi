aside from calling it free when it isnt, i dont think the bank is doing anything wrong.  they charge a fee for a service you would not be able to execute otherwise.  they are a business and need to make money, they are not your friends.  having money in a bank is a service, not a privilege.  if you want to avoid actual fees for exchanging money, i urge you to look into bitcoin.

how do you connect to the internet without an ISP, can someone explain that?  Wouldn't you need the internet to begin with, in order to connect to all these nodes? what do ISP's do that I cant do on my own?

i actually made a post about this  i think the blockchain idea could be applied to in-game items, to put actual value on things because each item would be truly unique.

if you intend to hold for a long time, why concern yourself with hourly price swings... thats the difference between trading and investing.

this is such a misconception about purchasing cryptocurrency. you can buy as much or as little as you can afford to lose in an investment.  you can buy 50 bucks worth and forget about it.  i do most of my purchasing of btc in tiny amounts anyway...

If I hear "Elon Musk Will..." anymore, I'm going to start thinking he actually follows through on things.

 buy SLL using any card, and then convert to BTC. or try localbitcoins.com. as far as I know we dont have an ATM yet, but there should be one popping up any day now. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:21:48
you can buy small amounts with debit using quickbt.com

Can you explain the positives of Quark, and why we should pay attention to it? WHY do you believe in quark and its features.  how do they work and why are they better?

there is absolutely no way to tell at the current time if it will be profitable or not.  if btc goes to zero then obviously its not possible.  if btc goes to 10,000 or 100,000 then it will probably end up being very profitable to mine.  asking this question means you probably havent done nearly enough research to even consider dabbling in mining. there are tons of mining calculators out there, throw your stats into one, but change the price to match what you speculate the price to be.  even if you were to drop lets say $10000 total and mine 1 btc, if that 1 btc goes over 10000 then you are profitable.  anyone who straight up says "no" is just trying to deter you from making a few mBTC. the more miners there are, the more support for the network, deterring people from mining is almost the antithesis of everything that is bitcoin.

they do not believe in the idea, or see the potential that it has. i really think it has potential

I agree that most of the alt-coins seem too similar to bitcoin to stand a chance, but does quarkcoin bring anything new to the table?  Theres a chance in the future we will hold Bitcoin for value, and use Litecoins as "currency".  Is there really space for many more crypto-currencies? wont we end up with certain demographics only accepting certain coins, similar to currency of today?  From what I understand, Bitcoin aims to put everyone on the same playing field, so why are people/exchanges willing to support these other playing fields (excluding pump and dumpers)?

if i could sub using BTC, i would have long ago.
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:27:48
quickbt.com is maybe the quickest way to get small amounts of BTC in canada. just use a debit card as long as it isnt one of those Visa Interac cards. You can buy about 50 dollars worth a day im pretty sure. i use it regularly and have not had any issues over multiple transactions.

qr on the screen is almost as good.  i made another post about the shopping channel putting up a QR code so people could buy product straight from the couch. it would work for anything on television too. imagine a pizzahut add with a qr code and you can order pizza right from the commercial.

yes, but at the present time, people get paid in fiat. so i have much more fiat then i do btc.  im talking more about someone excepting combination payments. a large company might not want to accept full btc payments, because of the fluctuating price, they can lose lots on a sale.  if they were to accept a certain percent you can buy with btc, then there is less chance they lose lots on a certain sale.  ill use my new console example again.  taxes for something like that is 500 x .15 = 75 bucks in taxes here in canada.  im happy to spend my canadian dollars on the console, but would love the ability to pay a percent in btc, lets say .15  so about 75 bucks worth.

spread your btc wealth over multiple cards/address to avoid losing them or getting hacked? people have multiple bank accounts.

wouldnt you need massive hashing power? why doesnt every miner just mine small blocks for a big reward immediately after every block... im not sure i understand why or how this can happen.
