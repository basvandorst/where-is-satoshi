How long are they going to think about it?

I can promise you I own more Bitcoin than you ever will. I owned Bitcoin while you were still in diapers.

If they plan to increase the blocksize why didn't they just do it instead of allowing the fork to happen?

Considering I still own equal amounts of both, it's "our" coin is still 17k.

Getting screwed by an 18% transaction fee makes me a shill for some other subreddit. Are you 12 years old.
So we're all supposed to just be fucking happy that our money is virtually unusable and just go about our merry way?

So why are Bitcoin transactions so slow and expensive?

I love how he frames communists as some sort of good group being infiltrated instead of the fact that communists are the ones historically infiltrating other groups.
It isn't some conspiracy Andres. There will always be dissension and splits within an evolving group. Hell, even Satoshi knew this which is why the ability to hard fork exists.

Didn't realize gum costs $100.
We planned to give $100 paper wallets to friends and family as gifts for Christmas to spread the Bitcoin cheer, but it would cost us close to $1000 dollars in transaction fees to do so.
It's attitudes like yours, along with the high fees and slow transaction times that should have supposedly been fixed after the fork that are pushing people away.
Since I'm so unreasonable and dumb for thinking I should be able to transfer such a small amount of Bitcoin to friends and family to help grow their interest in crypto, I guess I'll just have to give away $100 worth of that shitcoin Bitcoin Cash and explain to them why.
Merry Christmas.

Ahaha .....OK.
You don't seem to get the fact that you're part of select minority of people that can't get over the fact that the changes the backers of Bitcoin Cash wanted for Bitcoin have resulted in Bitcoin Cash being the more viable and usable version of Bitcoin.
Why the butthurt? You got the technology you wanted in the fork and the name "Bitcoin. Certainly a shitcoin like BCash can't possibly compete in the open market with such superior technology and leadership like Bitcoin has.
Hopefully you sold all of your ~~BCash~~...er shitcoins as soon as you were able.

How much in fees will you pay to transfer your holdings?
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:50:09


You caught me. My cover is blown. I'm with a top secret unknown government agency and my mission is to keep the Bitcoin devs from actually doing anything to speed up transaction times and lower transaction fees.
My plan is all coming together now..... ahahahahahahaa.....

Lightning is much amaze.

Concern Troll? I just had to spend roughly 18% on a fee just to spend my fucking money. I'm not just concerned, I'm pissed. Everyone should be. 
The fucking coin forked over this shit and the problem is worse than ever.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:29:02
Thank you for taking the time to explain.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:46:14
How so?
