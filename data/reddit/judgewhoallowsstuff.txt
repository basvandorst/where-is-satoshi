They have a great sense of humor for mocking social justice whiners such as yourself

Oh, I get it now - you're an insane person.  
@_date: 2014-03-20 19:05:49
They spent too much time focusing on how the machinations of US government are good and optimal and a perfect representation of the popular will.  
@_date: 2014-03-20 19:37:48
It was too subtle, man.  Check your subtlety privilege.  
@_date: 2014-05-05 12:19:11
And when you write down values in *those* currencies, that's what you should do.  
Unless you just enjoy being indignantly wrong.

A few minutes of thought and research could yield that sort of information.  One example: pot smokers can't legally fill out a 4473 form to buy a firearm because they use a federally prohibited drug.  Start your search with things that are controlled by the fed.  Your state laws only protect you from your state government.

In case anyone is curious:

It's a parody.  Look at the date

Wake up, then have a piece of toast, and then.....

How is it cloaked when you're overtly calling attention to someone's lack of knowledge?  If someone is insulted when they're told they don't possess infinite knowledge that's one thing, but there's nothing underhanded going on.  
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:04:39
I put an edit in that's more on point.

That's not the only way they make money from you using their phone.

You would never be charged for perjury or contempt for that unless you are stupid enough to be obvious about it.

Someone in was telling me it's "undemocratic" that some FSP members amended a spending bill (through democratic processes) to decrease the amount to $0.  Because they didn't like the result, basically. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 19:07:09
That's a lot of hash.  
@_date: 2014-10-14 00:49:56
Same as if it had been USD.

I'm trying to give a shit but it's just not happening.  Phrased wrong, got it.  Let's move on.  
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:59:00
So if they're taking offense *in error*, how is he guilty of crafting a cloaked insult?  
That's like if I tell my girlfriend she looks nice today and she says "What, I don't look nice every other day!?" And then you say my compliment was in fact a cloaked insult.  
Edit:  More to the point, why do you assume there was any intent to insult?
@_date: 2014-12-26 14:46:30
That wouldn't "show" that they never considered it. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 14:28:24
How does this show that they listed bitcoin by accident?  
@_date: 2014-01-01 19:14:11
Except the prohibition of alcohol actually was repealed, unlike that of marijuana.

The 2014 dollar would be worth $.93 in 2010 dollars.  
@_date: 2014-04-21 16:54:22
So really it's the "best" post, not the top post.  
@_date: 2014-03-20 18:59:40
And the dollar would be worth $.93
@_date: 2014-08-09 07:26:26
Ok let it get ruined by gradual shifts away from the "live free" way of life.  Totally a good idea to oppose the libertarians who are balancing out the gradual authoritarian shift NH is seeing. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 13:47:59
So is the assumption that any time the word is used, it's being misused?  
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:46:30
Actually if every billionaire did that, it would be inevitable (and immediate).  The problem would be trying to sell before all the other billionaires.

Symptomatic of posting on an American website in English during prime US internet activity time.  
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:19:53
Dude. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:23:07
I collected a bunch of state quarters as a hobby.  Now they're just sitting in my basement, losing value.  
Not too thrilling, but a fairly normal hobby. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:14:50
Sweet. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:23:43
It's not an activity now.  It was an activity for about as long as setting up a bitcoin computer would have been an activity.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:33:18
Fuck shit I don't know about
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:24:30


Sounds like a normal hobby.

Is that darknet?  (I don't know what I'm talking about.)

Can you pick out next week's winning lotto numbers for me?  
Thanks.

Citation needed.  
Does it get you on double secret probation? 
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:39:51
Was he convicted of that? 
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:50:32
I'm surprised you're still downvoted after trying to drum up an SRS posse to come brigade the thread.  
You need to learn to be a better moron.  You've got to branch out to new echo chambers, like ELS.

Oh yeah?  The jerk store called - they're running out of you. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 13:48:30
They were probably being funny.  
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:58:39


Can you give me the rundown?  
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:10:45
Can you explain what you mean by that
