Maybe I understand this wrong but, is it expected that larger blocks will become full any time soon? And if so, what would be the alternative if nothing would be done, since 4MB of transactions won't fit in 1MB.
I feel like larger block size is the only solution, but I have too little actual information about what the problem really is. The fact that there are so many posts makes me feel this is important. Tomorrow I'll look at the pros and cons and if more nodes is what it takes, I'll setup an extra one.

Me too. Looks like we dodged a bullet there.

That's not a strange idea. Even paying in currencies other than Bitcoin would be okay. It's mainly the outdated distribution network that causes this. I believe most people are willing to pay for content if the content is offered in the right way and at the right price. Paying for redundant services is never going to happen.

Not really. P can now have the nickel with initial M and vice versa while there is no direct connection between the two. Plus, there are most likely more than two parties providing inputs. Because in the real situation you don't know who the other parties are that put money into the jar, the only thing you will know if you track certain 'coins' is that whoever spends them used the same fogging service.

This is an important thing to realize with cryptostuff like Bitcoin. I once saw a video series about cryptography and it used the same example of a number of coin flips. You probably can't see the difference between the human made and the real random row of coin flips, but it's usually easy to see by comparing the difference in sequences of multiple flips.

I get exactly the same (missing c++ package and virus in two temporary .bat files) on Windows 7 (64 bit).
Downloaded the c++ package from [here]( but to no avail.

No, they don't. They do provide a service, but in a way this is somewhat similar to a guy stealing bread and selling it to the bakery's customers. That's wrong and at first I was a bit scared because of the negative effect this will probably have on the image of Bitcoin.
However, as MorXpe noted, being able to track all payments in the blockchain ( may visualize the willingness of people to pay for content and might move the actual content creators to change their distribution network.
I'm left with mixed feelings, but I hope this will have a positive effect on content distribution in the long run.

Thank you. It all comes down to the incredible improbability of a collision (I like the way they worded it) and the fact that alternative use of the processing power can reap greater rewards.
