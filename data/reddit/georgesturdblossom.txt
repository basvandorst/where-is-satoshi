But how to support decentralization?
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:02:13
I want to move my coins to a segwit address, but my main wallet has a large number of utxos. It makes the consolidation tx large and the current fees are uneconomical (i.e., I would lose most of the utxo value to the fee).

If we raised the blocksize, wouldn’t we be just as bad as Btrash? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:15:09
I have all three and like KeepKey the best. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:15:19
Btrash’s entire argument is based on usability for everyday purchases. They don’t understand that usability doesn’t matter. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:09:01
Bcash is a cheap trick. They increased the blocksize so more transactions go through at a low fee. Raising the blocksize on BTC would make it usable again for regular purchases, but the main proposal to do it (segwit2x) did not come from the core devs. We will only agree to raise the blocksize if the core devs propose it because CEOs do not control bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:45:41
If usability is so important, then why don’t the core devs increase block size?
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:57:15
You must be wrong. Otherwise why did Greg Maxwell say he was popping Champaign when the fees got so high recently?
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:55:28
I have no desire to be like btrash because I don’t use altcoins.  Bcash is bribing users with low fees to try to get them to use the coin.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:15:29
No, I would rather pay $100 tx fee than raise the block size because CEOs don’t control bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:09:07
No it was the CEOs who wanted to raise the block size. We stopped them. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:20:52
No, we fought so hard against segwit2x, we can’t just raise it now. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 06:38:40
What do they mean by "support?" 
@_date: 2016-03-05 05:54:13
Response? They will just tell theymos to delete this thread!

What kind of products do they sell?
@_date: 2019-11-15 04:10:52
Bittrex has a USD/BTC market. That list looks incomplete.
@_date: 2016-06-13 14:31:41
I wonder how miners calculate their cost basis. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 04:42:37
Post a link to your transactions from a block explorer.

Common law is a system of legal precedent that originated in France and came to England with the Normans. 
Civil law was an invention of Napoleon based on statutory construction rather than precedent. He abolished the common law in all countries he conquered because an independent judiciary was an impediment to his reforms. His system persists to this day, and its practitioners often view common law as obsolete and archaic. That may be true but the common law judiciary does provide one of the checks and balances of the US government. 
My apologies to OP for the pedantic comment because he probably meant something else when he said common law but I couldn't resist.

Big fan of keepkey. It’s basically a Trezor with nicer hardware. I like that the full address appears on the screen and you don’t have to wait for it to scroll like on the ledger nano.
@_date: 2016-06-17 19:13:17
Common law only exists in the UK, US, and former British colonies. Europe and most of the rest of the world are under a system called civil law. So no, if you live in the most civilized part of the world you do not necessarily have to follow common law principles.

It's 40k stuck transactions.

Segwit only had 30% support before the 2x part.

All time high, not all exchange high all time high.

Yeah ... Not paying your taxes is not going to change the system. Just means you will get fined and lose some gains. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:28:46
Better to pay insane fees than raise the blocksize. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:05:51
That you even have to ask shows you know nothing about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:12:55
Anyone who disagrees is wrong and was misled by the CEOs who were trying to line their own pockets. I would rather have $100 transaction fees than 2x blocksize. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:59:52
What % of mempool is zero fee?
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:16:54
+1 on the hardware wallets. KeepKey is back in stock on Amazon after being unavailable for a while.

I wouldn't read too much into him being an inventor on this patent. There are many reasons why an organization may choose to file a patent application, and he likely was under a contractual obligation to cooperate whether he wanted to file or not. He likely got a draft of this thing from a patent attorney, gave a few comments, then signed it. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:15:21
I dunno. Biggest sticking point seemed to be the price fluctuations. Everyone seemed to think the BTC would lose value and wipe out the profit margin before it could be turned into USD. Also the dispensary would need an exchange willing to do business with them. That's more of a valid point as it may not be as easy as opening a Coinbase account like it would be for other businesses. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 14:22:46
There are ways to get them out. I ended up emailing Mike and he helped me get the coins back. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 22:58:33
Did you know trezors are hierarchical deterministic wallets? That means you get a 24 word seed that can recreate the wallet at any time. You could throw the hardware away and it wouldn't matter. As long as you have the seed written down somewhere, you can recreate the wallet and the coins will be there. You could even memorize the seed. Far safer than storing online. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:06:24
So far as I can tell there are none. I raised the idea once on and was downvoted to oblivion and every post saying how Bitcoin is stupid, too hard to use, not real money, price fluctuates way too much, went bankrupt in 2013, etc. Seemed like no one has tried it. 
Edit: but by all means enjoy your legal toking! IMO nothing beats buying a nice grade sativa and going for a hike in the Colorado mountains!

Can someone please ban him for shilling an altcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-21 01:48:53
Bitstamp, a bitcoin exchange. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:05:15
I would say what I really thought, but the mods would throw me in the gulag. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:24:15
The real flippening will never happen. No one wants a premined shitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:26:16
I see. You need gdax to set a limit order with Coinbase. Are Gemini or Kraken available in your state?
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:51:48
I have a pending withdrawal limit request in with them that is two weeks old. Gemini has unlimited outgoing wires . . .
@_date: 2017-06-14 01:57:14
Both are US-based exchanges and offer USD/BTC. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:34:41
You didn't have a limit buy order in place?
