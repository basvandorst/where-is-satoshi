Actually a lot of pornsites already do accept Litecoin. ALS Scan. SexArt. The entire MetART network I think.
But the VHS vs Betamax analogy is a poor one. I've heard a lot of people use this argument but it doesn't stand up.
In the 80s, most households could only afford *one* videorecorder, and consequently had to make a choice: VHS or Betamax. 
Butterfly effect: For some reason, households gradually took a slight preference to VHS and after that, the format benefited from having the  greater network effect, consolidating it's dominance.
With BTC and LTC, the wallets are free. You don't have to pay a shit load for a VCR. The choices are reversable, hence the analogy doesn't fit.
@_date: 2014-01-03 15:32:05
Firstly if Bitcoin was created by a US governmental group it wouldn't be the NSA. It would probably be a governmental group you have never heard of.
Secondly, the US is only a part of a bigger global chain of secular revolutionaries, so if it *was* a 'governmental' operation it would most likely be carried out on an international level.
Thirdly, I think most people understand Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym for a collective - no real issue there.
Fourth, the fact posts are made in British English is meaningless. The British *invented* English and is spoken all over the world as an international language. Sure, you could talk about US intervention in Japan as being a factor, but really it's too sketchy to consider.
Fifth, anyone who has quietly studied the media zeitgeist over the past ten years will have already concluded bitcoin is quietly being promoted and protected by the international western media. Yes it's a big thing, so are many other things. 
Individually, you roll with it. Protect yourself. I doubt the endgame is to destroy a Bitcoin itself, but there may well be a plan to destroy the banks.
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:06:40

Yep it really is as simple as that. On a spiritual level freedom is sacred. As humans on this planet, we are prisoners.

Personally, I'm quite comfortable taking responsibility for my own actions and am happy to face the consequences of my mistakes. But yeah okay, I understand that there are people among us who don't like this degree of self-autonomy.
However, I envisage many 'middle-man' technologies that can take care of this easily within the BTC framework. Credit cards and Paypal all sit comfortably on top of the USD system so I don't see the difference.
It doesn't mean Bitcoin "will fail to become the dominant currency".
@_date: 2016-01-07 08:39:58
The solution is that in time, we'll see big third-party "online wallets" popping up that offer insured protection of funds. Banks, essentially, but based around Bitcoin rather than fiat. This will lead to direct-debits and standing orders, and the types of automatic transactions that most people take for granted.
Whether you decide to use such a service, or whether you have money in the account to cover the debits.... well that's something else.

Not a great system. Anyone can search the blockchain and choose a txid and say that it was their payment when really it wasn't. This would lead to multiple victims claiming the same transaction.
I doubt a window would pop-up and say "Sorry sir, but that transaction ID has already been taken."
Most likely it would instead silently fail and the victim would be left thinking that payments don't remedy the situation, so wouldn't bother paying again. Trust in the ransomware would diminish and payments would stop.

I know what I think, and that there is a very small number of people among us who have gone a bit weird, and become slightly obsessive about bitcoin to the point where they now view other crypto-currencies as other tribes. I don't really have much respect for these types of people, and that is especially true now I learn that Wall Street types are now infiltrating the Bitcoin community stirring up hate and dividing us. Then of course there are those who have made millions from Bitcoin and have suddenly turned into self-serving jerks. I own Bitcoins and Litecoins and I no doubt will own other coins. For me I am more interested in fighting the media, and the banks, and the establishment, than resorting to the bizarre (and frankly primitive) attitudes that you are here espousing.

I see the communities of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Peercoin and Namecoin becoming closer together as they collectively do battle with non-mineable and centralised coins as well as "corporate-coins".. (e.g Applecoin? Rothschildcoin?).
I also see Bitcoin rising back up over $1000 as a consequence of fiat instability in various sectors as people begin to trust it more than they do they're own banks and governments e.g Cyprus Part 2. 
Hardware wallets becoming big. Porn sector embracing Bitcoin significantly. Tax issues become prominent.
Big year for Litecoin too expanding on its successes in China. Peercoin will finally get some of the recognition it deserves.
Dogecoin will also do well but will most likely continue its "fun" network effect and evolve into something suitably fun (gaming?) rather than a serious store of wealth or anything that could be relied upon in an economic apocalypse.
There will possibly be an explosion of corporate consumer clones (McCoin, PepsiCoin KFCCoin etc) as well as ridiculously scammy altcoins (MileyCoin, Biebercoin, ChuckNorrisCoin etc).
Oh... and Hollywood will try to make a movie about Satashi Nakamoto but will fail because they don't know anything about him.

Hmm. The analogy doesn't really work though does it. If you have a bill for the materials then that is something. Bitcoin isn't constructed out of elements that can be priced. If someone has set a value of $5 for utility, then fine but that's one person's analysis that is derived from prediction, not a price list of materials. In any event it is someone's personal assessment; not Greenspan's.
Greenspan has said he doesn't know what the intrinsic value is at all, and thus he shouldn't claim it is overpriced.
