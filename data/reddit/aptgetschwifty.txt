Correct. Bitcoin doesn't currently have a passive method of adding transactions to the ledger since only a Proof of Work based validation is implemented.

I thought this was just something HBO did for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver lololol. I can't believe it's an actual song.

Damn. You just owned that guy.
"I'd correct you trivially about how, but.." sounds a lot like, "I don't know what I'm talking about"

I feel this on so many levels right now, as I gaze with glossed over eyes at an unfinished python script.

Well sure. One could intuit that from the impeccable accuracy of some of the equations that predict the probability of where the collapse of a wave function for any subatomic particle will take place.

That's a nice theory too.

Life *may* be a sea of randomness, chaos, and entropy, OR it maybe already be completely predetermined and free will may not exist. Quantum physics will solve the mysteries of the universe eventually.

How about eternal inflation? It's possible there are new universes bursting into existence everywhere all the time. I like that theory. Did we just become friends?

That doesn't make any sense. It's inter-generation bashing, and it's so annoying seeing "Ok boomer" non stop all day. I understand inter-generation competition has been a thing since the beginning of time, but seeing the same zero effort comment 1000 times on every sub that I frequent is just irritating.
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:19:52
Well philosophy is philosophy. It's called a fork because of it's origin, which is the bitcoin core and it's blockchain. I don't really care for any of the forks either, jsyk.
@_date: 2019-08-02 02:12:32
Well they are hard forks though.. So the title is accurate. lol
That being said, the hash rate differential is definitely indicative of the expanding ubiquity of bitcoin, and proof that other coins are being further ostracized..
Though I don't think other coins should be trashed. The entire point of cryptocurrencies is security and freedom from government controlled fiat. While other coins may not be as legitimate as bitcoin, their creators have every right to show the world what they've built. As long as they're not trying to scam people, who cares.
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:36:16
Forks have separate paths.. and a shared origin. Exactly like the aforementioned coins. That remark just strengthens my point lol.

~~Is the device pingable from any other device on your LAN?~~
Never mind you said you nmapped it, so obviously.
What's the output of sudo systemctl status sshd ?
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:29:56
I never once said they started at the same point. Not once. Just that they have an identical genesis block and that the field has set in place nomenclature for this occurrence, which is called a FORK. Your opinion of other coins comparatively to bitcoin is completely irrelevant to the discussion. Bcash is not another bitcoin, it is it's own project that happens to have an identical genesis block, thus making it a fork. Beyond that it has nothing to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:52:17
LOL no one said they're the same. Just because they have the same genesis block doesn't mean they're the same. But they are related, and any coin that shares a genesis block with one that came before it is a fork of that coin. I didn't make the rules, or define the terminology, but that's what it is. I also don't care for them, and I'm not defending them, I am just saying that based on the terminology the field has outlined bcash is a fork of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:08:18
Are you trolling? lol. Can you tell me the parameters of the first block of bcash? It's exactly the same as bitcoin. Therefore, they share an origin.

Hey thanks! And balls! Hmmm.. Is it a 3B/3B+? Cause you could try to flash raspbian to a flash drive and boot from that, and see if you then have access to the rootfs of raspbiblitz on the mSD,

But if btc replaces fiat, how will I make money off btc?!?!?! /s
@_date: 2019-08-02 03:45:11
Well no they're not compatible with bitcoin clients, hence the fork haha. But people who don't realize bitcoin's scarcity are just uneducated about cryptocurrencies/computer-science in general. It only take a quick glance at the source and some simple math to figure out exactly how many coins there are for any given coin.
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:37:45
Yes, that is what makes a fork a fork. If it doesn't have it's own genesis block it's a fork. It doesn't matter how legitimate they are, the definition of a "fork" comes from software repository forking, wherein the original software is used as a base and manipulated from there. If they didn't use the same genesis block, they wouldn't be forks.
Source: I am a software engineer and have built blockchain enabled applications, as well as run private block chains that were both forks, and fresh starts.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:41:27
Not history, origin. The origin of the blockchain is the same. I didn't claim they have the same history, just the same foundation, origin. Their genesis block.
@_date: 2019-08-17 15:23:03
What the shit?! That is pretty bizarre haha. I like helping people when I can, and the reddit gold/premium, while kind of trivial is a really awesome way to show your thanks and I definitely appreciate it. Don't hesitate to hit me up if you run into any other config issues, or anything relative to the Lightning Node/blockchain as well, as I have a bit of experience there too! Have a great day my dude!
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:15:28
It is a fork if it uses the same genesis block. Literally by definition. You have to "copy and paste" the genesis block because it's hard coded.
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:43:25
It *should* work, since it's just a config file and you don't need to chroot or anything to get to it. That's crazy there's no access to the terminal at all though. Are you sure there's no escape sequence or something to take you to management/rescue mode. Seems crazy to me that they wouldn't have a feature like that.
@_date: 2019-08-02 20:20:56
No you seem to be confused. Of course they're isolated, that doesn't mean that the first block of both chains aren't identical to the BIT. Absolutely identical. To say that two things that have an identical component don't share that component just because you think one is better than the other doesn't make sense. I am a software engineer, and have written *from scratch* blockchain implementations. I can guarantee you I have more knowledge than you do on the subject. Scarcity has literally zero to do with what we're talking about, but you can try to throw some more buzz words around to drive your nonsensical point home.
@_date: 2019-08-02 20:03:43
DUDE IT'S THE SAME FUCKING BLOCK! There's no way to get it in the source without copying and pasting it! lol If two people have the same eye color, do they share that eye color, or did the second person just copy the first? Lol what you're saying makes no sense.
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:49:29
They do when they share an origin...
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:35:03
Shiiiit Of course it's the one you can't boot from USB yet haha. You can't just plug the mSD card into a PC and edit the sshd_config from there?
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:09:54
But it is? By definition. They didn't build a new chain from the ground up, they still use the original Bitcoin's genesis block.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:51:47
Dude, the entire field's definition of a fork is a coin that shares the same genesis block as the coin that it is forked from. End of story. Your philosophies are yours, but that doesn't change an established definition by a field.
Here is bcash's genesis block:
Here is btc's:
They are the same.
