Yes but you were referencing direct concern of the government employees switching to illegal activities, I was just saying the likelihood of that is extremely slim.

Would someone who is in the top of their field rather make $350,000 a year doing completely legal work for the government, or the same rate while having to constantly watch their back and worrying about losing everything they have worked for?
By the time you would even be making the same amount of money illegally, the odds of you getting caught by someone who is just as good working for the government is exponential. Usually they get you with following the money, taxes and so forth. Otherwise, everyone would just be doing the illegal work, right?

Yes, but why do it that way? If you want to sell the Bitcoins, you sell them.

I mean, they caught him though and auctioned off the wallets. You have to imagine perhaps the Feds knew very well what they were doing. It can be easy to underestimate the government, but I sure wouldn't. Don't have the technical knowledge? Throw millions of tax payer dollars at it for "homeland security" in form of powerful exploit tools and force the best hackers who get caught up to work for you in exchange for asylum. Most exploits are found by governments throwing endless money at searching for them, not some "leet hacker". The scary difference being when they find one, its possible for no one else to ever learn of it.
You caught a hacker? Great force him to catch 5 more and he can go back to Serbia. Force those 5 to each catch a few more, etc. Hell the government is the scariest thing there is IMO.

But you only need one wallet for that. This going into multiple wallets that appear to be the same party.

Yup no need to divide it up if you are going to sell it. Unless obfuscation, in which case you would roll the whole thing and not break it down nicely like this. Probably the not all eggs in one basket idea for storage.
