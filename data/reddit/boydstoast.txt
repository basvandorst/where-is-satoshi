We don't have a dictatorship, we have a deadlock. Just like congress!

It addresses the very real issue of miner centralization, and it's only a contingency plan at this point.
Also, we don't negotiate with terrorists.
"Give me $5."
"Give me $5 or I'll shoot you."
"I'm wearing a bullet proof vest."
"You spent hundreds on a bulletproof vest but you can't give me five measley dollars!?"

Yup. That's the only real way to be safe.
The irony of BU:
* Insists the average user doesn't need a full node.
* Proves exactly why the average user needs a full node.

Ah yes, the famous "inverted elephant with a stick up its ass" pattern. Haven't seen one of those in quite some time.

China ban Bitcoin, so now Bitcoin ban China. Or something like that.

Would that really be an attack? Sounds more like a "normal" hard fork process than anything else. (i.e. miners start to signal their support, and the vast majority eventually does, a hard fork occurs.)
I know some hard fork supporters (BU, etc) get a little, err, *feisty*, but that doesn't mean every hard fork signal is malicious.

Tiny blocks are bad, cuz they get nothing done. Huge blocks are bad, cuz they bloat the blockchain. 2-4 MB is a good medium, which the segwit turtle is slowly crawling towards.

Well, it depends on which Satoshi you're talking about:
* [Decoy Satoshi (Dorian Nakamoto)](
* [Fake Satoshi (CSW)](
* [Cold Storage Satoshi (Hal Finney, on left)](
* [Or maybe this guy (Nick Szabo)](
(no one knows who he is)

Can confirm, Craig Wright is Satoshi. I know this because I am in fact Craig Wright. (This is my alt account.)

If blocks are too small you get problem A, if blocks are too big you get problem B. There's an optimum size somewhere, but it's hard to know what it is.
If someone stands to profit from small blocks, they're probably arguing for a smaller-than-optimum blocksize. If someone stands to profit from big blocks, they're probably arguing for a bigger-than-optimum blocksize.
Of course most of the big players have a horse in the race of some sort, which is why it's hard to get an informed &amp; unbiased opinion on what the optimum blocksize really is.

Sure I can... but I don't really feel like it right now.
In the meantime, can you provide 100% proof that I'm *not* CSW? If not, then I guess we all just get to have our own opinions.

* Blockstream wants to keep the block size small
* Small blocks force users to use 2nd-layer technology
* Blockstream stands to profit from 2nd-layer technology
Of course, we need to limit the blocksize for the sake of security. (SPV alone lets miners hardfork without opposition.) And we need 2nd-layer technology to really scale. But it seems like a conflict of interest when a major proponent of the above directly stands to profit from these changes. For example, they might want to restrict the block size more than is necessary, to force adoption of 2nd-layer technology earlier than is necessary.

In many cases it would be straightforward like you're saying, but Bitcoin's a little weird in this regard:
- The github repository is not the original home of Bitcoin. I believe it started out in [this]( SourceForge repo.
- It's unclear who (if anyone) owns the rights to the name "Bitcoin".
So yeah. The whole thing's a mess.
If anything good comes from the hard fork it will be that we'll finally have a good idea of what the community actually wants, from the relative prices of the two chains. (Kinda like how the Bitcoin Cash price shows that there is some interest in 8MB without Segwit, but not a huge amount.)
