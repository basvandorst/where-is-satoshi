So people over at the thread are speculating that they're using this 
to hash. Very interesting stuff, I'm getting a major tech-boner from this.

If this is correct will we see a re-do of 2011? Wasn't the big fall back then caused by mtgox getting hacked?

This kind of happened to me too. I downloaded the "standard" bitcoin client, it generated an address for me, and when syncing at around 15k block someone had sent something like 0.03 to it O_o.

Forgive me for my ignorance but would this issue be an issue at all with Litecoin? (this is not an ad or anything, I'd really like to know)

Indeed. Will be interesting to see how PRC government is going to react if it really picks up. Would be hard to say whether is was negative or positive for Bitcoin if China makes it illegal first.

Do you people actually work and live in Japan? How are the laws in there? How is it overall?

I actually don't mind ads at all when they are as unobtrusive as the ones on bitcoin.clarkmoody.com
Also ads are important in promoting Bitcoin accepting businesses.

You can already use Ripple to trade BTC by setting Bitstamp as exchange. I wouldn't move big sums though before Ripple developers release the source.

Also, I don't really think there's any good way to estimate how much time does it take to download to x block, since blocks are of varying size.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:51:03
go to blockchain.info
search your address (that you sent the funds into)
there you can see the block that the transaction is included in.

I can confirm this. I just woke up.

I wish the government run alcohol shop was open today so I could pop some champagne :(

I've strongly felt that the recent sharp rise is a speculative bubble and I shouldn't buy now. On the other hand, I can't shake this feeling that the train is leaving the station.

Bitmit is very good. I've bought three things from there so far. The site is a bit slow though.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:49:22
I use Bitstamp. 
@_date: 2013-02-01 01:34:39
Fuck. Should've bought one when I had the chance. Did they have paypal as a payment option?

Bullshit. Deflation is terrible for a currency. Any currency. I'm fairly sure that the fairly low reddit gold sales were because Bitcoin was rising so sharply.

Hmm... He might be afraid of posting his address or something fearing being identified.
To prove his wealth he should tip me somewhat large sum to show that he got 'em bitcoins to throw around.
