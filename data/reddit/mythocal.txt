I’m a dumbass, broadly speaking when it comes to crypto... def not posturing as an expert. Just struck me that while ‘bitcoin’ is an amazing thing in and of itself (disclaimer - I own small stakes in btc &amp; bch), it’s the foundation of the tech in which the ‘coin’ is built that makes sense in his talk. He knows more than I do (understatement) so you’d need to ask him. But the crypto tech can def be seen to carry the weight he’s describing...

Fantastic - this is exactly the help I need. Plenty of research to do from here but you’ve provided the structure and path I’ve wanted. I’ve seen people tip on here but haven’t a clue how to do it - but this is tip worthy. Thank you very much for the assistance. Cheers!

Swap ‘bitcoin’ with ‘cryptocurrency’ in his description (or better, ‘blockchain’ as a concept) &amp; you see where he is going. Secure identity, impact on real estate deeds, purchase records of all types, provenance or goods, fractional investment vehicles of myriad kinds...  think large scale

Yes. My thoughts exactly

Indeed - the tokens are the key for future use (as I understand things)

Indeed, sole proprietor. I intend to use the cellphone approach but am considering the options beyond the Coinbase on the phone. Venmo is the option of choice for most clients currently. But the issue of coin ownership sticks in my mind as I accumulate coin through coinbase purchases... thank you for your help

Makes sense - I suppose the original creators of things had the bigger picture in mind all along

I really appreciate this thoughtful response - the small, boutique Pilates studio I own might not benefit much from accepting bitcoin payment &amp; as my dabbling in coin ‘ownership’ has been limited to coinbase as well, I’m keen to smarten up a bit &amp; raise my game to where I can own the coin and accept it for the business. Might you steer me to a thread or other resource that could help?  Thank you in advance
