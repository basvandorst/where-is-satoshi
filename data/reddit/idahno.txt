Didn't sound to me like if SEC denies on March it's game over for bitcoin ETFs
Thanks though!

lol the first time I actually learned what it stood for (did get the gist of it tho)

Thanks for the answers, I too think they explain the issue quite well. There's one thing I don't quite get though. How does LN work? Would the node runners also run a LN "node"? There's the argument LN would also centralize the transactions and the currencies. Why would that be or why not? 
Also, do you have a good source where I could do further reading on Segwit and Lightning Network?

Please elaborate. Sorry if I don't take the word of someone on the internet at face value

I mean, they're not wrong about those arguments you know...

Good points there. I love bitcoin's concept, and believe me, I don't like the whole centralized trust-based system as a whole. Not discounting ATM's power usage, I still think BTC uses way too much power, there should be (and there are) other better ways to do it. Plus other reasons that are hindering widespread adoption like transaction times, scalability... (I know it's being worked on, both on BTC and others, but it's still far away from being a working, more convenient alternative for the systems in place)
On the other side, i think "pain in the ass to set up one" referred to the whole hassle of learning this whole new system and using it properly. Yes, I helped my mom set a wallet up and sent her a few sats and she learned how to pay and receive, but it doesn't mean she understands how to be safe, why, how not to get scammed, and much less how it works. For most people its just "wierd internet coins"
