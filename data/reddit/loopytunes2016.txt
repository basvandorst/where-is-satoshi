Did I lose my girlfriend because of bitcoin?

It’s pretty important to talk about the difference if bitcoin and bcash, as well as to point out any possible scams. Highly related to reasons why this sub exists

Yea honestly if you believe in the concept enough to have a conference about it, you should be confident enough to accept it as payment since that’s essentially the behaviour your trying to encourage 
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:44:04
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:56:02
My method is since I believe in the concept, is to focus more on the amount of bitcoin I have rather then the dollar value of what I have.
So while the price is dropping I’ll typically buy some more even if it’s not bottoming out
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:18:33
I️ have no clue what happened there...
Edit: or here
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:40:09
Literally at the fuck it point where I just buy bitcoin when I can, no matter the price.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:32:41
It’s 10K in CAD :) I get to be like remember bitcoin? It’s worth 10 thousand now
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:29:45
Well Coinbase used to allow me to set up my account for selling bitcoin as well so I also assumed it would work, after the update it does not let me even get past clicking the sell button all of a sudden, saying “this option is not supported in your country”. I live in the far away secluded land of Canada where we live in igloos and hunt beaver using muskets, so I guess I don’t need to sell my bitcoin?? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:15:34
I️ mean I️ agree but there’s a pretty decent chance that it drops soon with the amount it’s gone up. Might not be for a while, but if it does I️ know I️ will be buying more

I know one person, the guy who told me about it. I recently asked him how he would define it and he gave a good explanation for the most part, but he straight up admitted he had no idea how it actually worked or any of the actual technology’s that make bitcoin what it is. 
Everyone else I know that has heard of it has no clue why it’s valuable. To me that just means that bitcoin still can go a long ways.
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:04:36
There actually is one by me, I’ve used it before but I don’t remember how good the rates were... bitcoin atms are actually extremely useful though 
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:09:19
Caption kinda gets me. I don’t know a single person who actually understands bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:17:42
If he accumulated more bitcoin then he previously had from trading, and doesn’t invest a large amount of his bitcoin into trades he will be fine.

Nah dude, one lambo? Millions. Quit playin
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:34:13
I don’t get how people are missing your point aha 
This graph only shows successfully adopted technologies and bitcoin. If this graph showed all technologies their would be plenty of less innovative or less groundbreaking technologies that soared much higher than bitcoin only to plummet to its demise. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:22:10
I like your style 
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:21:40
I guess even just having that in the public to create awareness isn't so bad. It makes it seem more legit to doubters I feel like

Are you talking about the Government?
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:04:46
You can tell these guys HATE the fact that bitcoin is proving resilient and is showing staying power, they are trying to pay there dues by saying it "recovered well" and "Blockchain technology has potential" but they are brushing off what bitcoin has actually achieved and they seem to give off the idea it's only a matter of time before it's gone, I think it was a good discussion but they should of had some one who owns and actively trades cryptocurrency, these guys literally laughed when asked if they own a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:12:22
C’mon Polish Banks’s that’s like 2 bitcoins good luck with that!

What's the advantage to buying bitcoin from one of these machines? Is it strictly a convenience thing or what?  
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:36:12
I'm about to take this path.. I got into it trying To explain to my parents that they don't actually know anything about the technology and that they are on the side of fear and speculation, it ended with my mom saying you can't trust things on the internet...
Very poor convo and I'm not like a 15 year old high school student, I'm 20 and capable of very smart conversations with people but when it comes to things that people don't understand, especially if it involves money, egos kick in big. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:38:54
It seems to me, even though most of these guys are passed the "Scam" phase, they don't actually know anything about the coins. Originally like in 2010 and a bit after it was a perfectly logical thing to think that it could be a scam, people made absurd amounts of money (so they said) in very short amounts of time. 7 years later it seems like these professionals still look at it like "people are making lots of money, if people are making money and we don t control it it's fake" but they skip over the entire side of bitcoin that's important, it's not just a potential currency it's an ideology that's spreading. Not to mention it has been proven that people have been able to buy bitcoin, access the exchange, increase there number of bitcoins through trade and then switch there bitcoins back into fiat currency (I know this is obvious but it seems to me that these professionals don't see that the fact that I can take a bitcoin and some one will pay me thousands for it gives it VALUE) If you are a financial professional it makes no sense to ignore something that has become a resource to many people, most of these people unfortunately have a lot to lose if they actually admit bitcoin could go as far as people want it too, but you can't look at these guys and tell me the are educated on this...
Edit: Hell I'm barely aware of all that goes on with bitcoin and I spend hours a day on it... these guys probably can't be bothered to pick up a book
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:35:54
I mean part of it. But you can’t tell me bitcoin can’t be complex.
Edit: plus how many things in the world is easy to understand but people still don’t get it
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:11:05
That’s what I was thinking, you WANT bitcoin to be regulated by the US Gov’t?

I was waiting for him to get decked in the face by a tree branch or something, would be more realistic 
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:32:44
Why would that be surprising? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:30:05
Man what... he created the future... he created a platform for people to do what they so choose... people can use the platform and do great things... and if you buy into the ideology of bitcoin, (which you should if you use this sub) then he’s created the possibility of overthrowing a corrupt system that people have been trying to fix forever... just like any inventor making a product, a need was addressed and this time something was created so strong, it could someday fix the unfixable. If that happened a plunging economy could be reversed and even though that hasn’t come close to happening, satoshi created some that virtually can effect anyone. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:08:17
This^ exactly what I was thinking while we were riding high. “This is how it’s going to happen? We just go up?” Of course not, it will run its course just like always but will forever be changing due to the increasing inference from exterior entities

a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority.
absence of government and absolute freedom of the individual, regarded as a political ideal.
This could be the dumbest thread but... yes by definition you could argue anarchy represents the freedom of every individual.. but you can’t seriously tell me that in a world with out rules, you wouldn’t have leaders emerge taking control of submissive people. Yes in an anarchy state anyone could just decide they want to kill you just for shits. Enough with this bullshit

I recently tried taking cash out of an bitcoin atm, my coins never finished processing and I have to go back to the mall today to get my money but if it works then I will still be happy with the fact there is a way to get cash in my hands from bitcoin! But I agree they pay a bit lower for bitcoin so I assume they charge more and probably lots of network fees
@_date: 2018-07-08 03:27:36
Nice water bottle OP
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:08:25
If anything to me, being under the curve suggests that we will go over it next bull run 
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:13:17
I agree. There is reason to think bitcoin could keep going up!
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:10:49
The entire thought process behind creating bitcoin was that at one point it could be used by all as a single currency so I’m pretty sure people think it’s possible...
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:32:15
But do men or woman invest more USD? Do men Or women spend more USD? The answer is probably men, the ladder question maybe closer margins. 
I really hate things like this why would gender have anything to do with investment decisions? Especially something like bitcoin. I’m currently taking a finance class that is covering the stock market, the class I am in has around 7 males to about 15 females. The class HIGHLY ENCOURAGES YOU TO TAKE RISKY VENTURES with a small part of your portfolio however the class only teaches you about buying bonds and stocks. Bitcoin is not included and the small mentions by my prof here and there are mostly examples of volatility. The point I’m making is if bitcoin isn’t being taught as a mainstream investment opportunity in the general business courses. Yes they are starting to add specific classes but even still the only way one will obtain bitcoin is by choosing with there own freewill to invest time and money into it. No one can make you buy it, so whoever owns it, owns it. That’s just based on my own life experiences anyways.
