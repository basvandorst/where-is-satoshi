When your bank account gets accessed due to a skimmer, the bank typically covers the losses. With Bitcoin there is no third party to cover such losses.

Wow 10%. CAVIRTEX charges the highest fees of any bitcoin ATM in the country. Highway robbery if you ask me. Although I guess that's better than their usual tactic of actual theft from clients and investors.

I can't believe anyone still uses CAVirtex. I switched to Quadrigacx earlier this year, and am confident that it was the best decision that I've made when it comes to Bitcoin. 
Why anyone would continue using CAVirtex when they have a history of holding their clients funds hostage is beyond me.

Thankfully we have multiple exchanges in Canada. 
caVirtex.com - If you want slow crappy service
QuadrigaCX.com - If you want instant deposits, tons of withdrawal options, other cool features. 
VoS - If you want a quality exchange that supports 9898498239238 altcoins.

- A 24 hour video news channel would be sweet. 
- If 24 hours is too much, at least have a one hour daily news update
- Perhaps talk shows
- Bitcoin comedy shows, like the Colbert Report
- I would also like to see some analysis on why the Bitcoin price is going and down. Right now I have to read reddit to try and deduce it from the various positive and negative news. It would be far easier if there was someone on TV to just tell me.

This site is so full of vulnerabilities its amazing. Also, is there no way to withdraw funds after you deposit them into the black hole?

As far as I know, there are 3 major exchanges in Canada. Of the three, the easiest one to use is QuadrigaCX. They have quick verification, relatively low fees, and good customer service.
VoS is also good. CAVIRTEX has a history of freezing accounts and puts a two week hold on all new accounts, so don't use them..

I'm not surprised with this. BitPay has been growing with hardly any profits, while spending a fortune on sales people. 
Who were the employees that were laid off?

That's why I like QuadrigaCX and their non-verification required options.

cavirtex doesn't let new users withdraw for 2 weeks...

Yes, buttercoin is operating illegally.

You should check out Quadriga, they are pretty good.

That pretty much leaves QuadrigaCX. Oh well, they were my favourite exchange to begin with.

That leaves QuadrigaCX in terms of Canadian Exchanges.
