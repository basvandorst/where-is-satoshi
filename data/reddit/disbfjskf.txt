Intrinsic value is arbitrary and you can easily argue that nothing exists with it.  Most people mean "practical application" when they say intrinsic value.  Bitcoin's value in practical terms is essentially nonexistent, as anyone can make bitcoin 2.0 and have it be completely identical.  Nothing about bitcoin makes it more valuable than bitcoin 2.0 other than the fact that people have faith in the price of bitcoin.
Consider gold, which has many practical applications and is scarce in nature.  No one can create a gold substitute and gold can be easily used for all the same things regardless of how others value it.  Unless a more useful and abundant gold 2.0 is found, gold will always have value.  In comparison, dollars and bitcoin are worth only what people are willing to trade for them and have no value or utility beyond being exchanged for goods and services.

Making money on stocks is absurdly easy.  Just dump your cash in S&amp;P500 and you'll get 5-10% gains.  Put it in an automated rebalancing account and you'll get 15%-20%.  Not debating what's better, but an idiot stock investor will do just fine if he invests in normal stocks.

Your comment is inane as fuck... it's only subjective insomuch as having preferential qualities is subjective.  If there are two completely identical choices but one takes less time and effort to use, it is objectively better by the standards of taking less time/effort as preferential.  You're basically just saying that having preferences is subjective so nothing that relies on preference can be objectively better because we can't guarantee everyone has the same preferences.

The currency isn't the ledger.  And even if it was, anyone can make a new ledger for free instantly.
Bitcoin and ledgers are useful.  However, they're entirely replicable and replaceable.  Bitcoin's monetary value is completely determined by what people think other people will pay for it, rather than actual value produced through use of the resource.

Probably true.  I'm considering aesthetics to be practical in this context, in the sense that gold has a practical application in improving the aesthetics of ornaments, jewelry, etc.  We can't produce an artificial gold with the same aesthetic qualities.

The 50:50 endgame assumes only 2 boxes remaining.  From 3, you remove 1.  1/3 of the time, you kill the best prize, 1/3 of the time, you kill a dud and the best prize remains on board, and 1/3 of the time, you kill a dud and the best prize remains as your selection.  Of the 2 scenarios where the prize is live, 1 has it in your selection and 1 has it on board.  50:50.

That's still more than $15k

Smart people don't store wealth in dollars - they invest in assets with intrinsic value.  Bitcoin's price is dropping because its value is almost entirely based on speculation, rather than actual scarcity or utility.
Bitcoin is a great concept for a currency and currency transaction platform.  However, it's entirely duplicable and replaceable.  People are losing money because they bought into it on an expectation that it would rise in price, knowing it wouldn't rise in value.  No surprise that they were burned for it.

It's not.  Assume 3 boxes remain in deal or no deal (1 selected, 2 on board).  There are 3 possible orientations: 0-01, 0-10, and 1-00.  In this case, 1 is the prize and the left-most position is our selection.  We remove a box from the right side.  Now the possible orientations (all equally likely) are 0-0, 0-1, 0-1, 0-0, 1-0, and 1-0. That's 2[0-0], 2[0-1], 2[1-0].  You can easily see that you are equally likely to get the prize by selecting our box or the remaining box.
Monty Hall:
0-01, 0-10, 1-00
0-1, 0-1, 1-0*
2[0-1], 1[1-0]
You are more likely get get your prize by switching.
*Technically, this should be repeated twice, but each with 1/2 weight, as it's the only outcome of the 3 where there are 2 separate boxes that can be removed.

Key word is "produce".  Bitcoin is essentially just a number in a ledger and owning it allows you decrease your number to increase another number.  Some people will pay you to do that.  It may itself be valuable because it has trade value, but unlike companies, it does not *produce* value: One Bitcoin will always represent the ability to transfer 1 Bitcoin in quantity in the ledger; One Amazon stock represents a percentage share of company ownership which produces annual revenue (value) and generally increases in asset ownership (value) over time.  You will never get dividends from Bitcoin because it is not producing value to distribute among holders.

Bitcoin does not produce (generate) value; it simply exchanges hands.  I'm not saying Bitcoin isn't produced (created).  I'm saying that:


Meaning that the coins themselves do not create anything or change in form.
And to be clear, I'm not saying that Bitcoins aren't valuable or that they don't facilitate valuable services; I'm just saying that the coins themselves do not produce anything; they will never be able to do more than move from one record on a ledger to another, unlike companies which consistently produce value by exchanging goods and services for revenue.

This is the original comment in the chain:


I am simply affirming the statement.  The point is that companies appreciate in value because they produce value.  Companies are "productive assets" that should be expected to increase in value by exchanging goods and services for revenue
Bitcoin is not a productive asset.  It does not generate value.  It may still appreciate in value through scarcity, but not through production (because the Bitcoin you own does not produce anything as it sits in the ledger).  Dollars, like Bitcoin, do not produce things or generate value; they are simply used as a medium of exchange.  No one holds their dollars expecting them to increase in value; they instead invest their dollars in productive assets.

You're taking this way out of context.  The original comment was that the digital currency known as Bitcoin (the stuff that sits in your digital wallet) is not a productive asset.  Meaning that the value owned in the ledger does not perform work by sitting there.  This was compared to stock ownership of companies, which are productive assets.  The literal only thing I'm doing is supporting that assertion.
If you want to debate that singular point, sure, we can debate it.  I commented because you seemed to disagree and I thought you would benefit from clarifying what was meant in the OP.
@_date: 2019-02-08 18:36:03
In the context of this conversation, "Bitcoin" is referring to the currency, and specifically to the currency as an investment.  Bitcoin, the currency, as an investment, is not productive.
Also, blockchain is definitely not a banking term... It's the framework that all cryptos run on.
@_date: 2019-02-07 19:51:05
I don't think we're talking about the same thing.  Literally, the only point I'm making is that stock ownership is ownership of a productive asset and Bitcoin ownership is not.  If you want to talk about ownership of blockchain infrastructure, sure, that's productive.

So you're proposing that Tesla offer a $60,000 asset for one currently valued at $7,400 on the belief that expected growth is so insufficiently priced-in that BTC will, at a minimum, 8x value over the next 2 years?  And *if* it does, they don't even cash in on the excess - they just take the $60k in cash that their product is worth?  Because it will marginally increase their number of pre-orders?  Do you understand how ludicrously terrible that gamble is?
If Tesla thought that even resembled a good idea, they'd just buy $20k in Bitcoin now instead of building your truck and take $150k+ in gains 2 years later.

He still lost millions of dollars in purchasing power that could have easily been locked in through a more stable investment.
@_date: 2019-01-29 19:14:05
He did have 1.9MM of purchasing power, though.
@_date: 2019-01-29 20:30:03
Without getting into semantics of what "purchasing power" means, he had the capacity to purchase an additional $1.5MM in assets more than he can today.  Or 1.5 million McDoubles if we want to keep fiat out of the picture.  He lost 1.5 million McDoubles in value.
@_date: 2019-01-29 19:27:30
Are you implying that Bitcoin has no purchasing power?  He had $1.9MM in purchasing power (stored in Bitcoin) reduced to $0.4MM in purchasing power (stored in Bitcoin).  No matter how you slice it, the purchasing power he had was reduced by $1.5MM.

It's the goal of a species, not individual, to reproduce.  Many species (particularly insects) have sterile offspring because the species gains most from their service rather than their reproduction.  And among humans, many people choose to adopt rather than produce offspring of their own.  Humans became a dominant species because of their social capacity and societal organization - not because they could reproduce most efficiently.
I'm not saying that your conclusion is wrong; just that it's not a logical derivation from your premise.  While the goal of life is to procreate, it's not inherently the goal of the individual.
Also, while I disagree with the extent ("more than life itself"), you can still love and trust someone that you're not procreating with and that may still be a critical desire in the human experience.
