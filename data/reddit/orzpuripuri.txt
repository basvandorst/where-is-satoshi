Haha yes I know it's all just for fun and laughs, however if it is as you say then the amount of traffic within that period might already be worth it ;)

Well I'm sorry you had to take this stunt so personally...fyi the device doesn't belong to anyone and you still see people take selfies of themselves for the world to see, you need to chill otherwise them blood pressure gonna rise to no end.
edit: by anyone i mean any of the customers who are using it, duh obviously they belong to apple/store owner, anyways jokes over move along :P

Hey glad you like it, as ml-btc mentioned that was the image I used for the wallpaper, however as I needed to be swift before getting caught by one of the countless apple geniuses constantly scouting the area... Here's what I did:
1. Search for bitcoin iPad wallpaper and save that image to photos from the first page of Google images on all ipads.
2. Set wallaper to lockscreen only on all ipads 
3. Switch off all ipads.
4. Switch back on all ipads and as long as you calculate you exit route you will end with last iPad near the entrance and gtfo haha

well that's what i meant when i brought up the analogy with the other customers, obviously it belongs to apple ffs people need everything spelt out to them these days even when it's so blatantly obviously

i know there's been a few links which refers to josph wang's comments on quora, its great that he has taken the time to publish a proper article on the matter to restore faith. hopefully this clears up some of the biased opinions some mainstream journals have been publishing using the word 'banned' to their advantage.
