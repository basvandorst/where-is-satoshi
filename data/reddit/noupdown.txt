Wait, wasn't bitcoin at one time mostly mined in China as well? They can both be "taken down" if enough collusion occurs. I don't see how Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin differ here...

This is the same thing that LBC has, so this exact scenario could also end up like this if you use bisq or any arbitrator.

How will this work? I take it if they use a platform provider then they Starbucks won't be on the hook to wait for confirmations? An attacker could just double-spend at starbucks anytime then. I suppose this is an assumed loss just like merchants do nowadays for stolen merchandise - they assume this will happen.

Then that defeats the entire advantage of LBC. What type of ID do they require?
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:12:55
Exchanges dealing in fiat require identification. LBC does not. That is why people go there. What has happened in this case is a seller sold small amounts and then exit scammed when enough ratings were achieved.

Well, this subreddit is almost entirely filled with memes. I think this has more to say about the quality of this particular subreddit. Plenty of other quality crypto avenues out there

That is, until a 51% attack is made and potentially wrecks havoc. The collusion of the miners has me worried.

How much is the fee tho?

The threat of btc demise will surely speed that implementation if no one can actually use it without a $10 fee.

I'm not sure if you typed this response on drugs or not to the OP, but I had to point out this glaring mistake: 


Google search volatile and then plot the price of USD compared to any other currency and then plot BTC. You will notice how BTC value has risen and fallen in drastic swings. This means it's volatile and apt to change. 
Your other arguments are assuming BTC goes up forever due to its deflarionary characteristics and is therefore better and more liquid and safe and secure, but all of this could come crashing down if the price of BTC falls or if the future forks goes terrible plus a bunch of other scenarios. Anyone could make a  deflationary commodity, it doesn't make it necessarily garnish value over time

My local one is 12% fee. No idea who would use these. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 00:49:53
How much was the transaction fee though? I have to pay an additional ~$8 to use any of my BTC. I'd rather just stick to use a CC for now.  
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:27:06


But it does. The whole point of btc is to be a new currency. There is no value in btc or in any coin altogether if it's not being adopted and being used.

Sounds like a great way to offload a large payment without having to convert it to fiat.

3rd option: It bounces its way all the way down to $0 or just a few hundred $ and stays there for 5+ years.

I'm thinking it will drop to at least 2600 and then perhaps 900 if more people get spooked. I just hope the drop is quick so bitcoin can then be back on its recovery course. The Chinese will be bleeding the market until their exchanges close on Sept 30th.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:30:47
Yes, I too think that any dip below $1k will invoke fear in people and the faith in crypto currency may take a long time to resurface again. We are only 5 trading days away from breaching &lt;$1k given a -20% return for each day. 
Dipping farther below under 1k will take a long time simply because large percentage decreases don't move the dollar as much as it used to when its value was in the thousands.

It's going lower than that. It was only 1k a few months ago.

If they shutdown the large Chinese miners, new ones will take their place elsewhere. You can see this same phenomenon anytime there is money to be made. Just look at what happens when a large drug cartel or empire collapses.

Why not just spell out the seed using only 4 characters for each word then? My guess is that the wallets make some words longer that are more common so they are easier for memorization?

Sitting on a loss for years takes guts. I'd wager not many people understand this and will therefore easily dismiss this tactic of finally selling for a profit as being an idiot when in fact I can totally relate and understand. It bitcoin were to fall to $100 again, all of the so-called "holders" would look foolish for not selling now or even when you finally sold.

I've noticed that the transaction includes two outputs. One going to the intended recipient of a few dollars, and then the remaining much larger sum going back to my wallet. If this Stat takes simply adds both outputs, then it would look like I spend thousands of bitcoin daily, when in fact it's just a few dollars. Therefore, I fell that these stats of"95 million USD worth of transactions were made" are blatantly false

Bitcoin already has segwit active. Segwit2x is a misnomer. Anyone can create their own fork and use it themselves. Since most users don't want to use the new split, it will just die out and turn into another dead altcoin

I thought it comical that Alexander and Roger Clark all went to Thailand in hopes of evading the US authorities. Why not go to a country where the US has no extradition policy? Honestly, I would have also committed suicide if I were Alexander considering he was doomed to a small cell 23hrs a day in a US prison. What kind of life is that? Sometimes it's best to move on.
