And if you plot it on a double log scale, the line looks even flatter!

I haven't heard about a new protocol. Can you link me to it?

In twenty years you will be quoted on this.

Can't you ask your local government to send you a proof of residence? If there are no further options, maybe you van contact Bitstamp, to ask what you can do to prove your address. 
As for the scanner, maybe you can ask a neighbour or a local library. You could even take a picture of the document and send that.

If I were you, I'd just print out the digital personbevis and scan that, or take a photo of it. 
If it looks the same, the people of Bitstamp won't know the difference.
In this time and age, it is indeed pretty ridiculous that they don't accept electronic bills or statements.

I hope PayPal does, because I hate PayPal, but it would be good for Bitcoin.

I have one for my DnD group:  
I also have an address without numbers (except for the first 1 of course).  
 Does that count?

It was randomly generated. It turns out the chance to get an adress like this is about 0,1%. Way larger than I imagined.
