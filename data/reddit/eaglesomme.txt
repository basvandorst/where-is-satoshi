I have learnt in the cryptocurrency sphere there is no limit to the extent of some peoples stupidity.
Also I have found that you can categorise anyone into one of two categories, people that think they know what they are talking about and people that actually know what they are talking about.

It's also a lot easier to identify a dip in retrospect that it is at the time. But I totally agree with you, almost everyone chickens out and forgets the fundamentals. E.g. Buy low sell high. I think this is partially the blame of the current uncertainty, but mostly the fault of stupidity. I like to always remember that there's no point celebrating that the price is going up, if you didn't buy the coin when it was at a low.

A hardware wallet such as the Ledger Nano S is the safest and most secure way to store your valuable BTC. Best not to store on your phone as it could get stolen or broken easily.

It makes sense David is Satoshi Nakamoto. It would explain Satoshis disappearance well.

Buy low sell high. You bought low, just make sure you sell high.
