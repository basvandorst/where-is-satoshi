Yes.  And I was there looking at Breadwallet while it was still saying "Verified, waiting for confirmation" too.

So I did find something in the cache.   And I am not sure what it is.   But its about 500 lines of text with this at the top:
It is inside of a cached URL for bitaddress.org

Followed by several hundred lines of this type of thing:

(I've repeated the same line here to give you an idea how it looks)
Edit:  Was able to restore the page using nothing but the cache (incredible) using this tool:     
But unfortunately the resulting HTML file also reverted me back to the main screen where you swipe around your mouse for awhile first.   
On the plus side, I can sell a bunch of BCH and hopefully recover all my BTC.

When I saw.

Use Breadwallet if you have an iPhone.

This begs an important question. Is it illegal for me to just exchange BTC for USD with someone like this?
It would benefit both of us, and after all, bitcoin is supposed to be peer-to-peer.
I don't see any reason why this guy has to pay crazy fees at an ATM when there are plenty of people who are interested in selling "at cost" without any mark up whatsoever.
I know local bitcoins kind-of does this, but they charge ridiculous surplus fees. 
I wouldn't do that. If I just want to sell some and get the cash, problem-solved for both of us right?
You'd probably have to use PayPal to transfer the USD, and an escrow or something, but is something like this illegal?

Sucks.  Video doesn't work on iPhone.  Plays commercial then switches to next video on tax reform.

Well there's also this from not too long ago:  
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:33:13
Have a niche health site / community site that does about 400,000 uniques a month, 2m pageviews a month, mailing list of about 65,000 and roughly $1,000 a day in sales.  Been around for 18 years and has about 70,000 forum members with 700,000 pages of content. 
Would love to offload it for Bitcoin.  I'm burned out on it after 18 years to be honest.  Great cash cow waiting to be monetized by some younger blood.

He's being superstitious.
