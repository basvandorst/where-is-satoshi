I haven't invested in bitcoin myself ever but I have been following it since it was $11 and following it closely since it hit $100. I was planning on finally going in big (for me, over $10,000) right before 2x but then I woke up to see the price skyrocketing. I then checked and saw the 2x was called off but at this point the price had already gone from $7200 to $7800 and I called off knowing that some sort of pump and dump was happening. Thankful that I didn't go in.

Makes sense. I would still feel sus considering amex would probably look into it and stripe would most definitely hand over your info to them.

I'm not understanding your point at all. If I walk into the jewelry store with an ounce of gold they will pay me usd or store credit 100% of the time. That's on top of how gold has fashion uses and is one of the best semi conductors in use today for electronics.

If the cards are stolen then depositing the funds into your own debit card account using stripe would be dumbest possible way to spend the funds.

So stolen credit card -&gt; stripe -&gt; your bank -&gt; amex gift cards -&gt; buy crypto?
Still seems like you're ratting yourself out lol
or do you mean stolen card -&gt; amex gift card -&gt; crypto. That would make sense but then why bring up stripe.
