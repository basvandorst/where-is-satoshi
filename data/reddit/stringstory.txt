hi there, 
My name is Suzanne, I just learnt about Bitcoin. 
The first time I used Bitcoin was by raising funds for Nepal on  changetip is like a basic 101 to BTC. 😁
On a mental note, I feel like I'm tripping out using reddit. It's like I'm delving into a massive rabbit hole.

Thank you for the tip (it's being redirected to RedCross)

Good advice  
Most of the population don't understand how email or even money and how it works. The current phase of Bitcoin is very much in the education part. 
As a geek who went down the black hole, I noticed that there are plenty of startups who want to utilise the bitcoin/blockchain. I don't need to part of the technical aspect and there is massive gap in contextualising the conversation to the every day.  
Now it's being recognised as a commodity, and there's plenty room for growth. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:39:15
Lol! I feel like Alice. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 13:12:26
Woah, more gold shops than banks.
There's benefits in being the intangiable - like you don't have to carry the weight of $ over borders. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 04:02:19
I understand that Bitcoin is a way of storing value as a currency, but I'm really interested to see if it can be utilised more as an experience. 
Beyond the scope of $$ what else can btc be used for? 
@_date: 2015-10-25 04:11:30
than counter-argue the nonsense part of the question. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 12:44:49
What is the likely demand for Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-10-24 09:50:08
Interestingly, I've noticed a shift in language too, banks use the word blockchain.
The thing is blockchain technology cannot exist without bitcoin and vice versa. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:50:49
the ones I rock up to, only accept cash! That's even worse ... :| 
@_date: 2015-10-25 04:07:09
THIS IS TRUE!
we follow the consensus and almost bound by the rules set by society. So, from all the discussion that came forth here... I'm really surprised that the large amount of the discussion is treating bitcoin as a monetary value.... 
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:51:32
OMG, this sounds like a fun challenge. 
So how did it go? 
@_date: 2015-10-24 12:49:32
It depends which country your in, bartering system still exists.
Actually, even in 1st world countries, creatives used batering system. Not for women but for a box of beers.
Gold has scarcity, so does Bitcoin?! Though a tangent thought its derative nature can keep going and going and going and going and going.... 
@_date: 2015-10-24 11:14:05
what is the value of gold? 
@_date: 2015-10-24 11:27:08
Nice point here.
Do you mind clarifying? 
@_date: 2015-10-24 07:31:10
Haha, i live in the city too. I think I will call them first to see if it possible, but appreciate the brainstorm idea. 
Airbitz is a wallet that has a bitcoin directory.
My first bitcoin purchase was buying a beer.

Sounds  like a story about my Grandma, she stores a ton of cash in her mattress that it becomes the cushion for the bed. 
Still, why do the government body keep on printing cash then?
Also, what personal value or benefit do you use BTC for? 
@_date: 2015-10-24 13:13:05
What do you think are the personal benefits of using bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-10-24 15:16:38
Most everyday consumer don't even know how money works, they only care how quick and easy it is.
Most don't even know how emails work, but use it everyday. Same similar story with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:51:09
Maybe I have to move to the US. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 04:08:43
lol, he looks far more comfortable than me when I slept on such a bed. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 15:24:34
Buy in person or find a Bitcoin trader. There's also nothing to stop minors from trading either (or am I wrong in this regard?!)
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:50:18
one day there's going to be a future where we will buy fried chicken with bitcoin (and where no one will respond like bitcoin is monopoly money)
@_date: 2015-10-25 04:05:37
Value is subjective.
If we replaced the word 'value' as a benefit, how does using bitcoin as a technology be a benefit to the user/consumer?
yes if we follow the trend of money, the next follow on is being a cashless economy. 
Also, while 21M is expected to be capped, it still is a derative, likely they will be something smaller than satoshi. 
Yes, it is Suzanne... (is it weird that you know me but I dont know who this is?) 
@_date: 2015-10-24 11:14:53
so, why do you think we place value in money or USD? 
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:52:36
What's the point in doing that? I mean its about seeing if we can bring bitcoin to the mainstream.
Wouldn't it be awesome, we talk in bits instead of dollars.
@_date: 2015-10-14 01:20:33
is foodler available in Australia? 
@_date: 2015-10-25 04:10:04
inherent value = use value. 
interesting that you used water, in certain parts of the world that's a far more valuable commodity. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:50:15
What a shame. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 04:01:13
does that mean that we have to follow suit? 
@_date: 2015-10-25 04:08:13
I'm sorta new at reddit and I think I've missed a beat. Who is OP? 
@_date: 2015-10-24 13:15:35
o dear, I'm getting in the spirit of reddit!! aren't I? :p
Vietnam. layers and layers of cash, I even slept on top of it. It's not comfortable at all, even knowing that you can sleep and guard doesn't provide any basic comfort :|
@_date: 2015-10-24 15:14:30
my Vietnamese relatives did turn them into jewellery and gold. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 12:43:08
I'm surprised no one brought up the technology that Bitcoin is built top, which is the blockchain. 
so far, the discussion on this reddit is built on the premise of monetary value. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 12:44:16
If only Bitcoin can talk...
