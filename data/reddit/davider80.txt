That article got me scared about bitcoin. Argh.

I noticed that every time I load the page the popup "TRACK YOUR PROFITS/LOSSES...." keep coming up. This happens in Chrome and Safari and it's a bit annoying.

Q: how many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?
A: none, that’s a hardware problem

You are reminding me the epic bitcoinbillionaire :D

Don't mention that. Because of this article I decided not buy bitcoins in 2011 and I forgot them until last bubble. Sigh. Still mad at them. :-/

That's great! Do you plan to other currency like litecoins? Thank you!
@_date: 2013-05-10 18:28:01
LOL, edited, thank you. Maybe I'm not good enough with numbers to play with bitcoins! :-P

This also is great:
I can't believe that almost 1BTC was sent there.

You are right, I followed exactly the Adafruit guide. It works like a charm.

It's a bit late. I'didn't got in BTC in late 2011 because of their  negative article "The rise and fall of Bitcoin". I'm still mad at them.

Me too, mining @ 1GH/s with a Raspberry + Eruptor just for the fun. Proud owner of self mined 0.1 BTC ;-)

Arghh. This is even worse! :-/
