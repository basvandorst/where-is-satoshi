Not true. Already existing coal-fired power plants burning dirty brown coal are cheaper and less intermittent. Also, no significant amounts of new hydro can be built so if hydro energy is spent on bitcoin mining, it means it cannot be spent on other uses and has to be substituted with non-hydro electricity.
Here's a decent source.

Conveniently enough rural China has also has plenty of coal-fired power plants burning cheap coal. It makes absolutely no sense to claim China builds expensive hydro dams in places where it cannot utilize the power unless a bitcoin mine happens to spring up.

He's counting change as well. The real value is about 10% of what he's reporting.
@_date: 2018-09-15 19:06:47
Bitpay reported about $1B in 2017, so if you believe their numbers, and fix OP's numbers to only include the sent BTC and not the change, then less than 10% of total bitcoin transaction volume is used for buying goods and services.

Congratulations, you're a prisoner.

Bitcoin is burning about 5 GW of electricity 24/7, most of it coming from fossil fuels. I don't think 36 MW of wind power in some distant undefined future is going to offset it much.
@_date: 2018-09-27 02:16:10


No it isn't. It's been more or less like this as long as the US has existed.
@_date: 2018-09-16 23:19:24
According to blockchain.info $500B in bitcoin was sent over the last year, 10% of that is $50B. 
I'm pretty sure Bitpay has more than 1/50 of the bitcoin goods and services market cornered. I was being super generous.

On closer inspection you're the weirdo.
@_date: 2018-08-31 09:39:51
Yes, just like you when you for some weird reason were trying to make it sound like the government is guaranteeing a 7% annual return on investments.
@_date: 2018-08-02 13:15:36
Yes if we carefully cherry pick the data we can make it support our cause! It must be done!

1. Luckily both are covered by existing law.
2. Lol nope
3. Bitcoin is no more and no less a real currency than Paycoin, or Flooz, or tulips. Maybe they should be exempt too.

Also completely irrelevant.

If they're educated they'll already know bitcoin is a scam and they won't let the kid buy into it.

Thanks, I feel ok now. Maybe we can mobilize all Australian bitcoiners to visit that airport and make a few BTC transactions so it'd look better?

Do you think kids are somehow unable to poison their customers with contaminated lemonade?
@_date: 2018-08-22 11:56:17
There will be no legal action, the cops will just tell the parents to put a stop to it and be less dumb in the future. Kids can have perfectly happy childhoods without running lemonade stands. I bet in like 90% of the cases the idea comes from the parents anyway.

Hal Finney was an expert in computer science, I bet it boosted the Dunning-Kruger effect when he dove into a field he was not familiar with, resulting in these weird, clearly incorrect statements about economics.

Perhaps Coinbase doesn't care about your opinions but is trying to maximize shareholder profit as they see fit?
Perhaps BCH simply underlines the point that bitcoin has no real scarcity and can be functionally cloned just like that?
@_date: 2018-07-03 18:33:32


In *crypto assets*, that means that they've already bought the cryptos and are now just transferring them into a custodial wallet. Nothing will be bought. There will be no price boost.

The current US income tax was introduced in 1913. The gold standard was abolished in 1933. A good 20-year overlap.
