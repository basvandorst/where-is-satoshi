Hi Madman. Could you please send me your account # / support ticket # ? I don't have any access to customer service files, but shall try to figure out what's going on.

Hello all. We just want to reiterate that this is not a “stop” but a temporary pause so that we can implement a proper fix to the problem. To analogize, not pausing withdrawals would be like trying to fix a car while going 120mph down the highway. The issue merely compounds on itself. This pause is clearly not ideal, but it will lead to a better outcome than doing otherwise. We’re very sorry for the inconvenience.

Hi there. Sorry to hear you're having troubles. I'm not familiar with your particular issue, but shall try my best to figure out what's going on. Will shoot you a PM with my email address and let's sort this out.  
@_date: 2013-05-02 03:37:29
Dear Pyro919. Thank you for putting up this post. Could you please PM us your account details so that we can take a deeper look? Many thanks. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:18:48
oops. Sorry about that. thanks! Moving too fast.

Absolutely not true. We do not operate a fractional reserve exchange. 100% of deposits and Bitcoins are accounted for at all times. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:10:53
That's great to hear. We are always looking for new options and help making Mt. Gox and bitcoin succeed. Please email us at contact
Thanks for your offer.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:47:07
Yes, within this year. We're not satisfied with what we have now, but we don't want to touch it ATM.

Hi. Mt. Gox here. We addressed this in our AMA:
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:14:50
The communications from the liquidator wrongly creates an impression that we are withholding information and account access without any proper lawful basis and otherwise failing to co-operate with the liquidator.  To the contrary, we have communicated our willingness to co-operate with the liquidators of Bitcoinica LP (In Liquidation) as far as we can lawfully do so.  
Before we can release the confidential and highly sensitive information sought by the liquidators, they must first provide certain basic verificatory evidence to establish that they are entitled to the information. So far, they have not.

A: We are working on a new secure trading infrastructure centered around a new trade engine we have developed that will ensure that even if our data center loses internet connectivity, mtgox.com will still stay up and available


A: If possible, we'd like to avoid this. We already had various kill circuits set to avoid similar things in the past, but now we are working on new solutions. The more additional security features we put in, the more lag that would result, so we are always looking for the optimum balance of security features and speed.


A: We are able to, and of course we are and will continue to investigate. Of course, this is a very difficult and time consuming process, and is not guaranteed to succeed in finding the culprits, but nevertheless we will try. We are putting more of our efforts into making sure that this does not happen in the future. Rest assured, our priority is to make sure that all transactions proceed smoothly.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:09:02
That's a good question. Bitcoin is an unregulated market, and as such there is nobody to define market rules. Is it our job to put restrictions on the trading or not? It's something we've been pondering for a long time. We believe Bitcoin market should be free as much as possible without killing opportunities for others
It sounds rough....but we cannot stop people from panic selling. We are not bitcoin, we are an exchange. We are one part of the equation, but everyone is responsible in some way. We believe in bitcoin, and that's why we're here today. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:05:10
"Yeah, that's why I'm here. Jeez."

@_date: 2013-04-12 12:45:54
No. We have a company policy that forbids employees (contractually) from trading on the exchange
@_date: 2013-04-26 08:00:32
Thanks for your comments Stoatham. We're certainly aware of areas where we need to improve. Doubling our support staff should help for sure, but we're certainly looking beyond that as well. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:36:05


We were scheduled to launch a new cryptocurrency this week, but recent events have taken precedent. We're looking at 1~2 weeks now, but it will happen. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:30:03


Looking forward to hearing from you ;-)
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:10:04
The main purpose of the cool down period was to upgrade our hardware. We do not have a plan to have a cool down period again. Our intention is to interfere as little as possible and to let the free market run its course.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:48:06
Yes we are hiring high-level developers mostly, but if you think you can help, please get in touch at contact
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:38:47
In the next 2~3 weeks. DDos obviously is not helping matters.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:46:12
We cannot disclose details, but we have some ideas. 
@_date: 2013-06-21 13:50:57
Thanks. Scary user name.
@_date: 2013-04-26 06:16:35
Hi Stoatham. Apologies for the confusion on this matter. Would you be so kind as to PM me your account details? Then we can send this directly over to the AML team to figure out what has happened. We've already contacted them regarding the matter, so we're looking forward to hearing from you.
Many thanks,
Mt. Gox Team

We'd like to draw attention to this reddit post as well:
This was due to the server losing connectivity due to the DDos, and not something we did on our end. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:52:18
Upgrading computer systems means ordering more servers (2 weeks timeframe), setting up (1 day), load testing (2 weeks) and deployment (1 day). It's a process that can take up to one month in total. 
Re:  We are now enforcing new rules for people placing large amounts of trades in order to reduce risks of lag
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:59:39
Please keep in mind that we are not native English speakers, and that was a poor choice of words. The "success" is in the quick uptake of bitcoin most of all. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:59:36
How many new accounts are you getting at the moment?
**Before the DDOS 20000 day.** 
How long is the verification queue?
**We currently have a 2-week backlog.**
Is the verification queue mainly new accounts?
**95% are new accounts**
Are you doing anything to try to stop people leaving you after the events of the last few days?
**We offered free trades for 48 hours just as a small gesture to say sorry. This is a free market, so what we can focus on is trying to improve our services so that people want to use us: We have a lot of new services coming up, including more local presence to allow people to deposit and withdraw faster and cheaper.**
What is your server/database setup like?	
**We can’t give out details on this.** 
You have made some changes to your trading engine, but do you have any more long term plans that can't be delivered soon, but are in the pipelines?
**Yes, the UI will be redesigned. New trading options will be offered. And of course, we are working on making the system faster.**
A high frequency trader recently posted on reddit and said that he was able to make a deal with you for extremely low exchange fees in order to do high frequency trades, is this legit?
**No, that is not true.**
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:55:36
Employees are prohibited to trade on Mt Gox, but are allowed to have BTC. 
Obviously there's no insider trading law re: BTC, but we have a responsibility as the largest exchange to enforce this internally, and we do. 
We cannot forbid staff from owning or trading BTC personally any more than a bank would prohibit employees from owning cash or to bank elsewhere.
tl;dr It would be stupid if our staff could not enjoy the beauty of bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:20:07
Our system was designed to handle 2~3x our normal load, but now we're experiencing 10x the amount, which was difficult to prepare for (it takes weeks) with the sudden new accounts. 
We have two problems: the DDos and volume related to new accounts. The trade engine is capable of accepting much more of a load. Within 2~3 weeks we will completely rewrite the trade engine, in the meantime we shut down the system today and installed a new server with the current trade engine. Of course, if we didn't have DDos everything would be fine, so now we're dealing with two issues at once.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:45:31
We would prefer that the duck-sized horses be divisible to 8 decimal places.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:22:44
We have 12 in the office (programmers, accounting, support, etc) and 22 external staff for support and account verification.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:24:28
NO. Everything is accounted for (BTC and money). Fractional reserve is absolutely against our principles. In fact 90~95% of BTC are held in cold storage.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:41:45
This is a great question. Customers come to us, and we provide them services. Yes, we are the biggest exchange, but compared to the entire BTC economy we are SMALL. Due to our size as an exchange we have come to be perceived as bitcoin, but we are NOT bitcoin! 
We are an exchange. For every sale there is a buyer, and vice-versa. We only facilitate this exchange, but we do understand our important role in the economy.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:17:53
Thanks for participating! Sorry if this is late getting to you.
So, lag is a difficult one because it can change a lot and FAST. However, we do know that we need to communicate better, and this is a priority for capable hands 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:06:31
Cloud solutions are not meant for large scale operations such as trading systems, and are not the best solution for facing such a DDos attack. We are big in the bitcoin world, but compared to a Facebook or a Google or even a bank we are too small and don't have access to their technology
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:42:35
The beautiful cherry blossoms are gone, and then it got cold again. Go figure.

Basically because by naming them it makes our job harder because they will move to protect themselves.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:33:29


We are investigating this possibility, but we are not certain. It's unlikely because we have such a huge rise in accounts, but the percentage of new users that submit documentation for verification is basically the same. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:12:11
We are working on a new trading engine and we have been working on it for months. It will be up in the next 2/3 weeks.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:16:26
Yes, our design needs improvement... but we are working on a new page design. We are constantly updating our Facebook and Twitter accounts, so please check there for the latest updates.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:12:31
We have done so and are working with them now. We appreciate the offer to help, especially if you are in Tokyo!
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:56:02
We are considering this, but implementing it will have consequences on system as a whole so we want to make sure it's the correct method.
@_date: 2013-06-17 10:43:19
Deleted the duplicate post we put up. Just FYI, we're not trying to troll the G8 or get in anyone's face, but get good information about Bitcoin in front of decision makers. Hope you like the ad!
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:49:19
We absolutely understand this. The fact is that we are programmers and engineers, not PR guys, and we are still building out our capabilities beyond technology and into servicing our customers better. So, yes, we're moving on this now and have secured help. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:02:54
The thing is...  .01 transactions are bitcoins! Depending on the exchange value that can be a lot of money to people.
