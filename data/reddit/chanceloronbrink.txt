Academic papers tend to be more polished than casual e-mails, but the discrepancy becomes glaring when one reads the posts of "real" Satoshi at Bitcointalk and Cryptography mailing list. For example this:
Satoshi just doesn't make grammatical mistakes in his emails, and I don't think he spent hours of polishing them either.
I'm sure Newsweek will pretty soon regret publishing this crock.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:16:02
Here are list of all the times when Satoshi posted on bitcointalk:
With one exception, he never posted between 06.42 UTC and 12.43. Presumably he was sleeping at the time.
Translated to Los Angeles time (UTC - 8) this would mean he was sleeping between 22.42 and 04.43. The article states that this fellow went to sleep later than the other family members and was up earlier. So if the family members retired to sleep at 21.00 or so, this is consistent.
However, I find it extremely hard to believe that the same hand wrote both those Amazon reviews and the bitcoin whitepaper.

I don't think English is his first language. Rather I believe his English is is gleaned from reading technical literature. The rarity of colloquialism and humor in his writings reinforces this impression. Also, the alternative UK/American spellings like favor/favour signify to me that he did not have bias in either way.

All the bitcoins you have are actually little computer programs. The bitcoins in your wallet belong to you, because your address is coded into them. 
The private key is needed to move the bitcoins to some other address. In this sense the address is like a lock that can be opened with the key.
When you want to send bitcoins to someone else, you have to sign them. That means that you use the private key, and the little program in the coins checks that your key is associated with the address that is coded into it. Then it can overwrite it with a new address, that belongs to the person you are sending coin.
The network does not need to know the private key. All it sees that the coins are being transferred, and everybody knows that the little program in the coins has already checked that your private key has been used. Because otherwise your coins would not be moving!

I'd say he was (is?) a visionary who could combine many existing strands of thought and solutions to come up with something totally new. His genius wasn't in coming up with entirely original findings, but in ability to step back and see clearly what had already been done, and what possibilities were inherent in the cryptographic landscape.

The original Bitcoin client is not an implementation of the ideas in the whitepaper, it is the other way round. He wrote the code first in order to prove to himself that his vision was workable and then wrote the paper as an explanation of what the code does and what problem it solves.  Next he worked some more on the code and eventually announced the release of 0.1 version on the Cryptography mailing list, where he had published the whitepaper a few months earlier.
The overall impression I get from the organization of the source code is that of enthusiastic young game programmer. It is Windows-only, is not particularly security-conscious and starts to go off to tangential directions (there is even an implementation of an online marketplace). In the resource section there is the first Bitcoin icon: a gold coin with the letters BC on it. It is only when you zero in to individual classes that the code becomes economical and elegant and bears the stamp of a truly acute mind.
Based on these observations, I conjecture that he was/isn't an IT professional. Based on his choice of tools I doubt his field isn't computer science either, as he does not seem to know unix/linux or Java. Possibly he has studied theory of computation and/or discrete mathematics and has come to cryptography via that route. 
And the possibility that he is very very gifted amateur cannot be discounted either.

It is a method of distribution based on BTC allocation. So, yes, it would float afterward in the sense that btc holders would vote on the value of the altcoin by either dumping or holding the coins.

Being technically innovative isn't everything. One of the most innovative coins right now is Huntercoin, a fork of Namecoin recast as RPG game, yet its price is going down to the roof? Why? Lack of marketing, lack of community. Contrast this with a scrypt clone like Dogecoin that whipped up a large user base overnight and has introduced large amounts of people to cryptocurrency.
But some people will remain curmudgeons no matter what. "Here's a technical innovation: a cpu-mineable coin"

I think that the first two arguments sort of contradict each other. If Bitcoin is evaluated solely by its merits, then isn't the  founder's background irrelevant? In totally analogous vein, one could argue that poorly run exchanges and scandals are harmful for Bitcoin... but actually, in the long run the usefulness of the system will prevail over  public perception. 
That being said, I guess Satoshi's decision to recede from public view was influenced by a very similar train of thought. He probably wanted to avoid becoming Mr. Bitcoin, but ended up becoming the Bitcoin God.
@_date: 2014-03-07 10:03:12
Those previous attempts of guesswork were entirely contained in web pages and not one of them generated such a media frenzy. Satoshi - who  quite possibly is Japanese - evidently felt the need to do something to stop the harassment of a guy who doesn't know the first thing about Bitcoin.

Very, very weighty and comprehensive. I hope Newsweek is listening.
What I find remarkable, however is that ~~a core bitcoin dev~~ he seems so sure that the surprise message at p2p ning site was made by Satoshi himself. Has this been somehow verified, and if it is, why is p2p foundation so silent? I'm still waiting for that public announcement...

The rising altcoin trend is "community coins"... coins made for ethnic groups, followers of certain band, internet forums etc. There are many many niches. Since the "main feature" of these kind of coins is social and not technical, I don't see the point of duplicating them on sidechain.
Bottom-line: only technically innovative coins can be copied on sidechain which may lead to devs abandoning open source.

This is correct, and therefore we should be looking into ways to make hard-coded limits obsolete and the quantities they control subject to market forces. 
This is actually the focus of the Unlimited project. The max block size is just most significant of these centrally planned limits and in need of acute attention.
@_date: 2016-01-27 07:17:21


Ok let's then push the block size limit down even more. Scarcity is good!

In that case I suppose that would be a separate "permissioned ledger" that is subject to a regulation right from the get go.

@_date: 2016-03-01 11:49:48
Since on Ethereum contracts run on the blockchain, and contracts can call other contracts means that there has to be a consequential order of execution at all times and a consensus about that order. Now as the network scales up, the challenge to honor these requirements is far from trivial, and may very well pale Bitcoin's scalability problems in comparison. 
Ethereum does have pretty smart devs, and they may find their way around these looming issues, but do not make the mistake of thinking it will be all dancing and roses.

In my experience the reason is often tied to the convenience of subscribing to a web wallet service. I've never heard anyone say "I tried to run a node, but blocks took so long time to validate, I was discouraged".
The answer to the other points is : Xtreme Thinblocks.
@_date: 2016-03-10 08:02:38
Very interesting piece.
What left me scratching my head is that it is argued there that validation is intimately connected with the decentralization "strength", but the "economic decentralization equation" given there is only concerned with recipients and receipts, ie. trades. But being valid is a property of transactions, and not on the same logical level (it cannot be mapped on directed graph in the same way as transactions). 
Perhaps a better definition would be (number of validators) * (coefficient of variation ... in something)

The inflation rate and max block size are not comparable. The latter was put in place after the inception of Bitcoin as a temporary measure.
But we agree that no one decides the limit. It should emerge via consensus, and in a sense all this fighting is a part of that consensus forming.

The bit about "clear intentions" of Satoshi and 
Hearn deserve no comment since no evidence is 
presented here.
The "big blocker" argument as pictured here is somewhat 
strawman-like and inaccurate. I think in that camp it is
well acknowledged that increased block size will reduce 
the number of non-miner full nodes; I have never heard anyone 
claim that it would help multiply them. And in fact, this is 
along the lines of what Satoshi said about the futility of everyone 
on Usenet running their own NNTP server.
The more fundamental difference between the opposing factions 
is the question whether Bitcoin derives its value from its users or 
from being scarce, gold-like entity. If you opt for the former, big 
blocks and low fees make sense, and if you think BTC as digital 
gold, then it is in your interest to keep the miners in business by 
keeping fees as high as possible - even if that means imposing 
an artificial limit to the block size.
@_date: 2016-01-20 07:49:07
It was a little more complicated than that. As far as I can make out, Bitcoiners donated btc to Electronic Frontier Foundation. It turned out that EFF didn't know what to do with these: 
They contacted Gavin and asked how they could return the btc. So it was agreed that the lump sum would go to fund the Faucet: 
By the time of the hard fork, the Faucet had been offline for some time and unuseable, because of the scammers. So Gavin gave the EFF donations to compensate the miners of orphans.

If they'd been the same thing, they both would have been hardcoded there right from the start. If they'd been the same thing, Satoshi would not have talked of changing the block size limit. He said : *The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.* Now how can the block size limit be part of the core design, if he added it later, to be changed later? You call me blind, please visit your ophthalmologist.

Well that's always been a problem with the public representation of the Bitcoin scene. It's either world domination or bust, all black and white. Anybody talking to banks would be instantly branded as an apostate to the holy cypherpunk cause.
Yet at the same time, of course there are lots of interaction going on between cryptocurrency specialists and banking sector. A simple google search will reveal a lot of organizations working with permissioned ledgers and "blockchain technology". It is a pretty big thing right now in the fintech world, and makes the entire blocksize debate look like a storm in a teacup.
@_date: 2016-02-16 12:16:07
That's an interesting take. However, it is right here that Bitcoin is likely to meet a real contender in the guise of an altcoin with stronger anonymity features. If not, and if this scenario plays out even partially, it will eventually be subject to strong pressure from regulators. Which will be so much easier when its control has been centralized to a handful of developers and when it has very scarce everyday use.

I understand the concern about loss of decentralization which would undermine the money aspect of Bitcoin. I think by this you mean the number of full nodes. But progress is being made towards mitigating this problem in both camps (segwit, thin blocks). This is veering into another topic, so I just say that big blocks do not necessarily imply intensifying the present trend of diminishing number of full nodes, neither does Core roadmap necessarily help to reverse it.
But I notice a strange turnabout in your argument: now it is the small block vision that is a "new way of transferring wealth that is somehow superior to existing credit services" including a hypothetical government-produced solution. What seems to be the real difference between the two "schools" is that one sees the settlement and payment aspects as united in Bitcoin, while the other wants separate them into layers.
As for the gold in everyday use, physical constraints might render it inconvenient, but if we had a form of gold that was easily divisible to smaller units and easy to transfer over the internet, well, it would be a different situation then, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:07:37
 &gt;Bitcoin was never meant for micro payments. And until it costs more to use bitcoin than a bank, we have a clear winner.
"Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. **The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions...**"
