I think a layperson would think of an actual fork, therefore seeing multiple things coming from its original thing, while still attached haha. I cracked myself up writing that ��. Silly laypersons

Saw that this afternoon and thought g’dang that would have been nice to be on the upswing of that!! I had no idea what it even was, then did some quick research and saw it’s directly related to my career field! Kinda cool tech that I could see gaining even more momentum. But who knows.

What is the most preferred hot and cold wallet? I set up a Jaxx wallet but then scoffed at reading about their fees. My balance still lies within the hands of CB and I’m getting freaked out by all the issues they are having.. I’ve just now moved to gdax but again, same same. I’ve got to get a wallet ASAP.. looking at the Nano Leger S too but it takes nearly 3 weeks to ship?!

Cheers for that. I guess "freaking out" was a poor choice of words. More so alarmed at all the grumblings of people not getting their monies back.. I am new to all this of course, and have a growing account going, nothing big but sure is gaining steam eh. Trying to figure out best options for securing it so as to not have it floating out there I guess.. Probably gonna get roasted for noobness..

I realize you prob had mass gains during the main spike, but dang I’d like to be even half as productive of that. I’ve got 20k left of student loans I’d love to pay off with btc’s ha. As do many others I’m sure.

I just figured this out thanks to your reply and one youtube video ha, and took some off the top of my LTC to XRP. See what happens...
