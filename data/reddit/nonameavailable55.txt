Edited the post, he’s already in by his own choice... i just wanted to help him out with the basics
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:02:03
I am in no way trying to be his tutor I just want him to understand the basics and get correct information. Where is the point in letting him jump into the cold water where he has to struggle through false and correct information (time consuming aswell) when there is already correct, useful and helpful information that I can basically give him? 
I understand your point if it would be about what coin to invest, there he definitely needs to do his own research but understanding the whole system-i definitely disagree with you

your printer might safe the screenshot and if it is connected to the internet it might get stolen somehow

should I try restoring my wallet from the seed while tails is connected to the internet or is that not needed as long as I am 100% sure that I have the exact seed words?
 so do I understand you right if i say that my private keys that are usually a i dont know how long adress are basically translated into 12 words and because this 'translation' is standardized there will be always a program that translates my 12 words into my actual private keys to restore my wallet without the seeds never touching the internet?

Okay good to know but one other thing is that in the output window there are two adresses and 2 amounts one is 0.15 and the other one is 0.03 but i dont know the other adress... Does that mean something is trying to send part of the amount to his adress?
Nevermind its my change adress lol

Yea whats that day
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:52:18
Wise man then! I would agree somehow to that but I can't fully understand why this better than putting all in at once? Of course like you said you will get a decent average of the price but once the price always rises your average would be much higher then when you put in all at once? What am I missing?

Nope its going to bed

Ohh gosh that sucks, i thought ledger is a 100% secure way to store ur coins :/
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:46:46
Isn’t it possible that Ledger somehow has put several seeds on each Ledger before shipping them out and they have them saved and just wait until they decide to steal from all ledgers in the world?
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:28:10
Ohh gosh that sucks, i thought ledger is a 100% secure way to store ur coins :/
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:36:16
