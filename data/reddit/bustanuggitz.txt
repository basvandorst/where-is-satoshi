I told you, I’m good at math.
The faux outrage when you realized you would lose $2000.
His poorly executed multiplication.
Really really well done, made me smile.

Pretty much the only way someone could prove it would be by moving some bitcoin from the origin blocks which only he could control.

There’s a hole in this plan

Your point is important, and it’s something that I considered for some time — probably the biggest reason that I hadn’t jumped in before now.
I went with CoinBase for the relative ease/convenience of purchasing on a regular basis.
I’m in US, so I’m on the hook for capital gains taxes.  I’m not interested in evading tax that I owe, so at the point at which I declare my gains and pay taxes on them I would be “outing” myself anyway, right?
Perhaps I’m wrong, but the non-KYC options seemed significantly more risky in terms of scamming, and the fees for true anonymity are significantly higher.
I’m definitely not a fan of CoinBase, but I had resigned myself to the thought that it was probably the lesser of evils and that I would regularly sweep my purchases into my wallet.
What, specifically, is the better non-KYC option, considering that I’m likely going to be making regular ongoing investments with holding for long term as a goal?

I wonder if the Waaaaahhmbulance accepts BTC?
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:31:35
Thanks for the wise advice!  I understand and 100% agree.
(slowly deletes the BTC Roller Coaster Meme repost that I was preparing...)
I think my head is on pretty straight with this.  I've been watching for a reasonable amount of time, and I've tried to lean towards the side of skepticism.  But there's just too much opportunity here to ignore.

DON’T use Jesus... he will just give your .75 btc away to the poor and you’ll get left with a fish or something.

�� I’m not offended, I know that’s probably the case for lots and lots of people.
But I’m in with a clear head and for the long term ( as is the case with my more traditional investments).  
I’m viewing this spend as just another part of my portfolio (including traditional stocks/funds) — by far the riskiest part — which makes it exciting.
As I see it, buying now (at $9k) isn’t much different from buying in at $3k.  Until adoption is much more widespread, this is untapped potential that is way underpriced.  Once we have adoption, exponential increase in value is inevitable.
The only potential problem is whether those who control the current infrastructure can find some way to stave of the disruption.
Interesting times!
And also, I’m too fat to fit in a Lamborghini so there’s really no point t in cashing out ��

Outstanding, thank you!

Thank you for your thorough answer.  This is as complete and informative a post as I’ve seen on the topic.  Appreciated!

My “portfolio” includes two different passbook savings accounts, a stamp collection, a non interest bearing checking account WITH a Visa debit card, and a 12 month CD,  all of which is hedged with a municipal EE series bond in the amount of twenty-seven fitty .
I stand by my statement. 
(And what the hell are you doin’ snooping around the rest of my portfolio, there Nosey Nancy?!)

Honestly, you're being a bit of a condescending dick.  Making assumptions about my intentions and letting me know how "disappointed" you are in my ignorance doesn't do anything to teach me a "better" way.  
I'm sure it was very satisfying to reference the many other threads, except that 1)they don't tell me which options you use and have had good experience with, and 2)it would have been shorter to just answer the question: 
"I use XYZExchange and ABCWallet -- generally 5% higher fees"
"There have been many threads on here about non-KYC options."
As I see it, there are several very valuable reasons that Bitcoin matters.  
Yes, privacy is one of them, and if it's the most important one to you then that's entirely your prerogative.
I'm certainly not opposed to maximizing ROI, and I don't want to pay more fees than are necessary.  I don't think that makes me a monster.
But if there are alternatives to Coinbase that are secure, straightforward, and also provide privacy (even at a higher but still reasonable fee), I'm perfectly willing to consider paying more for the benefit.

Go for it... what’s the better option and why?  I’m open to learning.

Getting set up now! Hopefully the start of big things.
