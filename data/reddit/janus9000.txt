Am I the only one or don’t you think 2000 new bitcoin a day into the system is too much?
Bitcoin needs 20 million USD fiat money pr day to keep the price steady if the price is 10K 
I’m sorry but first I thought there was only 12.5 new bitcoin created a day.  Not 2000 !
I’m starting to doubt this will ever be something and also still no worldwide adoption as this lightning network is still not up and running 
If the price goes up to 20K then there needs to be 40 million USD a day to buy up all these new 2000 BTC 
2000 new bitcoin a day into the market is too much I think !
Sorry!!   Not a troll

Or everyone hold them..  until the price is right and then fire sale like now!

I am by no means hoping for crash.  
It’s just simple to see this this coming if u follow markets and financial news worldwide.  
Simple as that. 
People won’t let this happen again after next crash and  they will move into decentralised money. 
BTC and other crypto. 
Fiat printed money is not real money.  This is about to change. - Dollar is not tied to anything since 1971.... 
The system as we know is about to change 
Watch this documentary to understand what money is and history of money (medium of exchange)

I know....  :( - but all factors show this is happening again... 
Worldwide dept is exploding and stock crash is about to happen and dollar and fiat currency will follow...
Current system is ridiculous and printed money out of thin air is happening 24/7.......
Sad but true
@_date: 2019-06-19 07:38:41
This is exactly what we should be focusing on. 
As soon as the dollar collapses and next recession kicks in hard, people will turn into decentralised crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-18 01:14:52
Exactly!  -Normal people are simply sleepwalking and have no idea about how crazy this is.

10 million USD pr day to buy up all the new 2000 mined coins every day seem fine by u? - If price sits at 10K Pr coin. 
Yes this is a fire sale when the price drops 20-25% overnight.
And you know this is the case.
miners sit on their coins when the price is low.
Then whales buy and dump them all at same time.
This is why bitcoin drops like this.
What needs to happen here is worldwide adoption and something new in the technology!
Like the Lightning Network so my grandpa and EVERYONE can use this with Zero fees.
Zero fees is what the Bitcoin space needs and transactions under 1 second.
I’m still waiting since 2015. Seems like this LN is still not ready for worldwide adoption.
I know there are some betas LN out there etc...
After this drop yesterday I had enough and sold almost all my BTC
I will come back in at 3000 usd

Please watch this video link and learn about money. 
Federal reserve and history of money. 
Learning this will show you why the rich get richer and why the current system is about to end.

Proof ?  Google it and u will realise in less then a minute
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:50:07
Of course.  Yes USD and all fiat currencies. Tied to nothing 
Global debt has reached an all-time high of $184 trillion in nominal terms, the equivalent of 225 percent of GDP in 2017. On average, the world’s debt now exceeds $86,000 in per capita terms, which is more than 2½ times the average income per-capita.

Not a troll and of course I own BTC.  I sold most of it yesterday. Same as I did 2017 when this happened.
I started to buy again last December.  When the price was 4K 
I’m just telling you what needs to happen.
And yes 10 million USD of new money pr day is a lot
Every month that is 300 million USD of new money into Bitcoin to keep the price stable 
I’m NOT a troll !  
Weird how all of u think everyone is a troll and trying to talk Bitcoin down
Something need to change for worldwide adoption 
I’m just pointing this out !
Lightning Network with transactions taking max 1 second and 0%  or 0,01% fees is something that should happen so people will actually start to use this worldwide 
Otherwise we will just keep everything as it is an high fees and slow confirmation time and price crashes every few months 
Stop being sensitive! - Just pointing out facts here :) 
NOT A TROLL!

And you expect the average Joe to understand this ?
Still have no clue

Limited supply. Do your research :)

I don’t agree. 
The current system will fall.  As before...
People will turn into decentralised money.  
People don’t want the current system after it falls next time.  - The upcoming generation is smart and well informed because of the internet and easy access to information.  
This generation will not be a part of the current system anymore when it falls one more time.
There is a crash every 10 years because the current system is ridiculous.
Real money is limited supply like Bitcoin. 
I think personally that 5-10 decentralised crypto will overtake fiat currency worldwide.   
When this actually happens is the big question.
But in less then 10 years I think
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:47:16
Bitcoin...  &amp; Classic Cars. Real estate good somewhere outside big cities as well.  Buy apartments and rent out.  Not houses...  and regarding to stocks.? - I would never buy any stocks right now. 
That is my honest answer...
Nothing else is attractive at the moment.  
World is flooding with fake money and debt bubble that is about to explode.....
@_date: 2019-06-05 07:47:33
Yes I mean it this easy to do ?
For the average user ?
Like my grandma?  
Is it that easy and is it also secure?
@_date: 2019-06-18 16:47:53
Was the internet simple when it started 1995?
Same with crypto and wallets. 
Seems difficult now.
But in future. - Your Mom won’t touch cash. She will only use crypto to pay for everything from her phone.
Just wait and see.
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:30:51
Hmmmm yeah maybe.... I just thought only 12.5 are created a day.  - Didn’t realise until recently

I don't see any news about something new and exciting around Bitcoin and NO news about the Lightning Network or something 
What are your thoughts and hopes and WHAT IS HAPPENING?
Can people expect something new and some solutions soon regarding the actual use for Bitcoin or the Lightning Network?
Are we looking at 10+ years or ?
I really wanna hear your thoughts and what u see about the future of Crypto here.
