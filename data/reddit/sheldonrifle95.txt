So as a hodler nothing bad will happen to me tomorrow? I'm new to all this you see. I couldn't stand low interest rates any lower and want my capital to grow.

So I could just convert BTC to £ at exactly 11,299 and leave the rest in BTC to deflate for the future? (If I was going to pull out now)

People have been talking about the fork ruining BTC in breadwallet, I'm scared...

You're both logical and a double 0 agent. I trust ya

I think it's because of the small amount. My first purchase was £10 worth from there and they took about £2.60, then on my second purchase of a few hundred they only took like £11, and that was at a higher btc value.
Could be due to different countries tho

So as a hodler I needn't do anything?

What is this HODL of which you speak

This seems like a bad policy if BTC were to take over the world. But then I don't see that happening so yeah, fuck it I'll do that.

I am significantly autistic and likely wouldn't mind

Would this mean, say, you have 1BTC at $1,000. Then price of BTC goes up to $1,500, so you sell 1/3BTC and cash in $500?

Probably losing the investment.
