This appears similar to Kim Dotcom's initiative of creating Mega Net. Kim Dotcom: Mega Net Encryption Will Change World (1:00)- 
Perhaps Bitcloud might like to get to know Mega Net?

Don't interpret this as .gov keeping its hands off crypto.  Now we wait to see what the IRS has to say.

Argentina is once again being Argentina. But there is something different this time. 
From an article in The Economist( published about an hour ago(but dated 4Oct?) as I write this comment(~500PM EDT):
"Argentines have not been able freely to buy dollars through official channels since 2011, when the government plugged them in order to stem capital flight. Since January, when the government devalued the peso by 20%, Argentines earning more than about $1,000 a month have been able to change up to one-fifth of their salary at the official rate. Those who wish to swap more of their inflation-plagued, volatile pesos for stable currencies must do so on a parallel market, referred to as the “blue”.
The blue dollar rate, which is often viewed as an economic pressure gauge, climbed to a record high of 16 pesos to the dollar late last month. In response, the government has told people to simmer down. “Regarding the psychosis that there aren’t dollars and that you have to go to illegal markets to get them, it must be said: society needs to calm itself,” counselled (sic) Emmanuel Álvarez Agis, Argentina’s vice-minister for the economy, in one interview. The blue rate has since come down a little, to 15.60 to the dollar, but it is still far weaker than the official rate of 8.5."
And, the last sentence, in which The Economist gets it wrong: “The album from which “It’s All About the Benjamins” was taken was called “No Way Out”.”(one might wonder if there is any schadenfreude in that sentence)
Argentines making over $1k(USD?)/wk can convert only 20% into USD at 8.5, and get the other 80% at 15.6,cash only. Unsaid, is that Argentines making less than $1k(USD?)/wk will have to buy any USD at 15.6, and cash only.
What is different this time is that Argentines(poor &amp; wealthy alike) have the option to say FU(with thanks to Kevin Spacey) to: (1) their govt &amp; rich class; (2)to a handful of super rich Yankees(the vulture capitalists who refused the haircut) who have bankrupted 42 million people; and, (3)possibly a British Financial Newspaper gloating over the Argentines' misfortune.
The way out, indeed, and that which is different this time, is something The Economist didn't think of and which ZH has ignored for many months now. Argentines(poor &amp; wealthy alike) can sidestep the Peso and the USD by buying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Will the Argentines catch on? Time will tell. Could have some very interesting effects on world finance.

Be careful of getting too attached to crypto in general or any crypto in particular. Over the long haul, I believe crypto is going to be a great and very interesting worldwide education in just what money is and how we choose to use it. Let the dogecoin craze be a warning to keep your perspective and sense of humor. Dogecoin is reminder that money isn't everything, and is actually just a means to an end. Don't become the new Wall St and Fortune 500 Trans-national Corporations, to whom money and profit is everything.

Can 'Deep packet inspection with censorship' stop BitTorrent or The Pirate Bay?

Looks like Cyrus is ripe for someone to do well and help the Bitcoin economy by trading Crypto through localbitcoins.com. Institutions which do not participate in Crypto transactions will be remembered, and will be the first to die as the world changes over to Crypto. Who should be the last holding the terribly over-leveraged(tied to unpayable amounts of debt) and utterly worthless currencies like the Dollar and the Euro, etc? Why- the governments, banks, and the big corporations, of course. They will be the last to know anyway. What's in your virtual wallet? Dinosaurs like the dollar or the euro? I hope not!

If your financial institution will not allow your bitcoin transaction: buy and sell Crypto locally through localbitcoins.com. Crypto is going to replace banks and credit unions anyway. The banks and credit unions which block Crypto transactions will be the first to die.
