You’re a loose cannon. What do you want to talk about: (1) custody risk, (2) sovereign seizure risk, (3) reputational/honesty/fraud risk. You’re bouncing between them all and can’t keep a coherent thought on one.

I hear you but don’t exactly think you’re weighing the risks properly. You’re talking about an organization with &gt; $5B market capitalization. With that said, I haven’t and won’t use Robinhood for crypto because I agree with you that the value comes from being able to control it.

I’m talking about reputation. Your drug addict uncle and a licensed and regulated investment company with &gt;$5B market cap are vastly different things. 
We’re simply talking about whether or not Robinhood is in fact buying the bitcoin to back customer purchases (and don’t see why they wouldn’t). Not buying would be Robinhood intentionally and actively taking a short position against bitcoin. Reckless and senseless. No reason they would do that. They make a handsome spread on those purchases already.

Not an endorsement of this method but maybe consider using Coinbase because at least you have the right to withdraw the BTC if/when you feel comfortable.

What makes you think that Robinhood doesn't hold BTC to back customer purchases? Or are you just saying that there is no evidence that they actually do?

Jesus. Okay man, you’re not following at all but that’s fine. Take care.

Nuance. 
You, sir, can work on thinking in a more nuanced manner. Might help you. You somehow think I’m arguing against you, when I’m strictly pointing out a nuance. Life isn’t black and white but you think I’m those terms. Not every institution is out to screw you, but some are. Not every solution is perfect, but rather weighs various factors. There is no perfect way to hold your bitcoin, but there is a trade off between security and sovereignty on one hand and convenience and ease of use on the other. 
To anyone else reading: yep, you should probably take your bitcoin off exchange and control your keys yourself. Hardware wallets are the best bet.

Yep, this is not the risk we were talking about. Unless you were worried about your drug addict uncle seizing your “bitcorns” for political reasons. Give me a break.

Lol what is this? Hilarious!
