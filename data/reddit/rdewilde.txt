Hunderds as long as no proof is provided.

Please pass me the link to your source...
I searched couldn't find a thing you're saying.

Thats some serious deep research smart guy. Go play outside and let the adults discuss real crypto
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:57:16
How would you know. 
Also, please dont use full caps. Better use an argument.
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:19:12
You be proud bashing someone else's work. What's in it for you? Oh, I'll guess... $5 from competition. That IS cheap.

Would it really make a coin stronger, having a fake floor? Come on, guys on reddit are accusing GAW to not knowing anything about economics, but this even you should have figured out.
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:07:20
Why do you say "without"?
GAW has been clear about at least one financial partner: Cantor

If you'd be right, it'll be an exchange like no other ever existed. It's basically a bank. You've seen anything like it in crypto yet?
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:29:10
It is. Why don't you think it is?
If you're doing research, please use several sources. Not just Hashtalk, and for sure not just Reddit. You might just be screwing yourself, better hold on to it until BETA is over and functions have been added. Then again, make up your mind.

You call that proof? I can see why you're shadow banned..
You didnt got paid 20$ per XPY (what would make you a huge profit) but you were free to sell anyway on public exchange or through paybase. Just take $16... you would have a big profit, that's for sure. What exactly is your loss? I guess you made some good profit. Doesn't sound like a SCAM sitting on your money...
You gave it 2 days to fight up to bitcoin and litecoin, now you are complaining about 'GAW knowing nothing about economics'... who's saying.
And also your last argument 'P&amp;D groups are taking control of XPY' doesn't hold off. Proof? Many coins are in paybase with users holding on to them, others are locked away for staking or with investers who have agreed to hold them.
The only thing that was left in your post was anger. I can tell you one thing, your investments being lead with anger is NOT A GOOD THING.
I hope you make many friends at reddit. I'll see you again at HT within a month I guess.. then you be the man to admit it.
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:38:33
Only 13 XPY and you are making this much of noise! Hahahahah, really? Hahaha. I did even really bother for a second. Hahaha
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:28:16
Sure he doesn't. Did you really think this was for real? He's just angry.. imho for a bashing post it is written even worse than I've seen before.

This was some serious censorship from reddit. Guess there's no freedom of speech over here? Paycoin will be what no crypto ever was before! The $20 floor discussion will make us laugh when paycoin is $100 within 3 months! Paycoin FTW! 
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:05:03
I'll take the bet. 
Paycoin will be 100$ in under 3 months. No need for a floor anyway.
