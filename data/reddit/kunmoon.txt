blockchain.info is really good as your hot wallet

Does he really manage billions? He don't look like a VERY rich person

If a central bank is actively denouncing Bitcoin, then many of them will automatically start taking it more seriously.

I know a lot of people hesitant about bitcoin because of Apple.
Yeah, bitcoin will march on regardless of what they say or do, but it's the difference between marching through mud vs on pavement.

Very interesting concept. Is it correct that deposits will end up as a mining fee in case they are forfeited?

You never know what ridiculous schemes gubmints might try to come up with in the future to look back on blockchain transactions in some lame attempt to squeeze money out of unpaid taxes on purchases (like how NY or NJ goes after people who ordered cigarettes in the mail). The more privacy the better!

for long term funds cold storage, there is some guides like here

Well that is an interesting story.  I think this will be a big deal especially if Bitcoin does good and people don't spend the coins.

Do you think it would make the Muslim community furious and rage and most likely try to attack the Bitcoin network? We all know how easy it is to piss off Islamic extremists. Just a thought.

Do you guys wear bitcoin shirts? Thought this was pretty clever...
@_date: 2014-04-30 04:56:11
Oh it's a really, really nice project. Hope they'll be succeed in making prototype of first bitcoin economy

for medium term funds I'd use paper wallets or 1 time brain wallets with pass-phrases (1 on your desk, 1 local backup, 1 cloud backup)
@_date: 2014-07-06 14:47:36
I was having a general discussion with friends regarding the Bitcoin Jesus fella who just recently launched his Passports for Bitcoin service for the rich folks. Let's say if there was someone who claimed himself to be Bitcoin Muhammad of the Muslim world.

South Americans, in general, are much more acutely aware of the precarious nature of government-issued money than North Americans and Europeans.
@_date: 2014-05-09 08:21:20
It's all because the government does not understand Bitcoin, so response is slow. The government is afraid of doing something wrong, so also more conservative.

i don't fully trust dark wallet 
but it still looks interesting , gonna have a try

Terrorists are bullies who use violence or the fear of violence to coerce action.
Bullies who may lose fiat funding may feel threatened hence Bitcoin is defined as a terrorist threat from a certain perspective.

Interesting stuff.  Love seeing the development of anonymity purpose-driven software.
I try to blend coins just incase anything is being tracked, but to have something built in would be great.
I'll let the early-adopters iron out the wrinkles before I jump in. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 10:00:36
nice picture. I like the colours

The most critical part of bitcoin is arguably the implementation of ECDSA, which would probably be the most scrutinized and heavily reviewed code.  Thus, it would seem unlikely that a serious exploit could be introduced.

I'm not a huge Verotel fan since they went with that stupid "ticket" system back in like 2005 or so. When CCBill adopts Bitcoin, that might be newsworthy.
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:55:58
If there is a charge-back, PayPal will expect you to cover it. If you don't they freeze/close your account same as if it were fiat. Not sure what you think would be different
@_date: 2014-04-30 04:45:34
And what he was banned for?
@_date: 2014-06-29 19:20:28
Well that was stupid.  Using bitcoin to purchase gift cards denominated in US dollars is probably not what most people think when you claim to have made a trip using nothing but bitcoins.

Very glad they've found a good business angel to venturing in this brilliant project

Much more impressive than being a millionaire is consistently being a millionaire or billionaire for more than ten years.
@_date: 2014-06-07 18:16:07
Don't forget the aluminum bubble, or the coal bubble, or the gasoline bubble, or the crude bubble, or the rhodium bubble, or the.... every other commodity on Earth, I think. Not just millionaires, either, of course. It's easy-come easy-go. People don't usually walk away and retire from work/gambling when they're a millionaire, and there are going to be sharp declines in the value of whatever you sell or hold, too.
@_date: 2014-06-14 20:18:53
Wow, a hedge fund invested heavily in bitcoin declares they expect bitcoin to surpass paypal by year end.  I'm sure there is no conflict of interest there
@_date: 2014-06-29 19:29:24
You can't beat them, Join them lol.

They should specify that it's about a carbon footprint. In a crypto-currency forum, people might think that it's a coffee shop that helps you leave a tiny digital footprint. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 10:10:56
one more good tutorial for the beginers. thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:21:50
Government can slow it down or outright banning bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-14 20:19:56
The irony is when terrorists buy in they pay a market premium and again when they sell out, terrorists are going to find more efficient ways to move money, or capitalist are going to milk them to death.

To be honest, I trust more in Bitcoin just because of its large-scale usage and popularity, but I think the time comes very soon for other algos.
