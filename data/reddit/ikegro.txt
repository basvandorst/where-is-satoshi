Can you explain? Are they beginning to tax it?
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:01:01
You sure know your stuff, thanks for the great response!

I'm hodling so I'm not super worried. I just didn't want it to sit below 7k for too long!

So how is Coinbase able to protect from replay attacks?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:46:10
Yeah this is making me sad.

I'm also wondering this. From what I understand, it's pretty unique that Coinbase is even offering to match the new currency and get it up and running pretty quickly.

Look again. It's at 7k on the dot right now :(

I put in $197 2 weeks ago and it's already at $260. Granted, I got a $10 bonus for signing up on coinbase, but still.

Thanks for the explanation. How does the government know how long I have kept it in? E.g. I have coinbase, so I am not sure if they handle it (send me some tax form at the end of the year?) or if I have to self report. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:56:34
I did that yesterday when it dipped to 7k. To the moon!!
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:01:19
That's a very wise sentiment.

Gotcha. I think I was confused in thinking uptime was more important. But it makes sense now, thanks!

Hey man, I'm just here to say I don't think it's cool to call people retards. It's pretty offensive.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:20:25
Are you paying any buy/sell fees with your bot solution? How are you handling that? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:27:03
Is it smart to sell the new coin as soon as coinbase forks it? Then take that money and put it back into some more bitcoin? I don't see how bitcoin could NOT come out on top between the two.

*buys 10 donut shops, accepts bitcoin as payment*

If someone is using coinbase, how do you recommend setting up an automatic transfer to a privately held wallet? And what sort of event should trigger that transfer?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:54:01
That tidbit of info plus your username is a bit concerning..
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:49:42
Just curious, what would you suggest as a place to host a node?
