I mean it's pretty clear the total amount when you make the order and a confirmation page even pops up with the total amount.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:13:17
At least banks let you move money for free

What are the laws in your country for capital gains?
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:23:23
I've considered doing this
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:57:54
And why do you use 10k as some arbitrary value? I could say anyone who bought past 1k deserved the loss
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:18:20
Because it wouldn't be $100 a year more in taxes are you insane? It would be a lot closer to $400 a month in taxes
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:15:09
What is so insane about it?
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:03:41
2015-2016 is 2.8x
2016-2017 is 2.7x
2017-2018 is **18.3x**
do you see a difference in this pattern? That is not normal. 
$2,114 would be 2.8x of 2017
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:57:28
$200.01 over here
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:23:27
they read the instructions that came with the ledger. The instructions said to scratch off the code. There is no reason a video should be required, and if it should be then it should say that in the instructions.

Crypto isn't going anywhere, but that doesn't mean bitcoin can't be replaced with an alt
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:02:10
And that reasoning is what most people have and why it will never recover. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:59:05
that's not how fees work though? they're not proportional.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:05:40
coinbase is not a scam.
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:26:57
he did lock the doors, with a fake lock.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:07:23
BTC delay is 72 hours right now.. now that is ridiculous
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:16:10
Not all
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:26:26
well ledger is backordered to march 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:33:47
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:58:51
Well hindsight is 20/20 so great call dude
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:50:16
Signed what
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:17:06
"good money" doesn't mean main job.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:02:33
when you buy bitcoin on coinbase the price is exactly .5% higher than the current gdax. They then charge 1.5% fee for bank account purchases or 4% fee for credit card purchases. There is no reason they wouldn't just buy them directly from gdax at that time, as they are selling it for more than it's worth, unless they speculate that the price will go down and don't "buy" it until someone withdraws but there is no reason for them to play that game.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:28:28
you don't profit until you sell
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:14:27
And pay a huge transfer fee every time you paid your loan
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:14:54
altcoins give you returns, coffee does not.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:14:24
ethereum had a fork because some people had their coins stolen. A select few decided how to control the coin, that's the very definition of centralization
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:15:37
Coinbase isn't making it a cash advance, your credit card can be, and yes there are many charges that don't qualify for rewards
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:13:29
which exchange?
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:15:29
he already admits he doesn't know technology though
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:17:42
So the only way to get the forked coins is by giving them your private key? If you move the coins to a new wallet after the fork wouldn't the forked coins still be in your old wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:31:44
so before the fork move your bitcoin to a temporary wallet, after the fork move the bitcoin back to your main wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:07:10
Doesn't gdax/coinbase batch sends?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:19:50
What does this have to do with regulation 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:33:38
Are you dilusional
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:42:46
Just go to some of the alt coin subs, it's basically a huge brawl and every coin hates every other coin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:19:19
So you get 72% return a year on your money? I have my doubts
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:14:18
why do i give a fuck what you do
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:06:49
it's a live show and it's a 5 year old kid
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:08:56
i watch CNBC regularly and while they do have a lot of people that hate bitcoin, they have just as many people who defend it. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:08:57
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:47:38
The problem I would have is accidentally sending .01 bitcoin instead of .001 bitcoin. Being drink in a dark place will cause a lot of typos
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:28:14
I mean it says in the article says the bubble pops when the last person buys
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:25:38
Except the hype wasn’t anything near what it is now at $1,000. It was mainstream at 20k, not at 1k
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:23:03
Screenshot or I don’t believe you
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:05:56
what about people that bought at 19.8K? They should feel fine that they just lost 3k?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:58:36
If you want to be inspired read a book
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:25:40
But you don’t spend your whole bank account on bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:59:17
so futures you don't have to pay up front?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:17:58
That doesn’t help anyone that bought at 18k
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:34:10
I really hope you're just a troll and not an idiot
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:17:50
how do you see the price in korea?
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:22:49
I mean coinbase could if you keep it in an exchange
@_date: 2018-09-30 03:36:12
because banks are strict as fuck now. I make a good living with 0 debt, high credit score and it was hard even getting a 300K loan.
@_date: 2018-09-17 10:32:06
but I need an explanation on why it matters that they're selling this data.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:04:45
you can tell from a 20 second clip how good a show is?
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:11:36
and gdax is taking a loss on that. Good luck transferring it anywhere else.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:20:53
He says don't now, but in the future yes
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:25:19
i would just stop giving excuses, you will always find some excuse for why it's going down.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:27:30
Can someone explain to be the difference between options and futures? Because they seem very similar to me
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:17:44
knew this was fake as soon as you said; 


no one says this 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:09:37
you're saying it is fake but you don't even understand what a bitcoin is? Do some research.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:17:02
He says:  "We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it"
Obviously meaning that he would be fine with the change when needed, which would be now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:58:17
I agree and I’m sure a majority of them are fake
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:34:27
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:51:49
almost 14k now
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:56:36
For the masses? No
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:19:59
Not really that easy, most bars fail
@_date: 2018-09-30 05:01:41
i have a long 10+ year history of paying off my credit card in full every month, but I don't have any other loans.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:05:12
the problem is the hype for it is done. All those people that came in to shoot it up to 20k aren't going to come back in.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:07:29
I sell on eBay for a living and I would accept bitcoin if it meant I didn't have to deal with PayPal again
@_date: 2018-09-19 02:54:18
does anyone have a link to the actual story and not just a twitter post of a screenshot?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:07:21
the audience is garbage because?
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:30:49
how is this any different than using coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:21:44
da fuck? that's his money not yours, what does it have to do with you being homeless.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:24:01
i don't know much about bitcoin, what are tether tokens?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:51:02
