Its a multi-sig account set up with Electrum's 2FA option if it makes a difference.  I can provide more detail if neccecary.

im only a little worried because the client prompted me to download an update, and linked me to "patch notes" that dont exist on what appears to be a website pretending to be keep key, which isnt (different security certificates, neither has any links to the other, different stylization ect)

Its give and take, this kinda of safety net is nice and raises the minimum standard if living for the poorest people, but if you happen to never need it, its just higher taxes on you.  Plus the fact that it allows people to make risky ventures like this...  its really a complex question trying to find an ideal balance

My question is how will the prices react, and will i have the chance to benefit with a little luck, risk, and knowledge from the internet?
