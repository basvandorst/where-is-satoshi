I mean exactly what I said, do whatever he could to not have to rely upon the government. The banking system is not what it was back then, so it's hard to say with any certainty what he would do, that's why I used my imagination. Happy trolling friend.

Any use of bitcoin for services or equipment, must be claimed on taxes as either a capital gain or loss.

Awww, thanks!

You generally don't ask for awards. Hitler issued the award to Henry Ford for his work in manufacturing improvements, and of course, the widespread adoption of the assembly line. He never traveled to Germany to accept the award, and nevermind that his plants in Detroit were converted and pumping out war machines to destroy the Reich.

Henry Ford actually heavily resisted taking money from banks. It wasn't until he was under pressure that he caved and took on money, rather than using profits. The Ford of a decade ago saw the writing on the wall and put up their logo as collateral, this is the very reason they didn't have to go to the gov't to get a bailout. I don't know that it's "sad" that they relied upon the banks, and their own good name, rather than Uncle Sam. Given the circumstances, I'd imagine Henry would have done the same.

Henry Ford was not anti-semitic in the sense that he disliked Jews. He saw them as international bankers who worked to control the monetary system through the control of the world's gold reserves and credit. In that context, he was anti-bankers, which in his observations, were driven by Jews. If you want to really understand Henry Ford, read 'My Life and Work'.

Does filing a claim only have to do with the recent bankruptcy, or any instance where their ineptitude cost you BTC?

The code is clean but horribly designed, sorry. It's tightly coupled and hard to reuse or make improvements. I'd suggest taking a more planned approach to the software in order to modularize the codebase, allow for segregated updates, and scale easily.
Rather than using PHP to insert directly into a MySQL database, you could develop a python daemon that reads from a queue that processes the messages, storing them using a data store module that can be swapped out. Using multiple queues with specific routing can help allow the system to scale very well as the user base grows.
Another daemon offers an HTTP REST based API that can be connected to by any number of client libraries of various languages, like the python one you already have. You can have an army of daemons sitting behind a load balancer to handle API load and feed into the various queues.
For the API, be sure not to code into a corner by strongly typing everything as strings or integers, use arrays (or a similar data structure). If a field is not an identifying property then think about the possibility of a record having multiple types of a property.
I don't mean to diminish the hard work you've put into it, but if this is going to succeed, then it needs to be planned out a little better so that the proper kind of collaboration can happen. Props to you for taking the initiative and fostering the discussion!

Also, you clearly identify as a 'neckbeard', so I'm not sure if this is an insult, or an attempt at admiration.

Duck walks into a store, asks the clerk, 'Got any grapes?'
Clerk says 'no.'
Duck walks out. Second day, duck walks in, asks the clerk, 'Got any grapes?'
The clerk barks back, 'I said, no, no grapes!'
Duck walks out. Third day, duck walks in, asks the clerk, 'Got any grapes?'
The clerk fumes, 'No! And if you come back in here asking for grapes one more time I'm going to nail your feet to the wall!'
Duck walks out. Fourth day, duck walks in, asks the clerk, 'Got any nails?'
'Got any grapes?'

Were you not around for BitcoinMarket or the early MtGox days? Solid software design is required for this to work effectively and remain secure. No one asked for perfect, I offered suggestions based upon what I saw and my own experience in software design.

This has happened to me on multiple occasions with various packages. I wonder if it's a common practice, or [puts on foil hat] something that's unofficially sanctioned to get you into the post office for some reason.

Given that transactions can have fees, and the 'interest' could be in the hams own transaction, on its face, it would violate the rules. However, if you only sent transactions without a fee and did not send your own transactions, that should absolve any pecuniary interest.

I dunno, but MtGox Live is down and my orders are taking forever...

It's not that I'm mad at you, but why couldn't you be more helpful the first time round?

I agree completely about finding out why this is happening, that's why I posted it here. It's getting to the point that we are trusting these exchanges with our money but without them really taking on any of the risk for us. If the weak point is the exchange network then this currency will fall flat on its face fast.
Thanks for the info on the password storage.
@_date: 2011-06-16 14:37:53
Yep, I have a support request in with them to get the IP where the requests on their site came from. Didn't I just read a story about how you can actually track BTC transactions...?
@_date: 2011-06-19 00:33:01
I love this idea. I think at the very least we should come up with a list of features for the software and work them out. It will make writing the code much easier to split up and write. As well as allowing for pretty quick code reviews.
@_date: 2011-06-16 14:36:49
It was based a non-dictionary word, they would have had to brute force it. I use *nix on everything so it's unlikely it was software or a site I visited.

WTF kind of stupid response is that? Wait it out? MtGox has gone to shit.

No, no, and no. I'm just wondering how traceable this is.
@_date: 2011-06-16 14:54:57
Nope. Was thinking about getting into it, but now that doesn't seem like such a good idea.
@_date: 2011-06-16 14:52:20
Yes, it was secure.

I'm also on board but I'm of the Ruby on Rails camp myself. It's been about 2 years since I did dev, but I can do JS to RoR/PHP on the backend. I'd love to write the API!
@_date: 2011-06-16 14:04:04
Thanks, I guess we'll see just how traceable this is. Any way to get IP information for this address or its transactions?

I hope they're in financial shape to help me recover my money!

I've still not heard anything. I posted in the MtGox reddit, got a response from someone to send them my support request (did this yesterday) and the support request is still not accepted and I've not had any other contact from anyone at MtGox.
I know I should not have been counting on that money, but I was. If BTC is to be a currency that people can trust, these types of things can't happen. And when they do, they should be treated properly by those who manage the funds.
