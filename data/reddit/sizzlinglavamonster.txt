Got a lot to learn here. Is it possible to buy bitcoins and have them already delivered to your external wallet.? Or do you always have to start by going to Coinbase or another site similar?

Thank you. I’m just going to let it sit there for some time. Until I read more about getting my own hardware wallet . No clue how it works, definently not computer savvy

Lmao I haven’t heard anything good about the green option
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:00:36
Why am I to stupid to understand this? Can you explain this joke lol 
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:17:33
How do you purchase it?
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:33:26
How exactly would you just lose it? It seems like if you see it going down in stocks,You can just sell it? Or even just hold on to it until it goes back up. Sorry for dumb questions, just started looking in to it tonight

If you only had 200 dollars to spare, would you buy the whole 200 dollars in bitcoin tomorrow? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:17:59
Thank you sir, or ma'am 
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:49:10
What's the difference ? Are the bitcoins still saved in the same "wallet" ?
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:00:38
Sadly no.... I'm a recovering degenerate with about 20 thousand debt at 26 years old. I work my ass off for 18 an hour but still can't get ahead. Really I'm just in desperate need of something good to happen before, any advice is appreciated.
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:34:08
Also how ,I have would someone expect to get out of 200 dollars? And in how much time period.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:56:39

Thank you, for breaking it down!!! And not being a fuckin dick about it like these assholes lol. Guess I clearly need some math classes though lol.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:09:36
I laughed pretty hard at this one to hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:59:22
Yah, I’m clearly going to have to go back to take some math classes. Thanks for helping me make the decision lol. Seriously. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:50:46
That makes since so you’d only have around half of it after the fact ?
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:51:16
The same reasons why I would need it in bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:52:03
