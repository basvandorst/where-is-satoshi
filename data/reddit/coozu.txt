BOA owes me 600 bux cause their fraud department is stoopid.  Bitcoin doesnt owe me $600.

1 week before - lots of panic sales, price drop
Aug 1 - huge price drop
1 week after - one side dies, the other price explodes to ATH

I was thinking something similar here.  Moving to ETH &amp; hope for some growth in value there.  Get the dip around that Aug 1 date.
5k to ETH today, may grow to 6k by mid-July
  &amp;nbsp;  
End of July dip drops Bitcoin back to 3k
  &amp;nbsp;  
All ETH back to Bitcoin, resulting in 2 Bitcoin for the initial 5k
  &amp;nbsp;  
Lots of assumptions in there, might go horribly, but if all goes well.....

market cap would have to be like 500 trillion at that point.  &amp;nbsp;  
not feasible
