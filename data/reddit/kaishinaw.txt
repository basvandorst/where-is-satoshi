That is true but I think all the above are all closely tied to the protocol mechanism chosen by the chain so it will have to be a big part of the initial design

Thanks for the read. I think one important distinction to be made between potential tokens when compared to the dot com boom is that public blockchains can be forked. Meaning that capital controls on data becomes much more difficult. Essentially, even if you find the 'one' token, someone could easily fork the token and split the network value (look at BTC vs BCC, ETH vs ETC)
I am much more bullish on BTC as its use case has been achieved with not much need for future development relative to other cryptos. Its much harder for a coin to establish a strong network than it is to solve a specific problem. Moreover, I do think that BTC is superior to gold as a store of value so it is probably a matter of when that people start realizing this.
tldr: BTC will probably outlast other cryptos due to network effects and little need for change. Keep the forks of BTC as a hedge as the Bitcoin chain will likely continue being the digital gold

Yeah, I think the market as a whole tends to conflate these two functions which leads to bad investment models

Thanks! Hope you got something out of it. :)

The good thing about blockchain technology here is that forking will enable the network to move towards the balancing point which suits them the most

Thanks for pointing it out. Didn't even know this was a thing, used it more for a better flow.
Found this which might explain the difference: [
