Wait until btc futures opens. There's still the possibility of an orchestrated short by whales.
Alternatively, maybe hop on now and watch what happens when futures hits? You could sell early on and reinvest if it looks like things are going south.

personally I can’t wait for bitcoin to “go on sale”, so I can pick some up and hodl ;)

Satoshi is great but will the name catch on outside the btc community? I think “bits” is more intuitive and recognizable. 1 bitcoin = 100,000,000 bits.

this is how I feel about not buying btc at 600 three years ago lol

I’m curious about what will happen when the btc futures market opens

I've been waiting for a good time to buy in since 10k but I'm really worried about buying in before the futures market opens because of the possibility of a short

In 2014 I bought $10 of dogecoin...it appreciated to $25, but if I had bought bitcoin I'd have $260...
I wish I had the money to invest at the time. Heck, I still only have less than $100 in all of crypto, but it's fun to play with cryptocurrencies and maybe it'll be worth more in a year's time :)

I’m looking at coinbase right now and I can get $10 of btc (0.0006) via bank transfer with a $1 fee. It’s not a good option for traders because of the week-long delay times, but seems like it would be fine for hodlers, esp. with dollar cost averaging? Am I missing something?

Oh man remember dogecoin? Good times. Tipping with dogecoin was actually pretty fun

I think the earliest I remember seeing btc was $600. I didn’t really have the money to buy in then, but wow, knowing where it is now is so fucking depressing. It’s basically missing out on free money.

That's exactly what has me wary. Bitcoin purports to be a currency, but people treat it as an investment. Few (legal) vendors take it, and even if more did, few customers would pay in btc since they're hoping to make money off of it (the $100 million dollar pizza problem, if you will). What is Bitcoin's real value at this point in time, apart from others thinking it's valuable?
