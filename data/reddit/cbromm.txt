He didn't comb his hair with bitcoin

I feel like it's not all bad. With Libra you are going to have a main stream market of billions of people being exposed to a type of digital asset. When they see Bitcoin double or triple it's value while stable Libra coin just sits neutral they will jump into the BTC crypto space. Who knows maybe there will be Libra/BTC trading pairs...I feel this is healthy for crypto.
