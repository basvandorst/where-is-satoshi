Adam Tepper here from [Independent Reserve](  
If you're looking to buy Bitcoin with AUD, according to  Independent Reserve generally offers good value even after taking into the AUD/USD conversion.  There are a few reasons for this.  By trading against USD, we are working with several market makers out of the US that are able to provide liquidity and offer a tight spread - and I expect the spread to become even tighter in the coming weeks as new arbitragers are coming on board.
The other reason is that our AUD/USD rates are extremely competitive.  For reference, our current conversion rate is 0.8547, compared with 0.8312 with ANZ Bank (at the time of writing).  We are similarly competitive against the other major banks in Australia.
Our trade commission is only 0.5 % as well.
Hope you'll give us a try - please send a message via our Support screen if you have any issue creating an account or verifying your identity, and I'll be happy to help.

Adam Tepper from [Independent Reserve]( here.  As of 21 October, there is now one more Bitcoin exchange in Australia.  
Our fees are 0.5 %.  According to [Compare Bitcoins]( I believe that we offer the best value relative to other exchanges in Australia.
Would be interested to get your feedback.

Adam Tepper from [Independent Reserve](  Regrettably, we don't yet have a facility in place to direct debit your account, however we do offer the ability to pay inusing BPAY.  Funds are usually credited to your account the same day.
If there's anything we can do to make it easier for you (aside from direct debit), please contact us via email and let us know.
As swordfish6975 commented below, we are not required to charge GST on Bitcoins purchased through Independent Reserve, and our trade fee is 0.5 %.
Hope that helps.

Adam Tepper here from Independent Reserve.  That is correct.
Independent Reserve provides an open marketplace for buyers and sellers, and does not buy or sell Bitcoin in its own right. Therefore we are not required to collect GST on the value of Bitcoin traded.
Independent Reserve does include GST as part of the brokerage fee charged to Australian customers, however this GST is absorbed within the standard 0.5 % trading fee and ultimately paid out of our own profits.

Adam Tepper here from [Independent Reserve](  We launched our exchange on October 21.  
According to [Compare Bitcoins]( Independent Reserve generally offers the best value compared with other Australian businesses.  
Our commission is 0.5 %, and we are not required to charge GST on trades, as we run an open marketplace.
Our finances are also audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
I'd be interested to get your feedback.

Credit card is difficult with the banks.  We do accept BPAY (for Australian clients), which is generally processed the same business day (or next business day at worst).

Adam Tepper from [Independent Reserve](  There's a reason Bitcoin exchanges ask for this information, and each exchange takes their own approach to this.  Ironically, the reason is due to poor banking infrastructure, one of the reasons people choose to use Bitcoin.  If a Bitcoin exchange receives a fraudulent transaction through a bank, this is expensive for the bank to investigate.  Banks don't want clients that have a high-risk of fraud they need to investigate.  Bitcoin exchanges want to maintain their banking relationship.  It's unfortunate, but this is the reason each exchange tries to lower their risk profile - some better than others.
[Independent Reserve]( will also require you to submit some documents. I apologise for the inconvenience of this, but if you'd like to create account, send a message to Support with details of this post and I will do my best to have your account approved as quickly and painlessly as we can.
