Here's a follow up question; what stops an individual claiming a charge back from an ATM (those shoddy ones that charge a flat fee to withdraw)? Or even cash back at a store? I guess it's the payment gateway provider, and the fact you can enter chip and pin?

Looks awesome guys, I would love to buy one; any plans for NFC or non-wired features? Also, any peaks on the metallic case?
Edit: Saw it on your Facebook cover photo, noice!

This is cool and all, but is it just me or is this just a sneaky way to fund a honeymoon?

This is pretty awesome! 
Here's an idea, a note acceptor that pre-loads the printed wallet with Bitcoin to the value of the cash; a true 'cash/paper Bitcoin' ATM.

So essentially a modified/dedicated bitcoin wallet, with a truncated private key? Then send the other half in a separate letter or email?

So you're saying... milk the cash cow before ebay slaughters it? hnngh. 
But in all seriousness, Paypal can really benefit from Bitcoin regardless if it's competition UNLESS they want to offer Bitcoin as a tradable currency themselves. I don't get the Bitcoin vs. Paypal argument; it's as if to say American Football is in competition with Traditional Football/Soccer.

That's what I/other has been doing, but there's still nothing stopping them from making a dispute or even worse a charge back. I fell victim to it a while ago, and Paypal said "no seller protection for virtual items, sorry lul".

But they'd buy it on the basis they checked the wallet/address amount, and the 'piece of paper' had the same address as advertised.

Maybe sort some form of luxury apartment rentals? Short and long-term

20 year lease? So in 20 years time you're evicted and are $650,000 (in bitcoin) out of pocket?
EDIT: Quickly googled and found leasehold. So it's budgeting for rich people/bitcoiners

"Realistically, if you sell bitcoin to someone, you have no idea what it will be spent on" why would one be paranoid about that? Sure, be conscious, but how could anyone maintain responsibility of what the exchanged goods are used for in the long run? If that's the case, banks are responsible for illicit goods exchanged for cash

My local listings are full of Fiona Cooper 80's preggo porn DVDs.

Maybe not 'regulate' it, but crippling it by making it illegal for whatever reason. It becomes as taboo as illegal fire sharing; permanently dropping in value due to the difficulty of investing/withdrawing it due to banking/payment gateway regulations.

Hm, perhaps recorded/signed for delivery on expensive sales (e.g. &gt;1 bitcoin)? Though that'd become awkward for international delivery.
