I give up.

Well apparently it was his payout after handing Silk Road to DRP.  Who he explicitly states he is not.

I don't like witch hunts that's all.  Everyone deserves the our American right that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty.
You're ready to jail a man for the rest of his life, even though it hasn't been proven without a reasonable doubt yet.
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:50:56
Your blindly taking that as a fact. You knows it's all **alleged**, right?  As in no one really proven it yet? 
Obviously the fed would like everyone to think that the 170,000 was his cut from every sale; but yet that has yet to be proven without a reasonable doubt.

You in particular should go to  and read it all.  Stop being so ignorant. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:12:49
I already did -.-
@_date: 2015-01-16 16:34:42
What do you mean? You're still here.
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:05:02
Well you could read any of the news stories about today's case.  He states that he handed over SR to DRP and in the final months they persuaded him to have him back. 
But hey you already have your mind made up so I'm wasting my time with you.
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:34:48
Commission for taking the site back over perhaps?  You keep speculating. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:23:56
DPR didn't show up until a few months after the site was operational which  is Ross's defense. He's states he created it but left it to DPR after a few months.   But you keep coming to your own conclusions without reading what was discussed in court today.

Your going on trial for beating your wife.   There is no solid evidence against you but your trial will be referred to as the Wife Beaters trial.  
Sound like your getting a fair trial?
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:44:37
That's some nice google work you got going on!  Hopefully the jury isn't as dead set as you are. You keep speculating.
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:31:21
Lemmy type that again for you:
It is alleged by prosecutors in recent court filings that **gross revenue** reached over $1 Billion
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:19:20
Please stop saying the Silk Road Trial.  That is exactly what they want the public to think.
This is Ross Ulbricht trial.  Saying the silk road trial make people think that he's guilty before being proved guilty. 
He's alleged Silk Road creator.  Not proved yet, please don't continue this verbiage. 
Edit:  All these comments disappoint me. You're all fail IMO
Double Edit: OP's Salty &amp;  lol
Edit after new that Mark is likely to be DRP:   I couldn't be happier with this outcome.  See why you don't make up your mind about someone without knowing all the fact?
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:11:40
This should really be at the top; not my post.
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:01:49
Exactly.   The entire case surrounds **if** DPR is Ross.
Not proven yet.  People saying Silk Road trial is marking him at the creator of silk road prior to it being proven.  You've basically said my statement is untrue but then stated what I'm saying it true.... 
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:17:43
It's not a theory; it's a just not nice to paint someone with an unproven brush.  
The case against him is that he was in control the entire time; he states it was only the first few months and that he never went by DPR.  Most of the accusations are against DPR not Ross. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:51:48
He will get hosed, I never said otherwise.  This is unfortunate; the mentality of this thread proves that no matter what the jury will mostly side with the fed. 
Is it due to the media painting him with the DRP brush for the past few months? Maybe... 
Sorry for thinking people should be allowed a fair trial before everyone makes up their mind about an individual. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:20:39
With bitcoin he had no need to know who the real DRP is but still be able to be highly compensated from him.  
Maybe it was "Hey wanna take over this project you started? I'm sick of it; I'll give you close to 170,000 bitcoins if you do." 
Also it seems you think that the silk road only made 170,000 bitcoins in profits? It is alleged by prosecutors in recent court filings that gross revenue reached over $1 Billion, making 170,000 bitcoins is a drop in the bucket so to speak. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:14:23
No I mean you shouldn't insinuate that someone is someone when it hasn't been proven to be.   And from today's case; he's not DRP but yet the creator of silk road.   Ironic eh?
