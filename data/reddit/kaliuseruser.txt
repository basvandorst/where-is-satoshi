The real potential of bitcoin is not seen yet because people are still evaluating their bitcoin fortune by converting it to USD. I want to be able to buy a domain name ($11) with 0.01 BTC whether 1BTC=$100 or 1BTC=$10000 .

you still can't use it to transfer large amount of money with low fees. Bitcoin offer better security than anything apple could come up with, let them clean the icloud mess before people can trust them with their money.

That has nothing to do with Islam, this is only practiced by Shia, which don't represent Islam.
So stick with what you know and don't spread false information.

Those are two different things, pending in coinbase means that it's still being processed by coinbase before they send it to you. After they send your Bitcoin to your address, the transaction will appear in the blockchain waiting for confirmations.

I think he meant linux in the sense of having a secure OS as an alternative to Windows. You don't have to install linux to run Electrum, It's already available to Windows users.

It's a lightweight wallet for Bitcoin, which means you don't have to download the whole block chain to start sending/receiving bitcoin.
