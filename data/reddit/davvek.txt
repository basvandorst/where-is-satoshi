Say that I withdraw that small amount of bits, would I lose what I had due to the transaction fee from the changetip t a seperate wallet?
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:37:40
That is what I was thinking. I'll only have the amount I can afford to get stole at me at one time.

Maybe we as should tip more just like @_date: 2014-06-17 12:50:42
Hey, just a question. Is it an external address or is it a local address (i.e the one on the profile page of the buckysroom user).?

I'm so sorry for what that journalist did to your family.
Have some model trains!

I'm just curious, wouldn't the transaction cost for transfering that small amount outweigh that amount?
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:44:00
Done! I'm looking forward to spending money there :)
Here's my profile link 
And here is my address

You do realize that was a joke... Right?..

Isn't it supposed to be the other way around? The guests give the gifts?

Can I ask what the most popular website in the world is then?

Stupid questions ahead, be warned!
* What about deflation?
* Since transactions need to be processed, wouldn't be stupid to wait X minutes for the transaction to be confirmed X times when I could instantly pay with my card?
* Can anyone explain/give a analogy of what happens when a pool gets 51%
* I read somewhere on r/bitcoin that transaction costs would be lowered ten-fold, wouldn't that mean not enough profit/incentive for miners to keep verifying which would mean less miners which would mean.... You know.

Good point, I live in a place where robbery/crime rates aren't very high. So I'm going to have to be really unlucky to get robbed of my phone.
Any ideas to keeping myself secure? Hire guys with sniper rifles to stand on the roof protecting me?

Please elaborate on this hardfork, what happened?
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:03:31
So if the Bitcoin foundation released a patch that made all the transactions (Or at least ever below X) free and and/or a bunch of other changes then how would that affect other Bitcoin users/miners/pools?
EDIT: I meant how that would affect people who/who did not use the latest.

Exelent coverage mate! It gave some much needed coverage from the point a Bitcoin user, not a banker who doesn't "understand" Bitcoin.
