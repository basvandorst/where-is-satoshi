IMO, it's a steppingstone for the introduction of BTC in the U.S. economy!
@_date: 2014-08-23 07:20:47
Is it a street or what? 
@_date: 2014-07-17 08:46:11
10 BTC is a lot. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 07:20:51
Soon we will be able not also feel the history, but change the history!

Who is he? And why this John Edgar is so important? 
@_date: 2014-08-24 07:22:55


Yes they do and that's a reason why we will stay tuned
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:43:38
Happy Birthday dude. Seems that this year was full of fun for you! 
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:42:35
Peoples always do this :3

Integrating with a torrent cliend is a huge waste of traffic. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 05:33:21
It is one of the best articles I've read lately. It is inspiring!
I agree with all his conclusions
@_date: 2014-08-24 06:26:54
Can be sure i'm your seed since now ;)
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:46:13
Not so big believe me. There are a way more Bitcoin ATM in US. 
@_date: 2014-09-02 20:21:02
when you take into account the Zimbabwe dollar saga, and now africans are stepping into non government currencies like bitcoin/mpesa.. you have to ask yourself what will the rest of the world do when you cant even buy a loaf of bread for less than 2000 USD/GBP

I never liked Budweiser, but it seems it will have to start drinking it

USDPS! United states Dark Postal Service.

Russia is a country where the cashless payment system is underdeveloped.  Bitcoin system requires well-developed technical infrastructure that can't be ensured. That's why country  does not keep its assets in the crypto currency IMO. It's to risky!
@_date: 2014-07-20 17:00:38
Now we know not only who pays but also that Bitcoins will be alive and kicking! 
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:56:51
IT'S A BITCOIN-BUILDED C-C-COMBO! 
@_date: 2014-05-03 06:14:18
I'll be glad if the Bitcoin will improve the situation of developing countries. Some borrowers unable to repay the loan . How it will affect the system?
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:42:21
Ha ha, you have a great sense of humor
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:44:56
I'm also tired of 'empty promises'.  I think they should start to act and not to plan
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:44:49
Not so much... i thought that there are ten or twenty... Hmm.
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:45:15
Join the club
@_date: 2014-07-17 08:47:22
He said in Bitcoin subreddit =_=
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:59:33


Imo exchange rate is the main thing that Banks are worried about
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:49:14
Not a nonsense. This subreddit is full of messages about Bitcoin ATM which are placed in different parts of Great Britain. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:49:28
To the Moon! 
@_date: 2014-07-20 17:00:00
Just because he doesn't use Bitcoins? 
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:50:03
Imo everything is ok. It's a Bitcoin subreddit so nothing new. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:58:24
It has another meaning, which is connected with Bitcoins, but not with a gift cards
@_date: 2014-04-30 16:02:06
It's wonderful news! 
Especially I liked the idea of bringing smart people working in the NSA.
Roger Ver is really our patron who will lead the system to the prosperity IMO
@_date: 2014-08-23 07:20:47
Looking for someone? 
@_date: 2014-07-20 17:00:00
Just because he doesn't use Bitcoins?

@_date: 2014-07-17 08:57:40
Yes. I'm very happy because i understand what's wrong and what should be changed to change situation with bitcoins
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:42:53
Your link is broken
@_date: 2014-08-24 07:08:38
The headline is quite strange for such things
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:43:56
He lives an amazing life!

Altcoins traditionally fail when some several subsidity reductions occured (coins with shorter lifecycle out there)
A coin cannot exists on transaction fees. Those are merely a security against blockchain spam attacks.
So when mining becomes impossible due to subsidy reduction, and transaction fees cannot compete with altcoins out there, Bitcoin will simply extinct.
@_date: 2014-07-17 08:46:44
I'm pretty sure that you don't know what you are talking about
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:57:05
WIth your bitcoins of course! 
@_date: 2014-05-22 05:33:34
I wonder how the government relates to the such streets and even towns? The state  lose part of their income in fact
@_date: 2014-07-17 08:46:24
They made a history 
@_date: 2014-04-30 15:37:31
I like the approach to teaching in the MIT. They give freedom for innovation and not afraid to try implementing innovative ideas of their students. Yes, their students haven't invented Bitcoin, but these students convinced the faculty that the system deserves their attention. And it is important!
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:42:43
Wow, good job man. Hope that your trip to Amsterdam will be ok
@_date: 2014-09-22 05:36:54
Yeah there will be a rally last quarter for BTC - hodl
@_date: 2014-07-17 08:56:28
You should use coinbase to find out
@_date: 2014-08-23 07:20:48
You can boom something even without a dynamite! 
@_date: 2014-05-03 06:14:38
Can you share with me the information? When CeBIT starts this year? How can I take part in the CeBIT? How much is it costs?
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:47:04
Yeah. Love black color and how it looks with Bitcoin ATM =D
@_date: 2014-05-03 06:13:03
I like that spread of Bitcoin began at MIT . In my opinion, Ivy League universities should participate in the system for a short time. And the system will be in each university of the U.S. for a few years later.
@_date: 2014-08-23 07:20:52
No i'm seriously thinking about to travel to Florida. Where can i buy tickets by using my BTC wallet? 
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:46:47
Is VapeLap a nice place to visit? 
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:57:52
Another ATM? Awesome. I will use them  in my trip to Europe. I promise
@_date: 2014-07-17 08:47:00
Hope that they'll bring in to Europe
@_date: 2014-08-04 01:45:31


It's nice. Nice.
