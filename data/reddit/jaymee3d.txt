You may want to work on your titles a bit. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:49:00
Good, i think everybody is getting tired of the 200 reposts a day here.
And obviously you don't have to check every post. There is a search function available.  
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:06:42
Do you realize that he is just a random guy on Twitter claiming something. 
It scares me how many people suddenly believe this guy. 
He making a claim on Twitter is no different than you or me making a claim.

Congrats. Instead of one of the 50 existing threads you could've posted this in you created your own thread. Well done!
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:18:32
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:46:07
Omg yes we know!
It's been posted all day already. How can you possibly think you are breaking that news here?
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:55:49
Stop. Please stop. 
It isn't even true. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:53:17
No. He never claimed he knew anything about the Bitcoin hack. So it's not the same guy. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:50:53
You haven't seen any post because you didn't look for it. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 10:20:39
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:53:36
Stop lying. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:31:48
Could it be that's because the news is so old already?
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:12:41
So now you're gonna connect news from 1 day earlier to his tweet? Wtf? Are you people just looking for a new messiah or what?
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:09:15
No he didn't. Where do you get that nonsense from. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:30:22
Yes and i'm sure they have that. 
I'm just pointing out this part as some people seem to suggest Ross has nothing to do with anything. If that was the case he wouldn't have the SR admin open. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:13:43
He didn't! Stop saying this!
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:07:29
Being sued for a crazy amount has nothing to do with having money. 
He also didn't predict anything specific. 
People make predictions every day. He could've been talking about something else and got lucky. 
Stop trusting random people on the internet and apply some critical thinking. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:31:07
We got it the first 30 times it was posted. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:21:33
Please stop. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:59:49
So you found this link in the already existing thread about this on top of the mainpage and started a new thread because you want attention?
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:07:16
We know. It was posted 30 times a day ago. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:18:32
Not really no haha. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:29:01
So 90% of all the price action we saw the last 2 days is from 1 guy? And he used it for trading?
Use some common sense man. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:49:34
They caught him with his laptop logged in to the SR admin. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:55:32
Half a day ago this place was filled with "this is gentlemen" posts and other nonsense and anybody who even dared hinting at that we might go down again was downvoted to hell and ridiculed. This sub never learns. Never.
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:28:16
When 1000's of these mails go out do you really think you're the first to post it here?
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:14:50
Something big will happen february 10. 
There, i did EXACTLY the same thing as this guy. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:59:48
We got it the first 30 times it was posted in the last 4 hours. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:10:07
Ok well then he has to be guilty. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:38:24
Yes we know. We got it the first 30 times it was posted.
