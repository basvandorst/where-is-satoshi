Quite longer than 8 months ago was about the time I started attempting to withdrawal over 10k in USD from them. I did all the necessary reading, I saw the red flags, they just simply wouldn't give me my money.

Yeah, I understand it was risky. When things started getting "sketchy" is when I pulled out of Gox....but it has been in queue forever.

I actually had contacted some local cash dealers here in Chicago, but I felt like that was a risk all in itself. Not to mention my paranoia of buying at $900 and then them being worth $400 by the time I got to the "meet up".

What exactly is this subreddit for?
Half of these comments are laughing at and shaming people for buying Bitcoins in the world's largest and most popular website. 
In my case, I've had over 10k USD in "pending withdrawal" from Gox for over a YEAR. I've emailed them about it, I've tried setting up alternatives. I got fucked. It has nothing to do with the volatility of bitcoins, or investing. This money wasn't on the open market. 
I'm not asking for pity, but it's amazing that this subreddit, of all places, will shame you for being in this terrible situation.

That's bullshit. When I **gave** Gox money, they were by far the most reputable exchange in the world. The minute things started looking sketchy, I got paranoid and setup over 10k in withdrawals. The waiting game fiasco went on for almost a year, and now it's gone. 
So it's not like we're blind, greedy, idiots. If you're saying that I'm at fault, then you might as well say that bitcoin should be outlawed and classified as fraud.

Not going to happen unfortunately. Sorry to hear.
Once you've accepted your loss, you should upload your wallet as an official stress tester though. That'd be interesting to see how many people took a shot at it.

2 withdrawals for 2K USD on September 30th and October 1st. Neither has posted to my Chase account (USA).
I actually just sent them an email asking for it to be reversed so I can buy some BC and trade locally. Unless you guys know of a better option to simply turn this Gox money into actual money again?
