I'm following local communities and chat rooms in here to improve my language and to learn about the market. As far as I can see, IOTA is the top altcoin right now. Ripple is also well-known. Dash, Zcash and NEO has also got some popularity. I never saw people talking about Monero.
Last week YYW was very popular with the pump but no one cares about it nowadays.

Popularity of cryptocurrencies are skyrocketing in Turkey right now. As a stranger living in Ankara, my local groceryman asked me if I'm holding any Bitcoin. I told him "No, I'm HODLING YOU MF!"
Anyways, devaluation of Turkish Lira led people to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, especially on nonlocal exchanges that are using USD because there are both win-win situation against Turkish Lira.
Especially in the last two months (USDTRY was 3.40 on September, now it's 3.85) I guess there is a huge flow to these exchanges and government would like to action against it. Last week in parliement, they were discussing to tax local exchanges but it think it will take a long time to take action because there are no laws about these exchanges or cryptocurrencies at all.
Mehmet Simsek tries to scare people by tweeting bullshit on Twitter but I don't think that will work.

Central Bank and government officials is in conflict right now. Cryptos is one of them (also interest rates, independency of the central bank, etc...) 
Capital Markets Board is also supporting cryptos (especially the blockchain technology)
So the government in here is opposing everything, even themselves!
