Ha, unfortunately I work for HMRC. (Going to make me really popular here..)
It seems that people that have trouble with this sort of thing never use their right to appeal. If you appeal, the tribunals default position is to side with the taxpayer against HMRC to the point where HMRC requires a pretty much watertight case to win it.
These forced collections are well past the point where you can appeal. Anybody that doesn't actually owe tax should not reach this point.

While true in theory, the practical outcome is not the same.
You have to ask. "What kind of users are going to sell things here instead of ebay?"
While a small percentage of users might sell on darkmarket for purely ideological reasons, it is completely naive to ignore that most sellers would be those that are simply illegal.
While you could then debate the positives/negatives of law and the benefits of a free market, the simple fact is that the major attraction that darkmarket will have is the sale of illegal goods.

Except they can only use the powers specifically when they are owed money and the person repeatedly refuses to pay. 
They also certainly don't get preferential creditor treatment when it comes to bankruptcy. 
While what they are doing is very morally sketchy, can you please not post completely incorrect information

Yeah. After reading through this thread I've come to realisation that the comments will never be worth reading in I mean, I can understand the libertarian views, but most people here seem to relish being in the minority just so they can bitch about things and act superior.
@_date: 2014-01-08 08:23:55
The fact that this has almost as many downvotes as upvotes is the point where I realise just how retarded commenters in this sub are.

Admittedly my view was completely related to western developed countries and I can see there being more value the more oppressive a regime is.
However, even then my point was correct. You are going to be primarily attracting those that are undertaking illegal actions (Regardless of how stupid the laws may be).
I personally have no real problems with that at all, I'm not a huge fan of a lot of laws. I just dislike the fact that everybody here knows the primary use will be illegal activities. You then compare it to the internet just because the internet "CAN" be used for illegal activities.

Idk, their thread titles tend to be more entertaining than most the comments here.
@_date: 2014-05-12 12:38:15


Except in this scenario, the taxpayer gets "charged" (An enquiry concludes that they owe tax) and the court system decides that they are guilty BEFORE this even comes close to being an option.
You act as if all safeguards and regulations are removed in the name of convenience. As if the government is going to go into bank accounts and forcibly take incorrect amounts. That is simply hyperbole.
Once again, I do think the whole idea is morally sketchy and I won't say that I support it. But if a person owes tax, a tribunal backs up thew decision and they refuse to pay...then it is udnerstandable to collect the money as cheaply as possible so that the money can actually go to some decent use.

But it IS a gamble to be honest.
At any point a 51% attack could happen crashing the vlaue, major governments could start outlawing BTC exchanges crashing the value and the price volatility...well at this point nobody bats an eyelid at 10% price swings.
There are any number of things that could completely kill bitcoin as an investment with no real warning.
So yes, BTC is a gamble even if I do support it and hope it succeeds.

Was the price at $1200 dollars 90% speculation driven by China? Yes.
There is no guarantee that the price will go above that point anytime soon...and this is from somebody who bought in at $1000 and has been hodling since.

I would assume he meant that there'd never be any reason to talk to strangers on the internet, which are "most people".
I mean think about it, if you use a phone, you're specifically calling somebody you know. It wasn't exactly easy to foresee the popularity of things that are populated by anonymous strangers, like reddit.
