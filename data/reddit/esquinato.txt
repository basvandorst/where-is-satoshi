@_date: 2019-07-18 03:09:05
Are you submitting the amount as a number or string? You may want to force that data type.
Also I remember from way back when (the last time I used bitcoin rcp) that you have to format the send amount as “0.0XXX” and you might be sending it as “.0XXX” which I believe used to produce an error.
Hope that helps

A Dapp (decentralized application) was created on the Ethereum network called Cryptokitties. The game works by assigning attributes to Cat Tokens that can then be mixed with other tokens to “breed“ new ones essentially. Being that these are all created on a blockchain, some traits are more rare than others and are looked at as more valuable.
This “game” created an insane backlog on ETH for the last few days.

At the current time, all accept my one cousin have all opted to keep them stored on their cold storage wallets I made them.
I explained to every one of them that the private key QR was "the keys to the castle" and as long as they kept them hidden they would be safe. I also took all precautions to create the wallets securely. 
I took down hand written copies of their private keys and locked them in my safe. No one asked me to destroy them even though I offered. Admittedly this method really only works with family and trustworthy people, but it worked for my family.

Googles Algorithms are based on a whole list of things. One of the main things that people don't realize it's based on is SERVER SPEED.
Example: If WeUseCoins.com is on some shitty VPS, and blockchain.info comes along and tosses up an EC2 Server for Bitcoin.com, google knows it can push more traffic at that site. Regardless of how long it's been around and how many back links it has. Domain matches exact search term + multiple plain text keywords on the home page + even some minor SEO will get you to the top with you own "bitcoin.com" AND the search team is "bitcoin". You'd actually have to really suck to NOT get to the top with gold like that.
The reality is Google puts higher bandwidth sites at the top of the list because they know they can send more traffic to the site. If they put sites with bad hosting at the top of the list, they will inevitably go slower/stop responding when a flood of bandwidth comes though. That makes GOOGLE look bad, for putting crappy sites at the top.
Just my 2 bits

This is very impressive but I'd like to know how safely the private key is stored in the iCloud Keychain. 
If you were able to get access to someone else's iCloud account, how easily would you be able to decrypt it? Is the file encrypted with your actual TouchID fingerprint or based on some sort of iCloud encryption externally of the phone itself?

I would just like to say, I gave away 10+ Paper wallets for Christmas and every single person in both sides of my family was excited. 
It was all over the news at that time, also the amount I gave each of them was not small, and notated on the back (as well as date and value for future tax purposes).
More than one person said the exact phrase "I'm excited to own some bitcoin". 
Every family event on either side since Christmas, I've gotten into awesome conversations with them about bitcoin and a few of them have purchased more and used their printed cold storage to store the new coin.
It's VERY important that you be present to EXPLAIN what you are giving them though. I feel that it would have been MUCH more tacky to just hand it over with no general explanation of what they just received. 
People can say its tacky all they want (and maybe it is) but they all seemed to love it. Just one experience.
@_date: 2014-08-30 18:37:28
11~ BTC for 7 TH
AntMiner S3 x 14 = 8.2 BTC = 7 TH
You'd have to buy 7 Power supplies setting you back another 1.5 BTC
Looks like other companies are finally catching up to BitMain however I'd still opt for separate devices because if that system fails, you loose 100% of your hashing power instead of ~7%.
I'm not anyway affiliated with BitMain other than owning a lot of their miners.
My two bits
@_date: 2014-09-22 22:19:51
I still mine and will continue to. If played correctly and breaking even on previous miners, I've been able to continue to profit.
However if I don't continue to upgrade while keeping my existing hashing power online I will eventually go negative.

4.7 BTC...... Talk about selling shovels.
I'm not normally one to complain about ROI but honestly you are better off buying two AntMiner s3s for 1.4 BTC. You'd get the same hashing power and a way better chance of not losing money.

Get a VPS on Digital Ocean (20/m). Cheapest/best VPS I've found. (VPS shouldn't be used for live projects though, just testing. You should always have a dedicated server once you are holding others BTC)
Any new linux distro will do.
Install "bitcoind", learn how the config file works. 
Get the RPC Library that matches your code of choice.
Learn how to make a truly secure login system, learn about bcrypt, get an SSL, hash your password submission before sending data from clients browser.
Securing the wallet: My preferred method is to install a virtual machine on the server, encrypt it's virtual drive and install bitcoind onto that for the live server. That way even if someone get's access to your server, they still need the password to your encrypted Virtual server inside the dedicated server. There are many other ways.
You don't want to make RPC command requests between two separate servers. You can, but if you do.. make sure you know what you are doing first. That data is sniffable by the right person, especially if its unencrypted or not tunneled correctly.
Start making magic happen =)

I completely agree with you on patenting the "new" technologies like Vault, but even that idea is a stretch compared to a Cold Wallet. They probably have some very patentable ideas internally however none seem to have made it into this round of patent submissions. Probably because they would be instantly cloned, implemented and stolen by all other Non-US exchanges/services. Thus making it WAY more valuable to be a trade secret then patented. Patents are so strange when dealing with software (I do it a lot).
PS I didn't downvote you. =)

@_date: 2015-09-23 22:14:55
I think you're missing the point and that is: It wasn't their idea to patent in the first place. It provably existed before the company came to be.
Does anyone hold the patent for the transfer of currency of any kind from person to person? Or the patent on the ability to hold money in your pocket? I doubt it. That's essentially (in my mind) what's going on here.

@_date: 2017-05-15 04:32:37
Genuinely asking and not talking shit or be sarcastic but if the BU people want a block size increase, why kick it down the road when that's the easy part? Segwit has way more potential issues I'd think right? A block size increase only requires everyone to update their bitcoind 
Edit: I know both require an update to the Bitcoin daemon, I'm just saying as far as ease of implementation... block size isn't hard. And Segwit adds lots of new features but also potential new attack vectors other than just spam. If everyone knows that a block size increase will eventually come, why wait?
@_date: 2017-05-15 03:42:48

The Library folder is hidden and in your specific user folder, not the "Users" folder.

Rules of the game:
How does it work? You simply make an account, and bet on one of
three tracks. Each track has exactly the same odds as any other.
There is no "House" in Bit-Race. You only bet against others
that have active bets. We take a 2% cut on all bets.
Bets Close at 1 Minute before race, and begin again one minute after
the last race is finished. Races run every 15 MINUTES.
0 Risk Betting
If you have money on a track, and the track that wins has 
no bets, all your coin is returned to you less 2% fee.
Race speed = 1 Random per second, 3 random numbers are generated.
The random number will always be between 1 and 20.
Every second a new random number is generated and added to
the track total. The first track to reach 701 or greater is the winner.
In the rare event of a race ending in a tie, the race will reset and re-run.
All three tracks have a chance to win (Even the non tie runner up of 
previous run).
Your share of the Pot is determined by your percentage share of 
the winning track's pot.

Sure I agree with all your points. It's been a sad day for freedom in the USA for a very long time.
However what was being done on the Silk Road was illegal by the current laws of the country in which they conducted business. So you already start off with a negative lean when &lt;Insert Talking head here&gt; starts talking about it.

Right! Run some ads on one of the 1000's of ad content sites. Who cares if you paid 50 dollars for one month of a subpage for some anime gallery site. That's a couple hundred people per day that just got exposed if not more. And they would have never been exposed if you hadn't put an ad there. Not to mention the "splash factor" of friends and family being exposed too from one single download/website view.
If advertising didn't work.... no one would be doing it. =)

Top Hijack: Just wanted to say thanks to those of you poking holes and giving me info. That's the only way this will ever truly be 100% secure. I really appreciate your help. I'm going to bed.
I've seen poeple make many mistakes in the last few years. Lot's of questions on many forums but no clear answers.... and generally bad/insecure code.
I come from a web security background and have been doing it for 15 years. I made a small site as an experiment for myself, and afterwards realized I had built a very nice little package for web developers.
Enjoy my friends!
Here's a list of some of the features.
Open Ended User IDs
By leaving the username open to both a custom name or an e-mail address, we give users the flexability to choose what kind of account name they would like. Some users don’t want to use their email addresses, and know the risks included in not using one (Not being able to reset a password among other things).
SHA256 based client side password encryption and salting.
Passwords are encrypted client side via javascript before they are transmitted to the web server. This ensures that your actual passphrase never gets transmitted from your computer. Essentially unless you have a key-logger installed on your computer… you’ll never be intercepted. All we store is an encrypted string and salt. SSL is still our friend and highly encouraged.
MySQLi, XSS protection and SQL injection protection.
A must to ensure a secure system, these will be some of the main focus points of the first write ups in the ramblings section. Detailed breakdowns and discussions encouraged.
Session ID regeneration and custom session functions for extra security.
Cut down on account spam almost instantly through regenerative session ids. Custom session variables with added session hashing to prevent session hijacks.
Brute Force Flagging
You are in charge of what you do with that though…. check out the login_check function for the brute force comments
JSONRPCPHP Based Bitcoind access.
Thanks to the people on that project for their contributions to the bitcoin community. This scripting is great, secure and practical even in large scale use (Provided you have the hardware).
Built in QR wallet addresses.
Cause dey perty.
Oh Yeah... and make sure to edit your bitcoin.conf file to pay transaction fees. The software assumes you are always paying the default .0005. Be kind to the network.
Edit2: just realized I forgot to package the SQL file up with the zip. Will fix after dinner. Sorry

This is peer to peer race betting, there is no house to be against (I couldn't back a house with enough to feel comfortable). So betting against yourself won't pay out.
That's all your original bets - house cut returned to you. Since technically you "won" it took the cut out.

I've tried to help with many bitcoin projects.
Every time the communication is horrible, follow up time on anyone "leading" the project is ridiculous. Every time they have just stopped contacting me and the project goes cold.
I'm hungry for new projects and this is the kind of response I get? Generally.... I don't even feel like trying to help others anymore because of it. I'll just continue to work on my own stuff.
What I'm trying to say is... bitcoin needs management... not programmers. There are tons of programmers waiting to help, but the douchebags with the jobs and the money are unreliable.
