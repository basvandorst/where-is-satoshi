Bitcoin wasn't based purely off of a bad joke at that time either.
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:53:21
It's more that we care about keeping our hotels nice when people decide to trash them or steal stuff.  Kind of hard to charge the person responsible when there's no credit card on file.  This may not be an issue in other parts of the world, or maybe they just don't care.  In the US it's a big issue.  People are shitty and it's stupid to just trust that everyone coming in to the hotel won't do anything bad.
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:28:30
If we don't have an ID and credit card that matches the name on your reservation, you aren't getting a room.  This is common sense liability stuff.  It's seriously blowing my mind that people don't understand how common this is in the US.
You could certainly still do this using a fake name, you'd probably just have to stay at a fleabag motel.
@_date: 2014-06-14 02:21:26
Good for you.  Most people here live in the US.  If this doesn't apply to you then there's no need to bitch about it.
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:47:57
The amount of people in here who know nothing about hotels is astounding.  
Let me break it down for you all.  You can certainly pay Expedia any way you want.  When you check in to the hotel, however, if you don't have a credit card, you will likely be turned away.  
Bitcoin is great for a lot of things and I am a huge supporter of it.  But if you honestly think the days of using credit cards in hotels is over then you can expect to not stay in a lot of hotels.  Having credit cards on file is a liability issue for hotels.  
Do you really think we are going to start checking in people with absolutely no way to charge them for drinks, food, long distance calls, damage, upgrades, or extensions?  Oh, you "aren't going to be using any of that" or you "will be using cash only"?  Too bad.  It's a requirement to cover our own ass.  Don't like it then you can go stay in a Motel 6 and get bedbugs.
@_date: 2014-06-11 22:10:24
They do.  It's on the website in the fine print that nobody bothers to read.  I have a printed copy of it at my front desk for people that say they were never told.  
I don't make the websites or the rules, man.  I simply follow them.  When you click "agree" or check the box or whatever it is, you agree to bring a credit card and put it down for incidental charges.  If you don't bring one, you don't get a room.  Sorry but that's really just the way it is.
Also, that's not even close to what business risk is.
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:24:23
It's more of a liability issue to cover the hotel in case the guest trashes the room or otherwise.  You might be able to pay Expedia with bitcoin but if thats all you have when you show up to my property?  Sorry, nope.  
I get where you're coming from but unless you actually work in hotels, you really don't know what you're talking about.  Having a credit card on file is pretty much the only way we can cover ourselves from people stealing everything in the room, trashing the room, or doing anything else that would require us charging them money.  
Yes, lots of hotels around the world don't do this.  We do in America because people are shitty.  :/
@_date: 2014-06-11 22:34:18
Oh, I totally get that.  Hotels in other parts of the world are a helluva lot easier to stay in than in the US.  We also require IDs to check in.  The ID also has to match the name on the reservation in addition to the credit card.  I don't know if people in the US just have no respect for hotels, or hotels abroad don't care about replacing damaged or stolen items, or what it is.  The rules regarding credit cards are pretty strict with my property.
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:51:11
In all honesty, paying in cash *is* usually a little suspicious.  Most of the people that try to pay cash only I have to end up turning away because they don't have a credit card or don't want to put one on file.
@_date: 2014-05-17 02:11:31
Same here.  Dogecoin has really surprised me to be quite honest.  The more exposure to cryptocurrencies, the better, I say!
@_date: 2014-04-03 09:18:54
Oh, I definitely agree.  It's just the whole 'doge' thing is pretty worn out, I think.  It'll make me chuckle every now and then but basing an entire currency on it seems ridiculous.  
You're right though.  If it gets more people into cryptocurrencies then I'm all for it.
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:39:54
Try reading the fine print that literally nobody reads.  It's there.  
The "insane" hold on credit cards is the full stay's payment (Got a good reason why this shouldn't be authorized?) plus a certain amount or certain amount per day of your stay for incidentals.  That secondary amount is different between hotels.  It's also put there to cover the hotel in case the guest trashes the room, steals things, charges food/drink to the room, makes long distance phone calls, or otherwise does anything that would require us to charge them.  It's a requirement for everyone.
The amount of butthurt in here is amazing.  It will be a cold day in hell when anybody thinks they will be able to stay in a hotel with only bitcoin and have no information on file that would allow the hotel to cover itself.
Go read the fine print.  You won't be able to check in to any reputable hotel in the US without a valid credit card.
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:17:10
No, it's not.  Any reputable hotel would require a credit card.  It's not to exclude people, it's to cover the hotel's ass in case the person wants to trash the room, steal something, or do anything else that would require us needing their information.
@_date: 2014-06-14 08:52:16
Oh wow, by a whopping &gt;5%.  I never said that this was the norm for the world.  I'm speaking from my own personal experience since I actually work in a hotel and most people here don't.  I'm sorry that you feel that matching IDs to reservations is a ridiculous notion.  Here in the US, it is common sense.  It makes sense to make sure people are who they say they are.  Stop acting as if the rest of the world is this golden paradise where everyone follows the rules and never does anything bad.
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:03:55
This is exactly right.  The only real reasoning behind this move is because they want to be the first to do it for the extra business and the fact that they will never have to do a bitcoin refund, ever.  Then who gets blamed for their fuck ups or dishonesty?  The hotel.
@_date: 2014-05-07 09:34:40
I don't get this whole rivalry thing.  
Why do you even think of it as one upping Dogecoin?  Why not sponsor a UFC fighter *and* the hackathons?  How could more exposure possibly even in the smallest, tiniest way, be worse?  
If we start seeing bitcoin, dogecoin, and possibly even other cryptocurrencies sponsoring events like these, no matter what they are, it will get more and more attention, probably more adoption, and acceptance.

Oh definitely. It could very possibly go much lower.  I was just recounting what I've seen happen tonight.  Seems to be on a steady upwind for the moment so there's probably going to be another big sell off when it gets close to $1000. (I'm guessing)
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:19:47

I've been fully verified since the 25th.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:04:24
Well, I'm in this for the long term.  I'm not planning on selling these anytime soon.  I just wanted to get them at a cheaper price than ~$1200 each.  This mini-crash allowed me to do that.  It is kind of annoying not getting them right away but in a couple weeks I'll have my 10 bitcoin instant buy limit.
I'm also awaiting verification with CampBX where I will be able to deposit money and buy/sell bitcoin instantly.  So there's that too.

It actually works pretty well in the world of Almost Human, too.  I was wondering when they would drop the B-bomb.
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:30:37
Gotcha.  Make sure you look up all of the transaction fees before you start so you know what to expect on that front.
CampBX I cannot tell you too much about since I am still awaiting verification and for the ACH deposits.  Currently the only ways to put money on your account would be through money orders or personal checks, both of which I don't want to deal with.  
It wouldn't be feasible to buy bitcoins from Coinbase and send them to CampBX though since they sell for quite a bit less (currently) on CampBX.  The price will probably even out pretty quickly once the ACH deposits are added for everyone.  Also, transaction fees have a say in the pricing as well.
Currently on Coinbase I have level 1 verification.  I can do weekly instant buys up to 0.1 bitcoin.  This is hopefully going to be increased in the future.  (It was 1 bitcoin just a few days ago, then lowered).  There is a 10 bitcoin daily limit for regular purchases which do take four days to reach your account.  I bought mine during the mini crash yesterday so the price I paid is locked in at the time of purchase.  Yes, it sucks to have to wait but if you don't need the coins immediately, it is probably the easiest or one of the easiest ways to get bitcoins in the US.
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:56:00
Glad you got it resolved.  Just a small word of advice and I'm truly not trying to be condescending here.  
Don't buy bitcoins you can't afford.  I realize you said there were some unforseen circumstances but you really need to make sure you have the money in your account to cover it and any other expenses you may incur.  Obviously I don't know what specifically happened so please don't take this as an attack on you.
I work in a hotel and can't even tell you how many times people's credit cards get declined after they deposited "The exact amount the website said it would cost" without thinking of taxes or incidental deposits.

@_date: 2013-11-30 06:38:01
I've been pretty disappointed with my Coinbase experience so far.  I got all of my verification done on the first day and decided to test the instant buy with a purchase of 0.01 btc.  They were around $800 each at that point. 
The "instant buy" transaction is still pending and I cannot make any more purchases until it's done.  I've watched the price break $1000, $1100, and now $1150+.  Pretty damn frustrating, especially since I emailed support the same day as the buy, sent messages to Coinbase personell on Reddit, and have still heard nothing.
I realize others have had no problems with them so I don't want to sound like I'm bashing them for no reason.  Just sharing my experience.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:13:32
I assume after this is done, that wallet is-what-it-is?  As in, I wouldn't want to use it for anything else until I want to move those coins?  
I assume it's still safe to send coins to it, I just wouldn't want to keep the actual .wallet file on my computer, correct?

A resume is definitely something worth keeping and updating.  You never know when you might want to submit it on a whim (Since you've been pondering).  I would imagine they're eager to hire people so it might be a good time to consider it.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:06:21
I'm honestly not sure then.  I would imagine they got pretty overloaded today so maybe they're just playing catch-up now.  Do you have level 2 verificaton (waited 30 days) or just level 1?  Level 1 allows 0.1 bitcoin per week while level 2 is 10.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:09:35
On any normal day they are pretty overloaded with the amount of traffic coming through.  During a crash like this?  It's amazing the website worked at all.  Sorry you had a bad experience but don't write off the whole thing because it's not working right during a time of the most highest usage.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:18:47
Definitely.  It will only do a market match if it specifically says so in a message that will pop up.  Otherwise, what you paid is what you paid and you *will* receive that amount of bitcoins for that amount of money.
You can also click "Limits and Verifications" to see if your level 2 verification has gone through.  If it hasn't it will say "Pending" next to the 30-day wait.

The credit card is a backup payment source in case you don't have the funds in your bank account to cover your purchase.  I imagine that entering your address is to help confirm your identity.  I've done all of this with zero problems thus far.

Have any sort of defense besides "Nu uh!" ?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:58:47
I had the same thing happen.  I believe it does this for your first transaction and after that one goes through, you should be able to do instant buy.  I was a little confused at first too because it never said anywhere "after your first transaction".  But I had my first one go through and now instant buy works fine for me.

I will completely admit that I initially got into this to get quick money.
Now that I've had a few weeks to actually learn about it and understand it better, I'm very excited for bitcoin's future.  It's very cool to see new posts every day with more businesses accepting bitcoin for payment.  At the rate it's popularity is growing, it seems like it only needs the backing of one big name to get the dominoes falling.  
Take a fast food restaurant chain, for example.  Implementing bitcoin payments would be a pretty big undertaking but think of the convenience for the customer and the profit for the company.  Being the first one to jump in to something like this would surge the popularity of bitcoin to crazy proportions.
I can't wait to see what the future holds.
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:09:55
Coinbase has been fine for me so far.  They aren't an exchange though so unless you become fully verified you won't be able to do instant buys.  Fully verified means you can buy 50 bitcoins per day (with a wait period of around ~4 days depending what day of the week you buy) and an additional 10 bitcoins per week with the instant buy option.  The amounts also slowly "refill" after a purchase, allowing you to purchase more.  Same goes for instant buy, it's just a smaller amount over a longer period.  
I am also awaiting verification with CampBX which is a US based exchange.  Soon they will be adding ACH deposits for all users (only available to veteran users currently as a test) and you will be able to deposit money straight from your bank to your account and instantly buy bitcoins.  I know they are quite small though with not a ton of volume just yet.  I imagine they will be expanding their operation as they get acclimated to the flood of new users coming in.
Btc-e can be very sketchy but it is currently one of the only ways to buy and trade altcoins.   If that is something that you are interested in, I would do a lot of research before putting money in.  There have been reports of them taking money, scamming users, and having very little customer support.  They are based in Russia (I believe?) so you can take that however you want.

I understand that.  My gripe is that I've been unable to buy any since I started this transaction and the price has been going up steadily.  I would have bought 10 the first day if I could have.  It won't let me buy anything until this transaction is complete.

I'm guessing it's going to settle around $500-$600, though it has been well above $600 for awhile now.  It will probably continue to go up from there, slowly but surely.
Realistically, we don't know.  Nobody does.  The value of bitcoin is affected greatly by news releases about it.  So the more good news, the higher it will go.  The more businesses accepting it, the higher it will go.

WOOO BITCOINS FOR FREE!  I read that correct, right? 
Just kidding, this is still awesome though.  Thanks Coinbase!
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:56:51
Well, that certainly is a lot of numbers.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:04:04
Don't listen to anyone but yourself.  Spend what you feel comfortable spending on it.  If it goes too high for you, try buying fractions of bitcoins at a time.  If you think it will go back down, then wait and buy a full coin at once.  Nobody on reddit knows what will happen.  Trust your own instincts.

I actually haven't been to one in several years so I may have to try it out again.  
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:07:41
Level 2 verification has a weekly instant buy limit of 10 bitcoins.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:46:28
Thanks for the help!  Looks like I'll be creating several USB wallets once my coins come in.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:06:26
So their whole "Get verified and buy bitcoin in minutes" is just a bunch of BS?
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:20:50
The Chinese people have a lot of money too.  They can still buy and sell bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:32:20
I thought it was pretty funny too but it's probably more appropriate for @_date: 2013-11-28 22:30:01
Not that I can remember.  It linked just fine for me.  I would guess that it might not find it yet if it's a brand new account.  Maybe it takes a couple of days to get 'in the system' so to speak.  I have no idea though, sorry :/
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:48:51
Yes, I do.  I have all of my verification done through level 2 aside from the 30 day wait.  
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:31:30
Exactly.  There's no way to know what the code is until you scan it.  People could print giant QR codes that link to goatse or some other offensive website and get it on TV.  That would be very bad for the venue and whatever channel it's on.  It has nothing to do with bitcoin.
People saw that the first guy that did this got a lot of money and now want to jump on the bandwagon.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:56:22
Yes, it is locked unless they specifically say otherwise.  I also buy from Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:35:25
Is there a pitchfork store that accepts bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-13 06:18:40
We've finally made it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:46:37
Must be that perspective.  Thank you for the tip, it's appreciated!  That's actually more than double what I currently have in btc at the moment.  Those faucet sites don't pay out very much.  (For obvious reasons)
Thanks again!

I don't think people realize how small the Coinbase staff is and how many people are currently using the website.  It took them a week to get back to me with my issue.  I don't blame them, they're being slammed every single day.
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:47:23
Good deal, I look forward to it!
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:51:06
At this point it seems like it will just be driven underground in China unless there is an outright ban.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:13:07
IM RICH!
