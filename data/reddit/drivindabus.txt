I would do so...for a fee :)

I did come across one random site that said it took Bitcoin but you had to pay via Coinbase account.  Like, no direct address at all.  I'm assuming it was so they could try to bill you monthly.

Twobitidiot? That fool is still writing?

ITT: People declaring they want to support the Bitcoin economy, but come up with a thousand excuses to not actually do so.
I've managed to completely avoid Amazon for the last 8 months or so, so you US-based hypocrites have no excuses.

I imagine that what's wrong is the circlejerk.

I love Famous Amos. He ^*chirp* is letting us see in real time how fast someone finds ^*chirp* out about bitcoin, learns how it works, and gets ^*chirp* hooked on it.  Now he is spreading the word! We ^*chirp* need more people like him in our community.

There's a bunch of places near St. Petersburg that just started accepting BTC for the upcoming Bitcoin Bowl.

Enough of the good news already! I can't stand the price going any lower :(

You're talking about a different thing then. If they dump all their coin then we buy them all.  If anyone is in "control" it's the miners, but even then they aren't really in control. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 21:56:30
Largest holder != control.

I agree. It's strange that mods are ok with so many people disrupting conversations here with only the argument "It's so hard to ban people sometimes".  And while we may be able to ignore them, newbies don't know who has what reputation so that doesn't help them any.

Don't play stupid. It is not good for your image. That's kinda  rule of PR.
The  rule of PR, if you're wondering, is don't support or promote obvious scams.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:14:42
Jesus christ. It's no wonder MtGox got as far along as it did. You assholes will support any scam no matter how obvious it is.  Fuck you. Fuck you for making Bitcoin worse.

It appears that is no longer the case. He made his bed and now he can go fuck himself in it.

20-80%? That means nothing. You might as well say 0-100% chance!

Are you one of those people that think if it's not literally the thing you're talking about then it is in no way a useful example? He didn't claim it was a 1:1 correlation. 
Or maybe you're just an idiot. I don't know you personally.
@_date: 2015-07-29 14:25:36
Holy shit, did I say they were incomparable? They are comparable. A bit different, sure, but it is a *comparison*.  God damn.
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:13:57
If people continue to tell you that you're wrong over and over maybe it's because you're wrong. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 17:11:25
It's probably because all these alts don't actually do anything.
Are people free to make alts? Yea, no durr. 
Are people allowed to call them out for being garbage and at best redundant but most likely pump and dump schemes? Yes.  You should be encouraged to call them out!
If something truly innovative came along and wasn't an obvious pump/dump you'd know it right away because Bitcoin would be dead instantly.
So, please, don't try to fake that you're taking the high road. Because your not.

Man, I remember how people flipped the eff out when that site came online.  BITCOIN IS OVER! IT'S ALL BEEN HACKED! lololol
