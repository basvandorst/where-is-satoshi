Even putting 15 grand into hardware and space? There must be a point where with enough money you can run a profit over time.

What about mining a less popular crypto that might grow? Like ETH?

in cloud mining... not bitcoin

He's already made a lot of money. He invested 5,000 and made 30 a day for 2 years, so more than doubled his money.

Thank you very much.

Well I live with my grandmother who's trust is overfunded by about 15,000 and she pays for the electricity. She's not doing well and once she passes that 15,000 will go to the government. So I'd be better off using the electricity and getting the cryptos in my pocket over the government getting her money.

I'm aware of the techniques firms use. I tried a month long imaginary trading session where I started with 1,000 and I'm at an imaginary 5,400.

Well I mean it's a currency, not a stock. So wouldn't it always continue to go up if there's constantly more and more uses for it?
A business can do badly and lose stock value, but the more BTC gets used it can only do well, right? It's not even a very popular thing yet, it can get way bigger from here.

I don't have any idea about it. I sat down with my mom dad and a lawyer and listened. When I asked my parents about it they told me that we don't get to inherit what's in her trust, it goes to the government when she dies. So that's 15,000 that would go to waste that I could take for myself by using more power, since she pays that bill.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:37:38
Well what about other currencies like XMR or ETH or LTC?
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:50:30
The reason I'm asking is because I've only bought BTC with video game gold and I didn't know if there was something better.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:39:32
I meant like.. is Coinbase a good website to buy/sell or is there a better site. I wasn't looking for techniques.
@_date: 2018-06-17 08:39:33
So as long as the buyer is informed it won't be an issue to sell it. Gotcha. Thank you.

It can't go up forever.. I'm just wondering how much it can go up to.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:50:04
I put $900 into it a month ago and it's worth $3,300 now. I'm actually pretty upset I didn't put more into it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:46:05
I put 1000 dollars into it during a crash a month ago when it hit 3000, and I made 2k profit. Pretty happy.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:19:49
Stocks level off at certain values until the company does something significant to boost the value of the company. Bitcoin is shooting up 1-2k a day, when will it level off?

Thanks for that! I got my 0.84 USD from my old MultiBit wallet.
How does this work exactly? I followed a tutorial that took my old wallet's seed, and it magically found the coins without looking for my files at all. What do my MultiBit files even do then? How did it find my coins just with my seed?
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:55:10
Yeah, I might do some more reading. I've just never felt the need to get too deep into it because I've used it for more than 5,000 dollars and I'm kinda used to how it works, but I will read more into it just because I'm interested.
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:29:59
MultiBit no longer exists. There is nothing to install.
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:28:57
That’s why I was asking dipshit. You're also wrong yourself. There are companies you can hire to mine certain transactions to get them to move along faster. So get off your fucking high horse.
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:44:41
My post was a question. Your answer was not totally accurate after I researched. You responded like a righteous cunt when I was obviously asking a question. You weren't completely right either.
Go fuck yourself.

I wonder if he died. Surely he'd touch them and probably even tell the world who he is.
@_date: 2018-04-18 06:44:44
There's nothing that could hurt him with the public knowing though.
I don't get it.
@_date: 2018-04-18 06:02:35
If he sold 8 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin he'd kill it instantly.
@_date: 2018-04-18 06:28:08
A target for what? Fame? Even more money?
@_date: 2018-04-18 08:49:25
I like shitposting it gives me things to reply to.
