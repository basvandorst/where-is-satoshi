Im only speaking out of curiosity now, but what might this type of cover cost in the US or UK for say, $10m cover? I appreciate there are many variables here

This is very gentlemen!

I didnt realise you could have multiple wallets created from a single seed. 
So the password string and seed combined creates a new set of private keys?

You sir, are drunk with morality, The question was prevention, the paying was a hypothetical.
You've watched too many movies 
@_date: 2014-12-14 09:23:07

@_date: 2014-12-08 16:01:13
haha amazing
@_date: 2014-12-13 23:22:59
of course yes, I manically test all wallets before I transfer any significant amount of bitcoin.. thanks man
@_date: 2014-12-14 09:24:40
Yeah maybe that's why he just disappeared, that.. or the other obvious reason
@_date: 2014-12-18 20:57:37
yes, and its an obvious move. Lets move all torrent trackers to a decentralised system. Then we will no longer need a piratebay
@_date: 2014-12-13 20:32:31
Needs to support coinbase/wallet import and multisig
@_date: 2014-12-14 16:01:38
Yeah, I was thinking the same, I woke up to his comment and made me feel a bit queezy.. Never been called evil, selfish or creepy before
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:36:39
erm, yeah I wont be using a Bwallet, im happy with both my trezors
@_date: 2015-02-11 09:25:46
Yeah its amazing they took all that time to write an article without even asking someone how this can be countered. multi-sig with either time delay or behavior spending algorithms can assist with this. 
I also see the disabled the comments on the wired page

when you go to a foreign exchange do you buy your currency or exchange your currency?
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:16:10
Exactly, We still need to solve the problem of custody and trust. Coinbase is the best we have for the masses
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:14:37
Not really tho, altcoins share most of the advantages that the dollar doesnt
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:30:36
Multi-sig wallet
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:15:45
very true (and most of us too ;) )
@_date: 2015-02-04 13:48:22
maybe, but its going to be around for a few more years yet and its the platform we need to get mainstream adoption
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:31:51
I really dont care about june 2015, see you in 2019
@_date: 2015-02-24 14:33:01
if you are using bitcoin solely to make money from market trading then yes.
