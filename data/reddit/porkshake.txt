I'll literally cut off my own toenail and throw it away if bitcoin gains another US dollar of value in the next microsecond.

Most fiat doesn't exist as paper money. When it comes to Bitcoin, won't this type of artificial inflation, futures, and IOU's dilute the value? Won't the existence of satoshi denominations and other coins dilute the value? How does Bitcoin's value weather the storm of dilution on all fronts?

I just want BTCP to cream BCH in market share.

Bitcoin is not a stock, but I’m going to invest some money in it as if it were a stock because I enjoy the little meme of the coin riding the roller coaster straight up.
