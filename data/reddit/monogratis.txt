I agree, quit with the BS. You aren't helping the community by constantly repeating stupid shit without thinking first.

I agree. It's very sad to see someone who could support SegWit and developers, but choose to play politics.

There are thousands of altcoins. Why would anyone use yours? Don't waste your time. I guarantee you this will be a fruitless endeavor.
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:09:40
Yes, the use case you described would be on chain. But don't limit yourself to thinking in absolutes. Remember you can always instantly trade a key pair. LN will provide opportunities for prepaid payments, so all you need to do is hand them the key and they can choose to settle it.

@_date: 2017-04-29 05:18:49
No. The BU developers are idiots and a waste of money. Besides, the 500k figure is not about paying devs. It's about running a cloud mining service and paying 30 staff to run his website that has gone into scam territory.

Complaining about a hard fork while a soft fork that is backwards compatible that is ready to deploy isn't brave, it's intellectually dishonest.
There's no reason not to soft fork SegWit at this point.

You came here with an agenda to tell us LN is vaporware, which we know is false. Do you expect to be taken seriously?
Now, I personally have been waiting patiently for LN so that I can open channels with exchanges and perform HFT arbitrage.
That is the use case that brings us a $1 trillion market cap, and makes LN extremely liquid.

Hard forks are fine -- for altcoins. We don't want to make it easy to change Bitcoin because a developer says "hey everyone run my binary", but we want it to be possible with the proper consensus.
I'm not against BU because it's a hard fork. I'm against it because EC is a horrible solution.

Stop "in their mind" crap. It's in your mind, not theirs. You don't know what all Core devs think, and many have said they would raise legacy block size.

When u/nullc ?
When will Core release something that has a chance of uniting this community?
@_date: 2017-04-29 13:44:55
Not necessarily.  If you are sending to a friend whom you trust then you can open the payment channel on both ends yourself. Essentially a prepaid channel that you can give your friend access to the keys on the other end. Prepaid channels :)
Exchanges and web wallets such as Blockchain will be using LN between their wallets. What if he opened an account at an exchange​ or web wallet that had an open channel with another exchange or web wallet? The payment could be instant between some wallets and exchanges if those services have open channels.

@_date: 2017-04-14 14:01:39
I want SegWit. That's all I want. We need the developers to push it through either HF or UASF.
@_date: 2017-04-21 21:21:01
Stop. Be glad that the Litecoin community and developers are now in communication with miners. This is a good thing for the ecosystem. There's many layers of power, and this shows that people can work together to make agreements and move forward. The realities might change later, once we have more use cases for LTC. All the miners wanted was an agreement that their interests would be respected while the block reward subsidy is still in effect
@_date: 2017-04-18 14:24:26
So why do they need to test them on the Litecoin mainnet? Ever wonder that? There's plenty of scrypt coins they could mine. Or they could point them to a testnet.
@_date: 2017-04-25 01:44:53
I think there is a guy named Roger who might invest in this most brilliant idea.

I agree. Read only unless you are approved submitter. Technically Reddit could work for this
@_date: 2017-04-21 02:17:23
It sounds like we need a very good visual comparison of SegWit vs. Extension Blocks to make it easy for layman to distinguish between the witness "block" and the extension block. In fact, it seems that the very problem is that this was referred to as a block by some but it's not a block in itself. It merely rearranges data in the block ( in a backwards compatible way)
@_date: 2017-04-24 01:53:42

Mods can you delete this. This did not happen.
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:01:33
LN does increase non-trusted tx, but not in this one use case you describe.
Look it's very simple. I open a channel with a large payment hub, this payment hub has channels with other payment hubs. I basically now have a prepaid bank account that I control the keys to in my pocket. I can now go swipe my phone at any merchant and make instant secure payments, millions of them if I want, and whenever I close the channel it settles back to main chain address. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 15:13:21
I think it's more simple. He just doesn't understand why or how Bitcoin works. It's ironic a self proclaimed anarchocapitalist would not agree with self determination of Bitcoin users. Nodes are what check the power in Bitcoin. They are absolute critical.

@_date: 2017-04-16 22:36:14
Miners working with developers, exchanges, and companies is preferable to a UASF. Jihan is really the one responsible for blocking the blocksize increase and tx malleability fix, that SegWit provides with a backwards compatible upgrade.
@_date: 2017-04-16 22:34:41
It really hasn't risen for a while. There's also quite a bit of variance. At the moment, it looks like SegWit support is rising on BTC and LTC. I believe it is also possible to signal for both, which may be occuring

Why not just soft fork SegWit in now? Its ready and is backwards compatible.
Hard fork can come after that.

@_date: 2017-04-23 13:37:33
Emin didn't just propose an idea, he actively criticized Core and bashed SegWit while offering no real solution. The solution he did offer he wanted to monetize, and not release as an open source .

Lol. Ok dude.
@_date: 2017-04-29 13:27:30
LN doesn't compete with transactions, it extends the reach of transactions by allowing millions of payments to occur within one regular transaction. When a service is faster, cheaper, and easier to use, it opens up the door to build a new market. Just look at Uber and how many more people use cars for hire now.
@_date: 2017-04-20 00:43:48
Upvoted even though there is no proof of this. We have yet to have any user determined soft fork, or user activates features. Historically, this was done through a hard fork with altcoins where users specifically ran code that was guaranteed to enact those changes, despite what miners want. We need user activates soft forks with a flag day. I don't think we will get this, possibly ever.
@_date: 2017-04-30 13:43:12
They would always prefer to focus on trying to change the subject 
The question is: Why don't we just soft fork SegWit in now?
It's ready and it's backwards compatible.
@_date: 2017-04-13 04:57:56
It's not just about scaling. I should not have to explain this. Do your research.

Low fees are not a guarantee of PoW. Decentralization and security are though.
@_date: 2017-04-15 23:41:43
Thanks for clarifying. I know they have nothing to do with each other. I was pointing out that SegWit solves respective problems for both SPV and HW wallets relates to input verifications. For HW wallets this saves processing time. For SPV this allows better and safer pruning , reducing bandwidth and storage costs without giving up security
@_date: 2017-04-24 01:51:04
Your truth isn't my truth.
@_date: 2017-04-15 21:39:26

How do I get paid for this?
@_date: 2017-04-30 13:55:00
That's not accurate at all. But yes you can use an old phone for storage, just make sure it's encrypted.
@_date: 2017-04-15 22:50:48
No. SPV nodes would simply require less bandwidth and storage since they can safely prune the blockchain without reducing security. Currently, they have to check all the inputs. But with SegWit, the witness data is hashed into the transaction itself. This aspect of a Segwit block basically kills 3 birds with one stone. Tx malleability fixed (making zero conf exponentially safer), hardware wallets can sign a tx knowing all the inputs are valid without having to do as much checking, and SPV can prune while not reducing security.
@_date: 2017-04-29 13:31:22
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:41:48
Okay. Keep your eye in Litecoin...
@_date: 2017-04-29 13:58:03
So send your friend an on-chain tx. SegWit more than doubles on-chain capacity as it stands.
Also, I'm not talking about two Coinbase accounts, I'm talking about two different exchanges using LN.
@_date: 2017-04-22 16:30:22
You don't know that. Some miners don't want dynamic.
@_date: 2017-04-16 23:58:10
Litecoin is a little more important at the moment.
@_date: 2017-04-16 22:40:48
It's not the developers fault. Miners have intentionally blocked the upgrade for political reasons.
@_date: 2017-04-15 14:09:59
Yes, when it is relevant to BTC. Just like we discussed Viacoin when features from that were added to Bitcoin.  In this case, Litecoin is the ideal coin for SegWit, so we should discuss it because it is relevant to Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-04-15 14:11:21
Don't forget you can also rent hashpower from nicehash.com

Wang Chun is awesome. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 21:28:46
He didn't give anything but his word that he would work with them to prevent network stagnation while there is a block subsidy in effect.
@_date: 2017-04-20 00:31:09
Who cares. I am not interested in giving miners more control. They already abuse their power. I am also not interested in adding more variables to the consensus layer. BU should be tested on an altcoin, or better yet, they should hard fork and compete legitimately, if they can't follow the BIP process and perform proper code review and criticisms.
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:56:16
It's not on-chain vs. off-chain. The two work together to scale. On-chain interface with off-chain solutions provides Privacy, fungibility, user friendly payments, time-stamping and info storage. Lightning networks can accommodate many if the services that would normally clog up the mempools. It's not competition, it's actually synergy to create more use cases and better user experience.
@_date: 2017-04-25 01:49:11
@_date: 2017-04-16 23:14:13
Nice strawman mixed with concern trolling. There are many applications of Lightning. Ethan Heilman has already discussed combining TumbleBit with Lightning, to increase privacy and security. I think this is simply beyond your ability to understand that the smartest people in Bitcoin have already thought about and are developing solutions to your concerns. Nick Szabo, Bram Cohen, Nicholas Dorier, are a handful of those who regularly discuss these issues in public presentations. You could educate yourself, or you could spend all day trolling on Reddit.
@_date: 2017-04-13 04:57:01
Yes. Nicholas Dorier has already said he will port nBitcoin to Litecoin, which also means nTumblebit will be ported. It's very easy to port anything from Bitcoin to Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:33:59
Okay, now you lie again. All good news about LN is not fake. LN payments are being tested everyday on testnet. Many people are working for free on it. And furthermore, LN is meant to be one part of a larger scaling solution that includes on-chain scaling, MAST, sidechains, LN, tumblebit, and more. 
Please stop with the hate . Hundreds of developers have been actively working to solve this and you sowing FUD in the community isn't helpful.
It is okay to be devil's advocate but not try to hurt the community by attacking
@_date: 2017-04-16 23:49:56
Backwards and forwards compatibility are critical here because it's not just a decentralized network, it's a decentralized consensus critical financial network.
@_date: 2017-04-16 22:42:37
It's not an altcoin unless it changes consensus. SegWit is a backwards compatible upgrade, that's why it's not an altcoin. Altcoins would non-backwards compatible competing chain

@_date: 2017-04-15 23:00:39
I think I answered your question. It doesn't matter if you hard fork or soft fork SegWit. There's very little difference in how it affects the properties of SegWit. There's just a difference in where the witness is stored, there's pros and cons, but the important thing is that soft fork SegWit is backwards compatible
@_date: 2017-04-16 15:29:09

UASF is completely safe with proper lead time. A clear majority of nodes are running Core 13.1+ so it's only the issue of a chain split and whether anyone would support a BU shitcoin.

This is false. Johnson Lau and Nicholas Dorier both said they will be working on Lightning and Tumblebit for Litecoin once SegWit activates.
This is very good for Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin community should not be bitter it bash Litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 15:08:15
I support my own self interests too. I know the Bitcoin codebase very well, and I run a node flagging for UASF and I mine on SegWit pool. 
I also want bigger blocks, but I have learned that SegWit provides the bigger blocks we need, and SegWit solves transaction malleability bug which is critical for next generation development on Bitcoin.

Miners are paid a subsidy. Called nSubsidy. It's part of the block rewards that includes fees. They are paid for their work, and that's all. Nothing more. If they don't want the work, or if they want to work for another chain, they are welcome to make that choice.

dApps have nothing to do with tokens. You don't need any tokens outside of the native BTC or ETH to make or run a dApp. Ethereum tokens are mostly just scams to monetize speculation about the potential for an app.  You only need one token for all dApps, which is the native coin on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:56:24
This is pretty amateur logic. A hard fork guarantees older nodes are booted. SegWit allows old nodes to operate and they still see the blocks and download them. They can continue making transactions as well. This guarantees they don't lose coins and can continue operating in business. A hard fork is just forcing users to upgrade, there's no consensus whatsoever in that.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:29:23
That's not true, and SegWit increases block size by the way.
@_date: 2017-05-02 02:30:19
Eheheh you wish
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:52:51
I love Samourai. I like the way that Mycelium works and shows transaction history. It's really easy to manage, but I trust Samourai WAY more.
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:04:50
So what is the largest safe blocksize? Should we leave open an attack vector under the guise that nobody will waste money doing it? What if a pool is hacked or a government takes over a large mining facility and this attack vector is exploited?
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:58:12
Remember there's an infinite number of dollars, but only so much Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-20 14:22:54
Litecoin proves that SegWit is perfectly safe, despite so much FUD from haters.
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:21:44
Yes, Lightning scales it to hundreds of millions of tx. Just watch Litecoin in one week. You will see first Lightning txs there.
@_date: 2017-05-11 02:00:47
Right. If anything, Litecoin will simply help Bitcoin development continue onward.
@_date: 2017-05-02 01:47:12
I recently was a consultant for a large start up. I realize now how hard it is for these companies to find good consultants to answer questions for an hour or two at a time. This is a great opportunity for  specialized consultants to offer microconsulting services on the side.
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:46:14
Why are you being disingenuous?
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:55:40
It won't hurt to do both.
@_date: 2017-05-07 16:50:01
Not really. It had to do with Luke-jr figuring out how to soft fork SegWit.  Before that, Adam Back proposed a 2-4-8 increase.
Once it became possible to soft fork both SegWit and a block size increase, that's what happened.
Today's SegWit IS a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:40:28
It's not possible to ever have 100% agreement amongst nodes. We could get to 98% maybe. It's easier to have unanimous agreement with miners. Even in the case of Litecoin it could only get about 99% of blocks due to a few small pools that didn't signal
@_date: 2017-05-03 14:37:19
Lol, if you're so tired of it then why are you on Reddit?
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:03:43
The current interfaces involve a mix of GUI and command line. I am expecting a fully functional desktop GUI Lightning wallet within two weeks for Litecoin.
Mobile will be a little different, of course, but there are people working on that at the moment.
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:32:51
For the record, Ripple and other blockchains with tokens went through the same exact token scams in their heyday.
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:28:13
It's entirely possible to support both but BU has no interest in lightning or complex scripting 
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:37:06
They weren't considered a coin. Still aren't. But fuck it.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:59:03
It's not dumb. It's an achievement because it is the first time on history users of a cryptocurrency have upgraded the protocol technology in a  significant way without a centralised authority.
It's really the most significant decentralized fintech event yet.

Got UASF binaries?
@_date: 2017-05-03 04:29:39
Why is it frightening? Most Core supporters want on-chain scaling and consensus. We are perfectly happy with the Core software and don't want to run buggy untested code.
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:08:05
I agree. I bought LTC at $10 and will continue hodling to support Bitcoin, Litecoin, and SegWit.
@_date: 2017-05-03 04:34:06
You are correct sir.
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:34:26
There's nothing against Satoshi. The problem is people paraphrasing or taking Satoshi out of context to push an agenda. Sort of like how some U.S. politicians talk about "the founding fathers" to support their agenda
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:26:50
It's not a bad thing. It's a good thing that Litecoin can help push Bitcoin forward.
@_date: 2017-05-18 03:17:22
It's a matter of security as well. SegWit will help reduce fees and increase  blocksize. Second layers with micropayments after that.
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:33:28
Cool thx for heads up. BTFD
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:57:15
Maybe for a few days. Nothing we haven't seen before. Once they are in SegWit though it's smooth sailing. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 15:37:17
Fuck yeah!!!!!
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:24:04
I agree. Could be someone just trying to fuck with the graphs. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 16:32:17
Extension Blocks in the original proposal were okay, and proposal supported SegWit. The new proposal is not good.
Extension Blocks is like having two chains on one chain, and you have to exchange bitcoins between chains. It's not good.
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:34:16
Bitcoin doesn't work for doing better scripting, because of transaction malleability. We must upgrade Bitcoin to extend its' value by many orders of magnitude.
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:31:31
Both of you need to stop. The miners didn't say that, and Blockstream has nothing to do with it.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:47:03
Quit your whining. What people want is not always what people get, that's the lesson in life. Learn to work with others not complain. We are upgrading the protocol with or without you.  
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:01:17
I'll stick with BIP148 because it will move us forward. No more talk. Just do it.
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:35:30
All hard fork clients break consensus if activated.  The point is these were attempted takeovers of the network that we're being promoted outside of the BIP process.
BIP process was developed to give merit to ideas and have developer discussion. When a couple devs decided they wanted to do something different than the dozens of others, they were told their clients would not be allowed on the Bitcoin subreddit. Anywhere is fine, but subreddits are not democracies they are troll heavy shit post forums and need to be moderated or they turn into pure shit like rBTC
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:56:01
Exactly. As a preventative measure as well, Don't make any transactions until more than 200 blocks after BIP148 activates to verify the chain integrity
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:13:37
Lol yes ironic this is actually a win for miners too.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:16:32
Yes I've been under a rock
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:32:53
But you don't know for sure?
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:38:49
Ah I see . Yes fair enough
@_date: 2017-05-02 01:42:10
Sure, but this is actually a great idea. It is very difficult for companies around the world to find good consultants, especially in emerging technologies. This removes the need for agencies and provides a direct correspondence between a business owner and a high quality vetted consultant.
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:05:58
I think most of us have lost patience with liars and trolls on Reddit, that take every chance to sow discord and spread misinformation. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:07:19
I did that a month ago. Pretty good decision. My intention was to support SegWit though,.because I love Bitcoin. I also rented hashpower to signal SegWit, and thankfully Charlie made it happen.
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:26:14
How about both :)
@_date: 2017-05-03 04:36:55
Good questions. Will there be additional coins in the EB? ExtCoins? 
@_date: 2017-05-07 16:34:36
And the only thing preventing that power from getting more centralized is PoW.
PoS would literally destroy that last defense
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:35:06
It is actually 100% certain that SegWit will be adopted on Bitcoin come August 1st.
@_date: 2017-05-08 01:11:30
I recommend to Ignore them and move along
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:28:59
Lightning doesn't compete with regular transactions much, it creates new use cases and will exponentially increase value of a blockchain.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:00:32
Good job
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:32:57
Precisely. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:30:57
Lol. Yeah let's give up on years of compromise and start over. Amirite?
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:07:42
Lolol. Scammers.
@_date: 2017-05-07 16:40:06
I don't think this is the case
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:07:18
Just run BIP148.
This took years to get here after much peer review and consensus discussion. If you want SegWit, it's perfectly safe to run BIP148.
In fact, at this point I would say those not running BIP148 are holding the grenade.
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:19:27
There is currently no market for smart contracts.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:49:33
Ever heard of Peter Rizun? He's given speeches about removing the 21m BTC cap so we can have inflation pay the fees.
Peter was on that stage.
@_date: 2017-05-08 01:09:31
Yes that's right. We should move to L2 to make it cheaper and faster.
@_date: 2017-05-11 02:06:34
take note
@_date: 2017-05-01 05:46:52
SegWit blocks can be up to 4mb in size. Core is increasing the size limit, just not using the max_block_size parameter. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:04:04
Perhaps knowing that running a node makes a difference. I'm not worried about those running alt nodes, they would be drowned out.
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:30:52
Ooh temporary private tx until block explorers updated :P
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:55:35
Don't mine. Just figure out how to get a cash and buy BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-03 04:32:58
Extension Blocks aren't that interesting given the downsides
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:22:43
Eh..  even that comparison will go to Roger's head...
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:58:13
Actually, the transaction Luke is referring to used onion routing, so LN is basically ready for production.
@_date: 2017-05-03 14:30:49
Lol. Scammers going to scam.
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:00:07
If course they will. Lightning GUI wallets are almost production ready.
@_date: 2017-05-07 05:30:53
You don't have to put blind faith. The code is open source along with the dev mailing list 
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:30:49

You are a good scammer already.
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:25:10
The ideas were always discussed. It went too far when consensus breaking clients were introduced
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:38:23
Glad we agreed :)
@_date: 2017-05-07 16:54:27
Okay then we'll just wait one more week for Lightning on Litecoin.
Good idea bud.
@_date: 2017-05-06 02:30:16
Lightning wallets would help them a lot. Especially remittance

@_date: 2017-05-06 22:15:50
SegWit has been on testnet over a year and is most tested upgrade in Bitcoin history.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:34:03
It is already 100% certain that Bitcoin will adopt SegWit through  
Whether miners split the chain is up to them now.
@_date: 2017-05-22 00:43:40
I hope he is doing okay.
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:10:06
This isn't a proof of stake network so Roger can take his coins and shove them. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:53:58
The federated model isn't really a problem at his time imo. The plan is to transition from federated to decentralized, but this requires some infrastructure built out first. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:56:30
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:14:31
Sounds good then. Let's activate SegWit and increase the blocksize then.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:05:51
Because it was not a soft fork. SegWit as a soft fork so it is forwards and backwards compatible.
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:24:37
Yes it still breaks consensus, as it would fork off older clients. This is only really necessary in the case of a bug, such as the overflow bug. Hard fork really don't need to be used for upgrades anymore.
Now that we know how to increase blocksize without a hard fork, through the soft fork using SegWit block weight, we shouldn't need to hard fork unless we encounter bugs or serious limitation.
@_date: 2017-05-07 19:07:39
Absolutely. Have you heard of high frequency trading? Arbitrage opportunities galore once LN is live.
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:54:03
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:14:38
We are on the same side actually. It's not about Core or Blockstream. It's about pride. Miners have too much pride to allow developers to upgrade the protocol.
Miners are the biggest hurdle. It's how Bitcoin was designed. So blame Satoshi not Core
With SegWit activated on Litecoin and NO issues, why are they not already signalling on Bitcoin???
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:39:58
Quite brilliant yes
@_date: 2017-05-14 06:05:35
Jaxx is a decent wallet. Getting better every update.  Would like to see the focus be on Rootstock and Lightning
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:15:19
Even better. Never store any bitcoins on a node
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:52:41
Lol. Congrats dude.
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:16:49
Hell yes brotha
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:36:00
Well, only one coin will retain the BTC ticker. The coin that retains more PoW, higher price, and ticker is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:35:26

There's a ~$2 mm Litecoin bounty to steal from a SegWit address ... 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:02:30
Yeah. I agree. At this point, while I respect the Core developer talent, I am okay with btc1 becoming next reference implementation. I'm not going to use Luke's coin or anyone else coin. 
I will use Bitcoin. Honestly, I think this entire debate and scaling problem is been very good for Bitcoin long term. Regardless of how painful it has been to watch and hodl through.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:22:47
I don't have any use for ETH
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:01:11
Yes. Not only that, he has advocated for launching altcoins using the Bitcoin merkle root, in order to inflate the supply.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:37:15
Some people can't see the long term. What's happening in the next 6 months is not that important.
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:13:26

Buy time :) I'll be cost averaging 
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:26:41
There is always a block size limitation. The question is how to have consensus around block size, and whether it should be static or dynamic. I think static is better
@_date: 2017-05-09 01:59:19
Please stop JAXX from adding more scam tokens and shitcoins.
We don't need that kind of functionality. The app is laggy enough as it is.

@_date: 2017-05-19 04:25:13
Fuck yes dude!!!!
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:16:40
Who knows. I think the miners need support from exchanges. Most exchanges seem to support the compromise. If miners reneg on commitment, that would create complete distrust.
The miners and major exchanges are both cooperating together, so I don't expect a problem for SegWit.
The question remains what happens at time of hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 02:35:45
Yes, and the Clinton family was one of the greatest friends of wahabbists in Saudi Arabia - providing no shortage of proxy funding.

There's a lot of people who think we couldn't have had such economic growth without the Fed. I disagree. I believe our technologies are what bring prosperity and wealth, not money printers. But alas, economists take credit for things without any proof all the time. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:55:30
There's already more UASF  nodes than BU .  Bahaha
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:30:03
I doubt this with the recent rise of altcoins , I'm sure Roger is doing fine
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:24:06
It is very exciting to have some new tech to play with. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:31:53
Means the price of Bitcoin in dollars will likely continue to rise.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:31:11
Well Said
@_date: 2017-05-07 16:38:01
LTC is going to $50. Miners will signal SegWit for Bitcoin at that point.
Give it one week, and the miners will starting jumping onboard SegWit.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:39:33
SegWit gives us bigger blocks, more TPS, tx malleability fix, better script versioning, schnorr Signatures, Lightning network, CT etc. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:59:32
Pretty soon it will be reckless not to support BIP148.
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:55:35
We will end up with one Bitcoin. This whole situation is very healthy despite what many think.
It's all just growing pains.
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:32:59
A better analogy is a Taxi vs. Uber.  Taxis are less reliable (tx malleability), more expensive (SW tx are 4 times cheaper fees), and inefficient.
SegWit, Lightning, Tumblebit are newer technologies that allow new use cases that can help solve the problem.
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:38:15
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:39:09
Well, because Bitcoin has a very long difficulty adjustment schedule (2016 blocks), it's unlikely a minority chain could survive because it would be many blocks behind the longest chain and miners and exchanges would support the longer chain most likely. At that point, the minority chain would also be able to be attacked further and could have a series of splits.
However, if Core developers provide protection from this event, it's possible there could be a viable chain split.
A lot depends on how SegWit activation goes vis btc1. If it's really successful, that could create a lot of confidence in btc1.
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:28:11
I agree.  It's fucked up that the moderators just let that place turn into an abusive shithole.  
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:15:26
Nodes relay, verify, and store transactions on the blockchain. Miners audit the transaction signatures through proof of work. They are paid for their work with block rewards. This separates the hashing power from the users.  Miners are paid to do proof of work, nothing more.
Thus a UASF is entirely moral.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:00:16
He said fintech advancement. Which I agree with. Primarily due to the UASF aspect.
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:45:07
I have auto buys setup every day. I always get cheap coin :)
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:41:11
Yet not an extension block either. But pretty good way to explain
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:31:25
Yes unfortunately they are mostly hopeless scams. Unless the tokens are securitized by actual assets such as gold or equity, you are essentially buying a bunch of vague promises.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:29:33
I agree. Those worried about short term should sell. Please fucking sell your coins. I'm waiting to buy them at a cheaper price. Thanks!!
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:13:06
One of them will be worth more. :)
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:29:17
Hmm I bought at Litecoins at $10 and mined scrypt on a SegWit pool to support SegWit and Bitcoin.
I literally did this because I am a Bitcoin lover and want to see SegWit on Bitcoin.
I will support and hodl Litecoin forever now as it will help push Bitcoin development forward.
@_date: 2017-07-15 06:30:14
Not directly. Transaction volume is not trade volume. They often correlate but not necessarily causate.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:36:24
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:43:56
For sure. I'll be selling whatever coins are not Bitcoin when all is said and done.
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:34:59
I don't know. They are probably friends of Jake and Bitmain
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:36:17
When the fuck will we get binaries 
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:04:50
They will probably move to mining ETC, and this will cause a massive spike in difficulty and valuation of ETC, potentially enough to compete with ETHPOS.  
Anyone who thinks the ETH POW --&gt; POS transition will be smooth is fooling themselves.  There are so many things that could go wrong, especially when there are a variety of implementations already in the wild being used.  This is going to get REALLY ugly.
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:21:35
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:54:19
It also gives a person leverage to put downward pressure on any competing chains that come to market.
I don't think there will be a split, but if there is I want to be able to have this leverage.
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:59:45
Hehehe, doesn't work that way (I hope)
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:48:42
It looks like SegWit2x has enough support to be okay. I don't know anyone who will run BitcoinABC
@_date: 2017-05-22 00:45:24
You didn't answer the question. But anyways, I do not support premines or PoS.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:03:09
Unless of course SegWit activates prior to August 1st and such a split is avoided. Miners should start signalling by June 1st per the NY agreement. If they aren't signalling by June 15th I would say a split is nearly 100%
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:22:43
I noticed this too
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:27:00
I don't understand why they want SegWit 2x to fail. Do they really think their altcoin will be used?
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:24:47
I don't see why this is so hard to understand. Lol
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:12:30
Nodes are good. Lightning would probably encourage more nodes as well.
Ultimately, we need billions more users. Faster, cheaper, and better user experience. I believe Lightning will do that.
@_date: 2017-05-03 14:33:05
Don't forget about McAfee. He's involved somewhere in this scam too.

Ignorant self interest in this case then. How can you make a decision in your self interest when you don't know what your even deciding about?
@_date: 2017-07-15 05:54:55
You're right. Now is a good time.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:37:04
Well, now is a good time to do this.  But I would recommend cost averaging. Don't buy all at once, buy over the course of a few months and dollar cost average.

Yet no major hacking incidents and hundreds of thousands of users onboarded.... That's pretty cool
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:39:08
Get out of here with that proof of stake crap

Sure but he is partnered with companies that want malleability fixed. So his interests are their interest too.
If they really do a "UAHF" that will be a very big problem for the market.  BitcoinABC is very much a problem and will cause immediate centralization.
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:16:02
I agree 100%
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:57:52
wow. dead on!
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:34:13
Wait, so even the big blockers will now fork amongst themselves? This is hilarious. I can guarantee you f2pool will not be going along with this stupidity.
Long live Bitcoin. Fuck these altcoins

It's possible they are just upgrading their pools.

There's no questions about how to scale the network really. It's just a matter of creating the technology to do it. We should try to increase throughput in ways that don't increase the blocksize as well. I am okay with this 2mb increase for now. A multi-pronged approach to scaling is necessary anyways.
Lightning and Tumblebit remind me of Uber. Even  if they don't solve all immediate  problems they create new use cases.
There's need for both of these things.

I buy everyday as well. I don't care if people short Bitcoin, just gives me more coins 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:31:00
I'm buying either way as well.
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:47:26
Nice. This is going to be epic for Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:11:34
How about you buy Dogecoins then. You'll get a lot more Dogecoins than ETH or BTC
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:37:23
And green!

I agree that Bitcoin ABC and BU are DOA

The economics will trump politics. Once SegWit chain is active, it will be worth more. On the same note, BU could theoretically activate, in which case we could have 3 chains.
Miners should simply make the decision to do what's in their interest.
That is to maintain 1 chain.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:46:27
Move to paper wallets before, this way you could have coins on both chains in the case of a split.
I will not be doing this though, I use KeepKey hardware wallets and will just hodl because I don't think there will be a split.
@_date: 2017-05-07 19:08:35
Yes they do care and LTC is one of the few coins they do actually care about.
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:30:30
So that we could scale TPS on-chain through a soft-fork
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:00:47
Good show!
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:29:28
Hehe
