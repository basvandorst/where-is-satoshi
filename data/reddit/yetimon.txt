Yes, but with the previous two stability spikes there was an upward price movement that "broke" the stability highs.  This time it's a downward price change that's reducing stability.  Do you think this will make a difference?

We've got to stop meeting like this.
@_date: 2015-06-10 06:07:27
I hope so :)   I'm buying a small amount every week, and I have no plans to stop.

What might a Google blockchain tool look like?  A DAC search engine with an unnerving ability to match real world identities to bitcoin address?
@_date: 2014-07-01 07:11:54
Ignorant, irrelevant Luddites.

20 years from now the NSA will have their quantum computer functioning. What to do when SHA is no longer good enough?
I recall some article mentioning a proof of work that is resilient to a quantum computing attack.  Perhaps that's a way out for Bitcoin?  Changing the proof of work algorithm is no biggie, right?   Meh, what's the worst that could happen! :)

The regulators have no jurisdiction. 
They have no legitimacy.
They are ignorant.
They are irrelevant.

Already happened - see Kim Dotcom's Megacoin 
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:50:30
How many Satoshi in an Aswin?  What's that in Bits?
@_date: 2014-01-11 09:44:15
Actually, scratch that.  Kim denies any involvement in Megacoin in his interview with Max Keiser, at around 22:10 
@_date: 2014-10-25 01:04:03
Warning - very bad joke at 15:00 :)
@_date: 2014-02-10 09:46:33
Perhaps a Freudian slip?  You know - when you think one thing but say a mother?

And keep your extracted wisdom teeth in liquid nitrogen as a store of your own stem cells for later use.  Various companies offer this service, for around $600 setup and $100 per year to store it.   Also worth doing if you have breeder spawn losing their first teeth.
@_date: 2014-03-17 05:36:23
Hell yea!  In fact, lets tweet this to Stefan Molyneux and get a crypto currency three-way going on!
@_date: 2014-03-17 07:51:57
No, we're talking about bitcoin price stability, not the release schedule for Quake II. :)
@_date: 2014-03-16 05:34:58
Ugh. Disgusting breeder sympathisers.

Is there a term for DOS'ing a site with real orders?  I fear this may be a time to use such a word.

Bravo, good sir. Bravo.

There's the Winklevoxen Indoxen at  , a variety of currencies at bracenewcoin.com , and to track your own personal net worth, coincpa.com (however several of their alt currencies don't yet show up correctly - they're working on it)

Hahha! Yes, very appropriate :)

Ahem.  You mean like TheInternetIsSpeltWithACapitalI.com?

Hold on, isn't it also two weeks till Quake is released? I smell a conspiracy.

I saw one of these at Bitcoin South.  Quite beautiful.

It's nice to see the msm are still as ignorant as ever, and fully deserving of what they're going through.
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:21:53
Because they have pictures of real Bitcoins, so they must be credible!

Fuckem.  It's not their currency, they have no claim to it.

Co-incidentally, I hear ID Software will have the new version of Quake out in 2 Weeks(™) also.
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:02:02
Fuck the state. It's not their currency, they have no jurisdiction, they have no legitimacy, they have no credibility.  They are ignorant, they are impotent, and ultimately they are irrelevant.
Keep it to yourself and don't pretend that the state has any claim to your assets.

Oh, wait - wrong podcast.

Hahaha! Can't believe I didn't think of this one earlier - it's perfect! :)

Because taxation is immoral?
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:48:01
Using the recovery seed would get you your keys, but doing so reduces the security of the hardware wallet, so after you use the seed you might be best to send everything out of the hardware wallet, re-initilise it (making a new seed), and send everything back to the hardware wallet using the new addresses.
...or just wait for the manufacturer to add support for the new tokens (which might not ever happen)

Excellent......   Now to plan on how many pinball machines I can buy for each 30K coin :)

The survey does not appear in my browser, but judging by the comments it's not worth completing anyway.

They can't even spell Internet. I don't think we need to give a shit what they say.

Yes.  Read up on liquid democracy.  The freely downloadable collection of essays called No Safe Harbor is a good place to start.

Wow - so much ignorance coming from such a small mind.  And I especially love the picture of real, shiny bitcoins that he used.  If he has that many coins sitting on his desk, why does he still do "journalism" as a day job?
