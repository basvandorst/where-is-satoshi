That wouldn't be that bad in some points. As big as a political structure gets, the more inefficient it is, and democracy degradates along the way.
However, it's hard for me to see Health and Educational structures to work at a state/regional funding basis. It would only contribute to inequality between different regions

I'm confused... are you saying public education is bad?

Let's not make USA an example on education. In Portugal, after a dictatorship, literacy rates were ridiculous. The ignorance was one of the reasons the dictatorship held for so long (like any dictatorship)
Since then public school investments had a tremendous role. We were set an example by the OCDE because we are now on average with the European Union in just in a few years.
Today graduation is free and mandatory, and college has a tuition of only 1000€ a year. However, we still have one of the lowest college gratuates rate of Europe.
Public education has only brought good things in this side of the Atlantic Ocean.

I think I never thought of it that way. The first impression i got a few years ago when I heard about bitcoin was "money laundry and tax evasion paradise". But now that you talk about it, money is a piece of paper you can exchange in parallel economy as easily as bitcoin. 
*edit:* well, not that easy. Travelling under the radar with a 1M$ case may be slightly more difficult as sending a transaction in Bitcoins

State will also stop imprisoning the guilty, murder doesn't apply to my country, since it was the first to abolish the death penalty, but I have to agree with your last sentence ...

Not in red... Red makes people panic, and you don't want that.

I must say: Have you read Animal Farm? I Believe markets would again trend to monopolies and oligopolies, even after a economic breakthrough as Bitcoin. 
And I must say, I would love to believe that what you say could work, but I don't. However, I'm gonna take a look at those books.

Yet, if bitcoin becomes a major currency, tax evasion could become the rule, instead of the exception. It would be impossible to audit every business.
And we are talking about big business. And what about small business and services? Would people start to provide services, in exchange for direct transactions, without any taxes?
