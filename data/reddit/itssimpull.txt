What happens whenever it gets so hard but the reward gets so low.  If there are not enough miners to be able to crunch the data of how complex it might be wouldn't that totally slow transactions and confirmations?

I know was surprised they went this route.  I liked the sub till then I hate censorship there is a downvote for a reason.   You can't even talk about the mods changing either, a post talking about that got deleted.  I guess the are expecting a lot of kids cauese they are a kiddy coin??  I dunno knda senseless to make so many rules up.

Its not though confirmations are there for a reason.  It is up to U the person accepting the money to either wait or not for more.

Mix of 420 over the weekend and a pornstar posting something about dogecoin.  Really its any post that the mods do not deem "good" I guess, I dunno.

Btw on your gold comment, kinda an apples to orange comparison.  I say this because gold has had a history of holding value throughout humanity.  Rather it is something that is really worth something do to it being useful as a mineral or resource.  There seems to a draw for humans to gold and it has existed for centuries.  That history has to give some creditably to golds value and really gives it a natural backstop on its value.  Bitcoin has a lot bigger chance of approaching 0 then gold does.  Also it would take a lot longer to unwind gold's value to humans compared to how long it would for them to drop bitcoin.
Full disclosure,  I love bitcoin and the idea of it.  I hope it gets huge, but in general bitcoin, stocks, gold, etc are just investments for me.  Really I just want to be able to take what I have invested in and at one point trade it in for more so I can get stuff I want at any given time.  That being said I do not think following a circle jerk on any side is good and really buffet's word should be taken with some credibility

Whatever the offer counter back with a offer in bitcoin.  If you can you would want to give them an offer that they would accept, but they have to pay you in bitcoin now.  What you would want is the show giving u more time as you show them how to get bitcoins etc.  Could be postive all around.

This isn't a new thing for businesses, its part of the cost of doing a retail business.  What is nice though is after the wait and confirmations I for sure know 100% I have the cash in a hour or so.  Even with CCs it can be months before you 100% know the charge will not be challenged.

Why would they, you let it go through if it is small.  Same thing with a restaurant letting you have a tab, at anytime you can run off, pay with fake cash, or even reverse a CC charge.  Stolen goods will always happened.  Everytime you give your customers options u take on more risk, but that risk gives you access to more customers.

There def not a fraud the dogecoin community uses them a ton.  If anything they prolly have more good cred then most companies at this point in crypto.
They also have proved they have some cash as they give a ton to charities or other projects.
