We just changed the word to SPEND instead of SELL to make it clear for normal non techy new users what they can DO with their crypto.
We are the good guys in this space and building for the free peoples of the world that need help most. We appreciate any and all candid feedback!
Thank you

Bitcoin as a mid to short term invest strategy is not best in economies where inflation has reached crisis levels. At the critical point advent bitcoin becomes a way to transact like CASH when cash paper becomes worthless.
We @ paxful have been talking with the people there every day and we are going to build something to give ease to their life on a day to day basis. At the end of the day the people there are smart, willing to work and can do the same things they did before this money crisis. We give them a useable currency and Venezuela could be the worlds first Bitcoin Economy. 
If we keep focused on helping that single Venezuelan mother with two kids then we all win!

Yes! We are really proud to be on bitcoin.org and see it as a huge responsibility and an opportunity to learn.
We're really bummed out that they have chosen not to renew, but respect their wishes and their dedication to the community. We will be doing other sponsorships across the space and we want to begin a humanitarian to sponsorship Matching program where every satoshi we spend on sponsorship is matched and given to humanitarian efforts like  Even when we lose bitcoin.org we will still work towards other sponsorships so more schools will be built no matter what!
We see this as the way to help the space grow and to give back all at once. After all if bitcoin.com is seeing so much money going into it and bitcoin.org is seeing only a small fraction via donations then the neutral bitcoin educational sites will continue to lose momentum and market share. Even worse this will lead to many more confused newbies. We see this firsthand at Paxful everyday. I have had to refund so many people who sent bitcoin cash to their Paxful bitcoin wallets. Cobra realized this and his goal was to match them scale up and protect newbies. We can only do this together. We are really hoping the leaders in the community recognize the urgency of this situation as Cobra does. I am no oracle but I do spend a few hours everyday with my Co-Founder doing these bitcoin cash to bitcoin wallet refunds and some of the stories are heart breaking...
Thank you so much.

I apologize for your trouble.
That is quite a bit of money to have tied up in obvious red tape. LBC always seemed to have quality support, but three years is a bit much. I’ve met both brothers with my co-founder and they are really reasonable people. ( full disclosure: I am a Co-Founder of Paxful, also a p2p finance service which many see as a competitor to LBC )
P2P marketplaces are a step ahead of centralized exchanges with automated order books but there are still huge problems with fraud and scammers. We  work tirelessly on this and being in the worlds most challenging markets, Nigeria etc.. only makes the challenge greater (but also means our fraud defense is super tight). We ban hundreds of scammers a day and in those cases, we do hold suspend funds in escrow, but only for those who are proven to have scammed others and then these coins are later distributed to scam victims. I’m not trying to make light of your situation as you are CLEARLY LEGIT nor am I defending LBC or even Paxful, just letting you know things are rough out there in p2p land.
Let me state clearly that THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN ON PAXFUL! We have 24/7 support and even a complicated case like this wouldn’t ever take more than a day or two, especially with the proof you have provided. At the very least we can liaise with the bank in question and inform them you were receiving payment for good and services rendered on our platform.
One of our employees has had over 1 BTC held by LBC for over three years as well and they refuse to release it even after he KYC’ed and there was clearly no fraud as he was selling bitcoins. I don’t know their reasons.
Not sure how I can help here but I am willing to listen to feedback. Without vendors, there is no P2P and the reason we exist is that we listen to you guys. We just wish we did a better job of protecting you all.
Please be patient and offer feedback :slightly\_smiling\_face: We love that!
CEO of Paxful
P.S. We are really trying to help the situation in Venezuela now as it has reached the point of CRITICAL INFLATION with two zero's being added in a single day... We are actively recruiting bitcoin sellers in  and  now so if you can help and have bank account in either of those countries please do make an account on Paxful and put up an offer to sell people bitcoins. Even if you just REMIT money to Venezuela if you do it with bitcoin you can make 20% not lose 10% like with Western Union, just put up an offer to sell for a certain amount for bank transfer and give the buyer of your bitcoin the bank account of the person you are sending money too! it works like Magic and they get 20% more and you only pay less than a 1% fee to Paxful for the escrow! PLEASE HELP anyone who sees this. I will make my self available to help you directly and we have an active Venezuela chat on telegram now.
ray @ paxful dot com is my email.
1 USD = over NINE MILLION Bolivars Fuertes ( up to 16 million) ... :( lets help those people. I am doing live support here myself just like when the BP effect broke out and we will do this again With your help.

My apologies,
This is an example of how NOT to do support!
We just upgraded our support center to triple capacity and have begun hiring many new recruits. It looks like you got a newbie that didn't take the time to read thru the handbook and understand that our system looks for 3 confirmations. The right process is to escalate to a Level 3 when it seems like a system error. This almost never happens so they did not recognize it. No excuse I know. 99% of people who contact support about funds not coming through are newbies who don't know how the blockchain works, the other 1% are people who send bitcoin cash to a bitcoin address. You were neither, but a power user who seems to have encountered a genuine bug.
It is 1:49 AM in the morning in Hong Kong and I am at the office alone. I will be looking into this.
It seems the address you used was from 2015 and never used until this point. We ported over to BitGo 2 years ago and the bug most likely resides when we switched over and perhaps did not get those unused archived addresses. A very rare case, apologies, still looking into it.
Taking a bit of time to pull up these 4-year-old unused addresses in our legacy system. Please give us a few hours.

I am Ray the ceo of Paxful.
I use p2pfinance all the time to pay my bills in europe. I dont have a european bank account and my Bank of American account won’t let me wire funds to europe unless I am pshyically in the branch in NYC �� so I just have a fellow in europe pay my bills for me from his german bank account to my lawyer, tailor, wife etc...
Basically you sell bitcoins for EUR bank transfer and it works same day if early enough in the day. This is why I love �� bitcoin and peer to peer finance, I can borrow a bank account anywhere in the world. Amazing how people in Africa are using it to do intercontinental settlements! Everything will go p2p soon, that is what bitcoin was created for.

And now the 2nd school is finished!
3rd on the way. looking for the right team to help us build it.  I understand being jaded about Africa, alot of people talk about Africa but don't do anything. We are out to make real sustainable change no matter how small we start. 
We should be making more Pr and news about this to get the word out but haven't at all right now.. not even on our own homepage. We will fix that so more people can join us and help.
@_date: 2018-10-24 14:19:23
yes exactly. so many africans cannot buy things online due to major bank limits on their debit cards... those that even have bank accounts.

Pretty fake commnets here. Where are all these fake comments coming from? Some folks seem to really hate Paxful quite a bit to go thru all this. Won’t change anything, we continue to build and persue the original mission of bitcoin. Feel free to join us. We’re the good guys.

Hi, Ray CEO of Paxful here,
About to get on a plane to Rwanda to see our second school opening with some special guests ( big surprise ) but this is important so here goes.
Transparency is vital in our industry now more than ever.
Paxful has been working in the background to make sure our platform is the safest it can possibly be for our users and for customers. As Paxful and LBC are both marketplaces which provide escrow services for those who sell BTC for profit, vendors, must keep BTC in their wallets to have their offers up. This is required for a healthy marketplace so that buyers time is not wasted and ensure that they can’t be scammed as the bitcoins are proven to be there. This is the whole point of an escrow. Thus P2P platforms will always have a large volume of BTC in wallets for vendors. That being said we make certain let our users know that the Paxful wallet is for trades NOT storage and they should always have control of their own keys in storage wallets.
Here is what we have done to protect them.
1. After an internal security audit, we decided to take down our forums in early 2017 specifically because of the fear of phishing attacks. The forum was never on the main domain like LBC's forum but rather a subdomain. We still deemed this too much of a risk for our users and took the forum down. We thought LBC had also taken down their forum and were shocked to see that they, in fact, did not, especially considering how big of a red flag this proved to be in our own audits. A poor move from an otherwise secure marketplace that has been around the longest.
2. We have a fulltime security officer joining us soon who will be building a team and contracting several external security firms to run pen tests and perform audits on our platform, not just app security or network security but with a special focus on social engineering and educating our own staff as well.
3. We employed PhishFort 's services to secure our webapp in early 2018. They are proven players and always put out great research to help the ecosystem. Please do check them out to learn more about how they’ve strengthened our platform.
4. We recognize that education is driving effort number  in crypto and should also be the driving force in fintech. We are still looking for a fulltime Education Officer but we have put out many educational videos since 2017 and have begun developing a new series, specifically focused on helping first-time users in emerging markets. Look for an announcement here soon and some key partners that will join the effort. This will be focused on Africa in the beginning and then translated into Spanish and several Asian languages as our Feedback Analysis Team (our fancy name for our customer support reps ) have found users from these nations most in need of security education.  See our Paxful school videos here. [
5. I've been writing articles on user security for quite some time and as CEO and I will continue to do so. For example, I wrote the article below specifically for our African users as so many of them rely only on a password for protection. Sadly a majority of their passwords are not secure since most African website databases have been breached many times and often do not encrypt their passwords. [
6. Our Co-Founder Artur Schaback has made security his priority for 2019 and he will be putting out industry-wide guides soon. Please follow him on Twitter. [
7. We have been using BitGo for our warm wallets for over 3 years now and they are an industry proven success. We will also begin a program of full cold wallet transparency and of course, Paxful is 100% backed by reserves at all times.  [
8. We have always encouraged our users to only use wallets where they own their private keys for storage and that all web wallets are inherently not for storage purposes, including ours. [
9. 24/7 Support. No matter how secure your platform is things will happen like losing your phone with your 2FA keys, your email getting hijacked etc.. We all need support to help us through these times. Paxful has 24/7 support 365 days of the year and we always answer back in less than an hour, in less than five minutes usually. We have support reps in Asia, North America and Europe covering all the major time zones and are doubling the size of our support and doubling their training time as well. Everyone at Paxful starts out in Support but their eventual goal is to become "Feedback Analysts" by knowing the product and especially how our customers USE the product so well that they can help develop and improve the product itself. As CEO I myself partake in support every week myself and I will always do so as it is the only way to truly know your customer and have a product that they truly make a positive day to day difference in their lives. LBC support is good also but limited to 9-5 Finnish time and I don't think the bros do support themselves anymore. Life in Switzerland is good.
10. We have launched VIP support for our vendors and power users. This is a super awesome program and we are super excited about it! 24/7 personal access to your own senior support rep who will hold your hand cradle to grave and even proactively show you new ways of using Paxful, including ways of accessing better trade routes and new ventures as well. This is what my co-founder and I did in the beginning and it is the reason Paxful is here. Why should super power users who have built this marketplace and helped so many people have to wait in the same line as a newbie just asking questions? We have been listening and are going to develop this program even more. Stay Tuned as trials have already begun and we will be introducing this into our Vendor Dashboard soon!
Our mission is to further true social justice in the world through a SAFE and OPEN financial system. Making a day to day difference in the lives of working-class people around the world is how we measure our success and we take our mission and the livelihood of our users very seriously. We're not perfect but we give it our best every day and with your help, we will make P2P Finance the primarily wealth driver for the emerging world as a tool of empowerment and a way to provide wealth creation for humanity.

100,000 HODL’rs is enough and I would say with confidence that just 100 dedixated die hard entrepreneurs who truly believe in p2pfinance is enough to radically change the world.
That is enough to organicaly build the p2pfinance economy, to create platforms that cater to every country, ever niche and every desperate scenario. These threads of human liberation will come together to weave the fabric of the worlds first people powered financial network. You can see it now already in play on p2p marketplaces like Paxful, LBC, CoinCola and all the other new p2p marketplaces that are solving problems for real people along True use cases.
It is only now just beginning. 10 years after humanity was gifted with the Miracle of p2p electronic cash Bitcoin, we have a network of true beleivers 2 million strong to educate, evangalize and most importantly Hold �� in the face of FUD. That is another miracle. We have been blessed with the third miracle of the maturation of the sharing economy. Peoples are now open to getting into a strangers car for a ride to point B thanks to Uber and thus they are open to sharing the financial accounts to help people send money, pay bills and get paid.
It is inspiring to see the youth of Africa embrace p2pfinance with such zeal. We are all learning from each other and we have a window to truly change the world these next 3 years.
Sky is the limit.

This week in Africa has shown us all that the future  of  is in Africa. 
Rwanda is the future Singapore of Africa, Kenya is the tech hub and Nigeria is a powerhouse of growth. So many ambitious and brilliant young people so open to learning. All they need is access to a safe and open financial system. Project Wakanda’s first settlement has proven what is possible. 98 more to go. Kenya, Nigeria, Columbia are all possibilities. Lookong for partners to make this happen, builders, educators and organizers. 
Lets keep the momentum strong ��

I can only speak from my personal conversations with them.
1. They always made it clear that this is not a permanent thing as the community came first and things could change,
2. They the moment people started posting their concerns Cobra wanted to give us ALL the money back asap.
3. They were the ones pushing for bigger "sponsored text" and smaller graphics from the start.
They deserve no blame here. I accept the responsibility for this as I push a hard bargain. It wasn't ever about money for either of us it is about guiding the user and when it comes to UIUX and hand holding users I am a total tyrant and that is good for the user. We all saw this as an experiment in  and how we can better guide the newbie first timer gently into crypto in a way that makes sense and is sustainable. They know we are the guys that focused the most on this for the past three years, this is why this happened. This will not ROI for us and we have attracted many more hackers and DDOSS'ers from it and thus lost even more money. Don't think Cobra is running to the bank either, they just wanted to charge something fair to fund the site and give back to the community.
Buck stops here, folks. Apologies.
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:04:08
Hi, Everyone.
I'm Ray the CEO and Co Founder of Paxful.
First let me say Cobra and Will have been super transparent and DO care about the community and the money is low on their list. This deal isn't about money for us as we are not profiting from it nor will we ROI at this rate. This is about FEEDBACK from the people for the purpose of better helping the people by seeing their needs better.
That us why we were so stoked to be working with [bitcoin.org]( we knew from traffic that this wouldn't be a shower of profits and we're cool with losing money here. We are working towards something infinitely more important that monthly profits here
As the CEO, I do customer support several times a week. Yes I am actually on there talking to people and when we first began I was on the phone helping people get and use their first bitcoin. You don't really understand the challenge of crypto to change the world until you have spent 2 hours on the phone helping a non-techy single mother actually get and send her first bitcoin on her old smart phone. The act of copy and pasting that scary looking password from hell on an android phone vexxed so many people into hopelessness. Funny how those little things we geeks fly over are show stoppers for normal people. I only know this because I actually spoke to these folks everyday for six months. I hope to be speaking to the [bitcoin.org]( folks on the phone very soon as well! Will post videos. God willing. 
Our mission is simple "Help the lil guy"
Creating an open financial system  for the working people of the world and giving people a universal financial passport with this p2p marketplace that acts as a universal translator for money... more fancy ways to "help the lil guy" The lil guy needs this and we know it. Now we want to dig deeper and to every corner of the earth to see how we can really help people.
* What are their money problems day to day ? (unbanked in the USA needs btc for very specific things and valued ease and speed above all )
* What can we help them do faster, easier with less hassel ? (People in Nigeria who suffer from 90%+ inflation want to convert gift cards to cash in the bank. )
* What are their biggest fears? ( for example Indians are scared of their IRS, and don't like KYC, while Nigerians are used to being KYC'ed even to get a sim card )
* What is the biggest opportunity here? Venezuela 20,000% inflation is perhaps the path to the worlds first full loop crypto economy )
The ONLY way to know is to ACTUALLY TALK TO THE CUSTOMER, the real humans using your service. \*gasp\* I know this is scary for most businesses, especially crypto where the owners seem to like to hide behind long random strings but we at Paxful know that being 1 to 1 with your customer is the single most important thing that can be done to help people by making a better platform and to help the entire eco system mature into something that actually helps real people.
The Paxful team is about 80 people now, from just two guys 3 years ago. Me and My co-founder were homeless in NYC after a failed venture (11 for me) and we met and kept working together because we KNOW p2pFinance can really help the world. We left NYC and moved to Estonia to save costs and because of BitLicense and now we have 5 offices around the world. We're not giving up on the original mission of bitcoin no matter what and we haven't forgotten where we come from. Giving back isn't just something we do it is a central pillar of Paxful. We have a mission to build 100 schools and are on school  in Africa now.
1. \ is something we began to use crypto for lasting change with a focus on education. ZamZamWater is our first local partner in Africa and they now take    and more!  [
2. School  Nursery in Rwanda for 150+ children + 6 wells. [
3. AnthemGold has also contributed and built over 3 wells!
4. Paxful Scholarship program, first round goes to helping Female Refugees in the USA. [
5. School  is now under construction. Primary school for 300+ children and we can give them tablets and teach them about crypto! [
6. First Venezuelan food drive complete 500+ children fed! Looking for more local partners! [
7. Lots more planned, now hiring a Humanitarian Director in NYC
We're real people folks, not some shady crypto org. We show our faces and are proud of what we do. We never took a single satoshi or dime of investment from anyone. Artur and I remained **100% bootstrapped** because *we don't want the same people who ruined this financial system telling us how to build the new one*!
\ can make the world a MUCH better place. The [bitcoin.org]( guys know we get this. We're only going to do this together, working together. Please join us! normal guys working together can do EPIC things!

In their defense we were pushing for this and their was a date on the contract.
We were getting antsy because they took sooo long with the negotiations and we didn't understand why... now we know. These guys have your back and it was us pushing.
