Jesus, so that's why they charge such greasy fee's and set up shop in lower income area's.
I honestly didn't know this was the case.

No you actually need computing power, you could run ubuntu off a usb on your computer but I think a Live CD/DVD is more secure and works the same. Just don't connect it to the internet.

So what about the android open source project?
Android is free my friend, however google certification is not.

DO NOT USE THEM!
by gaining coins in many little transactions you will end up paying a massive transaction fee when you try to move or spend those coins/fractions.
Not sure exactly how it works but I think the miners fee is based on the Kb of your wallet, and many small transactions ends up increasing that number which then translates to you having to pay much more.

So you're just heavily invested in apple stock?
But what exactly about my statements is biased?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:29:50
because, it's not worth the trouble.
I've locked in profits, contributing to the crash is not in my best interest..that will just drive the price down farther. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:00:05
That they won?
If they were average guy's like zuckerberg, I'd be much more inclined to believe.
People like to believe that money doesn't buy power, though I believe it does personally. 
Either way, zuckerberg is much more savvy then they were. 
He had the power, and capitalized on the opportunity.
And that deserves respect, any way you cut it.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:32:27
while this would work, your forgetting about the REAL whales in the bitcoin world that mined or bought thousands when the price was pennies or even fractions of pennies.
Those people really control the market.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:14:23
Very true, but always remember money speaks louder then words.
I was telling people about bitcoin over 7months ago, no one was interested..
Those people are starting to become VERY interested in bitcoin.
The legacy banking system has been "proven". 
At the top you have allot more to loose then at the bottom, most people are highly invested in the current system. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:00:11
I feel that most people mining altcoins are just mining because they can turn a larger profit, with the intent on trading said coins for bitcoins or hoping they're stacks of coins are someday worth big money. So in my opinion, if you can't be profitable mining bitcoins you really shouldn't be mining. There are small differences that make most coins unique, but nothing really revolutionary. Altcoins make the public think less of cryptocurrency as a whole. For what it's worth I have many more more litecoin then bitcoin. It's the vast majority of people that need convincing, and they're still not convinced.. Just my opinion though.

You can choose to use googles apps or choose not to. 
Though your functionality might be somewhat crippled, without the play store. 
But there is Fdroid the open source market place, if you need some apps.
Base AOSP is still free, that's why "android" is the most used mobile OS. 
Many companies in china make hardware and put Android on said hardware simply because It costs them nothing. 
Plus they don't care about google certification, so usually they put the app store on also. 
For example, most if not all android mini pc's are not google certified. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:45:53
Spoken like a true believer.
But the way he words it makes it seem like like he's not one of "the Humans".
Does that mean aliens created bitcoin..to save the humans from eachother!?

Dumbass, I actually have an Imac from 2006 and it still runs good today.. but linux is FAR superior.
I use a community made version of android and choose what google apps I use, if any.
Fdroid marketplace is an open source "app store".
You can actually run android without googles suite of apps which are closed source. 
I have the newest version of android on a very old phone, and it works just fine.
Who says I use a samsung device?
Why would I drop 800$ on the newest version of their shitty iphone that does pretty much the same shit as it did in 2007.
Have you seen IOS 7, it's like a terribly ugly skin for android.
Did apple pay you to come here and defend their "good name".
You have serious issues.
@_date: 2013-12-12 08:47:57
You're forgetting that a whole new payment infrastructure needs to be put in place to use NFC, while bitcoin needs a only QR code.
Could be on a sticker or something, no expensive hardware required.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:18:03
some people didn't buy in while it was triple digits...
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:09:51
Haha have you seen the mobile OS install base as of 2013
IIRC they are less then 20%.
What do you gain from defending apple, your literally arguing with  people for NO reason. 
Grow up buddy, It isn't worth it.
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:15:59
I sure as hell would NOT pay 250k for this...MAYBE 50k
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:03:59
Always remember, you COULD loose 100% of your investment but how much could you gain?
Spend what you can afford to loose, as stated many times. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:20:34
Nice guys..really now?
I feel like they are only looking for fame, they're already rich as fuck and were before "zuckerberg stole their idea".
They're the kind of people that start at the top and complain their whole lives about nothing. 
While zuckerberg is a self made billionaire, and he deserves it.
Came from an average family and worked HIS way to the top.
Money can't (really) buy you fame, but being part of a great idea can make you famous. 
And money does't make you intelligent..
I believe the only reason they're the self proclaimed face of bitcoin is the notoriety that comes along with it.
I believe it was a TERRIBLE idea to come out and announce to the world they hold 1% of all bitcoin.
Now their a huge target, hope they pay someone allot for good security. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:05:45
So mentioning it will be your best bet still. 
Most of the money coming in now is not because they actually understand what bitcoin brings to the table but hope to make a quick buck.
I tried convincing people a year ago, they all thought I was fucking crazy. 
Not anymore... though. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:40:29
What makes you loyal to such a shitty corporation..
I used to actually like apple, but they got pretty cocky after the release of their first iphone.
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:45:29
you gotta cut your losses and move on, regret isn't worth all the money in the world. 
just stop, it'll be hard to move on but you will. 
you're in no worse shape then you were, you've lost nothing. 
the first mistake is thinking you could have been a millionaire.
Do you remember how many bitcoins you had that are now gone?
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:25:28
Something doesn't sit right about any of it with me.
having never used the site, it's just speculation on my end though.
However, if the us government wanted to smear the name of bitcoin wouldn't they use this kind of thing as a "tool".
The selling of drugs put's money in the hands of criminals, causing MANY more issues then Ross is being accused of.

bitcoin paranoid sends push notifications and has an alarm built in so you can be notified of any price fluctuation.
1%,3%,5% etc..
it also shows what the price is currently, and you can set how much it updates.
Seems like this service brings nothing new to the table?
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:08:36
Well played trollbox well played.
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:58:25
200,000$ isn't worth beating yourself up over.
It is allot of money, but money is just money. 
Very few still know about bitcoin, so as more people realize the price will go up.
Put together what you can and just buy some more bitcoin, you're still an early adopter.
so you're already doing better then most.
so realistically you're still ahead. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:16:08
I picked an android device because I wanted the freedom to USE MY DEVICE.
Money played no part in my choice, better is an opinion.
What might be better for you, may not be better for me.
And honestly I didn't feel like being grouped in with people as obtuse as yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:08:49
I honestly don't know, we need to stop using Cavirtex!
There are other options now, so maybe that will force some positive change. 
Sadly I don't know if legal action can be taken at this point because of the nature of bitcoin. 
But from my reading they should only be able to convert a portion of your holdings into canadian dollars. 
At this time that's over 1000$ CAD for a usage fee, which is fucking insane. If I remember correctly, that fee should only be 50$ CAD per month after a year.
Maybe try to contact them first and see if there willing to refund that 950$ or more if you're account was active in the past year.

Apple has stopped innovating, and they deserve to be punished for it..
Many people in china cannot afford an iphone.
Most computers in china still run windows xp, like 90%+
Wish I could set up a poll on r/bitcoin to see what mobile OS most use, IOS is for old ladies.
FWIW I use cyanogen mod/PA

If your scared about a huge drop in price, the answer is easy.
sell you initial investment only, then ride it out and see. 
Assuming of course your initial investment is a substantial amount to you personally.
Bitcoin is a gamble, but you need to let it ride to gain anything.
Always remember, you COULD loose 100% of your investment but how much could you gain?
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:39:21
Call me a bad person, but I would have removed the funds and put them in cold storage.
I've seen how the world is, good deeds hardly get rewarded..more often the not the bad deed goes unpunished. 
Why would you feel bad capitalizing on a once in a lifetime chance. 
Maybe it's fate rewarding you, maybe it's just luck..either way, a missed opportunity is a missed opportunity.
Guess you people live in a different world then I, because I've seen how ugly this world is far to many times.
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:17:12
Not bad, just more free advertising for bitcoin. 
But is that the full story, seems too short.

It's a sad world we live in. 
People are lost, I honestly don't know if it'll ever change. 
Notice how those extremely computer literate often get shunned by "mainstream" society. 
There Is a clear imbalance of power, and it's strongly in favor of those who spend much of their time on "computers".

Just don't do it, tying to convince someone with any considerable  amount invested in the legacy banking system will be VERY hard.

The real majority bitcoin holders WILL not come forward.
That would be very foolish, it would make yourself a global target.
This is why satoshi is anonymous.

Well that is the story..the MOVIE tells. 
I don't believe for a second they came up with the idea themselves, the rich hire the smart in hopes of "profit".
Intelligence is the real "wealth".
And if you're going by the movie, they planted the seed and zuckerburg turned it into what it is today IMO. 
Notice how zuckerburg isn't seeking attention, he's just enjoying his self gained fortune.
I'm not claiming I know what happened, I just question how things really went.
They have ton's of money, but they started out with ton's. 
Didn't zuckerberg attend Harvard on a scholarship?

I got a fortune cookie that warned me of this..seriously.
Well two that kind of could be related if "trying".
Last Friday to be exact.. here they are.
adjust finances-make budgets, to improve your financial standing...(well obviously.)
But get this one.
For greater returns avoid being TOO risky this week. 
So I waited to invest more, and look what happened.
Turns out fortune cookies ARE in fact insider information.
I've been sitting on 10k just waiting for the opportune time to invest. Because last time I was about to invest that much I got "talked out of it".
Had I invested I would be  very rich today, instead I invested 1k :(
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:47:06
I think it's probably because they just assume you're some kind of internet beggar, I wouldn't worry to much about it.
r/bitcoin is a confusing place, with what I assume to be many confused people. 
have an upvote, though I'm sure It won't help much.
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:33:03
I would suspect the government wouldn't want the "tracks" bitcoin provides to be available to everyone.
Think how much harder it would be for them to use dirty money.
They also can't print/make more as needed..
