And there are cheaper fees or even no fees designs on crypto processing more transactions than eth and btc combined 
What does eth security failures facts have to do with bitcoin fans?
It's up to you if you trust the guys in charge of eth more than you trust any of tons of trustless crypto, it's hard to think of any coin in top 100 less secure than eth.
Tons of crypto can do sidechains. It's just not necessary for there to be eth anymore.

bitshares and steem have been FAR ahead of eth for months in transactions per day and have about 1000x higher transaction capacity. Adding in countless problems eth has with security, no good reason to use eth.
