Then that seems like a fatal flaw in bitcoin.

I think once you get to that point he's just the leader of bitcoin and having one guy leading the economy and also owning 10% of it kinda puts us back to bitcoin not being any better than anything else.

The data on your hard disk is ALSO just chunks of data that can be interperted and reconstructed. Do you think that if the police arrest someone for kiddie porn they have to check if their disk has been defragmented or not to know if the file is contiguous to know if the porn is illegal?

What negative effects happened because it was so big? Is the answer no negative effects?

People are going to say it's a market so that fixes everything but it's a market you can only make secret bids and mysterious chinese miners get to decide if they transaction does or doesn't go through while you double spend over and over trying to pick a price they like (but only honest double spends please!) 
@_date: 2015-06-03 01:51:36
I think the fact they gave the power to some middle manager to decide in the first place pretty much indicates their overall company policy towards bitcoin.

Nodes ARE bitcoin. If you are using some website all they are doing is storing some numbers in a mysql database or something that isn't bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 03:24:14
You can do that but legally it wouldn't get any special standing any more than posting the hash any other dated public place. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:10:21
So it's unsafe? 
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:20:59
If zero conf is totally safe why even have a blockchain? Why not just do this?

Here is the wiki page he WAS able to write.

The blockchain is open, they can know what people are buying with Bitcoin too

Bitcoin was always a vanishingly tiny part of his job, it only seemed like his main thing because this was a bitcoin sub. The bitcoin stuff was minor priority backburner stuff that affected only a few businesses

Why would people want centralized Bitcoin? What benefit is that?
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:08:46
Sometimes I feel like I get a glimpse of why bitcoin brings such euphoria to people: They think satoshi invented cryptography and everything cryptography related is a bitcoin thing. Like bitcoin seems wicked more exciting if you think that!

What if they just decided to support both? Then what? 
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:19:39
And the wikilvos twins DO know how to do that? Based on what? COIN even existing just seems like a setup for the most hilarious "sorry for your loss" bitcoin has faced yet.

Nodes work for free so the general idea is that it's economically rational to exploit them as much as possible. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 12:22:16
A single satoshi is worth so little it's not meaningfully money. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 12:24:59
You figured out the issue: the economics of mining fees is all wrong and bitcoin is being paid for with inflation with no coherent model for how that would be fixed.

The BTC you own are worth less than 25% what they were worth before it happened, doesn't really matter if you held coins there or not but no, no one is going to play out your dumb murder fantasy.

At one point bitcoin was going to be this decentralized thing with no leaders. The way it's moving it probably should just autoupdate to whatever gavin says then eventually we can just have the devs run a database on a regular server and skip all the blockchain nonsense and mining and whatever. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 12:24:51
Wait, did you not know that there are other blockchains? Dogecoin has a blockchain. Like you may super hate dogecoin and wish it didn't exist but that doesn't actually make people that know it exists "uninformed". 
@_date: 2015-06-06 03:43:28
No, someone hacked 194 billion bitcoins early on and the blockchain had to have 50 blocks wiped

"Speaking on background, people close to Xapo insisted that even if Casares is found guilty, it wouldn’t hurt the company. But that may be a stretch: if LifeLock wins its case, Xapo, a financial services company, would have a CEO who was convicted of civil fraud."
Lol, they don't know bitcoin very well if they think that would harm a bitcoin company in any way.

Thread has been up for 10 hours and notice the wiki still says the exactly the same thing it said 11 hours ago.

10% variation over a few days is volitile beyond belief for a currency
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:23:22
do the math, a one hundred fold increase in transactions wouldn't pay even 1/3rd of the current miner rewards.

Listen, there is a node crisis and no one wants to talk about it, don't rock the boat and point out there is very few nodes and a bunch are duplicates. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:00:18
Clearly the solution is to wait a few days and hope the price of bitcoin moves in a way that lets you afford the thing you want. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:23:06
it won't ever be allowed to be updated. It's 4 years out of date because the community WANTS it that way 
@_date: 2015-06-03 00:59:48
Why? Have you not followed the news at all? The government has seized bitcoin just fine with literally no problems of any sort all of the times they wanted to. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:06:58
The point is to increase fees. Bitcoin won't be paid for through inflation forever.

Could not happen with 20MB blocks.

The wiki is also lying about paypal by calling 12.5 million "about 10".  and rounds down the 144 tps per second down to 115. 
Not to mention it's comparing paypal's AVERAGE day to bitcoin's MAXIMUM.

It was the cover of newsweek, it was on simpsons twice, on the daily show and the colbert report, dave letterman, in horrible bosses and a billion other places. 
At this point the "no one has heard of bitcoin!" thing is just a lie this sub tells to try and convince itself that bitcoin is just too underground  and that is why it hasn't made everyone rich yet. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 14:30:47
It's funny you think you can ask miners to do things for you

The mods of r/Bitcoin however.....
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:47:37
So you are setting up bitcoin as moon or die? So if it has another peak then the price crashes again bitcoin is just dead forever under that model? 
@_date: 2015-06-07 17:49:11
Why not just change the known incorrect information directly? 
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:00:10
"However, I have seen another proposal: that the v.new software would be programmed to raise the limit as soon as 800 of the last 1000 mined blocks had a "v.new" version stamp, indicating that 80% of the hashpower was owned by miners running v.new software."
Seems like it makes a really obvious attack vector at 799 blocks.

He figured his libertarian nonsense would exempt him from the law just like all bit coiners do.
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:51:37
Yeah probably, and they would have the mining power to attack any other fork that didn't go along with it.

Bitcoin doesn't use anything that is "encryption" so no. Public/private keys are a thing that is very often used in encryption but it doesn't mean bitcoin is encryption. Cryptography isn't always encryption.

Gavin has been trying to take over Bitcoin forever. His talking to the cia is what caused satoshi to leave followed by him giving himself the misleading title of "lead scientist" and now threatening to fork Bitcoin

Well it's good that the community is going to implement that major change with zero discussion because from what bitsenbytes understands it'll be okay. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 11:39:56
ok, cool. He still needs to be aware to not invest more than he can afford to lose and that major risks exist. Bitcoin needs informed investors not people that get scammed into it not realizing dangers
@_date: 2015-05-29 18:23:02
Miners can do that without the fork actually. That is what a 51% attack is. 
Miners make about $800,000 dollars a day so assuming miners are mining at a profit you could overpower them for any amount more than that and steal all the block rewards for a day and undo any or all of the transactions. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:41:52
The problem is that the economy is connected and users of other exchanges will lose money even if then never used okcoin, just like people that never touched Gox still are down 75%. No man is an island

He needs to be aware he could lose money. I mentioned he could gain money. But he should understand the risks not just hear to the moon hysterics
@_date: 2015-05-29 18:49:58
Argument is basically that hard forks are a big deal and that if 3 transactions per second isn't enough 20*3 isn't really any better and put bitcoin at a huge risk for little gain and a slight kick down the road of the actual problems. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 18:03:03
Why would it happen every 2 years? The cap has been 1mb for 6 years and it's not even HALF full. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:10:55
Like, it's literally happened with alt coins. It's unlikely everyone will agree to do it.  Real real unlikely, but at the same time there has been multiple times that 51% of the miners in bitcoin has been one guy or one organization. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 03:35:33
Mostly they aren't. They are mumbo jumbo buzzwords that don't even make sense conceptually.

Bitcoin has stayed in a five percent range the last few weeks but is down a third in 2015, down 1% from a week ago, down 58% since last year and down 75+% since the high two years ago so be super careful and know the risks you are getting into if you hold the coins for any amount of time. It going down might not happen and it could even go up, but the risk is real 
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:15:35
Seems like if they weren't then there is literally no reason to ever raise the block cap. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:22:02
You are right that it's unlikely, but unlikely isn't impossible. Like I said at least three times in bitcoin history one person or group has held over 51% of the mining power. And may other times it's been only 2 or 3 groups. 
Right now 4 groups are 51% of the mining. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 13:49:13
Bitcoin didn't break, no transactions failed. Didn't that prove Bitcoin is fine as is
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:15:55
Okay so one day later the government will say "oh, bitcoin aren't separate, lets just ban bitcoin".
Then every single legitimate business will stop taking it and it will be only an academic point that it technically still exists as a protocol or whatever since dell isn't going to become some weird outlaw just to take internet money. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:24:09
It's down almost 2% since I wrote the message you are replying to! 
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:56:38
It's happened with alt coins, so the answer is yes in an absolute sense. It's not literally impossible. Although it'd be so unpopular it's very unlikely to happen and have people go along with it. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:09:39
Bitcoin doesn't really use encryption except in the loosest possible meaning of the word. Did you mean to post it in this forum? 
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:48:22
All encryption is cryptography, not all cryptography is encryption. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:08:41
Bitcoin uses hashes and some cryptography but that isn't just the same thing as "encryption", every math word isn't just the same thing. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 18:21:01
That is a really weird log graph with a really arbitrary line drawn. Draw the same line on linear scale and that makes no sense.

Bitcoin is paid for by coin creation and most people don't care about it long enough for the time that is gone to matter. There is a reason it's called get rich quick
