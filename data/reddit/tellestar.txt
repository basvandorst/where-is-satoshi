i moved to coinmoni, but the BTC from these transactions are gone!.

HAPPY END!
I imported my private keys form my Jaxx wallet to a bitcoin.com wallet and voila~ all funds turned up. This was a scary experience for me. I sure learned a lot of cryptography this weekend!
I realized that all wallets use salt when creating private keys from the seed, so it would be harder than i thought to search for all private keys from my original seed if i can't get the device salt from Jaxx.
thanks for all the encouragements and ideas!
TL;DR: Jaxx sucks but funds were saved!

I tried to use on a different wallet (imported private key). 
only the first transaction showed up.
All afterwards transactions disappeared.

Yeah, now i know it's worthless!
I tried using the seed word on a different wallet, and only the first transaction ever made showed up. all subsequent transactions are gone. any way to restore them (if i have the private key) ?

NO :(   
When i look into the wallet private keys i can't see these public key "13g4U4a9nZUg89pHYyGTGFuLCXaYALk2C3" anymore !! 
This means they are not on the wallet anymore!! i see only other public keys with corresponding private keys.
I guess this is game over

Each time an address was generated by JAXX. 
I saw the funds on the app a few days! But when i did reset cache they disappeared...Maybe there's still a way to recover it from the device file system ?
