So you're ignorant on the subject as you've just made clear.
If you want to move up the food chain as a teacher, you have to get at least a masters.  Just because you get the degree doesn't mean you automatically get a job however, so you may have to continue teaching with a masters until something better becomes available.  
Also, I understand basic logic.  If you knew how to form a sentence without making overly broad generalizations, I wouldn't have bothered to reply.


Holy shit though.  Dunning Kruger effect much?

If you want to be an administrator, they don't hire people without a masters for the most part, unless you have 15+ years of experience and even then they'll want you to get your masters.  That might not be true of everywhere, but if you work in a good district, it is.
The pay difference is terrible for BAs vs MAs, you are 100% correct on that.
Also, all of the PhD teachers I knew were science or math teachers.  I think most of them didn't want to teach college but had to work, although I can't back that up.  The rest were superintendents, but that job is largely political.

Yup, every one of them can't understand anything beyond 8th grade.  Not a one of them can possibly be doing the work because they enjoy it, and they certainly never go on to get masters or doctorates or hold multiple degrees.  
Are all non-STEM grads that stupid, or just teachers?
