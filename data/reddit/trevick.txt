If you don't care about anonymity, use coinbase. On coinbase you can get a bitcoin right now for $800 (plus a 1% markup, so about $8, or $808 total).  
On localbitcoins, I see 1 BTC everywhere from $830 to $1700 or more.  And on top of that markup, you either have to go to a bank and do a cash deposit or meet someone who is totally not going to rob you, he swears, and that takes time, which is also money.
Plus, coinbase is based in San Francisco, so if they screw up, you can always fly there and camp outside 1 Bluxome Street.
Also, after you have an established relationship with coinbase, you can buy BTC instantly.  Just a few mouse clicks, and I'm already transferring BTC to wherever I want it to be.  The ACH transfer happens a few days later.
If you REALLY need the transaction to be anonymous, coinbase is obviously not the right choice, but if you don't care, then localbitcoins is a waste of time and money.

The bitcoin economy inflates by a fixed amount per day through mining.  There is an infinite amount of US Dollars you can earn by selling equipment to miners.

Some of you guys are too cynical.  
The point isn't to educate Amazon about bitcoin, but to let them know there is a sizeable portion of their customer base interested in having them support it.  
Voting with your feet (and boycotting Amazon or shopping at Overstock) is also an option, but it's silly to pick as your first choice, since the company won't know why you left.  So these petitions are useful because they do let the company know (and, yes, large companies notice these).
Paypal took off partly because they got people to petition eBay sellers to take it.

I had that problem. Eventually, I started getting the SMS messages, but it took a while.  In the meantime, I switched to Google Authenticator.

It gives you the choice.  You can book a standard rate that will get you pointshound.com rewards but still lets you get hotel points (and have the night/stay count toward elite status) OR a lower, discounted rate that doubles up the pointshound reward, but you get no hotel points and it doesn't count toward elite status, etc.  
Unfortunately, I have to book my hotel through my corporate travel site, or else I would be banking some major BTC this year.

Especially considering how badly hotel loyalty points and airline frequent flyer miles have been devalued the last few years...

I tried to be one of those smart people but I sold too late.  I wasn't sure it was really going to crash hard at first, but then I got stopped out of a few long positions, and it kept going down, so I sold, figuring I'd buy back in at the bottom, and I set a few buy orders and went to sleep.  The next morning it was already back where I sold and missed my buy orders by a smidgen.  So I ended up buying back in a little bit higher than it was when I sold.  Oh well...

It's a CFD (contract for difference) which basically means you are gambling on the price movement, but you don't own the underlying instrument (in this case, bitcoins).

I don't think Bitcoin has a chance of "killing" Paypal.
Paypal would likely just use Bitcoin.   They are basically just a wallet like coinbase. They could easily add the other features of coinbase, and they have better name recognition with merchants.  
The Paypal CEO has already mentioned he is a fan of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:59:03
Because they can make more money selling it.

I think the idea behind the bitcoin-enabled browser is not to enable payments, which you can do already.  It is to enable transparent microtransactions.  
The feature they mention that existed early on but never used is the HTTP 402 status code.  And, they mention wanting to avoid having us fill out credit card information.  Similarly, I think we need (more accurately: would greatly benefit from) not having to scan QR codes and fill out bitcoin payment forms.
You should be able to go to a website (say, wnj.com).  If the site requires payment, it could send back a 402 Payment Required status code, and based on some standard rules configured in the browser, the browser would automatically send payment for each page viewed or whatever metric everyone agrees on.  And, in return, because we are now actually directly paying content providers, one would hope they would stop showing ads.  But at no point, should I have to stop and scan a QR code or fill out a form, or even click a button for trusted sites, as long as the browser still has cash inside its wallet.
Of course, the devil is in the details, and working out what the "standard rules" that don't require user intervention, what is negotiable, and when to pop up a "this site wants 0.00001 BTC per page impression, is that ok? yes | no | always" box would need to be worked out.  Also, we'd have to work out a decent way to scale out Bitcoin (+ additional layers?) to large volumes with subpenny transactions.
@_date: 2015-10-26 20:04:44
The content providers have to make money, and right now that's through ads. Consumers don't want ads, so they download ad blockers. Content providers have an incentive to change how they monetize their sites because customers are bypassing their current means for monetization.  
Charging the consumer directly a per-use fee makes the most sense, but it isn't practical with current payment systems.  (Then again, it's not that practical with bitcoin either, but a solution in that -- or a related -- space is more likely.)

The answer is no, but only because Paypal will just use Bitcoin behind the scenes.  
Bitcoin is great for certain kinds of transactions, particularly where addressability and fraud aren't a concern (sending money to family, for instance).
But on eBay, or other sites, I personally would still rather pay for fraud protection like Paypal offers.  And I appreciate the simplified merchant checkout process they offer on shopping sites (simply login to my account to pay without having to dig out my bank account or credit card).  That would still be useful even if behind the scenes Paypal debited a Bitcoin wallet instead my bank account/credit card.  Granted, coinbase integrates similarly, so perhaps coinbase could replace Paypal, but Paypal kind of has an advantage in that it is more ubiquitous.  And given that their CEO is a Bitcoin fan, it's very unlikely that they will allow themselves to be "replaced" by this technology.

Luckily for me, I had lost half of my BTC from gambling while the price was at its peak. So now I can relax and think of it this way: my losses are going down as we speak!

Coinbase has reliably provided me with the bitcoins I bought.  
But they aren't without their share of problems.  
I had cancelled a transaction at one point, and a couple days later they sent me an email saying "after reviewing this cancelled transaction, we decided it should have gone through."  Apparently, they confused this transaction that *I* cancelled with one that their system flagged and cancelled.  So I ended up buying more coins than I intended.  I didn't bother to complain about it though.  
I *did* get every bitcoin that I paid for, and it took no longer than a standard ACH transfer takes, so I have no complaints there.

200 test cases aren't really a whole lot...
@_date: 2013-07-31 00:04:01
But if you send the money to people who consider bitcoin to be imaginary, they won't do anything with it, and the coins will be lost forever and no one will be able to spend them ever again. 
You would be better off throwing it away to a random address.  Like this one: 199pkt3NQWPY6hTuw1xSvFMRq6tnEkyys3.  Then you can use the power of your imagination, just pretend it was owned by the CAH people, and that it was them (and not someone else, such as me) spending the coins, and that they learned the error of their ways.  All without eliminating the coins from the economy forevers.

It's backed by the network effect.  If a good number of people accept seashells, pretty beads, matches, or colored pieces of paper in exchange for goods and services, it's money.  If they don't, it's not.  It's backed by everyone who is willing to accept it.

Paypal's value is in whatever they want it to be in.  I fully expect to see them add a Bitcoin wallet feature to my Paypal Account in the coming year or two.  Everything coinbase does, Paypal will probably end up doing.
