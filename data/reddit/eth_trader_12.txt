How am I stupid when I was right? Announcement came earlier. If someone sold right then, they’d be fine.

1000x more adoption than bitcoin.

He said no lmao.

Read my reply to the comment you just responded to.
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:23:28
He deleted the comments from both accounts for a reason. You can verify this. Stop playing dumb.

Most people don’t know he’s a London resident. They think he lived in Australia at the time of btc’s creation.
Nice try though.

Everything is verified. You don’t want the truth. This screenshot is real.

I knew that would be your only response. One of the BTC devs just got exposed starting a smearing campaign and instead of acknowledging the facts, you come up with a meme response.
@_date: 2019-04-16 01:12:33
Why would he be inactive from 3-9 PM? Besides, he’s Australian anyways.

The person who pretty much orchestrated all of the evidence against Craig (much of which doesn’t show much, but we can agree to disagree on that if you want) was u/contrarian__. In fact, every time you see someone who says that “Craig fabricated X” or “Craig fabricated Y”, almost all of that supposed evidence came from this account.
Nulls (the account in the screenshot) is Greg Maxwell, who has a very public and fierce rivalry with Craig Wright. He has had multiple disputes. Contrarian is him given that he posted the same comment on both accounts.
After realizing his fuck up, he deleted the comment. This entire campaign against Craig started from Greg and is a campaign based on weak evidence that the courts will show soon. Again, EVEN if you disagree with me and still think Craig is a fraud, you have to atleast acknowledge how shady this is.

He withdrew it because of finding out that he can’t verify the date. There is no evidence that he generated this email. If you have any, enlighten me.

Should be white since whites have the smallest penises:

We’ll see who is stupid and who’s smart on that date then :)
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:44:11
You could say the same for the opposite.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:47:26
Just my username lol. I buy and sell everything.
@_date: 2018-07-31 03:54:17
Yea but when did you buy? 
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:27:28
Lol. Sure they don’t. If they did, most of this sub wouldn’t be getting ecstatic over fiat value increase.
The truth of the matter is that 95% of the people here care about one thing the most: increasing their fiat value. You’d be extremely delusional if you think otherwise in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:43:46
There’s no difference because people are one and the same. It doesn’t matter what you create: greed and the fact that most people are poor will motivate everyone

Most people are on hopium
