Actually, seriously, not a bad idea.

"Oh, cool! What apps have you made?"
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:11:39
Bitinstant will send bitcoins directly to any specified bitcoin address, so yes. For me it took less than an hour.

...How much btc do you own?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:15:46
Ha, cool, OK. I'll keep track of picks for a couple weeks or so, as well as the inverse, and see which comes out on top. Cool, thanks man.

I did the same and missed out of all of 120-190. Forget your transfer, send it back when it gets there. I ended up using bitinstant; it was insanely easy and super fast.

It's probably better to say something more obscure. iPhone apps are just too close to people's understanding
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:53:56
It's definitely been a learning experience.
@_date: 2013-05-08 18:41:15
Gonna need a name on the host.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:25:26
You're pretty.
@_date: 2013-03-20 03:29:03
yeah i took a bit too high of a [dose](

Not here. Everyone's suddenly getting selective memory about how things were in this subreddit just a few days ago.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:27:11
Won't using an open wiki just be a bit more of an opportunity for scammers?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:19:15
Question, everyone's worried about timing the top, but how do you time the bottom?
@_date: 2013-03-20 03:30:10
That is enormous, thanks
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:14:15
[Wasn't it?](

Jesus Christ is greed the correct word. People making 200%, 300%, 500% ROI holding because they want even more. I was one of them. This is a great learning experience, anyway. I guess the right mindset to have is that 1) Yes, if growth is parabolic, it *is*, a bubble (or will at least suffer a harsh correction) and 2) You will never time the top exactly. Try to get out while it's good, or you will fuck yourself over.

Do you have any good resources on the recent events of our banking system? 
@_date: 2013-05-10 16:04:23
If you could tip people on youtube, I would do it all the time. Youtube takes a small (ha) cut of that tip, everyone wins
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:03:57
Yeah sure why not
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:37:34
I'm going to be honest, I don't think I've ever experienced greed like I did watching the price of bitcoin rise over the past few days. I think I'm going to get lobotomized.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:54:48
Yes, because America is know for its education. lol what are you trying to do here mate
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:20:14
"sell low doodz"
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:08:35
Lol, I'm American. I was just making fun of you.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:12:17
Rule 1: Do you mean the fundamentals of the investment/commodity/whatever being sold, or of economics itself, or both?
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:36:34
Law does not equal logic, nor morality.
@_date: 2013-05-10 16:08:33
Do you believe in bitcoin as a currency? How will it survive if the average person will inevitably lose them?
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:46:27
Human nature.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:23:45
Do you happen to own an underwater hamburger joint?
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:40:01
I guess. That problem isn't necessarily with bitcoin, just the fact that Mt Gox is such a huge exchange, percentage-wise. That can't continue.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:23:13
Why do people always sell 100% of their coins? Why not sell a small part so you can cement your gains and still experience growth?
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:09:16
Yeah, not everyone's job is like this. At all.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:58:17
I'm new to this. What about, "Have a plan and stick to it, no matter what"? I'm coming to see that emotion is the death of good investing.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:54:53
Haha, that seems like a dumb question now. Greed's a bit blinding, you know?
