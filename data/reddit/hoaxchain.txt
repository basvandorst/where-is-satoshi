You are clearly a liar Erik.  The letter you signed in March is clear.  Now you are going back on your word.  It is clear for everyone to see.
That attempt to weasel out is pathetic.  Everyone knows what it originally meant.
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:15:54
Erik, you made a clear commitment to only support safe hardforks, with strong replay protection, in writing.  You signed a statement saying that you "insist that any other consensus breaking implementation build in strong two-way replay protection".
Now you are promoting a dangerous hardfork without this safety feature.  Why are you going back on your word?  Please insist that 2x includes this vital safety feature and then support 2x.
Please respect these crucial agreements, designed to make upgrades safe.  It is a disgrace that you agreed to make hardforks safe and then promote a dangerous one.  Going back on your word.
How can we trust you again?
I am very sorry to say this, but you are a liar, unless you modify your position and demand safety features, you already committed to.
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:07:29
It is not about disagreement 
You went back on your word
You went back on a commitment to the Bitcoin community and your customers 
That is dishonest

@_date: 2017-09-14 02:07:01
Please stop with this false nonsense.  Dr Wright's mother is a paid AXA/Blockstream shill.  Just like those toxic Australian judges:

So you are not running 2x then?
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:24:26


How can that be true?  Erik signed a statement, committing to key safety features for any hardfork. Then he starts promoting a hardfork, which does not include the safety feature he promised.
Why would he do that if he is "just trying to make Bitcoin work"?  
The community needs to wake up.  We must stop deluding ourselves into thinking Bitcoin has no enemies. This dishonest behavior is clearly hostile.


As a business owner, who made a clear commitment to support good and safe practices.  Erik owes it to his customers to follow those safe practices.

@_date: 2017-09-18 01:05:36


What does "we insist that" mean then?  Erik is actively promoting 2x coin, which doesn't have strong 2 way replay protection.  That is a clear breach of this statement
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:23:02
Please stop with this false nonsense and lies.  For example your unfair quote from Dr Satoshi's **mother**! Dr Wright's mother is a paid AXA/Blockstream shill. Just like those toxic Australian judges:


It's an odd coincidence you left out the quote from the judge!  Perhaps because everyone knows he is a Blockstream shill.

Not true.  Dr Satoshi Wright has done a lot of technical research.
See here for example:
We have created this blog to focus on our advanced research, away from all the noise.
There is original research into the legality of SegWit, why Bitcoin has double hashing and even research into whether "Scronty" masturbates or not

Fixed thanks


Firstly it is not true that our advanced supercomputer is imaginary.  The computer can be seen here: 
hoaxChain claimed a  [$54m tax rebate] ( from the Australian authorities for that computer, which we then invested in top blockchain research to create opportunities in Australia that have not been imagined before.
As our CEO said, some people are creating more "hearsay and bullshit stories" about the computer, such as saying its "imaginary", claiming we have defrauded the Australian tax authorities.  
Or SGI themselves who said:


This allegation is totally false, as Dr Wright himself said:


Secondly, comments about our advanced supercomputer are explained in our May 2015 press release available here:
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:35:50


This is a fantastic point.  Its not true of course, being on the cutting edge by using those hash functions in that order is nonsense.  I do not remember such an 8 month debate.  Do you have any citations for this debate?
Of course its not a point made by the [appeal to authority paper] (
The paper says that Mr Maxwell was simply wrong:




Although was clearly [correct] (
The paper states that:


The paper claims that one could merely choose those ciphers.  It says nothing of a debate.
As our engineers at hoaxChain went on to [calculate] ( that the probability of the ciphers matching is about 1 in 13,692.  This is an amazing coincidence.
is therefore a liar or a moron.  Case closed.
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:50:28


This is a good question.  This is a highly complex and technical subject, which is difficult to discuss.  However there was a detailed cutting-edge discussion on an advanced science forum about this yesterday:


awemany [9:06 AM]


Dr Wright then quotes some of his upcoming paper.  And the discussion continues as follows.
awemany [9:56 AM]




 
csw [10:38 AM]


 


 


I appreciate this is complex stuff and hard to follow for people who are not an "overqualified academic", however the above shows that double sha256 makes a collision much less likely than a single hash, because the 2nd hash reduces the number of inputs, so its a much smaller number than infinity.
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:01:53


No.  The time it takes to find a block is 10 minutes, but if you are already 5 minutes into the time, the expected time is now 5 minutes left to go.  Since 10 minus 5 is 5.
Think of flipping a coin, if you get 5 heads in a row, the next flip is almost certain to be tails.  The probability of getting 6 heads in a row is 1 in 64, so there is a 63 in 64 chance of getting a tails next

The website is not trying to make **the** point, it is trying to make **a** point.  It is a point about Craig Wright’s credibility:
* The specific point of the website is to show that some people (allege Craig Wright’s key on the Tulip Trust was fraudulently backdated.   Craig Wright’s response is an alternative explanation, which is that a freak 1 in 13,692 coincidence occurred in 2008 when Dr Wright strangely decided to manually change the ciphers.
There are several other points one could make about Dr Wrights credibility.  For example:
* An Australian Appeals court judge stating the following about Mr Wright in a 2004 ruling:


* As you mentioned, Mr Wright’s Tulip trust document containing fingerprints of keys claiming to be Satoshi’s, which are not the keys known to actually be Satoshi’s
* Mr Wright claiming he has a PhD from Charles Stuart University, when the University told [Forbes]( that "Mr Wright has not been awarded a PhD from CSU"
* Mr Wright stating Replace by Fee is the [“biggest piece of shit ever created”](  when Satoshi originally [created]( replaceable transactions
* Mr Wright announcing that he would prove he was Satoshi with a signed message, and then in 2016 releasing a convoluted blog post which included a confusing signature from Satoshi that was copied from the blockchain, presented in a misleading fashion
Now you can choose to believe what you want.  The fact is that Dr Wright is either Satoshi or he isn’t, that is just two possibilities, so there is at least a 50% chance Mr Wright is Satoshi.  At [hoaxChain]( we believe...

Stop lying. 


Mr Maxwell, read our "Appeal to authority: A failure of trust" blog post from May 2017.  You have clearly lied.  We will now make sure you pay for this.  We now have a serious lawyer, Jimmy Nguyen, working for us, and we are coming after you!

Great Question.  Actually, at hoaxChain we have loads of money.  As our website explains, we recently raised a lot of money from a secretive network of shell companies in Malta, Mauritius, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Hong Kong &amp; Bermuda:


But even prior to that, we still had loads of money, we raised $54 million from the Australian government in tax rebate scam. As our chief scientist and CEO, Dr Wright, said in 2015:


However, despite all this money, we are now doing an ICO, to fund even more advanced research:
You can send Bitcoin to: 
     1HmNNSrHBQjxeX6U2kTFUnSEjGLAKGHqhC 
Or Ethereum to:
     0x567dc096d5F91a6c796594984ff6C2aB2e98ec6a
Currently, we have received c$12 in Bitcoin and $1 in Ethereum.  However the ICO runs until December and we are very confident of raising well in excess of $40 million.


If you participate in the ICO, you will receive HXC tokens in the wallet you set up and can transfer them from there. You can then sell them in the markets.  Once our HXZ IoT smart platform is implemented, you can choose to lock your HXC tokens in the HXZ smart contract. By locking your tokens down for a fixed period of time as HXZ, you will receive HXX as interest payments, at a rate determined by the market.

* The first fucking nine keys
* The fucking genesis bloody block
* The fucking papers
* The fucking code
* 1,100,111 Bitcoin inside the [Tulip Trust](
As Dr Wright explained: 


What will the haters do when Mr Wright released all of this proof?
After-all, [what if the haters are all wrong?](

Is this fact hard enough for you:

For example our analysis of the backdated PGP key...  Everything is 100% sourced
Here is the ciphers being added:
A year after Dr Wrights key was dated.  I dont understand how you can claim that is "opinion, hearsay or pseudoscience"
It is a hard fact...

Fantastic video!!  Exactly,  nobody knows for sure Dr* Wright is not Satoshi, therefore anyone claiming Dr Wright is not Satoshi is a moron.
For example claiming Dr Wright's PGP key on the [Tulip Trust]( document was [backdated](  Clearly is a being a moron.  As this [paper]( explained, in an amazing coincidence Dr Wright happened to manually choose the ciphers which were [specified]( a year after Dr Wrights signature is dated, even though the specification said the choice of ciphers "might be viewed as a bit strange".  There was only a 1 in [13,692]( chance of these ciphers being picked.  Therefore and anyone else saying Dr Wright is not Satoshi is a stupid hater.
Note:  * Although Dr Wright has a PhD, according to Forbes ["Mr Wright has not been awarded a PhD from CSU"](
