I can buy from an Indian exchange since I am located here. But there is a possibility that I can buy from a US exchange. 
But I am trying to understand how this would work. I want to make sure that I am not missing something. 
Will the prices in one exchange or location catch up with another location ? is this a lag in pricing or are the price movements completely independent and non correlated ?

How do I find out how much the fees are? I see posts here that mention they made a purchase and found out the fees. I mean, can't you find out this before hand?

I bought it from a company. They have the keys. So, what I need to is withdraw my bitcoin into a wallet ? Is there anything I need to do with the keys like ask them to delete it or something ?
Is someone actually downvoting? I am not able to see it. Anyways, thanks for your answer.

If everyone is willing to pay so much to buy, then that should just increase the price of bitcoin since there is higher demand. How does that increase the fees? That is charged by the exchange right ? so, can't another exchange just charge a lower fee? why does fees for bitcoin as a whole go up?
