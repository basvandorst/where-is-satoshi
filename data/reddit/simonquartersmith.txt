**EGO:** Satoshi Nakamoto sees her/himself as a HUMANITARIAN or simply someone who influences human culture, having a role for social change or cultural innovation, nurturing, empathetic, realizing dreams, perhaps to personal neglect, unable to change, with obsessive beliefs. 
This is founded on self-appreciated motivations of affiliation and realism. 
**PERSONA:** Satoshi Nakamoto is felt to be a CO-OPERATOR or PARTNER: reasoning, seeing both sides of an argument, and people-oriented, either forming partnerships, counseling or entertaining others, or prone to be shy, self-conscious, and avoiding groups and close relationships.
This is founded on apparent concerns about willfulness. 
**SELF:** Satoshi Nakamoto is fundamentally a WILLFUL thinker, innovative and pioneering, independent and individualistic, inspiring trust with clear decisiveness, but prone to be arrogant and self-absorbed.
This personality is driven by concerns about personal growth and emotionality.

Think of a Bitcoin as an ounce of gold.  Once you have the gold, if the price of gold goes up or down, that's how much it's worth.  Until you actually get the gold, though, you have regular dollars (USD).  Whether a past price is honored during a slow transaction depends on who you're buying the gold from.
In the article I posted above on 247btc.com, you are bringing cash to a local retailer who sends that money (USD) to your Mt. Gox account.  Until you actually purchase the Bitcoins on Mt. Gox (see the screenshots in the article), you have USD.  It just shows up in your Mt. Gox accounts as dollars, like an online bank.  But once you purchase the BTC on the exchange (Mt. Gox), you no longer have USD, and you have BTC.
I hope this helps clarify.

The article draws an analogy between:
 * Bitcoin and Railroads
 * Bitcoin exchanges and Railroad ticket booths
What other analogies are useful in understanding the Bitcoin landscape?

BoA &amp; Bitfloor are good.  There are lots of other options too.
Here is a very easy to follow overview for US residents buying up to $1000 per day.  It walks you through how to set up money orders, where to bring cash (CVS, Walmart, etc.), and how to turn that into Bitcoins:

Here's a great tutorial that walks you through exactly how to do every step of this, using BitInstant so you can bring cash to CVS (etc.) to do a MoneyGram transfer to Mt. Gox to buy your Bitcoins.

Analysis compares per-5-minute average trade volume (BTC) in this crash vs. previous crashes to come to the conclusion that price will continue to increase now that this "fake" crash is over.

I agree with your sentiment.  Bitcoin itself is solid even if the exchanges are problematic.  We shouldn't forget that even amid all this turmoil.
This article uses an interesting historical analogue to explore the difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Exchanges and reinforces the importance of keeping them conceptually distinct:
* 
BUT anywhere there is the opportunity to buy low and sell high, people will find it and push the limits.  If buying &amp; selling of BTC exists, it will be turned into a "game" like almost everything else in financial marketplace.

Well this is a false dichotomy.  The choices are not "*force exchanges to have a minimum trade size*" vs. "*solve this cryptographically/mathematically*".  There are already multiple exchanges, and people are free to use whichever they want.  All it takes is for *one* to do it better: putting a minimum size on trades, flat trading fees, rate throttling...
Many of us (like OP) would rather see an exchange where bots can do whatever they want, trading quickly to provide liquidity, and that's probably the future.  But *until* the exchange coding and infrastructure is capable of handling it (and none of them are even close right now), the only people being naive are the ones pretending we're in an ideal world where we can ignore the simple obvious solutions in front of us and keep trading with hour+ lag and downtime.
