Rather than centralize further, what we need is some sort of platform to efficiently trade between exchanges; taking advantage of price gaps between each to further stabilize the price of BTC. With today's tumble, my BTC transfers have been tied up because of the widespread DDOS on MT. Gox.
There are much better (albeit very new) exchanges coming onto the scene ([CampBX]( for instance, btw enjoy 10% off for life with that link)that have more advanced features.  I think one thing we've learned from today's crash is that we cannot rely on MT.Gox alone; rather a collection of exchanges each fulfilling a niche (BTC-E, albeit shady, is the only one on the scene with multiple crypto trading).

Interestingly enough, the 6 hour transfer time from blockchain to Gox led to me missing the sell opportunity and I figured I should hang on. Apparently we're in for a few more of these up/down cycles.

I've said it elsewhere, and i'll say it here: this will keep happening if we put all our coins in one basket (i.e MT.Gox). The BTC market's standing with most of its weight on one leg (gox); what we need is to spread our weight out more to other exchanges. Reason is that a DDOS event shaking the tree that has ~80% of BTC transactions effectively shakes the whole forest. 
[LibertyBit]( for instance is floating in and around $170 CDN which is not bad all things considered. New exchanges such as [CampBX]( (full disclosure: sign up with that link and receive 10% off for life) has advanced features such as shorts-elling and selling on margin built into its framework. BTC-E (despite its shady-ness allows exchange with other crypto-currencies).

A 20th century online exchange operating amongst entities that use 21st century tactics. Didn't you notice the hoard of $0.02 transactions generating the immense lag leading to fall?

Conversely, I'm starting to see a bunch of 0.05 btc transactions on gox, it reeks of hft bots trying to drive down the price.

Interesting, similar to how high-frequency trades rapidly ping the market to get a feel for how high/low the price can go.

I remember contemplating yesterday the need for some sort of 'meta exchange but without the centralization. Ideally something that works akin to bittorrent in that it gets faster as more people trade; while providing an easy way to short-sell currencies/assets/cryptos. One issue I found was that I can't feasibly take advantage of price gaps between exchanges due to the fact that once I sell BTC for USD, I need to buy more BTC at that exchange's rate. A decentralized bitcoin/litecoin/fiat exchange would alleviate that and allow for short selling to enable some protection against bubbles.

Interesting, how would you propose the implementation of short-selling or margin-buying?

Could it be that bots are trading between multiple addresses owned by the same entity to intentionally drive the price up/down?

PHP Web Development, no one will question you.

[CampBX]( is shaping up to be an interesting contender to MT.Gox, enjoy the 10% lifetime discount!

If you think about it, bitcoinity's DDOS must've been due to an excess number of people in panic F5'ing the hell out of the site for new info (I tried it and it was the only way it worked at times).
