Was this ever recovered?

No it’s different. Data is stored redundantly on multiple servers on the main chain.
In LN your txs are stored by you on your own server.

Lightning is an entirely new network with its own coin that is traded between people and converted back to BTC once channel closes.
IOUs are real on LN because no txs that occur on LN are secured or recoverable in the event of data loss.

I don’t think you understand the lighting network. I’m here to question the future of Bitcoin rather than just following.
Where is the signed tx stored after I pay you?

Cards aren’t USD they are essentially coins. They each run on their own networks. A business who doesn’t accept WEX is choosing not to accept WEXCoin for whatever reason.

Sending $20 through the mail is not $20 on PayPal.
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:50:03
No it doesn’t. A signed TX doesn’t change your BTC balance on BTC network. Theoretically that signed tx becomes an attack surface which I am incentivized to destroy.

Venmo and PayPal are networks that convert your USD into another form. It’s up to the recipient to return it back to USD.

USD is accepted at 99.99% of businesses. What the acceptance rate of PayPal bucks? Only PayPal businesses that are on the PayPal network accept PayPal bucks. I can’t use my PayPal balance to buy Starbucks. I need to redeem PayPal bucks with PayPal for USD.
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:36:26
Yes it is Bitcoin. I control the keys, and it’s value is cryptographically secure.
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:29:47
It is pegged. The Bitcoin network will not recognize your LN balance until you close channels.
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:43:02
Not true. Paying you with LN is done by sending you a signed tx that is redeemable for BTC when verified on chain. Until then I still own that BTC according to the network.
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:23:02
You need another network to validate this shift in balances.
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:17:41
So creating a BTC pegged coin 1:1 (Tether of BTC) with faster tx time and no fees isn’t the same thing as LN?
@_date: 2018-04-09 03:33:23
You need to understand that Venmo and PayPal credit is not USD. These two systems have limitations on redemption and acceptance unlike USD.
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:27:39
Let’s say BTC is too slow or slow expensive to send you $10 USD. I send you $10 worth of LTC because it’s faster and cheaper to send. You then exchange LTC for BTC. What’s the difference?  Both require two networks to facilitate the transfer of $10.

Deposits are liabilities because banks convert your USD to bankCoin, which is redeemable for USD in the future. If a bank had to redeem every bankCoin on their database at the same time they would fail because they literally don’t have all the USD to make redemptions possible.
