Yeah I get all of that - the potential that it promises is exactly what excites me about it as well. I guess the angle I’m coming from is even people like yourself who are excited about its potential are treating it like a stock and as a part of your investment portfolio. That mentality (especially with the HODL meme) inherently means it is going to be less fluid. People are going to be holding onto it as a commodity/investment vehicle.
The true magic and potential of bitcoin surely doesn’t get fully realized until it’s fluidly exchanged as a currency with a stable exchange rate, right?
Like to me, it kind of feels like people talking about how groundbreaking this new fancy sports car is and how it does things never before seen in a car and gives the best driving experience ever....but then when someone suggests driving it, the answer is “oh no we couldn’t do that, it’s far too valuable. Best just sit on it here in the garage.”

When you say it will be huge - do you mean as an investment vehicle or as a currency?
I personally own 0 crypto but have always been in love with the idea behind it. But it seems to me that idea - the deregulated, non-government sanctioned currency has given way to the HODLers. People will jokingly talk about how they spent multiple bitcoins to buy a pizza back in 2012 and now feel awful about it. But like...wasn’t that the point? To have a new form of currency that filled a role that others didn’t?
Right now it just feels like (to me anyway) an extremely volatile stock.
