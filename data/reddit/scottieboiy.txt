Happy Wife until financial stress hits and it was all a waste because you get a divorce and are left with wedding debt that yall should have been together long enough to save up before making a decision like that. Not to mention it’s mostly for women just to flex on how much money you’re able to “afford”.

I didn’t know people actually take out loans for a wedding. I could never ��

Banned the school shooter game also. Evil fucks...  But seriously. This is is only the beginning.

What does that have to do with Bitcoin...¿....?
@_date: 2018-10-12 23:20:55
Your answer is nope? �� It is tech to help out with Bitcoin’s self made deficiencies. If exchanges don’t use it they’re at a disadvantage. It’s not really voluntary, because of monetary constraints.

Voluntary meaning use this new product or fuck yourself trying to use the inefficient coin

He’d pay a percentage on the dollar value of the payment, then a percentage on only the gains when he decides to sell it. Yes it is worth it.

You mean like Peer to Peer Digital Cash with low fees? Cause BCash is currently winning in that regard. It’s truer to the original “Bitcoin” than Bitcoin. Not saying Bitcoin isn’t Bitcoin. Bitcoin is definitely the name brand Bitcoin. Whats with the hate though? It’s literally the same “Bitcoin” that people have been using for years just using a tool that was planned for... expandable block sizes. Pre 2017 Bitcoin is shit huh?
Edit: How many downvotes get me banned?

It literally didn’t even mention the revolutionary tech called BLOCKCHAIN. Show them why the tech is good. My friend shouldn’t have to ask me what a miner is and how transactions work after a Bitcoin introduction video.

What? You buy Bitcoin at this “atm”.

This youtube video is SHIT! It didn’t explain how Bitcoin works at all! Bitcoin “explained”?!?!?!? Didn’t even mention blockchain. Just managed to say through this 3 minute SHIT video was “Bitcoin is a currency”. Didn’t even mention miners or decentralization. Whoever made this video knows absolutely not SHIT! These uneducated fucks do us no good.
