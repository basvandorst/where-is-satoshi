We have a bunch of bitcoin currently valued at $415-$420.  If we tell you it's worth more, does that mean we have more $ now?

This infographic mentions nothing about security.  Who's going to trust who to give Bitcoins first.  Especially with "P2P Gambling".  What are you going to do if you place a bet and the guy vanishes?

Same here.  My first-time order was cancelled as well.  Was the order for a few bitcoins or less than one?  I'm trying to find out if lowering the bitcoin amount would decrease the "risk".

Dat biockchain.  Nice.
Crazy the amount of effort they go thru, plus paying for ads too!  Crazy.

If you think it's a good idea, start it up and profit from it.  I'm sure you are not the only one that feels this way.

More of a "when in rome" thing.  As long as you don't become a big fish yourself, you're just noise in the radar.  I do see what is inherently wrong with doing illegal things for personal gain, but as you can see, that's not enough reason not to do it.
Even many years in the future, we'd be idiots to believe there won't be any illegal activity, and being part of it doesn't bring the apocalypse any closer.
But this isn't philosophy class, we're not going to change anyone's life discussing this here.

What does this mean to the typical user vs the "illegal" user?

Yeah, I've never had issues.  Basically call and act clueless as to why the transaction was cancelled, ask them to run it thru the system and that's it.  The amount of CC/BTC Fraud that happens is nowhere near funny, and the banks/insurance companies are the ones who pay for it.  Anyone would get defensive if fraudsters were swindling you out of your money.
If they tell you it's because they're refusing btc transactions, then you can act somewhat irate.  Gain leverage by politely threatening to close your account (Don't assume the rep profits from keeping your account open, the rep doesn't give a shit about your account).
Calling in assuming that they cancelled it because it's related to bitcoin makes me picture a fedora/vapepen combo.  The problem is that it's too late, every company puts notes in your account explaining what the previous call was about, so changing your story is only going to make you look like more of a fraudster.

The world is indeed a shitty place.

Funny how people don't answer the question but find time to downvote you.  It be like that sometimes.

The less information they require, the easier it is to pretend to be you.  Someone could leave you a few thousand in debt just because the site did not do its due diligence.
Even companies have to go thru the same process in order to prevent an even bigger theft.
If that was to happen, either you, the business, or the insurance is going to be short a few thousand.  And the last two are definitely going to do something about it if they're ones that have to be shorted.
Though I do agree with you, it is awfully invasive.

Hey, if I could get millions illegally and get away with it, I would.  But at that point the topic would no longer be bitcoin, instead about humankind in general.  Policians/Execs get away with sleazy things all the time.
But at this point I'm just touting my fedora, let me put it away.

If you insist.

Start a business that accepts it as a form of payment.

I feel like this is a pretty poor comparison.  I don't see the connection between bitcoin mining and gold mining.

Yo yo yo!!!  Whatever you give me I'll be forwarding to the local [Fancy Rat]( rescue here in Cincinnati.
