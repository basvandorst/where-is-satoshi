This is people putting money into the cheapest coins, hoping they will go from 0.01 to 0.05 etc and making a quick 500% profit. Can’t blame them right now. I made 50% profit on reddcoin overnight just by looking at the chart and have zero care or interest in the coin.

They borrowed bitcoin from a broker and sold it, hoping to buy it back at a lower price and keep the difference.
But the price went up (and may continue to keep rising) so they have to buy back the coins at a higher price than what they sold them for and are now liable for the difference.

A Ponzi scheme is when investors pay the profits of other investors, which eventually breaks down when the investors stop coming.
A commodity is a tradable thing which inherits value from supply and demand.
Bitcoin is one of these I'll leave it up to you to decide which one. I didn't have to use Google either...

I've been close to people with bad depression and seen things like this trigger it. But ultimately the depression is there and if it's not one thing that sets it off then it will be something else.
Even if your brother got rich off bitcoin it may have been likely that something else could have triggered his depression and caused him to spiral into that black hole.
I'm really sorry for your loss.

Nobody knows mate so don't listen to what anyone on here tells you.
The only one 2 pieces of advice you need are;
1. Never invest what you can't afford to lose
2. Don't try to play the dips, just buy as soon as you can and HODL

I'm hodling my free BCC as insurance. It's been a good plan so far.
Edit: by BCC I mean Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:19:44
I’m not all in financially. I invested about $2k which is very little and right now to cash out $10k would mean nothing to me. I would rather roll the dice for the opportunity to cash out $100k in 5 years time which would be life changing.
Even though let’s say I think there’s a 60% chance my portfolio will be worth $1k in 5 years, it still makes sense to gamble on the 40% chance of hitting $100k. It’s a calculated gamble.
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:29:07
Of course I’m happy with 500% over 2 years. But you’re missing my point;  crypto is in bad shape right now. It’s been trending downwards for a sustained period of time with no relief in sight, and people are saying stupid shit like “this is good for the long term” and “yay now I can buy the dip”. Like they are happy prices are plummeting. It’s bullshit and people need to snap out of it and wake up. 
It’s ok to say things are not currently in that good a shape. I’m in the same boat as the rest of you and I wish us all success. But let’s be realists and not stick our heads in the sand whenever things aren’t going so well.
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:12:17

Surely the question has to be asked; is there an alternative to bitcoin that provides the same service, with the same level of security, at an equal efficiency that is not so wasteful of energy.
If the answer is yes (I think we all know the answer is yes many times over) then how long will it take until bitcoin is replaced at the top by the more economical, better performing currencies?
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:53:36

Fantastic contribution to the discussion!
Care to elaborate further, genius? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:51:26
Yeah people are just trying to make themselves feel better but they are talking nonsense. My portfolio is still up 500% but am I happy about that? Fuck no I’m totally pissed because 3 months ago I was up over 1500%.
All these people are in denial saying “yay now I can buy the dip”. But I highly doubt many of them are actually buying anything themselves. What’s happening is prices bounce back about 5% then tumble another 15%, rinse and repeat.
Crypto is in a lot of trouble. Yes it achieved unsustainable growth late last year but all of that has been wiped and value is still plummeting.
I’m in all or nothing at this stage but I’m more expecting my portfolio to hit $0  than to even get back to the level that it once was.
It’s time for people to be realists and accept discussion on negative trends instead of labelling it as FUD and dismissing it.
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:52:27

You’re right I’m talking about current ROI in this discussion. I thought that was clear.

How does it make me greedy that I’m pissed my portfolio has lost 2/3 if it’s value? Am I meant to be happy about it? I took the risk before most of the rest of you that’s all.
And wouldn’t everyone have wanted to sell at the top? But if we knew the top was the top we’d all be geniuses.
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:03:46
Every time there’s been any kind of dip since the ATH there’s been a lot of hate against “weak hands” who sold. 
We should stop calling them weak hands and begin calling them savvy traders as they are now in a better position than us hodlers.
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:56:42
Thanks for following that one up for us all
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:21:36
Both of those points are positive for crypto but are already in play and have not budged the overall price one bit.
My question is this; one bitcoin is still worth $7k. That’s great and all, but what the fuck can you do with a bitcoin right now that makes it worth $7k? 
There’s not a lot you can do with bitcoin today (based on adoption) that you can’t do with anything else and the only reason it’s worth so much is because people have speculated that it may be in the future. But right now it’s current price based on usefulness is about $20.
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:10:15
We are seeing constants dips then spikes, but the dips are always bigger than the spikes. It’s been like this for a while now and showing no signs of changing. I’m sure we all hope to see the trend reverse sooner rather than later.

Nice humble brag
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:57:54
Absolutely fantastic and glad I got a piece of it. But it’s down 60% in the last 3 months and that has me kind of worried. 
Anytime one of my investments plummets 60% I would immediately ask questions and it would be ignorant not to, do you agree?
Sure the good people if Reddit might provide some answers to those questions (with a few slanders and a bit of abuse mixed in from the keyboard warriors) and put my mind at ease. But it’s still healthy to discuss both sides of the coin.

The tech can still succeed while crypto currencies fall to next to nothing. I hope I’m wrong. I’ll always HODL long term because if I’m wrong I’ll make a shitload of money. But surely it’s healthy to ask questions and re-evaluate our decisions periodically.
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:21:58
On the flip side of the salty people, are the HODL bullys who initially used terms like “weak hands” for anyone who was smart enough to sell at $15k. Now look at those weak hands.
If people want to sell they should not be vilified for their decision. They should be congratulated for their smart trade. Because right now they played it better than anyone who held (including myself).

Because your coins are only worth what someone is willing to pay for them. And right now that is less than half of what it was a few weeks ago. I’m in the same boat.
You may have the same amount of coins but the current value is much less.
i.e; I’d rather have 1 bitcoin valued at $20k than 2 bitcoins valued at $9k each.
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:36:35
Stupid question (maybe): If bitcoin held in the contentious wallets becomes alt-coin (without maintaining the original BTC unlike the recent fork), does that mean the total number of real BTC in existence will reduce and the future total amount will become less than the 21 million? 
Is this possible? It would have the potential for an immediate price spike.
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:46:33
Wouldn’t the fact that such a large amount of bitcoin was locked up actually create less supply and more demand; in turn pushing up the price?
The fact that all this bitcoin has been released would increase supply (in turn lessening demand) it would now have a negative effect on the price moving forward.
All on a pretty small scale mind you.

Treat it as a lesson learned. An expensive one at that.
I held 30 ether when it was $10usd. I decided I could make more by trading it around between ether, bitcoin and litecoin. Sure, I've made a 400% gain in that time, but if I just had of hodl it on ether I would have made a 1400% gain.
My advice, HODL and have faith in your investment.
Now we all know, and there's plenty of time ahead to learn from our mistakes. Just wait until cryptos go mainstream and the money starts pouring in. This is still just the beginning.
