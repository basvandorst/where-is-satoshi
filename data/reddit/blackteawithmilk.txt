Hah, your site reminds me quite a bit of [Velir Studios](

Probably in order to demonstrate the ease of implementation and thus attempt to showcase the flexibility and power of Ethereum.
Also, because computation is costly in Ethereum, not having an efficient way to do a thing might mean it's too expensive to do at all. Demonstrating that complicated ideas are actually cost-efficient is important; if they are not, then there's not as much advantage to using Ethereum over these other projects.

Which store is this? I go to Central Square regularly but don't recognize it.

It hasn't, really. But it has made me somewhat convinced that crypto is an important, perhaps even necessary element of a truly representative system of governance.

This is the one downside I've noticed. They should really boost that.

CampBX - I like the security of having an exchange in the US that tries to keep up with regulatory compliance, etc. I occasionally use Coinbase as well. Kraken looks cool but doesn't have the volume yet.

I like how this internet newsletter blames internet newsletters for pumping up Bitcoin.

I bet they would increase their revenue by more than the price of a server if they bought another one and sped up those load times.

We already know that BTC China and OKCoin have suspended RMB deposits - this isn't new. Is there something here I am missing?

As an individual non-wealthy BTC buyer, I much prefer CampBX over Gox. Dwolla is the easiest and cheapest way for me to get money into an exchange, and CampBX being located in the US like myself gives me a bit more confidence. They really seem to care about regulatory compliance in a way that a lot of other exchanges don't, which also makes me feel better about them.

You can take beer seriously and not think Old Rasputin is the greatest drink ever.
