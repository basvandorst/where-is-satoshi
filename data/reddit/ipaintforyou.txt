to give you a better idea of what you would be getting take a look at this photo: 
it's pretty big ;)
it's yours for 0.4 BTC, shipping included which will cost ~$75 [needs to be put into a wooden crate for canvas].

so that's 0.008 btc?

depends on the size.. these are all stretched canvas on a wood frame with acrylic paint, and the depth is 1 3/4th inch. so basically you would tell me what size you would want it  [how many inches or feet width/height] then i'll let you know the cost of the materials + time.
so something like 2 feet tall by 5 feet wide would be $100 for the canvas. i can also coat the painting in shiny or matte varnish for a nice finished look.
you can show me some pictures of other stuff you like/colour schemes and i can make something similar. if you don't like it you don't have to buy it ;)

that painting is 2 feet tall by 3 feet wide... the canvas alone cost me 75 bux, so i don't think i can accept 80 mBTC, but i do appreciate the offer ;)

so, i've been a part of the bitcoin community since 2011, and today i thought that i could do more to give back and help stimulate the bitcoin economy instead of just being a passive member. the shift from fiat to bitcoin *IS* happening, and the more we all use bitcoin in our day to day life for goods and services, the more it will grow!
i have been painting abstract work for a year now, and thought it might be fun to sell my work and do custom paintings for people, but only in BTC.
if you like any of these please let me know and i'll be more than happy to sell them to you for the cost of the materials plus my time for a fair price. i'm also more than happy to paint whatever you like [abstract] using any kind of colour scheme you want.
 - let me know in the comments what you think, thanks! feel free to make some offers as well!
