Ah. I was under the impression this was also integrated into tor as a standard.

I'm actually doing a law journal write up regarding virtual currencies right now and I was also under the impression from my research that a virtual ONLY platform would seem to not be an MSB, in theory.

Bitcoin and virtual currencies are subject to capital gains tax, which is measured using the fair market value on the day that you were to sell it.
So if I buy $1000 worth of Bitcoin and cash out a few weeks later at $1500, I would technically be required to report that gain as taxable income.
If I have $1000 of US currency and it increases or decreases in value relative to the global currency exchange rates, that is not reportable as income, because the IRS uses the dollar as it's standard.
So it is treated differently from fiat money, while being classified as a property, and regulated as money.  I don't see how that isn't contradictory.

I think you could *technically* do it, but no, I don't think it's realistic.  
Maybe on a very small scale, but if you have such a little amount of cash that you are willing to, I dunno buy a vending machine and then buy all the snacks out of it with your own "dirty" money, I think you might be better off just paying for small items you actually need in cash.

I've been looking into purchasing a Bitcoin ATM and at least in my state, regulations have not yet caught up with Bitcoin, so there essentially are none.
Also, part of the reason is that as far as the law is concerned, this "ATM" is exchanging cash for a commodity (as Bitcoin is not recognized as currency), therefore it is not subject to *some* traditional banking laws.
Things like anti-money laundering protection and identification are still necessary though.

Well simplistically speaking, you can't launder thousands of dollars through a snack machine.

From this press release we saw that SR2 was doing about $8 million in sales per month.  I don't know the breakdown of individual users, but suffice to say, $8 million/month is probably a lot of people.  The vast majority of which are just buying small personal amounts.
Frankly, the police just do not have the resources to go after every single individual user who is buying an 8th of weed or an eight ball from the Bazaar, while simultaneously expending more resources cracking whatever anonymity tools and/or encryption they may have been using.
Now if someone is selling a few kilos, that's a different story.  But I think for 99% of people, it just is not worth the time, money, or effort the police would have to put in to get small time drug convictions.

Wow could you think of any more obscure, likely improbable scenarios?

Any sort of "purchase necessary" (which allowing only users who donated entry would be) would indeed turn this into a form of illegal online gambling/lottery.

Most definitely. E-filing is already implemented in most counties, but yea I think people wouldn't like being sentenced in their cell via facetime ha.

How do you feel about coinbase's cold storage, what they call "vault"?
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:09:22
I understand the analogy but a court is slightly different..
I don't think anyone would want to be judged/sentenced via the internet. Not to mention you have a right to face your accusers. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 17:24:57
Ah yes, let's give additional judicial powers to our police, they already handle their current level of authority so well!
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:54:24
But if jurors feel a law is unjust, they can refuse to convict.

It was reported that dude made anywhere from $10-40 million from the site.  Pretty sure that can buy some convincing bribes.

Um whats wrong with lottery tickets as a gift. You are completely over reacting by assuming that no one wants bitcoin as a present just because a few people that YOU know didn't. Calm the fuck down calling people "douchebags" and "dicks"

What about butterfly labs? Weren't those around 2500?
But in any case even if the btc were to stay around 230 or even have a small increase, if I mine on my home PC while I sleep and make a few coins over the course of a year of months its still free money?
