My prediction is that John McAfee has long desired to eat his dick live on national television. I suspect that he imagines it giving the pull he needs to enter the presidential race in 2024.

It's always been artists that are able to see where things will go. Reporters only report what is known, and then occasionally some "far out ideas" that aren't. "Technologists", including people like Gates, only speak about their own crap and will pivot on a dime... Remember that a few years earlier he was doing the interview circuit to tell people that the internet wasn't even a thing, and then leading up to the Windows 95 release realized he was wrong and then it was the "Bill has always been about the internet" show.

He literally just said that he is eschewing confirmation bias.

If so many people are smart to vaccinate their kids then why are there so many anti-vaxxers?

A bitcoin/blockchain informational that starts with WW2 and Enigma has some issues.

Right, so not posting stuff obviously isn't an option... It had to be maximum content on all days.

I can't tell whether John McAfee believes this or just really wants to blow himself on live TV. My suspicion is the latter.

Processing credit card transactions and being traceable does not make for good crime.

Diversify. Put 5k in a higher interest savings account, 5k in a hedge fund, and if you want put 5k in btc. If you lose 2 of these you still have 5k + returns.
