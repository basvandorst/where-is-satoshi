That it doesn't get enforced is one thing, that you can go to jail (as the law states it) is another.

Let me explain something about Venezuela for those that are just following high inflation.
As of right now is illegal for Venezuelans to trade in foreign currencies (i.e: dollars). This is called a "Control Cambiario".
Now, the government has issued an official price for the exchange of one bolivar for one dollar: 11.30 Bolivares.
As I mentioned is illegal to trade, so to get dollars you must go to the government. There are several ways you can ask for them:
If you are traveling abroad (limit is 5K per year per traveller and 400 for internet purchases per year)
If you are importing goods
And other ways but they all need to be validated and accounted for (and is almost impossible to get approved).
Now, if you want to buy dollars just because you happen to have a shit ton of Bolivares...you go to the black market. 1$ in the BlackMarket comes about 64BsF (Bolivares Fuertes). Notice the difference? Yeah, if they catch you, you go to jail.
Having said all this the case for Bitcoin is much stronger right? It is! But, who on it's right mind would sell Bitcoins for bolivares? 
I can guarantee you there are no early Bitcoin lovers down there and if they were they would sell for dollars, not bolivares.
So don't expect Venezuela to jump on board just yet...

I went with the tourist rate 
And yes is 3K for travelers, thanks for pointing that out :)

I sold low and bought high. Hell yes motherfucker...I went from 20 coins to 17 with looses and fees. 
Whatever, we are at 500+ now!

Well, you could get screwed in the process as you could receive fake bolivares for example. But if you are going down there most likely you know someone that will give you a better rate than 11.30.

I didn't want to get into the differences between dollars for Venezuelans and for tourists, I just went with the tourist rate:

There's plenty of BsF liquidity, so no.

That's the thing, is someone would be willing to do that, then that's the easiest way (ignoring the illegalities). So yeah, don't see how Vzla could be a player in BTC.
