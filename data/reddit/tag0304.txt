Yup. I knew about but didn't start investing till it was $200. I set up a monthly buy. Regardless of what it's at I buy the same amount every month, same day. Only other buy I made was that last big drop from 19k. Put more in when it hit 12k, nothing huge, always money I would have blown on silly things that month anyways. Still Hodling.

Missing the point. Its the percentage. I bought my first 2 bitcoins around then for about $240. Im by no means getting a lambo. I invest monthly a set amount for the last 4 years. Occasionally making bigger purchases when extra cash is around and Im feeling good about what the market is doing. I watched it hit $19000ish. I had already made my mind up before that I would sell off a large chunk after the first of the year (2018). Caught it while it was falling at $15000 when I sold. Doing taxes and paying my capital gains helped me see my return on investment for that sale was over 2000%. Again no lambo or retiring early but I was able to pay off almost all my debt. I didnt sell it all, and still make monthly auto purchase. Enjoying watching it again but no matter what it does Im ahead at this point. My point in making this post was in 2015 when I set my coinbase account up and got that free $1 in bitcoin I thought I was late to the game and it was pointless. I wonder if people buying now feel the same way, and 4 years from now how that will turn out. Interesting times.

Feel exactly the same way. I remember way back when signing up for the SETI where your pc would help find aliens when your screensaver was up. How the hell did I miss mining early on.

It's not about the ride, but rather the destination.

I was thinking that would be a way but unsure. The fees aren't an issue was just unsure on how it would work. Before I considered getting ledger and researched getting the shitcoins out of it with a software wallet it was basically the same way. New wallet, transfer bitcoins then recover from old private keys with no worry of bitcoins getting touched. Was just unsure of if hardware wallet changed anything, looks like not. Thanks.
