Complete nonsense.
Read it carefully. You can parse all of this TA gibberish down to:
If the price goes up from where it is now, it might continue to go up. Unless it doesn't.
If the price goes down from where it is now, it might continue to go down. Unless it doesn't.
Try it. You'll see.

This is so commonly stated, it's almost funny. But not really.
The number of buyers always exactly matches the numbers of sellers (at least in terms of volume). Hence you have the last price that btc was _traded_.

Good luck rubber hosing Ryan.
why doesn't it scale?   
security is a spectrum, and blockchains are certainly further up...  at least for verification.
fraud analysis tools, while not perfect, can drastically reduce the level of fraud. If some particular troll was hell-bent on creating multiple one-name accounts and somehow getting a bunch of pictures and and yes, "photoshopping" the shit out of them, then that pattern can be picked up.
Its rather presumptuous of you to declare with certainty that I'll be disappointed with the outcome of some hypothetical future task that hasn't taken place yet.   Maybe they'll do ok, the outcome will be fine, and everyone can be happy.  The point is you don't have a f-ing clue; nor can anyone until such event actually transpires.
