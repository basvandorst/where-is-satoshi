Thats extactly what i am talking about!
Thanks mate!
@_date: 2019-10-05 19:13:42
Yes true , I mean like they already “printed”,  if you  buy it now you get smaller quantity than someone else that bought before. You get a bit of a pie. If you invest in something undervalued you get the real deal.
And you will reply, it’s value will be increased, YES, but not the quantity of bitcoins you have.
@_date: 2019-10-28 14:39:44
True, i am new to the forum, better to keep updated advices.
@_date: 2019-10-22 09:07:34

@_date: 2019-10-23 18:33:50
Lol Hodling since 2017 without earnings ��
@_date: 2019-10-28 14:52:46
Yes , but any exchange keeps data.
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:25:21
Road to $3k
@_date: 2019-10-05 18:57:46
Okey lol at ripple, idk, hope you can explain me.
[Replaced Ripple with monero]
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:10:28
I did ✌️
@_date: 2019-10-05 19:06:10
Beacause it’s relatively expensive !
Is there any alternatives to Bitcoin?

Those chinese keep acting stupid ��
@_date: 2019-10-28 15:14:30
Thanks !!!
Sure bank tranfers are ok if the exchange doesnt keep any data that can lead to address indentify.
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:43:29
Time to sell and buy the dip at $5k.
@_date: 2019-12-31 19:32:10
It must be complex and big I guess. But if ever in the near future be the possibility to crack it. I must rethink of doing it.
@_date: 2019-12-22 20:00:44
Yeah thats true lol, kid go and see 2018, 2017 and 2016.
@_date: 2019-12-09 11:37:49

@_date: 2019-12-24 14:17:38

@_date: 2019-12-13 11:56:24
They can dump bitcoin any time.
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:26:49
That pizza looks amazing, not for the B, but for the ingredients you used . Awesome fella.
@_date: 2019-12-25 14:51:55

Omg! Thieves
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:21:07

@_date: 2019-12-17 19:48:50
Sold all mine at $8k, bought again more today. Let the losers post here.
@_date: 2019-12-07 21:03:12
@_date: 2019-12-31 18:29:28
See the past and predict the future.
@_date: 2019-10-28 14:23:12
Yes, or pay with card in a 3rd service that dont keep my Info.

@_date: 2019-12-31 19:37:32
Just the technical section matters in my case, 'cause I will just remember it. I wish out there was any calculator for this. ��
@_date: 2019-12-27 10:51:21
Please add the age-sex tag. e.g. \[13F\]
@_date: 2019-12-07 22:36:07
Eth for the win! Bitcoin max 25% jump.
@_date: 2019-12-06 21:35:40
The end of fiat doesn't mean the peak of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-18 12:49:22
We said $5k.
@_date: 2019-12-30 22:40:13
Governments manipulate the market to enhance their fiat. Not just BTC value goes down but every altcoin does.
Food for thought.
@_date: 2019-12-31 20:07:20
That number is bigger that the possible addresses. So I guess it covers all the possibilities.
@_date: 2019-12-23 17:56:52
$10k has been confirmed for this easter.
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:12:50
Yeah sure why not
@_date: 2019-12-31 19:42:30
Okey gotcha. So like 65\^90?


@_date: 2019-12-10 22:56:58
Yes, but keep in mind that governments set the currency that they use. They would never choose a cryptocurrency made by me or you, they will make their own.
@_date: 2019-12-31 19:34:37
Mate yes, but even this is not as safe as it could be. I mean your brain is the most important tool if you lose it you lose your life, so doesnt  matter if you lose the bitcoin, unless someone guess the big password. Another option is seed, but seed generates multiple addresses.✌
@_date: 2019-12-29 19:51:19
Yes but for limited time.
@_date: 2019-12-22 21:26:28
That guy made himself a billionaire from nothing !��
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:15:15
Tommorow? LOL :'D
