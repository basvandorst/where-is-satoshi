Yes, it's called the SDR.
They can't print an unlimited amount of it and since the IMF is not a country, it can never be a currency with a trade deficit.  Plus, people are so stupid that they'll believe it's backed by something even though the SDR is pure fiat.

YOURS is an interesting idea, but I remain skeptical how it will work.  If a person sends a micropayment to an author of a post that assumes that a person *will pay for what they read*, which I don't see being possible.
If YOURS intends to charge advertisers across the platform and advertisers must use bitcoin, then I see how this works, as good content is rewarded from the overall advertising trickling to top producers and content providers throughout the network (with people generating the most views getting highest payouts and on down).  From reading about YOURS, it seems they want readers to pay for content.  I just don't see that happening, even if we're talking about 0.000001 BTC.

With you.  From what I gather Coinbase is insured, or they claim to be.  If a *cheaper* site is hacked, and then users face a bail-in by losing 30-50%, how well did that work out for them?
Besides, I think many of us experts here know the times to buy bitcoin, like the latest dip.  So, if I have to pay Coinbase a 5% fee on my purchases, but I'm getting cheap bitcoins, like $501, who cares?
My only complaint on Coinbase during this last dip was that their site wasn't responding when bitcoin was cheap!
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:24:45

Excellent points Joequant; you are forgetting one thing - the older generation is passing and a new generation is rising.

If bitcoin is still around then, look out - it will be much higher than today.

Texas is strict with money laws, like they are strict with housing laws.  For instance, Texas won't allow people to borrow too much against their home and this was one reason that the housing bubble didn't impact Texas, like other states.  The same is true with money; there are more laws to comply with in Texas.
[Now, Texas wants its gold back and will start a gold bank](  They're also very pro-bitcoin there too.  It's a very weird state.

NO NO NO.
Bitcoin is digital, not physical.  Bitcoin is **NOT** an alternative to physical cash.  Gold is because gold is physical.  Bitcoin is good for many things, but it is still *digital* and one should not move their physical wealth allocation into bitcoin - you move physical wealth allocation into other physical money, like gold.  Bitcoin is an alternative to digital Dollars, Euros, Yuans, but it is not an alternative to physical Dollars, Euros, Yuans.
Mark my words, if you take your physical money and put it into any digital money, you will live to regret it.  The IRS has already proven they can easily confiscate bitcoins when they need to; the same will be true for *any* cryptocurrency.  Physical money is physical money; keep what you allocate toward physical, physical.
Finally, enough with this bullshit about bitcoin being anonymous.  It is not.  It has never been.  Again, the IRS has proven they can track anyone through the blockchain and it will only increase.  If they can do it, so can others.  Stop spreading misinformed information; it is very dangerous.

Yeah, Counterparty is a great smart contract system that doesn't get quite as much attention as some of the others even though it's built on Bitcoin's blockchain.  The best part is that it contributes to the Bitcoin network:


As for the currency, it requires that bitcoin exists, so it's not a competitor at all and anyone during the [starting period could have owned an equal amount of XCP]( - which is unheard of for a crypto-currency, as there was no insider advantage.  A very well-thought out decentralized smart contract system and one that works inherently *with* bitcoin.

Bitcoiners on the reddit make no sense.  You want exchanges to charge next to nothing in fees, yet you want them to reimburse you in loss.
How are they supposed to have the money to pay for insurance?  Where are they getting this from?  As someone who owns several businesses, *if you can't make money, you can't do things for your customers*.  Honestly, this is what happens when you get an exchange that charges low fees - they don't have the money set aside to cover you in a loss.
[See how stupid most of you are]( - complaining about Coinbases' fees.  Yet *why do you think Coinbase is upping its fees*?  Some of it is because they are using that money to buy insurance to protect you.
You cannot have it all ways; you will not be protected or insured on a site that charges very little fees.  Where are they getting the money to buy the insurance to protect you?  Frankly, this is what happens when you raise a retard generation (Millennials) who doesn't understand basic business, insurance and profit models.
I want the exchanges I work with to make money because, like Coinbase, they will be able to insure what I have.  You got cheap and now look at where you are!

Yes, there will always be corrections.  The real question is how low will this correction be?  If history is a guide, when bitcoin hits its highest point, its lowest point from there should - in theory - be higher than its lowest point of this past correction (slightly below $200 only briefly).

(If the market set the cost of water right now, water would cost about $6 a gallon.  Taxpayers are subsidizing this, but with China, India and the US in a massive drought, it's only a matter of time before the shit hits the fan.  "Abundance" lol.)

@_date: 2016-06-05 15:58:18
Let's suppose that you're right and take it a little bit further to an extreme where only one company owns over 51% of the mining:
1.  It doesn't matter because there are other competitive cryptocurrencies which users can switch to if bitcoin becomes uncompetitive.  Unlike fiat systems, bitcoin does not force users to be a part of, meaning we can pack up our bitcoins and leave at any time.  If miners are wise, they'll know that they need users, so they'll make sure their rules are fair for users.  If not, we're gone.
2.  Mining needs to be profitable to an extent, otherwise it all ends anyway.  The same is true with oil; if oil is too high for consumers, consumers will find other systems (and they are thanks to the greedy oil companies).  But if oil prices are too low, no one can produce.  When Rockefeller controlled most of the oil in the US- look at the price - it was well balanced for producers and consumers.  We still need producers to be incentivized, otherwise there is no system.  Only a socialistictard would think producers are bad.
3.  Basically, the first two points highlight the equilibrium of bitcoin and mining; this must exist in all good systems and we should always expect some conflict.  Conflict is inherent in all good systems because producers and consumers have differing interests.
4.  Since some of the large mining allows smaller users to own shares of mining, those users have voting power as well.  This was brought up by another user; allowing smaller users to own shares is the best interest of some mining companies, as it hedges their risk in addition to making sure they aren't engaging in actions that only benefit them, which would hurt them if everyone abandons bitcoin.
5.  Hardware innovations may arise out of all of this conflict of small miners vs. big miners.  Be careful about underestimating hardware innovation; what we think of as being limits today may be jokes of tomorrow.
6.  We should welcome massive flaws in bitcoin being exposed, and let's suppose that this is one.  Either bitcoin addresses it, or it's over.  That's it; large miners will have to take note - they may create their own extinction.  Or they may not.  Still, flaws lead to the creation of improving the system or a superior system.  Welcome to capitalism!

I don't think Brexit is as important to bitcoin as people think.  In the US timezones, for instance, bitcoin ranged from $651-$666 throughout the day after Brexit.  *It's now at $673*.  If the price before Brexit was $651, even at its current price over 24 hours later of $673 shows only a $22 increase.
The bottom line is that Brexit had less of an impact on bitcoin as it did on gold (which had a $59 increase - and quickly became one of the most searched for items on Google: 
Sometimes people get so enthusiastic that they twist data and here is no exception.  The truth is that 24 hours post Brexit, bitcoin has done very little relative to its starting position.  It may do quite a bit later, but that may be less related to Brexit than posters here are wanting and more related to other events or opportunities, like the halvening, etc.

Returns by year?  I don't think you can say that for 2009  due to limited data; 2010 we might have some data since there were slightly more users and MtGox started in July of that year.  Per Bitstamp's graph:
2011:  Earliest value is $10.90 and ending value is $4
2012:  Starting value is $5 and ending value is $13
2013:  Starting value is $13 and ending value is $732
2014:  Starting value is $784 and ending value is $321
2015:  Starting value is $315 and ending value is $433

You're the lender to the people borrowing bitcoins and trading.  Like all borrowing, they have to pay an interest rate and the interest rate according to Bsave is generally higher during periods of volatility because that attracts traders, while lower during periods of low volatility.

For those who prefer a quick summary over media bloviating:
1.  Investability: bitcoin is a liquid investment class.
2.  Politico-Economic Profile: bitcoin is governed by a mathematical network with inherent systematic integrity over a small group of fiat owners who can print money whenever they feel like it.
3.  Price not correllated with other assets: simply put - bitcoin's price doesn't appear to be affected by other mainstream assets, like stocks, gold and bonds.
4.  Bitcoin's risk-reward profile: it's not bad at all; for an example, using the last three years, it is only slightly under-performing US stocks, while outperforming gold, oil, and emerging markets.

Have you seen the documentary Poverty, Inc?  It agrees with your point - most charity creates a dependency on charity and destroys people in the long run.
Fundamentally, people who give money just want "the feels" and they don't care what actually happens.  Self-righteousness feels good, even if it ends up harming the recipient.  The documentary shows that donations harm the entrepreneurs in a community, who are actually working to build communities.  But "feelers" don't care - they're self-righteous and just want to feel good.
All charity harms.  Rather than charity, expect a return from your money - this encourages people to think in a larger scope than what they receive and produces more for their community.

2.  To get people used to digital money to set the stage for either outright confiscation, or outlawing other forms of digital money.
3.  To promote the SDR, which is pure electronic fiat.  Once all cash is eliminated, they will ban gold next and sell this as "bitcoin will rise" with useful idiots from the bitcoin community agreeing.  Then with gold gone, they will ban bitcon and force everyone to use the SDR.

No because the person is letting people know that he thinks its a Ponzi scheme.  Unless the company actually says, "We're a ponzi scheme" no one has absolute proof that it is.  They just *assume* that it is because the profits seem unreasonable.  However, I've seen multiple legitimate businesses give away thousands of dollars in the beginning with the hope that it retains people over the long run.  So while the beginning is a ponzi-like scheme, the long run results in success.
Saying, "If you deposit $5, we'll get you 100% return by the end of this year" is very similar to saying, "Sign up and we'll give you $10" (PayPal did this).  Both would have seemed like a ponzi to me and I would have taken advantage of them, but in the case of PayPal I would have been wrong - it wasn't a ponzi scheme.
So no, one's suspicion does not prove that something is a ponzi, therefore if I think I can profit from one I'll say this is a ponzi and try to make money, but hell, I could be wrong.  I thought PayPal was a ponzi and a half and boy was I wrong, lol.

This crop of people who don't grasp inflationary currencies or dilution makes me realize why our monetary system is terrible.  If a stock extends more shares (dilution) because they need to raise money for an addition on to their business (like buying more homes for a REIT), that's one thing.  But just issuing more shares for the sake of doing so, or issuing more currency for the sake of doing so, often benefits the people at the top at the expense of the smaller owners.

This is what Evan Duffield warned the bitcoin community a while ago about privacy and money - you're seeing it play out in front of you.
If someone violates a law and then uses the money they made from the crime to pay me, as a merchant, I don't know how they're receiving money, I only am trying to make money for my business.  Cash resolves this problem because cash is untraceable and no one can know if this cash or that cash was used in some crime.
Bitcoin is a major problem here - there are major analytics firms who track every bitcoin transaction, so even if you started a new wallet to receive bitcoin, it would still carry the "crime" stigma since those coins were tracked as a part of crime (plus, your new wallet might be suspect to be a way in which the criminal is hiding his money, possibly making you a target).
I don't feel sorry for the bitcoin community here; you were all warned this was a major problem.  **Bitcoin has never been and will never be anonymous** and anyone who tells you otherwise is either a liar or an idiot.  This should have been an early problem to deal with, but no, this whole community just doesn't care until it bites you in the face.
My business does not and will not take bitcoin because it's a huge risk that I receive bitcoins that are a part of something which I don't want to be attached to.  I suggest you terminate your relationship with it as soon as possible too.

OpenBazaar provides an excellent example of how someone in bitcoin might never need to go back to the traditional banking system (ie: convert bitcoins back to fiat).  The only challenge is that most sellers still measure goods in fiat, so they adjust their prices based on fiat.  Once the shift occurs, it will be interesting.

Some China, some halving, some mining, but the big difference this time versus last time ...
Negative interest rates in Europe and Japan (Bitcoin just got approval there).  When interest rates are negative, holding bitcoin and gold pay interest.  Most people don't know about bitcoin, but as it rises, more people learn about it and with negative rates this time around, they begin to realize that they can hold something that isn't taking money from them.

Part of the demand started as more market participants understood QE3.  That one felt more confusing than the other QEs and wasn't as supported as much as QE1 was (by even mainstreamers).  Like the other QEs, speculative investments overshot like crazy shortly after it and sold off most of their gains - bitcoin was similar.  By the end of QE3, it was down  about 70% from its high.

Instability in Venezuela is just as much of a reason.  Instability in public markets - in general - is also a reason.  Also, with negative interest rates, bitcoin and gold pay interest.

The purpose of basic income has always been to create inflation; governments have too much debt and they need an easy way out.  Most people are useful idiots begging for free money, even though they don't realize that the money they're getting will be significantly devalued in time - making their "basic income" the new poverty.
Self-reliance will get tougher and tougher, but let's not forget how useful it has been.  Never side with the majority and the majority will want free money, even if it means they lose their ability to be free.

I think AA's view of the *ETH* hard fork vs. the banking bailouts is that most in the *ETH* community supported the hard fork, whereas the bank bailouts were passed by "elites" while the populations said no.
To be fair, I haven't seen a poll of the whole community, but in the case of comparing the*ETH* hard fork to the bail outs, there was a lot more support from the community on the former, while the latter was blatant pocket lining.
This isn't to say that both didn't try to undo failure; that's still a worthy debate.

Answer this question:


If a government makes it illegal to own bitcoin in its jurisdiction, that's fine, but like the gold law you mention, **it only means that bitcoin is illegal in its jurisdiction**.  If an American owned gold in Switzerland, the 1933 law meant nothing to him because his gold was in Switzerland, not the US.  The same is true with bitcoin; if you own bitcoin in 10 different countries, you should follow the laws of those 10 different countries, but if only one makes it illegal, that's still **only one country**.
You follow the law of the land, not the law of the "other" land.  China cannot pass a law against citizens of Germany that directly affects Germans in their border, like "You cannot own more than 10 ounces of copper in your German home."
As for the other questions:
1A:  Not necessarily.  See above.
1B:  See above.
1C:  No one really knows what the Chinese think outside of the Chinese; ask them.
2:  No.
2A: If capital controls are coming, there is a whole host of others things you should own instead of everything you listed because *of the effects of capital controls*.  Ask yourself this, "What will be the effects of capital controls on everyone around you?"  That will tell you what you want to own.

Because *most politicians have law degrees*.  Clinton, Obama, Clinton (again).  How many politicians
-  Have run a business?
-  Have failed in business and still pursued the idea after failure (anyone can give up, who can press on)?
-  Have actually worked in private business to understand resource use and allocation and wise management of resources?
-  Have tried setting up a business to see the regulatory nightmare (just because you aren't doing the right thing when you set one up, doesn't mean you can't be later sued)?
-  Actually have experience in the *industry* that they want to clean up?
Trump is an entrepreneur and meets most of those.  Almost every politician we've had fails on all of them; a few pass one or two items.
