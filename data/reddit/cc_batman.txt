How much money has Grayscale lost this year? $170+ million is last I saw. Yeah, follow them.

Bitcoin will never get the amount of news coverage it received last year. That's just how bubbles work.

You’re clueless. You two have been lied too, and you’re just parroting what people have conditioned you to think. 
I bet you also think OTC markets are super busy right now too? 
Basically, you’re a crypto NPC.

This story is simply fake news, look at the damn data yourself

Good luck. ��

Thank you, I now see the error in my thinking, and fully see and embrace the light of cryptocurrencies. Where do I send my worthless fiat?

Nerve struck...sure I believe you.

Bitcoin is a shitcoin.

It’s an interesting article even if misguided.

Yes, keep averaging your $100 portfolio. Go you. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:24:16
No one is trying to be edgy you dipshit. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:23:30
LOL 
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:08:55
you have diarrhea a lot, you should get that checked out. Good luck on your tiny portfolio.

Oh, we are back to comparing crypto to the stock market again. 
Averaging down on losing positions, especially those at 90% loss, is so foolish. No one with an ounce of financial experience would recommend doing this. 
But hey, I’m sure you read differently on your bitcoin sites, they won’t lead you wrong.

u/spartacus0009 is not wrong, look at the data, this story is fake news.
