There’s no conceivable way a socialist society will be able to exist once Cryptocurrency is mainstream :)
@_date: 2018-08-25 01:34:29
Well of course most people are against corporatism, but it’s the socialists among others who indirectly or directly create corporatism by creating a state big enough to involve itself in the economy. (corporate bailouts, subsidies, regulatory capture etc)

Private prisons are merely subcontracted to third parties, and aren’t under the conditions of private law. The fact that you believe this to be an example of how a free market operates negates everything else you’ve said.
@_date: 2018-08-25 01:43:03
You’re implying said services wouldn’t exist without the government. There’s a lot of literature on how private law could work, check out “Machinery of Freedom” by David Friedman on YouTube which gives a brief explanation. You seem to think that the government is the one filling the demand for a service which otherwise wouldn’t exist, when all a government service is, is a monopoly. Once the market provides said services, we can deduce from our knowledge of how competition works that prices would decrease over time and quality would increase.

Maybe you define socialism differently, but “public ownership over the means of production, exchange and distribution” doesn’t seem very free to me, and runs explicitly contrary to crypto which is essentially private currency.

If land is leased out to private holders for the long term, how is it operating any differently day to day than if it were completely private owned?

I never claimed to be for central banking. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 16:14:09
“The 1%” owning more wealth than 90% of the population isn’t solely due to low interest rates of central banks, which is what the title is claiming.

Why does it affect you how much richer I am than you? 
@_date: 2018-05-16 15:47:00
Yes the state protects the ultra elite to some extent; that doesn’t mean you get to scapegoat people who do well for themselves by using the Marxist rhetoric of “muh 1%”.

As far as I’m aware he doesn’t think churches should be forced to accept gay marriages, and he thinks drugs legalisation should be decided by the states. While I may slightly disagree with him, that’s hardly “socially authoritarian”, especially when considered to the Alt Right and the Regressive Left.

We could start by abolishing patents, copyright and lobbied regulations all of which protect big companies from the threat of competition. In a free market, other than natural monopolies (which the state may have a role for) monopolies only form when a company is selling a good or service that consumers enjoy enough for the firm to be in that position, e.g. Apple. Few people complain about Apple’s huge market share because they provide a great good that benefits the lives of millions of people, however it still doesn’t help when the government protects Apple with a patent which means that nobody else can copy their phone design.

Blockchain technology directly threatens government power, which also means corporatism and unemployment (caused by minimum wage laws, occupational licensing, labour unions and welfare traps.)

Unfortunately since property rights don’t exist to a very large degree around the world, companies are able to use unsustainable means of finding energy which would not exist under a free market. It’s a complex issue which I don’t know how to address.

No problem, we need more public debate.

For something to be “in the free market” it needs to be free from the initiation of force from third parties, whether that be governments or other entities. Land isn’t removed from the market merely because somebody owns it, that makes no sense. It’s open to changing market forces of supply and demand all the time
@_date: 2018-04-14 01:10:59
Price is forced down due to competition which causes more innovation and more efficiency. 
I don’t understand your second point, most people would just use insurance.

Slavery is the complete antithesis of Capitalism. Private ownerershio over the means of production (which starts with your own body) runs directly contradictory to the idea of slavery.
And yes most scarce resources should be left to market forces which allocate resources more efficiently than any other system.

We already pay for fire stations without receiving much benefit via taxes. The free market would do a much better job by offering different insurance plans and bringing down prices, as well giving people the option to opt out.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:24:17
Not saying that, only saying that the state rapidly worsens inequality through the methods I explained above. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:12:08
Not an Ancap but when has a capitalist anarchy ever existed? The closest to pure capitalism I’m aware of is 18th century United States (minus the slavery part).

No, it’s not obvious that money gets  in the way of us doing what we love. The money we receive is merely a means of trading each other’s value (in a free market) hence why very productive people like Bill Gates get rich since they provide value to millions of people around the world, and then vice versa with people who don’t produce much or any value. Again you use the analogy of a heart hoearding all its blood at the expense of other organs which is in no way comparable to our current system since wealth is created, we don’t live in a zero sum economy but rather everyone’s quality of life improves at different rates.

Automation has been happening rapidly for the past 200 years and has not lead to a decrease in employment, in fact quite the opposite as new industries spring up offering new jobs that had never existed before. If you want to fix the issue of employability, fight against the minimum wage, occupational licenses, and taxation all of which decrease the amount of jobs available.
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:25:53
What’s a “healthy system”? And you have to actually explain why money acts as a roadblock to transactions from an economics standpoint.

What’s wrong with money?
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:30:11
Again I’m not against government, just stating the Ancap argument to the best of my knowledge. Government should exist to protect people’s rights in my opinion. On your question on food, the food industry is very free market in the West, and obesity is a far, far bigger issue than malnourishment which speaks to how great capitalism is.
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:48:29
Money is merely a medium of exchange, it’s allows us to barter but is far more fair and efficient. You can’t blame it for what bad actions some individuals choose to take with it.

You don’t “leave the market” merely for deciding to keep something in the long term. Market forces will affect the price of the property constantly based off of external factors such as geography and population to name a few. Regardless, most people move at some time in their life.
