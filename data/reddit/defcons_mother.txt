Look at the original paper [here]( at page 10.
SR2 was hacked on February 13, some days after MtGox. As you can see on the paper, malleated TXs went through the roof before February 13, with about 300k coins implicated at the time of the hack (since people set up malicious nodes to DDoS Bitcoin with malleated TXs).
Therefore the information you are posting is FALSE.

The amount of misinformation on SR2 on is staggering. It's almost like it's being posted by DEA trolls or something.
They have kind-of explained how the bitcoins were stolen. It was apparently through transaction malleability and a bug in the "Check for new deposits" option. They never posted the specifics but I think it's a very plausible explanation that their code had a bug that considered both the original and malleated TXs valid deposits so the account was credited twice.
The "long con" conspiracy theory is just retarded. SR has plenty of competence with markets which implement stuff like in-browser PGP, multisig TXs, better escrow and lower fees. The only thing it has going for it is a lot more popularity and vendors. It was a miracle that it survived after the hack and I'm sure defcon didn't expect it to survive either.
The "admins make fake vendor accounts to scam users" thing, this actually be true, but why the hell does no one ever post any actual hard evidence about it? By the way, yes, there are a lot of scammy vendors, and it's quite easy for them to fake reputation, without the help of the admins. You have to do some research on your vendor before buying. There are also plenty of legit vendors.
And don't get me started on the "SR is the cops" conspiracy theorists. Yes, sure, the cops are behind a site that has helped ship drugs to my home and doesn't know who the hell I am because I mixed my coins and used PGP.
**PSA:** You can buy drugs on SR2

Yes, there is some risk in providing your postal address. It's the riskiest part of the process.
Usually you provide your regular address with real names and everything, encrypted with PGP so only the vendor can see it. There is some risk that the vendor is busted and your address gets to the cops, but:
* If your vendor takes adequate care, then this shouldn't happen.
* If you just ordered a small quantity then they will probably not bother about it really.
* There's no proof that you did the order. Anyone can send anyone anything.
* For the above reason they are also unlikely to get any search warrant unless they can prove that you have accepted the package, by making you sign for it. You should never sign for any packages.
Case in point: When the original SR was busted a few vendors were also busted because of bad OPSEC by them and DPR. Some people on reported police showing at their doors, not with a warrant but just trying to get them to incriminate themselves.
What enolja says about fake IDs is unusual for regular customers. Using fake IDs doesn't protect you about most kind of busts and will only make things worse when you are. It may only be useful in some vendor/bulk stuff.

I have just started clicking random vendors from SR2 from the front page of various categories (i.e. where 99% of the users find who to order from) and all of them are oldish vendors with good reputation, and I have ordered from many of them with no problems.
I have never been scammed, and it takes me about 5 minutes to be almost sure that a vendor is legit on the site.
Anyway, you are the one making the accusation, so stop spreading FUD without proof. How about you go about it and post evidence (like screenshots or things checkable on the site) about **new vendors** who are **actively scamming users** with the help of the **admins**?

It's not illegal to go to the SR2 website. And the screenshots don't have to include any personal details.
Also, seems legit, seeing you seem quite comfortable talking about SR2 on your Reddit.
EDIT: Or just download Tor and create a new reddit account then post the proof anonymously.

To contrast with other users here who have said they have not been repaid, I have been repaid more than half of my pending amount.
You can also see a lot of reports of users being repaid on [(Tor recommended) or the [SR2 forums]( (Tor required).

I already suggested how it *might* have worked, though they haven't released the info. Maybe there was a bug that resulted in the code responsible for checking deposits considering both the original and the malleated TXs valid (basically a 0 confirmation bug). Maybe it was something entirely different, idk. But most if not all which has been said by defcon adds up.
EDIT: Another plausible explanation (probably more than my first one) is the same one being discussed in the MtGox case, withdrawal TXs being malleated in order to fool the system into thinking the withdrawal didn't go through, because the mined withdrawal TX had a different TXid. The system may have automatically refunded the account if it detected the withdrawal TXid was not in the blockchain.
