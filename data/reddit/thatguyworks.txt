Start? They've been doing this for years.

I started dollar cost averaging back in June (when it was ~$2400). Nothing huge. I pumped a lot more in late October.
It's been a wild ride, but I want to take my winnings and go home. It's just so exhausting. I want to pay off some stuff. Get that cushion. I'll continue dollar cost averaging for the future though.

Self identified Republican.
Admittedly, the line between troll and GOP is getting rather blurry.

Same here. I'd been dollar cost averaging since June, but then just decided to dump a portion of my savings in to see what happens. Been very happy so far.

Yeah this is obviously the worry. And I'm kind of a newbie when it comes to all of this. I actually started dollar cost averaging back in June when the price was around $2400. Just like $50 out of every paycheck. Nothing huge. 
But the thing I've noticed, especially recently, is what appears to be consistent runup followed by brief dips when some whale makes a splash. Then a rebound and further growth.
Clearly nothing is guaranteed and this is all just gambling, but if this trend continues it feels as if one could count on a dip happening. If you always make sure you buy at less than you sold (and don't get crazy and set the order for $20 bucks or something), you'd always gain a slight edge. Keep it reasonable. $500 under sell price, or whatever. 
And the fact GDAX doesn't charge fees on limit orders makes it even more tempting.
I guess I'm just looking for reasons to talk myself out of trying this.

That's what I figured. However we're only talking about a $100 initial investment here. Are capital gains tied to your income bracket? I'm not worried about a couple bucks of profit kicking me up into a different tax bracket. 
But if they're not tied to your income bracket I might think twice.

Just got to my first 0.1 today.
Started putting in around $50/mo back in early June when it was around $2200. Figured why not? I just automated the purchase every paycheck and forgot about it.
But this latest rally has me upping the ante hardcore.

Dollar cost averaging over time.
Smaller investments at regular intervals over the long term.
