Well, that wouldn't be an issue if we legalized and gave people the freedom to control their bodies back. But that my friend is a whole another issue

It's no secret that bitcoin is used for illegal activity, but does that give the government the right to shut it down? I'm sure the DEA has some interest in doing just that..
Bitcoin has many legit uses and is better off left untouched by bureaucrats in my opinion. Regulation is going to put a dent in the very reason bitcoin was founded.

It's about time they look into this. Currently, obtaining bitcoins is too slow and annoying of a process. I have to go to bitinstant, then drive to CVS and do it through ZipZap just to exchange cash for bitcoins..
The outlook for bitcoins, providing the fucking government doesn't stick its nose in it, looks very good
Edit: Providing a faster process provides the same level of anonymity that I currently get, despite the slow process. CVS never IDs

I just bought in the nick of time yesterday when they were at $52. I just checked the price and shit myself a bit.

I'm glad they aren't asking for ID for everyone. That's a good thing.. I have had a friend get ID'd for some reason which is why I said that.

I've noticed that Bit Floor sometimes is a dollar or two more expensive per bitcoin then MtGox. Like right at this moment, MtGox is $108.90 compared to $110 on BitFloor. I've noticed this difference many times before too. LocalTill does often have a lower processing fee than ZipZap though, which is who I normally go through. 
I also prefer going through CVS or walmart instead of Bank of America simply because I can use a fake name without being ID'd. I would prefer to stay as anonymous as possible.

People need to recognize the difference here between LR and Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an anonymous, decentralized peer-to-peer network. It has no head of a snake to cut off, as LR did. THE MOST they could do is make the exchanges illegal to operate inside the US, but even then, no huge cause for concern.

I think though that a process where I can access bitcoins for cash in one simple step, similar to BitFloor and Bank of America is needed. The bad part of that is the source of the purchase is easily traceable. 
My main concern is anonymity and regulation. The government is bound to stick it's nose in bitcoin further the more businesses develop around bitcoins. Like you said, it's a rebellion against the failed concepts of central banking. 
I hope for the consumer's sake, bitcoin can grow without delay and without the government throwing the books at them.
