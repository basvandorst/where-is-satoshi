BROTHERS :P
I  don't know what is child pays per parent payment???
I understand by deduction - i may pay up missing fees to make it confirmed faster and move the whole transaction chain?
Where i should put this payment - how do i count how much to pay
(sum of fees) and i need to send from any btc adress or from the one where is my money stuck :P
Thanks for patience - i finaly found good place- i was already asking this at localbitcoin but no serious answer thank you guys
Just bitcoin is more complicated than i even tought ;) I already started filling gaps and it's really even more advanced and amazin than i imagined lol
But this shit sucks - didn't even knew i have accepting such payments and i didn't look closely ;) Next time i will be wisely 
Ps . i got 10 cents spendable but if i know how much  would to get
