I guess a lot of that 85% is made up of developing countries where the technology isn't in place for credit and debit cards to be widely used. This seems an area of real promise for bitcoin where adoption could be rapid.

This is interesting and I think you might be educating me about the blockchain slightly more here; I'm a very casual bitcoin user at the moment. 
If you have your 1btc on Mars and transfer it to the "solar" blockchain and double spend on a spaceship, the seller isn't going to give you the ship until it confirms. At which point it either does confirm and fails for the transfer to solar or fails and transfers to solar.
The solar blockchain acts as a ledger to balance between earth and Mars. It won't add the btc to earths blockchain without confirmation it's been removed from Mars first.

I'm probably not explaining it properly but I'm imagining that the Martian bitcoin would move from their blockchain to the "solar" blockchain then from their to the terran/earth blockchain. Therefore it would have to have confirmation on the solar blockchain before it could transfer to earth. Maybe.

This was my first thought about how it could work. As long as the time for physical travel between the planets and also sub-blockchains is more than the time it takes to sync with the main blockchain then that would prevent double spending. 
I guess the main issue is how long it takes for an economy to develop on Mars. No point having money if there is nothing to buy. I guess if Elon gets his way though there will at least be pizza places fairly soon.

I was wondering recently if the default was changed so the units were commonly displayed as say micro BTC rather than BTC if it would change the price much as people would feel they are buying more because the decimal point has moved. Just the psychology of it.
