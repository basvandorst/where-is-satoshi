Saw someone else with a lost access to email ticket in. He received a similar email stating:
Thank you for contacting Coinbase Support. I apologize for the delay in responding to your email and for all the trouble.
I’m working with a specialist to review and finalize your balance transfer. We will follow-up as soon as the transfer is complete, or if we have any further questions.
Anyway, I hope there is a balance in there. Perhaps they would use a different descriptor if no balance existed.....just to avoid confusion / leading the customer on. Whatever. fingers fucking crossed people

Hi Everyone, back in 2013 - 2014 I purchased Bitcoins (very small amount) in a Coinbase account tied to my work email. Since then my access had been removed cause I got a new job. I cannot remember if I sold or not. I put a ticket in with Coinbase a while ago and they finally got back to me. They said "we are working with a specialist to approve your balance transfer. We will reach out once the transfer if complete".....hope this means something is still there! -- if so, should I sell or hold? Money needs are not very immediate now and I do hold a very small amount of Litecoin....Hoping for the best, It is kind of nerve inducing :) Thanks!

Hey everyone, Litecoin Hodler here, but I am very happy to hear this news for us both. The future looks very interesting!

Thank you for this. If we are talking BIG money here, they may have a vested interest in controlling how the public perceives the futures market. If the money is big enough they might view the cost of manipulation as justifiable so that going forward the volatility will always be there. 
If I have that kind of money to truly influence something as new as Bitcoin futures....maybe I would.

You sound stupid. The effort put forth in this sub Reddit contributed to the CEO publicly acknowledging the effort to correct it. We are frustrated, not desperate sir.

ANd those atomic swaps! 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:59:16
Great adoption! Can't wait to donate to Live at the Bike stream. I hold LTC so it'll be a little bit but a win for us both none the less!!
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:42:34
I'd buy between2-10 buckets. But since I hold LTC I can't do that just yet. So everyone with BTC please purchase a few buckets for ya boi over here. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:10:49
This is great!
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:56:23
That is amazing! Cannot wait
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:11:40
Yea. I  have been following Litecoin but haven't been as active on BTC. With futures coming up maybe it wouldbt be best time to sell into....also I am so freaking pumped for LN and atomic swaps. I am not very knowledgeable, but at a low level they both look incredible!

Also, Twitch was bought out by Amazon back in 2014 I believe for almost 1 billion. Let's send a positive message back to the mother ship. !!
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:50:44
This is excellent! Upvote this shit :)
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:57:05

Did I just get an alert telling me Zap! has released a beta lightning wallet&gt;&gt;&gt;
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:59:45
It's great that nobody has mentioned the futures expiring today. Even if they're net long, this is GREAT! If we're up like this at market close, it 's off to the races.
