I believe in smarter people than me who believe in the tech

Ya that's what I was thinking too. I'll check out breadwallet. Thanks! So maybe I can just run this by you, the process for me buying and storing my bitcoin would be: Open account on coinbase and put in some money, login to gdax(with same login as coinbase) transfer funds over, buy bitcoin on gdax market, transfer btc to breadwallet, wait for sweet sweet medievil bitcoin to pile up. Is this correct?

To be honest I don't even have a virus scanner on my pc. I do however have an Ipad I just bought yesterday, That would probably be the best place to store right? the only problem is I can't seem to find a wallet as trusted as Electrum for IOS. Maybe I will look into a paper wallet. I dunno though that seems a bit over protective almost. especially as this will only be short term until my hardware wallet arrives.

Ehhh I'm not very good at waiting.. I must cave to my impulsive nature or else implode

Ok well now I’ve decided to go with coinsquare, I’ve read good reviews and they seem more geared toward Canadian traders. Just awaiting verification now
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:17:31
One can hope. There is a lot of talk of a ‘bubble’. But they’ve also talked of my housing market being a bubble for years and it hasn’t slowed at all. Not that they’re the same thing of course
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:17:09
Wow that still seems like quite the process to go thru, especially as I plan on investing incrementally 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:15:55
Ok thanks for the advice I’ll look into coinsquare
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:10:52
IOTA? Sorry, I know very little
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:49:10
Ok cool. Also I'm buying in Canada, would that change anything? Like is there any unforeseen charges I should expect?
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:19:44
that is how it seems. But also it's making me feel anxious to buy, as if it's a train that's just not gonna stop.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:53:48
Limit orders is like if I preset to buy $500cad worth if the value dips under $7000 is that correct..?
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:09:32
Yes good call, someone else here recommended breadwallet, so I'm gonna check that out in the meantime. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:40:44
I might put a sizeable amount in other things now (lite coin, ethereum, doge) I feel like all the attention bitcoin is getting will have to transfer over to other cryptos eventually
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:25:18
Hey thanks I’ll check out that show. And ya I signed up for coinbase too but after going on r/coinbase I decided to look elsewhere. Nearly every post is people’s stories of getting ripped off or ignored by coin space or just things going wrong in general. Now I’m sure that’s just the vocal 1% of unhappy users but it still made me a little wary
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:20:23
That is true, I am planning on doing long term. Also investing incrementally. Maybe a thousand today, and then more and more as the price dips here and there.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:05:44
^ yes I’d like to know too
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:12:13
Interesting. I’ve never heard this strategy explained but it does make sense. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:32:47
Oh well that sounds promising. I’ve been reading up on coinsquare now and they sound reliable, and maybe a bit more geared towards Canadians. I’m awaiting verification now so will see how it goes!
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:28:01
Hey awesome this looks like an informative read. Will check it out. And ya it was between quadrica and coinsquare for me, really a toss up I think I just liked the name coinsquare more haha
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:21:20
Thanks, a very informative video lol. Ok I will wait for one of these small dips and then pull the trigger on a small amount. Do all of you own hardware wallets or is it not really necessary in your opinion?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:39:25
Why do you say buy in slowly? I feel like it’s skyrocketing now and it might be a sooner the better scenario, no?
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:00:19
Ok thank you. Well I think I understand the gist.. I Think I will use an IOS wallet for the time being until my ledger nano s arrives and then transfer it over. This is all still levels beyond my comprehension. But I figure I can learn as I go right haha
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:21:34
Thanks, good advice
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:43:59
Thank you, very helpful. One other thing is, I do not have a hardware wallet this second, but I am thinknig of buying some today. Do you think it's an ok idea to buy it and store it in say an electrum wallet untill my ledger nano s arrives? I'm not super computer savvy so probably not going to encrypt and 2FA and all that..
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:37:35
Factors in favour of me:
- I just made this post so some people oughta listen to me right
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:32:14
This makes me feel humiliated for just getting in now..
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:38:25
When I finish building this time machine. Just gotta insert the crystals..
