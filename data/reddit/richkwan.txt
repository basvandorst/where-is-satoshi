Okcoin should pay the victim company 40%  of their lost through the bitcoin transfering on Okcoin.The company thinks it was okcoin's fault that it helped the criminal to do the money laundering.

Thanks for your post.The department of public relations in
Okcoin is really shit。Why were they keeping appealing after the first lose of lawsuit?Why didn‘t they pay money to the victim or get settle out of court?The judgement is online now and everyone can see it.How could they prevent the lawsuits in the future by Citing this case ?

Hmm,finally you come.But the judgement  is online now.How could you prevent the hidden losses?The court thinks you are running business out of scope,right?I'm really concern about any further measures taken by the CN gov.

Sure.it‘s okcoin.cn 。Not only OKcoin but also huobi and bter are involved in the case.But maybe okcoin did the worst thing,so it was suited.

Chinese can trade on .com site as long as they have passports.Many Chinese people dealing on the .com site because .com site provide a  20 times margin，while the cn site is at most 5 times.

Absoloutly!All Chinese banks  should get off from bitcoin exchangers,but the exchangers come up with an idea:use bank accounts of their employee and other companies and the Chinese traders transfer money to these accounts .When getting inquired,they would say people only transfer money to me to buy goods!Chinese Gov. regards bitcoin as goods!It doesn't ban goods dealing!But gathering so many accounts to receive money seems violating the current law in China.
