Then don't buy Bitcoin.

What do you mean...
@_date: 2018-09-14 19:00:48
I wanna believe just like everyone else, but people who have literal billions and their entire career invested in seeing crypto peak again are not good sources.

As long as it isn't deliberate it doesn't bother me. It's three people. It's perfectly possible that the event just happened to find three people they found qualified and who happened to agree and they just happened to be women.
It only starts bothering me when they advertise the gender as some sort of value/attraction or when they try to sell it as a statement ("look guys we are an all women panel come listen to our unique perspective theehee").

Another episode of "person/company with a personal interest in seeing BTC grow says it will grow, trust them"
@_date: 2018-09-28 10:28:56
Who cares. If you find a legitimate/credible BTC trader that allows users from your country just do it.
@_date: 2018-08-31 15:47:39
Well I do feel a lot better about the fact that there is a simple hack that is able to extract your passwords from the device knowing that the team of ethical hackers didn't actually use it to steal money :)

But he still has the BTC he mined. 
From what I remember he no longer mined but struck a deal with other miners to allocate effort to help them mine in return for a piece of the profit iirc.
@_date: 2018-08-30 17:55:02
Not to beat on the guy, but isn't he running a large mining operation? His opinion might be just a little injected with personal preference for growth.

I don't know what any of this means but I'm gonna agree with the first guy that says something smart sounding.
@_date: 2018-10-11 18:43:32
Yes that sound right. I agree with you.
@_date: 2018-10-24 08:52:31
Hey that's what I did!

Very poor writing. He insists it becomes "part of their identity" but the quote he links to that argument doesn't show that at all. It's just a guy who says he believes BTC will go up again because it's a technology that will become more important in time - and that that makes it worth holding on to a sinking investment.
I don't see how th author wants to argue that this man has made BTC a part of his identity because of that statement?

I'm not sure I want to pay 200-400k for a watch with a rubber/silicone strap.

Like Murray said: The UK government is doing all they can to nick Tommy on any charge they can make stick. They raided his house and his family several times until they found some morgage fraud.
Now they could without a doubt find some outstanding parking tickets or morgage fraud charges on most radicals or terrorist supporters or child grooming gangs, but for some reason, they can only muster that effort when it's to nick someone causing a ruckus and saying inconvenient things.

Too bad Hublot has some of the ugliest luxury watches in the world.
@_date: 2018-11-07 15:10:38
I can see some of the appeal. They have these niche watches like the ferrari one. A novelty. A great product of innovation and creative mechanical design, sure, even commendable that they try to reinvent the concept of what a watch can look like and how it can keep time, but at the end of the day they're just not visually pleasing.

Why would you send your money to someone you don't know?
Was it one of those "send me X amount of BTC and I will hack paypal/ebay/creditcards and send you more money in return" things?
@_date: 2018-12-29 14:31:16
Only more evidence that there is zero functionality to this question and it's just their sense of authority.
@_date: 2018-12-29 11:14:13
I think most people don't realize how careless they actually are with your money or more people would prefer to stash their earnings in a shoebox under their bed instead of trading it for a measly minor intrest rate.
I also doubt most people realize that banks only have to actually keep a percentage of your savings safe.
@_date: 2018-12-29 10:19:47
I hate how banks have the attitude that they are my authority and I need to submit onto my knees to be allowed to use my own money that I put in their hands so they can gamble it behind my back.
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:55:26
*Great script*? Need to hear nothing more. Just tell me how much you want!
@_date: 2018-12-29 12:23:42


Precautions could include "sir, I need you to prove your identity to know for certain that you are the owner of this account". Not "sir, I need you to explain what you need this amount of money for, until then we have blocked your account because you are withdrawing more than we can allow."
It's my money. I do with it as I please.
@_date: 2018-12-29 11:56:57
The contract being that they keep my money safe. Nowhere does it say "we are now your boss and you'll have to put up with us making you justify why you need one grand of your own money and what you're using it for". Are you guys really defendinf bankers in 2018? On a BTW sub?
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:41:34


I can't get over how often I see people on Reddit post "you probably think X and Y lol that's so dumb haha".
how about just don't make assumptions about people, and don't make up random stuff they never said?
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:54:32
"Worth 500 million" still comes to Reddit of all places for financial advice.
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:05:55
What a sick mentality to see banks as "trusted custodians" as if you are a child and they are your parent.
They need to keep my money safe, not to oversee or have any say on my spending.

He made like 70k in donations a month on top of his salary and TV appearances for the last years. He's a literal millionaire. If you're still sending him money after his two-thousand dollar rug you're a God damn idiot
