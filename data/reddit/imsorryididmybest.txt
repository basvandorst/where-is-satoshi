Andreas Antonopoulos also told people that Mt. Gox would not fail. I trusted him, and bought as many Gox BTC as I could (fucking myself).
People make mistakes. There is no reason to believe that Ver or Antonopoulos were lying, they were just expressing their beliefs.

You don't even know who it is that you're commenting on. Hint, that's a good sign you're brainwashed. That's Mark Karpeles.

So to split our coins, after the fork, can we just send each respective coin to two different addresses that we control, at the same time?
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:48:17
So does that mean we are getting another set of coins, similar to the bch fork? Or no? Thanks

Gold was fiat money too. See constitution which declares gold legal tender.
Fiat has nothing to do with or without intrinsic value. And no, miles rewards programs, dotz, and similar credits are not fiat currencies. Fiat currencies are those which a government has declared that you must use. That's what the word fiat means.

A malicious actor would have to be in control of the recipient address on one chain, right? He can only replay a transaction that was coming to him anyway?
So I'm in no danger if I send coins to myself after the fork. Nobody is going to pay a transaction fee to replay my transaction, and even if they did, I would still be the recipient?
What about [this article]( which says you can opt in to replay protection by sending a small amount to a certain address?

I draw dicks on all of my dollar bills. I've never had one not accepted. In theory, I might get turned down one day. In practice, my dick dollars are fungible.

But how do you get both 1x and 2x coins, and not just end up stuck with whatever coin wins?

So some users are going to get a bunch of money and others aren't? That sounds.. ridiculous.

If gold's value is subject to its industrial usefulness, then it does not "itself" have value. It has value in the context of industry, which means its value is by no means intrinsic.

I don't understand. Can you help me understand? Or point me in the right direction?
