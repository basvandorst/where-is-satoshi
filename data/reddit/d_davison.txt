You forgot this step in your original comment. Furthermore, what if the individual is paid in cash?


If you already have an account you don't necessarily need to set up another one. This one completely misses the point


Again requires you to already have an account


Branch for an online bank? Either way this is a step you previously haven't accounted for


My point with all this (which is obvious by what you listed) is that you left out quite a bit of rigamarole. Sure, this shouldn't be difficult for the average person, but why settle for less?

How are you getting funds into that online account?

That's not at all what the person you're replying to is saying. The point is fiat works for those who control it, and to a lesser extent those with a monopoly on force. This is what bitcoin *attempts* to improve 
I assume in your scenario you mean you put a down payment on a house in bitcoin and get a loan for the rest? Why would we even want bitcoin to *save* this person's home in the event they can't uphold their part of the deal? Its just money, not a social program.
