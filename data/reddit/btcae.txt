Someone can help me to setup a LN node on my Mac? I want to set it up for the mainnet, not testnet.

The problem is the spam, segwit is the solution for spamming.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:03:41
Nah! Propaganda are from other shitcoins! 
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:38:45
Next post I will do a tutorial 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:29:39
This is a post for most newbies that don’t know about segwit and they shall know about it. I don’t use Coinbase, Trezor for life. :)
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:31:38
I already did that. I’ll wait for an answer. Thanks :)
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:13:49
Why do you say that? :) 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:22:27
I don’t see the tears on this post, just a smiling face. :)
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:19:22
It is! 
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:19:46
That’s why people need to use segwit addresses and Coinbase start for once. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:17:25
Yup, that’s true! :|
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:28:31
Before was free, now it doesn’t. They charge you the network fee. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:32:01
You are right is my Mac issue, I couldn’t install it without using sudo also execute it. Now I’m testing Zap beta app. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:41:27
Excellent! Hahaha! 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:12:08
I prefer to hodl bitcoin, but I need that the biggest exchange of Bitcoin start implementing segwit for their users (clients), so they can pay lower fees, free the mempool and have fastest confirmations.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:04:58
You are paying to high, change your wallet, I payed 0.22 usd of fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:32:51
When they start using LN they will leave other crytos away.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:33:00
No, only 10% of the users use, segwit. Check this
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:52:19
What do you want to know? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:34:11
Because from August we have this upgrade on Bitcoin Network and only 15% of the people are using it to transact. The benefits are more security, low fees and much more. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:47:28
You can send from a bech32 address to 1 or 3 but now you can't receive from 1 or 3 addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:02:21
You need to use a wallet that supports segwit 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:46:53
What cold storage do you bought? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:51:20
Great! :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:10:58
Can’t you regulate the fee from your ledger? I think you can.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:24:25
Brilliant for adding it! Clap clap clap... that’s the big problem 
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:32:04
I have to answer you? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:10:59
Yes, coinbase don’t support segwit yet. Bitstamp, Hitbtc and I think Bitfinex supports segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:50:18
Mostly yes, that's why we need to start using it, check out Native bech32 addresses, are better than "3" segwit addresses. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:07:46
True, but nobody cares about BCash, Bitcoin has Segwit now, we need to start using it. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:37:33
I read that 3 addresses were adapted (hack) to be used in segwit, so every wallet can use it easily. Bech32 is the native segwit address, we need to start using 3 addresses to low fees and when bech32 be able in some wallets start using it and leave 3 addresses behind. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:39:00
bech32/BIP173/"native segwit"
Bech32 is a brand new address format that has a few advantages over the current address format:
Addresses are case-insensitive
Better error detection
More compact QR codes
Most importantly, bech32 segwit addresses enable native segwit transactions for Bitcoin. Those addresses always start with bc1.
However, since bech32 addresses are still quite new (the proposal is still in "Draft" state), most wallets, exchanges and payment providers do not support sending to those addresses yet.
What you can do with a wallet that uses these addresses:
send to any and all wallets, exchanges and websites
receive from other Electrum wallets version 3.0 or greater
What you cannot do with such a wallet:
receive from most other wallets and websites simply because they consider bech32 addresses as invalid.
To use these addresses, simply create a new wallet and choose "Segwit" as the seed type in the creation wizard.
This is the address type that hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger use. Addresses look like regular P2SH addresses, they start with 3. Without going into too much detail, this uses an old address type and uses segwit to spend from it. The advantage is that virtually all wallets already know how to send coins to this kind of address. One disadvantage is that to spend from those addresses, additional complexity is added to the transaction which makes those transactions slightly bigger (and thus more expensive) than native segwit transactions.
Electrum also supports this kind of addresses but you need to manually import a BIP39 seed with a BIP49 derivation path.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:08:25
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:14:35
LN on the mainnet, working perfect, I think that in 5 month we can use it, 0 fees, merchant can accept it. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:20:52
Excellent, go Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:31:20
I think this will help:
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:53:34
Excellent informative post! Congratulations! Go Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:54:37
I prefer Samourai Wallet for Android 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:41:44
What do you need to know? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:03:09
True, but it works with segwit, and security is good.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:18:45
Atomic swaps are smart contract you’ll can do it like you said, Bitcoin, Litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:52:32
Yes, you are right, for example I have to wait for my trezor to upgrade the web wallet so I can start using bech32, now with 1.6 firmware I have it inside the hardware but I can’t use it yet. I will wait until this upgrade. Electrum is the only wallet that has bech32 natively so we can start using it. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:20:42
Coinbase don’t support segwit already, you need to wait to January, I think they will support, my advice is don’t live your coins on exchanges put it your own wallet that supports segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:59:50
If you are only holding it, leave it there. When you get support of segwit move it. If not create one wallet on your phone, paper wallet or electrum wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:09:52
Bitcoin Core doesn’t has a default segwit address. You will need to learn how to convert through legacy address to segwit on the Console of Bitcoin Core Wallet. I try it ones but I never try it to send some coins to the new segwit address on Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:38:37
Wallets and exchanges are responsable to start using this tool. Trezor for example from day one segwit was activated you had a default segwit wallet. We need to start using the wallets that support segwit to low fees.

I still don’t understand the question, what do you want to buy? Bitcoin? 
What wallet? For segwit addresses, Pc or phone? 
Transfer what? 
EHG? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:41:52
Pfff... Chinese you say? Ha! Please dude I don’t see good post from you. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:18:32
Good advice, when I say "Use it" I never said spend it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:10:40
I accept Bitcoin in my store. :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:58:47
Only 10% of the people are using segwit addresses, if people start pump it to 80% the fees will go down drastically. If you only hold it, don’t worry. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:05:22
I can’t help you with that, search in ledger blog.

@_date: 2017-12-26 00:56:38
Your welcome!
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:45:43
Yup :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:55:04
Mmmm... I think keepkey don’t support segwit yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:15:47
Coffee with Bitcoin using LN, fees solution, ultra fast transactions, excellent solution for business. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:21:22
So what do you recommend to low fees? Continue using legacy addresses? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:53:56
Alibaba Nodes 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:51:22
Go Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:45:38
I think that at the beginning people will pay high fees to open a channel, but at the end not. You can’t say it’s unusable, yes, we have a congested network because spam. BTC is a p2p between nodes, and LN it’s also a p2p Network, you need a node to do transactions. Did you try it? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:59:39
That’s a good one! :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:53:06
First I suggest you wait until fees go down, then use a no web wallet, if you have the private keys you are safe. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:56:41
I assume that you are talking about Electrum Android Wallet, this Wallet don’t work with segwit, “bc1” isn’t a segwit address. GreenWallet and Samourai Wallet use segwit in android phones. Electrum+Segwit Only for PC version 3.0.3.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:54:29
Thanks! I want to help the noobs to understand the FUD but you explained better! :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:25:39
You know, here in my country is not easy to buy bitcoin, I want to make it easy to the people just that.   
The simplest solution that I found is through an BTM. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:48:35
Here you have a tutorial.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:10:22
Bitcoin is LN, you’ll transfer bitcoin through LN.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:58:30
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:00:32
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:10:31
Yes it’s start with 3
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:55:01
I totally agree! 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:01:23
Yes, works like that, you can send an receive from both addresses. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:22:05
Because they have more important stuff to do to the wallet and security of the network. The tool is there to use it, I’m concern too about this but, I think that’s the answer. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:58:45
Yes, maximum we reach 1.6MB, we need people stop using legacy address and start using segwit address, the fees will go down for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:53:19
LOL XD yes it’s sucks, I prefer to not use iOS wallets. I have a Trezor, if I had an Android I’ll be using Electrum or Samourai Wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:43:54
Great for him, he deserve it! He is a great human being. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:39:47
Legacy address start with "1", Segwit address start with "3". 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:56:47
That’s true, but you will open/close a channel ones a while so the mempool will be clean.  Cheap transaction onchain and offchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:26:53
Clap clap clap...
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:20:24
If we reach up 100% of the people using Segwit addresses, maybe we reach 4MB, remember we have a big mempool with lot of unconfirmed transactions. So, we will reach 4MB easily and with LN next year at the end the size of the blocks never gonna be full. :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:33:39
Yes that’s true, that’s why we need to teach new people to start using it. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:23:26
It’s not a company, it’s a protocol. Lightning Labs is helping to make it work like a lot of developers around the world. 
You will open a channel and you will do micro transactions until you’ll not need that channel you close it.
The congestion of the bitcoin network will be relieved with LN you will use the mainchain to do big transactions in fact, when you’ll open a channel won’t be with $10/BTC you’ll open a bigger transaction channel, and close it bigger. Inside LN you’ll use it to send a SAT if you want. I think this will be biiig. But if you are HODLING doesn’t mutter, this give value to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:00:02
My clothes store accept Bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:05:22
Store of value, for now, financial growth. LN convert Bitcoin into cash.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:37:26
This will help:
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:25:32
1) For windows or Linux you can use Electrum version 3.0.3.
2) Bitstamp, HitBTC use segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:23:30
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:31:38
I was reading that those addresses will be the next step for segwit, the most of the wallets don’t support already, electrum version 3.0.3 support it. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:45:50
Legacy address start with "1", Segwit address start with "3". 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:11:16
Really I didn’t know that, but why I don’t see it anywhere? The only wallet I saw it was in Electrum Android Wallet. I thought was something wrong. What’s the benefit? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:27:21
What misinformation are you talking about? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:29:13
Yes, you will pay fees for moving it. I suggest you wait until congestion stabilize and fees go down, then move your coins to a segwit address of a wallet of your choice. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:47:56
I’m glad to answer this question, but I don’t know. I think they are lazy, specially coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:59:16
Yup, we need to start with us first. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:57:28
Actually Trezor, Samourai Wallet, Bitstamp and Hitbtc use segwit with a 3 Wallet, in fact Jimmy Song explains in some Medium tutorial the difference of segwit/legacy and always refers Segwit as 3 Wallet. I think the next step is changing to bech32 address.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:50:26

@_date: 2018-03-27 21:38:40
They will be back using LN, don't worry. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:30:41
Almost nothing 
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:31:52
That’s why it’s proof of work, they have to take profit for protecting the network.

No, he is reading, he don’t answer because he is scared and rekt.
