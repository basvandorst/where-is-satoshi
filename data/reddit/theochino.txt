Very good article and what pisses me off Is that the Ulrich got mad and played the tug and asked for a murder after the agent stole the money. Ulrich would not have done it if the agent would not have stolen the loot.
I am not judging Silk Road but the repercussion of the secondary crime .... 
Such repercussions are like the DA of New York going after everything Bitcoin and Encryption. I am so mad at the Manhattan DA that I tweet about it : 
The whole thing pisses me off when bad apples appear.

The letter on a handwritten paper is not from a Lawyer but from a Local Bitcoin trader sitting in jail because the US government accuses him of being a Money Launderer. The only material he has is a Pen and a Paper. No computers. *      
        
If I am such a quack, why after presenting 11 times the content this happened ?  *(The guy preventing me to speak want to be judge, but he will have to answer for that video one day.)*      
          
They do take me very seriously in New York City ;)

Oh, that one ! :)   
Yes, it's an attachment to the email .... the goal of Twitter is to get the troops going. The Senator received that letter in July so he got the letters from my lawyer and from the Bitcoin foundation.        
          
The message is : "If a guy sitting in jail can send his opinion to the US judiciary, you in Nebraska can certainly do it locally."                   
Well, I hope you are not in a country that is taking the NY Bitlicense definition and slapping it in the code. I heard France is headed that way. The Philippines and the United Arab Emirate did take the NY definition. Everyone in government is lazy so if the definition works, why not copy it.

The bullet is the reason they used to keep him in jail and not grant bail. The reason they targeted him and then arrested him is for not having a FinCEN license (count 1 and 2 but dropped since.)            
           
After a 2 years investigation they tough they found the next Dead Pirate Roberts and when they did not find anything, they got mad.     
The government mixed his political speech and beliefs with money laundering.           
                      
You can read similar stories with James Wagner (Colorado - 2015),  Randall Lord (Louisiana - 2016),  or Sal Manzy (Maine - 2015) *[did not write his personal story.]*          
           
These documents on Count  the bullet, does tell the story:

-- US Government:

This is from the DA Report  : "Compliance with such a statute would not require new technology or costly adjustments. It would require, simply, that designers and makers of operating systems not design or build them to be impregnable to lawful governmental searches." (Page 13)
On January 2014, he said this to a hearing to Lawsky: 
"Therefore, it is my position that digital currency exchanges should be required to obtain licenses as money transmitters in order to do business in New York State, and therefore, come under this  regulatory framework"
My argument is that to protect "Full Disk Encryption", because as it's crypto we are protecting.

Those dudes by attacking "Full Disk Encryption" via the cover of Terrorism *(which was the topic of the first hearing on enacting the BitLicense in New York State)* will put a dent on Bitcoin.

I signed the open letter because I believe that there is nothing wrong with asking politely, but we need to need to show we have a heavy hammer in the hand.
When presenting this letter to Mr. Lawsky, one need armed and there are two thing these people understand; the election box and the court.
Other than that, it's wishful thinking. I have been playing this game for too long in New York City to know how it works.
What we need to ask is for the DFS to go back to the drawing board and start again.

I am fighting my own legal battle to destroy the Bitlicense, but like anything legal, one thing can affect the other. For example, Thomas is the first federal guy to fight back.              
                  
The real first one ever was Espinoza but that was only in State Court. Thomas, was the first one and the government let it go and only kept the Money Laundering charges.              
          
For the criminal charges, the state has a free lawyer which is what Thomas got. She did an amazing job once she understood what bitcoin was. She got the US gov by the balls.                 
                  
In a way, it was LocalBitcoin.com trial and it was deemed that LocalBitcoin.com is completely legal and they don't need to ask for anything. The folks at Localbitcoin instead of talking to me, just started requiring documentation from their user. The only thing they should write is : "If someone tells you they are using bitcoin for something illegal, walk away, don't do the trade."                 
               
Well, after that, Brad Stetkiw in Michigan saw his charges dropped, and we are waiting for NodeFather in California. Meanwhile Luis Ong got 20 days of jail time. They are offering 10 years to Thomas Costanzo for less than Louis Ong.
                
If we work together, we can defeat this bull shit. 
                       
I know they hear me loud and clear:

 (With NodeFather in San Diego)         
                  
Because at the end of Thomas' trial, we had a ruffle some feathers and they asked me about the picture.

This document is a hard document to draft because it's multi audiences but will serve as the foundation, or the manifesto *(when has a manifesto never being pompous ?)*:   
1. The Global Bitcoiner village that do not *know* *(big iphone typo)* anything about New York politics but that with a few clicks can discover that the regulator is not above the law (which law, that is the question.)  
2. To present myself and to "try" to present the indisputable fact that I am who I said I am. *(How many story of real famous real people wanting to change their profile on Wikipedia?)*  
  * I had to show that I :  
     went trough the Internet commercial infancy (without being Clifford Stoll)   
     was a participant building the commercial Internet (without being Wiston Cerf)   
     am not afraid of the court (without being a lawyer)   
     live and vote in New York State   
 
3. To the regulator himself *(whom you are correct in saying that it will be a staffer, but in the eye of the law, it doesn't matter who read it, it was written, and lady Justice who is indeed blind, doesn't like it when people come unprepared)*  
4. The "new" Columbia establishment that is bullying trough my neighborhood and my community. I am proud of their campus, and would definitively love a Honorary PhD for Pain in the Ass from their establishment; but first and foremost, I would like to appeal to their staff to join our cause and trough their network reach the regulator himself.  
5. The journalist, that is so pressed for time, that doesn't have the time anymore to do their due diligence. I don't have the time to run a full press office, I have to hit the pavement and talk in person to as many Hard Core Bitcoiner in New York City.

Well, that is where the tricky thing ... :)
If it's a ledger, and it's financial and Lawsky can regulate.
If it's an inventory system, it's an asset and Lawsky cannot regulate.
From Wiki Entries:




*I feel it's like an egg or chicken question*
The question is do you create the ledger from the inventory of where the satochi was, or do you keep track of the satochis by reading who you wrote it to.


The more I read the code and the definition of a ledger; it feel to me that it's an *inventory control system*; a ledger would record a negative value if you spend what you don't have.
An inventory control system will not let you send something you don't have.   
The wallet is not an *account* (in the accounting scene) but a *proof of ownership* within the inventory system.
The IRS might had it right but for the wrong reason ;)

- have the big one Foundation, Coinbase make the argument with properly hired advocates.

But after Draft come the real thing, so we need to start with a Draft of a lawsuit :)
@_date: 2014-07-24 13:27:32
Unfortunately, I don't have the muscle at this time to bankroll an Article 78.
I have a small Web Wallet operation in Harlem working with the small business community ... I incorporated in Delaware with Foreign Reg in NYS.
I kinda tried to stay under the radar until I fully understand the technology and understand the whole Bitcoin as a System Administrator (how to make it redundant proof.)
My professional jobs (the one that pay the bill), until recently, as a System Administrator, I was responsible for 2.5 millions devices running Java webservers; 
When I was first introduced to the Bitcoin network, I tough how it would revolutionize the world and I tough of remittances. 
When I compared the current technology of the banking system, which is technically Pull Technology and the Bitcoin one, which is Push Technology I realized that the challenges would be greater that first expected. 
I used to work for Cybersource, so I did learn quite a bit about Credit Card fraud; and also dealing with the banks when it comes to charge backs.
I can recognize that Ben Lawsky ran into the same pitfalls I did with this draft and at this moment he doesn't understand the ramifications. 
He also gave a free pass to the banks, and knowing a few system admins in those banks; I can see the day when someone will email by mistake the private key in an email.)
The realization I made is the litigation for the consumer to get the money back, and what happen if a payment made to a vendor is attached to an orphaned chain ? 
Those questions that are unanswered in the regulation because one need to understand the real role of the miner. If you want to fight Money Laundering, it need to happen at the law enforcement level and not the middle man.
There is a shift, and this could be a role for the NSA/FBI/CIA but Ben Lawsky as a regulator need to think a bit more.
I would personally prefer to run my business than mounting this Article 78, but I guess it's part of the business.

And for the last piece, I was branded crazy because I filed Pro-Se *(on my own)*. There is only 90 days to file a regulatory complaint on constitutional ground. 
                       
I talked to all the Bitcoin lawyers of the epoch but none of them wanted to take the case because they knew it had merit which would mean fighting against the potential of huge fees for them in the future.
               
Filing a piece of paper, albeit bad, meant I was extending the 90 days window until I could train a lawyer about what I believed bitcoin was. Pierre Ciric jumped into the fight when he saw that the State responded with 70 pages worth of paper. For him, it was a sign there was something.
                          
The only reason I harassed the journalists was to raise money to pay for Pierre. I started working with the Bitcoin Foundation. They did not have money but they started spreading the word.
                         
The moment that I took the money from my retirement fund, I stop really carrying about the journalists and all. I just help Lawyers with the resources of my website

She got elected the first MP for overseas France. I know her personally because we got introduced into politics about the same time. I was inside the first inner circle until they decided to play it safe; but I have seen elective politics from up close.
I do strongly believe that **"WE THE PEOPLE"** stand for something and Bitcoin has the hability to bring people from all walks of life together.
At this point of time, I believe 100% of Bitcoiners believe that these regulations as proposed by Mr. Lawsky are bad for the future of the Bitcoin.
What we might disagree is how to get there.

Reading some of the comments on these thread about the choice, it show that we are not willing to defend our Decentralized network.
The choice is either Run (relocate to Austin - Saw the nice website), or Fight. 
I personally learned to fight in Traffic Court in California. What amaze me is that the people go : "I made the left turn and ran the red light" and then are surprised when the judge says : "Guilty". The right answer is : "I wasn't driving the car so how could I run the red light making a left turn?"

I'll put his name in the lawyer bucket. Is he based out of Albany or NYC ?
My friend told me that Art 78 might need to be filed in Albany.
I read that the statute of limitation is 4 month from the day it is made official. So if we have 45 days to comment, how many day will it be enforced ?

The court have not rejected anything. I have until Nov 12 to write this thing up.
The argument are presented by the AAG telling the court that they have no jurisdiction. I need present the court an opposing view saying they have jurisdiction.
I registered my business a year ago well before the audition by the NYDFS when it was unregulated. Further, as a New York State business I was not invited to speak, only out of state Big Businesses were invited.
I need to dispute the point the AAG is making that the suit should be thrown out because I should have sued the State and not one entity of the state; I need to show that it doesn't matter because the department I am suing is actually implicitly the State of New York since NYDFS makes rules for the State Of New York.

why do you think I am asking for help.
 I would love to have lawyers do the thing so I could concentrate on my business.
 I agree with you on "What this is about" ... " not authorized to do."
However, take it upside down. The Bitcoin community is small and compare the Job  from the finance (vs) the job  from the bitcoin community.
The Bitcoin and the bitcoins are a disruptive technology that will have an impact on the finance. The banks are reacting the same way the music industry reacted in 2000.
How many bank jobs will disappear if Bitcoin becomes the financial network ?
 (There is a capchat), and search for Lawsky in the defendant box. *(there might be more but I need to find the names under which they are stored.)*
I followed your advised and contacted Marco Santori but he is not available.
For the lawyer, it's not with 0.1 BTC that I am going to get it; but with 200. So If you know someone, please ...
Third I typed something so I don't have a blank page; didn't you see the movie Finding Forrester ? So I typed that based on the 200.2 (m) : "Virtual Currency .... used solely within online gaming platforms with no market ..." To me that sound like Casinos.
And article 78 is about the Separation of Power *(and only about separation of power.)* since the Banking law that he uses were writen in the Law by the legislator.
Example, **Section 200.10**; we would have to consult with him when *Banks do not have to consult with the Superintendent to introduce a New Product.*

This is how New York politics works. He is going trough the motions.
Legally he has to ask for feedback, and

So he just let everyone ask for more time; but that won't change anything.

Because it's the state of New York. I could claim $1 or $1 billion, it's in some sort meaningless, but the court has to answer the complain, and the basic question of what is "bitcoin."
The whole point of the lawsuit, is to define Bitcoin the correct way.
@_date: 2014-10-28 21:43:43
That is a given .... 
I am not suing to get money; but you can't sue the state without Amount + Name.
Once the regulation comes down, I will start an Article 78 &amp; Article 30.
A judge has to define Bitcoin for what it is in order to say they don't have jurisdiction and there was no tort; but the discussion of what "Bitcoin Is" is the important part.
I would "love" for it to be defined as "Speech" or "Religion".
@_date: 2014-07-24 17:45:33
It would be a requirement to have for anyone holding CryptoCurrency that don't belong to the person holding it and if you are based in New York State. (If you a bank, you don't have to have one.)
Those of you outside NYState, it would not concern you too much but we know the NY DA has a tendency to overreach.

That would work perfectly for the Lawsuit writing section, but for the law portion, not so much since we are not changing the law.

I did not say I do not want regulation, but I want the right regulation.
What is written in the rules doesn't even address your concerns; all it is doing is letting the banks take over; and you know what that means ?
Furthermore, Bitcoin is decentralized, so you can wait quite a while for it to be decentralized.

Thanks, I was on the right path then. :) I did not read FIS yet (but just did)
I've been working on the crowdsourcing and a way to Reddit the whole in subsection. You can find the work here: 
While working on the subreddit, I got to read some of those articles (3), and I also checked the NYRCC;
I see Title 100 with 3 parts about nominations on some board (very short) ... so the Virtual Currency would be the next, Title 200.
Now that I spent the whole day reading, *and correct me if I am reading this wrong*, but this new Title 200, is a clear overstepping of his duties.
I read in FIS:


























Where in there it says that he is allowed to write :




Doesn't the the law says that he must investigate; but nowhere I could find where he tells how we shall keep a record.


Anyway, let get back to the beginning : 
Section 200.3: License ... 
§ 599-e of the banking law says how he shall give the license.
And the various article states which business will get a license.
How can he declare : 
** Unlicensed agents prohibited**. *Each Licensee is prohibited from conducting  any Virtual Currency Business Activity through an agent or agency arrangement when the agent is not a Licensee.*
@_date: 2014-07-27 18:01:13


I would tend to agree with you, but this is not just anybody that wrote those regulation; it's the guy that is supposed to protect the banks.
So, yes, business will grow elsewhere and when the NY banks decide to jump into it, they will be the one to decide and noone will be able to do anything. 
They will run the miners, they will run the Networks, and that will be the end of this decentralized concept.

I have to say Bravo !
Usually I tend to be wary when listening to those Senates committees but here, simply bravo Andreas !
I believe that NYDFS is an organization that understand exactly what it is; the sentence is title 200 that give a free pass to bank says it all.
I have listened to many of those committees, and this is one of the best one; 
The Canadian legislature is well informed and their goal seems that it is to protect the citizenry whereas the one from the NYDFS is protect the industry *(the NYS law is clear about the NYDFS; it is to protect the industry FIS 101a)*
Bravo !

Netizen cookie,
I understand your frustration against my kind (those proof of concept entrepreneur that don't have a penny in their name) but how would you feel if you are told that you must pack up ?
Now, New York is strategic, very strategic. why would the Zulu news in South Africa cared about the New York City subway strike a few years ago ? 
Not to sound pretentious (but I will unfortunately) is that New York City is a worldwide hub.
Thing don't start in New York City but they end up being the second hop before worldwide notice.
H1N1 virus, SARS virus, Pizza, Smoking ban, and I can show you a town of examples.
New York City is the gateway to the world .... If I, or my fellow New Yorkers don't step up, we leave the Bitcoin regulation to the new generation of Ivy League produced elitist.

I give you a precedent : The Soda Ban of New York City
Yes, the regulation doesn't exist and need to be finalized, but this is also politics where there are two sides. 
In this fight, I am on the side that these regulation, albeit full of Bitcoin terminology, were written by people that clearly doesn't really understand computer technology.

But since you don't seems to live in New York State:
**What can I do if I get a decision from a New York agency that I disagree with?**
If you disagree with an agency decision, you can appeal the decision to the New York courts.    
You can do so by bringing an “Article 78 Proceeding.”    
It is named after the section of New York law that sets out the rules for this kind of case: Article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules.
Most people ask us about this kind of case after they have received an unfavorable hearing decision in a case involving the Department of Social Services (DSS) or a housing authority. - See more at:

@_date: 2017-02-04 02:00:18
Well, doesn't matter to me .... he runs his business as he want.    
It's either a BTC wallet and the user has complete control of the stuff or it doesn't. Can't be simpler.  
Here is the transaction I did while Bill was presenting his product:    
      
As I said, when I asked him about his wallet he said *(without checking my C/C++ developer credential)* that it was embedded in the P2P hash script. Even my lawyer who is not technical *( was incredulous. But if Abra's lawyers says it is ok, then more power to them.     
      
Since I am the one sending the BTC to my Abra account, the simple logic of the Edgeing can't be embedded and because the Bitcoins where taken without my say so, it show that the NYS BitLicense **does** apply to Abra.     
      
I like facts and not alt-facts.   
@_date: 2017-02-04 00:53:08
Yes it does .... when you click on the menu, it show you a properly formatted QR Code with a public address.     
CEO at BTCMiami told me that I controlled the private address and that is the reason they did not need to get a NY Bitlicense.       
I kind of became an expert on BitLicense because of this:      
Don't have anything against Bill but he can't lie in my face because he believe he is exempt. It is his business and he run it however he want; now I came and asked him because I tough he gave it some thought that he could share with me in regard of my action.     
@_date: 2017-02-01 22:46:58
Same here, and when I asked Bill in person at BTCMiami, in term of the New York Bitlicense and Edging, he explained that the value is inscribed on the blockchain. 
When I asked how it was possible he guarantee the abraUSD regardless, he said that I needed to learn the protocol and ran away.
I personally don't have a problem with the business model, but don't lie to my face about what is possible or not.
Explanations are required.

As a side story, a few years back, when I was a member of a Community Board in New York, the issue on the table was the reprimand to an employee of the board that used the phone to make a few long distance phone calls which came out to more than a few thousand dollars. 
As an inquiring member, I discovered that each call she made were charged about $3 a minute when the same call made with a Vonage phone would have been free.
I asked why we couldn't switch to Vonage as a Board and I was told that the city charter had a contract with Bell Atlantic couldn't use another provider. Talk about red tape ! 
So this city employee committed a theft of service and since it amounted to a big dollar amount, fell into another category.
Ben Lawsky has done what he needed to do legaly; and meeting with the community on Reddit, although a novel method, did what he was supposed to do.
This can been seen in this paragraph : "The NYDFS has demonstrated a willingness" 
This kind of embrace of the new technology bring great hope that we are part of the drafting of the society we live in, but when the regulation are drafted, all those who have great hopes realize suddenly that they were all back stabbed and develop resentment for politics.
As a political activist for more than 25 years, it sadden me because it perpetuate the belief that the small guy can't do it.
What they fail to realize, is that behavior is then passed on organization like FIFA ....
I will fight; alone but I am no Don Quixote. 
The challenge here is to be able to mount it in 160 days ! 
My experience is usually 2 to 4 years.

If I control the keys, why is the BTC I sent to my Abra wallet gone ? I clearly don't control the keys .... is it the Abra App that sent the BTC out or was it done from a central server ?
@_date: 2017-02-15 06:23:55
I don't know but many people have a vested interest that I don't succeed so they demonize the action with the hope I go away :) 
In front of the judge, neither NYDFS or myself have the upper hand, but lawyers making money advising clients because the regulation exists don't have incentives in defeating it. *(I can understand that)*

Hopefully the judge will come to the same decision has the Florida judge and say it's not money; this should also help in California against AB1326.   
To listen Oral Arguments on the Status of the Bitlicense 3/16/2017 on need to show up at court @ 8:30 am    
**     
     
Also, if people are tipping; I would love some tips to continue and take the bitlicense all the way to the supreme court: 1EW7ESwvS3yGesSbP8G5ULsHYmy5pykeCG    
       
Hope to you can spread the word.     
Keep the fight !!!! Hopefully we can get to fight at the assembly level.

The second part is the Nevada hearing, Coinbase opposed the ULC bitlicense.  
You are right, they have one and they will not oppose the bill if it is amended to remove the securities suplemental on the bill.  
The thing is that politicians don't know our internal infighting, so if Coinbase is saying that they oppose the bill, then we need to surf on it.

When is the Senate supposed to look at that ?
And just looked at this definition:
Just looked at this :
XXVII.  “Virtual currency” means a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded and functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value but does not have legal tender status as recognized by the United States government.
We are technically fighting that definition ; we'll hopefully have a new one.

He might have been pointing to Europe just to establish his credibility.   
     
In the court room, only the laws of New York matter; but in NY and in EU, an assessment is needed and he is saying that he has the experience of doing it and therefore I can tell you that NY did not do it as per the NY law.

Calderon won’t get very far if we put pressure. 
When ULC voted the document in San Diego two years ago I asked various group. You were on the board of Bitcoin foundation then? 
We need to expose Kraken and Gemini because they are the one driving the license.
Coinbase is against as long as UCC code 8 is included. If they remove the supplemental they will be ok

I started Pro-Se but along the way I found a lawyer that was willing to help me.      
    
        
I decided instead of trying to put my last $8000 in the project to get the Bitlicense *(which I knew I would never get)* and to give him the money and fight.      
     
I knew him because we always met at French consulate events. I worked hard to get a politician elected and he went to the French Supreme court to get her invalidated.

When a NYC resident buy a bitcoin, $100 is like for the rest of the world $1 ...

It's about value and what you can afford to lose.
For  example, I, in New York can afford to lose $100 and it won't affect me.  Someone in Zimbabwe can afford to lose $5 and that won't affect them.
If only those that can afford to lose $5 play, then the total amount in the pool will stay low, hence the low bitcoin print.
If  you bring the high player in the pool that can afford to lose $100,  then the pool will become bigger and the price of bitcoin will start  climbing as people in the place that can afford to lose $100 will start  looking for bitcoins.
New York City is that place, hence without NYC playing, then the pool will always be small.

You are correct, we need to be vigilant but the bill as it was voted in San Diego is dead. That was the NYS Bitlicense with some caveat.

No personal letter, no note, and no contraband. The problem with lawyers once you go to appeal is that they are expensive and when it comes to bitcoin, very much impossible to find.

Then I have to take it to court: 
     
But sometimes I go to City Council and testify:  and the NYPD doesn't like it: 
      
This is how we got the whole County of New York legislator to sign into it: 
      
So, if you don't want this to happen to the BitLicense (because the one that Barry support) is the New York one with a few thing that can disappear. (reason why at Def Con I jumped on EFF:       
        
So you can do like what happened in Florida where Crypto was criminalized in 2 minutes.

**And we MUST disagree on many points**, I don't claim to have some universal knowledge; but one thing that there should not be any disagreement is that we must fight is this new version of the Bitlicense. *      
    
Whe the Bitcoin Foundation published this letter,  Coincenter went on overdrive to get this letter:  *(Which include Barry's signature.)*
     
So I say the same thing to anyone that don't support the repeal, abolition or destruction of any form of restrictive BitLicense. I will say what I told Carol Van Cleef, partner at BakerHostetler when she asked me whether I knew why Lawsky left: "I don't know and I don't care." 
     
The only bitlicense I will agree to is simply the Pasting of the Notice: **"Buy and Use at your own risk."**
      
What drives me nuts is that Morpheus and I are the two people able to destroy this and the monetary support of the community as being minimum.     
People like Barry, Roger, Andreas, and the other legends could bankroll this thing so I could concentrate in winning the case and help Morpheus (and anyone the FBI targets win their case.)

**d.** In order for a user to acquire bitcoins, they must be sent to the user's Bitcoin address. This address is an alphanumeric string whose use is somewhat analogous to a bank account number.

**c.** To acquire bitcoins without mining, a user typically purchases them from a Bitcoin exchanger. Bitcoin exchangers typically accept payments of fiat currency (currency which derives its value from government regulation or law), or other convertible virtual currencies. A user will normally send or provide payment in the form of fiat or other convertible virtual currency to an exchanger, usually via wire or ACH, for the corresponding number of bitcoins based on a floating exchange rate. The exchanger, often for a commission, will attempt to broker the purchase with another user on the exchange that is trying to sell bitcoins.

**a.** Bitcoin is a virtual currency, existing entirely on the Internet and not in any physical form. The currency is not issued by any government, bank, or company, but rather is generated and controlled automatically through computer software operation on a
decentralized, "peer-to-peer" (2) network. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on the "block chain." The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be
verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography.         
    
               
(2) Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a decentralized communications model in which each party has the same capabilities and either party can initiate a communication session. Unlike the client/server model, in which the client makes a service request and the server fulfills the request, the P2P network model allows each node to function
as both a client and server.

**b.** Bitcoin mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the block chain, and also the means through which new bitcoins are released.

**d.** Maintaining an effective AML program also requires implementing effective means of verifying customer identities. See 31 C.F.R. § 1022.210 (d) (i) (A).

To get the attention of an effective troller, the trolled must ask the help of the whole community to tell the troller he was wrong about his certitudes.
Did you listen to the radio show ? I doubt that he will go against two lawyers saying that the lawsuit against the BitLicense is frivolous.
Defeating the Bitlicense is important to all; including him. He seems to have a skill set I lack, working videos. You can see how much I suck at it:

The cases come back because they are the Bitcoin Reference cases. 
Espinosa's logic is the first State case and it has not been tested in the court at the Federal Level.  The federal case to invalidate is the Faeilla case (which is the Charlie Sherm case) and that was to be done by the Richard Petix case. Now we are waiting for MorpheusTitatinia *(next week in Phoenix)*, SaltNPepper *(next month in Detroit)* or NodeFather *(today in San Diego.)*            
            
The state of Florida invalidated the Espinoza decision in 9 minutes:         
What I try to advocate is that people actually start getting involved in the process, because when they do, this is what happens:                   
Right now, what is needed is people to contact their federal congressman or senator and explain to them why it's important for Crypto that they ask the GAO to launch an investigation on the DOJ on why they are targeting bitcoiners.                 
            
This is me in New York explaining that bitcoin are intangible bananas, or Intangible Commodities. The **executive** branch of the federal government CANNOT call the same thing many thing because it suit them for enforcement purposes. That is the job of the **legislative** branch.

My Libertarian friend morpheus (sitting in jail) wrote this manifesto explaining why they are Intangible Commodities. 
                
This guy in 2013 wrote: Synthetic Commodity Money:                    
                  
This guys wrote : "it    finds    that    Bitcoin    cannot    be    classified    as    money    but    remains    a    medium    of
exchange    that    the    market    may    choose    to    adopt    at    a    later    stage.   "

@_date: 2018-03-05 21:33:16
Did you get the long answer below with the link to the briefs on 18USC1960? The Coincenter document doesn't consider the **"Bitcoin is not money"** argument.      
Given the climate, if there were no agenda, shouldn't that have been considered ?
@_date: 2019-01-19 18:40:32
I agree 100%. 
I am a technologist and not a marketing guy. I have the gravitas of Quasimodo.  
If you can help to explain that in other words, share it, make noise, etc ... by all mean, let me know what I need to do and I will do it.  
I leave it to each to fight in their jurisdiction. They manage to do it in Nebraska. It was a beautiful 3 hours debate. [ You can hear the question here: [ (And you can hear the male senator say we had a testimony yesterday at timestamp 1:20:09.)  
So if you have idea how to make the better online "marketing", I take your help.

I was trying to find the episode but there is one of those US Custom show where the DHS guy says: "I know that it's synthetic K2 but the molecule is not banned therefore we need to let it in."
              
This is just FUD from our politicians that are trying to get around the whole debate. I have been trying to debate Cyrus Vance Jr. but he keep running away.

I don't know, read some of the documents; but Espinoza they picked him out of a hat because some USPS postal inspector wrote a report that Bitcoin is ONLY used for drugs.              
                 
Because of that USPS report, the FBI targets you just because you are selling bitcoin because it is related to drugs.

Anyway, it's for the hawaiian bitcoiners to show up. All I am doing is the notification ... What state are you in ?
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:15:12
I would like to talk to this person and ask his opinion: 
                
Now, you and I seems to have a difference of opinion on what it is: You can watch my testimony at the New York Senate:
                 
                   




               
This is a regulator from France: 
             
Now as a miner, you incentive is that the price goes up, and this regulation will make Crypto not to be used (like in New York) so your earning will go down to zero.                
           
**I don't believe that Crypto is Money so we already have a major disagreement.**                
               
Out of curiosity, what State are you in so I can direct you toward that legislature ? My goal is to have a discourse, and your view is as important as mine and it need to be heard.

The dude comes down like a hammer criticizing the language; so if he can't read between the lines, he can take a pen and start helping.           
             
I am open to all the criticism as long as **it is constructive.** *(What I call constructive is : this paragraph look like shit, here is how I would have written it. - Some dude on youtube did that and I changed it to what he wrote since it was better than mine.)*
                  
I personally has been fighting my own fight in New York:  *(and all the money goes for a lawyer)* so I am not very kind on people just writing shit just for writing shit.              
              
Everyone is free to do whatever, but when a lawyer is faced to defend a client on bitcoin, they are very grateful to the information on the website because it points them to actual cases that they can use: USA v XYZ .... some are PR stunts by DOJ like USA vs Shahnaz (terrorism) or USA vs Vallerius (supposedly the new DPR.)
              
If you want to help run my site, you can help.                   
                
The help I need is for bitcoiner is to call their lawmaker and ask them to have **the GAO investigate the DOJ** 
The bitcoin foundation is asking but we need a member of congress to actually do it: **             
           
I was about to ask it to Carolyn Maloney *(I brought my camera to the meeting, put my PR jacket and went ready to ask the question )* when on a question on Russian Hacking she said this:  so there was no point asking her.
                 
There is a lot to be done .... 
@_date: 2019-01-26 05:33:03
It got downvoted so quickly .... When I post on reddit is for the timestamp. Then I get people to read it by providing them the link. 
The reason for the timestamp is that they can't say later that I was faking it.
@_date: 2019-01-18 08:08:39
So the version I propose at the bottom is better ?
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:39:26
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:36:01
Because they are .... Just read the section on 
                       
The reason I started documenting is because *(at least in the United States)*, legal precedent can invalidate laws; so everything criminal can have an incidence on legislatures.
                      
Once I started looking at a few cases I realized a pattern was emerging where bitcoiners were targeted in a very systematic fashion following the same pattern.           
            
The pattern in question followed the NYDFS panel where Law Enforcement testified in 2014.             
               
Digging and reading trough the files, I realized that it was bogus and that the Department of Justice was lying in accusing the people and that many lawyers did not know what to do: 
           
So yes, people get arrested for no reasons at all other than trade bitcoins.             
               
Being arrested might look fun from the outside, but being alone in a gigantic room and not knowing what is going to happen can be scary as hell. The goal is that if that happens to anyone, to let me know so we can help by teaching the lawyers what this is really about.
@_date: 2019-01-25 22:52:25
The definition of what New York call it is the definition of what the world call it. Bitcoin cannot be regulated but if it has the wrong definition, it will let the countries arrest you arbitrarily.   
It's time the bitcoin world realize it.

Actually, you can go to  and follow the link.     
           
All the documents are here:          
           
But instead of fighting that Bitcoin is not money the government dropped the charges - document  signed by judge.     
        
The judge dropped the ammunition charge - document  which was argued in document        
         
So now the government need to prove that he was doing money laundering.
            
Let me know what story the court documents back up .....
He is a felon only because he was caught with marijuana a few years back ..... and the ammunition was a box of 60 bullets.

@_date: 2019-01-19 22:07:27
Thanks for the reply. 
Yes, AOC is spectacular and I smile a bit when you say that.
What you write is 100% accurate but for the video it was a message to Doug Polk when he started his channel about Crypto Currency. I wanted to give him my opinion on it based. I believe the video is actually hidden and I use it to tell my story. 
The reason I start with Derose is because Doug was quoting him a lot so I wanted him to realize that he did not know what he was talking about but that 100,000 followers believed.
You are right, maybe I should spend time redoing the video from scratch.
The problem is that the media like this kind of shit. 
What part of the country are you? I am trying to find people to help with  ... I try to keep track of a lot best I can. D/M me.
@_date: 2019-01-13 17:51:37
Thanks. I need publicity around the web so it can jump into mainstream.

We are not lawyers but just bitcoiners tracking down the information. And trying to explain lawmakers that "Bitcoiners are not crooks."

if you know how to read C++ you would understand that it’s not anonymous, but the FBI in it’s grand wisdom took the word of criminals and perpetuated the belief that it was.

The whole outlandish story is just that; legally it is for the government to prove all that shit. 
In term of raising money, I can’t do it because I suck at that :) being trying to raise money for my own lawyer very unsuccessfully.
Regardless of what he says, he still need our unconditional  support in the face of these charges.
Now, as I human, do I believe he should have the right to transport Marijuana across state and smoke to his heart content ? absolutely ! So the law is stupid ... and we need to change the law (which I am working on it.)
As a Bitcoiner, do I support using bitcoin for privacy; well, I do to .... 
so government is taking advantage of Bitcoiners to turn them into criminals and I will hold the government to prove that those guys are criminals.
Just me
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:52:20
2. Reason two is that the correct answer would be : **Don't do bitcoin**              
             
I don't know if you saw all the SEC subpoenas going on ? Even the lawyers don't know :)
             
So it's do it at you own risk and the best thing you can do is join me in creating a community to fight back.

To win those case, we need to document .... and that is the goal of  but these cases won't win themselves in a vacuum.

Well, the tide has changed in the last year since I jumped on the stage of the Miami Bitcoin Conference. That is why I am posting the message above, if you get arrested at least let me know.              
                
I have been working with Public Defendant lawyers *(some have been welcoming of my information, other less)* but since I started the tide has turned. The fact that lawyers discover that there are other cases in the US and that they are clearly catalogued *(Lexus Nexus is not up to date yet)* helps them.
                                     
At the same time, it help to know bitcoiners that they are not alone if they get unjustly caught.                
                 
Every time I hear the same story. Bitcoiner get contacted on LocalBitcoin, Bitcoiner exchange the bitcoin and the money, Informant tell them it's for something illegal after the exchange, and DOJ jump on them without them knowing why.
                
The only one that kicked the informant out of his house once the informant told him was Peter Steinmetz but still got arrested.                   
                
It's a never ending game.

The memo is sealed with the Burton case:                      
           
And side note, Klein *(who wrote the document above)* is who represented Wagner so he know about the existence of the memo.
              
You know the beauty of being semi retired at 45 and broke ? I can be as crazy as I want ! 
            
This is what happens when a crazy person testify:  -- By the end of the meeting they all agree with me that the bitlicense need to go :)
@_date: 2019-01-18 08:38:44
Thanks ... you picked up on the dual Japanese/Chinese. 
I take the Japanese which is not a transliteration would not work for the Chinese population. 
That is why the bitcoiners we are the best. I think I will leave the name as proposed by the translators then. Thanks

@_date: 2018-02-28 08:33:18
Well, the DOJ is the one crying about it every change it get.
       
   
I would make a medley of each legislator I hear repeating the same thing as Cyrus Vance Jr. has been saying in the last 6 years when he createsd his Cyber Crime lab.

The help is to use that opportunity to talk about bitcoin locally to your local press in a good light and slam the New York State bitlicense has hard as you can and explain how it affects you wherever you are and drop my name in the process. That gets on the AP wire and can be picked up here.
This is Nebraska where she slams NYState: 
That is the support I need.

I love how you follow the word of the government like the don't lie.

Technically it's the PACER system for the bitcoins lawyers (and journalists) to follow the Bitcoin case out of Arizona.     
I have been writing up stuff on this case and posting it here:            
            
But because the layers are prepping the case as we go along very fast, I linked to the raw documents themselves.       
           
For example, document  is the Voir Dire which is the questions that the judge will give the prospective jurors to answer.

I remember a dude called Espinoza, and they told him about the credit card **AFTER** the exchange was completed.     
That NODEFather is a bit flacky that doesn't make him culpable of a crime if he was setup. Now the government lost his credibility the moment that they keep pushing forward to make bitcoin illegal without justification. I have been posting all my finding on this website:

I can't because:     
**1.** I am not a lawyer so they could turn back toward me and I would get in trouble.
             
The second reason that it's impossible .... In my own lawsuit, I had to file pro-se because I could not find a single lawyer to represent me.               
                  
Before they decide if they want to take my case they needed to learn what bitcoin is and at the time they declined because they did not see as a winning case.             
            
There was a 90 days window to challenge the regulation and with no lawyer I wrote something which gave another 9 month to educate a lawyer. It took that lawyer 2 years to get to par. In my lawsuit I forgot to explain why I had the right to sue. *(Usually in prose cases, the judge will be lenient and figure out on the spot.)* In my case, the lawyer fixed the issue but my judge was changed to a new judge that did not realize that I started the case prose and came on us like a town of brick.


           
So now I am in Appeal on whether I had the right to sue .... **which is pretty stupid.**

Actually, US fiat money did it in the case of my cousin .... he did not deal with bitcoins.

In term of locals bitcoiners, I have notified the one in the meetups but I am trying to reach those that don't go to meetups but still feel passionate.
                  
                
I never went to a meetup before the NY Bitlicense was debated. So I know that there are people that could be influential but are not know.
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:35:46
It's a first step; I personally appears at minute 46 and represented the small business community. 
This is the list of participants.                
     
Missing at the table was Haley Robinson, and who left after I came to the table, Gilles Gade.
This is how CoinDesk reported the meeting:        
Now, his is New York politics, so if the courts were to invalidate the bitlicense ( then those guys would do like the rest of the country and start a real debate.       
All the hearing on the topic from around the country, the best one is Nebraska.

His parents gave him the money to buy DOS from Tim Patterson and his mother who sat on the same non profit as IBM CEO got him a private meeting with IBM CEO.
            
That is why he is a lucky prick ...

And I forgot, but I believe that bitcoin is an **intangible commodity**.             
             
After I asked the question to Thierry Philipponnat, an esteemed economist; he has his own wikipedia entry, Judge Rakoff brushed me off by saying : **"You are not a lawyer ... so you don't understand my decision."**              
                 
What I tried to tell him is I did read all the transcripts on how he came to the decision *(it's metaphysical he said in his courtroom)* and took the webster dictionary entry.
             
I emailed webster and they implied that Rakoff was wrong in his decision.

Depend; he said he will fight .... 
                 
But the **two cases** that are really important are:           
              
 - The government dropped the charge of 18US1960 (doing business without a license) leaving the Money Laundering charge (x5) *[March 14, 2018]*                
                           
 - The government is charging him with 18US1960 but no other crime. *[Sometimes in April 2018]*
          
Morgan is good for raising awareness to these cases. We'll know tomorrow what they are charging him.

And the whole discussion take a turn for the metaphysical:
             
You can read Charlie Schreem plea: Page 13 - He accept that Bitcoin is money to save his skin. 
             
I asked Rakoff about it last year ... and I setup the question by prefacing this: 
        
If you look under the hood, bitcoin is a technology but it is not money.
They even add issues since they needed to look it up in a dictionary.            
And they got it wrong because I actually asked Miriam Webster about the intricacies of the definition.

You are 100% correct, that case ended up in State Court and Espinoza won (the case is in appeal right now.) Espinoza is safe but the next guy not so much since the law was changed since.
         
The State of Florida got so pissed that they changed the law in 3 minutes flat:             
*(Watch the YouTube video, don't take my word. It's surreal)*
         
Had 1 bitcoiner showed up, there would have been a debate but if you listen carefully, everyone waived in support of the law change.     
         
The federal government is now considering a similar change (section 13):           
      
The transcript I put there is the transcript between a Doctor (MD/PhD) and the agent; a Russian guy.
      
For Morpheus, we started a Facebook page: 
So, yes the guy in Florida won, but it's not until we push back to elected officials, until then Law Enforcement will be the only saying we are all criminals to the law makers.    
We need to push back, and being an AssHole  is what it takes to get the attention of those people. Look who I am going after:  (That is me asking Cyrus Vance. Jr about Encryption.)

Without the help of the Computer community, the politicians will never understand. Most of them are Lawyers, and lawyer try to figure out fuck up way to reach an outcome. 
        
In an adversarial system, jurors composed of regular folks use common cense to make it work. Lawyer just present their vision of the fact.
        
Benjamin Lawksy was the judge, the jury and the executioner and this is why we are in the fuck up dilema we are in. During the 2014 hearing, the only economist that was there said: It's a Commodity.
        
The Bitcoin community chastised him calling him [Professor Butcoin]( Everyone is scare of the Bitcoin community, even Nobel Price [Paul Krugman wrote about it]( to the point [I need to ask the court to bring him in shackles]( !        
        
Sitting next to to the judge that put Charlie Shrem in jail, Jed Rakoff, is another economic professor from France and [to the question he answered: "it's not a currency, sorry"](        
       
The guy that run the definition of Bitcoin on Wikipedia is gun-ho in saying it's a currency. [I have presented him all the facts that I present everyone]( He keep wanting to read by journalist in the newspaper instead of academician in trade papers.       
                
That definition is what is entered in evidence in court as the truth. You can see that in my own trial against the bitlicense.       
        
I need help explaining people that it's an **Intangible Commodity** *(and Morpheus is sitting in jail the same way Espinoza is sitting in jail.)*

The memo is sealed .... I have been trying to get it from the longest of time.                
                  
These NYU people put out this report last year and none of them wanted to talk to me on the phone: 
             
But one source was based on an Interpol report that pointed to lobbyist firm that pointed to a marketing firm. 
I found back in 2016 the Unifab report below has been cited as the reason in an Interpol Report (that I can't find right now) to a CBP report that is linked to the document above.
(Source 


links between terrorist organizations and bitcoin. “It is in a PDF file posted on a blog that the man, ho calls himself Amreeki, explains how the bitcoin is the ideal way to finance the Islamic war. And  most  worrying  is  that  his  arguments  are  perfectly  consistent.  As  he  pointed  out,  bitcoin  transactions  are  anonymous and it suffices to have just a little knowledge of  cryptology  to  even  make  them  untraceable.  This  is  enough to enable everyone to finance terrorist groups in 
all impunity” 
The problem with that source is that the translation from English to France changed the meening of a Conditional verb (would/could) to a present verb **(was able to relate)**             
            
I can start looking for the missing documents in Web Archive but that will require more time.
Why should I convince you that I am right .... will it help the community by you getting involved or will I waste time ?
               
The reason I ask is that all I am pointing you to are stuff I have handing under the finger, but I can dig only if there is a benefit.

I am fighting two power, inertia and the big *bitcoin* players that are cosying up with the media in making sure my stories don't get out. They only report on my stories only when they have really have to and can't hide it anymore. It took coindesk two years to write the first story about it:                                   
              
It was not a real problem as long Andreas, Roger Ver, Charlie Shrem, and Company, were not really talking about it. It was an internal fight between me and the politicians. Now Andreas is suggesting that people don't do anything:  (Bitcoin Q&amp;A: Criminalization of ownership?) while politicians are clearly going after it:               
                 
This is how many people showed up for the  protest in New York state before the Bitlicense hearing at the NY Senate.                   
                   
At least in Nebraska, the bitcoiners gave the the lawmakers a show to remember  because in Florida, noone showed up and was passed in 9 minutes flat  *(3 minutes video)*              
                   
This is what happened in New York:  and I need folks to follow me so the politicians understand that people care about this issue. (I invited myself at the New York hearing because they did not invite me. Minute 45.)

And you are willing to help Bitcoin get regulated around the world on the account I am an asshole or that I am wrong  ?          
             
Read this document, it's the transcript of a Special IRS Agent and a Bitcoiner in Arizona. So we either start referring to it as "Intangible Commodity" or we are doomed.

 (full video: 
The choice of showing up and checking it out is up to the individual. Right now I am alone in this fight.    
People have to stop talking about Bitcoin as a **currency** but a **commodity**.    
What makes a currency is that there is a central power that controls whether is as a value and it's ability to defend it's value (ability to wage war against those who abuse it and can render it value to zero by sheer will.)
People confuse Bitcoin as a currency because of the ease to split it or transfer it from one person to another.

Bitcoin is made for small business, and rules for small business is pretty strict in New York. The constitution of New York is very clear on the process to follow in order to create regulation that affect Small Businesses.
        
Everything is somewhat explained here:     
              
If you want to watch a debate from Lawmakers in Nebraska, you will see that New York State blew it.                    
           
            
You can also watch this one in New York: 
               
And compare it to these one in 2013: 
            
**So no, the lawmakers in New York don't know more than I do ....     
But what it's interesting is when I tell you they are clueless, Reddit, instead of backing me up, they are backing the regulator ....** What give ?

And regarding the mother fucker running an exchange, it would have been nice for NYDFS to include small businesses to see what they wanted. Back then Coinbase was 7 people in a small room somewhere in San Francisco.                                                          
                    
You can see this hearing two month ago and at the end they all say that the Bitlicense is a piece of shit:  *(I was not invited but I but in at minute 46:00)*                     
@_date: 2016-10-06 22:11:34
In 2014, I just trying to get their attention so I could be invited to the discussion table. That did not happen; it was expected.
There is a small window of only 45 days where a citizen can appeal a regulation in NY State; the regulation took effect the week Lawsky stepped down from his post and the DFS lawyer in charge of the BitLicense went to work for itBit.
This created a knowledge vacuum and the the state kept asking me to postpone the deadline several time so the new people could get up to speed. 
That was a year ago. 
All the predictions about how devastating the regulation show it was true.
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:05:10
That is the purpose because I am annoyed as hell by the inertia of the community.      
           
I have been fighting the bitlicense for 3 years and nothing and suddenly Jesse from Kraken say he won't answer the letter and everyone is sucking his dick.               
                
The truth is that he will cave and answer the letter simply because NYDFS will go after each bank that has a relationship with Kraken. This will be like the Bitfinex lawsuit against Wells Fargo.
                  
You see I am used to that, the New York Daily News wrote:  but in their paper wrote "Get me Krugman! cries bitcoin kook"

Hey ! I am an New Yorker with a dose of French .... what do you thing I have? New York Post said I am a bitcoin kook, so what do I care what you think?            
        
However you can do your homework and then we talk, but to my knowledge, I am the only one with the lawsuit that can invalidate the bitlicense in New York.               
You are right, I am *not* important, **but my lawsuit is**.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:52:42
The regulation has been on the books since 2015 but when I went to talk to the self proclaimed "crypto lawyers" they all shun me as the crazy. They were all enamored with Charlie Shrem, the Winklevoss Brothers, etc ...                       
                  
Because the regulation was drafted in **"**secret**"** by the executive power, there is a provision that say that one can challenge within the first 90 days. I couldn't find a lawyer that would take the case. *What is bitcoin?* they would ask so I filed a lawsuit Pro-Se. Training a lawyer on what is bitcoin would have taken me over the 90 days limit.                                
                  
The judge did not give me the Pro-Se leeway allowance that is customary so we are in appeal on whether I had the right to sue. Yes, as Pro-Se, I did not know that I had to write it down *(I have a bitcoin business with 150 customers and here are the contracts.)*                 
                  
@_date: 2018-04-22 00:00:27
Not that simple. 
        
That question dates back from long time and according to his rules, I am considered a “bank in a garage” because I would hold the Bodegas Bitcoins for a little while.
       
From 2014 to 2015, I was working with about 150 bodegas for them to accept bitcoins. I designed the backend of the system they used.
      
This article in the New York Times came out the other day complaining that once can’t use bitcoin *(and blaming bitcoin for it)* and got a bit upset.
    


      
The reason there are no Bodegas is because of the Bitlicense, period. I got so piss led that I tweeted the journalist of the New York Times this picture:  or  
      
I am pushing hard because now that the NY AG is going after exchanges, everyone is saying “Bravo Kraken” for fighting back.
       
Well, I have simply to say that Kraken folks laugh at my face when I was handing out these flyers. As they were entering the hotel they looked at me smiling saying: “the Bitlicense cost me 100,000 dollars.”
       
This is the flyer: 
     
**I am not selling any ICO** or anything but simply the knowledge that there is a fight that has been going on and that folks should not forget it. 
      
The non profit CoinCenter is pushing bad regulation and because people don’t know I even exist don’t realize that folks are going to jail (google Morpheus or NodeFather.)
       
Bitcoin was not made to make billions of dollars, it was made for something else. If a few people can make money on it, good; but bitcoin is for small business and should remain decentralized. **That is what I am fighting for.**
         
The more people follow me on Twitter, donate to the legal fight in New York against the Bitlicense, get a membership with the bitcoin Foundation, the more chance are our interest protected.
        
This is what happened when people show up in Nebraska:

Joking aside, suing an entity in New York State is not only a justice issue but also a political issue.      
      
If no one knows about the lawsuit, the political aspect of the lawsuit takes a complete dive because the judge look at it as a non important thing.     
      
By having a big following by the rank and file bitcoiner indicate to the people that run the justice system that they can’t look at the case lightly, but also that they have a stake in the issue.
     
The message to the judge is very different if the room is empty or the room is full.
      
This is a David and Goliath story, and the Bitlicense allow a small number of player a monopoly, and those players are telling the political establishment that I am a small bump on the road that they should ignore. 
By having a big following, I am telling the political establishment that I am not a bump on the road.

You are 99.99% right in your comments ... but I don't think it's nobody cares about it; it's more that nobody really knows and understand the ramification of the problem.            
                 
Once you start explaining, you immediately turn into this crazy conspiracy nuts. It's a hard line to walk.
                    
Bellow is a clear example: 
                 
I have worked with many people on the field against the ULC Bitlicense you mention and once I tone down the message, they make waves.
When I tell you it's hard to understand, here is an example the ULC Bitlicense. On February 6 and 7 there were hearings.                     
- They put up the website  in a flash                 
- They went an testify (I don't have the video of that epic moment.)              
but if you watch the next day hearing on a bill that was created following the espinoza case             
-  (Watch 14 seconds) - Those bitcoiners knew nothing about the hearing going on.  They showed up.                     
-  (The real moment that she says take the bill off.)         
                               
And compare this to this hearing in Florida:   
- 
                
**How can someone not be overwhelm by the amount of material to follow ? **  
            
Regarding just listen to his own video:  *(he blocks me on twitter after he told me he did not want to get involved. He want public recognition so I lost faith.)*

Yes I am. Was at Concensus passing flyers and trying to talk to the press.
   
Well, the first salvo was to keep the door open until I could find a real lawyer ready to fight ! Not one of those compliance lawyer that tell you to fold.
   
So this Lawyer, Pierre Ciric, rewrote the whole complain *(you can see in Red what he did and in black what is left of what I did)*
    
    
We were supposed to go see the Judge on June 8 to ask them about submitting the new complaint but the State of New York accepted so we are moving forward. Next court date is the 31st of August.
     
Meanwhile I have been using this opportunity to work with EFF and create a new group with 2600 called NY Privacy Board Advocate (  and trolling the DA of Manhattan over 
      
Those from CoinCenter say they support me but I have not seeing a single letter of support; actually they are saying I don't have a chance.
     
I am lucky that my Advocate, Pierre, is actually an activist and saw that the State of New York actually was doing illegal thing.

That they overstepped they authority.
If Bitcoin is a commodity, then it's not a financial product and it is not for NYDFS to regulate therefore they overstepped their authority.
If it is a Financial Product, then because of Dodd Frank, it's for the federal gouvernement that need to regulate or give the State the right to regulate therefore they overstepped their authority.
Either way, they overstepped their authority.

I wrote a letter to the judge to explain:

If you understand what a wallet is *(I wrote this post with a picture of dices  then you realize that those transactions can take place over anywhere.      
A wallet is just a database of Private Key which is just a random number.      
  
    
@_date: 2018-04-20 19:42:00
lol ... couldn't find anything more tangible to explain it. Any street vendor can explain the fluctuation of bitcoin better than Wall Street :)
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:30:05
Tell me what is a wallet and then we can start talking about this. 
The language of Bitcoin uses Banking analogies so people can understand what a piece of Bitcoin is; but one you dive in the code itself, you realize that a private key is nothing more than a number from zero and very big (today 32 bits of storage but tomorrow can be 64 or 128.) 
      
That number is a Bitcoin; so how the definition as written applies to everything; and here lies the problem ... so you could be in breach of money laundering if you illegally copy music (Not that you would, right ?)
       
How do you regulate that ? **Why should that simple thing be regulated in the first place ?**    
     
Why should math be regulated ?      
        
And a wallet is nothing more than a ledger of private key. A wallet is a collection of Private Key with a pointer to a space in time.      
@_date: 2015-11-02 15:05:04

**Horseshit all around please !**
               
Regarding the statements made by Coin Center that the ULC model statute will prevent bitcoiners from going to jail: although it is unclear how a state which adopts the model statute interprets or meshes that new statute with its state money transmitter statute *(used in the Espinoza case in Florida)*, there is just no way for the model statute to **have any impact on any DOJ prosecution at the federal level** when the prosecutor uses the federal money transmitter statute to criminally charge the bitcoiners.  2 reasons for this, federal law has primacy over state law, and the DOJ uses prosecutorial discretion to charge anyone it wants based on its own goals, regardless of the state's goals.
               
Such a statement by CoinCenter, if confirmed, would be deceiving at best, unless it has a grand strategy to convince the DOJ to stop its current prosecutions. 
               
**I am all ears !!!!**
Another point, is that their donors do **Exchange, Store, or Transfer** so as long as you don't do that activity, the law they have pushed will prevent you to enter that business legally.

Again with the "putting down" verbiage .... and custodial/non custodial language is the one I hear only from a few groups, mostly lawyers. 
Maybe it is time you dive in the code and look at the fabrication process.
By calling it "Virtual Currency" you already made up your mind on the nature of it (doesn't matter the reason but you made your mind on what it is.) 
A discussion between you and me will be impossible because you are at level 10 while I am at level 1. 
It's not because you paid X for it that it is what you say. The jury is not yet out on what the nature of bitcoin is, so trying to make rules today it's like making rules for a flat earth.
The ULC definition will prevent any experimentation beyond the framework the ULC is trying to define.
Why is it so important to regulate businesses in the Bitcoin space at this time ?
Anyone who really understand Bitcoin/bitcoin doesn't refer to wallets; wallets don't exists; but it's the best imagery that exist to explain a noob what a storage of private key is. 
So writing laws for something that doesn't exist seems simply unnecessary, but once the law is written.

As for Coinbase, it's clear. They are protecting themselves from having other people compete against them; so they are protecting themselves from anyone playing on their turf.      
     
As for EFF, it beats me. They believe they are doing good but they are not on this one. When I called Jaime, she actually hand up the phone on me. I'll try to talk to the director at DefCon but the ULC meeting will have passed. If someone can explain to them why it's bad and idiotic, please go ahead.

Where do you see groveling ? Calling them and say "remove Bitcoin from the law" is not groveling but telling them ....
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:28:24
There are multiple parts; and it's guilt by association.
The way it work is very sneaky; first you add an entry in the law (any where), then you test that law in the court system.
Adding **Digital Currency** in any section of the the law is saying that we know what Digital Currency is; the problem is that we don't ! There are scholars that say it's a Currency while other are saying it's a Commodity. 
Until the debate of what it is is settled; it's premature to define as law. 
The purpose of the law it's to codify a set of behavior; however here, a group that know is wrong is trying to pull a fast one. There are some folks in Washington DC that are desperately trying to define as Currency. 
*Incidentally, the only that need that definition are the Winklevoss brothers. Other than them, noone gives a shit and even their filing has been amended to say it's a commodity.*
CoinCenter *(and the same folks before that were part of the Bitcoin Foundation)* have been pushing that narrative desperately.
Now, the FBI has been going after some folks on the premise that because they sell and buy bitcoins, they are some sort of criminal; sometimes it is true, sometimes it is false.
Should the place to be where people buy bitcoin should be regulated ? That is to be debated, but by adding that little sentence in that section of the statute, the debate can't take place.

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that Defendant Charles Shrem (“Shrem”), by and through his undersigned counsel, Baker Marquart LLP, respectfully seeks an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs associated with his successful opposition to Winklevoss Capital Fund, LLC ’s (“WCF’s”) motion for confirmation of the prejudgment attachment. On November 14, 2018, the Court held a telephonic conference with counsel and ordered Shrem to file his motion for attorneys’ fees and costs by December 21, 2018. During that same conference, the Court stated that WCF’s deadline to submit opposition papers, if any, is January 4, 2018.  Shrem’stime to submit reply papers, if any, is January11, 2018.  The Court will not hear oral argument on the matter. 
WHEREFORE, Shrem respectfully requests that the Court enter an order granting the relief requested herein, and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

The only ones that want recognition are the Winklevoss brothers for their ETF and they fuck up the entire Bitcoin because of it. 
People are being investigated just because they buy and sell bitcoins. Bitcoin is actually the first Internet commodity ever created; so trying to make it a currency is ludicrous.

It's not about opposing everything but it need to be consistent; and consistent it is not. Let Academia study it and then we'll advise.
**What do you know about U.C.C. ARTICLE 8 ?**    
The regulation takes the barrier of entry very high, and making Virtual Currency a security (it's a way to run around the money issue *(because the states can't regulate it ..)*)
But for example if the UCC Article 8 get applied, and it's regulated like a security, then start brushing up on your brokerage license.
Another inconsistency, Fincen is part of the department of Treasury; and the IRS is part of the department of Treasury; so the department of Treasury considers it Money and Commodity at the same time. Is that possible ?

This message is for those folks that helped nudge the gov of New York to sign the creation of a Task Force to study Crypto. (I don’t know who they are.)
It has nothing to do with Bitcoin is it is not Currency. 
The currency debate is taking place in a court in San Diego (it was supposed to happen in Brooklyn but the guy pleaded guilty so there is no really binding decision to send to appeal) and an appeal court in Arizona.

Those working base of this this document is the New York State BitLicense and what they are doing is simply trying to band aid the NY Document into a state document. **In what state are you ?**
Only problem, Academia has not yet settled what Bitcoin is and NY regulators ignored the dissenting voice simply because it did not suit them. Now, they are trying to fix the rules on antiquated belief.
For example, are the transaction cheap today ? Because transactions are based on Satochis and Bytes, the belief that it is cheap was and is misleading and anyone in Academia could have explained that. It's simple math.
So the entire proposal itself is bad; the killer app will depend on the value exchange but it won't be currency. The text is simply a roadblock to the killer app because one will not be able to reach the next stage because of regulation and the regulator will not allow you to reach the next stage because they will say it's too dangerous.
