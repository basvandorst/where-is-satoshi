Theres been proposed legislation in the US to waive capital gains on purchases under $600.
Not saying this doesnt open up a ton of new problems, but it has been acknowledged.

I put the word "password" through SHA256 encryption to secure my crypto.  How did anybody steal it?
Lol bro, it's gone.  Learn not to be a moron.

You're not as random or clever as you think.

As long as the path is already there.  This works if the LN suddenly appeared in near totality one day.  Right now very few of my friends use crypto and I would think the only common link with my buddies that do is with exchanges.
These exchanges sound a whole lot like banks in that light.  I'm not saying I personally don't see a difference, but trying to convince the average person that they need to move away from traditional banking for small transactions and move towards putting money in off chain channels seems like a bit of a stretch.  Given that LNs power comes from the number of connections itself, initializing the network is something to be worked out.  Especially given that in the current state of Bit coins fees, making the initial connections will not be free.

So then you have a sudden auto repair that's .001 BTC.  You're going to need to transfer more BTC into the channel to pay the repairman OR you're going to need the node to loan you the capital (which will surely come with interest and is almost indistinguishable from a bank).
I would believe any hopping on to or off of the channel is a main chain transaction.

If its a sack of gold you value, buy a sack of gold.
Stop stating your wealth in terms of crypto in anything else but crypto.

Once a channel is open either party can add BTC to the channel until it's closed.
However, I'm struggling to see a ton of real world scenarios where people are going to want to commit capital to deals that haven't really happened yet. I need to pay my buddy for dinner?  I'm not going to keep a channel open and I have no clue the next time we will exchange money (next week, next year, etc). With businesses this seems no different than using BTC to buy a gift card.

They do from my understanding.

Gold does have value, you can do things with gold.  If the technology behind crypto offers more utility than gold thats great (it does).
However, displaying wealth via terms of gold or USD diminishes what its trying to accomplish.  Its its own thing.
