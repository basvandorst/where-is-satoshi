Listen to the full interview.  
The first part is on Lighthouse, and the economic reasoning behind crowdfunding, in particular for software development.
Discussion of (lack of) progress on the Bitcoin protocol from minute 39: 
fees, blockchain size, incentives for mining given decreasing fees, mining centralization.
Discussion BitcoinJ, Tor, proof of passport from minute 55.

Anyone who sits on a relatively moderate stash of maybe just a 100 BTC, can spam-flood the network to jam payments for about a day and provoke a crash: 
Solutions are possible and underway, but are not there _yet_.  That adds an extra aspect of uncertainty to the current prices.

Miners in a mining pool have no clue what they're mining.  They're just calculating hashes.


I didn't even mention doublespending, neither does the EBA doc.  As if doublespending were the only issue...  To paraphrase Peter Todd: why not use Ghash.io as your bank and payment provider, since you seem to trust them?  Could be lot cheaper and more efficient than all this decentralised mining...


How interesting, since when do bitcoiners trust legal recourse more than algorithms and math?

How would a miner be able to blacklist malicious transactions?
There is no way to do distinguish "malicious" transactions - there's no indication for that apart from them having a higher fee than average. 
They're actually not malicious at all, they are just normal Bitcoin transactions.  The only thing is that they come in numbers the network at this moment is not prepared for.
@_date: 2014-06-24 22:15:26
I was there and have listened, sure, recommend watching the video too.
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:36:53
You cannot see where a transaction comes from.  Lowering the difficulty would mean increase the rate at which new bitcoins are created: that is what bitcoiners hate about fiat money.
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:18:19
X number of extra transactions per block requires increasing the max block size. That was the whole point of my initial post ;-)
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:58:01


Agree, but it's not there yet - not in the bitcoin daemons and even less in the clients.  And since it's not easy to come up with a protocol that result in a well-functioning market, I guess it will also take quite some time before we get there.
@_date: 2014-05-28 21:51:53
It piggybacked on it. Was on a few hours before bitcoin2014 so they could get some international speakers that were attending the BTCFoundation conference.

What you described is the ability of a financial services provider, called Circle, to accept money (dollars) from a customer in France, and to deposit that to a bank account of a customer in Somalia. 
NO BITCOIN IS INVOLVED. 
It is presented  to both customers as a BTC transaction, so Circle hides the transaction fee of a few percent in the difference between the BTC ask and bid price at the moment of depositing ("buying Bitcoin") and withdrawing ("selling Bitcoin").

On the one-minute Bitcoinwisdom, there was a strange pattern: several 1-minute dives of about $50, followed by almost complete retracements the next minute.
A Rotterdam-based financial specialist,  noticed that pattern too (screenshot is his) and came up with the following explanation:
"It seems (and this is just a guess as there is no official comment from the exchange) as if Bitfinex is running an algorithm to handle the margin calls. The algorithm starts selling but limits itself to a 10% drop in prices within 1 minute. If prices drop more than 10% in 1 minute it will stop selling and wait for buy orders to come in. Once there are again a certain amount of buy orders in the orderbook the algorithm starts selling again until all margin calls are met.
This seems to be an interesting way to deal with cascading margin calls but can also be considered as borderline market manipulation from the exchange side. By spreading out the sell orders over time the downwards momentum is reduced, however traders end up trading against the exchange itself and not the market anymore. The exchange has an informational advantage at that point and is therefore more likely to profit than the traders. Fortunately, this only lasted for about 10 minutes after which control was given back to the market."

Just to be clear, I do not imply that any of the people participating in the stress test were there at the conference.  
I just want to indicate the discussion about the ease (=low cost) with which blocks can be filled and the netwerk can be jammed has been going on for a little while already.
Interesting to see that already back then already, Gavin was more worried then Jeff Garzik ;-)

An extended stress test could destroy faith in Bitcoin, and cause the price cascading down.
The discussion isn't that new, here's a fragment of jgarzik and gavin discussing that threat at the 2014 Bitcoin Foundation Amsterdam conference:

Definitely.  The (I admit) contrived use case is an educational project where we prefund a number of addresses and let users do a number of exercises with their coins.  Access to the coins is distributed on paper via QR codes and/or mnemonic phrases.
We wanted to demonstrate you can use control over a private key as a way to authenticate.

It doesn't help non-Dutch people, since they probably do not have an account at one of the Dutch banks participating in iDeal.
It doesn't really help the Dutch either, since they've been able to buy bitcoin instantly from companies like  and   since more than 3 years now...  (iDeal is an online payment method that results in irrevocable payments, hence its popularity among web merchants in the Netherlands - almost 100% coverage and dirt cheap)
