Nice one I know Hargreaves Lansdown, will look into it. Yeah no worries, any bitcoin pension provisions would be in addition to my fiat pension (same as my bitcoin holdings are in addition to my savings) as whilst I am a believer - never risk what you can’t afford to lose!

Hey dude - also UK here. Really interested in how you’ve managed to get some of your pension fund into crypto. Please share some info, my company pension fund has been doing fair shite last few years (although their contributions are quite generous).

Really interesting read there - keep spreading the message and keep up the good work!

Erm so I’m not a local but on the main road that runs between Jewish quarter and the old town, hard to give better descriptions than that sorry.

After further reflection, maybe they can give me vodka for bitcoin...

Is this your shop? Will pop by and say hi if so!

Stumbled across this shop last night in Krakow. I was too many vodkas deep to see what it was all about, but will investigate later and report back. Possibly not today though, as I’m once again many vodkas deep.

Ahh okay, have to agree so far, seems a fantastic place. Sampling the mini golf pub (one of my favourite combinations) about 10 minutes from this place shortly before finding some polish drum n bass this evening. Krakow going to get fully sampled this evening.
Any tips from your visit?
