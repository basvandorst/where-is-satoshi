Yes, it took half a month. Today it was confirmed. Normal fee is pretty fast, but, yeah, 30E... Anyway, it was worth it, because I transfer all to my new ledger. Bread wallet is buggy as hell... I used it in IOS and Android.

Because mainstream media only cares when bitcoin is 14000 euros. They don't report how Venezuela, a fucked up country, has people using Bitcoin and it is making it easier to live and at least have something to eat. They only care when people can see $$$, lots of $$$, not the real value/objective of bitcoin.
But it happens with everything. Mainstream media reports general things in a general way.

I entered in this post because it does. I am using an iPhone. Sometimes I enter and shows me the message like if I installed for the first time the app...

Because he is confusing people saying BCH is the "real" BTC and trying to put down the throats of everyone all the BCH bs. Using bitcoin.com to promote BCH, the wallet creating BCH wallets for default, etc. He has done a lot before yes, but it is a great way to fuck up everything you have done doing dumb shit towards the community that you once helped.

I have little but I had my inversion back in like 6 months. I purchased more power (cloud mining). I aint saying numbers for obvious reasons, but even cloud mining is good (not for big bucks, but it is something). 
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:23:55
It was a gift for myself but yeah, it is great. I have been in BTC for 1 year but became a HODLer since 3 or 4 months :D
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:48:50
MINE IS THERE :) (I wanted to give some positivity) It is a wallet change transaction so I don't care. I get that right now the situation is a clusterfuck, all while the freaking big players adopt new technology that solves this (Segwit).
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:24:32
Roger ver said in an interview that when reached the limit it will be scaled again. 8mb blocks are huge, too much for everything. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:19:51
I was going to ask this question. If there is a fork ledger gives you an easy way to claim your forked coins? Like they just appear? New to HW wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:46:32

I am democratic and leftist. Fuck, I never knew I was alt right extremist. Glad to have the this news site to discover it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:27:00
I mean I am calm, but just to verify the "why isn't it confirming, it is segwit" thingy. Also I read that if the transaction stays in the limbo for a lot of time, it gets rejected, so, I can't lose the money. I don't mind waiting :) Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:49:46
Some, of course, but not all, and after few months, they usually are great new pets loving ya :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:52:26
Wait, what fork? I have been off bitcoin for christmas, I feel like I didnt get TOO MUCH INFO.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:51:47
I wanted to try cloud mining. I purchased 30$, I got them back after 5 months or less. It isn't pointless, but do it after reading a lot of info.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:23:44
Bitstamp does, bitpanda too. Lets use them.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:52:16
Is there any way to import the bread wallet seed to another segwit one? I am tired of the buggy as hell app with transactions and their non segwit ETA....
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:08:52
Burn........ Damn son.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:21:09
At least they are paying the fees to withdraw in GDAX... Even that doesnt make them rush for segwit adoption, they would save money and clear some of the congestion... Really, I can't see how it isn't the top priority (mentioning security etc is BS, they are different priorities)
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:12:28
I have way less than that lol I am more into Manning and money is coming slow but steady
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:49:32
Yeah, but I changed wallets (to HW) so my transaction is there, in da cloud pending. (I don't care to be honest, I am hodling)
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:49:38
I am more like "ok, if it standardizes and it is the normal digital payment method in the future, it will be pretty expensive (comparing it to fiat), so I am going to start mining now and keep the BTC that I generate for the future, to use them if I need them, or to use them as normal cash".
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:50:20
It is segwit, shouldn't it be quick and cheap?
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:49:51
I gifted it to myself. Tired of non segwit, buggy as hell mobile wallets :)
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:07:27
I am saving some of the r/btc propaganda. When it fails and this clusterfuck clears, I will post a dump of all the BS and empty acts that they were promoting.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:56:57
I like and prefer mobile wallets, I am sorry for this guy, but even in hardware wallets you are using a firmware, a device. We all agree that exchanges are a huge NO, but, between mobile wallets and hardware wallets, personally, I think it is more paranoia than security...
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:26:00
While you have the seed, you are ok, even if the wallet "closes business", yeah, bugs happen, even in hardware wallets, but my point was, mobile wallets are also secure.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:58:15
I gifted some bitcoin to my family. I am keeping them, but it is for them as a "told you that it is the future" thing. I will give them the opportunity to keep them or exchange it for fiat in 1 year, as a showcase. My uncle opened his gift (it was a letter)  saying "I am ok with this being everything but bitcoin", later he was like "Oh man..."  and he said that in 1 year it will be below than now. I didn't argue, he doesnt understand what it is, he just sees an "investment". He has been through hard economic problems lately, so he is like "fuck capitalism".
Anyway, long story short, if Bitcoin becomes mainstream, I am saving some for my family, because I don't want to be rich, I want to be free of banks and shady big money players.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:59:05
I try to, but even this post gets removed.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:46:50
Where I live you dont have to pay for a rescue, so if he paid for a rescue, my fault, but because he "had to sold" some bitcoin to get it, I thought it was bought, not rescued.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:13:07
But I don't trust anything but my personal cloud for storing the keys, and I kinda prefer having them in coinbase...
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:40:36
My two unconfirmed transactions to coinbase went both confirmed at the same time (the first one took lots of days...). 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:17:03
No worries :) 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:46:25
Nope, I mean i love bread, but sometimes it has annoying bugs. Wiping the wallet (to recover it again or recover another) for now it doesnt work and sometimes syncing the blockchain doesnt work, but, if you reinstall the app it syncs the blockchain so, it is ok. I guess they are busy with segwit and ETH (they will have ETH too!)
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:17:23
So miners are mining empty blocks, how does that seem ok? And if you use the core, and if blocks were 8MB you would need a lot of storage just to use the client.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:46:45
They are normal pets that where abandoned by a cunt, in few cases, gave to de adoption company because of money problems. Don't say it is a gamble, it isn't, they are normal. If  "Don't buy them adopt them" is *heavily* shaming someone, damn, you can't say nothing nowadays. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:14:29
Sorry, my barber accepts bitcoins... But at least you will be the second :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:29:39
At least withdrawing from Gdax is free and fast (at least for me when I used it). They have 10 mil customers, they won't and can't move that fast. They are already working on it for the short term. Let's pray...
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:14:54
Private keys are held by coinbase, that is why some people don't like it,and that is why you can get your account frozen, or as it is doing now in the US, giving data for taxes etc. If it is a site vulnerability, it covers, if it is because of users weak ass passwords it doesn't. It is like, if it is coinbase's fault, it is covered.
Edit: grammar

I am verifying with Bitpanda (I am in Europe), meanwhile I check Gdax for the interface and price, when I am used to Bitpanda, I will close my coinbase account and have an orgasm at the same time. Never felt so betrayed by a company, really.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:31:47
Yeah, but my point was more "look at his defense." A good person will never say "I dont need to be insulted I am self made billionaire." when you are "insulting" a coin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:34:58
I don't shame. I was just saying. There is no need to buy when hundreds of pets get abandoned each year for Christmas. I don't shame, just saying facts. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:51:35
I use Bitpanda, but I check Gdax for the interface :) The prices are in EUR btw...

It took them less than a week to give them my failed exchange BTC. I sent BTC for ETH and it didn't go through, they gave all back.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:42:11
So you removing the core wallet from the market, making blocks empty and making blocks bigger just when they are full...
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:58:47
Dunno where to. I haven't found a bitcoin subreddit as nice as this but without all of this moderation.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:38:52
It is nuts. I am having headaches. I was happy living in coinbase in a fancy world. (It is crazy but it is interesting being part of Bitcoin history, this will make us stronger) :) 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:15:20
No, LIES, BCASH will continue growing the blocks if needed (actual quote of a user in r/btc), because we have unlimited mining power to mine infinite MB blocks. Fuck BTC, all glory BCASH. WE ARE THE TRUE BITCOIN, BECAUSE SATOSHI WANTED TO HAVE BIG ASS BLOCKS.
(please note the irony)
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:37:59
I wouldn't call it spam. Some say that it is because of the haspower going up and because transactions are clearing. I have 4 pending transactions, that isn't spam and most users have lots of pending transactions too...
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:23:16
I love walking in socks at home... Also, I am weird, I love cold, I usually have my windows open even with 0 degrees (C) outside :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:04:42
A guy made a wallet.dat encrypted with 1 BTC in it. It is there, for the one that opens it. Still no one has decrypt it, so, pretty safe it is to have a wallet.dat I would say. I downloaded the wallet, no virus, but the chinesse page to download it is blacklisted by antivirus/smartscreen etc.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:43:47
I don't think there was spam at all, the network is pretty congested thanks to the non segwit players. Meanwhile, I am switching to Bitpanda (Gemini doesn't have segwit and it isn't available at all in Europe, you need an US phone), and a HW wallet, more than because of security, because they are awesome, segwit support was almost instant (comparing to mobile wallets)...
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:30:47
"I dont need to be insulted I am self made billionaire."
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:52:38
Bread wallet works for me. You have your keys, good security, simple, fast and economy fees (I wish custom in the future) and it works fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:25:21
Seems that they are working on it for "short term implementation"... 
@_date: 2018-08-25 08:48:46
So, what about "don't post how much you own" rule?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:06:53
3% of coinbase funds are online. Those are insured. The other part is in cold storage in different locations. (Coinbase security page). BTW, insured big the company gets hacked, if your account does, that isn't covered. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 09:45:47
You can search for a pic of keys on Google and print it, all of that while browsing Coinbase...

Well banking here in spain is pretty cheap. You can easily get a no fees account (each time I see fees being paid in other countries I just don't get why) and one bank gave (it was a huge promotion) free skimmers and account to shops to start accepting cards. It was long time ago so I don't know if know they are drowning in fees, but anyway  I would much preffer to pay scanning a QR code with my BTC wallet than using cash/cards.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:38:21
Just sent 200E to my wallet, 67 cents fee (some days ago 17)
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:54:38
In case someone is wondering, right now, Exodus calculates a fee of 0,11$ without putting the quantity.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:30:28
r/btc something to say about this? I have some money in BCH, just for "peace of mind", but in december I am going to sell, I hope that at that time it is high, i will use shapeshift to have my baby BTC's back. When coinbase releases BCH... Price is going to go down like a spaceX rocket landing...
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:29:19
See r/btc? Segwit wasn't the last hope of having a bigger block and making the fees lower... It isn't just increasing a number...
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:54:16
I really like Bread, but it is nice to see good wallets coming around :)

Yeah, it can explode too, like done coin hahaha

C) Selling the option to trade with it, not giving the code away.
As a developer myself, I would do it. Stock market has successful robots and they make money and they are not useless.
@_date: 2019-04-09 13:05:32
Not trying to sound rude, but I work in a ciber security firm. I would never download anything. I posted it to make some awareness and also ask if there are real ones, because they exist on the normal stock market.
But anyway, thanks for the advice :)

Well if it wasn't clear I was talking about Stellar. They say that they can handle bad actors with computers, but I guess they can't handle the same number that blockchain can.
@_date: 2019-04-19 23:13:32
Thanks for the empty reply. You know, we live in a world that we are fucking up, if caring about it is "nazi" well, fuck you ignorant cuck.
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:56:14
I guess. Nice interface tho.
@_date: 2019-04-19 23:19:57
Isn't it in a way to have multiple computers doing the same thing wasteful in a way? Like, if mining pool X wins the block mining pool Y has "wasted" their time. But yeah, I think is the most robust security wise and future proof.
@_date: 2019-04-09 09:56:32
I was thinking about it. Auto trading bots in normal stock market work well....
@_date: 2019-04-20 08:13:00
You're* caring*. Learn to speak before trying to insult someone.
@_date: 2019-04-20 19:08:18
The first part, yeah, I had a different idea, even tho I try to learn more about the blockchain. The second part, I wasn't trying to say that more transactions generate more need of energy, I was talking about the huge amount of energy being used for the network because of the difficulty balance. Thanks for the extended explanation, I guess the articlrs about mining and energy waste/pollution was sensationalized.
@_date: 2019-04-01 16:16:01
Bad timing to announce my first satoshi, right?
@_date: 2019-04-19 23:17:18

@_date: 2019-05-03 14:35:59
But, but, don't post how much you own... I get the excitement but damn... Why.
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:22:10
I went strongly to open source after discovering Bitcoin. One ideal led to another, and after years, I started looking for FOSS instead of private solutions or apps.
@_date: 2018-12-29 19:57:38
Or to make the transactions that costs you x3 times more... Without middle men, to make you own your money...
