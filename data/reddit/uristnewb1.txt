You've yet to introduce a single counter argument to my varied claims, other than saying I'm "ridiculous." This is obviously not a place for discussion, I'll be leaving now.

You literally CAN'T address that issue. Proof of Work is intrinsic to Bitcoin. Good luck getting everyone to agree to make the change to Proof of Stake....people can't even agree on blocksize increases. Not to mention that as adoption increases, so too does the energy required to do POW. Bitcoin will literally be (and in fact already is) producing enough GHG emissions that it represents a sizable increase in global climate change and regional air pollution in China. Top that off with a stuttering, slow, and expensive system, and it makes no fucking sense.

The traditional financial system is not (in energy expenditure) in the top 50 of largest emitters BY COUNTRY, ala bitcoin. And for the record, I don't envy this coin, and I do in fact want to see it fail. It no longer deserves a spot in the top of the market. Hundreds of coins do literally everything better by every metric, and investing in this dinosaur is only driven by the tendency for human greed, now. 
Technological innovation, banking the unbanked, decentralization of commerce, hell even being a viable p2p currency are all pipe dreams to bitcoin, and anyone claiming bitcoin is still contributing to these noble and beneficial goals is a liar, plain and simple. You're all celebrating the growth, which is fine, but that's essentially celebrating centralization and the fact that the hands of the few are beginning to control the entire market. Sure, bitcoin paved the way, created the tech, advanced it all, and if it showed ANY indication that it would be continuing on that path I'd be more than happy to invest and watch it grow. 
Now we have incoming futures markets, institutionalization, miner centralization, vast energy expenditure, incredible and ridiculous tx times, and for what? Sounds like another slave master to me. Good luck. I hope you make a ton of money on what appears to be just another money making device for the elite at the expense of the few. They'll either short the market in the coming months and destroy it or dump vast sums into it and control it. The system is broken--centralized, slow, and preposterous.

I'm not saying it's not perfect. I'm saying its currently the worst coin around, and I'm backing it up with pretty concrete and verifiable claims. I understand how you might think I'm just "choosing to see what I want to see," but I'd instead invite you to come up with some sort of counter argument about anything I've said. I'd like to make it clear I'm not *challenging* you personally--only your viewpoint. If it can't stand up to basic scrutiny, it's not viable, at least in my eyes. I'm curious as to your thoughts about some of the things I've mentioned. Rather than downvoting because you disagree, try to talk about why you disagree. It's better that way.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:39:21
I hope you find what you are looking for. I truly hope that the seed of doubt I may have planted finds roots in your mind, at least enough to critically look at some aspect of this budding, modern economy with a modicum of intelligence. Enjoy chasing your gains, man. I hope you get a big ol' lambo and some hookers to tide you over. It's okay if you donate school supplies, right?

17 BILLION DOLLAR 24 HOUR VOLUME. Up from 9 billion in the previous set of 24. If you don't see a footprint of major financiers...you can't see anything.

No one wants to mention IOTA when speaking of scaling. It's the elephant in the room.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:55:16
That's all well and good, but the energy increase is exponential as block difficulty increases with adoption. Even with renewables the whole thing is just a waste. It's inherently unsustainable.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:23:57
A single transaction also caused as much energy use (in coal) as 8 average United States households use in an entire 24 hour period. BTC is disgustingly bad for the environment, and so charitable causes like this are bittersweet, to say the least. It's like clubbing a bunch of seals and then donating some school supplies and saying job well done.

Dominion? The Internet is a public utility that every human on earth should have access to. It's changed everything and enables so much opportunity for billions of people.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:57:29
God, not now. Not now. Check out some of the latest info on transactions, it's pitiful.

All highlighting the major issues that have been hounding and will continue to hound BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:56:08
But you have to pay bills in fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:31:35
Good for you, being cautious. Please retain that caution and do not be swayed by others on this forum and others: DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:03:58
You do seem confident about that. Can you help me understand how that solves long term scaling issues?    
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:26:10
I agree and understand that about BTC, but that fact doesn't mean we have to look them as the oracles and seers...the moment we do that is the moment we hand them the market and chance of making bitcoin what it set out to be. IMO, this fork is already a prime example of corporate interests manipulating the course of its evolution. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:32:00
Nothing could be further from the truth, have you seen this place lately?
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:57:07
"This company" in title, "my company" in comments. Be honest, man.
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:44:03
Ah, my mistake, I interpreted it as a comment on the community, not the tech. Sorry!
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:03:43
Um... you realize that this is about PREVENTING regulation of the internet? I'm very confused.
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:40:21
Fair enough
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:20:54
You really sound confident in Bitcoin as a currency, hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:46:09
In what world does Bitcoin work fine? You are disincentivized from using it because of the transaction fees. It's a dinosaur, transaction-wise. Aside from the percieved value, Bitcoin is the Western Union of crypto transactions and some of these other coins are lightyears ahead tech wise. I have no doubt Bitcoin will reign supreme from years of dumb money, and I do have a small amount, but it's almost certainly going to be one or two of the alts that will take the small and micro-transacrion P2P market to new heights of mass-adoption. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:11:29
Thereby underlining the current impossibility of mass adoption of Bitcoin as a currency instead of, as I so frequently hear, a "store of value."
 
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:41:27
Yes. Or, considering the returns, maybe pocket a thousand and see what happens
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:27:55
I'm sitting here cackling into a bottle of gin at this comment. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:00:28
Still neglecting the fact that I don't want ANY regulations in favor of these monopolistic interests. My Internet is a free internet, not some pipeline with on/off switches and economically motivated chokepoints and tolls.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:46:05
The question to ask is: Does this solve the long-term scaling issues for BTC at all?
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:09:08
You use Bitcoin for back and forth between friends? How rich are you? The fees....
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:33:10
I do not argue that. I am arguing that you are still left with the same ultimate problem as you had before sidechaining, and you make the system needlessly more complex and more easily manipulated.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:32:13
At the very least take out your principle.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:19:25
Sidechain transactions do not solve the scaling issue at all, I am getting tired of people claiming this over and over. Check your information and reread what sidechaining does--it just shunts work around and eventually it's gotta connect back into the master chain. Same issues.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:40:26
You'll pay a ridiculous price for the food given the fees right now...seems silly.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:51:10
I'd appreciate an answer to my question, first, if you don't mind. I'm curious to know what you think sidechaining will do to alleviate the long term scaling issues for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:37:18
They want to be somewhere that people look for information so they can control pricing and psychology of the market just like they control everything else. FUCK this bank. Isn't the point of Bitcoin, at least partially, to distance ourselves from this speculation and oversight by massive controlling interests? Profits aside, I'm hating the political direction Bitcoin is going.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:35:48
Confirmation bias made you invest? Woah
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:19:31
Or was it merely created to play to your *idea* of a level-headed viewpoint towards Bitcoin? One must ask these questions when consuming any media.
*flies away*
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:48:39
Look up more about BTC...the fees are the same if you are charging 1.00 or 10,000. It changes only if you ha e multiple inputs. You're looking at like 4 dollar fees right now for normal transactions at the very least, and that's assuming you don't mind waiting 2-3 hours for your first confirmation. I can't believe I'm even describing bit coin right now, what a fucking joke.
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:28:38
It's literally just looking at the percent change, dude, haha!
