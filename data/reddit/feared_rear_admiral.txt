We're talking about Thailand here where the [average temperature]( doesn't even fall below 20 at the lowest and usually comes at around the higher 20s and lower 30s (degrees Celcius). Why would you want to build a data center/mainframe/mining rig there? Just running the air conditioning necessary for the cooling would use as much electricity as the miners themselves. Wouldn't you be better off running it in like Iceland or northern Canada or something like that where it's cold pretty much all year?

Ok even if he did make away with everyone's bitcoins, wouldn't that be a really bad idea considering that move might actually destroy the Bitcoin economy? I don't see that as likely now, but say two years ago when this all started, thinking up a heist like that is just freaking absurd. It's like "stealing" all the shares for a company and then declaring the company bankrupt.
It would make more sense *not* to steal the damn bitcoins and instead let everyone happily trade forever more while paying fees in the millions all damn day long. I mean imagine if somehow Bitcoin crashed to like a dollar now because of this, good fucking job you just liberated 800K from a company that made MILLIONS in revenue.
I would sooner think whoever did that heist would steal the actual money. Just everything about this whole thing is fucking insane. Not saying you're wrong though, just saying it is an incredibly boneheaded thing to do.

I am inclined to believe this line of thought. Keep in mind that the market is also ever expanding, and becoming more complex. On this subreddit alone there's just over 100,000 readers, 12,000 on Then there's the various bitcointalk style forums, the trollboxes and the proper news sites (Coindesk, newsBTC). *Then* there's the proper investor/daytrader types who manage a range of portfolios and decided to give cryptos a crack now since the market is just forming.
I think there's more information out there and treating the consensus in this subreddit as well as others as gospel is a little dangerous.
That said, at this stage we should be well aware that bitcoin (as well as altcoins) are so small now still that even though we might understand the finer details (such as that some exchanges suck ass and knowing which places to avoid/seek out), the vast majority of the population doesn't. For most people "bitcoin" is having some trouble right now. There may well be an article in economics newspapers that mentions how the "price of bitcoin" has crashed to nearly 10% of its value. Yes it did, on MtGox, and no, it's not the "price of bitcoin", it's how it is on one exchange that chose to shut the gates and became a closed system.
Anyway I'm rambling, long story short there is more complexity to the markets and different people do different things for different reasons. Not everyone selling now is doing so because of Gox shenanigans. Who knows, somebody just made a fat stack of money and as it deflated from 1000 downwards decided that's a good enough price point for them to exit the market. Or they are selling their coins to make another investment somewhere else. Or they are just losing confidence in this whole bitcoin thing. Or it's miners who were just offloading coins as they always do. Or a litany of many more possible reasons. It's the cumulative effect that reflects market sentiment, and it's difficult to point out what is "causing" this sentiment.

Really? I would have thought an overall lower temperature helps for the heat exchange. i.e. it's a hell of a lot easier to cool something down with air that is at 15ºC rather than 30ºC, considering you want to keep the rig at around 20-30ºC in the first place (just judging from regular PC temperatures). Wouldn't they overheat?
What I meant was: run an AC to cool down the air, operate regular fan coolers on the hardware. I suppose you could run some kind of ducted AC system *through* the actual units rather than trying to cool down the entire building but that would be even more complicated.

Well that's the problem isn't it? Governments want to keep selling weapons to make money and at the same time talk butthurt about how they "fall in the wrong hands". If there weren't so many goddamn weapons being produced and in circulation they couldn't even go to terrorist groups in the first place.
A global referendum on arms production and trade would do more for the global good than playing whack-a-mole with suspected arms traders and their bank accounts or whatever.
Implying of course the governments even want to stop actual insurrection and violence in mostly the third world. Which they don't really. A healthy civil unrest in a resource rich area is a great pretext for a hegemon to go in and pacify the area.

Side question: if the difficulty adjusts to the hash power of the mining pools in total, wouldn't that imply that if no one ever upgraded their hardware and/or added more miners the difficulty would stay roughly the same?

I know what you're saying but it's in our best interest to actually see to a proper resolve rather than washing our hands of it. Imagine you're someone who's never heard of bitcoin - a guy tells you about the Satoshi white paper, how the whole point of it is to stave off top-level corruption and market manipulation. Then you see a top exchange go down in flames with suspicions of fraud and insider trading all abound. And the response from the community is to lay the blame on their *customers*. And here you are again, saying how it's "nobody's fault but the people that trusted Gox". How about it's Gox's fault that they committed such enormous fraud and/or incompetence? Why would anyone want to be involved in such an enormously abusive and arrogant community? Don't you realise the complete hypocrisy that bitcoin is all about wresting power over money away from the institutions but frequently has exactly that type of scandal happen to it?
If anything we have to take a stand against those scam-runners and show some responsibility, rather than look down on the *suckers* that ran afoul of bad practices.

I never really got how that is part of the pro Bitcoin argument. *Every single transaction* can be traced and verified in the blockchain, however randomising services can throw a spanner in the works there. So yeah, *now* wallet addresses are not tied to an identity, and no one knows which one and how many belong to which person. But all it takes is for governments worldwide to make a law that there can't be anonymous wallets anymore, just like for bank accounts. This is completely feasible, *especially* when governments actually accept bitcoin and implement proper regulations so it can be integrated into the rest of the economy. Do you think bank account software right now inherently needs identification? The fact that you add a name to a bank account is just a programming issue, and is something required by law. I don't see any reason governments can't implement that for bitcoin. It's harder because it's worldwide and decentralised but they can still do it.


Are you fucking kidding me? Ok it's a little better now but on a PC, doing anything with bitcoin is fucking annoying at best. How do you bitcoin without entering tons of annoying numbers? Have you even *seen* what a wallet address looks like? It's enough to give someone an aneurism, it's clearly meant to be handled in-software. If you want to convince Joe Blow that entering a 10+ convoluted code into Blockchain.info *twice* is easier than logging in to paypal you're gonna get laughed at. Yes Paypal, the enemy of bitcoin. Put in an email with a password and you are buying stuff. Nevermind all the other issues about currency control and stuff, bitcoin has a long way to go till it's as easy to use and intuitive as online banking and shopping *right now*.

That really is a genius concept. It sounds to me like the next logical step in automation. Though a lot will still depend on human input at first. Reading through the page, I can't help but doubt the "this has the potential to end material scarcity" aspect - material scarcity doesn't come about because we don't have robots building things, it's because the actual materials become more rare / harder to build / more difficult to mine, i.e. factors beyond the control of the seed factory itself. Also, what happens when machines become obsolete in that factory? What if the factory changes direction and decides to drop a product, along with the production process hat goes with it?
I do like the concept a lot though. It would be cool if it works alongside a really hardcore efficiency modeling AI that adjusts the process periodically to make it run better.

The blockchain system really is the platform technology of note, not necessarily Bitcoin itself as a currency. Bitcoin is great testing grounds for the concept of cryptocurrency in genereal but it can be refined by adding more and different features to the source. There are features people haven't used yet in the Bitcoin sourcecode afaik, plus develop their own so there is lots of room for improvement.
But in practical terms it's basically the open-source crowd-owned version of the kind of transaction network that Visa, Mastercard, Paypal etc. and the banks have had for a long time now but entirely proprietary and behind closed doors. Not to mention reliant on one institution - if your bank with your money goes down you have lost your money. With BTC you can have it in an exchange in which case you'll lose it if that goes down (goodspeed to all Gox customers!) but you can basically make your own online banking account system. Need just a rough as guts wallet that only holds your coins? Or something that is more versatile and allows for more features? It either already exists, or someone's working on it or you can make it yourself!
Ultimately I can see cryptocurrency become the backend to online transaction in total, if not a currency in its own right.
@_date: 2014-11-18 10:53:00
People will laugh at this sort of thing (hurr do they even have internet and smartphones), but I think it's more likely we'll see some genuine need-driven adoption in the developing and impoverished world sooner than in the developed countries. A mild sense of "Fuck the Banks" is IMO not as much of a motivator as having to wrest the reins of an economy that is in the hands of a corrupt, and especially, *actively collapsing* system. It's when government sanctions are imposed and Visa, American Express etc. decide not to honour your country's transactions anymore that you will think of taking up Bitcoin and never go back. Remember that the whole point of Bitcoin is that it's a disruptive, empowering economic force. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 03:54:16
Why even *bother* about what currency terrorists would use when the problem is that they're using it to buy weapons and equipment? So we'll have a big cry that *maybe* someone's going to use bitcoins for anonymous transaction but we're gonna throw our hands in the air in the face of truckloads of weapons being sold on the black market somehow, right under our fucking nose. Where do those weapons come from? Ever considered tracing *them*?
Give me a fucking break. Cracking down on the illegal arms trade, or even the *legal* arms trade would be the way to end terrorism. Don't matter what currency you use when you can't get your hands on some guns to shoot people with.

When a bank realises they can't actually pay out all their customers so they bail out with what money is left, i.e. fake bankruptcy.
I think. Correct me if I'm wrong.
edit: Wrong. It's when there is a stampede by all the customers to pull money out of a bank , bringing the bank to the verge of bankruptcy as they have money loaned away and not necessarily have all the funds to reimburse their customers.  Sorry I had it mixed up, it's when people make a run for the bank, not when the bank itself makes a run for it.

Jesus Christ this reminds me of that guy who wrote that he sold his house and converted *everything he had* into bitcoin. I can't find it but I swear it's out there, it was in a thread similar to this one. Then there's the reddit ~~founder~~ admin who espoused that "don't invest more than you are willing to lose" is a fallacy and it doesn't apply this time.
edit: this thread is going to be fun to revisit in a year's time.
edit: this is the story I was thinking about:  OP has deleted most responses, which were filling in some more of the story like being homeless and not needing money etc. etc. Not so crazy from the outset, the post is just about someone asking him "how Bitcoin is doing". The details came out in the comments.
The story of the reddit admin (not founder AFAIK) is that of RyanXCharles who wrote a wonderful blog post about saving all his money in Bitcoin that has since been taken down:  Oh and it's [this]( Ryan X Charles who was fired from Reddit after basically spending all his time porting the Bitcoin core to Javascript for some reason.
The reason I remember this so vividly is that it was quite the wakeup call to myself to *take it easy* with blowing more money on what has so far been the worst investment of my life. And to step away from and and for a bit and just think about some things. Please for the love of whatever is holy to you, get it in your head that currently the protocol, the infrastructure, the technology, the software framework etc. etc. are an **entirely different matter** to what is happening in the market. The IT aspects of Bitcoin are astounding. The real world market aspects of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general right now are downright criminal. It's manipulated to all hell and back, the shit that goes on in those markets would have landed people in jail many times over if it was done in any other market.

The problem is we don't really know how high/low it's gonna get. When it hit $200 back in April it was hailed as a ridiculously high benchmark and news was all over the internet. The boom now makes that look quite small in comparison and I haven't seen a lot of buzz on the internet media outside of the BTC community in the last few days now that it's reached $800.
Anyways, now with adoption among people as well as difficulty rising shouldn't it flatten out at some point? As a commodity it's fine if it fluctuates wildly but that hurts the legitimate use as currency I would think. Imagine a major currency like the USD or Euro going through such massive fluctuations right now, it would throw the world economy entirely out of whack.

One thing I don't understand, pardon my ignorance, how do people buy or sell when really the bitcoins just change hands? I mean, how does me selling a big load of bitcoins change the marketplace when they don't actually go back to a central bank but are distributed to people? I know places like BitPiggy, BitInnovate etc. are functioning as quasi banks (in the sense that they have a lot of money to back transaction risk, not that they are holding people's money), is that it? I know I sound like a massive noob, pls explain how bitcoin price is affected by trade of bitcoins between entities (as opposed to added to the market by mining).

There was an update [recently]( that said that. To be fair though it says "shipped" rather than sold so it's a bit unclear.

Sorry to say but your teacher is a dipshit who can't fathom the idea that people as old as 14 actually understand something about the real world. Take it up with anyone who will listen, your piece is not wrong or poorly written and it wouldn't get a 0 even if it was the worst piece anyone's ever handed in.

I find it funny that the news article is basically a summary of a reddit thread that day.

It wasn't much though.

Oh ok, fair enough. It still is rather serious.

I still don't quite understand how using bitcoin for transactions is at all advisable at this moment. I'm all for the currency, but imagine you make a bunch of sales and then the BTC value drops by half the next week. Unless you convert to fiat straight away, you're playing a high risk game with the value of your business. Some people are down with that, I can't imagine everyone being comfortable with that at all. It's hard enough to make a product that's profitable, you don't want to fuck it all up by using an unstable currency.
Of course if there's greater market penetration and more stability of BTC value it'll even out eventually. Ironically, to get there we ought to do more of the "using it as a currency" and less the "using it as a commodity to speculate on" which is what we're a bit afraid of to begin with.

I suppose it doesn't help that the price is so high right now for the casual observer to consider. Then again it doesn't matter so much as far as BTC is concerned. Hard to tell. The fact that BTC doesn't really operate in base 10 delimited currency (like dollars and cents) with a tendency for whole numbers doesn't really help and makes it a bit unwieldy. Remembering prices like 0.00347 BTC or whatever gets a bit tedious, it's even more unwieldy if the value gets even higher and you end up with price tags like 0.000012857488.
I wonder what a good strategy is to get around that, purely from a marketing and psychology perspective. Perhaps 10^(-x) scientific notation? Or milli/micro/nano etc.
edit: on the base10/ delimited thing; What I mean is say how the AUD (I'm from Australia, we'll use that as an example) comes in 5, 10, 20, 50 cents and 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 dollar coins and notes. These tiers are kind of arbitrary but they make sense in an everyday sense, and act like artificial psychological barriers (i.e. don't know if I want to cut the 50 right now sort of deal). With BTC all that goes completely out the window and prices for things would look more like scientific constants rather than easily understandable whole integer numbers. You never pay $0.0005 for something, yet BTC goes to 10^-12 (as far as I know, at this point in time).
