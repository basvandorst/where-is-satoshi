[serious] What misinformation? All he said was that it is owned by Roger and that he was the one who forked. Are any of the 2 statements wrong?

This is the worst time to sell, wait about a month or so when it comes back up.

woah, so how much did this charge you?

Well, people use it more as a phonebook/birthday reminder these days. I don't think I know anyone that actually posts anything. My feed is filled with ads and crap.

Do they have a mobile app?

I had some dogecoin tipped to me a few years ago (a few cents) too bad I can't reclaim it. I lost the phone that had them in the wallet

My opinion: I don't think you should withdraw it all. 
Say something like I just discovered I have some BTC and it's worth over 250k (not a lie) or however much.
Ask for her opinion. Withdraw and buy the house or keep it?
I think you should avoid the mortgage because you'll end up paying over 100k in interest over a 30 year loan. Plus that will free up that monthly payment.
This way she won't quit her job because you guys have to eat. You have a house which you can always sell in case of extreme emergency. You'd have made 250k profit on your BTC already.

I signed up when there were only around 6000 people waiting in line. I have a screenshot of it-- and still don't have access.
