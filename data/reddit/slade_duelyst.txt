or make those same people you hate pay your fees, by moving them to gdax and then send to any wallet for free.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:06:56
They do decrpyt your files upon payment received. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:16:01
because it is. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:57:55
lol yes lots of people are working on it.  Its called Lightning Network.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:47:48
Or coinbase can add segwit and batching, instead of the dumb idea of just increasing block size. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:05:54
I have yet to see a ransomeware that doesnt decrypt your files after they receive payment.  The reason they decrypt after payment is to keep people paying. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:13:56
Or make coinbase pay for your fees, and never pay for them again.  Move coins to GDAX, (free offchain transfer almost instant) then move coins to your wallet, (gdax covers fees)
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:24:08
Dont invest in crypto if you have to ask this question, go to math class first.
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:40:03
you move the bitcoin to an exchange that sells to USD.  Then you sell.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:32:33
You guys are all wrong, this is a bug in GDAX, it will sometimes show the price of ETH, LTC or BCH in your feed.  So 950 was hit on eth, and thats what you see.  Youll sometimes see the price of LTC pop up into the BTC feed as well.  This sale did not happen. 
@_date: 2019-07-01 06:20:04
You send small amounts of btc to people and when they spend it you can track them.

It doesnt follow the BTC, wherever your BTC was stored at the occurrence of the fork should have equal Bitcoin diamond.  So you would need to know the private key and sweep it into a bitcoin diamond wallet.

Lightning works great for me. Instant basically free. Here is where you would say "you still need to open and close channels."  Which is correct I opened 2 channels with 25cent fees because I could wait.  Then I've done 500 lightning transactions for essentially free.  Not bad.  Now I could close them if I wanted to but no need for now.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:25:28
You can only lose all your money if it goes to 0 or you lose your private keys if you store the bitcoin yourself.  Or if you leave the money on an exchange and the exchange gets hacked.   You can also lose all of it through leveraged trading. Otherwise you cant lose all of your money.

@_date: 2017-12-03 20:53:09
You do realize its because during the years 2013-2015 less than a few thousand people reported any bitcoin earnings to IRS at all.  The IRS is pretty sure more people should have reported earnings and are going after them.  They are not going after people who buy in now, so they are not targeting people who invest in crypto, just people who invest in crypto and dont report earnings.   So all you need to do is report your earnings when you sell.

Thanks for quality post.

when you moved your money from coinbase to a different exchange(not gdax) or your wallet, you will be paying a transaction fee.  Go try to send bitcoins in coinbase and it will show the transaction mining fee. Moves from GDAX to coinbase or coinbase to another coinbase is free as there is no transaction on the blockchain.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:55:23
Your experience is now false in terms of current behavior, the app was updated, and is not what you described, the difference in what you described vs what is happening now is what people are upset about.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:25:03
No it's not just coinbase, if you move from a personal wallet to another personal wallet, you need to pay transaction fee, you can manually set it, but if it's to low miners will ignore it, so to get the transaction done people are paying more and more 
@_date: 2018-09-15 17:24:52
Best choice. Monero and BTC are my focus.
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:35:05
Im 100% confident coinbase didnt scam you and you will get your money back.  Coinbase is legit, no need to worry.

I would argue that 2fa as a whole relates to crypto. Most people in crypto have access to exchanges and these exchanges you buy and sell crypo like bitcoin. These exchanges all have 2fa solutions.  Thats for protection of hot live bitcoin and obviously you then would have your cold storage to move the bitcoin to.  2fa is a part of protecting your coins on exchanges.

You don't need to open a channel with everyone you want to pay.  You basically can open a channel with anyone.  It's like filling up your debit account with cash.  Then you can pay to anyone on lightning.

But won't the automated spam callers just pay the tiny fee?  They obviously make money from these robo calls and with lightning super cheap they would just pay it.  The non spam callers they don't make anything off their calls so instead even less real people would make phone calls, and more ads and spam who can automate and easily pay.
Am I missing something?

I cant answer for sure, but if i was you I would not be using that PC with crypto at all and move funds to a new wallet that are not stored on that PC.  Ideally you would move your funds to a hardware wallet, that way you can use your wallet even on an infected machine.

All wallets are same speed, speed is more based on your fee you pay to be included in next block.   Bitcoin creates a block roughly every 10 minutes and if you paid a fee you will get in the next block.  Send the money to the address when the site your using says to, and you will be all set.

That doesn't really make much sense, things move by percents.  Lets say bitcoin is 100 dollars, and you want to make 5%, you buy at 100 and sell at 105, that is a 5% gain.  Now lets say bitcoin is 100000 a coin and you want to day trade and get 5% gains, you would need it to go to 105000.  If i used 1 million dollars(my capital) in both of those scenarios i made the same amount of money, but bicoin went up 5000 dollars vs only 5 dollars.

For small transfers of money, it should be generally fine.  Its probably better for stores to just accept the 0 and take the risk that this single dude isnt orchestrating some masssive 51% attack or attempting a double spend.

If im a store selling a regular items ranging from $1dollar to like a few thousand dollars, id rather accept the 0 and allow my employee to move on to the next customer.  If you were a busy store and had to wait for all confirmations, the amount of money you would have saved from a double spend attack is going to be 0 in all likelihood.   Its worth the risk in many store front scenarios.  LN is better.

Monero you can only rent 8% of the 100% needed via nice high. To get the rest you need to acquire the hardware, and with no known asic that would be way way way more expensive to 51% attack

That's dumb, lightning is literally a peer to peer network.   Zero trust.

What do you mean, the idea is the decentralized exchange runs entirely on a decentralized blockchain?  How is that centralized?
@_date: 2019-01-30 19:51:16
Good news is if your connected to a well connected node it should be able to route.  Id recommend a couple well connected payment channels to be safe.

Sites could use micro payments like this instead of ads maybe?

What happened was the spam email was sent out, made some headlines then people forgot. You wont get any updates. There are different email spam attacks everyday, the odds of tracking these down, and track them down to a place you have control to arrest someone is so low that a majority of spam emails go nowhere in terms of who created it, and if they get in trouble.  Spam definitions for emails were updated thats all that happened.

Yes it was well coordinated. They used a phishing site to get credentials.  They were then able to generate api access keys. Instead of stealing from these accounts,  they used them all at the same time to buy all of 1 coin they had set up sell walls way above market that got bought. How is this a publicity stunt?

Do you not read before you comment.  Like did you see withdraw and only that word and assume OP meant selling?  I hate people who comment before reading.   Also withdraw bitcoin to an account doesn't sound that confusing. He may have an account on an exchange, and I think that's more fitting than wallet.
@_date: 2018-07-18 06:46:50
Oh no he posted pictures of his kids to the internet!?!?!?!??! And they have 100 dollars worth of money that we probably can't steal even if we stole the kids.  Paranoid crazies.

Lmao. This shows which subreddit you were able to get behind a pointless poll.  Use BCH if your a dumbass.

I agree, I wanted to actually spend some BTC and went to newegg.  During checkout it was bitpay, and I was really confused, there was no bitcoin address to send the bitcoin to.  My wallets, ledger and coinbase dont support the payment protocol so to be able to spend by bitcoin I would need to move to another wallet before i could buy.  I decided to use my credit card.
@_date: 2018-04-26 02:18:28
You saw the unconfirmed transaction on the ledger.

Yes because you can't shut it down.

You sound ill-informed if you only see bullshit on that channel and no value.

But what if you do have your own node.  I have had my own full node with lightning for 6 months.

Keep this private. People will come for them

1. You need to put your BTC that is locked safely away into an exchange.
2. A 50% dip would put you at 0, can BTC go down 50%.... yes... in a day.
3. Why not 1.5x, or 3x or .5x? All of these have their own risk/rewards, also most people dont even understand leverage trading.

I dont see a prediction, i see the current chart, and then whitespace until the next halving, a chart with a prediction would have lines after the current date showing what it might do.   this chart helps the viewer make a prediction when they look at the chart, but the chart itself isnt a prediction?

The speed issue with crypto is not your connection to the internet that is the issue.  So crypto transactions on 3g 4g or 5g would all take the same amount of time because your internet speeds are not the bottleneck.
so this is a dumb post.

Wait you are unhappy that it was a pain in the ass to remove 2fa from your account?  i feel like Id rather have to jump through 100 hoops to remove 2fa instead of a simple automated or other process.  I mean just dont use 2fa if you want it easily removed. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:37:04
It's pretty simple.  Less supply being added each day.  So less supply.  If demand stays the same then price goes up. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:13:51
Yep and these people who tried to do this at 3k btc are giving their BTC to people who are rooting for btc to go up.  Greedy dumb dumbs.

I dont know what your talking about.  Lightning network running your own node which this supports is fully decentralized. You seem uneducated.

there is no price prediction on this chart?  This is the current chart, just showing how far away the next halving is.  No predictions.

So FB is using some form of security checksn on the URLS.  I imagine its using some automated system and these websites are being flagged for some reason. Chances are its a coincidence that the blocked website is crypto.  I imagine if you find 10 really not popular websites from other categories you may also find a block.  i also imagine its not all crypto websites because i am able to send crypto websites. So chances are this is a false positive on a system and its just happens to be crypto website, as i bet the site comes back not clean from URL checks.

Why are you putting education in quotes?  Its simplified quick overview of interesting topics.  They may not be 100% right always, but no one is, and more people/channels making education interesting/appealing to people is a good thing.

So of they used a different name you might use them? Because bitcoin core is not only implementation of Bitcoin.

14 dollar convenience fee of not having to wait for the bank deposit, then when it goes through to move to coinbase pro then set a limit order.  This may seem very simple but so many people dont understand what limit orders even are.  So for the 14 dollars he paid, he didnt need to wait for the bank transfer and didnt need to learn about limit orders or anything.  Not bad.   I do use [coinbase.pro]( but i can see why the fee is fine for the average joe.
