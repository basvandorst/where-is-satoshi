buyers waiting under 9300

figured as much. I’ve been watching the action since yesterday and every time it got over 9350 sell orders would pop up, usually 17,  Today, the orders were bigger, sometimes 20, even 50. Pretty consistent. Surprised it held up so well, for this long, because it was relentless.   Wish they would take a breather!

Warren Buffett thinks he knows bitcoin. Here is what he says now about making the wrong call on Google and Amazon. He said, “I made the mistake in not being able to come to a conclusion where I really felt that at the present prices that the prospects were far better than the prices indicated."
He might want to save that quote. He may need it again, once he’s gained 20/20 vision on bitcoin.

If anyone is thinking about adding to their position you might consider it now. I saw 150 sitting there on Bitfinex and watched it get taken out pretty quickly.  Thought it was gonna tank. But, whoever it was just put another 120 on the table and there is still some left at 8130 - 5 minutes later.

Nice little bounce. Up $150, beginning with the support noted at 8130

There are only a handful of states where Robinhood will allow you to trade crypto. I signed up hoping to reduce the high fees I pay on Coinbase, but it’s not an option here in Georgia.
If they offer it, I would use it. But I would likely move my crypto to an offline wallet. You only get what you pay for.

Someone is selling big lots on bitfinex. Can’t tell if they are attempting to push the market down or if they are profit taking.

Ya think? Does it matter, they are just trying to get information from foreign actors. They want to be in a position to move on these exchanges if they think the exchanges are not following the rules. Notice Coinbase is not mentioned, because they are not concerned about legal activities.
We will see a nice bounce back, and rather quickly. Nothing to see here, go back to your seats, not to worry.

This on the heals of institutional buying, is just what the doctor ordered!
We will lose a lot of weak hands in short order.
That should make for a quick bounce, and back above 8k, without even breaking a sweat.
