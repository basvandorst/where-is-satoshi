Hello from BlackPearl public node here.
You should backup your channels when the channels.backup is changed.
You can track that with:
md5sum channels.backup
If the MD5 is changed then do backup.
In case of power fault don't use your old .lnd directory but I strongly suggest you to create a new one restoring from seed.
Only after that you can safely import your exported channels.
Tested some lnd versions ago. It has worked.
Sorry for your loss, man.

Yes it is. The file changes if a channel opens or closes.
However you must have the latest valid channels.backup file, backupped with exportchanbackup.
In case of filesystem corruption is important to recreate the lnd directory by restoring it with the seed.

First of all thanks for your response.
My problem is that the linux user doesn't have access to debug.log file but has the access to bitcoin-cli via rpc user/password.
That's why I was searching for something related to bitcoin-cli
@_date: 2019-05-03 21:59:36
So it seems that there is no way to do that via bitcoin-cli.
Thanks for your help. I'll use your solution making debug.log group readable :)
