Off the top of my head Tivol in KC has been taking BTC since 2013. Overstock who sells Rolex also since 2013. A shop in Florida took it as well. Was too drunk when I bought that one. Anyway I'm sure it is 10 seconds on Google.

lol. they can only make btc go up by destroying usd
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:24:30
They would be gone. There were some 2fa gold coins made but not funded.
I have one of everything ever made by mike other than the 500 bar and the litecoin bar.  
Also I'm not sure if this is a full set or not.... the silver coins 1btc have 2 different stickers.. s2 and s3. I have a roll of 12 of the s2 if OP needs it. Only 45 were made.
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:18:04
