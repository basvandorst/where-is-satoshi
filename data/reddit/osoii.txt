I'm in the same camp. It is possible to imbed child porn in the block chain. It is obvious that people will do that. This is not good for bitcoin.

I couldn't have said that better myself.

Oh, carry on.

No you aren't

Please someone tell me I'm wrong here. Doesn't the ability to put pictures, programs, etc. into the blockchain make it the obvious choice for pedophiles to distribute child porn? Which would mean an easy way for governments to make it illegal and cause the size of the blockchain to balloon?

That exactly depicts traders in general.

The simple answer is that there is little reason not to. Sell the coins for dollars as soon as you receive them and charge an amount of bitcoins equal to the amount of dollars you would charge. Simple.

...The fed sets a target and prints more or less to achieve it. Looking at how fast the printing presses are moving and saying "OMG at that rate... etc. etc." is nonsense.

Wow.. what a joke.

lol, you don't have to go as far as Russia to find that kind of corruption.

and after 100 merchants one of them gives up his address and that's the end of it.

Mtgox could declare tomorrow that they are individually judging each transactions merit before each transaction and it would be a free market. The choices participants make have nothing to do with whether a market is free or not.

No shit, it's big news right now.

... It is dangerous, it's dangerous as hell. You're still talking mostly nonsense.
edit: and you're right, it's a very faulty measure of inflation.

You're talking about introducing the volatility of currency speculation into the healthcare industry... That's nonsense. Lets be practical, the benefit of bitcoin over US currency in this example is nothing. Less even because for a doctor to use bitcoin he needs to convert it into US $. The changing exchange rates are only beneficial if they change in his favor, and the volatility is definitely a draw back.

yea, I'm sure .5% of the population couldn't possibly have an effect on bitcoin related servers.
