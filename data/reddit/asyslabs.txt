You shouldn't be using bills to snort drugs anyways. It's a good way to get sick. Use cut up straws and don't share them with anyone.

This \^.  Shakepay won't service rural Canadians who have a community mailbox as their official mailing address.
Support counseled me to instead to give my bank a false mailing address to create a banking statement with the fake address to give them cover for KYC requirements since they couldn't figure out how to handle a rural address.  They didn't care that the address would not be my real mailing address.

He's been found in contempt of court and having perjured himself. The judge *recommended* (to another judge) he forfeit half of his bitcoin mined during the relavent period and 50% IP and legal fees over to Kleinman.  He hasn't been ordered to pay anything yet, the case is not over.

I'll give you a hint. There's only one coin you listed that isn't a shit coin, better stick with that instead of seeking out new shitcoins.

Wait for the dip.... Wait for it.... Wait for it...
TFW the eventual dip is higher than the price when you started waiting for the dip.

Exactly why I'm inclined to believe there is illegal activity. Anyone who has a million dollars in legit money to gamble on the unregulated crypto market has the money to have lawyers handle this and in that case they probably wouldn't be complaining on Reddit begging for tweets to solve their issue.  Put me down for money laundering by OP.

Hash follows price (and cheaper electricity/improved hardware), not the other way around.

Profitability of mining is correlated with price. So when the price moves up or down more or less miners can operate profitability. This causes the hash to follow the price at least upto difficulty adjustments. 
However there are other factors, as I mentioned in my previous comment, such as hardware and electricity costs and availability. Improved asics will push the hash up just as cheaper electricity will. It's no surprise the increase in hash is happening as new asics are being manufactured.

Lmao if you have to argue with strangers online to convince people to join your cause it just makes you look all the more guilty.  In addition saying things like 


Revealing that you value money over reason and logic while getting aggressive in your defense for no reason further entrenches the appearance that you are not to be trusted.
If you can afford to gamble $350,000 usd you can afford a lawyer.

No, parabolic means exponential growth which is different from two periods of linear growth.

With over 1,000,000 usd on the line I don't know how someone *doesn't* have a lawyer ready to go.

No it's actually been growing linearly since mid May and before that it was growing linearly (with a smaller rate) since mid December, their own graph shows that.

Rip, they officially announced they ran out of funds yesterday. 'Development' will stop (ha as if there ever was any). I don't even know where to trade them, they were delisted from binance a while back after Justin revealed he had been trading (gambling) with icon funds. Coinmarketcap says they are worth about 0.01usd each.

The value in astroid mining is the material gained not price devaluation to make bitcoin relatively more expensive. This motivation makes no sense at all.
