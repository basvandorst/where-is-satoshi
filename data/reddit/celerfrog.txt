Thanks for the support.
-One more thing&gt; Above I spoke about using this as a snowball effect to start the avalanche that results in all the major international hotels accepting bitcoin. Why is this a good thing? It may also provide a hedge against local political actors attempting to target the use of bitcoin through legal means. That legal hedge would in turn protect the use of bitcoin by the local populace, which will benefit the local and global economy. I accept that may be simplistic, but I think it is still accurate. Ultimately, I think we will see the growth of a new middle class through Bitcoin...but one thing at a time.

Good Question...Here are some in response.
-Do you use the Bitcoin network to pay with Bitcoin? If yes, then the more entities that accept bitcoin will increase the health and viability of the network. If no, well, maybe it's time to get back under the bridge. 
- International Hotels are a bridge between a myriad of Nations across the globe. They engage many factors of local economies while connecting globally. Driving them to accept Bitcoin will benefit the population in areas where high inflation of the local fiat currency is already a problem. For more on this google Bitcoin Argentina and enjoy. 
- I am positive the snowball effect is in play here....once one key actor jumps on board, the others will race to join the party so as not to lose the economic and marketing advantages that come with use of the Bitcoin network. Imagine a contagion effect via the international hotels. From those nodes, it will spread to the local economies touched by those hotels, and further spread from there. It is only fear, ignorance, and complacency holding them back.
