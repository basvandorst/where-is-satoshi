If its 500b a year, then it would mean there would be 500b a year more demand for bitcoin, more demand means higher prices. If the bitcoin isn't getting transferred out to local currency there's huge potential for further growth.

Havelock is nice but by far the slowest. Also has the lowest market cap.
Create an account on all 3, btc-tc, havelock, and bitfunder. Split your investment in case of site failures or sites being taken down for what ever reason.

Can someone extrapolate the 4 year log graph by another year. Would be interesting to see when a bubble is happening.

similar to how wikipeda works?
its not 100% accurate but its incredibly efficient and probably the best we could get.

I think the correct price is $250 right now, so if it is a bubble, it's only just started. I'm thinking up to $600 maybe higher then correct to $250-$300

That's the key, to fully capture the remittance market there needs to be demand for bitcoin in the destination country. But we will probably see growth in bitcoin related businesses in these countries because of bitcoin remittance. 
First make it easier and cheaper to send money to families abroad using bitcoin, most if not all will be converting it to local currencies. As more people start receiving bitcoin, merchants will start accepting it. Less families will convert bitcoin to local currencies. Bitcoin economy grows.

Can you also do a video for brainwallets, emphasizing the quality of passwords/passphrases. To many new people to bitcoin have lost their coins because of this. Thanks for these great tutorials.

I don't like the facebook argument, to me is doesn't seem fitting. If bitcoin was closed source then maybe it would fit, but I don't see bitcoin making really bad decisions like myspace did, because its opensource and it would require the networks consensus, also the fact that bitcoin itself is a protocol makes it much harder to replace. It would be easier to build on top of it. With myspace users moving to facebook the only thing the users lost was some time. With bitcoin there would have to be a huge benefit to its users to leave bitcoin land for a different protocol, because of the potential loss to them, the users themselves are invested in the system, via money, time and businesses built around it. But if it did happen it would mean it would be such an improvement that the majority of people wont mind, me included.

Still are, but use to be as well?

I wouldn't get the loan, you must be able to save some money each week to put into btc. Its the safer option, use it as a savings account. Hold till 2016. If you didn't have a family it would probably be different.
My father in law had the same idea, I talked him out of it. He's on $120k a year with no family to support. Instead he just buys about $1000 worth each week, but leaves $1000 on the exchange in case prices fall, so he can snatch up cheaper bitcoin. Hes in it for the long run, 5-10 years.

Agreed, this product will launch almost the exact same time as Asicminers gen 3, if Asicminer come through with 0.2W/GH and $0.2/GH then KNC will have to make sure they over preform to stand a chance. Then again Asicminer usually don't compete on price.

In NZ if you deposit cash into someone's account it's instant

I can think of a single thing, growing too fast.
Scaling problems haven't been solved yet, if bitcoin grows too fast before these problems are solve it could cause all sorts of problems.

Add bitcoin as a payment option then ill be interested.
@_date: 2013-10-10 03:50:31
I really like this idea.

Because the bitcoin address and private key are made from the same passphrase and the bitcoin address is public wouldnt it be possible to crack the passphrase therefore the private key if you knew it was a brain wallet? Also would it not require a passphrase a lot longer to be secure?

I agree there is a chance it could just hover around $300 for months but the last few days we have seen almost a 10% growth each day, seems to me its a start of a bubble.
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:29:55
Wont bitcoin stabilize eventually though, when it reaches its max growth?

good luck to you sir, I've sold all my labcoin shares at .0035 to buy more AM shares at 2.0, So im hoping for asicminer to bring on the gen 2 chips sooner rather than later.
