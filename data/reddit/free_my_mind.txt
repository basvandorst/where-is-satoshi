Margin trading. If I only have nothing to invest and I believe BTC will go up 50%, I could borrow 10k from my broker, invest it all, and when BTC goes up, I sell it (close the position), get 15k, reimburse your 10k and keeps the 5k. 
If I believe the BTC price will go down 50%, I could borrow 1 BTC to my broker, sell them for 20k (short). When BTC hits 10k, I buy one for 10k and give it back to my broker. I get to keep the remaining 10k.

He got to 200 BTC by margin trading. Margin trading made him rich. How was he supposed to know when to stop? This is true that it's gambling, but it's so easy to say "he should have stopped at that point". It's like looking at the charts afterwards and saying "I should have sold there and bought here".


When you short sell, you want the market to dip. You don't want the market to recover. What the guy had was a streak of bad beats and a bad case of FUD. 
Again, I'm like you, I prefer to hodl because day trading is a full time job. Margin trading is a full time job that is super risky: you can lose it all but you can also make A LOT of money. Margin trading may be used in common stocks, but in crypto, it's next to impossible to predict any moves. Some people try and roll the dice though.

Thanks. I feel most people don't understand how margin trading works. You can make a lot of money in any direction, but you can also lose it all.

Literally every bitcoin buyer tries to buy low and sell high to a guy who is trying to do the exact same. 
The quasi totality of bitcoin 'investors' are not using bitcoin to pay for stuff but just to dump it on 'new investors' during a bull run.
If only people were willing to USE their coins to buy stuff and not just to enrich themselves...
This mentality contributes to giving cryptocurrencies a Ponzi rep and honestly, it's tough to argue against it.
edit: "sell when your taxi driver asks about bitcoin", "take profits during the bull", "wait for the next generation of suckers to start the next bull run"... How does that not sound ponzish?

Except a stock has an actual value: it's a 'piece' of a company that's making money (ideally). This piece gives you certain rights (e.g. dividends, interests, voting, etc.) 
Bitcoin only value is the one the next guy is willing to pay for it (Ponzi much?). This is why bitcoin could be worth 1 million or 100 and both of those numbers would be fair.
I'm a big fan of bitcoin for the decentralisation and monetary aspects, but the speculative element has completely ruined the markets. Nobody is using bitcoin to pay for stuff, only to get rich.
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:44:38
You're referring to a very literal definition of ponzi scheme. Most people now use the ponzi term very liberally to talk about new investors paying for the profits made by earlier investors.
Every bitcoin buyers hope to buy low and sell high, to the next "sucker" who will be trying to do the same. 
I've read around countless saying around this sub "sell when your taxi driver asks about bitcoin", "take profits during the bull", "wait for the next generation of investors to start the next bull run".
If bitcoin was mostly used to pay for stuff, that'd be great. Except it currently ISN'T. It's mainly used as a speculative instrument to get rich quick, to dump bitcoin bought for cheap on new investors. 
The fact that bitcoin only value is based on supply and demand exacerbates the whole thing. 
I'm not saying bitcoin is a ponzi, but it's currently used as one and I understand why many people think it is.
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:04:56
It's true that I should generalise like this. I would say a very vocal part of bitcoin buyers. 
And if it's a better form of money, why don't we use it as such instead of hodling it through the years?
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:25:23
Wow, that's so awesome! I apologize if my  statement was a bit bold.
I wish more people were like you, striving to use bitcoin instead of merely trying to get rich
@_date: 2019-07-08 16:39:34
No need to be sarcastic. 
If you're so intelligent, you probably know that meanings can be strict/narrow or broader. 
A ponzi scheme, in the broader sense, can be used to define any "fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors".
Now go back and read my comment instead of nitpicking on your very narrow definition.
@_date: 2019-07-08 16:50:25
True, I should have been clearer. Bitcoin value is dogmatic : as you mention, "souvereignty, uncensorability and unconfiscatability". Except that you can't express those in $.
The value of an asset can only be expressed with regard to its price. And, as you realised, price and value are not always the same (Warren Buffet: Price is what you pay. Value is what you get) but they try to be.
With a company generating profit, value can, to an extent be calculated, because of its development, financials, milestones, etc. Value is never perfectly guessed, and the price never reflects it perfectly, but it tries to. That's why you can sometimes hear "this stock is undervalued ", when talking about a stock that is selling at a price below what is assumed to be its intrinsic value.
With Bitcoin, there's no way to calculate the "intrinsic value". You can't really put a price on "uncensorability". It's a metaphysical idea. Therefore, Bitcoin cannot be undervalued or overvalued. The only value of bitcoin is what the society decides it's worth, a.k.a its price.
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:05:10
I'm sorry but your title is BS. I agree LN is great but please stay objective.
You used a channel which means you did 42 transactions with only one other address. Doing 42 transactions to 42 different addresses would cost much more.


As other people mentioned in the comments, some definitely can. Nano is free, so it definitely and virtually **can compete**. Maybe Nano has cons but costs aren't.
@_date: 2019-06-08 00:14:39


But doesn't that basically put a cap to the number of transactions? 
Also, if increasing the block size, then more transactions can be confirmed, meaning there are less blocks? In the end, how does it matter ? (to have a longer blockchain with smaller blocks than a shorter chain with bigger blocks)
@_date: 2019-06-07 23:38:37
Could you elaborate on that? How so?
@_date: 2019-06-08 09:34:23
FFS, he simply *asked* if he could pay with BTC, how is that annoying???

edit: nope, didn't happen.
@_date: 2019-06-08 00:15:37
Don't you feel it NEEDS to get bigger now? I know for a fact I avoid paying with BTC when I can because it's too expensive and takes too long to confirm.
@_date: 2019-06-08 15:36:25
Sorry, I didn't know the right terminology. I'm still trying to learn and I didn't want to offend anyone!

@_date: 2019-05-27 17:17:03
I hate this kind of posts, honestly. 
NO ONE, I repeat, NO ONE can predict what Bitcoin price is going to do. 
I'm very fond of the technology and of the fundamentals, which is why I'm buying Bitcoin and trying to use it in my everyday life, but trying to persuade people that "THIS IS IT, BITCOIN WILL NEVER BE CHEAPER" is just stupid, arrogant and dishonest. 
Bitcoin price is only set by supply and demand, and nothing else. 
Maybe it's going to go up, I sure hope and believe so, but it just might go down because this market is NOT predictable.
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:29:21
Huobi could be asked by a judge to collaborate, and choose to lie, which is very risky for 1 BTC.
Especially since the ledger is transparent and every transaction can be scrutinised. If it really is Huobi cold wallet, I don't think it would be too hard to prove it, I believe.
@_date: 2019-05-22 12:30:02
The fact that you are the top comment while making absolutely incorrect statements is very disappointing for the bitcoin community.
edit: and I'm being downvoted. You guys need to understand that using Bitcoin doesn't take you and your actions out of the legal system. Things like unjust enrichment (or thefts, and even taxation, for that matter) still exist and apply. The only problem is to be able to determine who is the new owner with certainty, which is difficult but not impossible, especially when you have a good idea and can simply ask a judge to clarify and ask the hypothetic new owner.
@_date: 2019-05-24 07:41:09
Thanks. One shouldn't be studying law to be able to discern civil from penal matters. 
So good luck... In general, you know.
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:15:03
Actually, existing law applies to cryptocurrencies, it doesn't matter what you think. Regulatory laws, regarding financial markets especially, are sometimes "confused" when it comes to tokens and bitcoin, but regarding ownership, possession and unjust enrichment, it applies perfectly well. 
An asset that you used to control and that you don't control anymore, because of one of your mistake, is still legal to claim back, if you can identify the new owner that has no legitimate cause to own it. 
It doesn't matter if "technically, you don't own the bitcoin but the private key", that's mostly and essentially about control. 
I mean, we can talk back and forth like this, fact is, OP has a clear case of unjust enrichment and I think that if one hasn't studied law, they should just avoid giving stupid advices like the ones in the thread.
@_date: 2019-05-23 05:58:33
Honestly, you seem to have become super sensitive about the matter and you have apparently no idea of how a civil case works, and about unjust enrichment claims.
In substance, you might have somme good arguments, that might be valid if Huobi is taken to court over this, which probably won't happen.  
Have a great day!
@_date: 2019-05-23 05:46:36
1. They don't need to pay back the bitcoin from the address, since bitcoins are fungible. AKA they don't need to "retrieve" the btc. 
2. They wouldn't need to do an overhaul.
3. You could try to argue that admitting it's their public address would put them at risk, but I don't think this would hold in court. Just my opinion here though.
4. You still don't know anything about the law but I think you've learned a thing or two.
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:38:27

@_date: 2019-05-22 22:39:12
This is not a penal matter, there's no prosecutor. Please stop making statements that are wrong.
It is a civil matter and you can't just stay quiet and refuse to answer.
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:58:58
Honestly, it's very clear that you've never studied the law. However, like a real lawyer, you're using technicalities ("you don't understand the technology") to prove your point.
First off, it doesn't matter if you own the bitcoin or the private key. Ownership and possession is usually about being able to "control" the object, and transfer it. With fungible and digital things, it's admissible to say that you "own" a bitcoin when it's on the public address you control through your private key.
That being said, the new public address probably has ownership over the bitcoin (it will depend on the legal system you're in and the law governing transfer of ownership). Since BTC is perfectly fungible, I would think the ownership has passed. But it doesn't mean the new owner doesn't have to repay something back.
I have studied law and the tech, and I can tell you, it doesn't matter how the enrichment took place. If someone is enriched (because he received bitcoin on his public address for example) and it can be proven that there was indeed enrichment, then you need to "indemnify" the "claimant". Obviously, no one can force you to give it back but you will have to pay the corresponding value to the plaintif. 
Not a native speaker so again, please don't pick on words.
As you mention, the biggest problem is to *prove* your claim. OP must obviously be able to prove 1) he sent the 1 BTC ; 2) without legitimate cause ; 3) to Huobi. In this scenario, OP will have to prove the public address is controlled by Huobi. While difficult, it's not impossible.
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:37:33
You are just WRONG and your example is fucking stupid!
To take your example, if I throw my car keys in your garden, I can absolutely DEMAND that you give them back. I'm not sure about the terms in english but it's something like "Property Recovery".
To take your example further, imagine I throw money (fungible) in your garden and you put it in your wallet. It has been mixed with your own money so I cannot ask for a property recovery. This is an unjust enrichment and I can ABSOLUTELY open proceedings to claim it back. 
In both cases, I will have to prove that you have my car keys and that you refuse to give them back.
Please, stop talking out of your ass when you have no idea about the law.
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:46:41
Look at my other comments. *Technically*, the owner of the new public address owns the bitcoin, but that doesn't mean that he's not *legally* obligated to give it back (if he can be identified, that is).
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:53:03
Please, google the terms I've given you. I am not trolling and I actually work in this field.
Either you can try to understand the law better, or you can just believe I'm trolling you, which will make you dumber that you already are.

"In the case of the two registrations issued to Mr. Wright, during the examination process, the Office took note of the well-known pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto,” and asked the applicant to confirm that Craig Steven Wright was the author and claimant of the works being registered. **Mr. Wright made that confirmation**. This correspondence is part of the public registration record."
Nowhere does it say they didn't recognize Craig Wright....?
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:44:14
Man, you tried. People here don't know anything about the legal repercussions of your mistake and are too stupid to admit it. 
Please, go see a lawyer. 1 BTC is still a lot of money and getting a lawyer in the mix will probably get Huobi to move their asses. Even if you only get 0.5 BTC, it is still worth it.
But I repeat, do not listen to anyone on this thread.
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:16:34
Imagine a judge asking Huobi's reprensentative: "Do you control this public address?".
If Huobi does, they can either admit it and pay it back, or lie to a judge and commit perjury. 
If they don't, they will just say no and OP will have to investigate further.
Legal case? Apparently, OP does.
@_date: 2019-05-22 07:27:01
**It's not because we're our own banks that we must be assholes to each other.** Seriously guys.
If people use their bitcoin daily, mistakes are bound to happen. Maybe *you*'ve never done a mistake and feel entitled enough to judge OP but who knows, it might just happen to you one day. We're humans. 
Telling OP to take its loss because he fucked up and he's its own bank is 1) being an inconsiderate asshole 2) wrong from a legal point of view. In many countries, sending anything to a person, especially by mistake, gives you cause to claim it back (not a native english speaker so I'm not sure those are the correct legalese): it's called unjust enrichment and it's a thing, google it.
If OP is actually certain and can prove that this wallet belongs to Huobi, they have to give it back and he could probably take them to court over it. Or Huobi could simply look into the matter, determine if this bitcoin belongs to them or not and give it back if it doesn't, keeping a certain percentage (e.g. 0.1) for the fees incurred.
No matter how it goes, OP has done a mistake and there's no one denying it. But a simple mistake is not enough to call him retarded and justify taking a loss. There's no reason Huobi should be enriched over this mistake (if it turns out it's actually their address and the transaction was indeed a mistake).
@_date: 2019-05-23 05:53:11
1. It's not because there's a clear case of unjust enrichment that I want to represent OP. Shitty argument.
2. I have indeed studied the law and cryptocurrencies, I believe you have not. That's why you should stay quiet and stop arguing about things you don't know (aka in this matter general principles of the law). You might get the tech pretty well, but you're out of your depth when it comes to legalese.
3. Legal action against Huobi is a "seasoned advice". One letter by an actual lawyer might be enough to have Huobi change their mind and only cost about 400-1k to OP, depending on where he lives.
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:26:05
Dude, you misunderstand me. 
I know exactly that nobody can reverse a transaction. It's not the point here. 
If OP manages to prove the unjust enrichment, then nobody can reverse the transaction, but Huobi can asked to repay the corresponding value (usually deducting some amount for the fees incurred). They might even have to pay it back in fiat.
It's not because the bitcoin is what is is that the law doesn't apply. Let me give you one last example:
1. You steal one of my bitcoin
2. I can prove you're the one who did it and you're the one who controls the public address where my bitcoin is now. 
3. The court won't say "THIS IS BITCOIN SO IT'S IRREVERSIBLE!". They will sentence you (penally) and order that you repay what you stole. If you refuse to send back the bitcoin, then they will make you pay otherwise (a.k.a not in bitcoin).
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:26:10
This thread is truly eye-opening. The bitcoin community is still very naive when it comes to law and regulations. 
Although bitcoin is decentralized and doesn't depend on any governments, it is considered an asset, which has value. In turn, many laws still apply regarding ownership, possession, loss, theft, taxation, etc. In this case, there's an absolute clear case of unjust enrichment, as long as what OP says is true and can be proven in court.
**"You are your own bank" does NOT mean "You are your own police and judicial system".**

@_date: 2019-05-22 12:32:33
Totally agree here. From I gather, Huobi is not responsive though. 
If it's that complicated, they could just tell him so that OP can go see a lawyer and prove its point beyond certainty. 
Since bitcoin are perfectly fungible, they wouldn't have to move the bitcoin from the cold wallet, but could give him back any other bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:10:03
I don't really know what to tell you. I will try though but I feel I've lost you a long time ago.
You can technically own something and still be obligated by law to give it back. In other words, it's not because you own something technically that you own it legally.
I'm not going to try and convince you further, I am actually an esquire and if you actually believe that receiving a bitcoin by mistake gives you the right never to give it back, then you're simply wrong.
OP made a mistake, no one's denying it, but it doesn't mean the new owner can simply keep it. The main problem, as you still seem to grasp it, is to identify them. 
It would appear that Huobi is the owner. If OP was to open proceedings, then Huobi could be asked, in front of a judge: "Do you control this public address?". If they do and say no, they would be lying to a judge which could be very detrimental if it turns out they lied.
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:49:47
That was uselessly convoluted and using terrible metaphors.
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:11:19
No, you only have to prove to a certain extent they actually do control this public address. I advise you to contact a lawyer now, because, unlike what the community is telling you, there's a clear case of unjust enrichment.
