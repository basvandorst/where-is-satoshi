Bitcoin doesn't its real value as gold or dollars do. Because your bitcoin wallet doesn't allow to identify you in the case the conflicts happen. Besides, for normal daily transactions fiat money system also can do the task so why bitcoin? Also hackers and illegal activities related in the terms of anonymity.

Stop buying. It is just bubble. People are being insane about it and ignored the fact that bitcoin is not that valuable thing for our life. Be careful!

As what I have known so far, you must wait for several confiramtions from blockchains. It takes some hours to several days.

You keep saying bitcoin is the king but please give me what kind of value bitcoin bases on? Bitcoin is only can used in transactions in which no personal identification is required like underground goods. It has no real daily use, where there are so much conflicts, and no government or orgnization can protect you in those cases. I think when more and more people join in cryptocurrencies market they will  recognise the real value of bitcoib is not that high. And the bubble will burst dramatically!!!
