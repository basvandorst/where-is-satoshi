He spent hours of frustration getting everything installed and assembling compatible versions of software.  Then he used his C programming experience to modify the code so it would actually work.
After that, boy was it easy! /s

I wasn't talking about a bcash fork, rather I was talking about a bcash-like BTC fork.

It started as a legit bitcoin subreddit that was supposed to be more lightly moderated.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:59:41
Seems reasonable when you put it like that.

I’m not moving to segwit because I don’t want to miss out on the free money from any future bcash-like forks.
It’s very likely that a future fork will not support segwit.

Lot’s of moderate income self employed people have a tax guy, who ends up serving as a financial advisor.

right there with you.

Thank you.

Algorithm absolutely does matter.
If we change to an ASIC-hard algorithm then hardware patents become a moot point.
Probably best to add a POW, rather than eliminate SHA entirely though.
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:12:19
That's a really good idea.
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:08:19
Thank you.

I develop embedded devices for a living and I agree 100% with you about this risk.

One of the big problems with a blockchain is immutability.  You can't ever fix a mistake in your records.

They would use a different address for every transaction, which would ultimately lead to a btc transaction processor, not them, so amazon transactions would not be publicly discernible.

This is a common fallacy.  When the boomers die a new crop of old people will replace them.  Old people always fight hard to protect what they have accumulated.  The next generation of old people will be even worse because they've had it so hard, and the millenials worse still when they get old.
Instead we need to reject false divisions and not engage in demographic blaming.  Which really is almost as unjust as racism.

A heat pump is almost certainly a more cost efficient method of heat a space than using resistance heaters that happen to generate a tiny income.

My laser jet 1200 is 15 years old and is as good as new.
For a while they were releasing crippled drivers to force people to upgrade but they cut that out a few years back and started releasing real drivers again for old stuff.

What the heck did that site do to my back button?

There test and scientific equipment division was top notch before they spun off agilent.

No facebook links please.  I can't see the article without logging in.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but these “market cap” comparisons that I’ve been seeing are apples and oranges and thus completely pointless.

It would still all come down to who has the cheapest electricity, but getting rid of the need for fabs and also the ASICBOOST patent woyld definitely be a good thing.

GNU and their ever more constrictive GPL is the opposite of freedom.

I think I would probably have gone with ”narrative”.
