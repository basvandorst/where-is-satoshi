and if they mitm with their quantum magic?    
or really just observe and publish a forged transaction to more nodes before you do?

A: they said Jan 1, so pretty close... just early   
B: Maybe to spread out transactions/traffic a bit?

I think a patented chip centralizes things... and I think decentralized was mentioned somewhere.    
Same with mining larger blocks eventually. Which I guess is happening anyways with the 2x part,  so...

except for 8mb blocks and proprietary asicboost chips, right?

I think changing the pow was mentioned if someone broke it... and scaling the block size... And it is scaling, and segwit increases transactions per block....     
but shatoshi isn't like, Jesus of bitcoin or something. And bitcoin wasn't conceived in a vacuum either. 
Ever heard of rpow or hash cash?      
Having a patented chip isn't a very good reason to have an altcoin, imho.
