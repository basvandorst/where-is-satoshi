Bitstamp processes withdrawals in USD and EUR. The problem is just how to avoid your GBP bank taking 3% of the transfer when they convert it. The solution IMO is open an EUR account. USD would also work, but EUR can be transferred for free via sepa whereas USD is always swift unless you have a us based USD account and can use ACH (only really possible with coinbase and Gemini and maybe only by setting it up while you live in the us).

Lightning network is kind of a proof of stake system for bitcoin. You lock btc in payment channels and then collect fees for payments flowing through them.

It probably isn't legal as a business they should be fincen registered and most likely state registered too and that imposes verification obligations. It might be legal if its for personal use only.. Either way they probably just open new accounts whenever one gets closed.

Could be the intermediary helpfully converted it into yen or usd (its unusual for a Japanese bank acct to be cad denominated) and then the destination bank converted it back to cad, both charging 2.5%. Supposedly putting the words do not convert in the memo sometimes helps. Or if there is a choice in intermedaries try the other one. But tbh, I would recommend getting a USD bank account from one of the Canadian banks that offer them and use that to communicate with bitcoin exchanges.

If you're in the us and want to use ACH there aren't a lot of alternatives anyway.

They don't.  contact coinbase support, they might be able to help you redeposit it to poloniex.
