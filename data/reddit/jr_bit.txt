So a tumble dryer exploded and caused this mess. Is that what's happening here?

There's something fishy about all this

Same may indeed refer to them as bag holders however in this context I would render that term inappropriate.

Does anyone actually know the man who coined this term on bitcointalk or do we imagine him silently admiring his impact on the btc culture?

Thanks. So if my wallet supports BIP148, will it by default also support the duplicated coins on the other chain?
And practically, how will we be able to see both balances of coins?
Also, re your last point- does sitting it out simply mean not doing anything at all i.e. no precautionary measures?

Yep. You will be free to enjoy the natural highs of life

Reason given is below. Does anyone know enough about trading to know anything about the below?!
"According to Fibonacci analysis, the way bull markets typically work is that you'll have a pullback that stops when it retraces a key percentage of a previous move higher—these key percentages all come from so-called Fibonacci ratios. One of those ratios is 61.8 percent.
So she expects this particular wave, known as the fourth wave, to last 61.8 percent of how long wave two lasted, which means the rally after the correction would start in January."
