Okay. I linked my bank account a little over 10 days ago, and the deposit was finally completed a couple days ago. So I made the purchase with the USD balance I had in the GDAX/Coinbase acct.

What was it?

I'm trying. I've been waiting for about two weeks for my Gemini account to get verified. I would def rather be using that.

Only up. :)

I think this is exactly right.

The main reason I'm using GDAX is because Coinbase fees are so high. What exactly do you mean by transfer it?

From what I've read these transactions take a long time. If a person buys some BTC during a dip, but the price rises before the transaction is complete, is the price they paid already locked in?

Do you happen to know a of reliable GDAX tutorial video by someone who knows what they're doing? Or good youtube channels for this sort of thing?

Man...I want to get started with cryptocurrency, but threads like this make me realize just how over my head all of this is.

Does it really take that long to get Bitcoin after you buy it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:34:35
How do you feel about Litecoin?

What would you consider the mark of a stabilized market?
