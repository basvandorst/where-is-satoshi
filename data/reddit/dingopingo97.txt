Amazing answer, thank you so much. One last question and sorry if this is dumb, how do i know if i have access to the private keys or not? maybe i just answered my own question. it’s an app called “blockchain-bitcoin wallet” [(itunes store link)]( still new to this, none of my family is interested in it, i’ve been trying to learn about it on my own with the help of wonderful strangers like you.

Yeah the IRS won’t be very happy with you.

Do i have to pay more fees to transfer it to there? i’ve paid so many fees transferring from coinbase, buying from coinbase, and sending to blockchain. also, can i buy off Electrum and if i can are the fees bad?

ELI5 dollar-cost-averaging?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:28:56
but with something like an Apple stock, wouldn’t it be harder to spend a constant amount each month, (or whatever time period ur buying) but w bitcoin you can say i want to spend exactly $500 every month bc u can divide it out to the 8th decimal vs having to round to the nearest whole share?

nah, eventually they ask for an ID verification, got locked out of my coinbase account. transferred it to a different app so we’re good now
