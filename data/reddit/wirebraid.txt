Hahaha, yeah, and then is when I said, "Shit, this is big".

Yes, people used to laugh like you were falling in a stupid scam. I don't blame them, you need a little backgroung in criptography, just a bit, to know how it beautifully works.

I don't have a financial background, I have a general knowledge of how things work so I've never tried to play Wolf of Wall Street because I know I would mess things up.
So I just enjoy the technical background, the implications and possibilities of it, and well, I really hope I can get something in return in the future.

It's so simple and elegant, and at the same time complex and deep, it still amazes me.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:24:26
Yeah, it's funny how you start tinkering with a cool thing and with time you realize the impact it has in real world.

Hey, we share that vision. I remember reading the paper about  Bitcoin and saying Holy sh*t, this is big, this blockchain thing is an amazing idea. I didn't know if it was going to be successful in terms of money, but it seemed something clever and fun to play with. Never started for the money, but now things are getting pretty serious.
About your Types, I recognize all of them, Type 3s are fun to watch, and Type 2s are a pain to talk to.

For me it was confidence in mathematics. I understad this is a matter of confidence, and I know there is a possible scenario where monetary value can drop, but hell, the maths will stand, that's real and it's what keeps me believing in it. My only fear with cryptocurrencies is quantum computing. I'm not sure of the consequences but I sense something could change it it goes mainstream.

Yes, there is a big difference between early adopters, who focused more in the technology, and later ones, who know Bitcoin for it's monetary value. Of course there are people who jumped in later and understand the blockchain for what it is, I'm not trying to be "Old school" here, but the difference is there.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:18:26
Yes, I also learnt something about value and confidence, and how they are related.

Courage to not fall to fear and keep the coins when correction comes. Sometimes the temptation is there. I've settled to hold till necessary, but the journey has been hard for someone like me with no finance background of knowledge. I've learnt something in the way.

I don't keep them sorry. The first one was aroun when btc hit $100 for the first time. The second one when it hit $1000. I filed the claim but I don't have much hope in getting something from it.
I also suffered a hack in a site called mybitcoinbank or something like that, I kept mi mining earnings there and lost half of it (10 coins)
Ther is a lot of info of the second mtgox hack if you search a bit

Well, that looks terrifyingly interesting. Would you say it is a maturity test for the blockchain technology?
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:17:38
Well, looks like good things. Why would it cause the price to drop?
Also, if there is a fork, does it mean there will be two blockchains?
Edit: Ok I read a bit about it, the majority of the network starts using the new branch so the old one is of no use am I right?
