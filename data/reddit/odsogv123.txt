Ginko provided commentary that was widely reported. It’s the same as an American university lecturer providing commentary. I’ve never seen an American university lecturer’s commentary reported as Fake News. This guy got smashed because he’s Russian. IMO.

Had this guy been American there would have been no fake news claims. Because he’s Russian he’s labelled a scammer. Westerners are programmed not to trust Russians. When some America guy says Bitcoin is going to 100k no one questions him.

The most interesting thing about this is he says there’s an 80 year old using a Bitcoin debit card.
