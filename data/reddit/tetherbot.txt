TBH AF you should consider if you want an alternative viewpoint. We're just going to tell you to keep stacking sats.

To be fair, they also posted the biggest losses.
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:45:23
Given the trajectory and what is known about their BCH holdings, you could extrapolate a net loss for 2018.

Impressive. Basically, for 2 people buying USD, 1 is buying BTC.

I think you both have excellent vision here, but I can't decide which is more likely. Is there a way to set up a betting market to let the people vote?

The entire price rise happened before the rate cut.

Not at all. This only presumes that miners are selfish and will include the most profitable transactions (by fee) first to fill their blocks. If the mempool empties, then even a super low fee transaction will be included. But this isn't a certainty.
@_date: 2019-10-29 23:38:37
Let's talk about dysfunction when you contemplate a world where the mempool isn't full of high-fee transactions and also there are no new bitcoin to be mined.
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:08:38
The miners choose which transactions to incorporate into a block, but the users set the fees. (The miners might not choose to incorporate the transaction for a long time, or ever, if the fees are too low.)
@_date: 2018-06-18 12:11:13
Thanks for this reply - it makes sense.

That's really stupid. Thank you for sharing.

Leaving Bittrex for Binance due to, say, fees or the Bid-Ask spread would be great. 
Leaving Bittrex for Binance because Bittrex follows the laws of the counties in which it does business seems sketchy. 
@_date: 2019-10-27 23:27:17
1. In my opinion, this is an open question.
2. Once all coins have been mined (and actually, long before then), fees are the primary incentive to continue mining.
@_date: 2019-02-19 02:46:37
If you make money from a business, you should report your income and pay your taxes, if you wish to fully avoid any consequence from breaking the law. Any other course of action exposes you to legal risk.

Surely the person who is circulating these bills with a "Buy Bitcoin" stamp wants them to be reissued.

Congrats - good choice.

Assuming that you engage in any trading activity, then current IRS interpretation is that you do have to pay taxes.
However, if you buy and do not sell or trade your BTC for anything, then I agree, you can just sit tight.
@_date: 2019-04-12 19:36:22
Because sometimes you have to pay taxes.

Without devices to perform computation, how do you plan to turn "all available energy" into BTC hashpower?
Point being, it's not \*just\* available power. There are more considerations, even for an envelope estimate.

I think 3x is a common max.

The OP's basic failure to understand the difference between shorting and selling put options is emblematic of why retail will keep losing their shirts.

Your argument is sort of like Wesley Snipes' argument that income tax is illegal. 
Like, sure, it's sort of appealing, but not paying taxes is still unlawful.

Talking US securities, since that's better traveled territory, you can't sell and then immediately buy back just to recognize a loss. That is a wash sale. You have to wait at least a month before buying back, if that is your goal.

This is dumb. 
Many people had the idea of digital cash for years before Satoshi figured out how to *implement* the idea. 
The idea alone isn’t bitcoin.

Dollar cost averaging has lower returns, but also lower variance, when compared to buying in up front with a lump sum.

Much more likely, this is a short squeeze driven by Bitmex and Bitfinex shooters getting liquidated.

Why not? If you extrapolate out the growth trend, it could fit what we are seeing 5 years later.
