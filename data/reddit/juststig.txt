I think you have a point here, which is that there might be a significant portion of users who would not be helped by LN because most/all of their transactions are in one direction only, like a merchant in your example. If you are only receiving, you'd need to constantly ask to open more and more channels with funds locked by your counterparties, which naturally incurs costs with unknown but potentially significant cost. What if the tx fee settles to 10 or 20 dollars like it was just a few months ago?
Likewise for a user who'd only spend his hard-hodled Bitcoins, he'd keep opening up new channels for some chunks he's comfortable keeping in his hot online wallet. LN would not really help that user either.

What do you think, will cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin especially become commonly used by normal people so that most of our money transactions, including receiving salary like in the OP, are eventually handled in blockchain? Or would cryptocurrencies remain in some niche usage, for example as a better digital money for internet payments?

Just a quick note, because I've seen this claim that governments control money a few times in a short period now. They don't, central banks control money supply, and they're independent in many places from political influence or even oversight. Really, money supply is controlled by bankers who are not accountable to anyone. It's much worse than just governments being in control. That's why cryptocurrencies have the potential to disrupt and ultimately even free us from being banker slaves.
