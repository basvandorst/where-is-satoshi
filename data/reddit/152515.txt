I don't think you understand what "investment" means. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 14:18:55
Both parties have to consent to the neutral chosen, and can submit requests for certain arbitrators or arbitrators with specific case knowledge or expertise. Additionally, the AAA isn't the only professional arbitrators organization. 
Arbitration isn't perfect, but for a subreddit that prides itself on combating FUD about bitcoin this has been a lot FUD about arbitration. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 15:17:21
Fair enough, I believe you. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:15:08
The NAF stopped taking new cases in 2009. It was never a legit agency. There are numerous other arbitration agencies that are vastly more reputable, the AAA being the most prominent. All times to get decisions are incredibly shorter than courts. All the legal fees are paid BY THE COMPANY/EMPLOYER, following AAA rules. Consumer/employee win rates are comparable to courts. 
Companies don't "hide" arbitration any more than they "hide" any other part of their TOS. They don't advertise it as a benefit because of people like you mindlessly bashing them for it. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 08:27:26
It would be a conflict of interest if arbitrators operated independently. However, arbitrators operate in organizations, like the AAA. To begin an arbitration procedure, it's the AAA, not the company, that selects arbitrators. Usually a list of names is produced, and the eventual arbitrator being mutually agreeable to both parties. The customer can veto arbitrators they perceive to be biased. The AAA has a vested interest in maintaining neutrality, as this is the main reason they are sanctioned by law and by courts to perform their function. 
Should people be more aware of arbitration? Yes. Is that a reason to knock it? No. Read the TOS if you're that concerned about it. It's not like you're forced to accept them. 
There's pretty good evidence that arbitration actually reduces the repeat player advantage that courts give. This is because of the relative informality and lack of strict evidentiary standards that your sources deride. But they have it backwards. Who is more likely to use arcane court procedure and discovery methods to their advantage - the customer, or the company with an army of lawyers? 
@_date: 2015-06-13 14:25:25
Haha, thanks. I'm currently in training to be a professional neutral, so the insinuation that all arbitrators are just in the pockets of corporations really bugs me. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 05:08:56

@_date: 2015-06-13 14:06:26
But that's exactly how it works now.... That's what I just described.
@_date: 2015-06-13 06:12:50
My graduate degree is in arbitration. You're fear mongering, the system isn't perfect but it's nowhere near as bad as you're making it out to be. Much, much more individual-friendly than court would be. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:19:03
You can't legally unilaterally reneg on a contract to make a new one. Even if it were the case that there was a "broad context of forming a new contract" that made their suggestion legal, it's still ethically reprehensible.
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:16:39
This makes no sense. Please explain, in specific terms, how OKCoin's communications indicate anything other than an intent to deceive. They straight up advocate money laundering. That's not cultural difference, that's breaking the law. It's a scam, they should be avoided at all costs. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 00:46:45
It falls under the same laws. Would "financial crimes" be more accurate? 
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:26:31
None of which okcoin had cause for. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:19:47
Where in the emails is a new contract specified? Why would a new contract not be equally shady? 
@_date: 2015-05-25 18:42:10
Why would an increased block size reduce the supply of fees? Fees pay for priority, not for inclusion. Just like blocks currently aren't filled a larger block wouldn't be filled. Same fee demand/supply as today.
@_date: 2015-05-24 00:46:12
It's illegal? 
@_date: 2015-05-24 00:50:26
Sigh. I can tell you have no legal background. Unconscionable contracts have nothing to do with this. Paying someone for a domain name and service is a perfectly legitimate activity. As to the "different entities" argument, okcoin was honoring the contract for three months. Why would they do that if they weren't the entity that signed the contract? That's damming in a court. Okcoin's "new contract" didn't have Ver's digital signature, not a valid contract. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 18:29:45
How would increasing the size cause failure? I don't see anyone disputing that we're reaching the block size limit now. Reaching that limit is catastrophic. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 19:09:15
But... competing for inclusion is bad...
@_date: 2015-05-18 14:02:14
Again, isn't that requiring a trusted third party? 
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:04:00

Oh you're a troll, got it 
@_date: 2015-05-23 21:09:25
No, avoiding regulations by conceding the recipient. It's a violation of US law and Singaporean law. Don't know about Chinese. That doesn't matter though, as proposing a deal that would be illegal for Ver to accept is really shady. Additionally, it would likely violate trade agreements causing any future okcoin business in the US to be illegal. Further, if they really are incorporated in Singapore as they claim, they couldn't legally do that.
@_date: 2016-01-03 02:46:35
But why does it take time? Seems trivial to push an update. Maybe adoption takes time, but does it really take this long to code it? Hasn't this been an issue for months? 
@_date: 2015-05-18 13:48:08
Isn't confirmation time over ten minutes though? It seems like you're talking about directly sending bitcoins to the merchant, whereas the reply above mentions using other programs. Which is it?

So what kind of block size increase does core support? I was under the impression that they supported no increase right now.

Everything he said seemed accurate to me. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:12:28
That is literally money laundering. How is that not a big deal? 
Why did the emails say that OKCoin's lawyer was using Google translate? Why was the "lawyer's" response in Chinese if he spoke English?

First, because people click on things they don't understand all the time. 
Second, because one party in a transaction would demand it. 
Basically, the reasons the guy you originally responded to said. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 04:50:01
As an outsider, I have to ask. Why? 
@_date: 2016-01-26 06:26:36
OK? I've tried all the top options there, and they don't work. Coinbase wants a bank account. Circle won't let me buy bitcoins. Can't even register with CoinCorner (they want an "occupation", I'm a student). Local Bitcoins won't search my area and has no "cash" option. Which one would you suggest?
@_date: 2016-01-01 11:28:41

@_date: 2016-01-26 06:31:31
Ok, I'm on the Circle website. I made an account, verified it on my phone. Now, where is the "buy bitcoins" option? All I see for options are "Account", "Transactions", "Send money", and "Request Money". 
@_date: 2016-01-02 06:30:31
Not trying to argue, but legitimately curious. Why do you say that Core supports decentralization? It seems to me like they are acting as a centralized authority on what Bitcoin is. Am I getting the wrong impression? 
@_date: 2016-01-01 11:22:08
So by that definition, gold isn't cash, right? 
@_date: 2016-01-26 06:11:53
Ok, I'm on localbitcoins. Where is the cash option? I see "cash deposits" and "cash by mail", but no "cash". Additionally, I see no way to search locally! Every search I enter seems to be giving me all results for the US, even when I type in my city first. 
@_date: 2015-05-18 13:07:32
I don't understand half of those words. Does that mean paying with bitcoin requires a trusted third party? Doesn't that defeat the purpose? 
@_date: 2016-01-26 06:41:55
Will I then be able to send BTC to another address from the circle app? I'll try that, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:10:37
That attitude is the problem. I remember when the Bitcoin community was helpful, idealistic, and generally happy. Not anymore. Now it's all "me first".

? this thread is about block size increases, not the s2x fork
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:09:16
I guess. I had high hopes for BTC, but everyone on here is telling me to leave. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:55:41

@_date: 2017-11-19 06:13:04

@_date: 2017-11-07 19:35:20
Are you just reading a different thread? One guy says the opposition is to s2x, not a block increase in general. Then someone else says that block size increases are ok as long as they are thoroughly tested. Someone then asks why block size increases aren't being tested. Someone else diverts the conversation back to "s2x is bad". 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:32:04
Well, that wasn't the response I was expecting, but OK. I guess I'll leave. So much for promoting adoption.

@_date: 2017-11-19 04:08:23

@_date: 2017-11-07 21:37:44
Man, that sucks for me then. All I want to do is buy like $50 worth a week. Not worth it if 10% of that is fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:10:19
The guy I was responding to said that I shouldn't. How can I use bitcoin with fees that are prohibitively expensive? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:38:17
I want to use bitcoin, not speculate on price. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:09:38
Well, that sucks. Guess I'll just wait until Bitcoin figures out how to scale. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 07:58:10
I travel abroad about ten times per year, never have any problems. That's just my experience, though. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 05:01:45
Do you think visa would have survived as a payment method if it decided to not process certain transactions
@_date: 2015-07-01 07:59:19
It's different because one is a structural feature of the system and the other is a conscious political choice. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 08:13:32
Sure, these particular transactions are clearly spam. But what happens when it's not so obvious? What is the threshold for what qualifies as spam and what doesn't? Why does the technology make that choice and not individual users? I understand that excluding transactions is the prerogative of miners, but think about it from a user perspective. What if an email client didn't send or receive messages it thought was spam? While in most cases that might be a good thing, what about the important messages it misses? 
It's a dangerous precedent for the community to be totally fine with large numbers of transactions going uncompleted, regardless of the specifics of this case 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:09:26
Literally all that matters to me is fees. If it costs more than a dollar, I'm not going to use it. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:14:48
Yeah. That's terrible, and judge advantage for bitcoin
@_date: 2015-07-01 07:10:05
Qualitatively different, and you know it. When I swipe a credit card at a store, that transaction isn't going to just disappear and not be processed because the network is under heavy load. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 08:06:24
As I said to the other guy who responded here, that's different for so many reasons. One is a political choice, the other is a feature of technology. It's also different temporally- visa was well established when they did that. My point is that alternative payment methods never simply ignore transactions as a feature of their technology. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 05:12:36
Isn't a better system where fees give priority rather than being a prerequisite for inclusion at all? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:37:12
That's on top of the $2 per transaction fee that coinbase charges, right? 
@_date: 2015-07-01 07:57:30
No, I don't see visa doing that. Which is exactly why I want Bitcoin to be different. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 09:49:46
Couldn't any buyer just repeatedly double spend without any consequence? Why wouldn't that be rampant? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:26:17
Other people in this thread describe segwit as allowing for third party non-bitcoin networks to take over. Shouldn't we try to stop that? 
@_date: 2015-04-12 07:41:10
So how can bitcoin ever work for day to day transactions? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:34:48
Which is which? Both sides seem to say that about the other. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:34:22
Doesn't segwit increase the block size though? So why do we want that? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:58:27
So, is the part about bigger blocks causing mining centralization not true? 
Put simply, are bigger blocks (2MBish) good or bad? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:55:15
Isn't segwit signaling at like 30% though? That's gotta be more than one person opposed.
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:16:14
Sure, block size increases alone won't work forever. But won't it work for a long time? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:21:17
I do want scaling. That seems necessary to decrease transaction fees. So, it seems like a good way to prevent bitmain from getting their way is to support increasing the block size to 2MB. Thanks for all your help! 
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:10:26
Bitmain is a company that makes mining equipment, right? And you say they oppose increasing block sizes? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:00:46
Huh, I didn't know there were that few miners. If you're right and one guy controls 70% of the mining power, can't he just do a 51% attack and take over? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:32:01
Isn't the point of bitcoin that I don't have to trust "them" with my money? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:36:01
No, please explain. 
Is this person wrong?  (Last paragraph): 
 
Here's the quote I'm referring to:
What's segwit? It's adding an additional fingerprint (hash) to every block. It's good for a lot of reasons. see the most important is that it enables layering of cryptocurrency solutions on BitCoin. (Which will enable smaller networks to live on top of the big bitcoin blockchain. Those smaller networks can have veeery different rules, but they can still provide the global guarantees of bitcoin when they interact with the btc blockchain. (Basically using btc as a clearinghouse for smaller/faster/cheaper networks.))"
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:33:18
How do you know those numbers? Are their surveys? I thought there was no majority, that's why nothing has happened yet. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:38:08
Why would I believe you? What OP wrote looks about accurate from what I've seen... And you aren't bothering to explain why it's wrong. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:52:50
You just said "Segwit increases the on-chain block sizes by more than double". Right now, block size is 1MB. So, Segwit causes more than 2MB blocks, right? What am I missing? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:54:08
If the problem is that transactions are too expensive, I don't understand why the solution seems to be giving up on using bitcoins for transactions. Sure, that technically solves the problem, but... Then it's not bitcoin, right?

So, lightning network basically keeps track of back and forth transactions, adds them all up, then transfers bitcoin to match the end result? 
I think I understand that. My question, then, is how trust works in that system. If the individual transactions are not verified on the bitcoin chain, what makes this system different from a bank? Do I have to trust whoever owns the lightning network to accurately record and process transactions? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:13:49
Why would I want to trust a non-bitcoin payment network? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:10:59
Ok, I can rephrase my question then. If lightning is responsible for determining who owns how much wealth, why is bitcoin a part of the process at all? Let's say I have one bitcoin. I want to send it to someone else. Right now, I use the bitcoin chain to do that, right? With lightning, am I no longer using that chain? 
A second question - are lightning transactions public? If not, isn't that one of the big fractures of bitcoin being lost? 
I'm not trying to troll. I genuinely don't know. You're being super helpful, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:42:58
Bitstamp requires photo proof of my residence status - I don't have any way of getting this, as I live in an apartment and don't pay utilities. 
Cex.io requires the same thing, or Visa or Mastercard (I have a Discover card). 
Coinmama "does not offer services in my area".
Any other ideas? Thanks for trying to help. It feels really discouraging to try to buy bitcoins for a week and fail. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:48:13
So, segwit wants bigger blocks than the other proposals? I thought bigger blocks are bad, and caused mining centralization. Or is that wrong? 
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:13:22

Why isn't it an answer? If there isn't enough room for all transactions, why not allow more transactions?

As someone who admittedly knows relatively little about the tech, I've yet to hear why segwit/LN tech won't lead to centralized hubs for payment channels.

Of course I did that. I don't keep any coins on coinbase. But there's no alternative for buying more.

So, the choice seems to be between centralized miners or centralized payment hubs. I don't like either option.

So, I should just trust that someone will innovate a way to keep bitcoin transactions p2p? And in the meantime, I should accept high fees if no LN alternative appears? I don't know. Maybe that's the wrong interpretation of what's happening, but it seems accurate from what I've read.  
@_date: 2017-06-22 06:42:05
Exactly. That's the point I'm making. The risk is low.

Just like accepting cash or personal checks, there is a counterfeiting risk in accepting payments. Companies do it now, they can do it with bitcoin.

No, they don't. Not immediately, anyway.

? Users have no ability to "orphan" miners without overwhelming consensus.

That seems a bit harsh.
