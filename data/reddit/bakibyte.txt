The real transaction cost in bitcoin is $ 67, you pretend that banks are hiding fees, but the real transaction cost in bitcoin is also hidden, and when miners receive income only from the commission and provided that mining costs do not increase, then with the current hashrate  You will have to pay $ 67 per transaction.  You also do not take into account that no one receives a salary in bitcoins, which means that everyone will inevitably have to buy bitcoin first and pay a large commission for the purchase, then to pay for goods you will have to sell bitcoin and again pay a large commission.  So the real price of money transfer is very high and it will also take a lot of time.  In the future, the transaction price will rise even more and only very rich people who are not afraid to pay $ 100 per transaction can use Bitcoin, as well as central banks and banks will start to store bitcoins instead of gold and transfer billions of dollars spending all $ 100 or even $ 1000, but  for them it is nothing.  So the question of becentralization with such high commissions and costs remains open.

I do not see protection from an attack by a state such as the USA.  See for yourself if a large state starts its own asic production simply at the expense of taxes or subsidies, it will be paid by the people of this state and the costs will be transferred from the authorities to the people.  Now let's say you made a hard fork and changed the algorithm to another, but hey, what equipment will be used?  Video cards, processors?  But then the state uses supercomputers or builds a mining farm on video cards.  In this case, what does each person have, which the state does not have?  asic, video cards and processors will be with the state and it will be paid from taxes forcibly, the argument will be as usual for security.
