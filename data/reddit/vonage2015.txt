Hi DUILawDoge,
Alex Green (CEO of moolah) isn't himself on the Dogecoin Foundation Board.  
Instead and just as good, he has an employee of his working as a moderator on r/dogecoin which enables him to be able to delete any post that is slightly negative, even if 100% factually correct. The employee that is a moderator on r/dogecoin is moolah use to have in his pocket as well.  Although she wasn't officially employed by moolah, they made arrangements via an IRC chat for her to do "TROLL MANAGEMENT" in exchange for him lending her his "SEC DEV" guy.  Turns out Alex Green himself was the "SEC DEV" guy. So he worked for her on whatever she was putting together and she deleted anything that questioned moolah's business practices. 
fortunately was **removed** yesterday as a moderator on r/dogecoin (I won't go into details in this post as to why - PM me and I will explain, it was pretty bad stuff). 
As an aside, and you'd find this funny as an attorney yourself.  claimed to be an attorney, which I believe she shared with you.  Interesting though is that she resides and allegedly practices in New York and has "3 Master's degrees and a variety of lesser degrees". I'm certain that you know where I'm going with that statement.  A person in NY is claiming to be a practicing attorney, but has 3 Master's degrees and a variety of lesser degrees???? As an attorney yourself, I'm sure that you know that there's something missing there. 
Even funnier, sent out a picture on IRC of "herself". The picture was of a girl with 6 pack abs.  Well someone that she pissed off by deleting their post under her favorite catchall "FUD", did some digging and found out that is actually about 300 pounds (maybe 350) with the matching neck-beard and all.  
This is just one example of the individuals associated with moolah.
