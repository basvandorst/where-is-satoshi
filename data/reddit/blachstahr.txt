Hey now, Bitcoin has drugs. They were the only thing propping up the price for so long /s ;)

Reading comments here reminds me of silkroad at its collapse. Two years ago the comments were fewer but more intelligible.  As the number of subscribers increase to reach the broader user, the comment quality decreases. It's shows general increase in exposure, a good thing but at cost.  Post view of btc could have taken place today, last month, or 6 months ago. Same cycles just more subscribers. All the same, just new day. I'm glad we're still making some progress though.

He's helping the rest of you realize how much us non Republicans hate that piece of shit here in Alabama. Can't decide who we would like to see killed by thousands of paper cuts more in Alabama. At the present Trump and Sessions are tied but come midterm elections Moore might come back for first place. Many of us are sensible people.

more micro transactions to process, creating more lag

Since Silkroad does not publish the amount of products sold, I think it's unfair to use them as a comparison.  It's a black market, it's purpose has never been to provide for growth of Bitcoin.  The value of Bitcoin has little effect on its user base because they buy coins and then buy their goods. If Silkroad started accepting only Litecoin, I don't think the value of Litecoin would rise.  Silkroad shouldn't be used as means to compare growth because their sole purpose is to change money to Bitcoins and Bitcoins into drugs.  Bitcoin just happens to be their accepted currency.

The price comparison that is used to compare Bitpay and Silkroad is outdated.  That doesn't make the amount any less impressive for economy growth.  At this point, I don't believe anything has surpassed Silkroad.
