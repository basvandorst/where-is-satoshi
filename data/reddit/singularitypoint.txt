One book shelf is entirely dedicated to Hamilton currently, He may not be the best technical writer but his story's are always captivating.
I recommend you pick up the Mandel trilogy great series. The Nights dawn series as well.

I have to deal with Rabobank through work, they are nothing but a pain in my ass, the day i stop dealing with these people will be a happy day.

The Hyperion cantos is a great series, it shares common points with Hamilton's world in the commonwealth books. and the use of John keats in the the simmons books is fantastic. Richard Morgans Kovach series is also good.  I would also read Forever war by Joe Halderman.  I will be clearing out some of my older books at the end of this year and was going to give some one through reddit secret santa and other stuff so if there is anything you would like to read see if i have it. and ill see what i can do.

Its been said, but this will end with the person sending amounts to random wallets and these people thinking wow what good luck, cashing out and a witch hunt happening.

The merchants are all cashing from the weekend, people are panic selling and some of us are picking up some cheapish coin :) so thanks for that, bitstamp went to 800 and i grabbed some then, its now back to around 930-940

He is a very good author but i still prefer the likes of Hamilton, Reynolds and the now late Banks.
