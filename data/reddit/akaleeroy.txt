This is appalling. I wanted to quote something like 


but the fact that this isn't even about a pot of stew, but about heating AIR, ALL THE AIR in the space... made me freeze and need a reboot.

I found a guy that isn't overpriced on LocalBitcoins - [lastbit]( Bucharest, Romania.
I don't think it's the best option to meet up and pay with cash, you could get ripped off. But it's an alternative to websites and bank transfers.

Haha, nice one!
Glad to see the subreddit theme in action (I'm the guy who designed it). I was thinking about proposing a video too, since this is the standard way to explain things nowadays. Great job, very comprehensive!

Yeah, well... Fingers crossed that the rise of the global south burns through the stages to enlightenment fast enough. Emphasis on *burns*.

Has anyone noticed that bitcoin24 EUR has been fluctuating like crazy [14:38 GMT 11 Apr 2013]? 5EUR in the space of 1 minute, 6 serious peaks and troughs per hour. 
'Tis a very bumpy ride, what's going on there?

Shameless plug - for Tolkien fans, just made a "skin" for bitcoinpaperwallet.com

I'll give you one better, no QR, no NFC, no devices on you at all, just a brain wallet.
Then you could buy things even while having a ["fugue state"]( naked at the grocery store.

Unleashing human potential is very much to be desired, but it's only one side of the coin (excuse the pun). The flipside is that humans are physical beings inhabiting a single planet, and you can't infinitely grow the economy out of step with the rate of energy and resource depletion. These are the things that give wealth value. If you make up a lot of fictional digital wealth for everyone and then they all go out and get real stuff with it... you're gonna have a bad time.
Say you were a 3rd world inhabitant who suddenly became a Bitcoin millionaire. You'd probably get a new car, a new house, gadgets, eat more and buy more plastic-wrapped goods. If we unleash human potential to create new wealth for more people, under the current system that will mean a seriously aggravated environmental burden. In a way it would mean that everyone will actually be worse off, paradoxically.
A possible long-run solution to this predicament is to consider what sustains our lives and bring money and wealth back into the realm we inhabit, back into Nature, by giving it natural properties. For instance, attaching the value of currency to energy expenditure, or making money spoil just like food does. Such things are however so leftfield for mostly everyone that it will take some big changes aroun' here before such solutions catch on.
