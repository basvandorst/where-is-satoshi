I think people try to deflect when they are losing a debate when the term 'whataboutism' was invented. But historically Socialist, Marxist and Communist governments (even the US drifted towards this in the 20's before conservatives decried it. Only Margaret Sanger was able to sustain the movement) categorizes people who have 'value' and who does not. Gypsies, mentally 'defective,' 'racially impure' etc. people are therefore non-persons and are eliminated by either sterilization, lobotimization, 'euthanization' or straight up 'cleansing.' I know Europeans who came to America are accused of doing this to native Americans - and yes they did - although it was not the pure intent of most leaders of the government. It became the inadvertent defacto outcome although there was significant outcry from the informed public. Capitalism does not advocate exclusively for doing what you propose. Even Keynesian economics makes provision for charitable acts as a spontaneous action of a healthy economy.

I didn't check the source, just tell me if it references 'economies of scale'?

And apathy by the general public.

In Socialist countries they are often 'culled.'

Yep, no surprise when you have an agenda to promote instead of using commonly accepted concepts.

Upvoted for fundamental truth. From there the discussion seems to either advance or spiral into tribalism.

Yep, thanks to **CAPITALISM**.

Or is this more clever than that? By disbursing this currency among new adopters, does it increase the value? The idea is if you circulate it more, it displaces other forms of currency, and because of it's nature it is used outside the purview and control of banks and governments? This may be a clever way to multiply his own remaining wealth at worst, a way to disrupt the current grip on money and control of economies at best!
I'm all for it after the 'created' disasters that the governments and banks have levied on consumers in recent years. Bitcoin is better than the barter system that got a little press a few years ago, and distributing rather than hoarding will lessen the chance of the bubble bursting and rendering the currency worthless.
