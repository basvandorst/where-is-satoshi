Not sure today is the best day to pitch bitcoin.

It's good that you're happy about losing money, because you will continue to with that approach. If you're not taking profits during a parabolic rise then you're a fool.

You posted this 1 day ago: [Call me cynical, but the crash ain't coming until exchanges and coin purchase deposits execute in a timely manner.](
1 day after pronouncing "the crash ain't coming" BTC crashes.
You're in over you're head.

Bitcoin may ultimately look like that classic phase chart but the timeframe comparison is off. If anything BTC is on the way to bull trap, but it's not down there yet.
(My two cents. I don't own, nor have ever owned BTC. I'm happy to watch all of this on the sidelines)

Have you owned BTC at all or are you just watching from the sideline like I am?

Applying dollar cost averaging to something this volatile is a ridiculous ~~strategy~~ notion. With a parabolic move on any investment, if you're not taking profits you're a fool.

THAT'S WHY YOU TAKE PROFITS!!!
But you're right, I'm wrong. Taking a 60% loss is a great idea.

That's the straight up big boy truth.

I hear what your saying, but doesn't the "...have to look back to the 1700's" undo your whole opinion though. Comparing BTC to anything pre-internet is silly.
Ultimately, it will take a week or so to see where BTC is comparatively to that chart.
Take a look at the [current live BTC chart]( There's no way it's down to a bull trap yet.

cantbearsed is right. Nothing wrong with asking the question, but it's true that if you have to ask on an internet forum about timing your first purchase now... then now is not the time for you. Do more research, sit on the sidelines and watch/learn. Find a higher probability entry.
