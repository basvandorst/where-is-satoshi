I hear people saying go buy now that the price is low or don't buy it's going to go even lower or oh no the market is crashing! From what I can tell from your comments and questions many of you are new to cryptocurrencies and are looking to make a bit of money and some actually interested in it. Regardless of what category you're in, you should do your own research, don't rely on a random guy sitting behind a screen to tell you what to do! What makes you think they know best? Why trust your hard earned money to some guy you don't know? Do your own research so as to make informed decisions and you will soon realise most people have no idea about what they are talking on these forums! To help you out I will share two links one is on cryptocurrencies in general and the other is about bitcoin futures that are changing the market. They are both great starting points! 1.

Long-term holding is important but you need to know when to sell and to do that you must do your research!

This article on OTC Markets, which can be found here  I think its quite an insightful article as it really shows you the size of cryptocurrency markets and not just what we believe it is from the figures given from Coincapmarket. The cryptocurrency market is at least double in size considering that the OTC Market for Crypto is bigger than that of traditional exchanges. What are your thoughts? Can this lead to market manipulation?
