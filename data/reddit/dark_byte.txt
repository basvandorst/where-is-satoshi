I can't wait till people have to pay me money for me to take their bitcoins, and then just hold
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:10:11
scientific research funded by banks has proven that bitcoin gives you cancer.
Also, there are reports that bitcoin are being produced by slave labour of small children doing calculations by hand
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:52:56
miners just don't process low fee transactions below a certain amount at all.
so if there are no transactions higher than that then they'll rather not do any transactions at all so the average fee does not drop
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:49:19
It's a matter of statistics.
Sure, the low frees get eventually mined and they lose money, but the time for those to get mined is small, and the time that the fees are high is longer (especially if they have a high mining power) so in the end they will make a profit

with a bit of luck the 'over 9000' memes can be used again
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:28:41
Still waiting for my 25 sats/byte transaction from last month to go through lol
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:28:14
I wish I had bought bitcoin during the time of MT GOX (even before it went down)
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:48:15
Exactly like a lottery.
What miners basically do is pick lottery numbers and check if their number is a winning number.
Sometimes they win on the first draw, but more often it takes about 10 minutes to pick a winning lottery number.  (And sometimes even longer)

it's been under 10k for quite a while for us euro users. (good thing the USD plummeted so badly so it doesn't look that bad for you guys )

Just print a paper wallet, put a little money on it, put it in a birthday card and send it to them with a note: This card contains some bitcoin. Do with it what you please

i hope he dies soon
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:40:44
yes, just because i want to see people panic when they misread it and think bitcoin crashed to $16.95
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:00:53
is there anything in place that stops miners from submitting countles of transactions to themselves with low transfer fees artificially pumping up the lowest confirming fee ?
@_date: 2019-07-15 05:21:12
i'll start buying again at 6270 
@_date: 2018-08-06 06:48:00
not if it caused him to panic sell and only got back in late december last year
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:15:39
Less mining just means it will be made easier to mine bitcoin so the supply will stay the same. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:52:44
predictable would be it it had gone to 6100, this is more than expected.  (so expect a drop next week)
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:47:31
it wasn't a pump
all other currencies in the world just dropped at the same time
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:04:22
they should make a blockchain sourcecode repository and put it on there
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:41:44
at the bottom of the 3th loop many people will kill themselves because the drop in value is too big for them

slow compared to opening a playboy magazine
a playboy magazine you just open it and see naked women.  with the internet you'd had to wait 5 minutes to see the image fully.
@_date: 2018-06-20 06:25:18
back then the internet was still free and unregulated.  Nowadays you have mandatory  cookie and privacy popups and are quite limited what you can and can't do
not a good future for bitcoin if you ask me
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:12:19
Miners will quit, difficulty goes down, and people with normal hardware will be able to do confirmations
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:16:35
I wonder when ACash will be created
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:32:11
This is why bitcoin has gone down in price
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:32:30
sure, just pay what you can lose though. e.g if folding up a $100 bill and smoking it doesn't make you panic, then go ahead and buy $100 in bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:19:42
then it will be the '2 years ago' argument
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:27:06
That's why I also bought one of those and stuffed it in my airtight safe. Will be a great investment in a decade or so
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:39:17
after it drops to $300 it will gradually go up back to $3000 (so 10x improvement on your investment) before the next crash
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:45:35
my guess 2500 based on a 2 year view and ignoring the hype
@_date: 2019-01-08 11:59:26
Rich people have the money above 100k invested in stocks. 
and sure if they invested in a banks they'd lose some but most will have invested in yellow vest manufacturers or related lol
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:05:38
But how else do we stop/slow the dip?  We need people to buy bitcoins to keep the price up so we have time to sell it before it completely collapses
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:05:25
it's time to get the pants

attack the person with the gun until one of you is dead
once word gets out all bitcoin owners are suicidal hodlers they'll learn not to do that
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:15:16
Was it ever stable ?

That's a thing? I've been powering my miners by burning forests
@_date: 2018-07-13 09:49:52
automated using an api and a computer/server that runs a small script
every 24 hours it checks if the order has  been met, and if not, cancels it, and place one 100 more.
if it has been met, place a new one 1000 less
@_date: 2018-07-13 17:48:34
Just hoarding atm. I do want some bitcoin in the far future and this protects me from buying too expensive during times of hype
@_date: 2018-07-13 08:01:31
my buy order rises 100 a day until bought and then drops by 1000 and repeats like that
@_date: 2019-09-24 06:38:51
Easily explained: Craig Wright is actually Corrado Böhm
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:26:14
same here, did a transaction with 50sat/byte, and it took 4 hours for the first confirmation
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:47:49
I just worry what happens when the amount of money you get from mining and transaction fees becomes less than the amount of money spent on electricity.
will there be anyone left to confirm our transactions?
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:41:57
you can try waiting a week. usually after a spike like this there will be a drop with the exact same amount a few days later. (though perhaps this does give it the push to stay over 9000)
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:50:26
good thing south africa will never do such things...
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:20:03
time to sell
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:41:45
now would be a good time
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:27:08
low: 200
high: 8500
