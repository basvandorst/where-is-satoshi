i guess I was impressed with their webpage, then I was browsing for media attention, and realize they got some hits... So I thought I share.  Do you think it will be just like the rest?

hmmm.. didn't know they got a community here... I read some of their posts.. they seem like an aggressive group trying to get things going.. I wonder will they succeed.  They do look like they are better than most of the alts.. but what do I know.

I heard that's a huge global scam by chinese buyers?  You should check the website... I cannot take it seriously...

well if u can't laugh at yourself.   I still can't tell are you serious about dogecoin being a scam or not, cause the price and volume is dropping like a rock now, hope you didn't invest any.

Interesting indeed, thanks for sharing. Looks like the Wallet Jäger are on the loose again.

I do see the serious competition.. quite a developing market.  Though I find it strange how Dogecoin manage to get people to take it seriously, that alone vexes me to no end.
