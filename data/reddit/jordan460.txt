I graduated college with massive debt, but it's not that hard to pay off because I have a job
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:39:24
No. I pay all of those things and pay the minimum on my student loans. Never owned a credit card. Cost of living here might be cheaper than where you're referring to, though.

@_date: 2017-10-20 15:37:19

@_date: 2017-10-20 14:34:10
