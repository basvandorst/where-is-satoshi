Look at it this way (I expect I'll get downvotes for this in the subreddit, but it's worth speaking my mind).
Bitcoin is its own entire currency.  In order to send Bitcoins over the internet, you first have to get your USD or Euros or whatever it might happen to be converted to Bitcoins first, and then in order to get Bitcoins to be useful, you either have to use one of the handful of merchants online that accept Bitcoins, or convert them into USD first (the latter of which most people do).  There is a reason why Mt. Gox handles over 50% of all transactions: Bitcoin are mostly only useful for investment because of the complete lack of widespread acceptance.
Paypal currently does dealings in many worldwide currencies with USD being one of the most popular ones.  In the US, most people are only interested in trading USD for items, and as it so happens, USD is what most people in the US have.  They can just pay a nominal fee in USD to send their money to someone else.  They don't have to convert their money to/from a currency to send it over the internet.  This is convenient, and works just fine for most people.  There's no need to get into the shady policies of Paypal because it won't affect most people, and most people just don't care.
In order for Bitcoin to replace Paypal, Bitcoin needs to replace other, more popular currencies including USD.  That's what it boils down to.  To that, I say, "Good luck."

Cool idea, but waiters/waitresses already get annoyed enough when I give them $2 bills (which is *real, physical cash*).  I feel like they would go for my head if I gave them one of these.

Yeah, the day when PayPal isn't just fine for 90+ percent of people exchanging money online.  Get real.

$77 setup fee *and* a $2 monthly fee on top of withdrawal fees? That's madness.

I'm checking out Bitstamp, but the minimum withdrawal fee is $15!? That's crazy.

I hope they're using that term lightly.  It's in a hotel and you board in the hotel.  It isn't accredited by anyone. If you graduate with a degree, no company is going to recognize that degree.  It is for-profit.  The founder of the school is mostly interested in taking your money (Bitcoins).

Hit send.  I dare you.

Did that person write, edit, and then like their own comment in only a matter of a few seconds?

It's not like they dropped out because they were doing poorly.  They dropped out because they started making a shit-ton of money on the idea they were able to profit from while in college.  What's the point in staying if you can make more money devoting your time to your profitable idea?
