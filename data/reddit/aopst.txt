Correct. Though it wouldn't be advisable to keep using that wallet - you generated the keys, so you could still do everything with whatever funds end up in it.

The one way that comes to give away bitcoins is:  
1. generate a wallet  
2. send funds to it  
3. save private key as qr code  
4. give away the qr code.  
Anyone who has the private key has full access to the account.

I think it's cool whatever the amount, you're just sharing the love while working as mobile btc faucet and if you're tipping outside this sub, you're exposing people to the new currency.  
No amount is too small, keep it up.

No, there isn't. Paypal has very bad sellers protection and you can always chargeback, even when the payment is sent as a gift and additional notes about the product being already delivered are provided.  
I don't know about any service that would work as a middleman and provide safety for both sides.

Since we all like to make stuff up - I'd be really surprised if 4000cny breaks for good, so far they are holding way stronger than other exchanges. imo. we're bouncing back to 5000+ on monday.

I've been checking the site for some time during this, at one point the house was down to -3000, then it was +3000, many swings between and we're back down to -5000. Quite a ride.  
His latest spree is quite unbelievably lucky though -  - 12 in a row and only 5 out of 35 consecutive massive &gt;50.5 bets missed.
