Just wanted to share this with everyone. This shows how messed up the credit card system is and also how messed up the legal system is here in Florida. I'm still fighting my charges and more details can be found about my case here:

Thanks a lot man, it means a lot coming from you. I know you're in a very similar situation and best of luck to you as well. I'll PM you my lawyers info soon. Keep in touch.

btw, the OP in the post from yesterday definitely wasn't my mom. He's actually some guy in Quebec that saw a show on TV where they interviewed my mom and he tried to help me out by sharing it here. I got a video of me and I'll try to upload the TV if I'm allowed as well.

its gotta be somewhat of topic for two unrelated people to post the same article on the same sub... just saying

When you register a domain with namecheap they include privacy guard automatically. I'm driving at the moment but I'll send you guys proof later today. Would a video be sufficient?

Fellow Quebecker checking in from Miami. If you guys aren't aware of my story, check it out at 
Your site looks great btw

Bitpay doesn't charge me a fee, but whatever is more convenient for you is ok. I appreciate any help.
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:39:31
Whosguard is now turned off. It was put on automatically with the registration of the domain by namecheap. Here's a video of me mentioning the site. Hope that helps.  Thank you!

I understand your concerns. Check my Facebook, it's been a little more active than my Twitter account. I just never care about sharing my life on the internet until now that I'm forced to. TVA in Québec is probably the biggest network, they did their research before putting my story and site on their network. I have a Bitpay account for donations, I had to get it registered for that, I'm not just putting a random Bitcoin address out there either. I'm fully verified with PayPal as well.

Canadian TV show uploaded talking about my website. Sorry its in French but they show the site on the screen towards the end. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-08-25 23:57:19
Thanks for the help. My lawyer has all the evidence, including the full video.

Hi everyone, I've been going through hell in the recent months with these accusation on me. My family and I have spent all of our resources on legal defense and now we need some help. The website explains the details of my case and how you can help by donating to my legal defense fund.

Roger Ver is donating $20k/month for 8 months

As a fellow Canadian living in Florida, I love the idea, but $40/month for maple syrup might be a bit extreme no matter how crafty it is. That's just my opinion of course, wish you guys the best. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 21:10:10
I recorded it. I'll speak with the producer if its ok to post and I'll upload it if they give me the ok.
@_date: 2014-10-20 02:38:11
Looks like you guys are buying at retail price from what I read on your site, have you tried talking with maple syrup producers directly and offering smaller samples, you would cut cost drastically and make it more appealing to the masses
@_date: 2014-09-15 17:35:02
They're on the internet now cause we publish them on the website. My mom was on a TV show in Montreal talking about the site last week. What more proof do you want? 
@_date: 2014-09-15 17:38:18
That's almost what I had to submit to Bitpay and PayPal for account verification lol
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:39:52

Were you there or is that something you read in a news article? You have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:33:57
check my other comments, I've uploaded proof. Thanks for your understanding.
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:08:54
Also to talk about the thermometer, I have to manually update it so I do it once a day. Thanks for your donation though, I'll update it later tonight
@_date: 2014-10-13 19:39:56
oh thanks, I didn't know it was on here already.
@_date: 2014-09-15 12:19:27


The site was created with the help of my family. I registered the site and the legal fund is registered to me in the state of Florida. I also have verified accounts through Bitpay and PayPal for the donations on the site which required me to send all documents verifying my identify.

Startjoin.com accepts bitcoins I believe

Thank you, I appreciate!

My legal costs are well above $50K at the moment and keeps going up constantly. Also, I have to pay $10/day for pre-trial house detention monitoring until till whole process is over. So the donations is to help with all of these costs that I'm just overwhelmed with. I appreciate and thank everyone who donated already but this battle is far from over and I need all the help possible.
@_date: 2014-09-15 12:26:52
Thanks for sharing. We really need all the help we can get.
@_date: 2014-09-15 12:24:09




Also, the personal pictures of me on the site aren't public either.
@_date: 2014-08-26 02:18:13
Thank you!

The funds are sent directly to the legal fund company created specifically for that. You can look up the company and see that I'm the registered person on it. Check out my facebook support from all my personal friends as well if you'd like facebook.com/supportpascal . At the end of the day, if you want to help and contribute to the legal nightmare that I'm going through I appreciate, if you don't want then you just don't. The outcome of this case will have a huge impact on bitcoin as a whole and will set precedents as to how you can transact bitcoins in the US. That's why even the bitcoin foundation help with some legal matters in my case.

The whosguard is now turned off on the domain and here's a link for a video I just uploaded. 
Hope that helps. You guys can complain to bitpay and paypal all you want but its all 100% legitimate. They have copies of my documents and the legal fund is even registered in the state of Florida. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:35:19
I appreciate your help. I've uploaded video showing its real. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-09-01 14:58:08
I can't comment on the details of the case, sorry. You can Google my name and get a pretty good idea of what I'm being accused of. The media wrote their articles based of the arrest affidavit which isn't necessarily accurate either but it'll give you a pretty good understanding of the accusation I'm facing.
@_date: 2014-08-26 12:57:11
Thank you, much appreciated!

Read the charges on my case. One is exactly that.  
@_date: 2015-03-13 02:06:26
A little update on the case. I went to court this morning and the case was continued until June. The new judge also approved a motion allowing me working longer than normal hours during the day since I'm still under house arrest and have been working quite extensively. Thanks to everyone who has supported my family and I during this though situation. We're hopeful for a resolution soon.
If you haven't already, please visit my legal support site at  for more details.
@_date: 2015-03-13 02:18:04
You're so ignorant. Where did you get your information from? Were you there? Get a copy of the audios and get back to me about when they said that.
@_date: 2015-03-01 00:42:46
Coming from a hot dog... Try getting all the case info before commenting please. Media only share what they want to share, till then have a good day
@_date: 2015-02-28 15:59:38
Thanks for bringing this up again. I can't discuss much about the case but I've been waiting for over a year now on house arrest to get this resolved. It destroyed my life and family at this point. More details can be found on my legal defense site at  my next court date is on March 12, 2015. We'll post an update about what's next then.
