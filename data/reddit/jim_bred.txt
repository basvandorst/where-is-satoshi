GUI Miner
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:23:07
Yeah I have "GUI Miner" and that's where it shows my balance. It's directed to a website where I have an account.
I'd post the website but I'm worried someone will go NSA and try to steal my info and get my coins.

This is the price I can currently sell them for?
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:28:16
I was a bit excited at the time and worried.
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:17:33
Me and the wife are currently looking to buy a home and the money could help our down payment for sure. From what I've briefly read some people think the price will drop others think it will skyrocket.
How do I get them put into a wallet?
@_date: 2014-01-24 16:56:15
Holy shit.
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:34:24
Thanks for the help guys I need to make myself a big cup of coffee sit down and do some research. 
I think I just want to put most of it away in a wallet but maybe sell a bit now for some extra cash. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:20:30
I figured there might be a few in there but I didn't know how many. I guess I'm like everyone else now pissed that I didn't grab a bunch when they were cheap.
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:59:46
But all I can think about is imagine they're worthless!
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:18:56
Nice man congrats.
Like I said checking my history I transferred 9.5BTC in 2011 and I remember getting $50 paypal and I was pumped.
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:10:55
So their value is around 900 a coin but it's expected to go up?
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:11:10
How about if I'm in Canada?
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:51:14
Ok thank you I will be home later this afternoon I'll look into it.
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:59:08
That's what I'm leaning towards but then I have to figure out how to sell.
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:09:18
I don't think I even have a wallet? 
I'm so lost I feel like a nub. When I sold them before it was to a guy on a local forum.
I have these coins now I'm shit scared cause I don't know how to deal with them and I'm afraid of getting ripped off.

They are in a wallet on my tower. It's a version of the bitcoin program from 2013. I cannot remember the catchphrase I set.
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:10:07
Yeah I don't know what the hell to do.
@_date: 2017-06-12 00:40:00
I've signed up with Quadrigacx but I just had a holy sh*t moment. I can't remember my wallet catchphrase to send any bitcoins out.
I guess there would be absolutely no way to get that back would there?
