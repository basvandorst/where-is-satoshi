Uh. You're trying to tell me the bitcoin network is a bigger infrastructure project than our roadways, pipelines or shipping channels?

People can't handle the truth.

The concept of crypto-currencies is very flawed if it requires people to be on the same team for it to work.

And if a single one of his coins moves (5% of the BTC in existance) the whole Bitcoin experiment will lose any credibility on the global stage. Banks already on edge pull out and we go back to just being able to buy drugs with BTC. Bitcoin will either go down in history as when the people took back some of the power, or it'll go down as one of the most successful pyramid schemes in history.
Downvotes don't make what I am saying untrue. For those lacking a full understanding the Satoshi coins consist of 980,000 BTC. That's $6,355,300,000 USD as of this posting. Dump that into the market suddenly and watch the value go down.

Simply not true. A lot of their own coin counters or with large amounts simply bag your coins and send them off to be counted by brinks or the equivalent for them.

Why is it surprising that when you provide content to a company that they expect to claim rights on it?

It's under the Intellectual Property segment of the agreement. Not the parts that deal with user to user sales.
