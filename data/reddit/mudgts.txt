This was a plot twist on Coronation Street the BBC Show

Freezeden. True word. I added it myself to Words with Friends. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:32:39
Sorry to hear that. I don’t know if there is a way of getting it back. Did you open a support ticket?  If you have any other coins, you should move them to a hardware wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:49:50
If it’s a $20, it’s mine.  I’ll DM you my address to mail it.

Back in my day, I could buy a pizza with only 3 BTC

Make sure to record your parents faces when they open the hydro bill.

I often find it hard to focus and work when things are going down on me......  are we talking about the same things?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:38:26
You’re welcome?
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:28:02
That’s a cool gift. Sounds like a keeper.

But some litecoin. Then go snowboarding. Win win 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:46:31
have you considered splitting it?  50/50  if you're investing $100/mo into college fund, maybe make it 70/30   BTC is risky, just because it's on a roll now, doesn't mean that it will be in 3 years.

You only lose money when you sell.  Just hodl on for a few months. But never invest more then you can afford. I have maybe 5% of actual funds tied up in crypto. But it’s now worth 15% or my portfolio.

I'll take bitcoin if you want to buy my old Prius.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:06:43
I’ll give you $600 for it and you’ve doubled your money

Make sure you use a 3M preferred Installer. Shop around carefully. Too many backyard shops pretending to wrap cars now a days. You can find a list at the 3M site.  [3M preferred installers USA ](

I told you all that there would be that one person saying this. I. Told. You. So.

Have your client sell them and pay you cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:49:36
Did you write this?  It seems more like a Medium article. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:42:34
yes, plus keep in mind that if the client pays $250K in bitcoin, when the OP goes to cash that out (if they do), the fee that Coinbase charges is 1.49% (?) which is almost $4000
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:26:08
That’s good. I was buying through binance. But that may jack up the price, not that I’m complaining :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:20:10
In between the highs 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:20:47

You only lose money when you sell. Otherwise just close your eyes and don’t touch it 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:20:20
There are other options like DASH and LTC or if they are poor mofos they can by DOGE and patiently wait to make 1/20th of a cent 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:25:41
I hear ya brother. Yet it’s perfectly legal for the government to take the taxpayers money and buy arms to kill people with.  It’s a hypocritical system. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:57:15
Yes. It was a fun read. Try it.

I’m investing heavily in PimpCoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:10:55
It will only be accepted widely if we make the effort to spread the word. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:58:28
Bitcoin is a better investment then lotto tickets.   But once you buy some, you’ll start asking your local retailers to start taking it. And that’s how adoption starts. My favourite roti place takes coins as payment. It’s not the easier thing to do but the effort is there.

Well look at the plus side, it’ll probably be in her Will for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:57:14
I have something like that in a notebook for my wife. It’s like a digital will.  Worth having. Plus you need someone that can understand what to do, not just where to find it. So she knows that if something happens, she needs to contact X person and give him the book and my laptop.

Good for you man. I hope I have the willpower / wisdom to cash out at $30k. It won’t pay my mortgage off but it will make life a bit easier. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:44
Apparently I missed it. All I know is that my BCH shot up massively since I left work.

Delivered?  With extra anchovies?  Still hot to my northern igloo in the Yukon?

Ouch. Was that your story I read about the guy who gave 20 btc to a buddy ?
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:40:16
Ouch. I had .25 of a coin back in 2013 or so but can’t figure out to recall my username / Email or wallet code. It’s a kick in the pants
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:05:37
It’s more for insurance in case we get robbed.  Now if my offline wallet laptop gets stolen and I don’t have my paper wallet accessible,  how much will my insurance cover?  Will they just take my word for it if I say that I owned a couple of BTC?
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:05:35
I spend it where I can. I’m not an investor, I just like secure transactions.

My wife won’t wear bitcoin bracelets. I can’t see it replacing gold.

When I bought my wife’s wedding ring, it was $1000.  We just had it appraised 15 years later and it’s $3850
