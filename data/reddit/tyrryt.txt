Obviously OP is leaving a lot out of the story - there's no way they just went berzerk on some guy rationally and unemotionally discussing the concept of bitcoins.

The exchange value of a currency has nothing to do with its utility.

They gave the nobel peace prize to a guy conducting two wars.  Call krugman what you want, but citing the fact that he's won the nobel prize is not much of an endorsement of his authority.

Great questions.  It seems like they intend to just keep playing the same game they've been playing for the past 60 years.   The US has the greatest military power by orders of magnitude, the greatest political reach and influence, the greatest global consumer and financial control - nobody can realistically force the US to pay up, for fear of being destroyed economically, politically, or physically.
On the other hand, the same was true of every other global empire in history, and each of them collapsed, for some reason.  Rome was every bit as dominant as the US at its peak; France, Spain, UK, even Portugal at one point had great power as well - what did them in?

That's the trouble with trusting a device that you don't control.
A phone, like any device where you can't see and control every single bit, should never be completely trusted.

To add a hint of irony to the indignant preaching, waiters in the US make far more under an "unequal" system than their counterparts in "equal" systems.

It would be much easier to list the periods without an economic fad/bubble in the past few centuries than those with them.
If you're a typical reddit member, though, admittedly 11 years isn't a lot of time to work with.
