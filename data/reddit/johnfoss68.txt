Yeah I rememeber he was a huge btc shill back in early 2016, making all these big claims, people getting excited, but iirc he didn't end up bringing anything to the table. Lucky for him, btc later mooned anyways.

Just use Monero. XMR.

I continue to be surprised that so many Australians can drink so much beer, and yet still have an in depth technical knowledge and understanding of cryptocurrencies.

I'm guessing you're not originally from Japan, so my question is, are you massively homesick after being in Japan for so long? 
@_date: 2018-12-03 06:58:22
Say that to the 2013 bag holders. 
Things worked out ok for them.
