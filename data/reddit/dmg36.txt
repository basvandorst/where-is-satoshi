@_date: 2014-12-08 18:39:30
What's the difference? 
@_date: 2014-11-01 15:37:38
Does that make sense financially? Isnt it a complete waste of money?
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:10:23
What the fuck, if its on tagesschau.de why other sites dont report on it? I know for example Spiegel.de is not a real news magazine more like the "Bild" nowadays but still. That sucks. I hate the fucking press not doing their job right...
@_date: 2014-10-26 12:00:50
My unpopular opinion is its the fault of the US population to go along with it. Sad thing people here are no different.
@_date: 2014-11-27 17:06:30
What the fuck is this? Someon please explain since OP doent do?
@_date: 2014-05-11 13:21:34

@_date: 2014-12-06 13:37:39
What are the obvious reasons?
@_date: 2014-11-01 16:28:30
May I ask what you want to do with it? I read that they cost from 3 to 7 grand. YOu want to mine with that I guess...does it make sense financially? Very cruious...
@_date: 2014-12-06 23:43:31
But are the flaws really that different? Would you say Mac is safer? Im using Mac with Win 7 VM and I can hardly imagine that it has no flaws. Do you have more specific Info on that matter?
@_date: 2014-12-31 16:10:14
Sounds good! 
@_date: 2014-10-30 14:39:41
Only Question is should I buy???
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:37:41
I still have btc there,  is It active immediately? How can they avoid me going to localbitcoin in another country?  Is it now forbidden to buy btc over lb?  Wtf man.

@_date: 2017-06-10 12:22:11
Bitpay is great, I once overpaid significantly and got my money back, that was like Christmas for me...
