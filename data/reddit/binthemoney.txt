Do you want me to put it in my vault to keep it safe?

As others have said, in the interest of protecting whatever Bitcoin is on that device, do not tell anyone any of the information you have found until you get clear instructions. Only you should see, know and use the information you have found, nobody else. Good luck. And my sincere condolences.

So basically what's happened here is the Ledger that OP bought off eBay had already been used by a previous person (the scammer) who has applied scratch foil onto the recovery phrase to make it appear virgin/unique, then OP has reactivated the seed(s), put coins on them, and they've been stolen. Naughty naughty...

What is generally the communicated reason this time? Y'know how we had Jamie Dimon's comments once, China's ban, etc. What is it this time?

Welcome to this part of the world. Research whatever you're investing in. Don't think this is an easy get rich quick thing. Know the risks. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:56:49
This is brilliant. Take my upvote you bastard :D
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:10:27
No, just no. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:52:44
Everyone's answer is different. If you're really struggling day to day then your "limit" will be lower than someone who trades $10k a day. Only you can really weigh up all the risks, benefits and real-life circumstances to produce your own personal limit.

What else did you end up doing? What price did you end up paying? What method did you end up using? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:44:04
I think you're shit out of luck tbh mate sorry. The transfer has been done. Wasn't there any sort of escrow medium you could have used? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:08:31
I think that's extremely optimistic and appears to follow an only bullish prediction. I personally think you're about $2k too high on both charts. Got to allow for drops and recoveries. Nice one though. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:42:02
All your hodl are belong to me. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:32:06
Sorry kid it doesn't work like that. Aren't we all desperate for $3000? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:14:00
Cool. It would be incredible if it reached these values. It's sort of hard to believe, but sort of not! 
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:17:06
Cool. Do they convert it to fiat currency once deposited? Wonder what their exchange rate is. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:05:49
Hodl! 
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:40:07
This just confirms that what actually happens is nothing like your predictions. Dropped when you said it would 3250-3275 (first orange squiggles) and shot up when you said it would 3225-3275 (second squiggles).

Hello. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:15:23
The risk of losing it is why you shouldn't. It's not just about the money, it's about how you deal with a loss like that mentally. You can't say "I'd be fine" because you don't and can't know until it happens. Instead of doing all of it or even half of it, buy $250 for now, watch the market, get involved, then buy another $250 in a month's time or something. This is a lot safer play. There could easily be some big news and shit hits the fan and you need out, and you will lose a lot less. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:45:57
I've been looking at your predictions for some time now and still don't know how the fuck some lines drawn connecting the highs and lows has anything to do with what will happen in the future. What are you saying is gonna happen here, that tomorrow it's gonna be just above $3275? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:48:13
I don't believe you. You definitely live day to day with USD. What do you do for income?
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:33:53
Can you today or tomorrow please post the same chart with the new data, so I can compare it your prediction? This is not to call you out or make an example of you if it's wrong. This is merely in the interest of being able to read charts and make predictions like you do. Thankyou. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:09:40
The transaction fees and time it will take to move the BTC around will hinder you.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:21:16
Good exposure and getting the word out. Well done. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:04:42
It was $3000 not long ago. Mad gainz.

Yes of course but be warned it is very risky and very hard to time the market. You'll need to watch a lot of screens, charts, live ratios etc constantly in order to try and make educated decisions. With high risk comes high reward but also high loss. Be careful. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:28:47
What you say is like a religious prayer or faithful chant. Bitcoin is life.

Just look at the charts. The price keeps going up. Buy some and come back in a month to check the price, it'll be higher. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:11:21
Since you're new, it would be better to buy £50 or £100 every couple of weeks.

No we've gone full spit roast this time.

Bitcoin is going to merge with Ethereum and become Bithereum. You heard it here first...

If the 21,000,000 coin limit is only written into the algorithm(s), can that later be changed to say 42,000,000? And if so what would happen then?

I thought what McAfee said on was it CNBC the other day was very positive and promoting of cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:58:48
This does nothing for me. All exchanges will have a fiat bank account  somewhere, fiat still runs the world. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:57:36
This is brilliant. This really gives cryptocurrencies the exposure that they need, to people who aren't in the middle of all the big cities. This is how word spreads and more fiat is put into crypto. Excellent. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:45:20

Yes of course.

Let's get all this shit out the way and come October things will be on the up. Correction was needed.

They're not lost if you know how to find them. So write down instructions on how to find them, seal it in a zip lock bag and put it somewhere safe.

He could easily move the bitcoin out the address and then post the pic. I call bullshit until OP delivers proof.

Coinbase is pretty easy to use.
