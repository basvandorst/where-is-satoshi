Like, a printer?

Is that a bad thing by itself?
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:58:07
In the starting days that was probably the most important factor. Most people on that sub don't want to acknowledge that though. Take your downvotes like a man if it happens again.

Only if you import keys from another wallet

I'm in Europe, I was supposed to get one in a local store but they sold the one thye had although they told me they reserve it for me .. I didn't find a faster alternative, I don't think Amazon is selling them here.  
  
Edit: could get it from Amazon for 129, I only paid 80€...
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:12:57
I'll take the bet. I think you will win it though.
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:12:50
Don't worry I can afford it ;)

I think after paper and hardware wallets it's one of the best options for long time storage! I never stored everything in 1 wallet though 
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:48:33
Yes, just got confirmed after 31 hours! Thanks for your reply :)
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:21:02
Ok, respect for that! Someone gave them to me a long time ago and I just wanted to give some away now also.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:25:32
Yeah I hope it confirms in the next few days ... Stupid breadwallet only lets you choose to pay ~120 sat/b or ~10 sat/b but nothing in between ..
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:47:24
Would there be a disadvantage if they are stored in the Blockchain wallet when SegWit2X happens?
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:02:30
Thank you! That's a great page.   
  
I think it will be more than a couple of hours, it was 17 hours ago now. Strange thing is that a second transaction with the same fee got through in 65 minutes ...
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:58:29
I will send you some

If you ever need to recover a BIP39 wallet with Electrum or some other wallet, just google which path the wallet you try to recover uses. Most of the times you will find an answer very easily.  
  
I'm really an expert in things like this either, but I recommend looking into your wallets settings and maybe you find which derivation path it uses. Maybe there are some wallets out there which use random ones, could be hard to recover them. But as I said I'm not an expert and don't know if that's true. I just noted the path from all the wallets I use, just to be safe.
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:26:50
Yeah, get a secure paperwallet until you get a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:43:47
Thanks!   
  
Also, Is there something like a queue for transactions, and older transaction with the same fee get confirmed early? Or is it random? Because another transaction with the same fees got confirmed in 65 minutes ... 
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:32:53
But it may arrive after November 18th ..
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:20:36
Most of them charge 5% and also have a bad exchange rate 
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:57:37
Yeah I also heard some bad things about Poloniex. I can relate to your post because I'm also always pissed off especially if I have to withdraw small amounts from BitTrex because of the high fees, so I try to wait until I can pull out a bigger amount.  
  
Seems like there aren't many other options though so it looks like we will both have to continue paying rip-off tx fees
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:24:14
Get a Hardware wallet. If the price goes down again don't worry and DONT PANIC SELL,  but buy more!! I love it when the price drops so I can buy even more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:50:01
If you restore a wallet in Electrum you can choose the option BIP39 and restore a BIP39 wallet. But Electrum doesn't create a BIP39 seed if you create a new wallet with it

Bittrex offers a good service to exchange cryptos, and they make money off those transaction fees.  
  
I'm with you that a 6$ fee is way too much and you could almost call that a fraud. I think they should get those fees from trades and not from withdraws. I can fully understand your frustration!  
  
On the other hand there are so many services which rip you off a lot more. For example the BTC ATMs in my area all charge a 5% fee, and usually the exchange rate on them is also about 5% above the real rate.  
  
Just look out for another exchange which offers the same quality of service but with lower overall fees. If you can't find one maybe Bittrex isn't as bad as you thought!  
  
And if you can find one, please tell me!
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:09:13
Thanks for the reply!   
  
Yeah most likely I will wait for an upgraded TREZOR anyway because it's planned to be announced soon. 
  
My dream wallet would be a more expensive Ledger S with a great and sturdy build.  
  
Did you maybe get your hands on a Ledger Blue before? I don't need all the extra stuff so if it's not built much better quality wise than the Nano S it would be too expensive for me for not much of an upgrade ..
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:47:23
Yes it works, you just have to know the derivation path the other wallet used to recover your funds.  
  
Also it doesn't work with segwit addresses yet I think.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:14:54
Sorry man but I don't understand why you would ever keep 9000$ in a wallet and don't even write down the recovery words or private keys ... 12-24 words written on a post-it to secure your money but so many people don't do it ...  
  
 The money is gone, I'm sorry for you
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:42:30
Why is it more secure due the hardware buttons? Doesn't the Trezor also have 2 buttons for the same purposes?
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:06:52
Best software wallet IMO is Electrum. But I would recommend creating a BIP39 seed with the offline version of this tool:  with an additional passphrase  
  
After that you can create a new wallet in Electrum from your existing seed, you just have to enable the BIP39 seed Import option with additional words

Sorry I can't post it because I can't disclose my wallet identifier for privacy reasons.  
But I have an idea: I made another transaction with the automatic mining fee (164) from the same address, about 2 hours before that so 10 hours ago. Does that transaction need to be confirmed first?  
Because I made a 3rd transaction from a different address with a much lower fee and it is already confirmed ...
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:08:47
Yes, yes it is ... didn't think about that .. that's some hundred dollar I lost if I had known that. Fuck this day everything goes fucking wrong today. BTC is now officially dead for the things I use it for, if the problem doesn't get solved, and 10% transaction fee is not a solution.     
Thanks for the answer though ....
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:15:33
I think it's pretty bad TBH. Today I have a 380 s/b transaction that is at 0 confirmations after 8 hours and I got a 197 s/b transaction which got confirmed after 1 hour. For me it's just absolutely random when a transaction gets through
