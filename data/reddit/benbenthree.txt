Yes, I want to figure out what happened.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:34:01
That's my life saving. I just wish that the thief could have left half for me instead of stealing all.
Really suicidal now...
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:20:25
I think you got the right answer.
My history record is this, despite my url record is correct.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:38:35
no, because it was the time when I could not login 2FA that my account was hacked. (At that time I did not know my account was hacked so I just thought of removing 2FA with support ticket. I have to provide proof such as taking selfie, saying my account details  and submit to the staff for approval. The process took more than half a day.
So I wonder why the staff would choose to remove my 2FA without noticing any abnormalities in my account after one day.

OK. losing btc is all my fault. It is because I am stupid.
So trust those exchanges and do not regret when you suddenly got all your coins stolen one day.

I have google 2FA on bittrex but not my gmail. Of coz I did take your point that not leave BTC on exchanges.
But I was investing altcoins at that moment

no 2FA enabled on my gmail
Yes, it is different
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:16:09
sigh...I was told that google 2FA was safe, but in fact it wasn't at all.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:29:53
I am sure I didn't get to the wrong Bittrex Website because 
1)I have take the screenshot when I could not login and I check it now it wasn't
2)In fact, when I could not login my account, I have tried to login my friend's account at the same page and it was successful. That's why at that time I think it was only sychronize problems that make my 2FA code not work.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:46:28
This seems the most possible explanation but in fact it is not the case.
I have screencaptured the photos and checked with my friends after the incident.
And definitely I did not go to any phishing website. That's why I feel so puzzled and shocked.

Bittrex is one of the world largest bitcoin exchanges, and it still has such poor security system.
You can say I did something stupid that I didn't figure out. But at least in e-banks or online service at local small securities exchange, I won't suffer such a loss just because I haven't protected my account well enough. Because any exchange companies would have security system to protect for the customers well even the customers do not know anything about internet securities.
Really don't understand why so many people can still defend the bitcoin exchanges for their poor securities. 
I really could not understand why I reported to the staff at once when I could not login by using my 2FA, the staff did not notice the abnormalities that my altcoins were being sold at a very low price and was turned to bitcoin and was suddenly withdrawn within 5 minutes.

@_date: 2017-09-28 20:28:00
so u ar correct 
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:41:01
This is exactly what exchange platforms say. Do not want to compensate for the loss of users and always emphasize that the users have their own responsibilities, or saying that the users fake the stolen case. But the exchange platforms never notice their loopholes in their systems.

do u think "treXXX" wallet is a good choice?
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:47:57
how to check for keyloggers
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:15:19
I was on wifi at home.
But probably the thief is not near my home.
I was living in a city that bitcoin still remains unpopular
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:32:49
you can take your own risk. None of my friends have this experience at Bittrex before so I have always been thinking that bitcoin is safe at Bittrex with google 2FA enabled. It was terrifying that in fact the hacker could disable your 2FA and change every setting. (I stilll did not understand how he got the 2FA code to make the change, but it seemed that my 2FA code was stolen at the time when I login at the real Bittrex website. That's y I suspect that the thief could be their staff
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:49:17
it is not likely because at that time I have tried to login my friend's account and it was successful. Then I tried mine, it was not successful. I did it repeatedly and mistakenly concluded that it was just my 2FA has synchronize problems
