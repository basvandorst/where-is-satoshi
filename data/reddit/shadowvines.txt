I hate that you got down voted I think that's an issue with this sub sometimes. Right now at this point in history with current conditions bitcoin is fine. The problem is if it stays the way it is now it's going to eventually lose. Scalability issues bring the need for a fees market (transactions fees) due to the proof of work model that is used to create the trust-less nature of bitcoin. Thats great and all but the general public does not give 2 fucking shits about that (at this point and time in history). If bitcoin doesn't find a way to cope with block size (yes I know about segwit and lightning network) and somehow do away with fees altogether then a proof of stake system will eventually overtake it as a global currency. Think about it, Right now the vast majority of users trade and leave their bitcoin in exchanges, They trust the banks to hold there currency and digital currency thus destroying the trust-less advantages that bitcoin provides. Retailers at the moment use banks to take in bitcoin transactions that get immediately converted into fiat currency. so most of those place you see that accept bitcoin aren't actually collecting bitcoin but running bitcoin through a processor that gives them fiat. That means a proof of stake system with no transaction fees is going to win in the end. I don't know what digital currency that's going to be but there will be one. (tin foil hat mode on)The only possibility that may prevent this is that large corporations that sign such a contract can be leaned on by governments but honestly I think the corporations are already taking over the world anyway.

The new internet requires an open source decentralized storage system. One exists its called Sia. It is almost the exact concept from silicon valley.
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:15:35
So is there anything in or like the lightning network being propose that allow a single company to take payments from a large number of sources and then post those transactions all at once in a trust less way. like same Im a power company rather than making 1000's of single transactions could I potential gather all the transactions from a single pay period and then post those to the chain at once? would there be any advantage to that or would the block size seriously limit large transactions like that?
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:01:52
Ok so to be clear when the "loop" closes or all transactions are complete a single transaction is posted to the blockchain rather than multiple individual transactions for each individual on the lightning network. So it works kind of like a batch process at the end of a day like for credit cards where you take transactions all day and then close the batch.
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:52:12
Lightning network is purely a system of payment used to lower the number of transactions posted to the block-chain to reduce transactions fees and shrink growth of the block chain. What your describing is what Eth essentially does just really poorly and in a non decentralized way. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:16:35
no Storj is controlled by a single private entity just like eth also storj imploded recently the main developer quit citing disagreement with management and might be working for Sia. File Coin it seems will also be controlled by a single private entity so there is that. The developers of Sia have specifically done everything they can to maintain the open source and decentralized nature of Sia they themselves limit how much coin they can even have.

that's actually the new LM003 they cut out early the suspension returns to full height once he gets out.

Ya and I got be honest the concept is fucking genius. but to implement it they will need an easily usable sdk for game developers to integrate the crypto currency into there micro transaction games. I know as a developer if I can just plug in a library and I suddenly have a source of revenue I would be all about that shit.

wouldn't this be the case with any bank however. In the united states at least if someone gets your debit card the bank is not liable to refund that money.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:40:26
not true they clearly state that digital currency is insured
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:17:32
can you explain the second paragraph. I would be very willing to help create a software solution that might be able to help with this. I am sure others would be to.

You shouldn't post pictures with all your private keys in them.

CoinBase is a bank and is infact fdic insured

They can advertise it like government cheese. Hire large development contractor to make tools for it and spread its use. Make it the only acceptable currency to use to pay utilities, taxes,
 government whatever(and allow you to pay those with it). Make trading fiat or authorized crypto currency for unauthorized crypto currencies illegal(which is actually already true in the US. It is illegal to use or create a currency that competes with the US dollar just hasn't been enforced in 150 years). Run campaigns to delegitimize others through attacks or propaganda. Make it illegal to accept  "un-certified" crypto currency as a form of payment as a vendor(this would be done in the guise of tax fraud laws). In truth a government with a standing army can do whatever the fuck it wants whether its a decentralized  currency or not it ability to interact with the real world can always be threatened.

... The only thing this has to do with bitcoin is he was saying in once or twice to investors. The scam itself had nothing to do with bitcoin he even used traditional banks to store the cash.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:02:00
Ok for starters no your bank does not give a shit about you and your money. They will care if a number of things happen. 
- Your do enough of these transaction over a certain period to trigger there FinCen reporting standards. Most people think a CTR report has to be filed only when a transaction exceed $9,999 This is a mandatory CTR number but... its up to the institution to set these standards it actually written so that the financial institution sets what triggers a CTR and they can report for literally anything they feel like so what triggers that could be different from institution to institution. They do have to submit this plan to auditors for review.
- You are on a list. institutions receive lists from FinCen comprised of every government agencies watch lists. If your on it your fucked.
other than that financial institution don't give a shit about you and your bitcoin.

Ah well thats amazing

I think i've watched most of the videos already.
- The fed was passed by 3 congressmen while everyone was at home over christmas.
- Woodrow Wilson Signed the bill and afterward said it was the single worst thing he'd ever done
- The fed has private investors to which no one actually know for sure who they are
- The fed is headed by banks and 2 appointies from the president
- The Fed print funny money gives it to banks which loan out in a 1/10 ratio which for anyone else would be super illegal
That about the gist of it?

Thank you for this statement. I get annoyed by nonconstructive comments like the one you replied to.
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:03:50
Amazing answer thank you so much. I think for now I will put a little money in and see how it goes. I am currently using coinbase is there a better exchange out there?
