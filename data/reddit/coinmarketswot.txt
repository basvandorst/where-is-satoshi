Buy what you're willing to risk. Then don't whine about a rough ride. The status quo won't let Bitcoin grow easily. They can't stop Bitcoin, but they won't give up silently. 
Eventually it will rise beyond the 1000 USD per Bitcoin. I expect this to happen in 2015.
You should concentrate on the growing adaptation and technical developments.

Small memes, big memes. Understand the mass, the bigger the hype in a big mass the more stupid they react. The meme controls individual thinkers.
The next mainstream news is that IS has some bitcoins. They don't show any transaction on the blockchain to back their propaganda. Meanwhile IS deals with millions in Fiat Currency. 
Got the point? The blockchain technology is strong and the 10.000 best coders in the world are not journalists. The coders are defenseless nerds just concentrating on their great job. The idiots out of the mainstream media are just trolling and bashing.
Small memes, big memes. The public don't know the coders, they only understand the mass media. Most of them believe everything the so called journalists write are tell on youtube.

One big issue missed, and by missing this disqualified the honesty of Mister Gates.
As a programmer he should mentioned the power to program value with Bitcoin.
No matter how poor you are, you now can create value by attracting attention to your work.
You can create a free bitcoin bank, hold your private key secret and offline and make good money with the most powerful tool on Earth: Creativity
Lets create a new browser to make this happen for the underbanked people. 
Any mobile phone can now capture/create anything of value and share for Bitcoins.

**lesson to be learned**
The mainstream already brainwashed the mass, the score board tells us: ~Mainstream 1025 : Bitcoin 2~
No matter what great world leader/ captain of industries or celebrity tells via mainstream media. &gt;Bitcoin has become immune to it. 
It's a matter of time that all the puzzles fall into places. Suddenly the mass recognizes the need for Bitcoin at countless levels. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 08:33:32
he won't stop, because bitcoin will hit 100,000.00 the very next few months after it hits 10k. 
Look at the price movement of April'11 till May'11, it went 1000 % up in one month. That was before the 32 USD drop to 2 USD, all the Media was in ecstasy to declare Bitcoin's dead. So dead that Bitcoin grew another 50,000.00%

Next week Greece election will cause the EURO to loose value. The Swiss know all about this, they already aborted the EURO mess. 
Election in The Netherlands next March will result the anti EURO group to be the biggest. Awkward detail is that Jeroen Dijsselbloem (financial president of EUROGROUP, Dutch guy) has an exit plan for The Netherlands. 
USA has printed trillion of USD last couple of months, September 2015 the printed Trillions are vaporized again. So USA has to come up with another heart attack solution for the continent. The world won't take this any longer.

Bitcoin is a neutral area, they'll learn to recognize this. 
They'll see that the sinkholes are in their own system, in heir on countries. 
Bitcoin is a world wide neutral network to balance out. 
Saillant detail: Each European country already has an exit plan for the Euro. Even The Netherlands, and the current president of the Eurogroup, and president of the Board of Governors of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is a Dutch guy (Jeroen Dijsselbloem).

Then, you'll make foldable paper that has the function as your touchscreen. Each paper has a unique private key hardcoded, hashed with a multisig. This multisig has the function to turn on or off the value of your hard coded paper: The hard coded paper can only hold 10,000.00 Bits Yes/ No. 
If you pay with your paper, it's signed to 10,000.00 value NO. 
If you receive 10,000.00 on your paper, it's valued Yess

Best thing is NOT to explain how his system got "hacked", best thing is to know it and improve the system. But the best thing wouldn't be the best if he doesn't make sure every client got refunded.
Why should you explain a weak point if your colleagues might face the same attacks? The community should work together to get this in to the mainstream. To get this work for both govs, banks and common people. They are not all evil, they just need better tools to manage the needs of the most of us.

another focus on the price, so silly.
And it's absolutely not true that early adopters are rich, more true is that they dare to take more risks. But that's about the price again.
Still, if you truly want to force Bitcoin in the price corner. It will never for 100% replace any currency. That thought in the info graphic is just fantasy. Bitcoin can perfectly reside along with current Fiat Currencies. With this in mind people can always enter the ecosystem and leave, even after the year 2140.
In fact it's even good that some dictators and conservative countries forbid Bitcoin, regimes do change in time. This brings air movements beneath the wings of Bitcoin. 
Most important and true is what you can do with the technology. It's so open and fun to do anything with the open ledger. listen for example to the open new world with &gt; or the exiting service of &gt;

one day private keys will be paired or grouped, so more than one private key is needed for the current function of One Private Key.
At that fast forwarded time somewhere near the year 2100 computing power might be able to trigger collisions and touch the surface of security. Massive combined computing power might be able compromising 1 private key out of the trillions existing keys. 
Before that moment the community already has paired and grouped private keys in a hard fork update. 
To answer you: from this day it's real magical time for gold diggers. Hunting the private keys with access to those thousands or millions lost private keys.
At this moment of computing power, it's simply impossible.

Recognize one thing, then see for yourself:
Has Bitcoin set foot in your country? So does it in all countries.
What is the growing rate of the biggest bank of your country? Bitcoin beats all banks in all countries.
Have you heard about, Changetip, Bitshares, Coinbase, Bitaddress, Blockchain.info, Shapeshift, etc?
They all grows faster than any banker can talk 
Have you heard about the currency war, corrupted systems? Or lets keep it simple: Ruble, Swiss Franc, Euro, Grexit, QE of both USA and Europe?
**Bitcoin is the only corridor to the future**
 * So, if you ask me about Bitcoin in five year: &gt;   $     10,000.00 USD
 * And, if you ask me about Bitcoin in 10 years: &gt; $ 1,000,000.00 USD
If you think I talk in mirages, I've been in the banking industry. 1 million USD is just change for the bankers. Each nation can print trillions of USD, behind the wall, nobody really knows.

**a**= There is totally no risk in adapting a new technology as Bitcoin. It open doors for young engineers to kick more doors open for the whole country and beyond.
also **a** can perfectly exist alongside all Fiat Currencies in the world. The step to accept and adopt Bitcoin isn't finite, it's not absolute and it's not a jump into outer-space. It's a new technology layer for your society, a big advancement of the old paradigm.

once upon a time banks boycotted Bitcoin. Banks do anything to control or even enslave people, while they live with extreme privileges. Everything you "own" if under supervision of the bank. They can switch off your account, like Russia, Snowden and many other low profile people.

there's no threat. All that you've mentioned: Bitcoin has been there, survived that. 
That explains the low price. If the price remains low, Bitcoin stays below the radar and strengthen it's scalability. Early adaptors have better change to buy cheap Bitcoins. 
The institutional buyers can jump in any time, any day. By that day the price of 1 Bitcoin is not reachable for 90% of the people.

**here, some educational stuff about the price for you**
@_date: 2015-02-02 09:27:21
this is a fair question. The question is: *why is the sun **not** important?*


The sun does not discriminate nations or religions. The sun is here and now, just like Bitcoins. If you grow now, you might grow stronger in time like Sequoia trees. 
The sun holds massive power to tap in. We're only using a ridiculous minor part of its power. Like Bitcoin. 
Analogy with the sun is, that we should try to understand this power more wisely. Get out of the shadow, absorb and understand the energy it holds within. Don't cage yourself. 
The price is like the sun. At this moment the price is perfect, because it learns a lot of people not to get sunburned.
Meanwhile lots of engineers are working on great shields to protect the community, while enabling more features to tap into mighty powers of the sun/Bitcoin. 
In the long run it makes the sunburn of 1200 USD like a good childhood lesson while playing unprotected in the desert sun of the wild wild west/east.

I think you're doing an excellent job, good to have several withdrawal options. 
My advice would be: Be an exchange and nothing else but an exchange. 
Your advertisement on games are distracting. Stick to your core business and focus to be the best in the field. 
**BitYes.com is the best exchange: make your deal and go cold storage!**
 
Stick to 2 golden rules:
1 protect your client at any cost! Encourage them to go cold storage.
2 get the deal for your client smoothly as possible and go to rule 1.
Educate your clients on how to execute safe cold storage. 
Also provide them knowledge on how to best secure a small amount of hot storage to reduce the risk.
I think you're doing fine on security. 
Good luck, all the best. 
Educate them about cold storage and encourage your clients to withdraw asap.

Players come and go. So do providers. 
The modern providers wiill gain territory if they provide a bitcoin switch mechanism, add this mechanism to their current policy. 
So clients may enter via Bitcoin, and may leave via Bitcoin, but provider won't the risk of storing Bitcoin. .Clients pay for the switch, which is much cheaper than any other method. This will boost any poker and gaming business

Congratulations Bruce. Great to sense the energy of this move of yours. Haters are a bit worried about what you guys are cooking. 
Hopefully you guys recognize the need for the good spices. Marketing and spreading positive message is good for the community. We need more artists, they are always there when things have to change a bit. 
Blockchain technology can save millions of kids and families. 
Gosh, wish you guys invited me to speed up this process on a genius and right way. We need some people without any degrees too, people who survived anything and are against all odds on top of things. 
Tap into the existing networks of humanity and empower the people with this technology. In your position it's extremely easy to organize. I got this up and running within six months and having Bitcoin dominating the world press for the better. 
Don't be naive about the mainstream media, they can reach the critical frequency for mass hypnosis and trap even highly intelligent people. It's embedded in human nature and our comfort zone. You've got to play a smarter game. Not disrupting, but teasing with disclosure the very good of the technology, comprehensive and gentle, yet sexy and attractive for all, even the status quo. 
Once Bitcoin is rooted in all societies with a proof of work, pulsating new great achievements around the clock. Not destroying existing systems, but offering all a chance to improve ourselves.

This is exactly the genius design of Bitcoin, it fits and it works at a near 0 fee. No matter you send 1 million USD or 0.10 Euro.
But trolls prefer to pay with Master Charge, with a revenue of a few billions USD annually, paid by uneducated people.
