I tried verifying my account on dec 12 with bitstamp. I am still waiting for verification. I’ve given up on getting verified

Actually, I’m not sure if Morgan Stanley does HFT. Come to think about it, I’m pretty sure it’s Goldman Sachs that’s one of the leaders

Because of high frequency trading algorithms?

Holy shit, that’s crazy.
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:42:01
Morgan Stanley has an entire sector dedicated to HFT. They aren’t too vague.

Anyone read Flash Boys? It’s been on my reading list for a while. It’s amazing how they built a fiber line directly to Wall Street to shave off the smallest time fragments just so they can buy and sell in an instant. That’s more or less what I was joking about.

Isn’t this one of the points of bitcoin? Stable currency? Not having to rely on a country or central bank to dictate currency?

One of the best financial decisions you can make for your kids education. It’s no bitcoin but I started one over 8 years ago and have seen it absolutely excel.

For a newbie, this information is pretty important.

But that’s not illegal or against our rights even if it was true. These private companies can censor whoever they want for what ever reason they want, conservative, liberal, Idiot Trump Supporters, it doesn’t matter. They have that right and are protected to censor conservative voices at Will. I’m not sure why I capitalized Will. Anyone read Saga? The mother fucking Will. The Will. Hot damn Saga is amazing. Anyways...
What I’m having such a hard time understanding is that it’s pretty likely that Twitter is censoring conservative voices simply because they are breaking their ToC and saying some shitty things that are putting people in danger so, why the fuck would conservatives continue using their services if they are being censored? No one is forcing conservative voices to use Twitter.  Don’t like it? Fuck right off and use a different service. Twitter isn’t violating your constitutional rights so go find someone more sympathetic to your viewpoints. Fuck.

Ah yes, but payment isn’t a form of free speech, at least I don’t think it is. Wait, isn’t citizens united about free speech? The law is difficult but I’m sure there’s a pretty good reason for all of this.

Exactly. The president is now using twitter as an official means to communicate to the public. His tweets would (and should be) available to everyone because he is a government entity. The rest of Twitter is not obligated to the same kind of first amendment restrictions (or lack there of) because regular people like you and me are not government employees or use Twitter as our official government method to communicate to the public. There’s already been case law regarding this, I’m lazy to link but you should read it, it’s pretty interesting. 
Long story short, just because Trump doesn’t have the same free speech rights on twitter doesn’t mean the rest of us don’t. He’s a government employee using twitter as his official channel to communicate to the public. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 02:06:01
No, that’s not how it works. Since he is a government employee and he has chosen to use twitter as his official communication method to the public, he is not allowed to restrict citizens from reading his communications, moreover, he’s not allowed to censor anyone.  Blocking someone on Twitter has been ruled by the courts as a form of government censorship. That doesn’t mean you or me or any other person not employed by the government (or they could be employed by the government, their account can only be for personal and not governmental use) can block or censor anyone we they want whenever they want because, yay free speech! 
And Trump certainly doesn’t “have” to read anything that is written about him. He certainly doesn’t read his intelligence briefs, hell, I doubt very much that the guy even reads anything these days as he’s well known to get all his information from Fox News or some little birdie in his ear that is stroking his ego. What an asshole. 
And in terms of threats, multiple people have been investigated by the secret service for threatening the president, even if it was a very thinly veiled threat.

Twitter is a business. A business is allowed to censor anything they want on their private servers especially with a TOS outlining such.  
The first amendment allows Americans to speak freely and not be censored by the government. 
He’s running a business, he’s not running a currency that is supposed to be decentralized. Twitter is not decentralized. Twitter is a for profit business that does what it likes with your speech. Don’t like it, don’t fucking use it.

It’s seems to me that the road to stability is in increased valuation and adoption. As we can clearly see that over bitcoin’s inception, the price has continued to go up (ignoring the obvious bubble). Stability isn’t possible until it’s adopted and can be used practically. We have a long way until that happens but there is an undeniable movement for cyrpto (Bitcoin having majority market share) so, maybe all this pump and dump are minor set backs until it become a stable world currency. The fact is there is interest to pump and dump, I’d say that contributes to its valuation and when adoption picks up we’ll get closer to stability. 
But it’s not stable now. Nothing about bitcoin is stable right now other than the fact it is susceptible to major price swings. I’m a believer but I’m not buy that it’s “stable”

His reputation is in danger? I think that boat sailed a long long time ago. Don’t get me wrong, he’s entertaining AF but that guy is bananas.

And wouldn’t that holder of crypto need to adhere to some kind of regulation/laws about loaning money with interest? 
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:02:09
So who would I go to if I needed a loan? If not a bank, a holder of a large share of crypto?
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:01:00
I have, but I’m not very familiar with it. It’s also not very common for large scale loans for real estate or business loans. What kind of laws/regulation are involved with lending? It must vary from state to state, country to country. So, would whales become the lenders of capital? Banks have an ungodly amount of capital at their disposal so unless they transition that money or other large institutions begin transferring their wealth I can’t see how lending will work. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:06:20
Banks also have assets and a reputation that I imagine gives confidence for lending. Banks are adhering (I hope) to local and state laws, taxes and regulation. Will the whales of crypto become lenders of capital? How will lenders in the cryptosphere adhere to tax and government regulation? I’m not doubting cryptos potential however I think there are some major hurdles that banks may have an upper hand in initially especially if they can survive the transition to the crypto/blockchain sphere. If I was a bank I’d probably try and develop my own blockchain tech and build upon my reputation for continued trust in capital and lending.

One of the cyber security conferences I worked for had a lecture about how any company, banks included, that deal with personal information should have a large bitcoin and/or crypto currency wallet that can be used in the case of a ransom/cyber attack. In this day and age it is very possible that a major company can and will get hacked, even if they have a strong cyber defense team/protections and paying a small ransom is preferable to the release of compromised information. Just food for thought. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:09:17
Perhaps. I think it matters upon the contract, size of loan, what the loan is used for and who is allowed to sign the contract. Financial and business lawyers make a lot of money for a reason, it’s incredibly complicated and difficult to navigate. At least that’s how I understand it. So, anyone lending big money in crypto would probably need the same kind of help and navigation to successfully implement. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:15:07
I think you are vastly underestimating the power, confidence and trust banks have in the financial sector.  
For you, you don’t see a way to embed banks into crypto but that certainly doesn’t mean it won’t happen. I dislike banks as much as the next guy but I’m not going to hold unrealistic expectations or fool myself into believing that banks will be disappearing anytime soon or will be complacent as the world slowly adopts crypto. We are a long ways out from crypto becoming the norm and the “trust” enormous financial institutions and corporations have with banks isn’t going anywhere any time soon. These banks will adjust and figure out a place with or without your confidence. 
It’s worth having that discuss instead of disregarding the possibility it will happen. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:13:34
Banks do much more than just store money in accounts. I always thought the biggest part of their business was loans. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:01:06
Because I don’t have the money. I need to go to someone with capital (and lots of it) to take a risk on someone like myself. I’m not saying crypto won’t take off, I’m just thinking banks will still have a role to play
