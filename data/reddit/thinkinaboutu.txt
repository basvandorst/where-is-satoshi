Yes an important distinction indeed. Felt I didn't need to include it out of context, especially since I'm preaching to the choir.

I don't think you've read my post/comment... The whole problem is that I can't log in because I don't have access to my wallet because of SMS 2FA. I can enter my log in details, but I can't access my wallet because 2FA isn't working. This is the whole issue. If I could just log in, then we wouldn't be having this discussion in the first place
I could potentially skip steps one and two if I had access to my recovery phrase, but like I said, that is in my safety deposit box, and I am currently traveling.

By private keys, I meant the recovery phrase. I don't keep the private key written down, not really any reason for that considering I have the recovery phrase. I just have the recovery key written down in my safety deposit case in case anything does happen. Just bad timing :p

"Huh, I didn't know that, though it totally makes sense now that I think about it :p. That would be useful if it wasn't locked in a safety deposit box back home (currently on a week long trip abroad). Good to know for the future!"
Looks like I was wrong in my above statement... In reference to "blockchain", I am talking about blockchain.info/wallet, not the ledger as it relates to Bitcoin

* Technically I have 3FA (password, SMS, Email) so I don't see how the added security would be a detriment vs just email.

How would you even go about determining which coins were lost vs being stored for long term investment? So to answer your question, they are lost forever.
