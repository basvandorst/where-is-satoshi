How come it is not bouncing up enough? Everything that could crash it already has gone through. What’s wrong with the market?

KOREANS ARE THINKING KOREAN TRADING MARKETS ARE MANIPULATING THE WHOLE MARKET. How come it always crashs when it goes up?

stop throwing bitcoins. you guys always throw when Koreans raises price. We're going to hit 12000 today

LOL the reason that bitcoin is dropping is Koreans think Americans throw coins on weekend. (it's been like that actually) WE GOTTA RAISE UP!!

Bithumb usually freezes alone but in this morning, Upbit froze together when Bithumb froze at the same time.

people who are waiting for 8K = Who didn't get to grab it when it went 9k

There's no reason we should sell in low now. it's just correcting by itself

True. A lot of people are trying to move out abroad because government and server crash.. The reason we have Korean premium is because chinese people invest in Korean market after their government bans trading Cryptos.
