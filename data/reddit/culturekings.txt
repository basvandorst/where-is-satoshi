Very high for us actually, friendly fraud is a pain in retail and bitcoin completely removes it. Also because we have to use fraud systems on credit card anyway bitcoin confirmation times can actually be much faster than an order going through manual fraud review which can take 12 hours. So with bitcoin you can know you won't hit a fraud filter and your order being delayed for dispatch.

thanks for the support, also just on your instagram post - we are coming soon

We just need Bitcoin's brand name + Monero's privacy + Ripple's speed and crypto is solved.

Yeah it can work and for us we like to give people the choice and not just make assumptions on our end. We have already put it out to stores to provide info on customer interest, if it is there we will plan something out.
As far as long term I think its only a matter of time before Ripple or another strong currency that is built on a fast confirmation system will gain strong ground on the instant payment front. Once we get to that point physical retail can really start changing.

brilliant idea! and complete oversight on our part. We have now activated it on the site. However sadly it only currently supports rounding to 2 decimal points. We have hit up the team that supports our currency conversion to expand the precision and hopefully it will be implemented in the coming days.

we aren't suppose to be like anyone, we do things very differently. If you have never seen us check out this video from a recent store opening. [Pacific Fair Opening](

I'm guessing you would be really good at haiku's.
I think your leading to the fact you can have multiple addresses. As we are a business we can't leave the money sitting in thousands of bitcoin addresses. So the moment we consolidate these to pull them out we lose our anonymity and everything is connected.  So by someone just getting one of our bitcoin addresses and then waiting until we consolidate, they get a view of everything we have done. 
So as said before Bitpay is for us and own wallet isn't. Not saying it can't be done by why would we bother.

To be honest with the likes of Bitpay and Coinbase the barrier of entry for retailers is almost none. If anything it is actually one of the best currencies to support in terms of fees and fraud handling. Everyone who hasn't moved just doesn't understand how it plays in to the picture yet.

Also forgot to mention I'm actually the COO of Culture Kings so your message is already heard. A lot of our team use bitcoin personally so we know its value, I first invested in 2014 so have personal experience so we have plenty of confidence. It would take something big for us to turn it off, but something that big would also take bitcoin down.

We are always on the look out for good local stuff. Recommendations are always welcome. AU and NZ brands do have some really great stuff when they pop up.

This is why we have launched with online first. confirmation times make it impossible for physical retail stores. Nobody wants to go to a shop, checkout and then stand around for 40 mins.
Online works perfectly as by the time we receive the order, possibly start packing and having it ready for dispatch the confirm is done and we can let it out the door.

not a bad idea. I see that working well in the couple of stores we have in shopping centres/malls but other stores are free standing buildings so it might not work so well as there aren't many other options to kill time.
Like amazon we are working on try before you buy so online is starting to remove that barrier of wanting to try things on first.

this isn't our thread btw but to avoid this going on for days. 
I'm sorry we aren't Bitcoin purists and that we believe BitPay is a valid part of the bitcoin ecosystem. We should have spent months building a custom solution using the direct bitcoin RPC's and manually solving all the issues with ensuring anonymity for our customers when using bitcoin rather than just using BitPay's amazing integration that just takes sign up and account approval.

Without the trolls is reddit really reddit. 
On the actual news we just want to help make Bitcoin what it can be and we know us doing this will likely force the rest of fashion retail to follow. I'd love to see bitcoin start being used as a currency rather than just as an investment portfolio.

It is no secret we are using Bitpay so the easiest way to answer this is just [Bitpay Pricing]( we don't have any other fees etc on top of that
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:44:12
sorry man but that makes little sense. Our customers can purchase with bitcoin and it gets processed by BitPay.
As for running our own wallet, sorry this will never happen. Bitcoin is great but has some little issues such as with a known address everyone would have the ability to see our transaction volume, customer loyalty levels and so much more. Plus it would open up our customers wallets to being analysed which is the last thing we want.
We will stick with Bitpay and the other processors to cloak this for us and keep ours and our customer transaction data secure and untraceable.

doesn't seem to agree with you on that [
