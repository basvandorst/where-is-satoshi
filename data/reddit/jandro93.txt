could you provide a source for this? Doesn't relying on an individual exchange make them kingmakers by providing legitimacy to that exchange?

So basically its just a way to extract money out of ignorant people?

Openstax is a free textbook initiative started by Rice University (a top 20 school) to provide free textbooks. Below is a link to their intro to economic principles textbook. The first half of the book focuses on micro econ and the second half focuses on macro econ. Chapter 29 is an introduction to money and banking.  Its the textbook i used 2 years ago and its actually a pretty good read. 
You can download the pdf or view the book online.

The case for bitcoin being a store of value like gold is a lot stronger than bitcoin every becoming a currency. Most of the people in this subreddit fail to understand how awful it would be to lose control of the money supply. Messing with the money supply is one of the primary ways we deal with recessions.

This sub has become a load of garbage. My post gets flagged for removal because it pertains to price/trading but i guess all the price memes are ok...

I figured it out. CBOE will base the price off of Gemini and and the CME will use the Bitcoin Reference Rate which is an aggregate of prices on four different exchanges.

Very well stated and i couldnt agree more. Wish there was more substantive discussion on the crypto subreddits instead of just “to the moon!” and “hodl” memes.

I really only trade the upside because i dont trust any the exchanges enough to have a margin account to short.

I feel like everyone says that before the bubble pops. Doesnt mean bitcoin and crypto wont be part of everyone’s future. Its just that at these prices you would think its going to happen next year.

As determined by studying thousands of years of human history and how money has functioned over that time period. These are the consensus requirements taught in every intro to macro economics course.  If you disagree and can prove it wrong there is a nobel prize waiting for you.

Make a coinbase/gdax account and sync your bank account. Make sure to use gdax on a computer as opposed to the coinbase app to avoid fees. Transfer the bitcoin from the wallet your brother gave you to your gdax bitcoin wallet. Use a limit order to sell on the open market. Once sold transfer to your bank account. If you have any questions about specifics feel free to send me a message.

OP may or may not be a an economist but he doesn't properly define the functions of money/currency. 
1. A currency must serve as a medium of exchange, which means that the currency acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. To serve as a medium of exchange, a currency must be very widely accepted as a method of payment in the markets for goods, labor, and financial capital. 
2. A currency must serve as a store of value. However, it does not need to be a PERFECT store of value because normal currencies are expected to be subject to inflation. It must not have wild swings in value. 
3. A currency must be able to serve as a unit of account, which means that it is the ruler by which other values are measured. A currency acts a common denominator, an accounting method that simplifies thinking about trade-offs.
4. A currency must serve as a standard of deferred payment. Which means that if a currency is usable today to make purchases, it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that will be paid in the future. Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and that standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future. 
Edit: to any interested here is a link to an excellent free intro to econ textbook created by rice university. I literally took this list of functions out of chapter 29: Money and Banking.

Please explain to me how control of the money supply is no longer used to combat economic downturns or an overheating economy. Also, central banks have existed for thousands of years and i would wager they will exist for thousands more.

Real economists with a phd dont concern themselves with bitcoin until someone asks them about bitcoin. Bankers are not economists.

No one has even been able to explain to me why the tokens for a lot of the alt coins even need to have a monetary value. Seems like a lot of developers are just using ICOs as a quick way to get rich.

I'm not trying to make a judgment on bitcoin but after a certain post got voted to the top today I had to set the record straight.

Its so basic and widely accepted that you’re basically asking me the money and banking equivalent of showing you studies that say 2 + 2 = 4. So instead i will provide links to sources that say exactly what i said. 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
P.S. i just googled “main functions of money” and looked for the most reputable sources on the first page.  I can also send you a picture of a the functions of money from my old macro econ textbook if you’d like.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:33:24
They also forget that inflation incentives people to use their money.

You could say the same thing about the magic money wizard or a ton of other overused memes. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:09:42
Yep, literally took those 4 criteria out of my intro to macro econ textbook from a couple years ago. 
Edit: Link to the textbook. Its free to view online or download a pdf. Chapter 29 is intro to money and banking.

The federal reserve would issue Fed-coin before they ever let these decentralized monstrosities become a world currency. People on this subreddit do not understand the ramifications of having no control over the money supply. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:20:35
We’re going to have to agree to disagree. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:13:42
Those are the consensus criteria that have been taught for hundreds of years. It really isn't up for debate. Take an intro to money and banking class. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:16:10
Using something that has a fixed quantity as a currency leads to perpetual deflation as the economy grows. It also means that we would have no control over the money supply. Controlling the money supply is one of the primary ways that we combat recessions. The federal reserve would issue fed-coin before they ever let a "fixed" currency come into existence.

There is so much more money to be made on the long side vs the short side. I'm not too concerned. Shorting has limited gains where as the theoretical gains from going long are unlimited.

This is the logic behind stocks doing splits but a lot of research has shown it doesn’t make too much of difference. Just look at Amazon stock as a good example. Plus unlike a stock in the crypto world you can by a fraction of a coin. What really matters if is the person believes what they’re buying has potential to increase in value.

I can't find other corroborating sources for these quotes so I am inclined to believe they are not real.
