OP means the poster above you does it not? Fuck it. I was on mobile and couldn't remember u/kiljoymcmuffin name.

Oh that’s awesome! Thank you. 
-edit- It doesn’t work on iOS 11. Guess I’ll just have to swipe up and lock screen like a heathen.

So does China do this so that they can sell off their coins before implementing the ban then when the price falls because of the ban, the govt buys and then price soars again? Rinse repeat?

This can't be a bot. Haha. What a great account.

Wow, thank you. Did not know that. Does Gemeni offer withdrawing from your bank directly into/out of Gemeni like Coinbase does? I've had coinbase since 2014 or somewhere around there and I have a bigger limit because everything is "verified". Haven't purchased in a couple years but when I was using it, I had no problems getting coins. Thanks again.

But didn't the market for "goods" purchased with bitcoin guarantee the movement of coins?
