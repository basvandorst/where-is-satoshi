So how do I get my job back with bitcoin?

Oh noooo. Here in the Philippines you just need a cheap android phone with a local sim card. coins.ph

Isn’t coinbase 9999x easier than this?

Or maybe the TWEET you just linked has just nothing to do with with bitcoin. Lmao.

Andreas Antonopoulos has a video explaining the difference in btc/usd prices in different countries. 
Just search “andreas antonipoulos price premiums and arbitrage”

Doesn’t matter if btc price goes back to 1 usd. What matters is it works regardless of price. 
Try checking out Bitcoin use in countries with corrupt leaders like Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Argentina.

Uhm... I’m confused kind sir.  The tweet has nothing to do with bitcoin. This was about the facetime vulnerability issue with apple.

My husband gave me bitcoin last week as a birthday present. So that’s good news for me.

Hi new peeps. To answer a few questions I keep getting asked:
- Yes, I'm still alive
- No, I don't really hold BTC anymore (Yes, I'm serious)
- Yes, I hold some alt-coins (mostly ETH, RDD and Sia)
- Yes, I did have BTC but sold it at around $15k to pay student loans/cap gains

I watched someone in an interview(i forgot who) he said that around 4 million bitcoins are lost forever.
