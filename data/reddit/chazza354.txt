This would end up being more expensive than using banks, due to high fees etc. Also how do you expect to pay utilities with Bitcoin? What happens if Bitcoin crashes horribly?

Well Linux may be used widely in this corner of society, but your average person won't have even heard of it. As for the internet, that's what I mean about dressing it up for mainstream consumption. Most internet users click 'the internet button', search for what they need in Google, go on YouTube for their videos, and Facebook to keep up with friends. They have no idea what processes go on behind the scenes. While I don't necessarily support these companies, they've captured a huge audience due to the quality of their product.
Surely there needs to be more Blockchain based apps/websites developed that hide all the jargon and dress up the front end user experience as simple and intuitive. Can't be too hard, right? I like what I've seen with Steemit in this regard, though that's not using Bitcoin.

'As with all technology, something better may one day come along. “When that happens, bitcoin’s value could collapse to near-zero, probably in a matter of hours or minutes, in a spectacular ball of flames. It has no support structure to prop it up, like a normal currency does. Do not treat this as a long-term store of value to fund your retirement.”'
This is the most probable way that Bitcoin will die - if it fails to adapt and innovate it will be replaced by a superior product eventually.

No of course not - I'm a noob when it comes to economics, but I'm aware that excessive inflation devalues currency and is not healthy or sustainable. That wasn't my question though lol

Sorry dude I'm not quite sure what you mean - please explain?

This really highlights how susceptible Bitcoin is to collusion and market manipulation, and how the price is basically propped up on speculation. Without some sort of market regulation, there will always be bad people exploiting the market for personal gain and having significant effects. I'm a Bitcoin holder but I really worry for the future of it.

I guess so. It really needs to become accessible to those who aren't too techy though: to be packaged in a way that is consumer-friendly and non-intimidating. My other worry is that from what I've read, the Bitcoin community is largely driven by a radical end of anarcho-capitalist libertarian views, which alienates a lot of people. It seems way too politicised to catch on in a big way.

You can instantly purchase as little as $1 worth of Bitcoin on Coinbase. Very easy and nice layout for a new buyer.

fantastic, great read - cheers :)

we'll have to wait and see how this service plays out, but tbh I think anything associated with Kim Dotcom has very little chance of catching on in a mainstream way these days.

I mean more in the event that they completely destroy the TOR network or something. I know it probably won't happen, but you never know.

Hmm I think the proportion of total Bitcoin expenditure going toward criminal activity is a lot higher than any of the mainstream currencies, but I take your point for sure: crime is inevitable. 
I personally think it's hugely convenient and beneficial to use money currency over heavy and space-consuming gold regardless of government, but I'm no economist so I won't try to argue that one lol.

Ah ok I didn't know the Linux was the basis for those things. I thought you meant the consumer Linux OS.
