What about making real-world pairs? Like how many pounds of gold do you need to buy a central park penthouse? Or how many big-macs buy you a sedan? Or how much bitcoin do you need for an acre of aerable land?  
Graphed over time and corrected for over or undervaluations should give  a good insight in how capitalism is working out for the marketplace and society.

I have my cold storage as SegWit. Just wondering: will any future forks support SegWit too by design? I mean the more segwit addresses are on the chain, any snapshot should have the same addresses and people will be able to collect any new coins that might occur, right?  
Or can there be a politically or technically motivated descision for a forked coin NOT to support SW and though luck for those?

I withdrew this week. Went through within 24hrs.

Ah! Thank you.

I'm happy this was done. Bitcoin probably wouldn't be where it is today if didn't.

That is a disgustingly large cut. Most I've seen is about 130 euro to the full bitcoin. Kraken is an exchange and the difference there is between 0.25 and 1.00 euros depending on the supply/demand.  
You essentially set your own price on an exchange and if it is too far out of whack with what people are willing to pay/give your order will just sit there, unfulfilled.

I think it already has forked and is named bitcoin candy.
Edit: correction: it will fork at 512666.

I am in no way more qualified than you OP. But preceding the question, you make a statement: Google will be able to solve any math problem involving crypto in minutes. I have not read your source so that statement may be in there, but I am guessing this is the alleged BS part.
