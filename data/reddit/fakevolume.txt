andddd 4 minutes after i post this Barry tweets out that they indeed won 48k coins.  *pats self on back*
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:30:35
the general consensus here is that over time bitcoins will grow in value...possibly to even incredible levels.  However, after increasing by basically 10,000% in price last year, the price is down about 70% this year as the price "bubble" popped.  It is extremely volatile but decreasing in volatility over time.  Overall, No one knows if the value is going to go up, but this subreddit consists of tens of thousands who believe it will.

I wish posting news stories could generate some profit for me lol. I did earn reindeer droppings though (.05$)
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:28:24
lol ya i picked up the name after hearing all the conspiracies about the chinese trading with themselves
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:48:09
its a 24hr market so that 2.34% is meaningless as it just picks a single time of the day to mark a "new day" the price is range bound close to a 0 percent change. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 04:47:50
good call man i just grabbed some at 340 on stamp :)

if someone showed up at MIT offering to pay 75 dollars cash for the $100 in bitcoin, do you think students would sell?  (serious question)
@_date: 2014-12-15 18:09:32
worth noting that this "real" currency in a large country has lost 14.5 percent of its value TODAY.  Our make believe money is doing okay today
@_date: 2014-11-21 16:05:35
ok clearly the exact model would have to be refined a bit but you get the idea.  Do you have a better way of doing it
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:33:32
I guess 488.

sweet stats fail by Mozilla.  Bitcoin period had nearly twice the donation money as the non bitcoin period. They do not understand that larger numbers of visitors brought their donation numbers down on a "per person" basis (sample size).  Bitcoin itself  likely had zero net impact on this result.
@_date: 2014-12-02 21:00:08
You should start your presentation with a simple sign up screen for changetip and offer to tip your whole audience! not sure how this could work out but im sure one of the very smart people here could help.

If ESPN ends up tipping from their twitter account (14.1 million followers), I will probably faint.

@_date: 2014-11-11 19:42:18
ill ask then :)
@_date: 2014-11-25 19:20:38
honestly, this is an unbelievable idea.  We should have bots like this set up on virtually every major twitter account.  Imagine millions of bot messages a day educating on bitcoin!!!!! 
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:09:11
@_date: 2014-12-24 17:49:35
It would probably be a great idea to reccommend everyone set up a Changetip/bitcoin wallet and buy a few dollars in coin a few days prior to the next drawing.  Along with the simple Changetip transfers, you could also easily confirm who on reddit has donated, giving incentive for people to contribute.

@_date: 2015-01-27 18:21:15
Hmmm where should I donate?
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:33:17
Just an FYI it would never just start trading at 9:30 am. There would be an announcement in non trading hours that it will open the following day. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:47:48
the "rumor" on teamspeak is someone bid over 300 on the coins....
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:00:13
anyone who thinks that massive sells of multi-thousand coins in a minute is "profit-taking" does not really understand anything about these markets
@_date: 2015-03-19 19:37:01
This is awesome.  Imagine if the US mint stored cold wallets for the FED lol!!
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:49:22
relevant info: OTC market only trades until 4:00 pm EST each day.  If someone was going to sell they would have to put up an ask in the next 11 minutes. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:42:09
@_date: 2015-03-26 18:42:03
i wish i had answers....the fact that 4 market makers are involved in the bid/asks on the otc website is a promising sign it could trade in the next 24 hours
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:40:03
I like to think I am a relatively bright guy, but I follow Balaji on twitter and his brilliance discussing potential implications for bitcoin has me so overwhelmed sometimes...Sometimes you just have to trust people who are smarter than you lol..

Bitcoin. NASDAQ. PUMP PUMP!  kidding but interesting story
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:13:29
1) I recently heard of you as a competitor to LocalBitcoins
2) your process seems way more trustworthy and reliable. I have had heard so many negative reviews of your competitor. 
3) maybe there isn't enough people on there for bitquick to really be useful to me. But hopefully soon!!

someone bid 2000 a coin.
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:12:16
pretty sure if something like this was announced 18 months ago it would have moved the price like 300 dollars in a day....

how many bits til I can buy battlefield hardline off the microsoft store?
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:56:58
thats what they did haha...it looks like no one could deposit their shares in time to sell today so hopefully it happens tomorrow at 9:30
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:10:16
dear BIT holders of 12 months or more.  You can sell your shares for well over the current market value and simultaneously buy at the current market rate.  You keep your holdings at the same amount and instantly profit....you are welcome...
EDIT: BIDS ON $GBTC NOW AS HIGH AS $50 a share... equivalent to $500 per bitcoin. WOW. 
EDIT 2: highest BID now only at 35$ "only" a 100 dollar per coin premium on current price..
EDIT 3: $55 a share!!!!! /faints
EDIT 4 $200 a share. what is life.
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:36:11
Someone could theoretically sell their $250 dollar bitcoins for $2000 dollars per coin right now....

This is the type of news that won't change the price per coin anytime soon, but is awesome in terms of real world application and potential increased adoption. People who aren't aware of Twitch.Tv would be BLOWN away at how ridiculously popular streams can get
@_date: 2015-03-26 18:45:52
UPDATE- WSJ Article "trading is expected to begin early next week"
EDIT- $GBTC trading is LIVE.  no sells yet as $GBTC shareholders must deposit shares in their account and elect to sell.  my guess is no one will want to sell their shares for less than a significant markup over the current price.

Does anyone actually believe they have roughly 500,000 new customers? if they got 50,000 new customers that would be incredibly positive news for bitcoin.
