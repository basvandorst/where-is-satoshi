met a lot of the workers (and one of the co-founders) at a conference... super chill and almost motivated me to work for them!
I should've bit =/
@_date: 2014-07-03 20:55:30
dammit, that's the one I really wanted too :/
@_date: 2014-01-16 09:49:19
Anybody know how I can buy some Ron Paul coin?
@_date: 2014-02-16 03:40:41
the fact that you got downvoted and sourdsmokin got upvoted makes me lose even more faith in reddit...
@_date: 2014-07-15 17:47:36
I tried to buy something last night, but BTC isn't supported on newegg.ca yet :(
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:51:59
I think that was from December. A month prior he was mentioning [how Bitcoin was a bubble or fad](
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:41:17
wtf how is a mod? he is notorious even in in being completely insane

Met a bunch of the workers at a conference. They know their shit, and even better, know how to explain it to a room full of non-technical people.
@_date: 2014-03-05 04:08:19
Eh... I thought the same about Merryl Lynch

pretty damn good if you can last through the first dozen episodes... don't expect much in acting, but the twists and turns make me look forward to the new episode each week

So was I. I lost 14BTC when Bitfloor got hacked. From then on, I learned about private wallets. The fact that you're still having doubts makes me think you're not using private ones

Glad to see Peter Schiff has changed his opinion on Bitcoin. He used to be completely against the idea.

Communism requires a strong central government, hence why all the countries that try it become corrupt.
True capitalism requires a weak government, but the US keeps taking more and more powers.
@_date: 2014-02-10 00:44:01
wat? how come I didn't hear of this?!
@_date: 2012-12-03 06:56:16
Got my 1.7% back! I feel like those of us who still use BitFloor should get our reimbursements faster, or at least match our commission back.

Scan the deposit receipt and send it to support. That was the old way of doing things.
@_date: 2012-08-09 00:52:14
I highly recommend Bitfloor.com. Easy deposits (Chase or Wells Fargo) and support gets back to you almost instantly.
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:36:25
Learn how to use an offline wallet.

I learned my lesson at $14. I just bought 10 more today :D
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:55:26
I received mine yesterday. Plus the my referral received $5 too. Win-win!
@_date: 2013-07-08 07:14:12
lost about 13 bitcoins during the hacking... bought them at $14 each at the time, but just imagine if I had all 13 right now
still have $500 locked away, but it seems like he's allowing withdrawls again
@_date: 2013-08-12 17:41:27
Holy crap, I was wondering what that was!
@_date: 2013-08-22 04:39:48
be wary that many banks like BoA have a separate routing number for electronic deposits
@_date: 2013-02-03 22:19:13
Yup, set an amount you're comfortable with, and purchase at the price on Monday 9AM
@_date: 2013-06-07 22:34:33
$515.70 in USD and 12.619 in Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:50:09
... yes?
@_date: 2013-08-16 07:20:09
Yup. Even encouraged another friend to buy his first Bitcoin and spend it on the EA bundle
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:59:31
$8 here =)

Ex-Bitfloor user here.
Coinbase is just as easy, though it takes a week to get your coins. Not a problem if you're in it for investment purposes... but if you're using it for a flash purchase on some site, then look elsewhere.
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:26:44
Welcome, and please stay away from Mt. Gox... shady business there. If you're US-based, look into Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:46:51
Yup. Every time it drops, I pick up another coin.
@_date: 2013-08-20 09:31:14
I lost about 14 BTC when Bitfloor got hacked :(
@_date: 2013-08-17 06:13:53
I lost 14 BTC and got like 0.03 back...
