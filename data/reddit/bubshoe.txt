That's just a distributed ledger, we've been doing that for a while.
The key difference in bitcoin is the proof of work. Anyone can add lines to the ledger, but how they are ordered and validated is what sets bitcoin apart from any other service because it does not require a central authority.

Not only that but I believe the median size transaction is about 1 BTC.... Or $4500..
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:37:58
Its the simple fact that the exchanges only have so many bitcoins if a huge whale came to buy them all the price would sky rocket and the arbitrage traders would come in and would slowly sell that whale super expensive bitcoins until he would disappear. There are finite amount of coins. He probably couldn't buy 50,000 if he really wanted to because after the first 10,000 the price would be through the roof because there is only enough bitcoin in that exchange to meet a certain demand, if you exceed that demand(buy more than sell), the price goes up. only so many can be sold..

"In its purest form, currency is confidence. It's a network effect around an agreed-upon medium of exchange that has some promise of scarcity.

A lot of people find that more comforting than relying on the good faith of a government. In math we trust."

I think you are mistaken.. Cash is just a medium in which we exchange value.. Checks are closer to a bearer instrument, they bear rights or ownership. Cash is just the oil to the machine that is our economy. It enabled us to have the division of labor and specialized jobs. 
Cash started out as paper receipts for our gold deposits, but has changed drastically since then.

Median transaction size is ~1BTC or $4500.. So please give the transaction cost context. It's about size of the transaction as in how many bytes it is determines the (satoshi) /(byte) dollar cost.

@_date: 2017-11-02 06:04:32
It's a community that uses the a data structure, called a blockchain, to which we ascribe it value. With no one using it, it's literally worthless. 
It's completely voluntary unlike the US dollar. 
Bitcoin is certainly ideal money with regards to no one controls it directly. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:48:34
Meaning we have no choice but to transact through the dollar if we are to do transactions. I cite the US dollar because it's the world's reserve currency, but this can be applied to all fiat. We are forced to use their fiat to do business. There hasn't been an alternative currency to transact freely, privately, and *voluntary* since gold.
To your first point, you are free to start your own blockchain and pre mine it to have the most accumulated amount of work and longest sequence of blocks, but if no one uses it, it's worthless. Similar to if no one used bitcoin, it would be worthless. Miners wouldn't offer up real world resources for a virtual currency that no one uses.
Bitcoins value came naturally, not deemed by a government. It didn't start off valuable because of the trustless ledger, it started out worthless. As more and more people got into it for whatever reason, the market forces naturally came into work and someone asked to buy some.
This is what I mean by bitcoin being voluntary, not involuntary like our state controlled currencies. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:48:57

That was bitcoin 9 years ago. As smart as satoshi is/was, No one can tell the future of anything. The internet was made to share information between special businesses and schools, now look at the sheer number of cat videos.
As I'm not sure as to why the mining function was removed from core, but I think it's because miners at that point in the game were running specialized machines and their own mining software.
But any who, nodes still hold the power to enforce rules. So by running your own node and pointing your wallets towards it, your need to trust is diminished, knowing that your tx's being held to the same rule set as the rest of the network. It is then trustless, to the extent of your computer science knowledge. Sovereignty is only given to those who want it.

The following exchange was published in the British humor magazine, Punch, on April 3, 1957. It is reprinted here as an appropriate introduction and as a mental exercise to limber the mind for the material contained in this book.
 
Q. What are banks for?
A. To make money.
Q. For the customers?
A. For the banks.
 
Q. Why doesn't bank advertising mention this?
A. It would not be in good taste. But it is mentioned by implication in references to reserves of $249,000,000 or thereabouts. That is the money that they have made.
 
Q. Out of the customers?
A. I suppose so.
 
Q. They also mention Assets of $500,000,000 or thereabouts. Have they made that too?
A. Not exactly. That is the money they use to make money.
 
Q. I see. And they keep it in a safe somewhere?
A. Not at all. They lend it to customers.
 
Q. Then they haven't got it?
A. No.
 
Q. Then how is it Assets?
A. They maintain that it would be if they got it back.
 
Q. But they must have some money in a safe somewhere?
A. Yes, usually $500,000,000 or thereabouts. This is called Liabilities.
 
Q. But if they've got it, how can they be liable for it?
A. Because it isn't theirs.
 
Q. Then why do they have it?
A. It has been lent to them by customers.
 
Q. You mean customers lend banks money?
A. In effect. They put money into their accounts, so it is really lent to the banks.
 
Q. And what do the banks do with it?
A. Lend it to other customers.
 
Q. But you said that money they lent to other people was Assets?
A. Yes.
 
Q. Then Assets and Liabilities must be the same thing?
A. You can't really say that.
 
Q. But you've just said it. If I put $100 into my account the bank is liable to have to pay it back, so it's Liabilities. But they go and lend it to someone else, and he is liable to have to pay it back, so it's Assets. It's the same $100, isn't it?
A. Yes. But...
 
Q. Then it cancels out. It means, doesn't it, that banks haven't really any money at all?
A. Theoretically....
 
Q. Never mind theoretically. And if they haven't any money, where do they get their Reserves of $249,000,000 or thereabouts?
A. I told you. That is the money they have made.
 
Q. How?
A. Well, when they lend your $100 to someone they charge him interest.
 
Q. How much?
A. It depends on the Bank Rate. Say five and a-half per cent. That's their profit.
 
Q. Why isn't it my profit? Isn't it my money?
A. It's the theory of banking practice that...
 
Q. When I lend them my $100 why don't I charge them interest?
A. You do.
 
Q. You don't say. How much?
A. It depends on the Bank Rate. Say half a per cent.
 
Q. Grasping of me, rather?
A. But that's only if you're not going to draw the money out again.
 
Q. But of course, I'm going to draw it out again. If I hadn't wanted to draw it out again I could have buried it in the garden, couldn't I?
A. They wouldn't like you to draw it out again.
 
Q. Why not? If I keep it there you say if s a Liability. Wouldn't they be glad if I reduced their Liabilities by removing it?
A. No. Because if you remove it they can't lend it to anyone else.
 
Q. But if I wanted to remove it they'd have to let me?
A. Certainly.
 
Q. But suppose they've already lent it to another customer?
A. Then they'll let you have someone else's money.
 
Q. But suppose he wants his too ... and they've let me have it?
A. You're being purposely obtuse.
 
Q. I think I'm being acute. What if everyone wanted their money at once?
A. It's the theory of banking practice that they never would.
 
Q. So what banks bank on is not having to meet their commitments?
A. I wouldn't say that.
 
Q. Naturally. Well, if there's nothing else you think you can tell me...?
A. Quite so. Now you can go off and open a banking account.
 
Q. Just one last question.
A. Of course.
 
Q. Wouldn't I do better to go off and open up a bank?
And then the world turns from itself 90 degrees each way 3 times and disappears into the 4th dimension.

@_date: 2017-10-22 12:51:42
Block space being limited, you have to put a "priority fee" on your transaction, pretty much telling the miners "hey! My transaction is important, I need it confirmed!" With a high enough fee, the miner is more apt to include it in the block. Now this is a very basic explanation. There are a lot of other things that go into account when fees are being calculated, or what they are actually compensating(why there is a fee to begin with), but for the most part it's an anti attack parameter.
If the blocks were empty(meaning they are so big, they can fit all transactions from the mempool into a single block) why would anyone pay a fee? If There's no competition to get into the block, there is no incentive to pay a miner fee. Bigger blocks also have other possible downsides. 
With small blocks, you create a market based out of need and utility with people bidding to get their transactions into the block, creating a natural, healthy, and sustainable fee market. If you want to spam the network with 0 fee transactions, you may get lucky and get a tx(transaction just shortened) confirmed in 24 hours, but that depends on the market and if the mempool(the place where all pending and unconfirmed tx's reside in) is low. 
So with bitcoin, blocks get confirmed at an average of 10 minutes, with an average of 1800 - 2000 tx's per block(which is going up thanks to segwit!!). So if the mempool is really full and you don't pay enough of a fee, it might not get confirmed right away, thus having to wait for the subsequent blocks, with the hopes of it being confirmed then. 
Hope this helps. This space is crazy and it's hard to find good info. Andreas Antonopoulos is a wealth of knowledge. I'd recommend watching some of his videos to get a better understanding of why things are the way they are. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:00:55
Oops, thanks for the reply. So protocol ≠ software 
but software uses protocols? Did i get that right now?
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:48:27
And dude that's not even the half of it. So much more goes into how bitcoin works.
For example, how tx's are constructed correlates exactly to how big of a fee you pay. Wallets take that into consideration when constructing a tx and usually create the cheapest possible tx. They do that by taking (generally) 1 UTXO and creating 2 UTXOs. What's a UTXO? It's where your coins actually reside. It's the "state" of the blockchain. Meaning it's all of the possible valid unspent coins. With the wallets incentivized to create the smallest fee for your tx, it creates this problem of "bloating the UTXO set". This by default makes full nodes (the nodes that listen and relay fully self validated blocks) just a tad bit slower because it has more data to look through. 
Some think that's not a big deal but down the road it would lead to even higher fees, bigger tx'(data wise), and slower parsing time for the nodes, making the network as whole, slower. This has been an ongoing problem that the core devs addressed with segwit. It is helping by giving the witness discount to segwit tx's so that wallets have the incentive to *decrease* the UTXO set by taking multiple UTXOs and spending them to one address, creating a big tx in regards to actual size in bytes of data it has to include referencing all the previous addresses of those coins.
I hope that helps a little!

Dude I know  they are "mined", and that term is just an anaolgy to make sense to the masses, they really just sequence and validate transactions and are compensated with the block reward and fees.
So you're telling me that Coinbase would return my BTC if they get hacked because they are insured? Do you realize what you are even saying? If they lose your keys, your coin is gone forever. No amount of "insurance" can cover lost BTC, unless they replace every single BTC they lost with lovely fiat or an IOU.
You cannot insure BTC with BTC unless you have a 1:1 ratio, which they won't and never will, because they are too big, with too many customers.

My "aha!" moment came after having my credit card hacked. 
I was hanging out at a friend's house, took a hit of acid and watched "catch me if you can" with Tom Hanks and Leonardo dicaprio. 
Realizing that a kid with absolutely no education could wreak havoc on a fiat monetary system because he knew how to counterfeit!? Then wheels were starting to turn..  Then I went on thinking on how the fat protocol of bitcoin works without submitting sensitive info over the web, as compared to using a cc.
Then combining these two thoughts together was my the moment my walls fell. seeing how identify theft is a [terrible, but accepted consequence] ( to the way we live doesn't have to continue. We now how bitcoin/cryptocurrencies.

Not really centralized. Most are independently wealthy, and consensus has to be reached to add improvements to the protocol. If consensus isn't reached, bitcoin stays the same.
Anyone can add to the development of bitcoin. This is open source, if you can hold your own in programming, by all means submit a BIP. Code in the changes you think bitcoin needs, get consensus from other developers on how the idea and code are sound, and then set up 0.3.0 nodes on up and test, test, test. See if you really think that development is centralized.

its removed from the tx and commited to the witness data which is apart of the coinbase. the signature is still part of the block, just in a different part of it.
As smart as Satoshi is/was, the 400+ devs that help contribute to the bitcoin core github probably have a greater understanding in many more aspects of the protocol than 1 man did. 
Ever hear the saying 2 heads are better than 1? Well it applies in computer science/distrubuted systems/applied cryptography too.

So far, regardless of price and difficulty, more hash rate has always been added to the BTC network, and only really dipped when the clone BCH came out. So the  miners  gamex that chain hard and hyper inflated those coins.
Edit : And sometimes you dont always find a block in 10 minutes regardless of hash rate on the BTC chain.. It's an average of 10 minutes a block.

Market cap is a terrible metric to go by. Just like the other comments said, it's just (total issued) x (current market price). That's it.
There was nothing "organic" about its growth. The market is only 2 months old on that coin and most trading of it goes down in Asia. Really I think it's just speculative trading, not utility demand.

What bitcoin and other cryptos are doing, that i don't think the state will be able to replicate, is the fact that in public blockchains vs private blockchains, public will always win.
The reason BTC has value is not because it was "decreed" or "forced upon us", its because the value of it came organically through the market. Meaning for the first 10 months bitcoin was around, it sold for $0, nobody wanted to buy it. It was just fun money. Slowly though the market recognized its  value and started trading it. So value came naturally through the market, and has only be bolstered more by the wallets, exchanges, mining, merchants, and users.
Now with the "private blockchain" or a "state-chain", how can i guarantee that the chain is what it says it is? There is no way to validate the chain. It might look good from the inside, being a cool way to store data, but from the outside, I can not be sure that everything is the way it should be. The idea of "blockchains" loses its credibility when it goes private.
Public chains don't have that problem because they are created with the intent that *most, if not all, actors are bad*. They are designed with that in mind, and layout the parameters so that everyone's incentives are aligned. They are designed in a way that you can transact, validate, and keep a record of it all for yourself, knowing at someplace somewhere, there is someone offering up real world resources(mining with electricity), for the chance to find a block. This guarantees that I know work was done to find a block, which is only further solidified when my node validates the block which was propogated.
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:51:03
But really though why the fuck are we arguing computer science? 
The argument(from the bitcoin cash side) has no technical merit as to how to scale. 
"More TX? Bigger blocks! Let's not worry about the growing UTXO set, or possible furthering miner centralization, or writing code that makes legacy nodes incompatible, or code in a feature that lets miners game the system by hyperinflation mining then abadoning. We want low fees right now! We are satoshi's vision! "
See the shitty argument they have? It's steeped in politics, and vastly far from any empirical superiority over the "core" chain.
So I'll say it again, why are we arguing politics over something that is scientific?

But it does have one unique ability that gold doesn't offer. You can send it through a line of communication.

Asic. Application specific integrated circuit.. So you attack, break the network, everyone leaves. Mission success.. and then the hardware needs to be re proposed or scrapped, hence why it'd be worthless over night if the attack would be successful.

because of coercion.

What about network propagation of the blocks? Won't it take longer?

This.

To bad I'm on the east coast.. I'd love to do this.

That's the million dollar question. Some say yes, others say no.

Regardless, it would be nice having lower fees again, let's activate segwit and move the bulk of tx's off chain and we can micropayment all day long. Boom problem solved.

See that was the thing, you didn't go to some random drug dealer, it was like ebay, everyone had ratings and reviews, you would know if a particular seller had good stuff, or bunk stuff. Really it was harm reduction at its finest.

Regardless, if you don't test your drugs yourself you still have no one else to blame but yourself.

Are you complaining about the amount of cat videos being uploaded to the Internet?  Don't think the creators of the Internet had that in mind. Don't think they wanted billions of photos of child porn circulating around it either, but that's what was done with it. 
Bitcoin is a tool, how it serves the market, depends on the market. You do realize that the median transaction size is 1 BTC...So the majority of the market really doesn't care about a 5 dollar fee.

Damn. Is that physically possible? I thought quantum tunneling becomes a problem at that size nm.
