Found this to be a more recent post on Blockstream so thought Id take a shot: how the hell do I withdraw/transfer to an exchange from [blockstream.info](
I simply cannot find any withdraw/transfer functions when punching in my address. Can you help? Thanks!

Sorry, I asked too many questions in this post. To which question are you saying yes too? Thanks.

**A parallel:** You think steak prices will go up in the future from the $10 / lbs it is today.
So you go to your neighborhood butcher and say, *"Hey, I'll sign a contract to buy 10 lbs of steak from you at $15/lb today - but you don't have to deliver it until July 4th."* The butcher agrees.
It's now July and because of weather, the cost of gas, a resurgence of mad cow disease, and other affects, the cost of steak is $20/lb - you win having to pay $15/lb and not $20/lb.
In an alternate situation Gal Gadot, Chance the Rapper, Key &amp; Peele, and other influential people say *"Steak is bad; eat more guinea fowl"* effectively driving down the demand and price of steak to $8/lb - you lose having to fulfill that contact and pay $15/lb and not $8/lb.
In one other situation you are confident that the price of steak in July will increase but not sure by how much so while watching March Madness together, you tell your neighbor, *"Hey, I have a deal with the butcher to buy 10 lbs of steak from him at $15/lb in July... I locked that in on December 10th because you know, the price is going to go up... since the family and I will not be around for the 4th I'll sell you that deal I have with the butcher for..."*
* *"...$12.50/lb because you're my buddy."* - you're getting out and mitigating your losses - bad assumption on the price of steak going up.
* *"...$15/lb; just take it off my hands."* - you're getting out and mitigating your losses - bad assumption on the price of steak going up.
* *"...$18/lb. Did I say $15/lb, buddy? I meant $18/lb."* - despite your assumption that it will go to $20/lb, you'd rather have a sure thing than gambling for another 3-4 months.
* *"...$20/lb. Why $20/lb? You seen da prices at the market this week?! It's already $19/lb; imagine what it'll be in 3-4 months?! "* - you're **not** a good friend... but a great investor.
