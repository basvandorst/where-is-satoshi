My newsfeed this AM is full of news that this guy sold all his coin this AM. I assume it's real?  Does it actually mean much?  Plus side BCash is up so a good time to sell it.
Is this as scary for Bitcoin as they make it sound?

I posted a Forbes article elsewhere on this thread.  It's partly why I came here for clarification.  The tone of the article is like some bigwig bitcoin guy just lost all faith in the coin and cashed out.  It's not even until you get half way through the article you realize he's swapping coins, not completely bailing... and then it clicks... he hasn't been a bitcoin guy for a while.

Where the fees hurt is when you decide to spend alot from your wallet with a ton of .1 (or .01 for those who are poor) transactions from mining. 
Although last time this all happened things settled and fees were more reasonable after a week. (But could still use some improvement).

You'd think they would be on top of that to save on their own transaction fees.  Bundling intuitively makes a lot of sense even if they are oddly afraid of Segwit.

Some people down play the high risk high volitile nature of Bitcoin. But it sounds like you understand that and are doing what's right for you. Thay said, housing interest rates are likely to start rising and don't underestimate the compound savings of paying off earlier rather than later. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:17:21
It pays in the currency you are mining for. What's unique about nicehash is you might be supplying the hashing power for altcoinX but they are paying you in Bitcoin. Basically someone is paying you to hash the coin they want.  But nice hash handles it all in the background so you just need to worry about running the software.

Mortgage loans can be fixed, variable (attached to prime) or mixed. Up here in Canada there can be some big penalties for paying off fixed rate between terms, variable is typically 3 months interest.  Variable typically tends to be cheaper long term, but some people prefer the stability of fixed. Most mortgages get renewed every 5 years the rate gets renegotiated then.  So if rates jump even on fixed you can expect to have a higher rate on renewal. I heard American mortgages are tax deductible (I'm not sure if that's universal or not) whereas we don't get that in Canada so there maybe be some advantages like that for keeping a mortgage that we don't get. Bank of Canada has been hinting strongly of yearly prime rates going up about a percent a year for the the next several years. Its gone up twice by .25 each time this year already.

Pretty much what I was gonna say. Its a gamble. If miners go elsewhere difficulty could slow. Mine for the experience or the fun of it. Cross your fingers Bitcoin increases in value before you cash out. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:20:53
I would probably work in there that alot of people use it as a long term investment but it is also possible to spend at a small but growing numbers of businesses. 
When I talk to family I'm always up front that the currency is volitile, there's always a risk it crashes but the general hope is it expands in the medium and long terms. Anyone who has invested has probably heard the speil before. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:57:53
Too bad your getting down voted. Its a relevant comment as wallets with lots of inputs suffer alot more.  Someone moving 100 BTC might pay two dollars, but someone moving 0.3 BTC but with 100 inputs (old school mining) might be paying 30 bucks in fees. This even though both users are paying the same x sat/byte. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:57:01
I think individuals can still mine but the investment and risk is too great for myself. (But not with GPUs).
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:05:14
4 if you're not.
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:19:22
This is true. Perhaps stabilization of the coin would help too. But even then it seems alot of equipment is replaced 6-12 months. That's not great for the environment.   
That said I'm guilty as charged for contributing a small part to this. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:46:41

Too bad GPU mining is dead or headed that way. He could have bought her a mining setup.

How upset would you be if it dips first?  Or it takes 2 years to hit 10k? Or gets stuck at 6k.  It boils down to your risk tolerance.

When you call him from your yaht he'll be convinced!  That said Bitcoin is high risk as far as investments go. Its very volitile, it's certainly going to drop for a while at some point. I have seen it go from $700 to below $300. It's gone up so much this month a 2-4k drop sometime in the next year (even of gradual) would not surprise me.  That's why so many people here recommend holding with the hope the long term increases will be greater than any short term loss.  I guess your friend should fact check if most new purchases are actually short term investors as he says. 
He's right to be skeptical. Google Bitcoin scam and see all the money that's been stolen.  Bitcoin is new, innovative and exciting and that's why we love it but an ounce of caution, level headedness and skepticism will help keep people safe and not invest more than they can afford.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:51:35
If we are gonna have a fork every month it's gonna get tiring moving Bitcoin to a safe wallet before dumping the new coin. I'm actually amazed the fork coins get to a value where it's worth the effort. 
It'd be nice to get a trusted BTC centric wallet that supports the alt coins for the purpose of moving and selling the alt coin without having to worry about comprising the BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:03:32
Honestly I don't know as I don't use either Electrum. I only came across the warning while researching options. 
If you transfer all your BTC to a new wallet and use the BCH wallet on another computer that's the safest according to that warning. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:36:03
To be fair. Lots of people have used it and there's been no reports of problems. But an ounce of caution never hurts. There have been alot of scams recently so securing BTC in a new wallet before cashing in any form of fork is probably prudent. It just further complicates things. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:14:33
I was just checking out Blockchain and I noticed it said 1 transaction.  Looking at it closer it reads like a blank block and they just got the mining credit.  Is this a bug?  I'm no technical expert with bitcoin so maybe I'm missing or not understanding something.  But it just seems odd.

What does the little ? say when you hover. Is that network fee in addition to the one you set in your wallet?  It really shouldn't cost them to receive beyond their web infrastructure. If they treated it like a credit card steam would pay a percentage not you. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:28:23
Energy isn't unlimited.  If the supply can't meet the demand prices will go up to reduce the demand.  Alot of miners will stop if you triple the power costs.

Would he be a bad father if he got her a Bitcoin Cash Coin?
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:12:28
That's what I was kinda thinking.  I guess mining could be seen as a sign of interest in the coin.  In terms of securing the network hash is just one measure.  As is number unique miners / pools.  As is distribution of nodes validating the miners work.  I just hear people talking about mild reduction of difficulty like it's a bad thing and I'm not convinced it is.  If anything it will help extend the useful life of current equipment.
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:26:57
Are you trying to convert us to Ethereum?  Let's see how that plays out first. :)
I'm sure someone can speak to why proof of stake has its advantages too. But you'd be talking about a fundamental change of the coin which would be difficult to swallow. I guess one consideration (which market efficiency pushes things to) is using "free" renewable energy. Some startups are by hydro dams and solar panels. If I power my rig with a Tesla solar roof and battery it's way better for the environment. Bitcoin's problem isn't unique than many industrial and lifestyle choices. Can we mitigate the same through smarter energy design?
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:14:32
I'm kinda curious how much BTC his phone does make in a week.  If he's really that eager and has a decent GPU he should look into nicehash.  Still not big bucks, but actually enough after a few months he could buy a computer game or something.  (But smarter to HODL).
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:09:43

About the same feasibility of said local people pointing a gun at your head until you give 'em the coin for free. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:41:34
Its exposed to whatever software processes the BCH wallet / keys. If you accidentally picked a compromised route then they have your BTC as well. 
FYI "Electrum's" BCH wallet was not done by the developers at Electrum BTC wallet. It was wise to move your BTC first. They actually said don't have the two programs on the same computer.  Their caution can be read here: 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:54:11
So does that mean HODL BCH so I can dump when the pump peaks?
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:19:45
Its an issue for sure.  Sorry for the rambling post. I got thinking "outloud" and couldn't stop. 
The whole system is an arm's race for maximum proof of work for maximum profit. This means increased electrical use.  I used to worry about this a bit with BOINC/SETI But with Bitcoin the profit motive encourages enterprising people to ramp up their usage. 
I'm not really sure what the solution is. I wonder if Satoshi envisioned data centers of coin miners or if he thought people would be satisfied with what they had already at home. The issue is indirectly related to mining power being concentrated to those who can afford the startup and electrical costs of these major operations. 
Perhaps the incentives to mine are too great?  The node portion of the network operates under a mix of altruistic contribution and "trust no one" so run the node yourself in addition to it being essential infrastructure for for-profit exchanges.  The solution is way beyond my ability to propose what technologically would work. But maybe mining needs to feel more like BOINC and less like business?

There's a sci-fi adventure in here. " In a dystopian future where Bitcoin is King there is a rumour of a hard drive with the private keys of the wallet holding the unspent coins from the first Bitcoin block.  Under the Ocean in the lost city of New York our hero begins their journey. "

If you factor in hydro, GPU mining and Bitcoin just don't work.  I'm not even sure if you'd make back the cost of the card in reasonable time.  Even with ASICs you have to be careful. You probably could GPU some alt coins and make a little bit.  I mined ETH with my 2 year old GPU and it was worth it for a few months. Not crazy amounts but fingers crossed the coin increases in value. 
If his budget is $1000 he could probably get an ASIC that would last until next Christmas. Electricity is a factor. But could be fun. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:23:41
I'm ready to dump. I can't figure out how to safely. Putting my BTC private keys / wallet.dat into any of the BTH wallet programs seems really risky to me. I got really paranoid about who to pick after reading Electron's warning that the Electron Cash wallet isn't them. What is one to do?
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:04:42
That's brutal. Hopefully with some more payment processors onboard the competition will bring lower fees. Too bad steam didn't do an in house solution. Think of the money they would have made if they kept some and HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:18:59
The difficulty to mine is set by the network. So even if hashing power stagnated or even reduced because of reduced coin pricing it should be ok as long as it doesn't happen over night. In terms of decentralization it'd probably be preferred that 10000 hobbiests make $50 a month with their futuristic GPUs than massive computing centres making thousands. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:47:56
Bitcoin core was recommending 100 satoshis for 20 minute confirmations, 17 for 3 day and 6 for more than a week. I eyeballed the block chain and went with 13. I got confirmed in 6 hours and it seems I coulda done better for pricing. Alot of people could have saved money. I kinda look at it as whoever payed the lowest in a block wins and everyone else overpaid. (Because if they paid the same they likely would have made it into that block anyways).
I was wondering to myself if we just took the existing pending transactions how long would it take to complete those?  Maybe we just need to agree on a standard fee.  Others can bid higher but if 60 or 70 percent of us agreed and picked something arbitrary our transactions would all make it through in due time. Probably better than people trying to just slightly outbid others. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:24:29
After 7 months you might not have much more useful mining unless the difficulty rates. Do it for fun, but really run the numbers first. 
Also look into mining alt coins and selling those for Bitcoin. Might get a better ROI.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:38:46
You would need a half decent graphics card to be worth while. Maybe time to build a budget gaming rig?  Check out some of the 2-300 graphics cards and you can go to nicehash and see some very tough estimates. You won't be rich but $20-100 a month of Bitcoin could be achievable depending on the card you get. Plus you can play games and not struggle with photo shop.
