It's more of a value based on a promise. It's not physical. It's decentralised so no one can help you if someone hacks, steals, gun to head style robs you. But the fact there's no managing organisation is why it's so incredibly sought after right now. It's making ripples in the ocean that is the financial world on a global level. Anyone can own it and you can send it to anyone on the planet.
Edit. I mean it is a crime yes. It is still a crime.

I temporarily sold. Didn't want to be in a scenario where that decision was taken away from me for downtime whilst it may have dipped. Got pretty ~~exciting~~ heated during that time.

Coinbase can't handle it. Fucking mad I can't even get a choice to buy / sell right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:30:45
Doesn't really matter. Just dont lie.

Same here! Felt like I was doing bad, but there's never going to be a 'right' time.

Hey, I'm reasonably new, starting to pick up segwit and beginning to understand it. Any quick fast way of knowing the difference between the two addresses just by looking at them? How did you know? Please excuse my ignorance. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:09:03
PLS SIR!!

Are you temporary limited to a smaller amount? Sometimes this is the case.

I have 10 IOTA too!

Sorry, its good for me to workout bitcoin to USD vs GBP. Just saw your comments about money vs BTC. Use google "0.001 BTC in USD" it brings up the calc you are looking for. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:38:09
I mean who WOULDNT sell at those profits. Would be so incredibly hard to hold on. Even though you know its going to continue.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:54:48
Is he really selling at that? I'll take one.

Coinbase has Meeehhhh fees but super easy intuitive UI. 
If you buy tonnes, download Eletrum Bitcoin Wallet and pay a very small fee to transfer you coins there so they are offline and safe.

This is crazy &gt; sending my LTC to Bittrex and same issue. Every goddamn time I wanna send elsewhere. "Unsupported currency"??? Its a community of wallet to wallet transfers. Madness how they can fuck up this big. 2:52am GMT

Watching this now. So, so strange.

I waited then because of the "all time high". It's all about the present. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:07:10
Sorry, yeah if you use Coinbase on the phone app, when you click the paper plane, there is a field to send &amp; QR code button to scan. 
I have the destination address open on my laptop and just scan it. 
If on desktop just copy and paste. Look, compare, compare once more, then you are good :)

Ahh not my first intention. Everyone thought I was crazy. I guess I'm trying to reference that quote about 30 years ago was the best time to plant a tree, but today is the second best time?

It's 10% to transfer out if I send to the Coinbase wallet?? Man this blows.

I literally got mesmerised by this yesterday during the chaos that was a normal day in current day Bitcoin.

Exactly. Reddit is a place for community, not making money. If someone can't ask a question on Reddit, god help us. 
Talking of jerking off, what's your favourite Subreddit

I can't answer as I don't have one. Decent savings on the ledger, but don't keep everything in one place. I would lock that in a fire-proof safe for sure. 
I think I would keep some on the exchange just incase.

I'm from the UK and bought BTC with our GBP. I then transferred this to another exchange and traded for USD and vice-versa for other alt coins. No real problem, every exchange and every currency differs. You are free to take this currency anywhere. 
My end game is to get it all back to a UK exchange where I can (one day) withdraw. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:49:51
I tend to get Litecoin as the fee to send (Exchange &gt; exchange) is incredibly small. 
edit. Then trade for BTC / Alt coin
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:43:22
Apple Stocks says it hit $19,300 today. Coinbase did not acknowledge this. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:43:22
Everyone is just stopping and staring. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:42:10
I ended up getting this. Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:57:09
You should buy $100 of Bitcoin. Then look at buying IOTA or XRB or another alt coin with it for a potential future win. 
Or sit on it. It may lull, but most people just keep on buying through the dips. There's never a "good" time. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:31:15
Here friend  . 
I also have it added to my stocks app on the iPhone under BTCUSD=X 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:56:39
That $1500 will be worth $15k. What's bad about that?

Does anyone have the wallet ID? Do these 1 million coins exist on a wallet you can lookup?

It's different now, even between Bitfinex and Coinbase for example. (USD)
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:09:47
It went super high. Like insane high, then dipped a little but still 27% up in 24 hours.

Nice community spirit. Not all people are like this op ^_^ 
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:07:34
After reading the comments, the mass adoption and those that are unprofitable are the people that need to trust BTC again for it to grow even higher. Lots of new people joined in the 2017 boom and those are the ones who are down. You could say the most important people are the ones on negative scales right now.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:05:32
These are the people that need to trust in BTC again.
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:37:09
Statistically correct. IRL no. So many people got in $10k + / purchased in more recent years than older years.
