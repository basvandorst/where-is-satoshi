How is that you get Real BTC from Fake Money?

"I don't think" might be the truest statement he's made.

Doesn’t everyone? And every 15 minutes there after?

For me personally, I would get rid of half of my stash if the price got anywhere close to the $1000 mark again. Even just barely passing $900. I owe money to people that I borrowed from to buy Miners. Oh how I regret not selling some at over $1000 cuz I thought we were going to the MOON, now we're &lt;$500. This sucks balls.

Where is that from? I wouldn't mind buying one.

I'm sure you'll get your miners if you already paid them. The hacking is someone removing coins from user accounts.
I'm sure they'll have a lot better security for their [Bitmain] own coins that they receive.

This is the LTC address all my coins went to

I can confirm this is true. I've also received this email. 
I've also been trying to deal with them for the past two weeks about someone hacking my account and stealing all my BTC and LTC.
The only help I've gotten from Support desk has been to reset my password and 2FA, everytime I've asked about stolen funds, they've avoided the subject completely, and now that my password and 2FA has been reset, they are ignoring any further replies from me regarding my funds. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:25:21
I highly doubt they will give any kind of refund, I can't even get them to acknowledge that my account was hacked. 
Even a partial refund would be fine with me, or provide me some hashing power instead to recover some of the massive losses. But I won't hold my breath, they don't exactly fall in the "Good guy" category. They are only concerned with their greed.

My situation was very, lets say, fishy. I did have 2FA active on my account, but Google Authenticator was not working. I opened the support ticket originally because of that. They told me to reset with the SMS system, which wasn't working.
They eventually disabled my 2FA (because that is what I requested so that I could reset it), I was not able to reset the Google Authenticator due to the SMS error. 
I sent a reply back saying that I could not reset due to SMS error.
Now here is the fishy part... they reset my 2FA around 1:30am EST, around 2:30PM someone hacked my account with a Chinese IP address, didn't see to do anything, then I see another login from Indonesia IP address who transferred out 79 LTC's, then a little while later, another login from Germany who put in a order for my 1.03 BTC's in the Hasnest exchange for LTC's. Then another login from India who withdrew the now exchanged 74 LTC's, and then another India login who withdrew whatever little amounts of LTC I was earning from the LTC hashing power I own. 
At this point is when I checked my email and saw the email notifications that I had so many withdrawals. I logged in right away and changed my password and pin to something a lot more complicated and started withdrawing whatever I as earning every couple of hours (which really wasn't much). 
I just find it extremely fishy that someone knew to hack into my account as soon as the 2FA was deactivated, and the first login IP is a Chinese IP address. I just can't shake the feeling that it was an inside from from someone from the help desk. 
There were over $250k worth of LTC's transferred to that address, so this has been going on for a while with a bunch of people, and Bitmain's help desk won't even reply to the subject of theft.
I know I'm going to get bashed for leaving my coins in there, that it was my fault, which I own up to. It is partially my fault for trusting they could keep my coins safe, but to not even acknowledge that all those coins were stolen from me, and that something will be done about it, I just find it unacceptable.

Link to original video...For science...?

I literally got the same this morning. You beat me to posting it.
@_date: 2019-04-15 19:31:29
Anyone bought from them before?

I don't know why people keep giving all these negative advises instead trying to be helpful.
Depending on where you are located, how many solar hours you get per day, and cost of the panels and equipment, what may be a more logical solution is a hybrid system.
The way I had a small system set up is via a Grid-Tie system.
I only did a small scale concept trial, and never went all out due to budget required.
A hybrid system would be to max out  your solar panels with the total consumption of your miner's plus any appliances (if it is at home for example), for the solar hours you receive.
Best option would be if your power company gives you credit when you over produce power and feed the grid instead. In this manner, you can over produce power for your solar hours, and build credit towards the hours you are not producing any energy.
This method will not bring your power bill to $0.00 unless you really really overbuild your solar farm to earn you enough credit to cover the hours where the solar panels are not producing any power.
Solar panels are usually rated to last around 25 years or more, the rest of the equipment... you'll probably be lucky to get 5-8 years out of them.
In the long run, this plan would benefit you whether you believe in Bitcoin or not, you will have a source of income from your power company even if you stop mining.

Can I has some too? :-D Thank you!

Ya, except that BTC chart conveniently stops at 2017 (not even at its peak) while Dow Jones is recent, all to make the charts fit some perceived view.

Why the hell is ANY kind of upward rise, by even a little bit, getting called a bull run?
It's so irritating.
Can people please wait till it goes up a grand or two before calling it a bull run?
In the last 6 months, every time price goes up by $200, people start screaming BULL RUN!
