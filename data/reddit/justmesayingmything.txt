I am not going to lie, I am not feeling chill.  Transactions stuck in the blockchain for days, ridiculous fees.  For people who hold bitcoin sure its no biggie, for people who are trying to get bitcoin out daily, weekly etc,  it's a nightmare right now.  I am not new to bitcoin, not stressed about the price going down a bit, but I am extremely stressed about the fact that you can't move anything.

I tried to post a thread basically explaining why bitcoin is getting hard for me to use and how I use it. The moderators banned it because they said I was talking about altcoins that pretend to be bitcoin.  For the love of goodness. Meanwhile I wasn't being negative about bitcoin just giving what I think is constructive criticisms the developers should consider because I want bitcoin to  prosper and not just for those that HODL.  There will be an effect for those people too, if people who use it others ways are just cut off.

That's surprising I have had quite a few successful transactions with them over the years. It has been a while since I used it though.  What did they block you on?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:12:51
Well I am glad for you, that has not been the case for me and it's getting worse as each week goes by.  I love bitcoin but it is starting to feel unsustainable the way I use it which is not to just sit it in a wallet and HODL.  I can't keep continuing to take money out of my families mouth just to feel like I stand for something.

I have made it through Synchronizing with Network and Building Databases the loop for me is just happening with Scan transaction history.
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:01:28
That's what I was thinking maybe it's because the price is going down, but in the real world of investing that doesn't make much sense. Buy low sell high.  Bitcoin people seem to have the opposite theory for some reason.
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:01:46
Thank you, will give this a look over :-)

I have done an advertisement with no luck.  On top of that every buyer I have contacted has 100% positive feedback, they just let the escrow run it's course and never make contact.  There is no feedback on that site until a transaction is complete which means there is no feedback from people except people who they have not ignored.
I have past transactions with good feedback.  Release escrow within minutes of being paid.  It's driving me NUTS!!  Meanwhile I have stuff my kids need before school starts and it's all relying on selling these bitcoins.
I really love bitcoin and have been a supporter all along but starting to think it's really not worth it at all.
@_date: 2014-09-14 16:58:58
ok I will double check, also sent a ticket through the developer website.  
So frustrating because this bitcoin was worth so much more the day it was sent back to me than it is today :-(
@_date: 2014-09-19 14:25:16
Yeah I find a lot of information that helps me estimate.  I have even found many minor sites that give me their own stats.  But I basically am seeing how long it takes them to get to the next 25 and then would have to add all those up and that only tells me one miner.
I am really looking for a chart that has actual bitcoins mined each day by everyone for the last year or so.  I am thinking it must not exist.
@_date: 2014-09-14 18:46:20
thanks gonna read it!

We have tried this it allows us to load it but it still won't give us private keys.  Everything seems to be impossible to do until the updating finishes and at this point I don't think it ever will.
Needless to say if/when I ever get my bitcoin back I won't be using Armory anymore.
@_date: 2014-09-14 16:14:38
When I try to do that there are no keys.  However, I know the keys were there before this started.
@_date: 2014-09-14 16:19:42
Can you clarify, not sure what you mean.
@_date: 2014-09-25 04:18:00
I will be honest, I am looking to avoid doing the math and the hours of research.  Especially a year's worth!!  
That said I am pretty surprised this isn't out there already.  Knowing the supply of any market it absolutely key. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 16:56:04
Yes, I have just here on Reddit though, and just this morning so hoping he will respond.  
I do have the latest version.
Edit: Just sent a support ticket as well.

Can I get the URL? If you are not allowed to post it here can you please PM it to  me?

Localbitcoin or bitcoin ATM.

I was referring to my very first post where I laid out if you want it to come as USD then this is a better option.  I said if you are cryptocurrency savvy or want to hold BTC then you already have good answers in this thread.  
Maybe he does want to hold a few small payments a month in BTC and it won't hurt him at all or maybe he is already running his business at a loss and this would just put him further in that hole.  I don't know the answer to that and neither do you but either are possibilities.

I already acknowledged this is not a popular opinion here.  That said I have had TONS of people scam me out of thousands of dollars in bitcoin over the years.  But never once has my coin not showed up on my bitpay card or have I ever not received a processed client payment in my bank account. There fees are insane often and their exchange rates are often way out whack, but never been scammed out of  dollar and to a small business that's important.

Check out this thread on the tax subreddit.  It's not the actual amount you owe tax on you need to pair it with another form that will end up showing your actual gains/losses for your tax liability.

I am not assuming, I said IF and you don't know this guy or his life.  Again not all people hold and hodl bitcoin.  You are assuming, not me.

You guys are never going to get mainstream adoption expecting businesses who want to accept your coin to run full nodes on their own servers.  I offer logical advice to this person if they are A) not cryptocurrency savvy and B) have no intention of keeping the money in bitcoin.
I get all the reasons for your links.  I understand all the issues with bitpay if you are don't fit either of those criteria.  I also understand that a business owner who needs his revenue hitting his account every day can't be reasonably expected to learn everything you need to know to run it the "proper" way.  
Real answer to this question is just don't accept bitcoin it's not ready for small business implementation in this way yet but the user didn't ask for opinions on that, he asked for ways to push forward anyway. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 13:38:20
Hence the reason this martial arts studio has no good reason to accept bitcoin.  But someone who has bitcoin has likely asked for the option.  He is likely trying to fill a customers need.  Maybe I am wrong and he is perfectly capable of running a proper setup and navigating exchanges etc, in which case I did say there are already good suggestions in this thread. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 08:03:40
If your employer and/or their web developer is cryptocurrency  savvy and your employer wants to keep the money in bitcoin then you already got some good answers. 
If none of that is true and your employer just wants a simple way for customers to pay in bitcoin that shows up in his bank account just like his credit card payments do then a better option is probably bitpay.  
I will likely get downvoted for this answer but this subreddit is often not sensitive to the fact that not all people just buy and hold cryptocurrency. I for one use cryptocurrency as a income stream so it comes in and goes out which is likely how a small business would use it.  In a world of zero regulations there is a lot of fraud with pools, exchanges, etc.  There are also technical issues that can pop up with wallets that a unseasoned user will never anticipate or understand.
Most small businesses can't accept this kind of risk for their revenue, which is why companies like bitpay are likely a better choice if the business can't or doesn't want to risk said money disappearing into thin air but wants to offer their customers options.

Do you know what the turn around time is from when I transfer money in from my wallet until it hits my bank with coin base?
@_date: 2018-07-13 13:40:43
Also to add, what do you think this business should do accept payments they can never put in the bank to pay their bills?  Businesses don't work like that.  I mean unless he can pay his rent or his light bill or his insurance with bitcoin, he would literally be providing services with no revenue.

Eh a few probably are mentally insane I will give you that, but I won't vote for them either.
@_date: 2015-09-09 21:08:21
He's a drug addict and most likely mentally insane.  Seriously, we can do better than this for president.  There is a lot more to running the free world than knowing what bitcoin, IPV6 and reddit are.

That is probably it because she said it was about all sorts of financial stuff.
@_date: 2015-02-12 23:37:17
She actually has her own debit card.  She wanted one and a few years ago I told her if she got her savings up to $200 I would let her switch to the account that uses a card.  It took her a while but she got there.
But I think bitcoin would be a great next step in learning about different and new kinds of money.
@_date: 2015-02-13 15:37:28
She is 11
@_date: 2015-02-13 15:46:27
Basically what I told her is that (and keep in mind I a no mining expert) she didn't do the math problems that her computer did.  I explained that you set up a computer or processor and allow some or all of the resources to work on the problems.   As sets of problems gets solved bitcoins are created.
She understood that explanation.  Now keep in mind I am a web developer and my significant other is a programmer so our house is extremely technology centric and our kids have been on computers since they were 3.  So that may not make any sense to a kid who doesn't even understand what a computes resources are or how it works.
@_date: 2015-02-13 15:42:24
She pretty much got it.  She is both very money savvy and tech savvy though.  She has heard the term prior to this since it is something talked about in my house.  So not a completely unfamiliar concept to her.  
She is very interested now though and came and talked to me about it again last night.  So it's piqued her curiosity. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 23:38:26
I will ask her to get me the exact name of the magazine and issue tomorrow if she can.  She said it was Time magazine but I know it's not the same one you buy on the shelves.
