What am I missing?
That doesn't do anything to decentralize mining. It still could perform a 51% attack. Granted.. I've been out of the bitcoin mining game a long time.

Ads are not the only income revenue for content creators. 
As pointed out, ad blockers. I can't stand using the web without blocking the crap. On some pages, there is so much that it's 5% content, 95% ad.

Please go on, I could use a bit of an explanation.
@_date: 2016-08-13 23:43:21
Not sure what cex.io was, but I can think of a half a dozen pools that had 51% of their respective chain chain off the top of my head. 
When a pool is good, there's no reason to shift. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 23:42:39
What 4 individuals have 51% of the hashing power?
@_date: 2016-08-13 17:08:00
It needs to be centralized around pools.
At this point in the game (and it's been that way for years), without a pool, any small op could wait months to years to hit a block and get paid out.
Anyone can start a pool, and it's decentralized from the people using those pools.

I've never heard of selfish mining. 
Care to explain?

Checking signatures will do *nothing* to prevent this.

No shit, eh?

Have any proof of these? If the entire network isn't aware block 29999 has been found, the entire swarm is still attempting to find the solution to block 29999.
Not sure how anyone would find block 30000. 
In essence, I'm fairly certain this is simply not possible.
@_date: 2014-08-23 02:51:46
No, it was an issue of block sequence.


In this comment, you even mentioned block 300000 can be found before block 299999.
This is impossible. The block will always be solved in order. The times they are solved may be stamped incorrectly, but the blocks **will** be solved in order.
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:42:25
So it's not "selfish" mining. It's simply known vulnerabilities. 
Edit: A letter.
@_date: 2014-08-22 19:12:57
So I had to resort to getting an answer from a dev.
A) It's impossible to solve blocks out of order.
B) It is possible to have the time stamp of the block be incorrect.
So while you are right in discussing the time, I'm correct in the block sequence (of which I was far more concerned about.)
@_date: 2014-12-22 15:05:48
Take action!
We just don't know of what.
@_date: 2014-11-06 01:36:25


This is why some of the alt-coins tried to get a faster retargeting method. IIRC (I've been out of the loop a bit,) one had a retarget at every block. IMHO, bitcoin needs to get on this as well.
@_date: 2014-08-11 20:59:10
And here I was under the impression those bills just got passed along... secretly of course.

Thanks, I changed "watts per hour" to "watt hours."
I'd say it's great for developing countries, but horrible for anywhere with an even remotely solid power grid. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:02:12
That's irrelevant to the fact you still know how much money each address has.
@_date: 2017-02-12 15:38:00
How is it difficult?
You start downloading the chain. You wait. Done. 
If you want it faster, there are partial blockchains you can download. It reduces how much you need to verify.
Also. Verification is disk and CPU intensive. Run it on something faster.
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:41:48
Same as in Wisconsin. There's enough gun shows around here that this happens at as well.

It doesn't matter how the fraud happens! Fake CC, forged signatures, etc. The high fees are not because of fraud. The high fees are because the fucking want to charge you that much. The fraud is passed onto the merchant. 
@_date: 2015-05-18 18:14:56


I can't imagine you are factoring in TCO and ROI.
* The power from the breaker is my basement is delivered to me at a per kWH service. IF ANYTHING breaks, I don't need to touch a damn thing. Power line goes down? Someone else pays for it. The local power company switches from coal to wind, I don't pay for the upgrade. Solar panel breaks? Who's paying for it? The warranty? What happens if it is your fault? Your insurance (increases TCO) or replacement (ROI falls short.)
* Just some quick napkin math, a 50 watt @ 12v solar panel is $100 off amazon. (I'm not electrical engineer) but I *[think]( this equates to 4.1 watts on a 120v line. Even at 20c per kWH (over double what I pay), $100 would buy me 4.1 watt hour for 7.1 YEARS. 
In developing countries, yes, then solar might be the way to go. But if anyone has a decent infrastructure, then not even close.
Edit: Changed watts per hour to watt hours. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:07:40

On eBay? That'll never happen. No one takes the time to go that far out of their way for an eBay auction. By "no one" I mean maybe a very small fraction (Sellers who accept BTC, who are withing driving distance of Buyer.)
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:29:37
Seller: "Look, this &lt;device&gt; works!"
Buyer looks it over, doesn't see any immediate defects. Sends BTC.
Buyer goes home, finds an issue.
Seller: "Buyer could have broken it after picking it up. He confirmed it was acceptable when picking it up in person."
Buyer: "Oh, I didn't use paypal. Can't file a claim to get my money back."
@_date: 2012-11-04 01:12:44
Nothing, that's the whole point. It's to prevent these floods. The TX fee's are also an incentive to mine and solve the blocks. So it's a win-win for everyone.

You have to pay a transaction fee. If you don't, it is the right of the block finder to not accept your transaction. 
@_date: 2012-11-03 00:25:47
No, it doesn't require vigilance. It requires common sense. 
@_date: 2012-11-03 11:43:09
I certainly don't fall into the first, but I get what you mean. Imo: this is the biggest hurdle to mainstream acceptance. It's too easy for your money to just "suddenly disappear" with absolutely no way insurance.

I have 32. But example:
Windows 7 + skyrim = 3gb of memory to be happy. Skyrim takes what.. 6gb of disk space? So in this case, I'd say you would need 10gb of ram or so.
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:36:34


No, you ignored the statement posed by asking a question. Implying you don't see a reason anyone on the planet would need to do this.




Now, for the rest of your rant: 


Two things off the top of my head, consultants and hardware. Paying a consultant monthly? Fees add up in a hurry. I pay one consultant monthly. My bank charges $75/wire internationally. The cheapest I've found is $50, but I'm not switching banks for that.
Buying a large order and want to skip that 2.2% merchant authorization? Plus no charge backs.


But some do.


This is still common of banks, last I knew wells fargo still does this. I'd say they are a large US Bank, no?


But many do care about fees. We can skip the fees by buying from places that accept BTC directly.


[Anyone with an android phone and SMS capable phone.]( That's a large portion of the world.


I'm not sure how this is relevant. However it's the exactly the same as the system put in place now. Only the medium changed.
Bank still issues you funds, there's interest, you pay them back. Why would it be different with crypto? If you take out a loan, run off with the funds, the bank sues you to get it back. 


Why would you think you are not obligated to pay them back?


It's pseduo-anonymous. You can see every transaction made on-chain. 


So is the US Dollar. What's your point?


Stop convincing them to use crypto. Why would you bother? When they want to learn, they'll seek information.

Actually, no. Unless you have given them permission to connect to your network, they have probably broken quite a few laws and you are NOT responsible for what they do. Good luck in courts though.

Yea, I'd run to the hills too. 
"Oh, this guy is selling it half off, if I pay in a service that does not provide the buyer ***ANY*** protection?"
It's a huge red flag. PayPal supports the buyer, not the seller. That's why people love paying in it, and hate accepting it. 
Did you mention escrow? Although that adds another layer of complexity. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 02:22:30
Paypal can, has, and will continue, to freeze accounts with very little reason to do. I would *not* leave any significant amount of money in your paypal account. I'm not sure how bitcoin payments would work with paypal, but I'm sure they want to be in charge of the transactions, and would LOVE to lock you out of your wallet (that they keep the key of.)

As the process matures, it would allow lower prices (the seller doesn't need to factor in chargeback/fraud/processing fees.) Some people can't get credit cards. Some people don't trust the USD?

No.. bitcoin was supposed to (and has) free us from allowing someone to steal and freeze your money. 
YOU choose to still use a middleman. Whether that middleman be an exchange, paypal, bitinstant, etc. YOU just need to find people who are willing to accept BTC for the goods you are looking for.
