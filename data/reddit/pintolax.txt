Bitcoin miners (especially current-gen) convert a more than reasonable amount of input electricity (&gt;80%) into heat. You could possibly recoup your prices depending on your electricity v. natural gas costs and skimp on heating for your house provided you're willing to engineer some solutions. Just putting your miners in your basement will not work if you have any upper levels to your house (and even then, it won't distribute heat well) If you have to pay someone else to redo your heating, you're not going to make ROI.
This (though not exactly current) may provide some other useful info.

As long as the segwit concept isn't better than ANY competing concept on EVERY aspect, it will NEVER get 95 support. Because always &gt; 5% are incapable of making compromises.
Sorry for this inconvenient truth, but thats the rule if human dumbness.
I see a dark future for Bitcoin, because it is stalled forever and cannot evolve beyond the present status on many crucial aspects.
Blockstream's CEO went to china, had a meeting with all of the Chinese miners and promised them Segwit + a 2MB hard fork.
BitcoinCore added Segwit but not the 2MB hard fork that the miners wanted. This is why they are not upgrading.
Many of the miners are signaling 2-8 MB block support. Core is signaling to reduce the blocksize 300kb for no good reason.
There is a disconnect between the software that the miners, users and businesses want and the stuff that Core is outputting. It's that simple.

You shouldn't. Just ignore this posts.

Minimum fee for network propagation is 0.00005 BTC/kB. Right now there is no backlog of transactions, so this fee will go through just fine. For a typical transaction, that's about 1 cent.
Setting a fee of 0 is like winning the lottery to get your transaction in. It's hoping the random miner who's still using an older version of Bitcoin Core never set their MinTxRelayFee parameter.
