I don’t think we will. :) At least not on that scale. i personally don’t think bitcoin will surpass 8k USD for the next year or so, i think the market is calming down. 
BUT! Everything is just speculation, have a great day!
edit: love the downvotes for expressing an opinion different from the norm :)

this person asked a question, which one can only answer with an opinion, i gave my opinion, and i got downvoted. What kind of community doesn’t want to hear and even DOWNVOTES unpopular opinions. Please brush up on your reddiquette everyone, please.

calming down as in less volatile. I want to see bitcoin become stable in value and used as a currency  rather than  it hitting extreme highs and lows

How many transactions can one block hold? 
What about with segwit and without segwit?
