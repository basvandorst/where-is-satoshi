This is important. People forget to give themselves credit for their accomplishments. Even if it is to hold. Instead spend their time being themselves up for their mistakes.

Thanks all, i was worried faith in Litecoin would of sank it during the dip. Now it feels stable and want to triple down. I can buy more of it and it feels like a bigger profit potential.
