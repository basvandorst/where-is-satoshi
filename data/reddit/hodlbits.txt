Bitcoin is the largest trading pair for all crypto currencies.  Everything is paired with it because it is the standard.  Try again,
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:23:25
It’s the first decentralized crypto currency and is the standard in the space.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:17:11
Yes you will 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:27:08
Only for people who don’t see bitcoin as money.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:46:15
If that is Twitter sentiment then it’s fake.  It’s a no brainer to coincide social media attacks with pump and dumps.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:09:53
Yes and it was in a block in 5 minutes.  Why would you send such a high fee?
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:04:23
You’re trying to buy a girlfriend that won’t end well

@_date: 2017-12-13 11:06:20
Don’t forget the cyanide!
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:04:13
People also said in those same threads that we don’t want or need them because they will ruin it.  There is no community consensus on this.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:06:12
BitPay has been shitpay ever since they used their blog to pump bcash 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:57:11
He did say he can’t find his bitcoin.  Would be hilarious if they were in the car.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:59:28
It’s not under heavy load because no one is using it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:26:07
Monero

@_date: 2017-12-17 22:05:36
Leave Hillary alone
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:37:34
It’s centralized and the person running it lies and tries to pass it off as bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:07:32
Then you’re an idiot.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:25:13
You’re a fool
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:41:30
Traders accumulating without driving up the price too fast.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:05:43
 Bitcoins supply is not finite because the supply can be changed by editing the code.
This article is shit.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:52:25
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:05:47
We can’t help you.  Shit, you can’t even help you.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:54:08
These people don’t care about decentralization if they did they wouldn’t be embracing centralized shitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:42:22
Bitcoin didn’t open today because it never closed 
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:40:44
Buys and sells on GDAX do not ever touch the network.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:13:42
So this is just their cartel pumping their crap right?
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:03:40
Go troll somewhere else
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:15:46
Would have been NSA not FBI.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:00:49

@_date: 2017-12-03 13:57:40
No sympathy here.  You should not be having kids if you can’t afford it.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:47:39

@_date: 2017-12-25 09:27:20
God you’re dumb
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:49:05
No.  It’s just not for most people due to the risk.  Bitcoin is already risky.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:53:30
Didn’t Jihan Wu buy BitPay?
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:37:23

@_date: 2017-12-05 11:07:16
Early 20s is the right time to take risks 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:26:57
We aren’t conquering anything with our current TPS
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:07:31
I’m done you’re hopeless 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:04:00
Sure you did.
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:59:05

They are buys and sells on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:17:43
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:45:36
Volume is meaningless when there are zero trading fees
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:22:16

@_date: 2017-11-28 19:45:27
Maybe one of the words is a password?
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:21:00
