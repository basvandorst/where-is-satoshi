This is true, and I thought there would be no reason to have to ask considering scaling was supposed to be such an urgent priority. But since Coinbase seems to be completely disregarding this very important feature, apparently letting them know is required.

In many ways this just speaks to misunderstanding of how engineering in the ecosystem is supposed to work. Instead of using new opt-in tools (Segwit) to improve situation for customers, Coinbase tried to push the engineering costs onto the network (in the form of 2x) and after failing to do so won't do anything.

Should also be added: Coinbase was all about scaling bitcoin with 2x, but can't be bothered to implement Segwit which would actually help long term.

The price is forced into different direction because of different properties they have. Mainly in this world for getting FIAT out. I'd recommend Coinbase for the ease of use and the other stuff (security).

The one sentence BTC sell is something no has found yet. I think the best way is to do it like you did and focus on the fact that it's cool, simple to use and fun tech, more than getting into deep blockchain stuff.

This stuff is fun, but a bit overblown. Sure, the Winklevosses wanted to be first but that didn't happen. That's business sometimes you lose. Coinbase is an awesome company and if their exchange can increase the value of BTC that's a huge win for the WV brothers. Hopefully they can get the ETF done (which would be super important for the BTC community) and hopefully Coinbase does well. The stupid price comments right now pointing to a failure are just stupid. It's about giving the mainstream audience a reliable and safe way of getting to bitcoin, through many avenues, that will increase the price in the long term. Coinbase's exchange is a good step in that direction.
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:09:43
The value of the currency can get "skewed" in a way, since we can't know how many are lost. But also quite accurate estimations eventually can be made. Perhaps to a certain degree even now. The fact that is Bitcoin is divisible to so many decimal places (and I've seen technical papers on even increasing it, though it's not a need even if you dumped the whole world's economic activity into Bitcoin), counters the amount of limited units that can be moved in the system. So it's sort of wrong to think of 21 million units moving around, but more of a technically infinite but also limited amount of units at the same time.
Hope that helps!

That's interesting, though in the case of doing machine-to-machine payments and other crazy apps, I'd assume there'd be an insane amount of transactions that would have to be done. 
Obviously those can't have the high fee. How would those transactions get accomplished?
The way I understand it, for Bitcoin to fully realize its potential, those transactions would somehow have to be done with a digital asset like BTC.

Bitcoin development really isn't that simple, and you can't think of it as just changing one number, and then starting the development.
BTC1 is already like 1800+ commits behind Core (not perfect metric, but gives you the approximate scale of speed), which is a ton of development, and they'll never catch up. Essentially what you'll have is two software projects, one of which is running away at over 10x speed.

@_date: 2017-09-22 22:05:55
Right now unfortunately doesn't look like it, which is a pity considering real time before hardfork would allow implementing a bunch of potentially useful stuff (or at least considering it). 
Considering the "core" version of BTC has, at the very least, quite a bit of support, any HF would seem to result in an ugly split at this time. A pity since everyone could instead focus on actually building out awesome tech and the vision of BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:41:28
I'm just thinking most are incompetent and don't realize that no one is developing Segwit2x branch. It's disturbing to think this implementation could split network.
For me, 2x could be just fine if developers are there, but it makes no sense in a software project to abandon the software.. especially for something as useless as a 2x increase. If you're going to hardfork, actually make some helpful updates.

While I'm typically against this type of kumbaya "let's get along" post, it doesn't make sense to villainize people who disagree with you, and the conspiracy theories generally don't help. It seems harder for people to accept that people just disagree, and there isn't a huge evil network working behind changes. People are just wrong about stuff for various reasons.
Blockchain.info, Coinbase, DCG and others (pick whomever people on this subreddit are attacking) have in their best interests for Bitcoin to succeed. Hopefully the 1st thing a futures market shows that "consensus" is out the window, and BTC2 could jump significantly up and this would still be obviously true. 
With that being said it's time for 2x to die. It's a dumbass idea, implemented in possibly the dumbest way imaginable.

Yeah it's tough. I'm pretty heavily against 2x, but trying to explain that reasonably here. 
2x "succeeding" almost by definition would actually be a good thing, since succeeding would mean attracting the economic majority and an environment that developers would be attracted to (in addition to Bitcoin keeping all of its decentralization). 
That sounds strange, and more importantly obviously won't happen in that manner, so the choices are an ugly split or not doing the fork. An ugly split would likely include a big market cap hit, but also something BTC could very well recover from.. though there's downside risk considering it's a competitive space. 
People are free to do whatever they like, and the market will decide what's best. It creates investor uncertainty for sure, but if Bitcoin is to succeed, this shit has to be survived. 
Personally, the biggest reason I'm not for 2x, is that there's no developer community behind it and hard forking the network (and forcing the entire ecosystem to upgrade) for a measly 2x increase in blocksize is completely pointless if we think about the future of the protocol. We should really hard fork only if there's universal consensus (and for most things considering how public the development has become there won't be). If you look at an upgrade like segwit, and how the [adoption]( cycle has worked thus far, its what makes much more sense for a decentralized ecosystem, with the ability for people to opt-in to new features.
Also, scaling by increasing the blocksize is mostly pointless.  For Bitcoin to reach global adoption, with all the cool use-cases and the like, transaction processing capability will have to be something like 1,000,000TPS. Now, the network can do maybe 5, and doubling the blocksize would get us to 10. With 50mb blocks, you'd still be no closer to the goal, and I don't think anyone thinks Bitcoin can stay decentralized at that size (except for people who really don't get the concept). It's not an intelligent way to scale, actually slows down scaling in some interesting ways, and requires splitting the network in ugly fashion.
Hope those thoughts help a bit.

I think to a point this is true. For many use cases BTC value doesn't need to be very high (though it arguably has to still be a lot higher than today even for these).
But it's only for those use cases, and there are many reasons to think the value should be very high too.
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:15:47
It always has to be profitable, economic incentives are much better at producing a network with great security than not having them. The network can still be huge and secure with a fee based system in a way where transactions are basically free, and that's more of a mining efficiency thing.
The centralization of mining (which you are referring to as a government in this case), is to me often overblown, and the likelihood of a relatively small group of interests actually reaching consensus on the network more of a theoretical discussion than a practical one. It's just that big already today.
The last point I'd make is that the deflationary aspect of BTC isn't as interesting or integral to BTC's success as most people here believe. This is a longer discussion that I won't get into, but whether or not BTC is deflationary, the question is more about the benefit to the consumer in their day-to-day life that will make the difference. Not the monetary system.  
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:58:20
Eventually the majority of the mining reward will go toward fees for transactions. Today those are already implemented, but they make up only a small portion of the mining reward. Those fees should be very small however, if Bitcoin scales to large scale adoption. And by the time fees will start to replace block rewards as the primary source of income for miners, if bitcoin hasn't succeeded, it never will.
So this isn't an issue to be worried about. Basically market could build/sustain a fluid fee structure for different types of transactions that is super cheap. But again, we are a while away from that.

Anyone can edit the code and put in pull requests into the code on GitHub. The foundation just makes sure that there are talented people actually getting paid to work on the code (plus of course promotion and some other stuff).
Yes, central institutions can be stopped, but this is highly unlikely to happen to the BTC foundation and to bitcoin in general, mainly because people are smart enough to understand that this can be great technology.
However, even if you are right and they were "under attack", it would certainly hinder BTC development because fewer smart people are able to spend their time working on the code. But it wouldn't effect the network nor the ability of people to work on the code.
You obviously have a strong opinion of the sort of anarchist nature of bitcoin, and some of those ideas will be true and some false. People had tons of political ideas about what the internet was going to be, and some turned out to be more or less right. The most important thing to note is that more than just working for certain political ideas, hte internet almost uniformly provided value  for most people at most times on earth.
Hopefully bitcoin can do that too.
