You are not just giving to the Ebola cause, which from what I have read sounds to be VERY underfunded at the moment, but you are giving to Doctors without borders which is a pretty fantastic organization that is working on a variety of other health issues and social problems.  
I'm not going to argue that DWB is perfect, but it is probably difficult to find a better organization to give to when it comes to global health issues.

I'm a 34 year old american and can't remember the last time I used a check.  My credit union will send people checks for me if I need, but I don't ever have to directly do it.

All national banks have to be members of the Fed.  When you become a member of the fed you have to give 6% of your capital stock to the fed.  The dividend is compensation for being required to invest into the fed. 
Here are some relevant things to check out. 
"Each state member bank must subscribe to capital stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of its district in an amount equal to six percent of its combined capital and surplus" 
Here is a good article to read to better understand the Fed 
Here is a good paper from the Congressional Research Service about the Fed and how it really works, no tin foil needed

I have read some of Janet Yellen's academic work and have high regard for her as a scholar.

I personal like bitcoin much more for how it makes online buying and selling easier without the need for credit card companies or paypal.  The monetary policy built into bitcoin has all the issues you outlined.  If the Fed made a digital currency that was basically had the same technology as bitcoin but was just a digital version of the USD, i would move to that.

Have Chinese officials ever made any comments about bitcoin? Given how strict the monetary policy of China is I would imagine the government taking a very dim view of the currency.
