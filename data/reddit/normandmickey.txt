I managed to get a Bitcoin node and C-Lightning running on Odroid.  It took two weeks to sync the blockchain though. 
   Hoping to add BTCPay to it soon.

1.  For merchants, familiarize yourself with BTCPayServer (  It has everything they need to accept Bitcoin and Lightning both online and off.  Learn how to use BTCPayServer and charge to either install hardware or get in the middle of a hosted solution for them.  Don't try to do anything custodial,   make sure the merchants understand their keys, their Bitcoin.
2.  As far as wallets for consumers, look into Breez ( technology) for Android or Zap ( for iPhones. 
Again teach people how to use their wallets the right way.  Connected to their own nodes. Breez uses Neutrino and Zap can be connected to personal nodes at home.
