Hey man, the exchanges dont charge you anything for keeping your coins on there. Its just not advised to as they could go down one day or get "hacked" and your coins disappear. Having said that, you could move your coins to a software wallet like electrum to keep them safe from that.
Although bl4ck0r says you "lost" money, you haven't lost anything until you sell your coins. Don't sell them, just hold them in the exchange or in a wallet as the price will most likely go up in the future!

Hey man thats good to hear! The thing is you can buy or sell whenever you want, I am not here to give you investment advice its just if you sell now you actually lose money!
Either way, I understand about the transaction fees. I would say its completely fine to keep it in the exchange until you have enough coinage to justify a transaction (although tx fees right now arent too bad!).

I still see it at 8500...
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:38:23
Could we get a screenshot of the output then?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:07:34
Even if you don't get credited your cash straight away, you lock in the price you are selling your coins at! Lets say arbitrarily the price is at $15,000 and you click sell, and immediately after it drops to $14,000, you will still receive whatever amout you sold at the price of $15,000!

Yup I'm sorry It's late here and I'm an idiot haha thank you for all the information man!

When I first created the wallet I wasn't sure what SegWit was so I opted for a Standard Wallet. If I create a new SegWith Wallet through my Electrum application I would still need to transfer the coins from one wallet to the other right?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:44:32
I use electrum for both! They have separate wallets for both BTC and LTC.

What error are you getting? I haven't been able to verify my passport due to some naming complications and been waiting for their help for a month and a bit now.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:54:59
What does it mean brother man what is this dodling you speak of
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:54:53
Cool thank you for the info!

Hey I have a question. Can I send my non-SegWit coins from Coinbase to a SegWit electrum address or will something mess up?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:34:34
Is it possible that maybe this dip is due to the fact that whales from the CME futures who have been buying a shit load of coins for a month or so during the run up are now selling to double dip and make money from both selling their coins and shorting bitcoin futures?
"But bitcoin futures are cash settled." Yes I get it, but nothing stopped the whales from buying coins when the announcement for futures came about to bloat the price so they could then sell to cause a dip no?
Sure the Coinbase Bcash shit show helped this dip and the insanely bullish month we had needed to come to a screeching halt but this seems to coincide nicely with the CME futures no?

What is dodling? The post you linked got removed.
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:57:38
Does this apply to the seed given by electrum? So if i have my seed I am all good?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:50:39
Thats why you don't day trade on Coinbase. If you absolutely must then make an account on GDAX and do it there as there are low to no fees.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:33:18
Awesome thank you! So if I send it from a non SegWit address to a SegWit address do I get the benefit of choosing lower fees and still having it go through or does it only happen between 2 SegWit wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:57:27
Haha I feel you. Would you happen to know how much smaller a transaction is on SegWit? I read somewhere that an average bitcoin transaction is 226 bytes
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:01:09
Go to gdax and make an account there and transfer your bitcoins from coinbase to gdax (which is free as they are the same company). Then from there send your coins from gdax to your trezor as there are no fees! 
You cant sell directly from your trezor but you could technically sell your trezor with your coins inside?

Cool thank you for the information. Is there anywhere I could maybe check out the fees for SegWit addresses kinda like how bitcoinfees.earn.com works for Standard addresses?
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:58:26
fuck outta here
edit: since its been removed this person was flogging some "investment" website with a shady url which probably had some nasty viruses on it. Stay woke peeps protect your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:56:41
There must be a reason why your post text was removed no?
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:44:05
I honestly don't even know what Ethercoin is and I have never invited or been invited to get bitcoins on Coinbase. Should I quickly move my coins out?
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:29:49
Thank you for your reply. I know what they mean but I would just like to ask if it is necessary to use either multi-sig or two factor if I dont share my laptop with anyone.
Also, how will a segwit wallet differ from a standard one? Some message came up saying that some exchanges aren't compatible with segwit or something and I wouldn't want to lose my bitcoin trying to transfer them one way or the other.
Thanks again for the help!
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:47:04
Does this mean you are essentially given free BTCs or doubling your BTCs? Sorry just started out and I am a little confused about what this all means.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:03:53
Could the new coin technically be worth the same as BTC, essentially doubling what you own in BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:30:28
Thank you for the response!

Hey guys, I created a segwit wallet on Elecrum 3.0.6 and both exchanges I use say that it is an invalid wallet address.
Anyone know why this is the case?? The wallet address starts with a bc1. One of the exchanges I use uses segwit wallets that start with 3 so I thought it would be alright. Any information would be great thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:44:06
Hey man thanks for the info and the site! Looking at it im a little confused though :(
How can you tell that the txs over 5 sats are included in the next block?
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:50:02
Hey guys, how do I check what fees to use and what fees are being confirmed in the next block? 
Looking at bitcoinfees.earn it says 100sats is the best to use but looks expensive when people are saying that 1-10sats are being confirmed. I want my transaction to be quick-ish (in the next hour or so) but also don't want to be over/underpaying.
Thanks in advance guys!
