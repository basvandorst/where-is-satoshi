I'm not going to enter a debate about whether economics is "really" a science.  I think the debate is stupid.  I think "is a science" is not binary; it's a matter of degree.
But by your logic: climate science is not empirically grounded, I guess?  Not a science?  Astronomy, also not a science, not empirically grounded?

So?  Therefore monetary stimulus doesn't work?  Not to be rude, but if that's your conclusion, what you have is an ideological, unempirical, and unscientific understanding of macroeconomics.  It is not that simple.  Facts about how the economy works cannot be simply reasoned out of first principles in a fact-less vacuum with no empirical testing, any more so than they can be be about any other natural phenomenon.
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:17:22
It kind of does.  I disagree with the premise of your question.
As to why I like Bitcoin?  Well, for some of the same reasons that are listed in the sidebar:


Although monetary stimulus can work, and can be a valuable tool for managing an economy, I think it is valuable and useful for society as a whole to have currencies that are outside of the control of banks and governments.
Now I'm a bit confused.  Do you think that believing that stimulus can work is incompatible with supporting a digital currency?

I did not do it to be rude.  That's what I said, and it's true. 


A lot of economics is scientific.  A lot is not.  There are economists who have an ideological, unempirical, and unscientific understanding of economics.  There are those who don't, and instead have an understanding of economics that is empirically grounded.  Krugman is one of them.


No it's not.
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:42:41
So you disagree with the author of the article as well?
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:43:36
1) Agreed.  However, that the quote you pulled from my comment does conflict with this passage of the author's:


2) It is not "simply" robbing Peter to pay Paul.  That betrays an unnuanced understanding of macroeconomics.
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:33:14
A fair question.  Briefly, I like Bitcoin for other reasons.  I wouldn't say it precludes monetary stimulus anyway; I would say that it weakens it, the extent to which it replaces national currencies, but that's it.
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:34:10
I agree.  Certainly one of his weaker pieces.

I don't think it follows.  I think it *can* help the economy.  Doesn't mean it's always used that way.  I agree that it is similar to taxation: taxes can be used for the greater good.  Doesn't mean they always are.
I would be in favor of a different kind of monetary stimulus in the face of the housing crisis: giving enough money to families with underwater mortgages to afford their mortgages, or forcing re-financing of these mortgages under current home values.  That would have the macroeconomic effect of helping the economy, which I believe exists, without simply handing value to the already rich and powerful.  I think having competing currencies to national currencies can help reduce those forces.  That's why I'm in favor.  However, I'm not in favor because i don't think monetary stimulus can work.  Because it really, really can.

I don't think we disagree.  I think you conceded the point, that duplicate Earths or Universes are not required to make something that studies the Earth or the Universe a science.  Note that I did not claim that economics was in "the same league" as climate science or astronomy, and, frankly, that's irrelevant to my point.  As is the "oh, that's just a theory" folks.  What do I have to do with them?  Nothing.
Anyway, what I wrote before was:


So you say things like:


Don't you think that maybe we agree?
To then conclude there aren't economists who are making these arguments, trying to shout down those economists who blather for money, is to help the charlatans.
Just my opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:25:33


Which...I didn't say?  So...that's also irrelevant?  You have a strange habit for dressing up irrelevant statements as a response.  I'm sorry, I can't really take you seriously anymore.
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:42:40
You did concede a point.  You conceded this point:


You did not concede all possible points, sure, including that other point that you said you did not concede.  
As I said, I can't really take you seriously.  You should be more careful with your reading.
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:08:19
If that was *not* your conclusion, then I wasn't insulting you, was I? 


So why did you bring that up, then?  What are you talking about? 
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:55:37
Thanks, those are good.
I don't know, I don't think I *like* stimulus *per se* either.  I think that the government can provide stimulus at certain times in the business cycle that can help get through depressions quicker.  That does *not* mean I think the gov't should be always growing.
In other words: Like Krugman, I'm against those who say the correct response to every economic event is to shrink government, but that doesn't mean that I think the correct response to every economic event is to grow government.  I think it is a more subtle issue: *sometimes* the right response is to grow government.  Sometimes, shrink it.
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:48:05
I know.  So? 
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:56:31
That's not a parallel construction to what I said.  A parallel construction would be:


@_date: 2013-12-31 18:02:53
Good example.
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:17:06
I am a fan of both Krugman and Bitcoin.  I think Krugman is wrong about Bitcoin.  But this article is silly.


That is silly economics.  This person does not know what they are talking about.  There is a lot of evidence that fiscal stimulus and monetary stimulus work.
So, I wonder what the affiliation of this guy is?  Oh:


@_date: 2013-12-30 18:48:27
I know, right?  Is there a real response to Krugman's article?  Because I would like to read it. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:21:43
I added this:


@_date: 2013-12-30 20:10:04


What?  I didn't assert that.


What are you talking about?


What *is* the topic?  Because I can't tell.
