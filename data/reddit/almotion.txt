What will you be able to buy with one bitcoin when it does? Like as in, what will it be valued at? It needs to be pegged to one fiat or another otherwise it won’t have any value

Agreed. But said note could still be found and confiscated don’t you think?
Not only would it be confiscated, but your bitcoin could also be transferred out/stolen
That’s what this whole topic is about, so thanks for agreeing with my original point.

Unless you store it on an exchange (tut, tut) or  memorise your private key or seed, i'm pretty sure they can confiscate it from you too
@_date: 2018-11-08 16:47:53
Still. If it’s tangible, it can be confiscated.

It’s not as easy as you’d think for a Venezuelan who doesn’t speak a word of English.

24 English words will stick out like a sore thumb in a Spanish essay.

Don't forget it's used for fee reduction (like the binance coin). It's used as collateral for the credit line that's coming out soon. Also, it's used for staking that can earn you a load of money and better perks for your metal card.

Pig farming is huge. But not as bullish as beef

And that’s what makes gold so difficult and expensive to send it to someone on the other side of the world
