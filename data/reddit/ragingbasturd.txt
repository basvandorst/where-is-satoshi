I think you mean to ask do you regret buying at the peak. 
Answer would still be no if I did. But I didn’t.

Makes no sense 
@_date: 2018-09-16 07:54:16
Yea this is not a good idea. I wouldn’t push for this. 
I’m coming from a general awareness campaign point of view 
@_date: 2018-08-26 12:32:40

Anyone can be a lone nut. Takes real courage for a single person to start following that nut.

Keeping something and doing nothing with it is not using it. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 05:28:54
Owning bitcoin does not protect me from inflation. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 00:20:53
No this year. Or next. Or next or next.  Maybe next year after that 
@_date: 2018-07-08 04:53:23
So how has bitcoin protected me from inflation in the last 6 months? 
@_date: 2018-07-06 17:53:30
Much more 
@_date: 2018-07-08 15:15:25
We’re not at that stage yet. We need people to use it. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 05:27:09
That’s a different question. 
My point here is that I buy bitcoin to actually use it. Not keep it. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 19:01:49
How has it?
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:38:17
That’s keeping it. Not using it. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 17:56:03
I buy bitcoin to use it.. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 19:30:25
Wtf you have no idea what you’re talking about.... I’ll stop here since this is your reply. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 05:30:16
Why are you people so dense?** 
That’s not using it. That’s keeping it. My bikes in the fucking shed. I’m not using it. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 01:36:00
Owning it and keeping it is not using it. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 05:48:26
That’s not the point. 
Storing something is not using it. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 13:02:04
It hasn’t has it. 
Anyway that’s off topic. Keeping it is not using it.
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:38:21

Laugh at him if you will but this is actually the perfect marketing strategy that anyone can do and will be in circulation for a few years 
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:01:55
Eh... NO
