Sure but I meant as utility, it's unreliable and bad tech-wise compared to a modern car for the same price.
Or it's because it's limited edition or whatever and it becomes a speculative asset.

Bitcoin is going to crash soon, tx fees kill it right now.
The team is unreliable and not trust-worthy.
Banks will make Bitcoin illegal.
BCH will beat BTC.
Bitcoin has scaling issues.
Bitcoin has tx fees issues.
We need to improve Lightning Network to overcome the fees of $xx we have today.
We need to achieve the same fees as BCH with Lightning of another Layer solution asap.
Do you see the difference between these?
I hope so and that's why I see no problem with his comment.

We can hate regulations as much as we want but it would have been so useful earlier considering Bitfinex rn.
Good thing.

Agreed, I was about to write it but figured the topic was more about speculative asset vs innovative currency.

Fear uncertainty and doubt is FUD. That was just a fact, no lie, no hyperbole, if you consider any negative fact as FUD that doesn't belong on a sub dedicated to improving it's just censorship.

Imo the chart tells dead cat's bounce son bulltrap but i have quite the same perspective, not worried.
But i think we have to consider the timeline and how mainstream it got: people will talk about it at Christmas and we may feel it in the next few days/weeks.

He probably just checked the order book which is really bad to calculate anything.

Indeed but that's not the topic, I meant it wasn't something making him untrustworthy.

Especially since Ver is a felon for illegally selling fireworks.

Bitcoin is an invention but it can't be used as intended for now. If the issues for everyday use are fixed, maybe. For now it's as speculative as stocks.
Also you wouldn't buy a car from 1980 at the original price (even with 0 miles) right now, things need to improve. The tech gets more valuable or stable over time, not the goods.

Well I call my defeat and say my analogy was bad but you see where I was going?

2 audits from 2 different, untied companies.

If you're into Porsche, the Panamera (especially the executive) project was directed by a really tall guy, that's why I have no doubt you'd fit in there while getting a great car. It was one of his priorities since he couldn't fit in a 911.
But not a lambo.
