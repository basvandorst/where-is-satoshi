As a poor venezuelan public college student, I second this idea.

I'm a student and I live in Venezuela. I protest. I'd like to know, in simple steps how are you going to distribute the money; so bitcoin is adopted among the people? PR? Also, background. Could you give me examples of how bitcoin has ever helped in other third world country, when in crisis? Thank you, for taking the initiative.
Everyone here should understand that we venezuelans, are in a huge shithole when it comes to economy.  I believe we need to begin "teaching men how to fish" instead of keep giving the fish itself. 
I'm no expert but I think some sort of foundation (NGO) to educate people on how does mining work, and using the money to give people the actual tools to mine (minig rigs?) would help A LOT of people, especially when currency control is on the table. With, of course, a transparent truly-willing-to-help head of the organization; we don't need more *vivos* (people that doesn't care how much of an asshole they need to be, how many laws need to be broken to get what they want at the expense of someone else, someone naive, *un pendejo*; to get goods of any kind, usually money). We need people that want to step up and help your country, not to trade bitcoins for amazon gift cards to buy iPhones that you're going to get robbed anyways. If the *malandro* (common thug) doesn't kill you before.

Venezuelan here. **It's absurd**, yes, but definitely **not because of the reason that you are pointing out**. Our government is pretty incompetent, they don't "track" anything, really (the exception being if that thing is useful to "validate" some point of their discourse and stay in charge of the *oil money*).
The first thing (and the only, I think) that you need to take into account is the fact that the service is "subsidized", but **REALLY shitty**. Not only you wouldn't mine efficiently, because of power shortages, but you could loose everything, even with surge protectors. I have lost two HDDs already because of them.
That is if you killed somebody for the money to get the rig in the first place.

Thanks for the recommendation. I haven't, is just that I had to replace some pieces in it. Magnets (bitch!) the most, near the HSA of the disk. 
On top of that I don't think is worth it to have that many people look into it (if or when I can get out of here, after all is nice to dream, even if you don't have jack shit. I mean the president of the MIT [is Venezuelan]( because there was no super big amount of bitcoin to fund that kind of enterprise, back then I only had a Pentium 4, that was it. No graphics card then, no graphics card today, luckily I have now and i3, is just too late to start mining again. So by today standards it must be like 2-5$, maybe?

I'll try to sum up all of the history that unravels around the curse that can become having oil as a country.
We were, primarily, an agricultural country, and because of our location relative to the caribbean, a great harbor for commercial transaction (and all the potential for tourism that never have been exploited correctly. I mean, we have the caribbean, the andes, the amazonic jungle, [tepuyes]( [the angel falls]( desert dunes, [Los Llanos](
In the mid-fifties, was the oil-boom. Then everyone (that knew what the hell oil is, and how to take advantage of it) was rich, the thing is we were as every other banana republic on dictatorship, a right wing one, so they didn't care too much about social issues.
When democracy finally came, economy was strong but we were pretty ignorant about a lot of shit, most people didn't know how to read. So a little bit of people struggle for the power, some were good presidents, some were bad. Fast forward to the seventies, all venezuelans were in Miami, FL buying everything, two of each one. Everything was incredibly cheap. Meanwhile, here some more bad economic decisions. No one here produce something the world would want, no innovations, no profit; boom we're on debt. More economic decisions, boom Chávez came to the power.
He was a bad administrator, A LOT of economic bad decisions, and to try to amend the he made worse ones like CADIVI (the currency exchange controls) , but also some Social incredibly good ones, he had some nice social ideas, but he wasn't a man for handling money. More debt. He dies (because that's the only way he'd left the power after almost two decades. He wasn't strictly a dictator. A shitton of people loved him. His discourse was extremely demagogic, hence the love). 
His heir Maduro [wins]( so more mob oratory, buying love/votes with oil money, more ruin, less production, looting, etc.
**TL;DR**: government abuses.
Also, too many problems with the electrical system. No, I don't think bitcoin would be well-implemented. Venezuela is not ready, not just yet.

Pretty common.
Smartphones? Not so common. One day you got one, one day you don't (or risk "getting away" with both the phone and a bullet).

I'm okay with this.
Thank you.

Yes. There are three carriers, but no SMS service for bitcoin. It would be incredibly expensive.
To put it in perspective: I'm a public college student. [This cellphone]( is my daily driver, I spend about 40 bolivares (VEF) per month on it. 1 BTC to VEF should be about 43500 bolivares. So what I spend monthly on my prepaid plan (not really; most of the time there's no money for luxuries such as paying "monthly" for something other than food) would get me about 0.001 BTC. Just for savings? I would do it. Other non-tech-savvy people? No way. People barely understand how to get dollars here, you would need a hell of a campaign of education, which would be pretty much impossible to do here.

6.30, not 11.30. And 3K top, not 5K. Yes, it is fucking nearly impossible as a regular person (college student here). 
I myself was an early bitcoin lover, I mined some bitcoin in 2010. Lost it, hard drive dead. I repaired it (you need to repair your shit here, buying new stuff can mean not eating in some cases. That's because everything we use is imported. So or it's extremely expensive or there is no product to sell. Google "Venezuela's toilet paper shortage".), but everything was gone. It was so frustrating when I heard that 1 bitcoin was equal to 1000 $. I got sick. I mean, with that quantity of dollars you can survive, and even buy nice extra things. Also just having dollars means you profit, as the value of the bolivar goes to the crapper. So yeah. :'(

It can be [worse.](
