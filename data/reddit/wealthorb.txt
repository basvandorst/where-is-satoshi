Because they don’t have a brighter future. 
Bitcoin is making sure to take better, more conservative long-term steps and I suspect it’s way more likely to be in greater use 10 years from now than any altcoin.

Follow up: it looks like one of the most promising alts. I’d consider diversifying a little if I feel motivated to go through the hassle of purchasing it.
But I still will personally place my bets on bitcoin. How I see it is that it is natural that the largest, best quality developer community will coalesce around the oldest stable crypto (and most cutting-edge in terms of protocol development). 
The “conservative steps” is not any organization making decisions but is the outcome of the dynamic consensus process between the open source process and all players in the bitcoin ecosystem. This is the process that I’m betting will come out on top, or at least in the center, of the cryptosphere.
Not to say that bitcoin is the best in every objective measure. Ada looks like it’s really well thought out and on top of the technology. Maybe they’re doing certain things better than bitcoin. Still, I’m a believer in robust decentralized systems, and think bitcoin is a better current example of that (has demonstrated robustness at far bigger scales over years, compared to alts).
My analogy is that the entire crypto ecosystem is like one big open source software project with many many teams. Bitcoin would be your fully committed, stable, current best working version.
If open source teams working on alts like ada make protocol advances then I don’t see why those improvements couldn’t also just be incorporated into bitcoin.
Honestly I think we still have a ways to go to see how exactly different cryptos will coexist in a mature crypto ecosystem. I don’t necessarily expect all the value to flow into the “winner”. 
I do think that smart contract functionality is worth a lot, and bitcoin is currently missing out on some market share (in fact I expect bitcoin’s market share to decline for the foreseeable future as alts multiply, even as its price may continue to rise), but as far as I know work is proceeding to bring all of these nice layers of added functionality to bitcoin.
I’m in it for the long haul, and I think we are still ten years away from seeing the mature form of blockchain technology.

I think it’s a pretty basic principle of investing that there is a trade off between risk and expected returns.
Nobody would invest in higher-risk assets if their expected return were not also higher. This applies generally, not just to crypto.
I agree with Fisher that you seem to be missing the meaning of what they said.

I feel like as long as the waste heat is captured and used there’s no downside really, right? Then it’s just offsetting energy used for heating, but also producing bitcoins as a side effect.
Am I missing something?
