I did a WF transfer on local bitcoins and it was sketch as fuck, but only because the bank asked so many questions when I initiated the transaction. "Who is this person you are sending money to?" etc...
The fear and suspicion inside banks is palpable. Do anything even remotely suspicious and expect an SAR with your name on it.

Would the creator of bitcoin actually give a fuck if it was German made? I like to think Satoshi would be far beyond nationalism.

How does one invest in Ethereum? Or have they even started taking capital from investors?

Money laundering, like drug crimes, are not crimes in and of themselves. The argument for drug prohibition is that drug dependence leads to crimes involving victims. So by stopping drug use, you in effect are stopping the subsequent crime that comes with it. Money laundering is a tool for facilitating crime, not a crime itself,  and if we apply this same faulty logic to all means of facilitating crimes, our prohibitions would be endless.
So lets just make cars illegal, and cellphones, GUNS, credit cards, cash, and anything else that allows ease for criminal activity. Because as long as we do it in the name of reducing crime, the public will buy it.

People who boast about how nice they are usually aren't. It's great to give money away, but bragging about it is counter intuitive.
