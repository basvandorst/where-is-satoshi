Remarkable and ground- breaking.

Appreciate. I'm in it for the long game. Salute!

This guy is a useful idiot. He and his friends/ clients should keep buying shiny rocks. That should keep them busy while I buy more bitcoin.

And close the thread. It’s as simple as that for honorable people.

Can’t wait till these fraudsters are fully exposed. They and coinbase are confusing the hell out of the noobs.

Yes, payout at 2018 rate not 2013. That would be proper, but not procedure. This is a  massive financial crime by a government.

I saw similar numbers. Gdax/coinbase must be doing it again. Really screwed a lot of people back in Dec.

Its not a good investment long term. B-cash will die along with many other alt coins when the lightning network is proven and battle tested. Really soon.

This is correct. This is a huge fraud. Who the f would want $400/btc when you’re owed its value now? Imagine if that was done(at this level) with stocks, it would be deemed the biggest fraud in history.

What’s going on with the b-cash pump? I haven’t heard anybody talk about it. It’s up 20% while most other alts are down. Does anybody have insight on this? Seems very suspicious.

Investment. BCH’s 21 billion MC should be flowing into BTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:37:36
I sure hope so. It’s def cutting into our market share right now.

Giancarlo and Clayton, although fairly ignorant of the tech themselves, both did a good job under pressure from these morons with power. I find it entertaining to watch these ignorant dinosaur senators flail about. Most of them are completely clueless but just can't stop themselves from grandstanding and running their f***ing pie-holes. I heard almost zero understanding of any technology from these half-wits. All I heard was pitiful know-it-alls and control freaks asking irrelevant questions. The world will be much better when they're extinct. They are why we need Bitcoin. These fools have been f***ing up the world for far too long. Only a huge a**hole would ever want to be a politician in the first place, and only a super black-hole sized a**hole would ever rise to the level of senator in their fraudulent so-called profession. Disgraceful on so many levels, and irrelevant. They're finished and don't yet know it.

“I’m a paid shill” almost mad me spit out my coffee. Well done.
