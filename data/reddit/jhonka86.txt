Good to know...  I'll have to keep that in mind.  Thanks!

What about those people who have invested in bitcoin, continue to hold bitcoin, yet still think that this current 3x increase in 1 month is a bubble?

I also haven't noticed anything in my account.  I think I put it in correctly? O_o

Dammit, I go play video games for an hour and I miss out on all the fun :-/

I cannot upvote you enough.  I posted something similar yesterday and got so many flames :-P

has been an echo chamber a lot in the past.  When you see a sudden, large rise in price, this is especially true.
Bitcoin has the potential to take off, possibly into the stratosphere.  But it also has the potential to become absolutely worthless.  Gauge your investment carefully; you wouldn't be the first person to go bankrupt from Bitcoin.

Yeah.  I'm sitting here on my coins that have recently increased by 2.5x, and I'm starting to wonder if it's the bear or the bull :-P

According to this, it looks pretty bull trappy to me.

During the last bubble, some people put a significant amount of their savings into bitcoin, and some people took out loans to buy more.  Since bitcoin is not a unit of account (yet), when their $10,000 turned into $3,000, and they had rent or loan payment due, times were tight.
If they managed to hold on until now, their gamble would have paid off big time.  But that wasn't possible for everyone.

Update: I sent a small amount there and back, and it was both deposited and extracted safely.  But with all the warning flags from everywhere, I'm still skeptical.

Posting again because I think I got missed.  :-P

The green line tracks the time and price of a sale.  The higher vertically, the longer ago it was.  The more to the right, the higher the price, and vice versa for the left.
So, basically, it was just running all over the place yesterday.

Thanks!  I also ran into  which may or may not be useful to other windows users.

I wasn't really interested in day trading.  I was just wondering where I could go to set up buy / sell orders instead of being at the whims of Coinbase.
I was thinking about BTC-E, as they generally have the lowest cost for BTC and also trade in altcoin, but I honestly couldn't figure out how to get them my money.  That is, besides using bitinstant to buy bitcoin, wiring bitcoin to BTC-E, and then selling bitcoin for USD.

Isn't that what mcxNow did, which turned out to be a scam? Or am I missing something here?
Honestly, I'm not sure why they would be paying interest on these coins; it's not like you having coins in your account on Vircurex does anything for them if they're not being traded.

This is an excellent idea. I started setting up spreadsheets to do this by-hand earlier, but this sort of program will be much easier.
If I only knew how to use any of the files provided :-P

Are there any good / reputable investment options right now similar to just-dice?  And that being said, how legitimate is just-dice? :-P
Not sure if this counts as a moronic question, but it's something I'd like the community's input on. Thanks!
