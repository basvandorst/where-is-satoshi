And Citigroup has $1.67 TRILLION in liabilities too.  Losing $400 million is more like someone with a  $50,000 net worth losing $100.  Not critical, but enough to ruin your day.

This is pathetic and really casts the bitcoin community in bad light.  This isn't a cult.

 would be impossible to enforce.

Not that I agree with that troll, but this is relevant:

And most of what most people do on their computers is online. Facebook, Google, YouTube, Amazon, twitter, reddit all run Linux.

Nodes will not relay double spends so you would need an army of maliciously modified nodes to pull this off.  It is not impossible, but it is expensive and difficult.  That is why people say accepting zero conf transactions is an acceptable risk for low value items.
It isn't perfect, but it is actually really good. Cash can be counterfeit, checks can bounce, credit cards can get charged back, etc... Yet businesses can operate with all of these small risks.  The risk of a successful double spend for an in person transaction where the actual cost to the merchant is less than a couple hundred bucks is low.  
Payment processors like bitpay and coinbase , green addresses (are those still being talked about?), and off chain transactions all can help too.

It also works in the browser on your computer if you have a webcam.

These cult-like posts really need to stop.   This isn't a religion.  You sound like this guy:

This analysis is not based on address balances.

Edit: not related to actual entry of the key.
If you really want the most security, you wouldn't want to enter the private key on a hot computer. Instead the transaction can be templated from the public key on the hot computer, and signed with an imported private key on the cold computer.  Unfortunately I don't know of any use friendly tools to do this. You can do it with the raw transactions api, though.

Some interesting estimating here:

I haven't heard anyone from the ethereum team talk about taking down Bitcoin. That's just the sensational headline.

Calling it vaporware when the project is just a couple months old and actual code is being publicly developed on github is a bit harsh.

This isn't based on address balances, so no worries:

This isn't based on addressess:

These estimates come from rpietila's thread on bitcointalk: 
He does *not* use Blockchain analysis for the obvious reasons you mentioned.

Maybe, just maybe, the are running a legit operation and don't want sell Bitcoins that they don't have and can't get.

iTunes... Isn't that the centralized marketplace that is owned by one of the largest companies in the world?  Sort of the opposite of Bitcoin.

Physical bitcoins are inherently a novelty.  There is no way they can be exchanged except by sacrificing the security of an actual bitcoin transaction.  Any physical bitcoin product must be design to enhance its  novelty factor because otherwise it is useless.
