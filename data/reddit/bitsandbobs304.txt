you say that investing in companies is guided by performance, which guides emotions, and yet fb,yt,twitter etc. etc. have all been always and exclusively been operating at a loss and no one knows if they'll ever turn a profit, yet this hasn't stopped investors from pouring tons of money in them

advertising pays nickels.  
servers cost dollars.
development, marketing, moderating, customer care, lawyers, etc cost untold millions.
unless you believe that the government funds fb and google to monitor citizens, there's no way they're operating at profit from advertising. everyone is terrified of target advertising from fb but if you make yourself a company page and go to the page where you buy ads you'll see you can barely target demeographics at all for your campaign, and their cheap cheap price reflects that

bitcoin is only partially anonymous.   
it is not a private cryptocurrency, therefore unfit for criminal activity (this does't mean that there aren't other cryptos that are more fit for the job)  (it also doesn't mean that there aren't terrorists using bitcoin, but they are not the smarter ones..)

Is it truly anonymous? No id and no cameras?
