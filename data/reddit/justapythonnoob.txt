    Hi ****, Thank for contacting us.
 
    Sorry for not responding to you earlier, we've missed your last email.
 
    You are right, the payment was market as having been paid out but had not been. It was tagged as having been paid from one of our personal bank account. To make sure bill who are late get paid as fast as possible we sometime do this. What I think happened was that the payee "*****************" was not available at any of our banks and we forgot to change the status so it get paid by our payment processor.
    It will be in this weekend's batch and will be paid Monday.
 
    Sorry for the inconvenient.

    I’ve sent multiple emails regarding this issue to support and info and have yet to receive a reply. Is Bylls.com still in business? Can you update me on the attached transaction and let me know if you plan on honoring it?

    Can you update me on the following transaction please. It was made on October **** and there is still no record of ***************** receiving this payment for my account( If you need the blockchain transaction summary, let me know and I will forward it. Also, is there a number where I can call directly for assistance? I do not see this on your website.

Sounds good in theory but Quadriga is such a shit show atm that you could be waiting 2 months plus to withdraw a substantial amount of fiat.

Bylls.com  is shady. Took a payment from me, never paid the bill then never sent back the coins while admitting they were at fault.

I believe I made the payment in Aug. of last year.
