How did old west pioneers confirm their money?
They bit coin.

Sadly, Tails' portability (and primarily amnesiac) operating model presents a challenge for running any kind of service at all. Having an electrum service know your addresses isn't great, but it's not a deal breaker for many OPSEC threat models, especially when the parties are using mixers and nothing about the wallet or transactions links to their real identity. Absolute security and privacy would be better, but those aren't exactly possible even in stock bitcoin yet.
As for running a separate server (for any service at all, really), there isn't much of an issue if it's bought using clean or tumbled bitcoins and if the VPS is trustworthy. I use a BNC over a VPS (for example) when on Tails. But just as some peoples' threat model would not allow giving their bitcoin addresses out to just one trusted Electrum node, others may not agree with sending bitcoin and trusting a VPS not to be used to connect the dots to deanonymize them.
I think Electrum is serving its purpose and you should only connect to the Electrum nodes you trust, which is essentially what you're describing.
edit: if any Tails users are worried about this and truly want to run their own node, I recommend running QubesOS/Whonix instead of Tails. It's a little less user friendly (prepare yourself to learn Linux!) but it's infinately more powerful and its operation model make it much more secure unless you purposely break it.

Qubes is fine for running services and is quite stable for me and everyone in  and Have you had some issues with it for your particular machine that you weren't able to resolve? It does take lots of memory to run..
@_date: 2016-03-16 00:09:52
For those of us who can't use Youtube, what was the TL;DR? Was it security based or political (potentially both)? Tails OS comes stock with Electrum wallet and running Bitcoin core isn't going to be possible for many of us.

Assuming it did work for that purpose (which I also have doubts about), I wouldn't care what ASIC miners think. Bitcoin's security depends on decentralization of mining also. Having a single source effectively controlling the distribution of new coins is basically enabling a digital FED.

That's precisely why they buy gold. Bitcoin may eventually outperform gold, but there are limits to what a digital currency can achieve in a physical world, and rational actors do not look to replace every monetary medium with a single-point-of-failure anyway.
Don't argue that gold is worthless, just keep arguing that bitcoin might outperform it. Anything else makes you sound like a lunatic.

This is all too common and tends to be due to people being stuck in a perpetual activist mode. It's great to want to promote bitcoin, but think of bitcoin like a gun that the status quo can't take away from you easily. Why would anyone want a sticker of that on their car bumper?
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:24:01
And Bitcoin can't be spent outside of a digital network without some counterparty risk. It is also cumbersome and difficult to secure digitally.

It's a sort of IPO (ICO) where they sell shares in their company as their own coin, and exchange it for bitcoin (which sets the price of the coins), so that the girls get some bitcoin based on their performance/popularity. It's an interesting concept for an entertainment medium.
Here's the explanation from the coin exchange site:


















I admit I don't understand it completely. Maybe someone else can take a look.

Renouncing doesn't help. The US is the bully who respects no limits and adores power.

You cannot trust PIA. You cannot trust *any* VPN, but you can "not trust" some VPNs more than others. Look for a VPN with a specific freedom focus who is not afraid of audits and loves challenging laws. VPNs who make blanket "no log" statements without explaining that it's actually impossible to do so are usually dangerously reckless.
I recommend Bitmask (which is the replacement for Riseup's old VPN servers). They are on US soil, but designed and maintained by freedom loving non-profit organization who would rather go to prison than share logs.

You should be proud of bitcoin's *immutable* ledger, but don't be too proud -- that makes you lazy and will lead a new generation of lazy bitcoiners to not recognize when it stops being immutable. Vigilance is critical.
@_date: 2016-05-08 06:24:49
It's not politicians that are dangerous, they just draft self serving rules and steal tax dollars while taking vacations. It's the judges, the ones who are *appointed*, not voted in, to interpret laws in ways that go against your freedoms that you have to worry about.

I'm a QubesOS user, so take this seriously. Qubes uses Xen hypervisor which say on a vulnerability for 7 years that allowed leaking into other VMs and gaining root on the dom0. Do not assume QubesOS (the beta OS written on the flawed principle of VMs = secure) is magically secure, because it's not. I still use it as a hobby and hope for its eventual auditing and proper VM security improvements though. Stay vigilant!

SHA2 is a hashing algorithm. SSL is what they'd see, and you're right. It's all deception and smoke screens all the way down.

Bitcoin's foundation is its code. Anything else is exactly what it was built to subvert.

It's not the encryption they're on about, it's the "trying to hide your real location" bit, which in legal theory stands, but in reality is just as impossible as encryption to ban.

Yea, the article left out the actual proof.


This applies to proxies and VPNs of all types, not just Tor.

There really should be an outlined "line" to cross, because people said that right up to and even during every war, kidnapping, mass murder, etc in history. There are entire religions that preach that the last resort is to let someone kill you rather than be violent yourself, so what peaceful alternatives do you suggest? Waiting 60 years until your ability to fight back is diminished and the next young generation repeats the same hippie nonsense about "alternatives"? 
@_date: 2016-05-08 07:56:13
That's called legal theory and is not the reality. The reality is that judges rubber stamp things instead of reading them and weighing them with our rights in mind, issue no-knock raids to innocent people's houses that get people killed, and look the other way on police officers stopping individuals for the crime of being black.
So no, the article is properly alarming us of the logical progression of having corrupt officials get their way.
@_date: 2016-05-08 08:13:24
We are upset. Bitcoin was invented to remove the funding from their wars and agendas, to shank the rug out from under their taxation with full misrepresentation. They're not going down without a fight though.

We do vote, but voting only works when less than half of the population wouldn't vote in a random pop or movie star just because they think they "know them" from their performances.
And then it only works when there isn't purchased media influence for whomever the elite want in, completely ignoring all other candidates (remember Ron Paul?).
And then it only works when the electoral college says it works, because if you don't vote the *corrupt* party, they don't count your vote.
It's scams and deception all the way down and you know it.

HTTPS doesn't "reroute" anything geographically in an attempt to conceal its location, but without that last clause, anything connecting over TCP/IP itself would qualify.

Governments represent, fund and protect the banks. In my poorly worded statement, *banks* were the government. Without being able to steal money from us, they can't pay for their crimes.
@_date: 2016-05-08 11:24:04
The title of that article is misleading. Tor wasn't designed to spy on its users, it was designed to protect spies, which it currently does at the expense of civilians.
@_date: 2016-05-08 11:32:05
Who runs the VPN? To be honest, there are always going to be attack vectors, that's why people like MaidSafe are working on an entirely new internet that theoretically won't have these problems by design. That is what the problem is at its root, TCP/IP was designed to give away all information along its path as a necessity to function properly. All Tor or VPNs do is add some obscuring layers to it, which security professionals and programmers alike agree is no final solution. 
In the interim, use a VPN hosted by people who aren't bending over to the government, like Riseup / BitMask.
