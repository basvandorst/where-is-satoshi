The problem banks are having is eventually as this market matures there will be ROI larger then .05% such as banks are offering. With proof of stake and services where you can lend your crypto for 14% per annum the market is shifting and tides turning.

They have no support structure similar to how FB operates. It's a shame we put so much faith and trust in these systems and they act with impunity toward the very people that provide them with their profit and business model.

60% of the people in this space are not going to use banks as their custodial of their btc or any other crypto for that matter

That was fun to watch but we are not getting to 16 in October.  Would be ok for me to be wrong but i am doubtful

Exactly my point. Gold is not risky and has been used as a hedge for a vey long time and has a huge trust factor. With the volatility of btc I do not see it as a suitable replacement for gold. At least not now

during recessionary times I do not think that money moves from a risky market to a more risky.. People tend to hang on and play the conservative game.
