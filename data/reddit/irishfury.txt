Rather discuss private with interested parties.

I was debating this but I'd rather go the community first.

Been waiting for some good bitcoin affiliate programs.  Or sell my site got over 15,000 users and never monetized it.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:28:34
When will these companies start a bitcoin affiliate program :)
@_date: 2012-09-13 01:21:33
You can buy almost anything right now on the internet with a bit coin. 
@_date: 2012-09-13 03:29:38
This is along the lines I was thinking.  My friend was on bitcoin rampage today ask random people if they knew.  Asked about ten people not one person knew what they where.

Congrats I got started in online marketing because of adult websites.  Back in 1998 I ran some of the larger sites on the net.  I now have some big bitcoin sites as well.  I got out of the adult and more into mainstream white hat marketing now days.  The tubes and other sites made it hard to make a decent profit without going extreme ninche and finding good black hat traffic sources.

Don't give them a fucking penny.  And be proud of yourself.  You believed in something and it made you money.  I'm all for helping loved ones but not when they mock something that you believe in.  People that love you will support your passion whatever they maybe.  
@_date: 2013-08-01 05:20:24
Well you should be really laughing at the dollar then because the premise behind its idiotic and backed by nothing.
@_date: 2013-07-19 07:05:53

@_date: 2013-07-11 06:22:32
Its just a good language.  We plan on adding an exchange to [Trade Bitcoin]( and it will all be done with RoR and Bootstrap 
@_date: 2013-09-13 16:49:19
Its a neat site.  Needs more products.  I have a large bitcoin site and was thinking about starting a shopping site with my idol domain just not sure where to start for products.
