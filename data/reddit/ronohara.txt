Terms and conditions matter.  They are quite clearly laid out as this post mentions: 
@_date: 2016-08-31 09:15:16
* (1) Put both public and private key in an email (no Subject: - everyone can read that)
* (2) Encrypt the email with PGP
* (3) send to yourself (multiple email addresses with different ISP's for backup)
Never forget your passphrase.
The slack way to do all that is use Thunderbird as your mail client, and install the Enigmail add on. Generate then Publish your PGP public key to the keyservers in Emingmail so that your friends can get it easily. Get your friends to do the same.
You should also send/receive as much of your email as possible encrypted with PGP - that way your cloud stored Bitcoin is just noise in your normal traffic. This also improves your email security in general.

It is not alarmist nonsense - it is precise warning from experienced people with large scale systems experience and understanding of how performance degradation works.
Try reading this fairly scholarly work: 
Notice in the graph on page two, a typical performance degradation pattern.
A lot of people think it is being sensible to try not to hit the rapidly escalating part of the curve. Since it takes a while to code, test and deploy any solution, the argument runs that, at the very least, we should implement a very simple minimum change (the 2Mb or higher limit) whilst building the other better ideas, which are complex, but offer higher levels of scaling up.
The 2Mb limit is not mutually exclusive with Segwit, LN and other ideas. We need them all, and we can use the simplistic 2M change to avoid the nasty part of the degradation curve. 
I am very risk averse - planning simple steps of change that buy time, whilst working on good, though complex solutions is less risky than just hoping we do not hit that curve. Especially when there is now evidence of just where the curve starts to kick in. The 'stress test' in 2015 showed that point, and we are moving relentlessly towards that with normal transactions.

Brain dead article. Talks about 7tps as latency ... it is metric of capacity, not latency.
@_date: 2016-04-27 12:17:48
I do not see it as a product. I am specifically talking about the capacity limits of the current protocol. I want those limits to improve - and there are a number of ways to do that. They are *not* mutually exclusive.
Only one of them is being blocked by Core, and it is the simplest change. Already coded, and tested in alternative code bases. Every improvement for capacity in the protocol is needed.

There is one reason to hold some part of your portfolio in BTC held in cold storage.
**Lack of counter party risk**
Leaving all your assets in other stuff (except physical gold/silver) leaves you exposed to the predatory actions of .gov. Stealth theft via inflation, direct attack via taxes etc. AND if you use banks to hold things, you are exposed to their probable failure. (See Cyprus and the current arrangement in Greece)
All of these risks are *counter party risk*.  As well as that, no matter what you do, you are always exposed to *systemic risk* - if people at large no longer place any value on what you are holding, then you have lost your value.
BTC, Gold/Silver holdings (held directly) are only exposed to *systemic risk* - that is why you should "hold in the mean time".  Not 100% of your assets - obviously. Just a percentage that suits your risk tolerance.
Gold/Silver is the classic risk insurance play - BTC is the new kid on the block for that role and has a higher systemic risk, but has a lower carry cost, is way better for portability, and has effectively a zero counterfeit risk.
@_date: 2016-04-27 12:03:10
The idea that confirmations will slow if some miners stop mining is just plain wrong.
The difficulty adjustment every 2016 blocks corrects for changes in mining hashrate (up or down). There is a chance of a termporary slow down if a big percentage of miners turn off their equipment all at the same time - but that is extremely unlikely, and still corrects itself within a few weeks.
Clearly the author does not understand this aspect of Bitcoin.

AUD has similar problems. USD is over valued (20% up) - so there is a strong risk of a down slump...  CNY ... also a risk with a slowing Chinese economy.  GLD ... no - far too manipulated with naked shorts.

Adding a whole new set of functionality to Bitcoin, unrelated to it's original design goals, when that function can exist externally?  That would just be bloat and add more risk via the increase in complexity to the code.
As you point out, you have a nice external solution (NetLimiter) ... bolt the two together as you have done, and you get what you want.
Two separate tools, with two separate functions is a much more reliable approach than a single multifunction code monster.
Unix is built around the concept of small but easily built/tested tools that work together .... it works well and the same approach is the best one here.
If what you really want is a single unified view or bundle to help with installation or administration, then there is a tried and test approach of using a layer above the low level tools. That layer provides the nice interface (third function really), but just configures or runs the underlying tools...
A great example of that is Webmin - a Unix administration system - it provides NONE of the underlying work/services, but provides an elegant web based interface to dozens of underlying tools.

100% consensus is a stupid goal. Bitcoin itself only demands &gt;50% hash power to determine *consensus* on what is the longest (and thus valid) blockchain.
Effectively, for Bitcoin (as per the whitepaper) *consensus* is &gt;50% of the mining hash power - and any other level of consensus for anything else, like a software code base, is irrelevant

Making the hard LIMIT high (20mb), but setting the default max block size to a modest increase (say 1Mb rather than  the current default of 750kb), would a way to take on the hard fork now, but not really take on the more contentious issues about bandwidth until later, and that also makes the up take to an increased effective limit strictly under the control of consensus by the miners, but that would happen well after the hard fork and only as the transaction load demands it.
Remember, only miners can create a block. The rest just need to deal with what the majority of miners are using.

An unsuccessful fork can not have any technical impact. Assume 30% of miners allow the larger limit of 20mb.  Any time they mine a block over 1Mb, it gets rejected by the majority of the network .... and becomes a ~~orphan~~[stale]( block on the split chain.
The moment a &lt;1mb block is published, the majority of the network (70%) accepts it as the next block - not the large block just generated by the 20mb supporting code.  Just like the situation when two miners generate a new block really close together in time and both try to claim the block reward ... one of them wins by being on what ends up as the longer chain.
SO.. the world will never see any effects of an unsuccessful fork.
I could run any variant of the protocol I like - Eg. Block reward 9000 BTC per block ... a hard fork ... but the network will reject that, unless/until a majority suddenly updates to match my (crazy) hard fork.
Same goes for higher block size limit - it will not take effect until &gt;50% of the network agrees, and when/if they do, miners using the  smaller limit better upgrade in a hurry, because the majority of the network will rapidly leave them behind.
@_date: 2015-06-03 10:29:26
Just looking at the blockchain is not covering all the Bitcoin usage.
One major usage is currency speculation and/or hedging.  That usually means activity at exchanges.... except for deposit/withdraw of BTC, the other activity inside exchanges never gets recorded in the blockchain.  Some (a lot?) of the activity on exchanges is fake ... BUT ... a lot is not.
Take an example.  btc-e.com ... right now shows a 24hour volume of trade as 10812 BTC ... but I have no idea how many transactions there were - a lot though. And btc-e is only a 2nd tier exchange ... perhaps under 10% of the activity we know about.
Overall, almost all of the Forex transactions for BTC do not show up in the blockchain.
Since converting to/from national fiat is a major portion of transactions at the moment, you can reasonably say that the "on blockchain" activity is only a small part of what is going on.

First off, the limit is 21,000,000 Bitcoins.... you are referring to a smaller unit - the Satoshi.  The suggestion is that we could carve up the Bitcoins into even smaller units - but not issue any EXTRA Bitcoins.
If 2.1 quadrillion Satoshis are allow to be divided into 100th Satoshis, there is no inflation ... just even smaller units you can use for more precise recording of assets and transactions.
Similar: 170,000 tonnes of gold ... the fact that we now frequently measure gold in grams, or even milligrams, does not increase the amount of gold .. IE. No inflation of the money supply.
Start using micrograms instead - so what - no inflation, just more precise measurement

If we get to the point where a cup of coffee is worth 10 Satoshi's the psychology will probably change ... just like individuals do not think about tonnes of gold, by then they are unlikely to worry about whole Bitcoins.

Even though not obvious, have faster blocks alters the curve of the currency distribution plan. IE. a change to the economic parameters.
And on top of that, the network load is exactly the same total as if you increase the block limit - which changes less code and is thus less risky;
SegWit is good idea - but because of the complexity is no answer to our near term capacity crunch. Only BIP101 is tested solution. Bitcoin_Unlimited is under test now. The other proposals are vapourware.

A non contentious way to achieve the identical result is to allow more decimals ... currently set to 8 digits (a Satoshi) ... if ever needed, the protocol can be revised to more decimal places.  Not a trivial change because of the testing needed, but not politically contentious.

They CAN skim profits from transactions.
How?  Just revert to the old banking model that arose to support gold/silver transactions.
With Bitcoin, we already know that most people will never really be able to do their security well enough to protect their funds. They use Windows for starters! So offer a service that securely hods people's Bitcoin on deposit... and maybe have it insured (by the govt) ... FDIC
So - start by creating a Bitcoin 'bank' - old style banking.
Then shift into fractional reserve banking ... still old style banking. Yes that is possible Ref: [Fractional Reserve](
  Obvious then you do lending to customers based on that... Charge them interest.
Then invent any other services you like - Futures, CDO's etc.
Bitcoin provides all the Interbank services that are currently very expensive at a very low cost. No more need for correspondent banks or SWIFT.
Bitcoin is effectively M1 for the world..   But the bankers make their money (currently) from M2 and M3 structured things... they can still do that based around a Bitcoin M1 just as easily as they did around Gold/Silver M1 (coins)

This is Open Source - creating a hard fork source that is **a** solution to the impending throughput issue is a normal tactic. It can be ignored by people is they wish. Or they can build, test and offer alternative solutions - the market can and will decide.
At present there are zero available, ready to run temporary solutions. Bitcoin-XT will be available early enough to provide an essential option - an instant get out of jail card for everyone. The blocksize debate goes back years if you read the dev mailing list, and there has been no forward movement in the reference implementation.
Moving the debate forward, regardless of how provocative the moves were, seems to have been necessary in light of the intense inertia of the core developers. At least now we are likely to have some outcome before the transaction load causes a catastrophic failure.
FYI: Technical discussions occur primarily on the dev mailing list - not reddit
On the word *consensus*
With Bitcoin, consensus is what defines the active blockchain - but that is consensus (amongst miners) about the longest valid chain. Disputes are always resolved by the mining process of the next block (or blocks in the extreme case).
Consensus in the code development and/or protocol details would be nice - but ultimately it gets resolved by the choices the miners make. Miners and **only** miners add new blocks to the blockchain. What they choose, is *the* consensus.
Given that about 60% of the hash rate, in the form of the Chinese mining groups, has already agreed publicly to an 8Mb max block size, then in due course, that will become an accepted protocol change - regardless of what the reference implementation developers do.

This all about 'trust' .... world wide, banks do not trust each other all that much. So the settlement networks are agreements that have plenty of room for verifications and time is allowed for revoking transactions.

Move to anon account on Cryptsy .... (new throwaway email, access only via tor from randomly changing free wifi hotspot)
Trade into DASH (rebranded Darkcoin) .... move from Cryptsy to private DASH wallet. 
Create new anon email, access Cryptsy again - new account, via tor (from new randomly chosen wifi hotspot)

At this point the BTC you now hold is totally unconnected to the original payment.
Use that BTC sparingly and convert into local fiat as you need.

As the OP says, after March 2013 was when the first thing people encountered was NOT the bitcoin-qt (a full node), and SPV wallets became more of the default choice.
If you include 2014, does that sudden shift become obvious, and a stabilisation after that (with a slight downward drift for laggards moving to an SPV wallet) become obvious.
If so GMaxwell is being manipulative with the cherry picking of data points.

Bitcoin is brilliant for small value remittances where fees and lousy exchange rates normally apply. It is less useful for large amounts (at the moment)
For large amounts, do NOT just do an international bank transfer. The large banks normally snap up about 5% by giving a terrible exchange rate.
DO find a reputable currency transfer broker.  They usually will give rates of about 0.5% below the spot rate.
Verify how that broker works by sending a modest amount first - say a couple of thousand CAD.
I transferred large amounts from GBP to AUD and then AUD to GBP via the usual banks for a few years before I realised how much they were grabbing. Once I discovered the Forex brokers I worked out that I could have saved myself over 15k GBP in those earlier transfers.... very pissed off at the banks and now I avoid them for Forex at every opportunity. Some of the other services from the banks are fine, but they are a total ripoff for Forex.
PS: Extra hint. CAD/EUR is probably collapsing because of Greece in the near future... do not be in a rush to convert, or hedge by converting only half.

In the 2nd example given by OP, Adam Back says:


peripherally related.  Even if in the extremis 75% of miners tried a
unilateral hard-fork but 100% of the users stayed on the maintained


reward (mining fork-coins with no resale value) and the difficulty
would adjust.  The miners who made an error in choice would lose money


I do not think he is right - lets assume 75% of miner go with 'big block', and 100% of non miners stay with the 1Mb limit..
The 25% mining small blocks will get all orphans after the first big block is mined, and everything they mine will be rejected by the majority of miners. IE. The chain splits... but now the minority miners are still mining against a huge difficulty with only 25% of the hash rate... so they are (on avg) mining a block every 40 minutes on the losing chain. That will become very obvious..  even the downward drift of difficulty on the losing chain (the 25% miners) will not correct things for them for a LONG time...
I would bet that the 25% group of miners will hurriedly update so as not to lose their investment ... but even if they do not, the 100% non miners are forced to change for the same reason ... laggards lose money once the majority of miners move.
In fact, that underlying process is exactly what the basic Bitcoin design is.
51% consensus rules, and if you ignore that consensus there is an economic penalty for backing the minority view.  As they say in Thailand  **"up to you"**
So Adam is focusing on consensus in the code development process - and that, whilst nice if it happens, is irrelevant - *consensus among the miners is what controls acceptance of new blocks to the chain, and changes to the protocol.*
@_date: 2015-06-24 05:33:55
I already run XT ... and when the update is applied I will automatically get the change in place
People do not seem to understand ... Non miners can upgrade their software (by using XT) - and never be affected - even if the miners decide to stay at 1Mb ... the revised software happily runs on the current rules OR the larger block size. That makes it a no brainer for a node that is not mining.
Funny stuff about the bandwidth issues. I have a small home DSL link ... only 665kb uplink ,,,, yet as an experiment, I found that I can run a nodes for (1) bitcoin, (2) namecoin (3) litecoin and (4) dash   ---- all at once, with no real problems. All on some ancient (spare) laptop hardware.

You might be surprised to know that at the board level there is often exactly the same frustration with middle management.
Anyone who has gone through the startup to large process as a founder is very aware on the conflict of agendas that middle management brings to the situation.

Very slanted article. Uses emotive terms and absolutely misses the point about Mikes Bitcoin-XT changes.
All this stuff is Open Source - and Bitcoin itself is a protocol.  So - being Open Source, anyone is free to create or derive an implementation of a Bitcoin full node,  There are a few already competing implementations.
The blocksize debate is about altering the reference implementation - Bitcoin-core - and thus influencing all the other implementations into adjusting to the needs of large blocks.
Bitcoin-XT is just one of the the software choices - maintained by Mike Hearn (I believe), so he is free to do what he likes with it, and you are free to ignore it, or use it (I already do).
It is a market place for ideas and software - a free market. It is actually the miners who decide, just like they decide which blocks are (by consensus) the blocks that make up the blockchain.
Since only miners extend the blockchain, all other full nodes need to follow any changes to the protocol that are accepted by &gt;51% of the miners. Otherwise nodes that fall behind in accepting whatever the miners chose, will soon find they a following a chain that no longer works.

I am one of the people who called out luke-jr the last time he enabled non-default tweaks for Gentoo.
However, he has a long history of good work too. In the most recent discussions about the 20Mb blocksize proposals, he takes a consistent and logically argued position. I disagree with him, but that is fine.
In that debate he points out that bandwidth limits will affect nodes in areas of the world with lousy bandwidth, including where he is. I agree about that effect, but contend that  a perceived 'failure' of the Bitcoin network under load, would be a much worse problem than the slight drift towards centralisation the needing good bandwidth implies.
A suggestion to .... offsite your development node(s) to a well connected remote data centre (with actual code still on your own site). This knocks the local bandwidth requirement a lot - at the cost of some host charges and an increase in complexity for your development environment.
I have had to do this myself in the past, so I know it is possible/practical.

There are lots of guides... but you need to be a masochist to use PGP from the command line.
The dead easy way is:
- Install Thunderbird (and hook up to your email account)
- Use Thunderbird to add Enigmail to itself. (add ons)
- Use the Enigmail menu item that was added to Thunderbird (under Key Management) to Generate a PGP key pair for your email address
- Publish that key to the world keyservers (using Enigmail menu) - so other people can find you.
That is it... you can now send encrypted email.
Receiving and decrypting means finding/importing the public key (once) of some one sending you an email.. Very easy from the Key Management sub menu of Enigmail, or you can import keys on the fly from messages.
One thing I do is alter the default settings so that Enigmail tries to encrypt outgoing mail by default - but that is up to you ... it is very flexible, but unobtrusive if you like things to Just Work (TM)
PM me for help if you like - and for testing of sending PGP encrypted email back and forth.
EDIT.  I should have mentioned.
Enigmail adds three buttons at the top of the screen for when you are writing a message:
- Encrypt
- Sign
- Attach copy of my public key.
Click on the button(s) that you want to apply to any message you write - trivial to use on daily basis.

There is always some BTC supply available ... what it costs you in terms of effort to get that BTC is a different question.
So ... in addition to allowing for the principal and interest costs in repaying your loan, you should also factor in the probably deflation costs of the currency.
That means that you would be better off borrowing in your local national fiat currency, since your central bank is busily inflating away the value of that currency and in so doing, reducing the 'amount' of value that you need to repay that loan.
Borrowing in a fiat currency is a good strategy. Saving in hard money (Gold, Silver, Bitcoin) is a good strategy.  The inverse is also true.
Saving in a fiat currency is bad strategy. Borrowing in hard money is usually a bad strategy.
Borrowing is generally a bad idea unless the funds are used for a truly productive enterprise - which hard money tends to enforce. Borrowing in fiat allows mal-investment to survive a lot longer, with severe structural consequences in the economy, which is what most of the world is seeing right now.

Ripple may just succeed here by providing indirect support of Bitcoin. Banks can invest in proprietary technology and in the case of problems point at the supplier and say ... it is their fault ... not us.
Think of Ripple (and XRP) as trying to be a new Microsoft - reinventing a new operating system - not as good as existing players, but with a good sales team. The main difference is that there were no Open Source options competing with Microsoft at the start. In the crypto currency world, the market leader (and market creator) is Open Source. That is a more difficult starting point.
In the corporate world, having someone to blame is normal CYA, and Ripple is effectively saying 'blame us'.   Just like 20 years ago you could not get Open Source stuff accepted into the business IT world.... there was no one you shift the blame onto. Now you have Linux widely deployed - utterly essential - and Open Source.
You should see a rapid growth in companies doing for Bitcoin, what Redhat did for Linux in the large corporate arena.
Some of the existing players like IBM and SAS are potential movers for this opportunity. These players already have the high level contacts inside the banks to get integration projects funded. (for a fee of course)

There are a number of full node software implementations. Bitcoin XT is just the reference bitcoin core code with a small set of patches.
There is also bitcoinj and btcd that I know of.  Some miners use heavily customized variants of the reference source as well.
The core developers do NOT have arbitrary control of the Bitcoin protocol. That protocol is what the majority (&gt;50% hash power) chooses to use. So people can just use BitcoinXT and the big block code will not become active unless and until a majority of the miners (by hash power) do as well.
This is a good option, because BitcoinXT remains entire compatible with the current reference code, but will not slip behind if the miners (majority) do move to Gavin's path - and the Chinese miners have already publicly said they will support his latest proposal.  If the core developers will not respect that level of  miner support, by making the required changes to the reference code, then they risk becoming irrelevant.  The changes will be available to run - with or without the reference platform support. Some time after a majority of miners switches to that version of the protocol, every else is faced with the choice of joining them, or being left behind on a blockchain that stagnates with a very high difficulty, and very little hash power.
Gavin's most recent proposal requires a supermajority (&gt;75%) of hash power before it activates. On that basis, if the change does activate, the other 25% of miners will really have no choice. F2Pool does not have a blocking amount of hash even with Gavin's supermajority proposal.
I run BitcoinXT even though I am not mining. So my node will automatically cut over to the 8Mb protocol if needed, and will happily chug along if the switch does not happen.
On that basis BitcoinXT is a better selection of software for me - and anyone else that does not want to be caught out by this protocol change kicking in,

Ok  .. I do NOT think this is a real issue. Why?  Some one might shoot me down, but isn't the normal self interest feedback loop of members of a pool going to come into play here. (And that is what is being targeted in generating concern in the original post)
As I see it:


The collective (pool operator), MUST continue to follow the BitCoin protocol unchanged - or otherwise, as soon as the rather vigilant miners all around the world see any corruption of the protocol, lots of the participants in the large pool (GHash.io in this case), will leave and work with a different pool - the exact solution being suggested by initial post.
It is in the interests of a minority miner working through a mining pool, to only work with an honest pool.
So do not confuse a &gt;50% mining pool, with the &gt;50% attack possible with a single miner.
Just stay hyper vigilant that if there is a pool with &gt;50%  ... that it is following the BitCoin protocol.

Decentralised systems that match or exceed the functionality of centralised systems win - eventually.  We have not seen decentralised money since the propaganda war against Gold/Silver usage as currency (firstly in the British Empire and then in the USA) was largely successful.

Bitcoin has all the advantages of national fiat currencies, but overcomes the corruption problems they introduced. It does not remove the older corruption problems that exist for both Gold and National fiat. IE. Theft, fraud... scams built on lies.

Miners like safe predictable revenue - rather than the lottery implicit in block mining. Because we have a steadily increasing hash rate, getting rewards early is critical... ask any BFL customer still awaiting delivery of their hardware what the delay is doing to the estimated ROI.  That problem is all because of the increasing hash rate.  
But - when the mining boom tails off (yes it will), at about the time BTC gets halfway through it's overall adoption curve (that is just a guess - both 'half way', and who knows what the ultimate adoption level will be).... and things are running at a consistent hash rate... using a pool stops being advantageous... then the edge will be about power costs, durability of hardware, network transmission costs and so on.
For now though, the overwhelming influence on profitability for a miner is getting in early ... so revenue smoothing tactic like pool mining is very attractive.

Inflationary currency systems support and encourage corruption and wars of aggression at the expense of the general (productive) population - which is why they are so loved by politicians.

Deflationary currency systems support and encourage saving and cautious productive approaches to life - which helps the general population, but force limits on corrupt middlemen.

One important thing most people get wrong is the 'delay' - everyone quotes the 10 minute target of block production... but that is the delay between blocks. Just like having a train go past your platform every 10 minutes.
The delay the customer sees (the average latency) is HALF the time between blocks. The same as if you walk on to the platform at some random time, the average time you will wait for the next train is HALF of interval between trains.
This makes the average wait for the BTC transaction to be accepted as 5 minutes. 
Sometimes more, sometimes less  ....  average latency for being served, is not the same as the average time for the next block to be produced.

According to this ...      Blocks are currently averaging 12 minutes, which is exactly what you would expect as the hash rate declines. Just like it was about 9 minutes while the hash rate exploded.
The (slightly) slower block rate implies more transactions stored per block, and a slower re-assessment of difficulty which might be interesting... also means that the 'halving' will be pushed back to near when the design 10 minute block rate was supposed to happen I guess.

Clearly not the 'best' in terms of security ... cold storage of your own coins with zero counter party risk meets that definition of 'best'.... but perhaps the 'best' compromise of security and ease of use - these two desirable attributes are in conflict.
For me, I err on the side of security. You can deal with 'ease of use' by educating yourself... or at least some people can.
Removing counter party risk is much higher in my life outlook that most other people.  I flatly do not trust third party systems and use  them only when unavoidable and as briefly as possible.  Eg,  trade on btc-e.com and then extract to local paper wallets at the end of the session, is the way to be involved with a dubious 3rd party, but limit your risk to the size of the transaction(s) and the duration that your funds are held by them.

I notice one mistake that lots of commentators make here.
The author correctly points out that BTC (and gold... etc) have no 'intrinsic' value - in fact nothing does. What everything may have is 'utility value'... IE it is useful for something. And on that front, BTC is incredibly useful as a payments mechanism via the Internet, and also has the 'utility' of avoiding the theft of assets by central banks via QE .. aka money printing.
Both attributes are useful to a significant percentage of the planet's population. That is what is driving the re-pricing that we see for BTC....  The more people discover that these attributes are useful to them, the high the setting of the price discovery that we are watching.

mostly true. But.... some of the recent Intel motherboard bios setups have embedded wifi stacks that you can not disable and can remotely access everything in the system - regardless of what OS you boot.
To defeat the NSA with that sort of hardware, you need to use a faraday cage and/or remove the wifi. Also remove bluetooth and ethernet chips.... disable or remove internal camera, and kill the speaker(s) and microphone in the system.

the state (as shown many times throughout history) is incompetent at managing the economy. That is why empires rise and fall... at the start, the state is small enough in relation to the underlying economic activity to offer efficiencies in controlling some areas of activity.  Eg, building/managing roads, power grids, water, sewerage etc ..
Later in the cycle, the centralisation of power that arises from these monopolies facilitates broad corruption that destroys the efficiency advantage ... then the beneficiaries of the state system gradually overwhelm the productive parts of the economy and all opportunities are strangled.
The process takes quite a while (more than a single lifetime in the past) .. though with faster communication the clycle is getting faster.
People involved at the start of a new empire love it and firmly believe it is a brilliant and infallible new system ... those at the tail end during the decline hate it and eventually it collapses - often violently.

The charge back issue is not the same as the potential theft of your bitcoins.
Bitcoin simply removes  the possibility of fraudulent access to your funds as a result of merchant (or any third party) security problems. It does demand that you have decent security for your private keys though.  Since that is hard for many people, a mid point is the hosted wallet, where you trust a single entity with your funds, but delegate the security problem to a hopefully more competent person.
Charge back then becomes un-necessary for dealing with fraudulent purchases... but is still needed for customer/merchant dispute scenarios. Eg,  'You sent me a broken product ... I want a refund'
This kind of 'charge back' could also be handled as an additional service by the 'hosted wallet' provider... by using an escrow tactic with the merchant. The escrow approach (which works well) is still seen as esoteric by most consumers.... but can be made transparent if needed.
Overall, adding this layer of security and escrow to the basic Bitcoin payment system will add a cost - but less than the cost of fraud related charge backs, as current needed.

There is one other coin which shares the technical network that gives Bitcoin it's strength.  NameCoin .... not really a coin, and it is merge-mined along with Bitcoin.
It is currently only used to support the .bit top level domain, in a decentralised secure way that is outside the ICANN control.... ICANN is effectively the 'central bank' of domain names, with all the potential corruption issues that implies. NameCoin is the way to bypass them... but it is potentially much more.  It can (by design) provide a decentralised secure record of almost anything. A share register, a land title register, copyright registration and so on ... 
Honest money ala Bitcoin, is only the first item of the disruptive effects of having a global, incorruptible way of recording human interaction. NameCoin shows the way for other uses of this concept. Record your marriage using NameCoin (with pre-nup document attached) .... voila ... very difficult for either party to now lie to a divorce court.... and much cheaper to collect the evidence to present at the court.
Same idea for commercial contracts ... and if the other party refuses to record the contract in this openly honest way ... well you do not want to deal with them.... 
And honesty metric that has never been available before - that is breathtakingly disruptive.. NameCoin as it evolves has true potential too - it works alongside Bitcoin, but not in competition.

Well the ups/downs of day trading, and the antics of whales, still have no long term effect on the growing utilisation for actual trade. That fundamental will eventually force the price in national currencies upward, albiet with many swings up and down on that generally upward path. Stabilisation will only come when the adoption curve peaks.
Limited supply + growing demand = upward re-pricing.
IF adoption stops or reverses, then downward pricing... but until then - long term - "to the Moon" (or more realistically ... a bit higher than now)
At present BTC represents less that 0.0015% of the aggregate GDP of all nations... the maximum it be asked to deal with is 100%  ... so expect some growth for a few years to come.  :-)

Strictly speaking, retail banks are not under threat by Bitcoin.
Their original business model is a service industry in handling the safe storage of a trade token (gold) for people who have difficulty doing that.
They also facilitated easy transfer of ownership of those tokens (cheques)
They added fractional reserve lending to that model.
They also added easy trusted transmission of funds (via letters of credit originally)
Many people will need or want the same service with Bitcoin as a token - (including fractional reserve lending!).
Central banks on the other hand are totally in the line of fire. Bitcoin is a total replacement for their 'function' of monetary policy.
Buffet could take the same approach he always has, with success, even if Bitcoin was the global reserve currency. The only thing he would probably get less of, is government handouts.

In the credit card world, contesting charges relies on the ability to reverse a bank transaction, and in the bitcoin world transactions do not get reversed.
Effectively with credit cards, the merchant is already accepting a long escrow by Visa/MC (usually 90 days).. he gets the value in his bank account, but may be forced to accept a later reversal. If he could convince his bank to prevent that, he would be removed from Visa as a merchant - quite a serious impact.
Now you can use a direct bitcoin escrow process or a multi-way transfer (N of M signatures) and the merchant would not have the interim use of funds... IE worse than using Visa.
BUT if wallet company (call them bPal) becomes very big (like Visa), they could have merchant agreements that mimic the credit card companies, and get actual pre-payment in a normal bitcoin transaction, with the proviso, that if a dispute is resolved against the merchant, they must refund the payment to bPal on pain of being cut off from being a bPal merchant if they fail to do so,
This approach would exactly replicate the credit card approach - and would be more expensive to run than simple escrow.
So with bitcoin you can layer the functionality to provide low cost dispute handling (escrow) which has cashflow implications for the merchant or mimic what Visa does - at different % costs in each case.
I am just pointing out that with Bitcoin you can have a range of approaches - with credit cards you only have one approach - and that one has massive fraud problems.

Think of the blockchain as the top layer of a financial ledger system... a very simple ledger rather than the 'General Ledger' used for accounting .... but a top level ledger none the less.
Think of side coins as 'sub-ledger', offering specialized facilities not found  in the main ledger, but just like in an accounting system (which has specialised sub ledgers too), each sub ledger is intimately tied to the main ledger.
It allows delegation of work loads (performance enhancing), and extension of functionality without mistakes in the side coin risking the stability of the main ledger (the blockchain).

Price inflation (not changes in the money supply) steals from savers who rightly hate it.
You say commodity money is bad, but offer no explanation for that conclusion. Historically, the world ALWAYS used commodity money - until the Chinese invented paper.
The advantage of commodity money is that it has limits of supply. That attribute holds governments and banks in check. Helping prevent the myriad of abuses that seem to flow from people in power.
The best commodity money, has the attribute of being of no use for anything else related to survival. Historically that was gold. It is only recently that we have found any industrial use for it.
Bitcoin, as a commodity style money is even better in that attribute. It has zero uses related to survival and no possible alternate uses as an industrial input.
USD goes to auction every second of the day, and the price (measured in other currencies) fluctuates all the time.  The USD also goes to auction every day in another way, when it is exchanged for goods or services, and on that front has a history of permanent decline. Measured in real goods, the USD has declined in value well over 90% in the last century.
Gold [physical] can be compared the same way - and it's purchasing power also fluctuates from day to day and over time. But it is MUCH more stable than any fiat currency.
Try this site:    to see how you can view things from outside the USD/Euro fiat mind set. Pay particular attention to the charts.  Oil - priced in Gold is a good one.
The apparent 'stability' of valuation that you point to with USD / Euro is an illusion. The huge liquidity and market depth of those (as trading tokens) means that on a daily, weekly or annual basis, volatility is low.  But long term, all fiat currencies that debase their value via deliberately creating price inflation (printing excess money supply) end up failing. People relying on a currency like that to store their savings, lose everything.
Bitcoin is volatile, simply because it's utilisation for real trade is tiny. That   makes the FX market for it (eg pricing in USD) very small and illiquid.
If the user base expands a lot - volatility will decrease.

Bear in mind that transaction processing needs only a fraction of that hashing power (and the difficulty comes down to match the reduced power)
The total throughput is not affected by more or less hashing power. The hashing power is only needed to prevent 51% attacks..  IE it needs to be the maximum possible so that no one else can overwhelm the security.
If we did not have nasty people (and govt's) that try to pervert any system. we could use a fairly trivial amount of hardware and electricity to support the same transaction throughput.

A huge number of people 'value' physical gold - because as a long term store of value is has an unsurpassed track record. Even though it is problematic for securing, transporting and can be counterfeited, making it difficult for use in trade.
Bitcoin is brand new in any historical view, but has the potential to be as good as gold for store of value (might take a few centuries to gain world wide trust near that of gold). It is also easier to store and secure than gold and can not be counterfeited. Add to that a better level of global 'transfer' than even FRN's via SWIFT allow, and you have a currency, that IF it gains wide usage, will be valued greatly by the people that use it.
Currently, people seem to be valuing Bitcoin at about 5 barrels of oil .... the same people value FRN's as about 0.02 barrels of oil.
So utility attributes of competing currency systems is what generates the 'foreign exchange' rates - speculation by assorted traders generates the volatility :-)

Banks often do this.... and for security and privacy it is fine.  However, you lose control of your record of communication.
Your bank can and does delete the messages as they see fit. Normally they will only retain messages for whatever they deem a suitable period.  After that you have lost any record of the conversation.
That makes it worse than PGP.
With PGP, both parties to the communication have a copy of the communication in their own control.
If a dispute arises, and you are cut off from the bank system you lose that record - exactly when you will need those records to support your case in a dispute.

It does not have a script version. The transaction version (2) is the defined part of the hard fork. The HF itself proposes that script processing in version 2 is *identical* to version 1 - so where is the design problem?
Scripts in Bitcoin are not versioned in the current system. You simply can not get the multi-sig problem you describe.
You can get rogue code bases that ignore the rules - but that is already handled by the consensus system. No change to dealing with the issue is needed.

Aside from Bitcoin adding competition to the fiat world and probably forcing it to improve efficiency of fiat for transactions (which is what you note above), it is also offering a competing currency model.
The (misnamed) Kensian approach with central banks controlling the money supply, versus the Austrian style control of money supply via an intrinsic limit [like gold availability].
Which approach is more desirable? and for whom ?   ... govts love to debase fiat currencies by printing more and more money and exploding the money supply as it removes big debts that they run up to have wars and buy elections - at the expense of people who save.  People who work and save SHOULD like the Austrian approach, but sadly most never understand this. Instead they believe the never ending torrent of propaganda in the media about 'needing' 2% inflation.
That is flatly wrong - what is desirable is to balance the money supply against the currency needs of the population. If population goes up and productivity is stable, you need a matching increase in money supply to ensure zero price inflation. Similarly, if population decreases with stable productivity, you need a decrease in money supply to ensure zero price inflation.
That sort of thing with lots of other variables besides productivity and population, means we are assuming that the central banks are utter geniuses are calculating the right level of money supply (and they have inaccurate data to work from), and that they operate outside political pressures.   Yeah right .... never going to work. 
So Bitcoin offers an approach to an honest predictable Austrian style monetary system like gold, but with the globe spanning payment ability that the Kensian fiat systems have developed into. Plus an improvement over gold in prevention of counterfeiting, and possibilities of storage approaches that are invisible and immune to theft via coercion.
Some of the world will choose to use this version of money. The real question is how many people?
That will control the exchange rate into other fiat currencies and real world goods and services.
IE. What percentage of the (approx) USD$100T of world commercial activity will be mapped against the 21 million BTC (2 quadrillion Satoshi)? 
EDIT: Formatting and typos
EDIT:  
The estimate of USD$100T for world commercial activity is the total current estimate of approx $70T of official global trade plus the estimate of $30T for the black economy (System D as it is often referred to)

A bit of proper maths please...  assume that blocks arrive on average every 2.5 minutes... like a train every 2.5 minutes.
Now insert a transaction at a random time ... just like walking onto the platform at a random time.
The average time you will wait for the next block (or train), is HALF the time between blocks (or trains) ... this is the average latency, which is a different thing to the average interval between blocks.
So .. for BTC - the average latency is 5 minutes
and for LTC - the average latency is 1.25 minutes
From a human perspective, that is fairly fast.  Even when waiting for a Visa transaction to confirm, the whole process often takes around 1 minute...

and FT does not currently support the concept of versioning scripts. So it can not have the multi-sig problem you describe.
IF script versioning is added as a concept to Bitcoin (regardless of FT or other BIP as the source) your point is quite relevant. But for FT as proposed this issue just does not exist.
The tag for 'version' could be 'version of x data field' as much as version of script I expect to use... in the input Tx format. It is up to the protocol to be extended to support recording attributes of persistent information such as scripts and FT is not suggesting that.

If all 70,000 inhabitants get involved, Bitcoin **could** become the official currency of the Dominican Republic.

Using the blockchain approach in this way may be valid ... but only in the sense that it is a permissioned access, distributed database.
Use in this fashion has performance problems when compared to other RDBMS tools  ...BUT .... does match the need of a set of entities (banks) who do not really trust each other totally.  That is a use case for a private blockchain. One that is not open to everyone.
However, you still need an internal currency or some other mechanism to prevent a 'bad actor' within the set of participants perverting the chain.
You could consider it to be a private alt-coin ... block creation (mining) would remain a weak point that hackers could potentially attack. Eg. If this chain is using POW ... a hacker penetrates the network and uses ASICs to overpower the other participants and generate bogus transactions.
Compare that to Bitcoin, where you just do not have a network security issue. All the nodes assume that there are hostile players. The protection comes from the huge hashing power of the network, which makes hacking infeasible.

Support from non-miners does not mean that SegWit Tx format will be mined..  it needs 95% miner support (according to the documentation) to avoid a security risk where miners could steal coins.

So hard forks have risks? Nothing new in that - it is not specific to the FT proposal. And it is not 'anything could happen' - more accurately 'anything can be proposed' with a hard fork. 
FT is a specific proposal - detailed and controlled in scope. It does not propose the risks that you are talking about.
The fork proposed is to leave the script rules unchanged. Any implementation that does not do that is a rogue code base and consensus around the proposed HF will ignore rogue nodes just as the current  setup does.
It is inaccurate of you to say the change is unsafe in the specific area of script versioning, when the proposal of the HF is to make **no change** to that.
IE. Version 1 transactions (the current system) and Version 2 transactions (FT) are proposed to be identical in script processing.

I checked directly with Tom Zander about this possible design bug about varying script versions undermining multi-sig.
In essence, this 'design flaw' does not exist, because there is no 'version' with scripts in Flexible Transactions. Scripts are unchanged from the way they have always worked.
More interestingly is that the version number **is** available in SegWit - so that design flaw **is** part of SegWit... thank you for highlighting this ~~problem~~design issue with SegWit
One straightforward way to go forward, would be to say if the script has no associated version, then it is assumed to be the original format and must be processed according to that set of rules. If the script does have a version associated with it, then the rule of processing it must be that set of rules.
Like saying if someone says 'python' - assume python 2.7  ... otherwise use the version they actually demand. Eg  'python-3.3'
Python is a good example, because it too is a script language, and the different versions allow different language features (and even different syntax's)
@_date: 2017-02-02 08:01:26
The HF is clear.  old rules = new rules.... identical.  So zero risk for this particular proposal. 


Obviously the current design can not know about future HF changes. You are implying that we can only ever use a soft fork, as only a soft fork can ever meet this odd requirement (of yours).
A hard fork explicitly *changes the rules*. As long as the change is explicit, extremely limited and well tested, that is fine. Part of the FT proposal is that script processing remains **identical** to version 1 - precisely to avoid issues like you suggest with multi-sig.
Miners could steal SegWit funds because of a hole in the approach that SegWit is forced to use to achieve a soft fork. FT does not have similar issues precisely because it accepts a hard fork approach.
SegWit could be a much simpler implementation if it used a hard fork - and that 95% uptake requirement to avoid the stealing funds issues is so large that you may as well have gone the hard fork route.

Corroborating your ID to one or more Bitcoin address takes a fair bit of effort - but not if the emails from an exchange give that away in the clear !!

I also get PDF statements from my bank. But it is downloaded directly from the bank website via a https:// link ... so it is delivered via an encrypted link, and only at my explicit request.
I would guess that your bank is sending it as an attachment via normal email (which is very poor privacy), but only because you 'elected' to have them do this.
If that is the case, then you have given your bank your consent to communicate with you in an insecure way...
The same argument would apply if exchanges allow (but do not require) PGP encryption of their emails to their customers.  What I am concerned about is the lack of this option on most exchanges.

It sets a maximum number of transactions per block ... with an average of 1 block every 10 minutes, the theoretical maximum is 7 tx/sec ... but only if they are all the smallest transaction data size.   Based on the real world actual transaction data size, the effective maximum is about 3 tx/sec.

But by definition of the FT HF - there is only one version of the script system - regardless of whether it was entered via the current Tx format or an FT format Tx.
IE. FT does not introduce any concept of script version - it does not need to.
If some future proposed HF changes rules - so what. After FT the scripts are still all the same as at present so people will need to consider that proposal at that time. Nothing to do with what FT proposes.
If you want to introduce script versioning (and the idea does have merit), it is a separate step from what is currently proposed with FT. By all means work that through, use a new BIP, but it is not relevant to what is proposed by FT.

Business that use Bitcoin (directly or via BitPay et al) all have the same security problems that come from using any currency...  agreed.

Bitcoin however is not at risk from Central Banker printing to devalue your savings.... quite the opposite.  Same as physical gold, but with better options for storage and transport.
The solution to your concerns are not in the security side of the equation. It can only be dealt with by suitable risk management. Which is exactly what you do by holding BTC in paper wallet(s)  - I presume multiple wallets to reduce risk.
No doubt you still leave a small amount of currency in hot wallet(s) - a phone perhaps. Or web wallet(s) ....   but you are choosing the amount of your savings to risk....

Bahhh  ... NOTHING has intrinsic value.  Many things have assorted attributes. People place a (personal) value on those attributes.  Since it is a personal assessment of how valuable any given attribute is, the valuations vary from person to person. And from time to time.
Bitcoin has attributes that help people to transact at distance with unknown persons with minimal risk. Attributes that prevent counterfeiting. Attributes that allow you to hide its usage as an asset from prying eyes - both Govts and robbers.
People tend to assess these sort of attributes as rather valuable to them.
But there is no such thing as INTRINSIC value - just intrinsic attributes.

Too true...
So do not use any of the more complex side of Bitcoin (HD, P2SH).  Generate single raw address(es) [1....format] and their private key, using some tool like bitaddress.org (offline)... print the public/private key pair onto laminated paper... save copies in your safe and/or with your executor(s).
Split up your funds across a few paper wallets and share the details sparingly.  You can even PGP encrypt an email to yourself at multiple email address(s) with the private/public key pairs if you want a very safe cloud storage version of the same sort of thing, though that presumes you will be able to read those emails and use PGP in the future.
These are all cold storage tactics. You will need some wallet that supports easy cold storage access when you need the funds. OR be prepare to enter that long private key manually - which assumes you have 'version 1.0 eyeballs' available :-)

(1) is a bit of a problem. The whole concept of users doing *intelligent* things all the time is flawed. I ran an ISP franchise system (CTO) for 4 years. 24x7 customer base - they do the dumbest of things!.  Visa et.al **hide** their fees - and as a result get no consumer level complaints. Not even all that many merchant level complaints.
(2) is a good optional idea - but needs a pragmatic default ... Eg. 2 months, and changing that should be an expert option - see (1). Regardless, Bitcoin needs to be **predictable** in how it manages 0-conf transactions.
(3) I dont agree. Being your own bank, IE a full node, has some costs, and even $50 a month is nothing compared to the costs that traditional banks have. If you can not justify being totally independent, then you can not. In that situation, you are constrained to using an SPV wallet and trusting someone to run a node. OR to organizing a collective group of friends and family, to support a node. Be your own bank for the people you trust and who trust you.
(4) - sync points. I agree, as long as they are optional, and you still have the ability to do a full synchronization.
(5) - thoroughly overdue. The intransigent Core developers who oppose this have shown themselves to be incompetent in the wider sense, OR have been bought/blackmailed into taking this stance.

Gold and Silver have a couple of properties that mean a derivative has advantages over the actual item.  Gold and Silver are both hard to secure, difficult to transport, and can be counterfeited.  Derivatives (paper claims on the asset) address those issues, but introduce counter party risk and market manipulation.
Bitcoin does not have those problems.... so derivatives offer no benefit.  It is just as easy to hold Bitcoin as any proposed derivative.  In fact, buy holding the Bitcoins directly you also avoid the counter party risk that derivatives add to the situation... 
The ONLY advantage derivatives have when dealing with Bitcoin is that they may cope with artificial legal barriers.  Eg. the derivative may have SEC blessing when Bitcoin itself does not.

That eliminates the need to integrate with the Bitcoin blockchain... facilitates to/from value changes via the existing exchange mechanisms...

Namecoin and the side chain functionality would benefit, and the Namecoin developers can be more courageous than the Bitcoin developers can tolerate.

But if you obtain your bitcoins via an exchange (most people do), then the emails that the exchanges broadcast in plain text instantly connect an email address to that lot of bitcoins ... it is very hard to get a local fiat currency converted to bitcoins without giving up your ID .. essentially you must use OTC and cash, which is onerous - and frequently unsafe.

"Urgent in May 2015" was describing a problem that is definitely coming, on a somewhat unpredictable timetable, where any solution needs a substantial lead time to build/test/rollout.
Gavin was right about the need to avoid the capacity crunch, even if it is not happening right now. If it happened in 4 weeks, would you be happy? I would not. The capacity crunch is a predictable and avoidable problem.
Not dealing with it in at least the temporary/trivial way that "Classic" is now offering, shows up a number of the "Core" developers as irresponsible.
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:08:09
Plain wrong - some raw capacity increase is essential in the near term - as long as usage continues to increase.
Suggesting that a fee market can solve a raw capacity issue is misdirection.
Take that 6c fee - you are right - who the hell cares about 6c?.  BUT, once the system is overloaded, the competition to get your Tx through, moves that upwards - exponentially.
6c becomes 60c, then $6, then $60 - at that point you really start to lose users, and .... bang goodbye Bitcoin - from failure of confidence. Then people will really lose money. Think Zimbabwe dollar.
So a fee market sounds fine, but only if we also address the actual capacity crunch that is clearly imminent. Things like SegWit and Lightning are fine (though inherently complex and hard to test), BUT we will still need some extra raw capacity (block limit) in the near future.
2Mb + Hardfork = bad?   Maybe there is a better choice, but *inaction* is guaranteed disaster.
If the choice is bad (but only according to some people), or disaster - I will take 'bad' for the extra time it gives everyone to argue about what is better. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:14:19
I want a bigger block limit now - but not because I think it is a long term scaling solution. It should not controversial because the risks in moving to 2Mb are clearly manageable (HF has happened before).
What 2Mb will give the community is the time to test and implement the much more complex ideas for longer term scalability.

I can guess a time just like anyone else ... and it would be just a guess. But unless Bitcoin adoption stalls, it seems likely to hit a tipping point this year.
I say 'tipping point' because capacity failures exhibit a non linear curve
 A well known quote from Ernest Hemmingway puts it well: “How did you go bankrupt?" Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly.
System capacity failure is well understood from resource issues in other aspects of computer systems.
Try this link: 
What I am talking about is what I see as a Geometric relationship between transaction load in Bitcoin versus transaction delay. This is an exact parallel of transaction load against a web server versus transaction delay. That is Geometric (not Linear).
What happens is that at some critical level, the backlog of transactions can not be cleared and the transaction delay of new transactions explodes (geometrically) to something unworkable. To all intents and purposes, the system has then failed under load (even though some transactions are still being processed)

You understand it the way I do. I was asking why he expected a Tx to cancel.
The arbitrary and random way 0-conf Tx disappears is a terrible approach. Consistent behaviour of system is essential for anyone to have confidence in them.
I have posted many times about the idea that 0-conf transactions need to be made 'safe' - never dropped. If that was the case, Bitcoin would be presenting a similar system to Visa.
When Visa says **Transaction Accepted** they are claiming that the transaction will (eventually) be processed. That is good enough for the retail POS market. Randomly forgetting Tx without any feedback is a terrible design.
We could add an extra function to full nodes. One that ensures any Tx a node sees, is not dropped from the mempool until it is put into a block. If it seems to disappear, that function would rebroadcast the Tx ... making it 'sticky' - still in the mempool. Never dropped.
I am sure Visa does lose one or two Tx every month - but nothing noticeable.
This would complete remove any 'need' for that disaster of an idea - RBF. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 10:12:45
It is a good thing that work on optimizing/replacing the old code has been done. Otherwise the capacity crunch would already have overtaken Bitcoin. However, that does not excuse ignoring the capacity planning problem.
I mention the trivial 'solution' that Classic is delivering. It is trivial - a doubling of the *limit* to the block size. Whilst that is not in any sense an overall solution, it *is* a safe, workable way to give Bitcoin (and the developers) a couple of years more breathing space to develop better things.
Ignoring the issue and allowing it to cause economic chaos for the user base is irresponsible.
You are also misdirecting or misinterpreting my "4 weeks" reference. Read it again. As I said (in fact agreeing with your sentiment) Gavin explicitly wanted to have a serious lead time (a year or so) so that there would be adequate time for code/test/rollout. I posed a hypothetical - if things broke in 4 weeks from now, would you be happy? I am not suggesting that things will break in 4 weeks (though they could), I am asking if you think that leaving the user base vulnerable to this is likely to be judged 'professional' - I do not.
As for a sad joke? I have 4 decades of successful production level design/code/test/rollout in large banking and Telco roles (24x7 stuff ) - my public profile is quite visible. Yet I am being told by 'talented amateurs' that *they know better* - even though for many, Bitcoin is their first live, large scale, 24x7 project. Some of them have zero other commercial experience!
@_date: 2016-03-09 06:34:27
Interesting idea, but I doubt it would work out like that.
Gold has that role - because of &gt;6000 years history of being used for commerce. It is *still* used to settle international trade between nations, and in the far east it is still used by billions of people as currency.
That widespread usage is what gives gold its pre-eminent position as store of value. Bitcoin has better attributes than gold in some respects, but unless it also gains widespread acceptance in general trade usage (IE backed by lots of real economics) it will not get the kind of exchange rates you are implying.
Only very high level of exchange rates would justify high Tx fees.
A more likely result is that Bitcoin would just lose the mind share it currently has - and the exchange rate pricing with it. That would be death.
It needs to grow the user base dramatically if it is going to remain the premier crypto currency. For the moment that means ensuring the Tx fees are low.

I suspect you are underestimating how big the pool is of talented developers who are not part of the core dev clique.
That, plus the nature of open source, implies that any meaningful improvement created by the core devs on a break away chain, will simply be ported to to 'classic' if there is commercial pressure for it.
The existing BTC ledger will continue on regardless.
I would agree with you that the social engineering and assorted corrupt tactics will continue. Along with that, we can expect a crash  of confidence (and price) if the very predictable capacity crunch occurs. However, there are already off the shelf answers - XT, Unlimited, Classic - so that crash will only be brief.
The integer wrap bug only took about 24 hours to run cycle of total crash of price, through recovery. Since the capacity issue is much better understood, any price crash driven by this is likely to be much less severe, and recover very very quickly.

Classic solution to that is simply locate your development work in a well connected data centre and remote connect to work on it.

FYI - at least one bank (mine), with multi-currency accounts, allows you to move the same currency between countries for zero cost.... 
So ... you can use ANXpro.com to get good spot rates for BTC/GPB and transfers to them of GBP happens to be free as well.  They use the same bank.
This highlights the fact that some people (including me) get many good services from the established banks.  Where they really gouge everyone, is with very poor retail foreign exchange rates.
You can eliminate bad exchange rates without using Bitcoin by using a specialized currency trader - and I have done that too....  but that only works well for large amounts, so it is not applicable to typical remittances.
Small value transfers (like most remittances are) is where using Bitcoin as the transfer approach, really wins out.
No need to use Localbitcoins.... though I have in the past.

The tech partial solution (which hurts decentralisation by creating choke points) would be to provide a tunnelling end point capability, that people could connect to (Client through single or double NAT to tunnel server) and allow other bitcoin nodes to request a tunnel to be opened to any client connected  to the tunnel server.  Ugly and with security issues (vulnerable to traffic analysis).... but you could wrap the setup process into some simple app or script to make it newbie friendly.
You then end up with hub and spoke stuff with the tunnel controller as a hub for a group of nodes located in lousy ISP places.  As long as you have lots of tunnel hubs running and the whole thing is permissionless there is probably an advantage over just being parasite nodes as they currently are. Mainly because the disadvantaged nodes become contactable and can source the blockchain.  Not much advantage though.
The tunnel controller does not need to handle the actual traffic. It simply forwards a contact request to the hidden (Client type) node. That node then connects (outbound) to the other node that would normally do an inbound connect, and then as normal re-broadcasts whatever is required. This is the same sort of technique that Skype and others use to pierce NAT and firewalls.

Segwit has some laudable goals  ... but there are some arguments against the soft fork strategy chosen. A hard fork approach to SegWit would allow a reduction in [Technical Debt]( rather than an increase.
On top of that, the same goals (plus some extra benefits) can be achieved with a different design as long as you opt for a hard fork.
There is a written, worked and tested alternate proposal  by Tom Zander (and others are possible) ... see [Flexible Transactions](
Tom's proposal now has a BIP assigned, so as with many things in life, design of Bitcoin improvements has a variety of ways to achieve things. There are often no clear cut 'best' choices.
If the market rejects SegWit, there are other solutions to Tx throughput, supporting L2 solutions and improving other areas of performance in the system.

I suspect the predictable and immutable attributes the market values are:
* maximum number of coins fixed at 21M
* coin minting schedule fixed
* transactions irreversible and permanently recorded
Other attributes like limited Tx capacity are technical rather than economic parameters that limit rather than facilitate general usage .... and really should be improved/changed whenever possible. The Core devs spend lots of effort trying to improve technical issues. I dispute some of the priorities they apply, but not their intent, technical prowess or the fact that they want to improve things.
ALL forks have risk. Some very desirable design changes can only be achieved with a hard fork.
Reducing the risk of any fork (hard or soft) is mostly achieved by planning and communicating the change a long way in advance.
It is foolish to arbitrarily restrict your design choices (no hard forks which you suggest) if you want the best possible improvements to the system.
FYI - soft forks seem to be the best choice, but that is a bit simplistic as most people underestimate the increased complexity that they inevitably bring. They almost always *increase* the [Technical Debt]( of a system. Hard forks,often *reduce* Technical debt.




This is wrong - hard forks do not mean the currency aspects of a blockchain have been altered and do hence do not mean it is an unpredictable currency.  Soft forks could be used to damage the currency parameters just as much as hard forks.
It is whether or not the currency parameters are altered that controls the system being a predictable currency. - not hard v/s soft forks.

We have had 'Secure and cheap' - and 'fast' is a relative term. About 5 to 10 minutes (and seconds for 0-conf) was fine.
Now - with the capacity crunch finally starting to bite consistently, we are losing 'cheap' and 'fast enough'
The introduction of full RBF crashed the 'Secure' part of 0-conf transactions too.
So now we have
 
* getting slower
* getting dearer
* not as secure as it used to be in some circumstances (0-conf)

As I said - FT is a much better design approach than having 'blobs' of unknown data floating around with a 'trust me' flag to gain extensibility. 
I have not checked (must put on my TODO) but has the 'witness blob' got a consistent version flag with a fixed internal format? or the FT style tag/data format?
Increased capacity as a goal is not contentious. The ramifications of whichever design approach ends up being in use, may be.
Even SegWit increases the requirements of a full node. If Bitcoin is to grow it will inevitably end up beyond the network limits of the more restricted areas of the Internet. It already is unworkable for a full node with some connection technologies. For businesses in those geographies who need the data integrity of their own full node, they can always VPN into a hosted node in a better connected location.

NOT TRUE,  Some possibility for change was always embodied in the Bitcoin design - right down at the protocol level.
The fact that Satoshi included a version number in the layout of transactions (from day 1) show that he expected managed change in the protocol. Using a version number is the classic software design technique to support such changes,
Soft/Hard forks - ones that do not bump the version number, are kludges because they do not use the normal mechanism for dealing with version changes in the protocol... the version number in every packet.
So far,  that is all the kind of change we have had ... kludges.

That is utterly true. And lots of people (including me) have been pointing out this impending, predictable problem for years. 
The primary complaint has been about the lack of forward planning for avoiding this predictable problem. It would not have hurt to have 'planned' for a block size limit increase  (or something better?) 3 years back, with a 3 year lead time. A long lead time is pretty much the only way to minimise the chain split risk of a hard fork.
That approach could also have been subject cancellation/revision if problems were found or a better solution.
Unfortunately, we have lost that opportunity. So now we are left with a mess, and much higher risk than was needed. In the longer time frame (years) this will be sorted out, but it does let  you identify key players who, for all their other acknowledged skills, have done some very poor planning regards capacity.
Planning matters !

0.13.1 is not necessarily active SegWit support. You have to turn it on in the config as well as run 0.13.1.  It does mean *SegWit ready*
@_date: 2016-11-05 15:17:17
Nodes (all flavours) should have an optional (and default) number of blocks before they drop a 0-conf transaction.  144 blocks since the Tx arrived would be about 1 day.
Why? Because it would make the user interaction predictable ... IE .... wait 1 day and your funds come back to you if they are unconfirmed (not in a block)
Making that a config option with a sane default should be very uncontroversial.
If your wanted some other timeout, you could run your own node or use a node with a setting that you like - nodes could (optionally) publicise their timeout setting.

It is better in two ways - it reduces technical debt, and removes the need for hard forks in many future situations by building future extensibility
and worse in one way - it requires a hard fork - but only once to remove much of the need for future hard forks.
You could also do SegWit as well (though doing both is a pretty poor idea). They are not mutually exclusive. They just address many of the same goals.

Oops - please read a bit more. There are two stages need to get an effective block size increase from SegWit
* Activation
* Widespread uptake
The first item could happen soon, though maybe not.
The second will take **quite a while**, so there is no real relief in sight for the capacity crunch the system is now suffering.

@_date: 2016-12-06 05:23:36
Increasing from 1M blocks does not centralise **provided** that any increase is limited to the increase in available bandwidth and CPU resources (due to improved technology) needed to handle a larger block size. That is a delicate balancing act that has not been worked out.
@_date: 2016-12-09 10:31:43
It is only an increase for people who choose to use it. Personally, even if SegWit activates soon, I will avoid using it for quite a while.
Why? It is new code/design. It is almost inevitable that despite good testing and thorough review there will still be a few wrinkles to work out, and I prefer not to take the risk of being a guinea pig. Particularly with SPV wallet support which almost certainly lags the Core code in testing.

You seem to have some fixation on Mike Hearn - I did not mention him.
Since you mention Satoshi, you may wish to remember that he specifically laid out pseudo code to increase the block size limit (capacity constraint), which implied both a hard fork and a decent lead time for that fork.
Do you support his viewpoint on that?
@_date: 2016-12-26 08:19:40
Full blocks are a barrier for some use cases.... and until there are layer 2 systems widely deployed this limits the *rate of uptake* for Bitcoin (growth).  It does not stop the growth.
One other use case it broke for me (and a few others that I notice have commented) was the educational use case.
I no longer try to explain Bitcoin to people I meet - the simple demo of giving someone a tiny amount of money ... phone to phone ... is wrecked by the fee market and the unpredictable time to get confirmed in a block.  Full RBF broke the trust in 0-conf .... so all round I have given up introducing Bitcoin in it's current form. Later maybe, but not at the moment.
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:00:28
Full RBF breaks any trust in 0-conf. That in turn destroys the semi-instant low value transfers where it was worth risking the interval before a Tx gets recorded in a block.
The current problem is a lack of capacity to support the real requirements of a very modest sized user community. There is no way to provide unlimited capacity, but there are no good technical arguments against a modest increase in allowed block size. SegWit for example if widely used will use about double the network bandwidth currently needed, so the (simpler) alternative of relaxing the limit would provide an instant, rather than slowly rolled out, upgrade.
The core developers have never given a good reason for ignoring the KISS principal in raw capacity increase, to give time for 2nd level truly scalable solutions like Lightning to mature and be deployed.
@_date: 2016-12-19 05:06:54
If we see a hard fork that succeeds in delivering a major increase in Tx capacity we could just as easily see the price explode upwards.
@_date: 2016-12-07 10:08:49
All forks have some dangers. Some desirable design changes can only be achieved by hard forks.
Reducing the risks of all forks is very important, and the best way to achieve that is to plan and publicise the impending fork (hard or soft) a long way in advance.

SegWit partially fixes malleablity. 100% fixed for SegWit format transactions. No fix for original format transactions (which are still supported).
It would take a hard fork approach to fix old format transactions. Soft forks can sneak in some changes, but hard forks will be needed sometimes to properly fix some problems. The art is to de-risk whatever a hard fork changes ... by planning the change a **long** way in advance - a few releases of software at least.
SegWit would achieve more if it had been planned as a hard fork, but that was not the decision that Core took, and there is no longer enough lead time available to reconsider that choice. So - soft fork it is for SegWit;

Hard forks are not to be avoided if the benefit they achieve outweighs their risks.
AND reducing that risk is pretty easy - announce them well in advance... it is called planning.
As you say, SegWit as a hard fork would get the extra benefit of reducing technical debt - but that is not what is on offer. So my point stands in the current comparison.
The second advantage of eliminating the need for more hard forks in a lot of future changes is very valuable. SegWit does not do that - even with a hard fork. So with a hard fork, it does have an advantage over SegWit.
@_date: 2016-12-22 09:45:19


I do not support anyone as dictator of Bitcoin ... where do you get that from. Mike Hearn correctly forecast the capacity issues we are now experiencing. He was not alone in that. Supporting his now proven accurate forecast of impending problems is not the same as suggesting I want him or anyone else to be 'dictator of Bitcoin .... you are misrepresenting me by saying that.


Ok - we agree on that. How about core dispels the 'hard fork is bad' sentiment too.  Hard forks will *sometimes* be essential, and the risk aspect is managed exactly as Satoshi suggested by planning them a **long** way in advance (plus code/test etc of course)
The public needs to be educated to that requirement of careful hard forks being sometimes (very rarely) necessary, and just as importantly what should never be changed by any hard or soft fork - the economic parameters.
SegWit would have been a much better change as a hard fork and there was enough lead time to do it that way. A missed opportunity that means SegWit is less effective than it could have been.
@_date: 2016-11-26 13:21:05
You can revise the version 2 Tx formats (FT) in any way you like without needing a hard fork. SegWit does not allow that - even if you implement SegWit with a hard fork. Version 1 Tx format changes always need a hard fork.
This is pretty much the whole point of Flexible Transactions - and why it is called that. Being able to achieve the same goals as SegWit is just a side effect of being a better approach to handling transaction requirement changes.


I strongly disagree. And ETH did a lousy job of forward planning for a socially contentious change because they had very little time to deal with the issue.
By planning, I mean a couple of (normal) releases of software in advance.
I do not think the goal of having more capacity in the Bitcoin system is in any way socially contentious (though there may be a strange minority that want Bitcoin to remain a tiny tech toy?)
Unfortunately Bitcoin Core and the rest have frittered away that long lead time in designing their solution to a capacity increase
Eg. They could simply have said SegWit will require a hard fork when the feature was accepted into the roadmap. It was far enough in advance that we would not have any risk of a chain split. That would also have gained a goal of reducing rather than increasing the technical debt.... which is a very good idea.
And some very good feature changes can only be done with a hard fork. Never rule out any of your choices or strategies.
Eg ... you normally do not use dynamite (too dangerous), but there are circumstances where it is the only choice if you want to achieve your goal. You just need to be sure you are managing the risk.

See throwaway36245 comment.  Tx mallebaility is not fixed for old format Tx by SegWit.
@_date: 2016-12-08 13:30:32


There are endless reddit and forum debates about the two terms and a variety of other ones now - like 'firm fork' .... all just blah. 
Forks are forks - with risks to be managed.


There are some well documented risks with SegWit - mainly the 'this Tx is all fine' approach. Those risks are mitigated by demanding a 95% miner acceptance threshold, which may not happen. If that threshold is reduced in future to (say) 70% just to get it activated, those documented risks get much more likely.
Personally I plan to ignore SegWit style transactions for quite a while. Let someone else be the pioneer and get shot by the bugs that crop up.


I did not say 'fully' tested - I did say tested. Even Tom has openly said the proposal will benefit from peer review and more testing. That is pretty much the point of getting it assigned a BIP.


No difference to SegWit with that - except that the new format Tx is adjustable in a way that is transparent to wallets using it if it gets enhanced later.


I need to look at that again, but you could be right about the sequence numbers - I do not like removing data either. The BIP can be revised if that is true, it is just one more tag/data item anyway.
One major advantage I see is that FT just directly uses normal Bitcoin addresses - not things hidden inside the '3.....' script processing. That is totally compatible with the oldest outputs in the system. You can use them with the version 1 format - with all its problems, or with the version 2 format with malleability fixed... in that aspect it is far less complex than SegWit.
@_date: 2016-12-08 12:45:14
You do not sound like you have done a lot of systems development. Hard/soft is an arbitrary term. Both approaches have risk - and you deal with the risks by planning and testing far enough advance.
Zanders proposal is not yet fully tested - but that is normal for developments. I find the proposal elegant, not ugly, so I guess that one is subjective. It uses a well known and widely used technique of tag/data to provide extensibility - not the hidden blob approach of SegWit. Much better for future maintenance of the protocol.
It also directly supports many types of future enhancements without the need for any further forks. A very valuable attribute. As far as removing some things - yes - the buggy bits like Tx malleability. That is a good thing.

Many other protocols do exactly that - TCP/IP as a rather pointed example.
Producing a decent written specification rather than just having a reference codebase is the missing step.
I do remember when TCP/IP was new, and the various implementations of it had problems. A competitive market soon sorted out which versions you could trust, and  that was before the rise of social media. In todays world, people would *very* quickly weed out bad developers and their offerings.
FYI ... from your previous comment.... one thing I forgot to highlight. 


You can not fix a capacity issue with a fee market. Imposing a fee market with an artificial constraint on capacity is central planning to strangle the growth of a commercial activity.
@_date: 2016-12-08 05:36:54
There are other solutions that work just fine with big blocks. The problem is the number of Tx inputs for  given transactions. So adding a limit for that number, rather than the block size allows larger blocks, but prevents the CPU issues for scaling the hash testing.
A limit on the number of Tx inputs would only affect a tiny percentage of transactions, and has a simple procedural workaround for end users that are affected. Specifically do 2 or more transactions with a smaller number of inputs so that your transactions (individually) comply with the limit. Wallets could even do this transparently if you want.
@_date: 2016-12-05 09:56:47
Satoshi himself altered the consensus rules - he installed the 1MB limit as a change to the original rules.

I have recently noticed that the trend to mining centralisation seems to have reversed.
Look at this list: 
I suspect that the technology race (CP, then GPU, then FPGA, then ASIC) has basically run its course, and now you are getting a level of commercial competition instead.
People with resources trying to establish key positions in Bitcoin as one of the new global currencies. That may even include state actors as part of the ongoing wider currency wars that are happening.
At any rate, lots of people have realised that Bitcoin is not going away, and many different wealthy players are starting to take positions. This probably limits mining to the infamous 1%, but that will be very competitive and definitely not centralised going forward.

Confirmation times is an interesting issue. It is sort of basic to the original Bitcoin design and I doubt it can ever be changed.
As a result, the behaviour of a Tx while it has 0-conf becomes fairly important.
At present, because RBF has been introduced 0-conf is not something you can depend on.
Worse, the behaviour of the system when a Tx is stuck in the mempool is undefined. It may linger for 2 hours or 2 months. Unpredictable user interactions are deadly to confidence that people have.
One thing that could be done is to set an explicit policy about 0-conf transactions and how you can expect them to behave.
* Automatically get dropped after a known interval (say 144 block=1 day)
* or automatically re-broadcast indefinitely so you know that eventually they will get into a block
No one seems to be working on this aspect of the system.

I am behind a NAT - but I control the router and it has a public facing IP address. If you are behind a double NAT as some ISP's use, you are screwed. (if you do not control your on premises router you are screwed too)
Eg. Some ISP's use a large 10.x.x.x address space which is NAT'ed behind their real (Internet) IP addresses, and then for the customer equipment, it gets a single 10.x.x.x address and the customer router NAT's that into a 192.168.0.x LAN in their home.

The counter to that tiny competitive issue, is that there are an unknown number of transactions that are now regularly **dropped** by the system because of the mempool backlog.
With larger blocks, those transactions would not be dropped and would add to the transaction fees collected by miners. We do not have the statistics to measure either outcome and predict the effect on any given miners income. It is entirely possible that your 49% miner would end up with a neutral income result and that the 51% group would simply have a larger income.
On top of that, the end user community would be spared the immense frustration that backlogged transactions cause.
And the 49% miners can always adjust their connectivity to address the competitive problem.  That would be the free market approach where failures of some inefficient players is expected and needed.
Before you say that failing miners leads to centralisation, you should consider the current evidence that the centralisation trend now seems to be reversing.
See my comment [here]( for the observation and reference. I am not the only person who has notice this trend change and it removes many worries that the core devs have expressed about mining centralisation. Now all that needs to happen is to fix the development centralisation problem.

We have an impasse, and a pending capacity problem.
I am in the camp that says an bigger limit *now* is safer than a bigger limit when the utilisation needs it urgently. That is one of the basics of capacity planning - try to keep technical changes off the critical path. I am less concerned about the solution chosen.
3 of the holders of the github keys do not accept the need to solve this issue promptly. They probably do not have the appropriate experience to understand why this is a critical issue, and they have been intransigent in the face of well reasoned argument, without offering any concrete alternate solution, and without [recusing themselves]( from the decision about this issue - on the grounds of either insufficient relevant knowledge, or conflict of interest (Blockstream?)
So - we just get the messy approach we now have. 
If BitcoinXT does become the dominant client, then for branding reasons it would be desirable for Bitcoin core to just apply the BIP101 patch and get on with it. In which case, Gavin should still hold the guthib keys and perhaps the other 3 should resign in the face of decision by the wider world. That decision would indicate that their expertise does not reflect the community view.
We will see the outcome of this over the next few (or more) months.

Luke, you keep asserting that it is all nodes that determine consensus... I am very sure the it is *only* the miners that determine the longest valid chain in one key way.
I do understand the economic power that the whole community wields, but that always responds in a lagging way, to the rules enforced at a technical level. Ie... if you hate something that changed, you can cease using Bitcoin and that is the ultimate sanction to hold miners to account.
However ... just at the technical level. 
You have miners and non miners (validating nodes).
Sure - a massive majority of non mining nodes may want to insist on something (like just continuing with the status quo), but if a majority or especially a supermajority of miners decides otherwise, how will non miners influence that choice? Not in any technical manner, only via economic pressure, which acts slowly.
Take the edge case so see this at the extreme .... say 100% of miners follow BIP101 ... and all the non miners do not. In that case you have fork underway, and the BIP101 fork is operating normally - blocks every 10m and so on. As soon as a &gt;1Mb gets added, all the non-miners will reject all the blocks from then on - and from their perspective, their fork has died. Stopped. No new blocks, and not transactions recorded that they can see.
Even with 100% of the non-miners wanting to ignore BIP101, if the miners go with it the economic pressure builds on both groups, but the non-miners have no technical way to force the miners to change.
Then look at the reverse edge case.  100% of the non miners **want  BIP101** - and all the miners do not.  There is not a thing that non miner nodes can do except to try to pressure them with reasoning and arguments.
Every single non miner could change their node to implement BIP101 - and if the miners do not agree - tough - it just does not happen,
See what I mean? At technical and operational level, the miners have a veto and/or can force a change, that can only be overruled slowly by wider economic action of the rest of the users. And frankly, getting the wider group to agree on anything is improbable unless there is a visible outage.

You are free to do that work (compiling) .... It would be a useful service to provide, and I suspect Mike would that ... he does offer exactly that branch of source code.
Luke-jr has withdrawn the 'xt' optional support that he used to provide for Gentoo users - with no notification, so it becomes a silent retraction if you were relying on that.
I raised a bug when I noticed: 
and Luke kindly confirmed the change - he is the maintainer, so he is entitled to remove support, but it is poor etiquette to slide one past the people relying in a neutral stance from a maintainer,
You can see from that bug report, I will be doing the work needed to supply BitcoinXT to Gentoo users - I do not really want the work, but the censorship of what is only an alternate client (unless it get majority support), is worth pushing back against.

In your original statement, you did not restrict your blanket 'Nothing ...ever' Since for Von Neumann architecture machines (and that is all we really have) that is wrong, the whole blanket statement is wrong.
Even if we had other systems where moving data to RAM was not needed, saying 'Nothing ... ever' is still wrong, because it is untrue for the Von N systems.

I am saying you will be fine. Because... the 75% chain will definitely win, for the very direct ways that the forked chains will behave under different hashing support. People overlook the effect of the difficulty level - set to suit 400 P/hash at the moment, then suddenly being mined by 100 P/hash and 300 P/hash on the 25% and 75% chains respectively.
The pressure to switch to the 75% chain will be immense, and almost instant.
The 25% fork remains functionally crippled for weeks even if it retains the support of those miners. I would wager that the non miners would jump ship to the XT side within a week. Miner too as soon as they recognize that the fork has occurred.
Still .... an ugly outcome as you say... but very possible.
People need to remember that the major mining groups have all accepted the need for some increase. There remains the discussion or which strategy (BIP100, 101 etc)... and the chinese in particular seem reluctant to show which solution they like.
Because I am highly risk averse (I learnt to fly - instrument level - it makes you very careful), I want an implementation earlier rather than later, to leave the maximum amount of time to fix the inevitable hurdles that will show up.

Removing the **hard limit** would open up Bitcoin to a better capacity which will hopefully be needed soon. 
That will not make it die.
What is almost certain to happen if the hard limit is lifted, is that individual miners will set a *soft limit* to suit their particular situation. That too would a good thing - effectively a free market competition between miners about the optimum size, with the flexibility to adjust that without risking another hard fork.
Personally I agree with [this]( sentiment.

I answered your 100% thought experiment in a post earlier. It is a good thought experiment because it boundary tests the issue. At lower percentages the effects are less obvious .. but still follow the logic of the boundary case.
Your conclusion is wrong in the case where the miners alter what is essentially a minor internal technical issue. The economic majority just does not care. If the miners tried a change to the basic economic settings (like 21M), you might get the response you describe - but the odds of getting a majority hash power behind such a controversial idea are very very low.
Using your 100% edge case. If miners go 100% XT ... then all the nodes using the rules of Bitcoin Core have a dead chain - no new blocks are being added that follow the old rules.
Who loses out then? Any normal user who switches to XT has a functioning environment that respects all the prior Bitcoin history. Any one who does not switch has a dead system ... The miners will rapidly have people who switch to the XT rules, just to preserve their prior investments. Miners **will** be able to sell their coins. People sticking to ;core' will not - they will not even be able to move them from wallet to wallet.
Under 100% uptake by miners has a similar result...
Thought experiment 75/25 split... the 25% chain (core) gets blocks about every 40 minutes, the 75% chain (XT) gets blocks about every 13.3 minutes - which one is more functional? And the XT chain will adjust the difficulty back to 10 minutes blocks much more rapidly than the Core chain, but the adjustment will take months at least.

Since it is not an objective criteria, and as a result is not measurable, how can you be suggesting numbers like 99.9% update before you accept that the revised set of consensus rules is Bitcoin rather than an altcoin.  
All the economic level indicators of usage are sloppy and imprecise, yet you seem to say we must have 99.9% uptake (unmeasurable) before **you** will accept things have changed. Effectively, you are saying you will only accept the status quo, unless the world has moved on without you.
One thing you do identify well, is that using a hard fork based such as XT, will be in effect an internal economic war. But economics is fundamentally competitive in nature. Obviously gaining wide acceptance reduces possible collateral damage which is desirable. However, sometimes in life it becomes clear that there is not going to be that acceptance, but that the status quo is also unacceptable to a sizeable group of people. At that point, there will be conflict ... and that is where we seem to be at the moment.
* The 1Mb limit is not sustainable indefinitely - change must happen - total agreement on that
* some people want to wait until we start having capacity issues before changing it - defer but increase the change impact risk
* some people want to change the limit now, to ensure the change is not a critical path item - take the risk now, but with lots of time to handle unexpected complications.
By the way, your *experts* are effectively self appointed - and in large part by timing, personal interest - the historical luck of being involved from the early days.
I think you are underestimating how many other *experts* exist. People who have the background skill sets, and with the arrival of VC money and banks, who now have motivation to apply their skills.
These are people who are not associated with Bitcoin core - and they bring a raft of other experience to the table that a lot of the initial developers do not have.
Your suggestion that two-thirds of experts oppose the change is unlikely to be an accurate assessment if you do not also canvas all the people now reviewing Bitcoin. And that is impossible.
You just can not know what the overall viewpoint is ... nor can I or anyone else.

As correctly pointed out to me, every participant in the Bitcoin network is a 'node'.
I was incorrect in thinking SPV endpoints were not 'nodes' .... they are - but they  do not carry out two of the three functions that underly Bitcoin ... they do not validate the block chain, and they do not carry out mining.
The node count, that you get from  shows the list of nodes that verify the block chain and are public about it.  That group may be decreasing in number, and the number of mining nodes (not hashing points) has decreased as well. But overall, the number of network participants is rising, and because Bitcoin is *permissionless* anyone that has centralisation concerns, can start doing the validation/mining function themselves.
This shift in behaviour means that a level of trust has been introduced into the system that was not there at the start, when every node was mining, validating and perhaps inserting transactions.
We are trusting, not individual third parties, but a system of third parties to provide those two functions, mining and chain validation, with the get out clause that anyone can do those things for themselves too, if they like.
System wise, we are trusting that enough people will operate those functions, and because of the dispersed nature of their systems, we will be sufficiently immune to external manipulation.
Centralization would be an impossible problem if Bitcoin was not permissionless. It remains an issue to monitor, but not to panic over.
@_date: 2015-08-01 06:21:36
EDIT 3 - deliberately replying to myself.
One way to look at Visa, is that they run *two* processes. 
* Initial transaction capture
* backend transaction settlement
The Bitcoin equivalent is:
* Initial transaction capture - 0-conf
* backend transaction settlement - commit Tx into the blockchain
Bitcoin does MUCH better on the second phase, but Visa does not lose data from the Initial Tx capture ... Bitcoin does - transactions expire.
If Bitcoin changes to mimic the Visa approach, then just like Visa, users will ignore the 'settlement time' - and block production rates become far less important.  I mean, who cares if the settlement takes 10 minutes or 20 hours for a nice painting, if you almost instantly (0-conf) are sure the Tx will never be lost. (not yet on the blockchain, but not going to be lost)
An advantage of adding data integrity to the transaction capture process, is that only that process needs capacity planning to deal with *peak loads*. The backend settlement process then becomes time insensitive to a large degree. That part would then only need to deal with *average load* - which is what Luke is contending.
Transaction capture data integrity is a local issue for a network participant - and as a result presents **no network wide scaling issues**.
Perhaps Luke and I have been talking past each other. Luke has been referring to the capacity needs of the settlement process, and I am concerned about the capacity needs of the transaction capture process... which if it is forced to depend on the data integrity of the settlement process rather than the capture process, shifts its peak load issues onto the settlement process.
A possible trust issue - but not really.
If *only the sender* is responsible for data integrity of transaction capture... (rebroadcasting a Tx to ensure that some miner will include it in a block) ... then the customer/merchant scenario (or me paying a friend) can be gamed.
However, if we encourage (but do not require) network participants, particularly validating nodes and miners, to also rebroadcast pending transactions, then you only need one party in the entire network, (other than the sender) to do this, and then you have removed the ability of the sender to game the system. 
Clearly for merchants, they have an incentive to do exactly this. Once they see a 0-conf transaction at their node/wallet, if their wallets ensures that it never expires .... they get paid.. eventually.  If random other nodes/wallets do too ... fine. No damage.
It should be pretty easy to do this in Core. No changes to the protocol, just the behaviour on a local level. Getting agreement to change Core this way would be influential enough to get the same behaviour on a more widespread basis, and not every one needs to support this behaviour to make it implemented.
Combined with vetting transactions (before input) for the fee being 'reasonable', this should move the capacity issue out by a few years.
There is a current risk, that any one node can simply force non expiring transactions (as a design change) on everyone .... simply by running a node (or a few for resilience reasons) that ensures that every 0-conf entry in its local mempool is persistent (rebroadcast at some interval).
If they did that, and publicized that 0-conf transactions have become reliable as a result ... that would be that. Network wide change implemented - with or without the agreement of the core developers. No consensus required for this change to be effective because it only applies to the transaction capture process.
@_date: 2015-08-19 08:36:37
Fee market is a market... but does not in any way correct a fundamental capacity limit. They are separate issues.
The main competitor in the retail payment space (Visa), has set, hidden fees, and just increases capacity to allow for any massive load spikes.
Even though most of us do not like that approach, it does function very well from the end user perspective, as far as performance goes.
On that front, introducing user selected fees, will confuse many people (unfortunately), and arbitrarily dropping transactions after an unpredictable interval when the network is under load, is catastrophic for user perceptions.
The second problem can be resolved by either improving the data integrity of the transaction input phase (0-conf) or by ensuring there is always excess capacity in the blocks that are sweeping up the pending transactions.
Preferably, we should do both.
 
The only problem with all the alternatives that are 'in the works' is just that - they are not code, that we can experiment with and come to objective conclusions about. BIP101 is the only alternative that we can test at present.
I doubt that the idea of staying limited to 1Mb blocks forever has much support. The issue is more about how much increase in capacity is sensible, and when and how should a capacity solution be implemented.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:28:01
But that is very similar to what some of the core developers did with the P2SH fork ... and they did not leave  the -core project.
Remember that 2 of the 5 people who control the github repository are in favour of increasing the block limit right now.  So that means there is a serious minority view in favour of change.
Even the 3 who oppose the idea of it being an urgent change, do acknowledge the need to increase the limit at some (undefined) point in the future.
When you end up with an impasse, and have used years of polite persuasion, you only have the tactic of widening the debate.
That process has highlighted that a number influential people (in particular) are prepared to use censorship and probably any other technique that comes to mind, to steer the debate to towards their view point.
That alone suggest they have no confidence in the logical power of their arguments.  Since the ones with the github keys, plus with control of and BCT, have a voice on the dominant code and media platforms (strongly associated with the Bitcoin brand), and seem to be intransigent, they can only be countered with the usual political techniques.
Gavin and Mike have not marshalled those techniques without previously spending years of negotiation. Now we get a more public dispute.

BitcoinXT is an alt-client ... if there is a conflict of interest in points of control - sad - this is real life.

Please read point 4 (page 3) [here](
See the diagram where each block references the previous hash ... 
So the small block node will ignore a big block, and then any subsequent small block that references that big block in its chain. - the hashes are wrong.
The big block node will accept the big block and all other blocks that are mined by a miner allowing big blocks, and reject any small blocks mined by miners only allowing small blocks. - the hashes are wrong.
Your node only gets to follow one chain, and as soon as you accept/reject that first big block, the choice is made. If everyone is using the same validation rules, blocks do get reworked as later 'longer chain' information arrives, but in this case the difference is in the validation rules, and not just the resolution of propagation delay induced forks.
So you get a race, between the mining nodes - and with the planned BIP101, the 75% (big block) group will be producing blocks much faster.
One of these chains will end up being the discarded set of validation rules ... left behind by economic pressure of the non miners.
The users following the small block chain, will also suddenly have a bad user experience. Block production drops to about every 40 minutes until the next difficulty adjustment. (Ie. about 1/4 of the max capacity we currently have). This means all the 1Mb blocks will be full continuously until the difficulty level gets adjusted downwards to cope with the reduced mining power on the small chain.  Best estimate is between 4 and 9 weeks ... so at least a month of bad user experience for non miners following the small chain (Bitcoin core)
A brutal process. Any miner who chooses the losing chain, looses any coinbase rewards obtained during that interval. The quickest way for a miner to improve the probability of not losing those rewards, is to "*throw in the towel*" and support BIP101 which at the time the fork is triggered, already has 75% of the mining power behind it. Doing that is within their own control, trying to guess what exchanges and end users will do is not under their control.
So what will exchanges and end users do (fairly quickly?), if it becomes obvious that a huge majority of miners are following BIP101 ?? They have little option other than changing too. Ok, people could really resist that ... but there is very little reward for sticking with the shorter chain, and instant improvement in the user experience if they too shift to BIP101 compliant software.
As you say - safety first.
Technically illiterate users are still users. If they see that their Bitcoin experience now sucks, and some one suggests that they need to upgrade to return to good performance, they will do it.
Most people have been conditioned by Microsoft, Apple and Google to take upgrades to software. The simplistic perception if BIP101 is triggered, is likely to be that 'you need to take an upgrade' to fix the slow response you are getting.

One thing  wrong in that article is the description:
"BigBlock-Users (users who pay transaction fees, but do not run nodes) to SmallBlock-Users (those who run full nodes, but do not pay transaction fees)"
Anyone submitting a transaction selects the fee level to use (as long as the wallet software they use lets them).
And at the moment, all wallets are nodes - non validating (SPV), or validating. They are all 'nodes' in that they communicate transactions in the P2P network to each/any other node.

You are confusing two separate items.
We rely on the miners to enforce the technical components of the Bitcoin protocol. They are only section of users that ADDs blocks to the chain.
That gives them explicit power that other users can only override by the indirect economic power they have.
The miners can act very quickly.  Other users can, if they agree, follow the miners quickly, or abandon Bitcoin.
If 100% of miners are mining something that respects the Bitcoin block chain of the past, all the way up to the hard fork point, and they are not implementing some radical change to the economic settings in Bitcoin, then for all other users, they either follow the 'new' Bitcoin protocol rules, or they suffer the economic fallout. The miners would be impacted too, but non miners get hit first. They can not make transactions until they switch to the view of the protocol enforced by the miners.
If 100% of miners switch, the block chain that the old rules respect is not getting any NEW blocks ... it is dead for user transactions.  That takes effect instantly.
Take the explicit example of an exchange... and use your 100% scenario. Users can not withdraw BTC (no blocks following the old rules) unless the exchange switches to the revised protocol... instant pressure to do so. Either the exchange changes or its business is dead in the water instantly. What do you think they will do?
So ... that 'altcoin' the miners are producing?  Is it an altcoin if the original is not functioning any more, but it carries forward all the 13M coin history of Bitcoin.
I do not think so.

Sure, anyone can submit code changes, and lots of people do. But only the core team can pull that work into the repository.
THAT gives those individuals a privileged position, and they are using it to prevent any solution to increasing the 1Mb limit being applied to the main repository.

The core guys with the commit keys could accept that a fairly large number of people want some increase now. As much to prove that the developers are responsive to the community as any other underlying reason.
Those against BIP101 could create clone of it that starts with an increase to 2Mb and a formula (simple formula please) to increase the limit on a planned schedule.
A 2Mb limit would not hurt anyone - and would shift any capacity issues out into future by a year or two. It would also effectively kill BIP101.  If Gavin and Mike object to what would be essentially a more conservative version of their own proposal, that would be rather telling.
Equally, if those opposed to BIP101 do not present a credible plan for a capacity increase in the basic Bitcoin environment, that would be rather telling too.
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:12:14
Miners do not have ultimate control, but they do have immediate control of what protocol details are being enforced. Eg block size limit.
Only the miners ADD to the block chain. Other nodes are free to validate according to whichever rules they like... but even if every non-mining node sticks to bitcoin core, if the miners mover to XT ... either the rest of us start mining, or we follow the miners. Following the miners is a lot easier.
Whilst the users have ultimate economic control, what the miners enforce at a protocol level is vital. In such a minor technical issues as block size limit, the wishes of a bunch of prima donna developers is less relevant. They are replaceable. Perhaps not easily, but definitely replaceable. The majority of the miners have publicly supported a hard fork to support more capacity. It will happen if they choose to do so.
Most end users, exchanges etc ... seem to like that idea too. The core devs obstructing a speedy resolution are doing a disservice .... and censorship is now an extra black mark.
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:58:18
I agree that confusion is very possible with the 75% supermajority, but some number needed to be chosen.... and for non miners, that is a huge incentive to switch immediately to XT.
Why? Risk aversion
* if the fork never happens - you are fine
* if the fork does happen - you are fine.
As a non miner, sticking with Bitcoin core exposes you to risk that is easily avoided.

EDIT 2 - of above .... oops - replied to myself.
If you give instant feedback about fees (as described above), you have a fee market without the need for RBF. The responsibility for understanding fees stays with the sender - unchanged design there. Just nothing needed in the process from that point on because the Tx just does not enter the system.
So I suspect that suggestion is uncontroversial.
If you couple that with making sacrosanct, that any transaction actually submitted will **not expire** (which is a design change), then Bitcoin  could match the perception that Visa gives .... as long as a Bitcoin transaction is submitted (the equivalent of "Transaction OK" for Visa), users and merchants can complete their trade on the basis of that alone - without waiting for the Tx to make it into a block.
Perhaps expiring transactions is a sub optimal design choice. It leaves a data integrity hole during the 0-conf time frame that under a lot of circumstances is commercially worse than the incumbents (Visa etc) in the payments industry offer.

These various confusions are all possible - even likely. As you say - not pretty.
But you know what, we are faced with political disagreements.This time, there will not be unanimous agreement. So unfortunately there is no way to get a clean split.
75% supermajority is quit a high hurdle anyway - it only takes 66.6% majority alter the USA constitution!
With all the blatant manipulation and censorship techniques that have entered the debate to try and steer the viewpoints of non technical people, we are seeing the political side of people - unsurprising - we are playing with one of the core inventions of humanity. **Money**

Sort of - more like 'very very very improbable after 6 confirms'  ... each extra block makes it much more difficult to cheat...  so:
* 0 blocks (mempool) - possible to double spend, with RBF even easier
* 1 block - hard to double spend
* 2 blocks - harder to double spend
* 3 blocks - even harder   
You get the idea.
By the time you get to

The question is the other way around. It does not arise until 75% of miners are mining with XT.
If the hard fork triggers, exchanges using the 25% chain, will instantly be confronted with blocks every 40 minutes - rather than 10 minutes - as the hash power drops to 100P/hash but the difficulty stays the same. (and more full blocks too, if the most of the non mining nodes have not switched to XT)
So for them, BTC deposits take 4 times as long, for their customers, withdraws take 4 times as long. Business impact for them ... resolve it instantly by switching to XT, or prolong it for many weeks by sticking with the current ~~forkcoin~~**orphaned chain** - credit to for pointing out that term [here](

That is adding reliability to the Transaction input phase - and the merchant has an incentive to do so.
But I contend that it would also be desirable to have that *option* baked into the system. For example, in the user-to user interaction, almost nobody is going to understand the issue, and/or be capable of dealing with it. They will just get very frustrated with Transactions that disappear.
I answered exactly that question two days ago, by friend, who used to work on the IT side of a mega merchant bank (guess a name, J .... you will be right).
He was just looking at the transaction history in his Mycelium wallet which had shown some transfers to/from me (I had been showing how things worked a couple of weeks earlier), and had previously been showing some 0-conf inbound transfers from a Bitcoin faucet.  Very low value of course ... and they had just disappeared! ...
That sort of behaviour really hurts the perception of Bitcoin. I know how and why it happened, but it really hurts the confidence in the system that we need to have.
I can see that we could add an extra concept into the roles that a network participant could use and provide. The role of **Tx Store**, optional, like the Validation role and the Miner role ... but a separate concept. Not currently supported in Bitcoin Core, but an extra capability that would not detract from the other functions...
We could extend the API to have an attribute carried along with a Transaction during it's life in the network whilst it is 0-conf. The attribute gets dropped after the Tx gets added to a block in the block chain, so there is zero change to the mining or validation process.
That attribute would be to request data integrity - IE. Do not lose this transaction. Sort of like the rebroadcast option that Mycelium just added, but respected by any node that cares to provide that **Tx Store** role.
That would spread the responsibility for data integrity during the 0-conf period  to more than just the sender or receiver.  Anyone relying on this data integrity attribute, would be relying on a subset of the entire Bitcoin network - not just the other party in their transaction. That would make it almost certain that a Tx will eventually make it to the Back end settlement phase.
If you allow RBF as well (and why not), the receiving party can always negotiate with the sender to increase the fees, after the event, if they are not being paid as quickly as they would like... but they would remain assured of payment in the long run, even if the fee stays the same - which is better than VISA does with its charge backs.

If luke-jr goes away, that can be seen as a good thing. He has some technical ability, but a lousy general framework view of how commerce works, and close to zero experience in large scale systems, end user impact for retail clients, merchant issues, and the culture of large financial institutions (and telcos) that we are working with.
Reminds me of a mid thirties developer I hired back in 2006 - clever at the code level, useless at understanding the wider project objectives, and destructive or at least counter productive through his actions and interactions with other members on my project. He left after some encouragement. The project development team resumed its successful work level after his *input* was removed.

What do you mean "a factor of 4" - difficulty step changes are limited to 4% every 2016 blocks.
So if you have difficulty level of 52699842409 which gets blocks at 10 minutes intervals with 400 P/hash, and then suddenly you only have 100 P/hash working on it (25% of miners), then you need several YEARS to step that difficulty level down to under 13174960602. That is the difficulty level where 100 P/hash will meet the 10 minute block target.
Look at the actual numbers ... do not think in overall 300% up or 75% down terms... each step can only be 4% of the current setting.. not 4% of the starting setting.

What would be even nicer, would be a design change to Bitcoin, to stop losing data during the transaction input phase.
* 0-conf transactions can get lost.
* The interval before they get lost is indeterminate.
* the feedback about possible loss is poor
This leads to confusion - which is a really bad thing for consumers and merchants alike.
I do realize that making the transaction entry phase of Bitcoin (0-conf) 'safe' in a data integrity sense is very difficult, and a completely disconnected issue from anything about the block chain itself... this is about the time period *before* any miner sweeps up some transactions into a block.
But there are a number of benefits to improving Bitcoin in this direction.
For clarity, I suggest further discussion settles on some terms so it is clear what is being discussed.
* Transaction input phase (the 0-conf stage of dealing with a Tx, from input until included into a block)
* Back end settlement phase (period between when a Tx is written to the block chain, and then becomes at least 6 blocks deep)
This has an exact parallel to competing payment systems .. I will use Visa as an example.
* Transaction input phase (the time after you see Transaction OK when you swipe a card,  until when uncleared funds are posted to the merchant account - often 24 hours or more)
* Back end settlement phase (the time from when Visa says you have funds, until they become clear funds with no risk of a charge back - 6+ months or so)
For the *Back end settlement phase* Bitcoin wins hands down - final settlement in about an hour, versus 6+ months.
For *Transaction input phase* VISA wins hands down. VISA *does not* **lose** *data* after you see that Transaction OK message (or Transaction accepted ...or whatever local message you get)
Setting fees, offering hints on fee levels, supporting **R**eplace **B**y **F**ee are all band-aids that try to work around the basic issue of unreliability/data integrity of the Transaction input phase that Bitcoin currently has.
There is a reason that merchants happily let you walk out the door with your purchase as soon as they see the Transaction OK message on their terminal. 
They are certain that the transaction will definitely make its way to the Back End settlement process .. at some vague point in the future, with possible charge backs... but **it will not be lost**
That lets VISA collect transactions fairly locally, and later push them to the Back End settlement system.
Performance wise, that means a technically easy Transaction Input system, that scales in a linear way,as much as they like.
Bitcoin co-mingles these two phases, as a historical design accident, but does not have to stay that way.
I am planning to write up a proper design document about this, and I guess this concept will get attacked ... but I would rather address a design flaw than spend lots of effort on band-aid tactics.
Ultimately, I expect the system will end up a hybrid - with support for both unsafe TX input and safe Tx input .. since each approach supports different goals. (unsafe Tx approach is trustless, safe Tx needs trust in elements of the system that you do not control)
Just to be clear, the current strategy of 0-conf data being sometimes lost, was not an issue when *every* Bitcoin user was doing all three things: Tx input, blockchain validation, mining.  That situation no longer exists.
At the start, (and now) a node doing all three functions was only trusting themselves and the Bitcoin protocol. Now, if you run an SPV wallet, you are trusting the nodes who are validating blocks, and the miners who are creating blocks. Not individual third party trust (like the banking system uses), but systemic trust at least - with the advantage that if you get suspicious you can always start validating or mining for yourself. The system remains permissionless, which is a substantial advantage, but unless you are doing all three functions, it is no longer totally peer-to-peer and trustless.
Thank you Mycelium for these changes ... in lieu of making Tx input *safe*, these changes are really helpful
Try to use clearer words defining the Back end settlement phase

There are a lot more than 20 developers.  I am a developer, and I am sure you did not count my view. Not everyone is interested in 'core'
Notably, almost all developers had said there will be some need to increase the block size limit. The argument is primarily about when and how.
The only functioning set of code that offers an increase right now is BitcoinXT - BIP101.
It would be good if the people who dislike BIP101, offer an alternative - in code  - not just in theory.
Gavin at least, has created the 'put up or shut up' option to crystallize the debate.

You know, there is an interesting (but irrelevant) little anomaly in this.

You want the other nodes to see the big blocks ... that is the whole point.
A percentage of the network will reject them ... and the longest chain wins.
It becomes an unsubtle battle. What is trying to suggest, is that you should get up front agreement of almost everyone, before attempting to run the revised code. (or even write the code !!)
In this case, and in many situations, the level of prior agreement that he claims is essential, will never be reached. However a supermajority, or even a simple majority of miners can force the situation to get actually resolved - rather than just having an unending debate.
For a modest period of time, there will be two competing chains, which are both Bitcoin, and one of them will become an orphaned chain. says he does not want that process to happen (and it has happened before), but for a controversial change, you get to a point where there is no other way.
That is what Mike Hearn is forcing ... putting things to the 'vote' by making BIP101 available as working code.

I will try to be even more specific.
Every instruction that the CPU can do related to external data, such as **load register**, **store register** .... has as its other argument a RAM location. The CPU literally can not refer to other storage devices for data.
As far as things like disk, it must issue instructions to the IO hardware to **read sector** or **write sector** so that data on those storage devices gert transferred into RAM, before the CPU can actually refer to the data.
So as I said, *everything* must be in RAM at some point - the exact opposite of your statement that *Nothing needs to be [in] RAM ever*

I have a suggestion [here]( that goes towards giving performance down in the **seconds** range (from the UX view) whilst living with the reality that blockchain systems have much longer time frames for settling the consensus view of transactions.
The idea is an **add-on** in functionality, with only local impacts for any/every node that was running this extra capability. Zero impact on the blockchain for validation and mining.

and how do you measure 90% ???
@_date: 2015-08-11 04:45:06
Read this: 
The first retarget will happen as you say - in perhaps 4 weeks. [deleted] See answer below
How long will it be before the 25% chain gets back to 10 minute intervals ??
I have not bothered to do the calculation - but it is ~~many months~~about 4 weeks.
So the 25% chain is overloaded and barely functional as a result, for ~~many months~~ about 4 weeks..
The 75% chain is very functional and has spare capacity - and will happilly respect your current Bitcoin from before the fork.
I wager that rather rapidly, exchanges (who have a business to run)  and all other non-miners, will take the least pain option, and just follow the majority of the miners - the 75% chain.  So then the miners still supporting the 25% chain are suddenly the ones who can not sell their freshly mined coins ... I would wager they change over quickly too.
The integer overflow bug that caused the last (accidental) fork, showed that when money matters, changes get installed very quickly ... less than a week in that case.
All this is just the implication of what Satoshi originally said... bottom of page 3 in the white paper. The valid chain is the longest chain.
So ... the 75% fork will rapidly become the longest chain because the block production rate is much higher. Anyone following the 25% chain is guaranteed to be on the losing side.
And all this is very predictable, and sudden, because the fork does not trigger until it meets that supermajority level of 75%
As a non miner - just run the XT code, and wait - if the supermajority is not triggered, no problem, you are still following the valid chain. If the supermajority is triggered, you automatically follow what is certain to become the longest (and hence *valid*) chain. Only the miner nodes are counted towards that supermajority - what you run will not influence the trigger point.
~~I have done the calculations ... assuming the miners on the 25% branch stay loyal, it takes **268 weeks** before the difficulty adjusts from the current level of 52699842409, down to 13153194428 .... one quarter of the current level, so that it would match the 100 P/hash of the 25% miner pool~~
~~Hmmm ... and the calculations are not really correct as they do not take into account the gradually improving block production rate .. but that only reduces the overall period a modest amount. It is still approx two years before the re targeting interval gets back to 6 weeks ... so the general conclusion is still correct, and my initial estimate of *many months* was still wildly optimistic.~~
EDIT - detail of calculations:
(deleted)  ..... is correct ... chains adjust in 4 weeks...

Should be .... of course ... but for pure network capacity limitations, if you expect Bitcoin to operate on a level reaching towards that of Visa (or similar), then you will end up not having a totally P2P network.
One obvious change, would be to add an extra (optional) service component to validating nodes ... where instead of just supporting SPV peers, you *also* create a client/server protocol to allow extremely light weight wallet software.
Just like you have imap4 servers, and imap4 clients for email . That would mean the lightweight clients would not directly interact with the Bitcoin network. They would just interact with their choice of validating node or nodes.
It introduces a class of trust between that client/server pair, but the upside is that the network requirements for that interaction is much lower than for a full node.
Because this could be done as an extra style of transacting Bitcoin, and would remain permissionless, for some people it would be a valid approach.
The lightweight wallet would still retain control of the private key(s) - and you could at any time use a full (or SPV) node wallet instead - export/import the keys or HD seeds to migrate.
I bet I get lots of negative comments about this concept, but as a totally optional add-on, one that addresses the access requirements for low bandwidth use cases, we should write the code and let the user base decide which style of wallet is suitable for them.
It would make it possible to use the hub/spoke network design where it is necessary because of bandwidth limitations. It would also *not* remove any part of the existing Bitcoin design.
This would be a parallel to the mining structure. Mostly mining is set up as a pool that runs a full node (or maybe a few), but the people doing the hashing connect in a hub/spoke network configuration using (mostly) the stratum protocol. That protocol is not part of the Bitcoin network design ... but it serves a real and useful purpose.
The same could be done for lightweight wallets.

I have direct experience of remittances using GBP/THB  ... and all that was needed to make it work was a local Thai exchange.
I wrote a post [here]( that explains how it compares to using Western Union.
If you can find a Nigerian exchange that provides acceptable BTC to local currency handling, you can easily mimic what I did, but use USD/Naira as the currency pair.
To take the technology part out of things, you can do this for your mother. On your end, buy the BTC needed using your mothers USD (Coinbase or similar).  On the Nigerian end, **you** open an account on the exchange, send the BTC to your exchange account, trade into Naira and withdraw into the relative's local bank account.
I do this using coins.co.th in Thailand, but you will need to check that the same sort of facility is available in Nigeria.
I did find this [exchange]( but have not used them.
Can you create an account with them and see if their services are suitable?  (and report back)
The great thing about this sort of approach, is that local person receiving the funds does not need to learn about Bitcoin, but they get the financial advantage.
Thailand has strong currency controls, but do not mind a THB/BTC (only) exchange to support Thai local interactions with Bitcoin... crazy ... but that is how it is. It appears Nigeria may be similar in approach.

If you do not move Bitcoins after a fork occurs, and before the dust settles and there is a wining fork, you lose zero.  No matter where the coins are controlled - Core, Multibit, Mycellium etc..
Remember, Bitcoins exist on the blockchain - the wallet holds the private key to control them - it does not hold coins.  When there is a hard fork, your coins are recorded in the common history of **both** forks.
It is only when you move them after a fork, that you may be choosing what turns out to be the losing fork ... So just wait until that get settled before doing new transactions.
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:38:17
There is another attribute or service, not originally part of Bitcoins design.
I wrote about it [here](
'safe' Transaction input, at least on a fairly local level, should be easy to achieve, though trying to make 'safe' across the entire network is probably impossible.
If we add this new function (TxStore) as an optional, but fairly widely available facility, a fair bit of the capacity issue of the blockchain is reduced... made less critical.  It would matter far less if your transaction stacked up to 24 hours before being committed to the blockchain, if you are certain to a very high degree that it will *not be lost*.
This would also allow a new approach for Transaction input (only) devices, where they are hub and spoke connected to a node *they* trust, and use some other protocol (normal TCP/IP probably), to get the hub node to submit a Tx for them, and provide status about that Tx ... and their wallet (set of addresses).  That introduces another new optional service for that hub node, but then supports the common real world situation where the communications layer just does not have the bandwidth to handle Bitcoin to some end point devices.
In that approach, only the hub node needs the network resources. The spoke endpoints need a trivial level of communications services, to interact with the hub.  This part of things would **not** really be Bitcoin - trustless - but it would provide a real world gateway into the remote 3rd world environment.
There is yet another enhancement (optional) that could be done with the node to node level of communication. This one would add the concepts shown in mesh networking to the connections between nodes, to reduce the performance issues with just broadcasting transactions.
Once again, not a feature to *replace* the broadcast approach. Broadcast is essential for retaining the permissionless and trustless attributes of Bitcoin. Adding an option to generate node-to-node routing via a self discovering application level mesh network, would be an optimization to reduce network traffic - a known bottleneck area. I would expect nodes that used this, to also, at random times, also revert to some broadcasts - allowing them to test the trust assumptions implicit in a routing network system.
The main thing about all three of these possible enhancements, is that although they need to be implemented in Bitcoin nodes, they are optional add-ons - with no protocol level impact on Bitcoin as regards the blockchain itself. Hopefully that makes these suggestions less controversial.

You are just plain wrong with this comment. On the technical parameters, as long as there is no obvious change to the economic settings, the wider community does not care., and what the miners chose is absolutely what rules.
The critical issue is how changes happen. 
Think through the process of a fork ... the most extreme way is the edge case of 100% miners choose big block limit, and everyone else wants no change to this technical parameter. (both things are unlikely - but for the sake of argument)
Now - all the non miners, have a chain they trust, BUT - no new blocks are being added (no miners using their technical settings)  .. their system is flat out broken. They can start mining if they like - but with the difficulty level set to manage 400 P/hash ... it will take a huge amount of time to see the first block (which happens to be restricted to 1Mb),
A much easier way for these non-miners to solve their problem, is just to accept the technical settings of the miners ... problem fixed in minutes if they do that.... as against many, many months by trying to fight the miners.
This thought experiment is still valid for a 75/25 split in the miners ...
The 25% group is mining against a difficulty set to suit 400 P/has, but they only have 100 P/hash .... so they produce blocks about every 40 minutes.
And the difficulty will only adjust every 2016 blocks, and only in modest steps, and it needs to drop to reflect the 100P/hash they have available. That adjustment will take many months.
Once again, the non mining users (assume 100% for the sake of argument) who persist with the current fork, will effectively be working with a network that is under the same transaction load, but now only has the one quarter of the capacity ... suddenly the 1Mb limit will be getting smashed for almost every block.
Ok - now consider the 75% fork.
It will be mining blocks with 300 P/hash using a difficulty tuned to having 400 P/hash.  Result ....blocks about every 13.3 minutes. And blocks with a bigger transaction capacity (block size limit).
Any non miners following the new fork, will have very little perceptible impact.  This fork will also be adjusting the difficulty downwards to reflect the 300 P/hash being used. Still at every 2016 blocks ... but at 13.3 minutes apart, rather than 40 minutes apart, the adjustment is happening three times as quickly. This fork will stabilize to match the current Bitcoin system attributes much earlier than the 25% fork.
Once again, a much easier way for these non-miners to solve their problem about a system that is having issues, is just to accept the technical settings of the 75% miners ... problem fixed in minutes if they do that.... as against many, many months by trying to fight the miners.
Time and time to change is a critical part of this discussion that no one else seems to mention.
Oh - and last but not least, given the code for the big block limit in XT simply does not get activated until 75% of miners are using the code (a supermajority), for all non miners, it is a **zero risk** approach to run the XT revisions.
Even if you do not want the large block limit to be used, as a non miner, if/when the mining supermajority trigger occurs, you are safe running **XT**, and at risk running **core**. Your choice to run XT, as a non miner, does not count for the supermajority trigger. You are just protecting your own interest if it does happen. If it does not happen - you still remain unaffected.

Luke - you are conflating a software code forks, with blockchain forks.
Both sorts of 'fork' are in play ... and software code forks which deliberately start their own (new) blockchains are what most people call an altcoin.
Software code forks or re-implementations like bitcoinj and btcd, are alternate wallets. They still use the same blockchain.
Where the arguments come in, is when changes that are made to code, imply a blockchain fork. In particular, by implementing BIP101.
The question is about whether BIP101 creates an altcoin by forking the blockchain. I think calling that an altcoin is a poor description. Using that description suits some people who want to win over non technical people by frightening them.
So your diagram which conflates code forks, with blockchain forks, does not help clarify things.
@_date: 2015-08-13 10:48:25
I started the altcoin/forkcoin [thread]( ... and someone kindly enlightened me about a existing term: **orphaned chain** - his post is [here](
I stand corrected. It also means that is definitely wrong to say that Bitcoin core plus the BIP101 changes is an altcoin. It is just a controversial change to Bitcoin  whose adoption or failure will be sorted out in the market place.
This also points out that this sort  of ultimate dispute resolution is baked into Bitcoin.
Sometimes you can install a change that is a fork (hard or soft is irrelevant) with no visible battle between the various groups using Bitcoin.
Sometimes you can not avoid the internal economic battle - but changing the seed nodes and using a different port (which you are free to do anyway while still connected to the Bitcoin ledger) .... that is unnecessary.
Just put your code version out there for people to choose ... and let the community decide - not a self selected set of core developers. Mike Hearn's BitcoinXT (0.11A) will be exactly Bitcoin core plus the BIP101 code....
Why the debate is not silly, is because aside from the technical proposals, it is shining the spotlight on a genuine weakness (centralisation) that has developed in the control of the main codebase, and the primary media channels used by the Bitcoin community.
This is a non technology centralisation, but still a big vulnerability. 
Diversifying the software choices (Bitcoin core, btcd, bitcoinj are not enough) helps reduce the power of individual developers with the repository keys.
Diversifying the media outlets helps resist censorship which has been highlighted during the debate.

I manage to run an open Bitcoin node, plus a litecoin node, plus a Namecoin node, plus a DASH node - all on a regular consumer DSL link (and on an old notebook) 
Luke - I know you live in a network constrained location, and full nodes need a reasonable network. If Bitcoin is to be global in scale for a healthy percentage of the worlds transactions, it simply must have computer and network resources of significant scale too.
Inevitably, that means most nodes will run where the better connected parts of the Internet exist. If you worry about centralisation, that is not automatically the result. You could still get a decent number of full nodes scattered in many jurisdictions, and run by many people. What will gradually be eliminated is nodes where the base infrastructure is too weak.
But new, good infrastructure does get deployed as soon as the commercial activity levels start to justify it.
Once the well connected parts of the world have been swept up by businesses relying on Bitcoin, they will push to extend the network into whatever untapped markets remain. They will push for the upgrading of infrastructure so that they can grow their businesses.

A pre-mine generates a different blockchain. Separate blockchain is what most people use to identify an altcoin. 
How the coins pre-mined get allocated is part of the rules of that altcoin. You are trying to redefine a software fork of code that currently operates in 100% agreement with the rules of all the other Bitcoin wallets as an altcoin, just because it may (and may not) at some future date change the rules it follows, and fork the Bitcoin blockchain and try to pull the economic majority of users with it.

Not quite true..... *only* miners create new blocks. They enforce (with their technical choice of limits) what the consensus is. Their consensus is critical. Without it, other users can not implement any change. They effectively have a blocking vote. The core developers do not - anyone can fork the code to ignore the core developers if they remain intransigent.
In a broader sense, miners are constrained by the need to respect the views of the non miners, because if the miners alter some parameter that destroys the economic parameters of Bitcoin, the users can and would move very quickly to an alt-coin.
If &gt;50% of them agree on some form of software change that relaxes or removes the 1Mb limit ... then eventually that will be the dominant fork of the block chain...  the higher the % that is in the majority group of miners, the more savage the economic pressure on the other miners is.  That is why the current suggestion is for the change to kick in at 75% of recent blocks indicating support for the revised limit.
Non miners have a different issue, they need to ensure they always follow the majority of the hash power and the parameters that group of miners agree on.
And for anyone who is not a miner, but wants to have zero impact on their business, it makes a huge amount of sense to switch to the XT (0.11) code base as soon as Mike Hearn releases it.
* If the consensus is NOT reached, you are **unaffected**.
* If the consensus IS reached, you are **unaffected**.
Switching to XT (0.11) is a zero risk choice.... staying with Bitcoin core means risking disruption if consensus IS reached.
I have already switched to XT - and if the world gets around to a consensus, I will be unaffected.

That is a typical American centric assumption. It is ambiguous and assumes that everyone is using the MM/DD/YY date format.
A whole lot of the world does not. Bitcoin is international.  If you wish to use that sort of format, then it is always better to represent the month as text rather than a number.
Eg.  Nov/04/17 is not ambiguous.  Nor is 04/Nov/17 for the European style date presentation.
All the other dates suffer the same possible ambiguity.

Merchants, especially large merchants, have an incentive to run a full node, and the financial resources to do so too.
So as long as we get serious overall uptake in usage, the number of full nodes should increase rather than decrease - the percentage may drop as more and more unsophisticated end users join in, using web wallets in particular, but still an increasing number of full nodes.
Take the use case of department store. They can probably justify a node in their basement and the network link needed, just to ensure that their point of sale devices work reliably without any external dependencies. Even with external connectivity issues, they can still accept transactions. In this situation, they are not dependant on a link to Visa or their bank functioning 100% of their opening hours. They would be 'being their own bank'
A chain of department stores can probably justify a node in most stores!!

Ok - I do not understand why you say that.  The current soft limit controls the maximum size an individual miner node will use when constructing a *new* block, but not the size of a block that it accepts from other miners.
If the soft limit applied to the same actions as the current protocol level 1Mb limit I would agree with what you said.... but with the old library limit of 32Mb as the only protocol limit in place (as in the original code), there will be no hard forks.
If many miners voluntarily stay with (say) 2Mb blocks by choice (soft limit), then the network behaves with as if it had that limit. But as long as it is a soft limit, it can be easily and progressively altered by individual miners according to their preferences.... without creating a hard fork.
We have actually had that situation for years ... a soft limit that is lower than the hard limit. And some miners stuck to a max of 750kb, others chose a different number - all are respecting the protocol level limit of 1Mb.
The same situation could be rolled out with different numbers ..... 2M and 32Mb as an example.

Use a Linux distro on that old laptop.
Plug in one or more USB HDD's  (I like the price of the 1Tb units) ... map them into an LVM managed device, format that device, mount it wherever you install the node data directory (usually /var/lib/bitcoin)  ... then you can add more USB(s) as the storage requirements grow .. and the new HDD's get cheaper.
You need to learn about how Linux uses disk drives and about LVM and how it allows easy management of changing storage sizes (it does lots more too), but there are plenty of good tutorials available.
For a nice lazy way to set that stuff up, you could use either Linux Mint or Centos as the distribution of choice - both are comprehensive, and well supported.
I am bit hardcore and use the Gentoo distribution - but I have been in the IT world as a deep tech person for more than 40 years, so my personal choices are not mainstream. As a beginner you should stick to a mainstream Linux distribution like Mint or Centos
Bonus hint:
Whichever Linux distribution you choose, install Webmin. It is a web based system management tool that allows you to have a browser based remote administrator tool. If you are coming from Windows experience, this will shelter you from the command line needs of Linux.  Drive your node remotely from your normal desktop through a browser.  Even though I have decades of Unix experience, I still find it a great tool ... let's me forget many low level details, and with creeping age, that is a real plus.

I agree wholeheartedly that they are tackling a less difficult scenario, and using  that delay tactic for confirmations to reduce their problems.
They also have a huge advantage - they can centrally plan and pre-configure their network.
Bitcoin uses an ad-hoc and broadcast approach to remove the network (manual) configuration issue. This deliberate design feature of Bitcoin makes it a much more difficult project.
*And that is my point.* VISA has a much easier capacity planning task, because their system has simpler requirements, yet they, after decades of running things, provision a **huge** safety margin. I take that as a big hint.
As far as doing better with a week to confirm. That is better for the back end business aspect, but VISA achieves customer/merchant feedback in a couple of seconds, consistently, whereas Bitcoin is often worse by that metric.
The delayed true confirmation (6+ months) is a sneaky way to let them achieve that performance, but it remains true, that from the customer/merchant perspective, a VISA transaction takes seconds.  That perception is what Bitcoin is being compared to.
EDIT: thinking more.
Effectively, when VISA says 'Transaction Ok' (in seconds) - that is the equivalent of a Bitcoin 0-conf transaction, with an extra guarantee that VISA will not discard it under any circumstances. They may reverse it, but never just lose it.
Correct me if I am wrong, but there is no similar guarantee for Bitcoin transactions pending in the mempool? IE, until a transaction makes it into a block, it may simply disappear (node crash is an example). Even a 1-conf block may get orphaned and lose the transactions recorded in it? Those transactions may or may not be included in the successful block that caused the other block to be orphaned. 
I am a bit busy at the moment, but I will give you a 'for the record' bit of personal history, about a software/communications tool that I was the architect and lead developer for back in the late 80's - for Telstra (Australia's national Telco).
It had an eerily similar structure to the combination of SPV wallets and Bitcoin nodes.
Lots of details - but in brief - 3 sets of communication technologies(VTAM, IP, Hyperchannel), 2 character sets(ASCII, EBCDIC), a single unified API (but 3 languages - Cobol, C, PL/1), 34 different system types, some scale (4th largest transaction system used in Telstra), partly configured, some self configuration, self optimizing for performance of the API users. Oh,,, and 24/7 operation without any upgrade windows.
That system (called TEXAS, **T**ransaction **EX**change **A**rchitecture and **S**ervices) - was *less complex* than Bitcoin and had a much lower scope ... but had lots of parallels - which is why I get fairly direct about some less experienced comments I see, and probably why I had no problem understanding the nuts and bolts of Bitcoin at the technical and systems level.
In the 6 years I was involved with TEXAS, on all aspects of it - including daily operational matters, I saw the multiple performance issues that arise. I see all the same sorts of things happening with Bitcoin, which is why I think you are wrong to suggest that Bitcoin is *entirely new* in the problems being exposed. They may be new to you, but most of them are not new to me, and apparently not new to some other people.
The economic side of Bitcoin on the other hand, has been a revelation, and fascinating research for me for the past few years. I have been learning a lot from the experts in that area. For the economic issues, and trading too - I am definitely the novice.

I did say the test revealed a real problem.  The mempool backs up under a load of 200,000 tx.  An infinitely growing mempool will break things.  That is a real problem.
The fact that the stress test was not run long enough to start to see the detailed effects of when nodes start breaking all over the place does not mean we did not observe a problem situation under way. A real problem.
If you want to actually see that sort of breakage, it is only a matter of re-running the stress test for long enough to break things. Not an idea I am in favour of.
EDIT.  Apologies for misunderstanding your attitude to high value transaction transactions..    You are correct a limited market Bitcoin system is not the same as the system grinding to a halt.  But if people still try to use it beyond the available capacity (regardless of any fee market), it will grind to a halt for while. Then most of the potential user base will abandon this experiment.

What is coming, very definitely is not an *unexpected* peak... it is a *predictable* peak... some time in 2016.   That will trigger the unreliability matter, which is why there is some growing urgency to resolve the capacity limit of the 1Mb blocks.
Bitcoin will not implode as you say .... not at the technology level.
However, markets hate uncertainty. Markets are groups of people .... so if users start getting bad experiences - regardless of cause - this experiment called Bitcoin could suffer a fairly big reverse in fortune. Far better to resolve this predictable capacity issue before it harms the user experience.
I do not want to drive users away for perceived reliability issues (or a fees war either)
I believe Bitcoin would recover from the problems I am describing, as long as the trigger for uncertainty is fixed.  But it would be better to avoid the predictable problems before hurting the user base.
About my suggestion to immediate feedback. I am looking through the core code and the SPV wallets at the moment to see how difficult that would be to implement.
As you say, there is always the possibility that a transaction accepted by a node would get dropped later. But if nodes set their view of mempool overload to a pragmatic value, then the transactions that node accepts will always get put in a block. Nodes that set stupid limits would be unreliable (for users), others would be reliable - a competitive advantage perhaps.
Personally, I run my own node, so I would set the limits very low and reject my  uncertain transactions immediately. Better to know early and not have your funds in limbo.
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:48:22
That thread just supports my comment that it is fairly easy (network wise) to run a full node.
The fact that lots of people choose SPV wallets, is simply that they are far easier to run than the original reference code.
I run some SPV wallet(s) too - on Android. Purely from an ease of use point of view. But I can point them at my own node to be confident of the security. Most people will not bother doing that, but not because of network capacity limitations. Just ease of use considerations.

No one can force any other node to do anything - agreed.  BUT if the non mining nodes follow the minority (hash power) chain, they end up with losses as soon as other nodes follow the majority chain.
It is as simple as that - the minority chain will be the losing set of people after a modest period of time ... simple self interest will drag people to the rules of the majority chain.
The one exception that I believe to not go with that, is any attempt (even with a majority of hash power) to alter the fundamental economic theory behind Bitcoin. IE. Diminishing, limited supply money ... aka hard money, that supports the Austrian theory of economics.
Eg.  My response as someone who runs a non-mining node, to a majority of miners trying to subvert those parameters (21m max coins etc), would be to stick to old rules, and turn on my mining equipment again - even though it would cost me in national fiat to pay the electric bill. The integrity of the network is too important to me.
A good example of not being *forced* but being heavily *encouraged* is taking an upgrade to &gt;=0.9.5 version of bitcoin core. You are not forced too, but given the clear known software issues with early versions (which led to the recent fork) , you are risking a commercial impact if you do not upgrade.
In a similar vein, I will run the 'big block limit' code on my node as soon as it is available. A majority of the mining community has already said they intend to support some sort of 'large block limit' change, and it is of zero impact to me if I implement the change ahead of them.
My node will just automatically take advantage of the fork if/when it happens, and keep working just fine if it never happens. That is the safest approach that a non-mining node can take. Zero impact either way on transactions that my node uses.
@_date: 2015-07-29 08:02:48
I do for starters. Since we are now seeing the network hit 'full' capacity - effective maximum, not theoretical maximum, we are also seeing backlog situations that are becoming non-trivial in their effects on end users.
To me, when you start have end user impact, then somewhere in your provisioning choices, you have made what is *now* an **inappropriate** decision. (even though the choices were fine in the past)
IE. Usage levels have changed (in this case by some spammer), to the point where normal levels of service are impacted.
That makes it time to work rather hard on improving things ...

I see the intransigence of the core developers as an attack on the viability of Bitcoin.
The same intransigence happened with X11  (Unix graphics project) ... ultimately a group of developers created the Xorg alternative software base.
They were responsive to the needs of their user base - X11 has faded and is basically history.
Since there is serious money involved with Bitcoin, I predict that a software fork, to support the wider needs of the user base (in this case, better performance limits) will probably be resolved in the same way, but a lot faster.

I am impressed.... pretty gutsy to say the whitepaper is wrong ....
Ok ... lets lay it out carefully.
At the very base of the things, is the idea that the longest blockchain is the valid chain - without that you are not resolving the Byzantine Generals problem, so ALL miners (and others) must follow that rule. Not negotiable.
As you point out, you could say longest *valid* blockchain, though Satoshi did not.
When you add *valid* (data) as an idea, you start including all the other rules that the &gt;50% hash power agrees on. That is things like:
* block target interval - 10 minutes
* difficulty recalc interval - 2016 blocks
* monetary system parameters - 21M coins max, 50 coin block reward (decreasing).
* transaction system parameters - mix of fee, non fee, older etc inclusion rules for storing tx in a block
* 1Mb hard limit for block size
etc ... lots of little details.
There is clearly a hierarchy of how contentious  making changes to any of these various attributes is .. and it is a tribute to Satoshi's genius that his initial choices have held up so well in real world use.
Make no mistake, &gt;50% hash power can force a change at the **technical** level, in any of the attributes considered *valid*. The other miners and the general community may utterly disagree, and are always free to add their own rules to ignore that longer chain being mined. You would then end up with two continuing chains and an economic war between the two groups and their supporters among  the non-miners. (Politics in other words)
That sort of fork would be disastrous to the reputation of Bitcoin - and of course that is why so much effort is being expended on getting a peaceful proactive solution to the 1Mb limit change ... which is amongst the most minor of possible changes!
So a resolution of the details of what is a *valid* block is enforced at a **technical** level by &gt;50% of the hash power (miners).
But they need to have reasonable agreement from the wider community who use Bitcoin, or otherwise they will suffer an economic backlash. It is a typical tradeoff you find in many aspects of life.
Eg. If the &gt;50% miners decided to change the 21M coin limit, the rest of the world would almost certainly just write them off - ignore them. It would be so contentious that it just would not be accepted !!..  They might have the **technical** ability to force that change, but the instant real world backlash would destroy them. The &gt;50%  hash power miners do not have the **political** ability to force that sort of change. So that sort of parameter is effectively *set in stone*.
This interaction between competing interests using the technical control, against the real world economic power of the user base, seems to be a brilliant and healthy self regulating dynamic.
I suspect it only works because you are not coerced into using Bitcoin - unlike national fiat currencies, where state sponsored violence is used. You are forced to use the local currency to pay taxes, and failure to do so results in loss of liberty or your possessions. That removes any feedback needed to keep the national fiat system honest.

The *invalid blocks* were being mined by a **minority** of the hash power. That is why their chain rapidly became useless and has been abandoned.
The odd thing about this latest split, was that it went on for more than one block. Usually [stale blocks]( (or orphans) are discovered immediately ... this time, because some miners were not validating the chain, things got out hand and we had a split.
Once this was pointed out, the miners doing this, realised they were in the minority (hash power wise) and that unless they corrected this error, their mining was about to be useless. A massive incentive to rejoin the consensus, and the result was they corrected their software to match the rules used by the majority of the hashing power.

My way to distinguish a forkcoin, is that it **only** alters a technical parameter (or maybe more than one). It retains the genesis block, the economic rules and all the block chain history up to the moment of the hardfork requirement.
In that sense, Bitcoin core is a "forkcoin"  and is the current incarnation that has evolved from Satoshis original creation. Correct me if I am wrong, but there have been two hardforks so far.
* the first implemented the 1Mb limit, as DOS prevention measure - with some reluctance from Satoshi
* the second was a response to the integer bug back in 2013 - with widespread and rapid acceptance - though there must have a been a few laggards, so - not *unanimity*
If there are any others that you remember, I would love to know of them.
So as to your question re the example of Feathercoin/Litecoin ... they do not fit the definition I just gave, so they would be altcoins to Bitcoin, and altcoins from each other, and your views on excluding them from or on that basis could survive scrutiny.
I am pointing out the BitcoinXT could easily end up the evolutionary successor to the current technical rules part of Bitcoin.
I know that you and are not against increasing the capacity and performance of the network. You have views on the optimum way to achieve that, and on when it should be attempted, and I along with others hold different views - especially on the timing.
I should add for other readers, that the term 'technical parameters' sometimes does **not** include what at first glance seems technical.
A prime example of that is the target block rate of one every ten minutes... Sounds technical right?
It actually affects the distribution pattern of the money supply growth in Bitcoin - an economic parameter. So any change to it is an economic change. The same goes, somewhat more obviously, for things like the halving schedule - a technical number, but really an economic parameter. An then you have the 21M money supply limit - very obviously an economic parameter. 
So if you restrict the discussion to remain around the technical parameters only, you manage to cut off a lot of irrelevant debate from people using [red herrings]( either deliberately or from ignorance.
The technical parameters discussion is challenging enough. Any revision has ramifications, There will be tradeoffs to be made.
So far, Bitcoin has evolved from entirely peer-to-peer, trustless, permissionless.
The three primary functions remain as:
* mining - which extends the block chain
* validating  - which confirms the integrity of the blockchain
* transaction entry - enters data for the miners to record
These days, SPV wallets only do the transaction entry function, and rely on other nodes to validate, and a subgroup of those nodes to mine.
So the non-miners now trust the system of miners to record things, and SPV wallets also trust other nodes to do the validating for them.  That is a subtle evolution that has introduced a bit of systemic trust.
That change is almost certainly behind some developers fear of centralisation. And that concern is reasonable - but it needs to be balanced against the fact that the mining arms race to ASICs meant that having every one being a miner was just no longer practical, and the wider user base has no real qualms about a fairly diffuse level of trust that flows from the current mining approach. It has risks, but those risks can be countered as long as the system remains *permissionless*
SPV wallets rely on (trust) both validating nodes (to check they are looking at the right data), and miners (to sweep their transactions into a block and record it)... and that is a risk that was not present originally. The tradeoff was made to lower the barrier to entry for user devices (especially phones), and thus dramatically increase the potential user base. A smart tradeoff as far as I can see - once again, with the proviso that it is only reasonable as long as the system remains *permissionless*. That way, anyone can establish their own validating node if they wish.
**Increasing the block size limit - no matter which strategy is used - or leaving it unchanged, has risks**.
Adjusting any of the technical parameters of the Bitcoin network, impacts the potential market scope, and may imply centralisation, but that is part of the unavoidable tradeoffs.
For the record, I am utterly against any changes to the economic parameters of Bitcoin - that is what really would destroy trust.
However, I want to improve the performance of Bitcoin, with the least rollout risk, and with the minimum levels of tradeoff in centralisation, and without generating unavoidable trust bottlenecks.

Interesting thing to find out. 
How does a node (mining or not) predict that a transaction will be included in the next block that is mined?
As far as I can tell, you can not work out what the miner of the next block is going to chose to put in it.  We know what the overall rules are for transaction priority - [here](
I guess it would be good enough to calculate the priority of the transaction your node is being asked to accept, and then look at the mempool, pretend you just mined a block, and see it you would include this requested transaction.  If your node would include it, you have a good chance that the miner who gets the next block will do so too.
Even though your node may not be mining, you would then need to set sensible mining parameters.  Eg .. set the soft block limit to 800kb, and then your test would imply near certainty that the requested transaction would get included in a 1Mb block if it passes your test. At the very least it would probably get into the 2nd block mined after it was submitted.

Well that is not true - the integrity of the block chain (its security) depends on being resistant to a number of different attack vectors.
There is a fairly comprehensive list [here](
You will notice that increase/decrease in *number of nodes* is not mentioned - nor is any *ratio to users* as you suggest.
The attack vector that the number of nodes **could** help address, is where a government level agency uses traditional coercive tactics to suppress or modify the network.
As long as there are multiple nodes in multiple jurisdictions that attack is not feasible, so there is an ideal minimum .... a number greater than the number of countries (166??? I think) and distributed to cover every jurisdiction. We are well above that number of nodes at present.
There IS a need for some ratio of nodes to users (SPV wallet users), simply from a performance perspective. It takes some resources to deal with each SPV wallet that connects to a full node - which is one of the reasons I run my own (non mining) node. I get consistent performance by having a dedicated node for my phone wallets(s) to connect to.

I realise 2FA solves a lot of security problems, but can make privacy problems worse. Unless you offer multiple alternate 2FA tools, and make them optional, the 2FA can become an attack vector.
Eg. 2FA via SMS (IE your phone number) - that automatically connects your account to your real world identity via the phone records. That opens the way to traffic analysis that ultimately can reveal where an attack should be directed. Lots of traffic? Yes, probably lots of Bitcoins... identify person via phone number (just ring it and ask!!) .. find address of person...  attack using old fashioned extortion tactics.....

But it does raise the probability of any given transaction getting into a block. So any disruption is smaller.
A perfect parallel is in the foreign exchange markets.
In small (low liquidity) markets - eg. BTC/USD ... with any spamming (attempts to dry up liquidity and push prices around) ... it takes very little resources to cause volatility.
In hugely liquid markets - eg. USD/JPY .... even massive attacks have only a minor affect on liquidity, and as a result there is low volatility.
This Bitcoin spam attack is 'eating the liquidity' of available space in blocks .. raising the block limit makes the 'market' of slots in a block, more liquid, less volatile. Volatility in this case, shows up in the variability in time for your transaction to get through.

Hmmm ... The [alert notice](
The situation was more complex. One of the 5% of miners who had not upgraded generated a bad block... that should have been very quickly rejected by the rest of the network. Unfortunately, some of the miners (F2Pool and AntPool) were not really running the full validation as expected - and as they were reporting. So the bad blocks triggered a fork.
However, F2Pool and AntPool were still a minority of the hash power. A significant minority though - that may be why the branch survived more than one block deep.

Western Union? half round the world for free?
You seem to have an unusual definition of **free!**
Western Union here in the UK charges a fee, and gives lousy exchange rates for converting to foreign currencies
I did a comparison (in detail) a few months ago, and even with the double currency conversion, it was still about 10% cheaper to use Bitcoin as the transfer mechanism over the Western Union process.
The [worked example is here](
I still regularly use this process - and still save about 10% over using WU - every time.
Money is in the receiving account in about 30 minutes (3 confirms), as long as I send the Bitcoin in the Thai business hours of coins.co.th.  WU has the same sort of restriction on the receiving end.

(1) I mean that it is robust, in the sense that it can recover from a **temporary** stress situation without any special actions. 
(2) changes in human responses (selecting fees), will always be slower than technical issues.
And you are right, I think it is undesirable to exclude low value transactions. Visa and et al. are deliberately trying to get into the very small transactions market - using *swipe* (NFC) technology to encourage it.  For Bitcoin to be very successful it needs to be able to match that.
I want Bitcoin to be VERY successful - and that means pervasive. Why are you in favour of limiting the scope to only high-value transactions?
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:44:15
I strongly disagree.  This all goes back to the definition of consensus.  The &gt;50% hash power has the **technical** power to change anything.
What you are describing is the equally real **political** power of all the other users of the system.
I wrote about the subtle difference at length in [this thread](
If you think I missed something, please explain precisely what.
Note: the **technical** power manages automatic fixing of minor forks on a regular basis (orphan block). Where the argument is about rules beyond  *the valid chain is the longer chain*, you have an argument that gets resolved in a **political** manner which is a completely different process and occurs outside the blockchain itself.

Capacity planning is not a new field of computer science. There is a lot of expertise available from those of us with significant multi decade experience.
Since you seem to be acknowledging that in the capacity planning area, you are not an expert, perhaps you should defer to the experience of those who are. Planning for *peak load* is one of the basics .... 
In the new areas of knowledge that Bitcoin exposes - fine - your estimates are as good as any one else.
You have a role as a long time core developer who has significant influence. With that influence goes a responsibility to act with care.
In areas where you do not have appropriate expertise, and others do, the responsible path of action is to abstain from commenting - or just comment that you are leaving that discussion to other people with relevant experience.
Otherwise, you will confuse the discussion for people who are following it. And that would constitute adding risk to the entire project. Something I am sure you do not want laid at your doorstep.
I should add, all I am recommending is that we ensure the artificial capacity limit of Bitcoin is relaxed, sooner rather than later - to minimise the risks. I am not promoting any particular solution. Later on, there will need to be more difficult work, as the system comes up against technical capacity limits rather than the current arbitrary self imposed 1Mb limit.

The trouble with using the word inflation, is that it gets used in several contexts, and you are relying on the reader to understand which context you are implying.
The most widely used context is *price inflation* - which is not directly connected to *money supply growth*  (related of course, but not directly tied)
Because of that common usage, your meaning may get lost. I suggest it is helpful to be more precise.
@_date: 2015-07-16 08:28:35
You might like to look at the chart of transaction growth [here](
You can ignore that latest spike - that is the spam.  You can not ignore the predictable up trend in genuine transactions. These are not an unpredictable spike. The growth is observable and predictable.
According to that graph, the network currently has genuine transactions of about 130,000.  We start getting backlog issues somewhere below the 190,000 peak shown by the spam spike.
If you extrapolate the approx growth of genuine transactions, you get to the backlog level somewhere in early 2016 ... or about then.
More expensive fees or not, at that point your end user starts getting transactions dropped. The lowest fee transactions - no matter what that fee is in absolute terms, still get dropped.  And it takes a day or two the user to find out and either re-submit the Tx, or have value return to their wallet.
Put very simply, once the average transaction load exceeds the block limit capacity of the network (regardless of Tx fee strategies), user reliability for making transactions is compromised. Some get dropped - with day(s) of indeterminate outcome for the user.
It does not matter that the system is *working as designed*. This sort of **unreliability as perceived by end users** will turn them away.
The only way to fix this is to adjust the capacity of the system, in advance of the transaction load. Increase the block limit, and have it deployed before early 2016.
Another suggestion: (but we still need to increase the block limit fairly soon)
If transactions were not able to be submitted (with immediate feedback) when the mempool of the node you are connecting to is over capacity.... that might help a lot too.
IE. Try to send... get immediate feedback like: *Bitcoin is fairly busy, it will not accept your transaction at the moment without a higher fee*
If you had immediate feedback, and your transaction did not get into the mempool, the uncertainty would be removed, and the user would not become confused, AND their funds would not leave their wallet and be in limbo for days.
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:04:54
You are speaking about a technical result ... specifically low ~~value~~fee transactions being (eventually) rejected. Nice and accurate - technically.
But - from a user perspective, that is a definite failure.
* Submit transaction (looks like it was accepted)
* nothing happens for a considerable period - days
* total confusion about what has happened (user is not technical)
* no one to complain to (aka a bank)
* transaction gets ejected from mempool
* wallet may/may not (depending on wallet design) re-submit transaction
I mention the resubmit thing, because there was a thread about Mycelium doing that. And the user had already sent the payment again with a higher fee (to keep the supplier happy).  Then their wallet sent the original payment again, and they are left hoping to get a refund from that supplier for paying twice. (not double spend)
If that sort thing starts happening a lot, normal users will run away in droves.
Even if the wallet does not re-submit, the user has a period of days where that payment is in limbo and there is nothing they can do - they can not even cancel a 0-conf transaction.  And they do not know what is going on. From their point of view, their money has just vanished into the air.  It certainly has not arrived at the receiving end - unless 0-conf is being accepted by that supplier.
And then, perhaps days later, the money re-appears in their wallet?
The user perception is most likely to be that Bitcoin is unreliable.
For merchants who accept 0-conf, when transactions get dropped from the mempool in this scenario, they lose the payment. They too, will be a bit peeved, and may quickly re-think their 0-conf policy.

No - and if we take Lukes definition - unanimity - then his term of **supermajority** might be a more explicit word.
Although most people use the word consensus to describe how Bitcoin resolves any issues about which fork of the blockchain is valid, it really done by **majority** (of hash power) - not even **supermajority** is needed.
Simple **majority** of hash power &gt;50%, will eventually become the longer chain (Satoshi's paper explains it at the bottom of page 3).
So in a sense, I like that Luke has rearranged this debate by introducing the **supermajority** word. It is probably a more accurate way to describe what is proposed with XT block limit changes.

Merge mining already exists .... NameCoin is the prime example. The main difference to what you sort of suggest is that there is effectively a floating exchange rate rather than some tied mechanism.
My own view is that NameCoin is a vastly underused resource.
It is already:
* very established on the various exchange systems
* designed as a key/data storage system which is the basis of almost all Bitcoin 2.0 requirements.
* protected by a good percentage of the Bitcoin hash power
* very short of developer resources, so a interested player could have significant influence in extending it in ways required for Bitcoin 2.0 services
To me, that is a opportunity gradually going to waste.
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:34:21
Inaccurate.  If less than 75% of the miners accept the protocol change, the code is never triggered.
So - it is perfectly safe (and desirable in fact) to run the XT version.  IF (and only if) the thresholds are met, you will automatically be on the majority chain.
It that criteria is not met, your node happily follows the main chain anyway.... zero to lose, except for *losing* the possibility of being caught out by a hard fork. That is a plus in my mind - being prepared for a real possibility, with no cost if the event never happens.
@_date: 2015-07-05 12:50:58
Zero conf  .... but it IS reasonable to wait until the transaction has been broadcast to the network.
Try doing a Mycelium to Mycelium transfer (two phones) ... you usually get notification of the zero conf transaction being visible within 10 seconds or so.  That proves the sender had the funds and that they got your receiving address correct.  I guess the network could drop the transaction through an overload situation, but there are not too many ways to stop the transaction getting confirmed at a later point.
As long as it is only for a low value, most retailers will take the risk.
If you are paying for an expensive car, sit and have an extra cup of coffee (or champagne) while you both wait for the confirmations. It will still be faster than trying to organize a bank cheque.

I agree with you. XT is a direct source code derivative of Bitcoin Core and as a result is an alternative implementation of a Bitcoin full node.
There are several other software bases for being a Bitcoin full node.  bitcoinj and btcd spring to mind. These are ALL bitcoin node software versions. Not alt-coins.

Can I introduce a very careful change in the choice of words.
clued me up to being more precise about words when we were discussing **consensus** - there was lots of debate about how that was defined. There still is.  pointed out that the correct term for what BitcoinXT was based on was a **supermajority** - he was and is correct.
is saying that BitcoinXT will be an **altcoin** - I strongly disagree.
As far as I can tell, all the hundreds of altcoins out there share a few attributes:
* new genesis block
* technical parameters that probably differ from Bitcoin
* economic parameters that may differ from Bitcoin
* zero knowledge or recognition of the Bitcoin blockchain up to the point where they start.
So - BitcoinXT only matches ONE of those descriptions - a (small) change to technical parameters - with of course unknown ramifications.
Since BitcoinXT shares the genesis block, and the entire transaction history of Bitcoin gets preserved, and the economic parameters remain unchanged.... it fails the common perception of the changes that match the description **altcoin**.
So what is it?
I suggest we use the term **forkcoin** - it is a coin which is definite a break from the current Bitcoin - a hard fork. Let us use a word that reflects that precise difference.
For to suggest the change is an *altcoin* is either unsubtle, or disingenuous.
As a matter of precision, I would like to know how feels about using a new and carefully defined term (forkcoin) rather than the inaccurate word *altcoin*

The stress test showed the maximum **effective** throughput of the system is around 200,000 tx per day - roughly half of the theoretical limit.
We learned that the system is robust under degrading levels of performance, but only if that transaction load eventually lightens up to sustainable levels.
If the transaction load persists to be beyond the effective load limit, clearly the degradation of performance will progressively get worse.
The stress test did not persist long enough to get into that situation - but a real, ongoing load level around the 200,000 mark would. An infinitely growing backlog in the mempool is not something any node can withstand. Some higher fee transactions would still be going through up until the point where your node hits the memory limits of it's hardware. Linux under memory stress just starts killing tasks to try and save itself (I am not sure about Windows). If you use swap files to allow huge memory limits, your system performance collapses. With a backlog building up, and no relief going to happen, at some point, node after node is going to crash. Actual failures. Each node will recover of course, but any idea of stability for the user starts to be compromised.
Performance degradation does not proceed in a linear manner. We know from what happens with Unix systems (and mainframes) when you increase load past the effective capacity of the system.  A small issue cascades in an exponential fashion to drag the system to halt (from the users viewpoint), even though things are still grinding along in the background.
If we get to that point, the sky will be falling - as you put it.
That is the point of capacity planning - to avoid a predictable problem.  It is better to get the extra capacity earlier than you need, rather than suffer an avoidable issue.

(3) The stress test demonstrated the tx volume that starts to build a mempool backlog. 200,000 tx per day approx.
Look at the tx growth chart .... that level should hit in normal use, by about mid 2016.  So about mid 2016, the system should start its exponentially decaying performance curve .... aka - sky falling.
So we have around a year to relieve this capacity issue.  I hope I am wrong and the performance issues are not due until 2017 ... but it is not a chance that any responsible planner would take.

I did not mean to imply growth at any cost. I meant that unless the user base grows to whatever the natural maximum market penetration is, Bitcoin will die as a failed experiment.
We do not know the realistic market size for Bitcoin - theoretical limit is 100% of  global commerce. Practical limit will be lower - but we have no real way to determine how much lower.
I do not wish to arbitrarily limit the capacity of the network, and limit its adoption.
You highlight the simplistic concept of people being less able to afford something when the price rises .... true, but not the complete picture as regards the number of nodes that will exist.
At the same time as the costs rise, the pool of people who make that decision about running a node, is also growing - and exponentially at present. We are at the foot of the [adoption S-curve]( {Innovator phase}
To put some numbers around this as an example.
Assume that running a node costs $10/month at the moment, and only 10% users choose to run a node.  If increased bandwidth costs move that up to $15/month, then a lower percentage of users will run a node .... say (as an example)  7% of users.
But if the user base grows by 50% - which is why the bandwidth costs go up - then the actual *number* of nodes will increase ... 7% of a 50% larger number of users, will be more than 10% of the current set of users.
So increasing the block size limit, whilst reducing the percentage of users who run a node, may (depending on actual costs/growth in user numbers) **increase** the number of nodes.
@_date: 2015-07-29 06:04:41
But removing the 1Mb will change the possible severity of an extreme version of this attack. It will not make it impossible, but a bigger limit will improve how quickly the system recovers after any attack.
IE. If the mempool backlog can only be cleared 1Mb at a time, rather than (say) 8Mb at a time.... recovery is slower.
Wallets understanding fees is a good improvement, but not a solution. It just provokes a biding war in fees - with the spammer in control.  It does not address the underlying congestion and backlog caused by the spammer.
One specific characteristic of the system could be worked on to help the user experience.
At the moment, (regardless of fee level), if you submit a transaction ... that is it.  It is in the system and waits as long as it needs to - perhaps days. During that period, you have spent your money, but the other party has not received it.  Just like writing cheque and waiting for it to clear, and perhaps the same time scale if Bitcoin is really overloaded.
If the node you submit your transaction to, looks at the mempool, it could (based on local settings) decide to reject your transaction instantly, because that node believes the backlog is too high for your transaction (at whatever fee you chose) to get through in a reasonable time. The settings to make that decision could be just local to that node ... and do not have to be too precise.
The big advantage of rejecting a transaction immediately (under load) is that the user gets instant feedback, and retains access to their money. They can try again with a higher fee if the want, or pay using some other method or channel. Either way, they are in control and the Bitcoin has one less transaction pending until they make their decision.

The article, which I find to be a bit flaky and derogatory, correctly identifies a Bitcoin attribute which is of value to some people. The fact that it is immune to government attempts at capital controls.
They could have mentioned that many of Bitcoins attributes which ordinary people should find interesting, essentially add up to being ways to remove government and bank interference in day to day trading activities.
Enabling the unbanked people with the ability of improved trade is what you mention - and doing without any involvement of banks or government.

The sky will fall .... this *stress test* was always going to be a time limited situation, but actually getting to the same transaction level with normal transactions means a sustained load (with peaks), and then there will be no possibility of clearing the backlog. That would be a catastrophe and planning ahead to avoid it means we need to fix the block limit very soon. Capacity planning means to taking into account the lead times needed to get the majority of the network ready ... and that will probably take a year.
@_date: 2015-07-26 13:12:29
Ok - I appreciate that indefinite scaling is impossible, but we could remove the protocol level hard limit, but set a default pragmatic soft limit (like the current 750kb default).
No doubt the miners would come to some commonality there, constrained by their own particular bandwidth problems.
At least then, we would avoid another hard fork, and the debate about the pragmatic choice for block limit could continue as long as people like.

Not quite. As a miner, you could remove the hard limit right now, but you would need to set a soft limit of 1Mb to ensure that you did not create a block that triggers a temporary fork. If you try to store a &gt;1Mb block at present, the majority miners will reject your new block and you lose the block reward.

No ... on the 25% chain, you would need to make up the lost 75% of hash rate if you are still using the 100% difficulty setting. That is never going to be supplemented by cold obsolete miners sitting in a loft (like mine).
You do not just bring 300 peta-hash out of the cupboard.
And as you say, the 25% group could software tweak the difficulty to compensate, but that would trash their credibility about not making changes.
It would instantly make that chain vulnerable (instant low difficulty) to any fickle miners from the 75% group. A group who would have some incentive to use their own hardware to cause disruption to the laggard group.
If, and it is a *big* if, the non miners were strongly opposed to a change being pushed through by a majority of miners, the change could slowly be rebutted. Economic power to change things is a slow process.
The most likely approach for users and exchanges under that sort of truly contentious change (Eg lifting the 21M max coins), would simply be widespread abandonment of Bitcoin... and maybe not even an uptake of LTC or any other crypto. They all share this sort of issue.
The block limit change is different. If you read the forums and polls taken, you should realise that there is extensive support for some resolution of the capacity limit. There is of course, lots of debate about what change is needed, and how/when to implement it.
I know you recognize the need for a capacity increase. You seem to support using Lightning etc and expect the need to be years away.
That is where we disagree. I think there is sufficient evidence that the transaction load will become critical to users well before Lighting is operational. So we are left with only the choice of relaxing the 1Mb limit, and should focus on which strategy will cause the least problems both now, and later on if the issue arises again.

At least one of his views on Bitcoin is not fine - he has argued for waiting until we really hit congestion during the block limit debate. That could easily cause persistent reputation/branding damage, just as Bitcoin begins to gain some traction and market share. An avoidable problem, unlike some of the other more intractable issues that Bitcoin will face in the future.
And he does not seem to appreciate how much leeway you need to provision when doing capacity planning. I mean both in terms of spare capacity (headroom), and lead time for improving capacity.
We are having a civilized discussion about that issue in [this thread](  ... and I am waiting to  have his feedback about the 0-conf handling ... I am sure he can be more precise than me, about what happens to a Tx that lingers in the mempool, and I want to make sure I understand it clearly.
EDIT. OT for this thread .. but I need to record my thoughts
An example of what I am worrying about just got posted in [this thread](
As I understand it, that Tx (very low fee) will linger in the mempool for some indeterminate time. Just like VISA, both the sender and receiver can see it sitting there with 0-conf.
Unlike VISA, there is no guarantee about whether it will get processed (added to a block), or just dropped. With VISA, once they say "Transaction OK" you have guarantee that it will be processed according to their rules. Their rules are, default action is payment, with possible later charge back. For most retailers etc, that is sufficient to consider the 'deal done'.
For Bitcoin, the rules are, once your Tx is deep enough in the block chain - it is irreversible.   But for most retailers etc, just seeing the 0-conf if there is a mempool backlog, offers no certainty that the Tx will not just be dropped - so at that point they can not consider the 'deal done' - when there is a mempool backlog, they need to get a least 1-conf to be happy the Tx is going to get recorded.
Is that a reasonable understanding of what happens while Bitcoin is operating under a high load situation ?

Ok - there is some dispute over the meaning of *consensus*, but others have covered that.
I am happy to use your term of **supermajority** instead.
I also agree that the non-miners are the economic force in this discussion, but they are not directly in a position to veto a choice that gets implemented by the miners.
I disagree that the commercial incentives favour the 25% miner block, for reasons I already posted.
I have already described the actual result on miners and the other users in a 75/25 hard fork.  But for the record, here it is again. (edited to use *supermajority* rather than consensus)
--------- cut and paste ---------
Everyone seems to miss the affect of the 'difficulty' on mining at the point of a hard fork.
Assume your pool has 25% of the hashpower and the XT **supermajority** is triggered.  They stay mining small blocks and rejecting XT blocks - the chain forks.
Now your pool is mining with a difficulty level set to achieve 10 minute blocks with 100% of the hashpower. But there is only 25% of the hashpower working on this chain... blocks on this chain now average every 40 minutes ... and the re-targeting of difficulty (downwards) will take many weeks.  So suddenly, your pool and any normal users following the small block chain, have a seriously degraded performance in what they see as Bitcoin.
The XT block chain has a similar issue, but with far less degradation - average block time for them drifts to about 13.3 minutes ... and the re-targeting of the difficulty number is much faster (because block production is faster). As a bonus, this chain no longer has any transaction congestion in their blocks.
As confusion rears its head in the consumer and services operations, people will rapidly find out that they can remove the problems they have with their Bitcoin performance, by simply following the XT majority of miners.
And that is what people will do - move en mass to the XT block chain.
Your pool remains free to mine with the old rules, but the coins they mine are not valid at any exchange or user that is following the XT block chain ... and that will very rapidly make them worthless. I am sure you can guess what the your pool will do under those circumstances - upgrade their software.
And for anyone who is not a miner, but wants to have zero impact on their business, it makes a huge amount of sense to switch to the XT (0.11) code base as soon as Mike Hearn releases it.
Why?  
* If the supermajority is NOT reached, you are unaffected.
* If the supermajority IS reached, you are unaffected.
Switching to XT  (0.11) is a zero risk choice.... staying with Bitcoin core means *risking disruption* if a supermajority IS reached.
-------- end cut and paste ----------------
So explain to me, either where I made any error in the above description, or how that scenario gives the 25% miners a commercial advantage?

There is **every** reason to think about messing with the block size limit.
It is called capacity planning. Rolling out a significant change - and a hard fork is about as significant as it gets - needs a fairly long lead time, so that the change can be extensively tested before it kicks in.
If you were working in the IT department of a traditional bank (and I have), and suggested leaving this sort of issue until it caused visible issues for the customers, you would fired for incompetence.
Bitcoin faces the same reliability and capacity management issues as every large scale traditional enterprise does.
If the core developers ignore that, at the expense of their users ... they will get sidelined... and in that situation they should be.
@_date: 2015-07-24 16:10:11
Mike Hearn has already committed that XT (0.11) when available (not 0.11A), will be Bitcoin core, with ONLY the block limit changes.
If the miners lie, so what ... running XT rather than core, will still cope with whatever chaos ensures ... it will accept 1Mb blocks or bigger.  As a non-miner, you will not influence the consensus or lies, but you will be protected from dealing with deciding which is the winning fork.
Your node will still decide that the longest chain is the valid chain .... and follow that.
@_date: 2015-07-10 09:54:43
The &gt;50% hash power is absolute **technical** power. But that is all it is. Bitcoin exists within the real economy, so there is a lot more at work than **technical** power.  In reality, wide acceptance of what they choose to enforce (at a technical level) is also required, otherwise they are destroying their own investment. You are correct if you point out that the *technical* power they have, is not the only power at work here.
I see the miners as custodians and enforcers of the accepted parameters of Bitcoin. The 1Mb limit argument is about how and when to change one of those parameters. The miners are not the only ones with a voice in the discussion, but they *are* the only ones who will enforce whatever is the outcome of that discussion.

Technically there can be a blockchain without Bitcoin .... but it just has some other token instead ... eg. Litecoin ..

@_date: 2015-07-10 05:31:42
Yes they can ... and that would cause an accidental fork ... the fork gets resolved as the chain with the most hashing power gets longer and in terms of Bitcoin's block chain, the longer chain is the valid chain.
If the split is very close to even amounts of hash power, it may remain split for quite a while, and during that period, there would be enormous confusion amongst non mining nodes and SPV wallets.
We actually get splits all the time - usually just one block deep, and because the miners are all using the same rules about what constitutes a valid block, the split gets resolved rapidly and behind the scenes ... orphan blocks.
Where the miners are using conflicting ideas about the protocol (eg &gt;1Mb block maximum) the split would not automatically resolve.
It would be a very public dispute affecting all Bitcoin users ...  either the large block miners would revert their change and lose their blocks from when the split occurred, or the other miners would implement the new code, and discard their version of the chain ... 
During such a split, no doubt the exchange rate would plummet, and no one could trust transactions because you can not predict which chain would win the political battle.
That sort of disaster is why everyone is trying to negotiate the block limit change in advance - to make sure the transition is smooth and  painless.
But make no mistake, the alternative of an abrupt and brutal implementation by a simple &gt;50% of hash power is definitely possible - by design, in the core of the idea behind the block chain, that the longest chain is the valid one. Eventually &gt;50% hash power will always build the longer chain (though it may take a fair while for this to be obvious)
If the protocol change is designed like Gavin's proposal where it only activates when 75% of the mining power agrees, then there would still be the same kind of split, but the chain building would very quickly make it obvious that the new protocol is winning.
For non mining nodes, there is an easier decision. Just implement Gavins patch, and relax. If the change gets triggered, your node blissfully follows the new rules, and if the change is not triggered, your node follows the current chain..  IE. You remain unaffected either way, so non mining nodes (eg exchanges) should definitely switch to XT or add their version of the protocol changes to their node.
Oh ... and if there is a hostile change by &gt;50% of the miners, that causes a fork and crashes the exchange rate, I for one, will buy, buy, buy ... because I remember the accidental fork in March 2013.
[ref: here](
I suspect that a brutal &gt; 50% change causing a fork, would only have a temporary effect on the system, just like that accidental fork. And the politics would suddenly get things done that have been deferred for years. So any massive collapse in the exchange rate would only be temporary - and a huge speculative opportunity.
@_date: 2015-07-10 05:50:53
Yes creating a fork harms Bitcoin - which is why there is a huge incentive to make changes in a smooth and seamless manner.
But:  read the [whitepaper](
At the bottom of page 3... I quote "Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some
nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received, but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof-of-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch to the longer one."
Forks caused by (mining) nodes using differing protocol rules.... like the &gt;1Mb limit are not directly discussed, but are still controlled by the idea that the longest chain is the valid chain. The problem is that unlike the automatic discarding of orphan blocks, this sort of fork only gets resolved by real world politics.... but it can definitely happen, and it is very desirable to avoid.
@_date: 2015-07-23 09:24:24
Those miners were lying about their support of BIP66  ... and when the protocol moved as planned in accordance with BIP66, they caught a cold ... tough ... in the harsh world of &gt;50% consensus (technical level) you can not lie without consequences.
Assume they lie about accepting &gt;1Mb blocks and that change cuts in. They get left on the broken chain..  unless of course the liars have &gt;50% of the hash power, in which case the XT protocol change will not really take effect.
What would then take effect is commercial pressure. You would have a period of serious confusion, while source of failure to change was tracked down (IE Find the liars). During that confusion, you could expect Bitcoin to crash in value (a great buying opportunity), but a very dangerous gamble for miners to take. They are long term players with a huge capital investment, where the ROI is measured in years. To them it is vital that Bitcoin continues to gain acceptance - their business plans all rely on that, so they are the last group in the world that would deliberately sabotage this change. Game it? Of course, but sabotage - no.
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:06:04
This is where we disagree. Although it was nice to see no technical crash under temporary overload conditions, users were being affected.
They will **perceive** that as unreliable.  There is absolutely no need to allow that situation to occur for the predictable level of transactions that are coming soon. Remember that problems flowing from the 1Mb limit colliding with the predictable increase in Tx is an avoidable problem.
I for one do not want to get people driven out of Bitcoin at this very early stage for any avoidable reason.
That would be a PR nightmare, and could relegate Bitcoin to a trivial niche market role.  Most of the better consequences that flow from using a sound money system, require it to become fairly common - and Bitcoin is nowhere near that level of market penetration.

Point 4, is one that is used, but it is wrong ... changing the **limit** will not alter anything immediately.  And the idea that it will encourage centralisation is unproven. Relaxing the limit only removes the prospect of a damaging system overload situation. The estimate of when that risk becomes critical is a matter of debate. 
I do not want to find out the hard way, that other people who expect the capacity problem to be *years away* are wrong.  If we know the cap must be lifted, it is safer (and easier) to do it before the network gets larger.
@_date: 2015-08-01 05:19:38


That is sort of the nub of it...  if you are using fees to manage demand levels, you need RBF or expiring transactions..
In the parallel example of VISA, the sender does not select fee levels (and does not even see them), and never has to pay again if they (and the merchant) see the "Transaction OK" message. *Visa transactions do not expire*
Visa treats the "Transaction OK" message as a commitment to getting the 'confirm' done at some point (often 6+ months later). But they provide sufficient capacity to give that "Transaction Ok" in seconds, and consequently users and merchants complete their trade on the basis of that message.
Bitcoin is taking different approach with 0-conf transactions that expire, and a fee market visible to the sender. Taken together, it means that just sending the transaction is not reliable enough for users and merchants complete their trade on the basis of just submitting the Tx.  When there is no backlog, Bitcoin comes pretty close, but there are difficulties with a self configuring, best effort approach (on the network side) that limit the overall Bitcoin capacity, and that is aside from the arbitrary 1Mb constraint.
I agree that currently Tx's linger far too long. If we keep to that approach that Tx's can expire, then they should at least expire in a predictable way. Random expiry is impossible to map onto user expectations.
If you could have Tx's expire (say) 2 minutes after missing a place in the next block .. it would be more predictable. Not great, but better. On average, 7 minutes later the funds would return to your wallet and you could try again.
Can you comment on my suggestion of having wallets instantly reject a transaction if they assess that it would fail to go through with some configurable time frame at the fee level given?
I know that Core has the calculations done already for  fee levels.... estimates for fee levels to get in within two blocks, or three blocks etc ... 
That could be used in reverse to disallow actually submitting a transaction, with feedback to the user (instant).... message like "The network is too busy to accept your Tx and process it quickly with only **x** fee, you could try **y** fee instead"
I do not really like this, because I am all too aware of the personal limitations of your average consumer. I did last line support for an ISP I created in 1994, and we had 10,000 retail customers. To say that there is very little competence in the wider community is being kind.
Fees that are visible to the sender will often confuse the wider community. That side of things is one of the reasons Visa et.al make them hidden.
The other thing is that the incumbents (Visa, MC) have spent decades fostering the image that there are no fees (I know - they are hidden). Many people re-act vehemently to the idea of paying fees - unless they do not see them.
Still - if fees are the responsibility of the sender, predictable instant feed back is much better than uncertainty.

And nodes that do not follow 99% of the miners producing 2Mb block would almost  never receive blocks. At the current huge difficulty level, the remaining 1% of miners would generate a block about every 1000 minutes.... and that would crush that fork .... their blockchain would effectively stop recording transactions.
Anyone who ran a node following the 1% miners would simply have their commercial activity stopped.
I explained in that thread, the probable result of an attempt to make fundamental change (eg debase currency). What would happen in that case? - the economic base of users would desert those miners (even 99%). They would probably also desert crypto entirely.
I do not argue that miners *should* have ultimate power. I argue that they *do* have ultimate **technical** power, and that the other users hold ultimate **political** power through their choice to  use or ignore Bitcoin.

Ok ... so there are cases where at some unpredictable interval, this sometimes happens with Bitcoin Core.  Btcd and Bitcoinj etc may do other things, but we can say this *sometimes* occurs.
Some else mentioned that it is being made a wallet responsibility to do rebroadcast. I suspect that may be an approach, but perhaps not the best approach.
Make rebroadcast, the responsibility of the node that first accepts a Tx from a wallet... if you get a Tx from another node ... not your problem.
That way SPV wallets, which can not be relied upon to be connected all the time are replaced by what should be a more reliable part of the system - a full node.
Once again, this would be a node *local* issue, and optional but very desirable - that makes it very easy to get rolled out.
I would implement two things ... locally configurable.
* Parameters to allow a node to reject a Tx from wallet, if the node thinks the Tx would be delayed more than xxxx interval (local node policy setting).
* a local DB of wallet Tx entries that were submitted to this node, but are not yet mined into a block.
The node then ensures that the pending transactions it accepted from a wallet (any type), get rebroadcast until they end up mined into a block.This DB would persist across node restarts, but should only be very small unless the network drifts into a huge backlog situation. There is one remaining scenario leaving a Tx loss in this situation. Where a node has a hardware failure that puts the DB out of reach, and/or (for any reason) the node is not restarted. That corner case should be a very rare event.
That would make a 0-conf transaction very nearly the same as a VISA "Transaction Ok" interaction ... but the backend process would ~~very frequently~~ *almost always* be far better - and still much better even when Bitcoin has a backlog under load.
Basically, the fact that nodes randomly drop 0-conf transactions when the user thinks they have been accepted, is much worse than what VISA delivers, even though ultimate settlement times (confirmation) and elimination of charge backs is way better.

It would be good if the 'internal change management' system was a little bit less conservative though.
One of the changes that limit spam was suggested by three years ago and rejected. put that change into LTC and it is one of the reasons LTC is not vulnerable to this attack.
Read about it [here](
If the devs ignore improvements like this, worked out and tested for three years in one of the main alt-coins then they are being too conservative.
The block size limit debate has been just as poorly considered - this is a known issue that is pending, and the limit was explicitly a temporary patch installed with obvious misgivings by Satoshi. Time to bite the bullet and chose a strategy for upward adjustment of that limit.
Oh ... and re-consider the proven anti-spam revision from EDIT: Correct the typo in @_date: 2015-07-31 10:29:53
Thank you for the clarification, especially about block reorganization.
The rebroadcast approach has an obvious weakness with end user SPV wallets. They are very likely to only be intermittently connected to a node, which means they take on the responsibility for rebroadcasting (via a node), and almost certainly will get this aspect wrong at times.
Perhaps the rebroadcast responsibility should be moved to the initial node that accepts a Tx?  Nodes are normally 24/7 these days - wallets may not be.
Equally, nodes can easily keep a reliable DB of Tx they have accepted, but are not yet in the block chain.
It would be a local only DB.... node specific, with fairly trivial storage requirements, just holding a backup of a fragment of the mempool - only transactions pending and entered via this node. Entries get cleared as soon as they are recorded in a mined block.
The DB should be recoverable in the case of node restart - but any decent SQL Db does that,

True - but fees on their own can not solve a capacity problem.
Underlying capacity is one of the current hot issues.
I have a dispute with about professional capacity planning. He is of the view, that at 35% (350kb *average* block size), we have lots of head room and it will be years before it is crunch time.
I contend,  that a system needs capacity to cope with *peak load* - not average load.
Last time we were interacting, I had forgotten the contents of the wiki about Scalability - specifically targets - [here](
I wonder if Luke would like to comment on the decisions made by the capacity planning professionals at VISA.
For business situation of:
* average Tx load of 2000 tp/s
* peak Tx load of 4000 tp/s
they provision a network capacity of **56,000 tp/s** .... which is definitely not cheap, even though their technology (centralised) is inherently less costly than Bitcoin (decentralised).
They leave a **huge** margin of safety in performance, presumably because the business would collapse under reputational damage if they get any serious performance issues.

A big user perception problem gets created by transactions that get held up.
At present, you can submit a transaction, and it may eventually go through, but from a user perspective, if the system is loaded, it would far better to reject a transactions which was likely to be delayed for a long period.
If I am a user who expects about a 10 minute interval for the first confirm, waiting a day with no feedback is a disaster. Much better to reject with a message like "The system is very busy and your transaction would be seriously delayed, so your money has been returned to you. You could re-submit it with a higher fee if you need it to be sent during this busy period"
That approach would leave the fee decision in the hands of the person paying and would not leave them wondering what was happening.
Aside from that. the fee market idea still does not resolve the capacity planning issue.
@_date: 2015-07-29 06:36:42
The original point of the limit was to prevent catastrophic system failures that tend to get provoked in corner cases.... huge block size being an easy way to trigger that sort of problem.
The optimum block limit, is somewhere between a few bytes, and unlimited. 
* a few bytes   = functionally useless
* unlimited = guaranteed to break at some unknown size
So where is the 'right' limit to support the transaction load, and give the *expected* behaviour of 'your transaction goes into the next 10 minute block' - on average of course?
We all also accept that there will be temporary slow ups to.. but they need to be temporary and an exception to normal operation.
When the 1Mb limit was installed (2010?) it was clearly a high enough setting to prevent the second problem, but not cause problems with the first. In other words, a 'good enough' guess.
Now, it is starting to be inappropriate at the usage levels of 2015.

I understand that the mempool is a local thing - and it is replicated but not consistent across nodes, because of network latency and broadcast limitations. (and/or individual node policy on pool size too I guess)
Equally, since it is local, then the node clearly has full control of how it handles things.
It is *indirectly* related to the capacity issue and thus block limit... if Tx are not being mined into blocks, they create a backlog of pending Tx in the (local) mempool
Is the process I describe of nodes dropping a Tx from *their* mempool after some indeterminate interval correct? [yes/no/sometimes]


Bitcoin is being presented as both a currency and a payment network. On the payment network aspect, non technical people IE most of the world, will simply compare them.
Users will not differentiate because of some internal technical differences that are invisible to them. So from that perspective, they *will be treated the same way*.

Users are being told that Bitcoin transactions go through 'almost instantly' and 'almost free' - which when there is no backlog, is true.
But if the backlog persists under load, and we start getting behaviour that as you correctly point out is *working as designed* - but is surprising to end users, I am saying that: **The user perception is most likely to be that Bitcoin is unreliable.**
No matter what the wallet providers do, under backlog conditions, Bitcoin transactions are not always 'almost instant' and 'almost free' .
I have not tried to track down what the probable delay is before a transaction is dropped from the mempool (globally) ... but it seems to be measured in days, based on random variations on how nodes broadcast and rebroadcast pending transactions.
This means that however the wallet provides respond, they will have to take that delay into consideration.
For the poor old user, that delay will generate confusion.
The Tx fee market debate is a bit of a red herring here.  If all the wallets start to bump up fees  automatically, and the network is still operating over the block limit capacity, the mempool will still grow.
Effectively the definition of a **low fee** will shift upwards from zero ... to a much larger number - automatically if wallets are set up to do that.
And the lowest fee transactions - even if that is a big fee in economic terms - will still get dropped. Now *that* escalation will really annoy users. They will see that they paid a big fee (from their viewpoint), but because it was still too low for now very competitive rates in play, their transaction still gets dropped a day or two later.
Fee changes can not correct a situation where the network is running a Tx load that is consistently above the total capacity implicit in the block limit. Under that load you still get a bloated mempool, and transactions get dropped after a fairly large delay. The end user is not expecting transactions to be dropped, days later.
So under load, Bitcoin may be *working as designed* but for an end user, it not working as **expected**.
Re-submitting as per Mycellium, after the Tx being dropped (days later) really generates confusion. I can not quickly find the thread where a Mycellium user pointed out the re-submit, but it was only a day or two ago.
This caused a commercial issue for them. They manually paid their supplier again, with a higher fee, because the bill had to be paid. This happened during the period before the original Tx was dropped from the mempool.
Ok Supplier happy, customer will get goods ... but then the original Tx is dropped and Mycellium re-submits it - and it goes through. So now the supplier has been double paid. The customer is now reliant on getting a refund from the supplier, and is out of pocket until happens.
Auto re-submits, days later, is not good.

Ok ... to handle normal 0-conf Tx and have the same user level confidence that Visa manages, we need to ensure that even if Tx's are delayed a long long time, they are never dropped.
The only players in the network that could offer that guarantee are the miners - and while that would be easy technically, they do not have much incentive to support that. (and it would introduce trust issues)

They made commitments to 8Mb revisions - Gavin has now created a BIP for that...  they do not need to switch to the XT code if the core devs modify the main code base. 
If the core devs stubbornly ignore many people who want the 1Mb limit lifted, the main miners may even fork their own version of a full node - just like XT is a patched version of core code. Everyone is free to roll their own node... but it takes .&gt; 50% of miners using the same protocol, to effect a network wide change.  Most of these discussions are around making revisions smooth and painless - but changes can also occur abruptly, in response to bugs (eg SPV mining) or just a shift in the majority miners view.

Migrate to somewhere with good tax treatment (Singapore?) for one year. Convert BTC to AUD .... then migrate back to Australia. The capital gains event then occurs in the Singapore jurisdiction where the tax rate is 0%
With a 7 figure amount involved, the reduced tax bill will cover at least a year away from Australia (capital gains tax in Oz is *brutal*), and nothing prevents you buying that house remotely on the first day that you become **tax resident** in Singapore.

Exactly how is blockchain.info wrong ?
Oh ... and one other point.  Assume your 350k is a correct number. Is that the average block size?
Some very well informed people .... with a clue if you like... know that capacity planning needs to deal with peak load and in the case of Bitcoin, an individual block production rate that has an uncertainty that follows a Poisson distribution.
You have probably seen [this]( but other may not have. It offers some insight to why you need to keep the capacity of the network well above the *average* load.
A parallel example is capacity planning for Unix system, which I know you are familiar with. You always try to ensure that the elements that provide the system performance never approach more that about 60% utilisation *on average*.  That is just a rough rule of thumb of course, and you can push a lot closer if the work load pattern is not **peaky** ... or you can not even push that close if the work load is very **peaky**.
The Unix example is less complex than Bitcoin, because the system resources are constant in their capacity over each time interval. 
Bitcoin is more uncertain because the block finding interval fluctuates a lot.
That means the resources of the Bitcoin network are not reliably available, and as such you need a bigger percentage of spare capacity if you intend to provide reliable, predictable service. (which explains why you start getting a backlog at about the 200,000 level according to blockchain.info - even if the average load according to your data is 350k per block)
And harking back to the Unix example. We all know that under load, the performance of a system degrades. But it does not degrade smoothly. At some tipping point, performance tails off exponentially ending up very quickly with an utterly unresponsive system. The users see that as a complete failure, even if the system is still grinding along in the background.
EDIT.  I should resist, but your call to group think support needs a reply.
Many hundreds of years ago, you could have been claiming the Earth was flat, and said "almost everyone with a clue on this topic agrees with me" - and that statement would have been true.  You still would have been wrong about the Earth being flat.

This transaction graph .... [here]( .... shows where we are now.
Regularly running at 150,000 .... that 200,000 spike is the recent stress test.
At the 200,000 mark, we start getting a backlog - troubleshooting where the bottleneck occurs under load would help, but an observable fact is that the network starts have a backlog when you hit about 200,000. Not at some calculated point derived from that 350k block size you are using to make your estimate.
I am looking at the issue by *measurement* of reality - not *estimation*.
Look at the graph again .... you can see the growth path, and the trend line shows the network will probably hit the 200,000 level, under normal load, about mid 2016.
That is when we start having capacity problems, and everyone can just look at this graph every week to see how much closer this problem is becoming.
No theoretical calculations needed ... just simply observing the network, and knowing from that stress test, what the level of transactions is that triggers the capacity problem.
Your estimate of *many years* before the problem is triggered, is facing scrutiny by everyone who just monitors things.
I am quite sure that measuring is more reliable than estimating ... but all of us that use Bitcoin can not really afford to run this experiment to destruction, just to educate you to that fact.
Far better for you to concede that an early solution, even one you do not like, is better than a system failure.
On that topic, I have never seen any clear explanation from you,as to why you so strongly oppose what is a minimalist change to resolve this capacity issue.

It should be ..... but GLD and SLV are futures markets.... paper  ... 100:1 fractional reserve, where CB's and their agents use naked shorts to suppress price discovery.
Why - well those markets (pseudo markets really), originally helped remove the problems of trading and settling gold/silver contracts. Physical stuff is hard to verify, secure and transport. So a trusted paper settlement system saved a lot of money by resolving those problems.
Later - by allowing settlement in cash, rather than taking delivery, the whole process has become a sham. And totally corrupt. Yet it is accepted as the way to determine the price of physical gold/silver.  That situation is untenable in the long term, but for the moment that is how it is.
Bitcoin does not need a substitute paper record to help with verification,security and transport. It is trivial to 'take delivery' of Bitcoin, verification is automatic, security is no harder than with GLD records, and transport is builtin.
If the community allows a single (or pair of) leveraged fractional reserve market (like Comex/LBMA) to set the exchange rate, we could end up with the same sort of manipulation by central banks, but at present with such a scattered global, yet integrated group of exchanges, we are seeing true price discovery.
In the current marketplace, the central banks can not use their fiat fire power to intervene to force exchange rates down. They could easily force rates up - but that would be counter productive from their perspective.

No - and if we take Lukes definition - unanimity - then his term of **supermajority** might be a more explicit word.
Although most people use the word consensus to describe how Bitcoin resolves any issues about which fork of the blockchain is valid, it really done by **majority** (of hash power) - not even **supermajority** is needed.
Simple **majority** of hash power &gt;50%, will eventually become the longer chain (Satoshi's paper explains it at the bottom of page 3).
So in a sense, I like that Luke has rearranged this debate by introducing the **supermajority** word. It is probably a more accurate way to describe what is proposed with XT block limit changes.

Agreed - Luke is hardly neutral. Suggesting we wait until there is a regular overload situation is a terrible stance.
It suggests that capacity planning is not needed, and in large scale systems that is a ludicrous idea.
From simply eye balling the transactions graph [here]( and extrapolating, you can see that the normal transaction load will reach about 200,000 by mid 2016.  The spike you can see is the recent stress test ... which loaded up the network to that level.
We know that at about 200,000 transactions, the backlog begins to grow... and that can only be fixed by having more capacity. Luke is saying (above) that using up the 1Mb capacity will probably be decades away.
**Rubbish** - As you can see from the graph, it will probably be in less than a year.
So - the block debate should really just be about the implementation tactics. There should be no debate about the necessity of it - and it needs to be rolled out prior to mid 2016 if we are to avoid a PR disaster.
Lightning will not be operational within that time frame, so it and all the other side chain suggestions are not a solution to this basic capacity problem that is looming. Nice in the future - fine - but not relevant to this capacity problem.

Well there is some controversy and like all design choices, there are alternative approaches. Unfortunately people tend to get very passionate about their preferred design and do not discuss things quietly.
The main sticking point is about using hard fork, or a '95% uptake soft fork'. The choice of strategy here brings a variety of consequences - with both approaches.
There are legitimate concerns about the design strategy of SegWit, all of which flow from it being designed as a soft fork..... a 95% uptake soft fork because of security issues if there is any lower level of uptake (quite correctly laid out in the SegWit documentation).  At 95% uptake, we could risk a hard fork and get the other niggling hangover malleability cases fixed too.
That said, SegWit would be an improvement. I dislike the new transaction format (and the discount of fees) ... but heck.. nothing is perfect. It is just that for a 95% uptake threshold, we could have the same design targets and stick to the current addressing format, rather than forcing things into scripts all the time.
Here is one page of negative review of SegWit: 
and here is Tom Zander with an alternative approach that fixes the couple of spots that SegWit misses.  
In other words, there are other approaches which are different to the SegWit bundle of code, but solve the same issues.
There are choices and there is a lot of noise around this.

If the **limit** is lifted, the average blocks will still only grow from where it currently is.
So 100% of the nodes will still be able to handle the current load. Gradually, poorly connected nodes will be forced to resort to SPV style services only.
But 3x the load also implies about 3x the user base - and 90% of them *will* be in locations that can run nodes.... all things being equal, we should get an increase in nodes.
Maybe...   current number of nodes    **x**  3   **x**  90%  = new number of nodes.
EDIT.  Even in countries with mostly bad connectivity, there will be a few places with a good network - usually in the business centres of the main cities.  They can provide nodes for poorly connected SPV wallets in a hub and spoke arrangement.
That provides access for the unbanked, which I agree is needed for any pervasive uptake of Bitcoin,

You need to build wider consensus if you desire a smooth transition - and I do.
But, the hard truth is that a &gt;50% majority of hash power can force a technical change. In that sort of marginal and disruptive change, there would be lots of fallout. That would need quite some time to recover from and is avoidable.

Manipulated more easily than Bitcoin, because the 'price' is set by futures contracts, where the central banks or their lackeys use naked shorts and 'deliver' in Federal Reserve Notes rather than physical gold.
Bitcoin markets trade in the actual item - not futures or any other derivative, and there is no hint of any central bank involvement.  That makes the Bitcoin markets less manipulated than gold.
However you are right to point out the vastly more extensive community confidence in gold. About 5 billion people are sure it is money - Americans less so, but that has been as a result of propaganda used to confuse them.

And Lightning is currently not quite [vapourware]( but it certainly does not exist in any form that could even begin to alleviate the impending capacity bottleneck.
Proposing it as a solution to the backlog problem (as shown in the recent stress test) is a non starter.
The big argument I am having with is over how long it is likely to be before the network starts to have serious performance degradation.
He seems to think at least several years, which might be long enough to get Lightning deployed. He bases that on a current *average* block size measured at 350k  .... but what really matters is the peak load, and the effect of the very variable block discovery interval. Blocks do not happen *every* 10 minutes ... the interval varies widely. Fairly often blocks arrive slowly, and that reduces the effective max Tx rate to maybe a half of what you would expect, and when blocks arrive faster, they can end up nearly empty.
The result is that while is saying the network is about 35% loaded and that the other 65% should be enough to last for a few years growth, the observable result of the stress test, is that at a load of about 200,000 tx per day [shown here]( we observe backlogs of transactions beginning to impact user experience.
That same chart shows that the 35% loading that is talking about, equates to about 150,000 tx per day. So by simple observation, when the network load gets to about (just a guess) 50% load, or about 500kb of the max 1Mb ... we start to see congestion. That means we are rapidly approaching the **effective** capacity limit - not the theoretical limit.
So the problem is not a few years away. It looks like it will arrive in mid 2016 .... we need a solution *now*.
we need a solution *now* - because it will take a fairly long time to get whatever is chosen, tested and rolled out.
Best guess I have from my large scale systems experience is that you should plan with about a year of lead time, before the new capacity is required. Sometimes you are forced into shorter time scales, but that can go very badly wrong.

Everyone seems to miss the affect of the 'difficulty' on mining at the point of a split.
Assume your pool has 25% of the hashpower and the XT consensus is triggered.  They stay mining small blocks and rejecting large blocks - the chain splits.
Now your pool is mining with a difficulty level set to achieve 10 minute blocks with 100% of the hashpower. But there is only 25% of the hashpower working on this chain... blocks on this chain now average every 40 minutes ... and the re-targeting of difficulty (downwards) will take many weeks.  So suddenly, your pool and any normal users following the small block chain, have a seriously degraded performance in what they see as Bitcoin.
The large block chain has a similar issue, but with far less degradation - average block time for them drifts to about 13.3 minutes ... and the re-targeting of the difficulty number is much faster (because block production is faster). As a bonus, this chain no longer has any transaction congestion in their blocks.
As confusion rears its head in the consumer and services operations, people will rapidly find out that they can remove the problems they have with their Bitcoin performance, by simply following the large block majority of miners.
And that is what people will do - move en mass to the larger block chain.
Your pool remains free to mine with the old rules, but the coins they mine are not valid at any exchange or user that is following the large block chain ... and that will very rapidly make them worthless. I am sure you can guess what the your pool will do under those circumstances - upgrade their software.
And for anyone who is not a miner, but wants to have zero impact on their business, it makes a huge amount of sense to switch to the XT (0.11) code base as soon as Mike releases it.
Why?  
* If the consensus is NOT reached, you are unaffected.
* If the consensus IS reached, you are unaffected.
Switching to XT  (0.11) is a zero risk choice.... staying with Bitcoin core means risking disruption if consensus IS reached.
I have already switched to XT - and if the world get around to a consensus, I will be unaffected.
@_date: 2015-07-31 10:11:41
Ok ... I did misunderstand your view on waiting until we hit congestion. I still *disagree* with you implying we have lots of time left. Specifically, as far as I am concerned, we **are** seeing *early signs* of congestion.
Merchant protocol ... probably sufficient for that use case. But the issues with normal transactions remains for any Tx not done that way.
I understand the problem with wallets that are insensitive to load ... but you have to expect lots of poor software - and some of it will be popular .
Just look at Windows /sarc
If you confine yourself to the 0-conf normal transaction situation (please do not just say 'use another approach' eg merchant protocol), and accept that some users are going to make poor decisions about wallets or fees,,, what is their perception of the system under load? AND how can that be improved.
**Can you confirm that a Tx in the mempool at backlog levels, and with a low fee, may or may not get thrown away, and at an indeterminate interval?**
I see that as the source of confusion in this scenario, and there may be a two pronged approach to dramatically reducing the user impact.  I will elaborate my suggestion if you can confirm that a Tx does get dropped as I described above.
@_date: 2015-07-05 07:03:24
Only miners decide. They are the only ones who *create* new blocks.
Other full nodes will need to be prepared to follow the hash power majority.
I am amazed that people are still confused about this - and the commercial imperative is driven by the effects of the current difficulty level and what a split in hash power means.  What follows is a little thought experiment to try and make the implications clear.
Gavins proposal is based on a *supermajority* of 75% uptake before the protocol  change is triggered.  So think about the network split that occurs at point.
* 25% of the hash power has not upgraded to support protocol change
* 75% of the hash power has upgraded.
The supermajority cuts in and ..... one of the 75% miners generates a big block that the 25% miners reject. The blockchain is now split.
What happens next?
The 25% miners keep supporting their view of the Blockchain and the 75% miners keep supporting their own view.
BUT - you now have both chains with the difficulty level set at a number that assumes 100% of hash power will generate a block every 10 minutes - that is no  longer true on *either* of the Blockchains
* On the 25% hash power chain (with 100% difficulty) you will get blocks about every 40 minutes
* On the 75% hash power chain (with 100% difficulty) you will get blocks about every 13.3 minutes
Clearly the 75% miners have a blockchain that is functioning almost normally, the 25% miners do not.
**Worse**, although the difficulty gets adjusted every 2016 blocks (and then only gradually downwards), it will take much, much longer for the 25% miners chain to adjust the difficulty back to where their chain is generating blocks every 10 minutes. For the 75% miners, the adjustment will be much more rapid, and in the mean time, blocks are just going to be a bit slower and slightly bigger.
What about other nodes, exchanges and SPV wallets - well, if they pick the 25%  chain, they will be getting lousy performance. That chain, with blocks every 40 minutes after the split, ~~will~~may have full blocks almost every block - that would be total overload.
I am certain that the social media coverage will lay all this out within a  couple of hours of such a split, and the only rapid way for any commercial entity  to minimise risk/loss is to move promptly to the 75% chain. The same goes for any passive node. SPV wallets can quickly adjust their settings to point at a node on the 75% chain.
It is a no brainer to simply switch to the patched software well in advance (as an exchange or 
similar) - even if the miners do not move to the larger maximum block size,  running a node that allows for that , just ensures that you will be unaffected if a split occurs at some point in the future.

What? Utter rubbish.  For reliable service levels you must provision sufficient capacity to deal with peak load.
Any system *must* cope with peak load in such a way that the users continue to have an acceptable level of service during those periods.
The wider discussion revolves around what constitutes an **acceptable** minimum level of service for the users. 
In the commercial world (and banks) there is lots of effort put into defining [Service Level Agreements]( People often use the [five nines]( basis for their Service Level Agreement.
That, by definition, means provisioning to achieve proper operation under *peak load* conditions.
I am stunned that you misunderstand this concept.

It all depends where you are tax resident when you convert BTC to AUD (or anything else). 
If you tick the box on the Australian departure card saying that you are a resident departing permanently you become non-resident for taxation purposes until you decide to migrate back (on the arrival form).
You do need to take up tax residence somewhere else .. and I only suggested Singapore because I know that the capital gains tax rate on Bitcoin is zero there.
There may be other approaches that are valid too - but given your lack of records, suggest that being tax resident for a year in a Bitcoin friendly country is the easiest approach.  Do you know where your tax residence is at present? (or are the overseas trips just tourist things)
If you hold money in your own name in an overseas bank account, moving it into Australia is simply moving capital around - it is not income.  But no matter where you bank, Australia wants to know about, and tax you on, income or other taxable events. Selling Bitcoin at a higher exchange rate is a capital gain from the ATO perspective. You can only remove their claim to this by leaving the country and taking up residence in a more tax friendly jurisdiction for a while.

It is open source development - not like it is secret or anything.  And I am not talking about putting your personal financial stuff on a remote data centre. Just run a node there.... point an SPV wallet at it and a few other nodes for regular transactions, and I am sure you use cold storage like every other sane person for anything else.
For development and testing, have a second node (3rd or 4th too) running on testnet ... no real security issues to deal with, and it does fix your bandwidth issue.  IE. Only use the physical access part of security, to cope with things that really do need security (your own funds) - and that basically does not include open source development and testing stuff.
Another way to look at it is: Do not bother with possible security issues where they really are not needed - it just increases you workload for zero benefit.

For end users, many serious issues are invisible. Most of them are not specialist technical people with the expertise to analyse things. Look at the traders in BitcoinMarkets - surprisingly, some of them come out with basic (really basic) questions about Bitcoin fundamentals, yet they are engaged and using Bitcoin directly !
Everyone is irrational at some point on some topics.
Many, many people would take the path of least resistance - the chain with the largest hash power. I know I certainly would, and  I use Bitcoin regularly for a remittance.

Sort of - in this case, existing full nodes that do not upgrade suddenly and silently become *not full nodes* because they do not understand SegWit. So all the new format transactions whilst not 'broken' for these nodes are no longer properly checked by them.
Backwards compatible for SegWit means sliding in a big change and hiding it from nodes that do not upgrade. Essentially, everyone will need to upgrade - which is not a bad thing, but it is exactly what happens with a hard fork. The difference is that the node operator finds out about the change very directly with a hard fork. A soft fork of this magnitude of change creates a risk to people who are not paying attention. These are the software/economic nodes you mention. A hard fork could create disruption for them, but never a hidden loss by relying on the presumption that they are running a full node, even though the soft fork has downgraded them to a partial node that does not understand SegWit.


Malleability - is quite relevant when that is one of the goals of the design change, and SegWit misses a bit - the soft fork approach mandates this. Alternative designs solve the problem completely - but need the 100% uptake that a hard fork guarantees. So it is a design choice to make and should be  measured against the completeness of the proposed solution.
The address format thing is more a people issue. I know how hard it is to get non-technical people to cope with public/private keys. Explaining scripts make that task harder, so if there is a design approach to solving the issues at hand, without adding to the user education problem, that is an approach with benefits. Currently, scripts are very optional, and used primarily for multi-sig use cases. With SegWit, they become mandatory if you need the other benefits SegWit brings.
Simplest example I can think of is paper wallets - nicely supported with the original address format(s), but still waiting development for SegWit scripts. A part of the SegWit solution that is pending.
So changing address formats has *lots* of impact on all wallets - a major change that will certainly cause some user issues. Not entirely a good choice if there is another approach that avoids the whole problem.
As I said earlier, there are other design options. The choice between approaches is not obvious or clear cut.

Just because the USD is used to settle more international trade than any other currency (hence called the reserve currency), does not make it universally accepted.
In most of the world outside the USA, you can not buy goods and services or pay government fees or fines using USD.
You can usually convert USD to the local currency fairly easily - though once again not always either conveniently or at a reasonable exchange rate.
USD is not (directly) universally accepted. It is not accepted as payment for my coffee or newspaper in the morning - and I am in London ! - financial capital of the world.

I need to catch up with my reading of lightning-dev mailing list, but as at a few weeks ago, the routing/multi endpoint stuff was still an experimental *design in progress* - lots of genuinely difficult things to resolve there. That makes people relying on Lightning for this aspect a bit optimistic in my view. Maybe this will all be fait acompli in a year or two, but at the moment it is not a tested and functioning system.
That said, what I am really saying is being under-considered, is that people are pretty reluctant to put money up front. Just human nature. And Visa allows the same sort of functionality, and speed as L2 systems, but does not need money up front, and allows complaint resolution (at a price). So L2 systems face an uphill battle for mind share here.

Remmitances are already easy with Bitcoin if you are tech savvy. And only one end of the person to person remittance paid needs to be tech savvy. Usually the sender.
I will put the from the view of the sender. Usually someone earn USD, EUR, GBP etc.... and sending to someone in the Philipines, Thailand, South America or Africa.  I will use the GBP-&gt;THB situation.
You need an account at one or more Bitcoin exchanges that trades GBP-&gt;BTC
You also need an account at a Bitcoin exchange that trade BTC=&gt;THB.  Preferably one that includes either deposit to local bank account (bill paying service) or cash pick arrangements.
I have an old post about a fully worked example 
I do know that my same example works fine for the Pillipines, but I have not tried to find end point billpayer BTC companies in other countries. Perhaps other people can help there. (AUD has support via their pBay system)
In essence, some remittance corridors are very well supported by WU and Moneygram, In others they are total rippoffs. If the one you need to use is a ripoff, explore using using Bitcoin as I outlined in my old article.
The subtle distinction is that neither of the two BTC exchanges does an international money transfer. They operate on simple BTC/Local currency basis. In many countries that means a lot of KCL/AML rules related to being a money transmitter do not apply, and that make the exchange's task much simpler.
FYI.  That worked example corridor is still being used every week  - it still works nicely a year later.

Sometimes a hard fork is essential - some changes (and/or bug fixes) simply can not be done any other way.
That said, reducing the risk of a chain split *must be a priority*, and the usual way to do that, is to schedule any hard fork a **long way** into the future. Several versions of the software later at least. That way, almost everyone will have already installed the required upgraded software well before the fork kicks in.
Imagine if Core had included, three releases ago, a minor relaxation of the block size limit, and made that relaxation contingent on being a large number of blocks into the future, plus the activation of the CTLV and SegWit changes.
It would not have activated yet, but everyone would know what was coming. All the aggravation we have seen, would simply not be there. There would still be arguments about how the limit was being relaxed, and maybe more subtle ideas like BU would be passionately argued, but there would be a concrete plan in place. It could even be adjusted or revised if a better approach was found.
Planning matters.
Speaking of revised or possibly better approaches to scaling, I am still trying to fully get my head around [this]( idea.
It seems to be based on exploiting the fact that mining has already become centralised, and that means  that the other parts of the system can take a very different approach to the one currently in use, without making the situation worse. The suggestion (if valid) shows a path to massive scaling of the non miner elements without the network impact of the current 'broadcast everything' design.
An interesting idea - and if I understand it correctly, it can be built and tested live without impacting any of the existing nodes or wallets. That means it could be gradually converted over to, if it works.

Anyone who does not follow the &gt;51% hashrate is following a coin with a security hole. And people will do that I am sure. However, anyone who thinks it through and is not mining will switch pretty quickly to the chain secured by the majority hash rate. You can count on the web wallets and exchanges to switch quickly.

Making any HF safe is pretty simple - put in the activation code so that the HF occurs a **long** way into the future. AND publicise it widely/repeatedly.
That way, a huge percentage of the nodes (and the other code bases) will support just through the timing of their normal software updates.
The problem Core has is that they are leaving the lead time pretty tight - that increases the risk of a chain split. They could have accepted an design limit increase a year ago and put the activation code into 12.x or similar. Made it contingent on already deploying CTLV and Segwit etc.... and everyone would already be set up to cope with it.
It is called planning.

@_date: 2016-09-16 09:59:24
Lightning (and other L2 systems) support a different sort of interaction model to native Bitcoin. One that directly competes with Visa and will almost certainly take quite a while to get any serious uptake.
One weakness I see that other people do not seem to comment on, is the need to commit funds up front so that you are able to open payment channels. Ok, those funds are never at risk because the design allows for all the error/fraud cases, but you still need to commit funds before you can make transactions.
I suspect that most people will see that as a real issue which limits how much uptake there will be. Sort of like I avoid leaving much in the way of funds with PayPal ... I just prefer to leave my resources available for adhoc usage - which native Bitcoin transactions do imply. You do not pre-commit anything before making an ordinary Bitcoin transaction. 
Visa is the same - you do not have any pre-allocated amount of your own money. You have a credit limit and Visa chases you later for payment. That model is the competition for Lightning, and I am afraid to say, the incumbent (Visa) has a real advantage here.
@_date: 2016-09-21 13:09:30
The SegWit increase (which can be real) relies on the uptake of it - across many nodes.
Eg If only 20% of the Tx generated by nodes (aka wallets) use it, then the maximum improvement is (about) 20% of the theoretical available increase.
So - this capacity increase will only happen slowly as adoption of SegWit occurs.

Bahh ..... 'permissioned' blockchain ....  that is just another way to say a distributed database system supporting a centralised (permissioned) management of data. And you do not need a blockchain approach for that. In fact vastly more efficient tools already exist for that problem space.  The author is right about one thing though, that solution does not need a token ... never has
Bitcoin is all about decentralised access to a consensus about a shared ledger. A completely different problem space, and one where that 'token' is integral to solving the problem.

- withdraw DASH/LTC/NMC from Exchange  to new account at Exchange

Not mentioned in that article. But different use cases demand different choices.
For some like  the public Bitcoin blockchain is fine.

But only until about July 2016 ....  then the halving knocks that back a lot (about 4% money supply growth then)
And then about 2020 it goes back to about 1% money supply growth.
As long as utilisation of BTC as a currency grows at a rate to match or exceed the money supply growth, the position reverses and you get an increasing value as measured by the exchange rates (commonly misstated as 'price')

I will refute part of that statement. 
It actually costs more in the UK to send money via Western Union from your bank account than it does to send cash.
Specific example.
GBP 200 to THB -  cash fee GBP 12.90,  online fee GBP 14.90: So GBP 2.00 MORE to send using online system
Probably a Visa charge being added .... but it is a real extra cost which is the exact opposite what is suggested by the OP.

Cold storage ... and a trivial amount on your phone is a reasonable compromise.
Cold storage in multiple varying amounts .... eg.  2, 5, 10, 20 BTC .... I would use paper ... (one time usage only for each paper address) and then you can sweep whatever value you need into your phone when you need it.
Buy from your preferred exchange, and move immediately to a new cold storage paper wallet to set this up.
The only funds at risk is the small amount you keep on your phone.  but be careful how you protect those paper wallets ...
@_date: 2017-09-27 08:13:27


You are of course entitled to your view, but I would point out that it is the opposite of what Satoshi proposed.
From line 1 of the whitepaper:   (emphasis in italics is mine)
"**Abstract.** A purely peer-to-peer version of *electronic cash* would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution"
Your point about hard forks is a good one though. Several other coins such as DASH use regular planned hard forks to eliminate most of the controversy about them. The remaining controversy then becomes about what features are changing in that fork.
@_date: 2015-04-28 11:44:14
How about ....  all via tor
- create oneshot email
- create oneshot btc-e account for that email
- move BTC to btc-e account
- immediate sell to USD
- immediate buy from USD
- immediate withdraw in smaller (random chunks) to new paper wallet(s)
- forget email and btc-e account
In this instance, btc-e acts as a 'tumbler'  ... the BTC that get extracted, are not the BTC that were originally owned.
After that, move to other exchange(s) and do the same thing as many times as you feel to be needed to break the chain.
Eventually, fund a small number of BTC from one of the outputs, to  a real account in the real identity of Satoshi and trade for USD, GBP, YEN etc ...as needed.
Obviously this can only work for small amounts ..... but hey --- it is all cashflow.
Do it at random times repeatedly and scatter the funds to the four winds as far as the world can trace.

 ... about a different motive.... but still about Bitcoin replacing the centralized and corruptible settlement network(s)...   it already easily replaces the correspondent bank network(s) for remittances.
see my post about that
So Bitcoin is gradually becoming the 'plumbing' underneath international settlements of some types.   It is a natural for that use case - because it avoids the need to have established trust in place between remote parties.  That makes it a substantially better solution for the international settlement problem.
You only need to deal with your end of the problem ... not both ends of a 'trust' arrangement across cultures and political systems.
That dramatically reduces frictions and the associated costs.

Perhaps not.  If the full node network itself is large and heterogeneous in nature, then that core network is statistically incorruptible. That remains true, even if a much larger number of secondary participants (SPV and similar) choose to put themselves at risk.
So you could have a node network of perhaps 20,000 players scattered in 160 jursidications, and 100 million other users who 'trust' the integrity of that network.  Not as safe as a node network of 1 million with 100 million secondary users, but probably safe enough as long as anyone is free to commission their own node at will.
Of note, we already have about 6000 nodes supporting perhaps 1 million users ... as long as growth of usage stays near that ratio I think you can say it remains decentralized enough that attacks are limited to state level actors.

Better yet, extend the Namecoin capabilities and inherit the security that comes from the fact is it merge mined by a big slice of the Bitcoin miners hardware.
Namecoin has the 2nd largest hardware security ... the best of all the alt coins.  AND it is both easier to suggest changes and more in need of developer resources than Bitcoin.
As a key based data store system, it could offer the perfect pre-existing place to put this 'stock exchange' data ....  a new sub key perhaps - stk/ rather than /d  (domains)   /u etc

True - but they need to be persistent for 210000 blocks ... if they do that, then the network really does need the increase ... then they need to do it again for the next 210000 blocks.... and so on.
So the economics work against gaming the algorithm for any sustained period, and any attack that floods the network persistently, will force low bandwidth participants out anyway - regardless of any increased limit (by any formula) or not.
Imagine someone spamming the current network to above 250k transactions for two years ... ok, they need to buy some Bitcoins to sustain that, but a government could easily buy slowly every day, just enough to sustain this attack - and they print their fiat for nothing, so this attack would cost a government nothing.
Spam the network for too long, and Bitcoin dies. Even the fee market concept fails to prevent this. Individuals can not simply increase their fees to any level - a government attacker can, and so a government can just keep forcing the other users transactions out of service. A government attack, could destroy the utility of the system for a sustained period - that would probably kill it.
Fortunately, it appears that governments either do not see Bitcoin as a threat, or see an opportunity to co-opt it for a cashless society - with strong tracking and hence taxation advantages to them. Many well connected people are also now understanding the genuine advantages that the blockchain technology can deliver to moribund but essential parts of our finance system. 
So there is also an incentive to generate a supportive view of all things blockchain - and that indirectly includes Bitcoin. You have probably noticed the shift in the propaganda slant in this direction in the MSM.
It means that even if volume growth forces the gradual centralisation of the validating and mining nodes, Bitcoin will still remain viable (useful to governments, hence supported, or at least ignored, by them) - and for the libertarian minority in the world, there will always be privacy solutions layered around the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-04-24 08:39:40
'price' - more accurately 'exchange rate' - matters in one simple way. At the current rate, Bitcoin is restricted in the size (value wise) of the transactions it can support for settlement.
Sure, you can buy a cup of coffee, or even a car as an amount of value without stressing the stability of the exchange rate.
But try and settle something like the purchase of those two French ships that were built for the russians??   USD value - about a billion...  
To do that you need to acquire and send approx 4.4 million Bitcions .... there are probably not that many available ... certainly not at the USD 230 exchange rate. 
Try to buy that many, and you will sky rocket the exchange rate.
So Bitcoin - at the current exchange rate - can not handle large scale global trade settlements ... just like if gold was $200 a tonne ... it would be useless at backing world trade.   Even the current gold 'price' of about $1200 per Ounce (not tonne) is not really an appropriate level for it to be used to back international trade settlements.  
So before Bitcoin can shift up a gear into the larger financial markets, it needs to be re-priced upwards dramatically.  Hopefully, this will happen.

This relates to trying to allowing wallets to extend into really poor bandwidth environments. Because of the inevitable bandwidth needs of a validating node, **L**ow**R**esource Wallets will need to be wholly trusting of some node or set of nodes.
That will remain the only solution for many third world environments, and for the unbanked of the west (with only a cheap cell phone).

The multi country part is key - it addresses (partly) the possibility of government interference.
Bitcoin is permissionless at present ... because anyone in any country can set up a node and it is automatically a peer. Of equal value to all other nodes on the network.
Centralisation, to a level where real world pressure by governments can force alterations to the protocol, is the threat.
Where is that level?
As long as it remains impossible for one government or hegemon to coerce the protocol, we are fine. At least 50% (hash power) of the mining nodes need to outside the influence of any particular global alliance of governments.
China presents a concern at present, but that can be countered by adding mining support in other jurisdictions. A hash power war if you like. Akin to currency wars.
So mining centralisation always has a counter strategy that can not be removed - good.
Validating node centralisation is correlated to the needed bandwidth to support the transaction load - always will be. As usage grows, nodes become less and less viable for home users. But as long as it remains possible for anyone with commercial grade bandwidth, then we will probably have enough self interested players to ensure thousands of nodes in geographically dispersed locations continue to exist.

It is also about the code. If you do not have the code to review and test, you are just waffling...  Anyone can sprout fine sounding ideas. Building stuff that works is quite different.  It is a case of put up or shut up.
At present, we have one available solution to the block size limit - BIP101 - coded and working if required. I am thankful that exists. If we do suddenly hit the capacity limit (Eg. Fidelity turns on their stuff), then at least one solution is available off the shelf.
All the other talking - analysis paralysis if you ask me - has not provided a second alternative. So good bad or indifferent, BIP101 it is unless someone provides working, tested code for something else.

Phone wallets should be treated as vulnerable - especially to theft or loss. Just like your physical wallet.
So - just keep a modest amount in your phone. You would not carry around your life savings (fiat) in a leather wallet would you !
Keep the rest of your BTC in multiple small amount cold storage (paper?) wallets. Eg 1/5/10/50 BTC in each cold storage address. Then shift them to your phone whenever you need to top it up.
(You can split up larger lumps as required if you run out of smaller the smaller pots)
Keep track of the public addresses in an encrypted spreadsheet ... You can always check the amounts at each address with a block explorer. (keep it encrypted at all times)
Back up the encrypted spreadsheet  - even by emailing it to yourself via gmail/hotmail or similar.

If DB crashes it will probably trigger a worldwide financial meltdown.
That would typically induce a massive crash in equity values and real estate values.
During such savage deflation, many people get forced to sell truly liquid assets like Gold, Silver and Bitcoin to pay for other more urgent expenses. That means the price of these assets collapse too (in fiat terms) - but anyone prepared for this process, puts some fiat resources aside to sweep up hard assets at fire sale prices.
When the system inevitably begins to recover in a year or so, the asset prices of gold/silver/bitcoin should recover well ahead of stocks, bonds and real estate.

Gold has a major advantage over Bitcoin. It is **widely** held and understood by people around the world - India and China in particular.
Bitcoin is only held by a very tiny portion of the worlds population. For store of value as the primary use case, it would need to be held by many more people, and to get to that situation, it needs to be used for trading/transactions (like gold used to be for &gt; 5000 years).  The upper limit on Tx throughput is hampering that gradual adoption process.
@_date: 2016-10-02 08:49:31
It can only go on indefinitely if there is indefinite growth of sufficient magnitude to cover the running costs (interest). That is problematic. If there is insufficient growth for a long enough interval (years) it can reverse suddenly and become a death spiral of economic collapse.
Suprisingly the argument that 'infinite growth on a finite planet must fail' is wrong. People using that argument are assuming that the physical resources of the planet are the only resources.
The other apparently unbounded resource is our inventiveness. That has been an engine of growth through the centuries and has really accelerated since the industrial revolution. Maybe that will continue.
@_date: 2016-10-16 11:23:00
You are confusing Bitcoin scarcity with Transaction Slot scarcity.
Increasing the throughput capacity does **not** alter Bitcoin scarcity.
Decreasing capacity or allowing it to hit the artificial 1Mb limit creates monetary velocity constraints. (friction from fee wars also reduces monetary velocity). In Fiat systems actively reducing monetary velocity (by reigning in credit) leads to 'busts' in market activity ..... so if the capacity issue is not resolved for too long a period, it probably will lead to Mike Hearns claim of 'failed experiment' being self fulfilling.

I strongly feel we need every capacity increase approach that is possible - all at the same time. Different tactics have different profiles of increase, and risk.
* SegWit; Some capacity increase but needs reworking of wallets which leads to slow deployment, but also improves some part of network costs
* Lift Block Limit: Direct capacity increase, but to de-risk the chain splits issue it should be scheduled well in advance of activation, and needs other validation changes to prevent the quadratic attack.
* 2nd layer: Provides solutions to some use cases that can never scale directly on the block chain, but in practical  terms will not reduce the Tx load, but only slow the increase in Tx load - and not for a few years yet.
You can see from the above items, it should NOT be seen as an either/or scenario. All the capacity solutions are needed and will operate side by side - and even then, I suspect we will need other ways to increase the capacity of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-15 10:00:02

Good thought - but zillions will be the easiest to crack first.  And anyone attacking will still be adding to the database. But that also costs resources. All security problems are a resources battle. This is no different. If you want to use a brain wallet for a very short time, you should still try to use a really difficult one.
If you use 'fred' as your brain wallet, and move funds to it, you are an idiot.
No matter how you use brain wallets they are still higher risk than truly random addresses - but as long as you work hard to make them quite difficult, they may be useful, on a short term basis for some task at hand - and with some risk.
That said - I do not use them myself.

But it does have to be widely held to be **liquid** and valuable for it to be a good store of value. I held shares for over 10 years that were very valuable, but illiquid - they could not in any way be
 used as a currency, and although they did store value for me, because they were illiquid, I could not draw on that asset at times when I needed to. That makes valuable things that are illiquid poor choices for store of value.
Physical gold and silver are widely held, and liquid, with no counter party risk - that has made them the best choice for store of value for thousands of years.
Bitcoin has no counter party risk, and is moderately liquid, but liquidity is limited by the fact that it is not widely held. More ordinary trade/transactions would change that over time, and produce a much stronger way to support the store of value use case for Bitcoin. What is limiting the ordinary Tx usage? The artificial capacity limit.

That is another tactic that works..  I am just pointing out that there is at least one (transitory) way of using brain wallets which is valid.
Personally, I do not use brain wallets. PGP encrypted emails of keys are a rather safe way to store keys. Not entirely safe - you need to have confidence that your computer is not compromised, and that your location is not under strong surveillance (video of keystrokes or soft keyboard) while using your PGP pass phrase.
Another risk reduction tactic is to use many Bitcoin addresses - spread the risk, at the cost of a tiny increase in transactions costs.

They are a risky thing - but have one very good use case - hiding from official persecution. The simplest example being the risk of having assets confiscated while crossing a border. 
You could use a brain wallet (with it's very definite risk) for the **short period** that you need to cross a border carrying zero evidence of your wealth.  While your bitcoins are in that address you are at risk of being brute forced - but that may be a lower risk than the one posed by ~~armed thugs~~ officials.

is correct in his post above... humans are rubbish at randomness. So using a brainwallet is not safe in any long term sense. The other attribute of being completely invisible is however, useful.
So if you take a risk of the brute force attack against a brain wallet, because you need the invisibility, you should only use that wallet for the minimum duration possible for your situation. That way you reduce (but do not eliminate) the chance of a brute force attack.
Eg.  If you use a brain wallet for 5 years .... there is huge risk that you will hacked, but if you use a brain wallet for only 30 minutes - the risk is a lot lower, because the window of opportunity for the attacker is much smaller.
There is still a risk.

Your experiment just proves what I was saying earlier - brain wallets will get cracked - over time.
If you have a longer key, you push the estimate for how long it survives being brute forced, but if there are more attackers, the estimate for how long it survives goes down.
As the value of Bitcoin goes up, you can definitely assume the number of attackers will go up. That is a big negative.
Brain wallets will become less and less secure as they become more and more valuable targets.
They can still have a use - but only for short intervals and only where you do accept that there is still a risk, but the risk is worth taking for some other reason.

Bitcoin Core alone does not achieve this. You need to run a full node and a block explorer database with some sort of web interface as well to replicate this capability on your own server.

For completeness, I should point out the you can do this by using the Bitcoin Core software or many other versions of node software - in particular all the variants that are derived for the Core code base, such as Classic, XT and Unlimited should work.

21 Million is the upper bound - available BTC will always be a lower number.
It looks increasingly likely that the estimated 1M Satoshi coins will never move, based on the possibility that Satoshi was actually David Kleiman.
(For detailed discussion see [here](
Add to that the other coins lost in old wallets, deceased estates where the private key is lost, and those sent to unused addresses in error or deliberately *burnt*.
So the available M1 for Bitcoin is unlikely to be beyond (at a guess) 18M coins in the foreseeable future.

And SegWit transactions get a 75% discount of fees compared to current transactions, so miners have a financial incentive to prevent SegWit from being deployed.
To maximise their fee income, they need a slowly growing maximum block size with a fairly high backlog of transactions. Slowly growing, so that uptake of Bitcoin usage does not get stalled. There is some optimum increase rate of the block size limit to maximise mining revenue that is probably similar to the [Laffer curve]( 
None of the code bases currently suggest this sort of growth of capacity strategy.

I explained how you can make it better.
Set up the existing ebuilds to install the default bitcoin-core code (no patches) - that is what everyone expects them to do - with optional stuff if explicitly enabled.
Create a 2nd pair of ebuilds with a name that clearly implies that you are extending the software in some way.  The best example is the kernel sources which take exactly that approach.
That approach avoids the confusion that you keep creating with your approach.
And it is trivial to implement !!
Ohh ... and for the record, the new BITCOIN_POLICY variable has a default value of  "cpfp dcmp -rbf spamfilter" - that turns your patches on for bitcoin-qt.
For bitcoind the defaults are: USE="bitcoin_policy_cpfp bitcoin_policy_dcmp examples ljr logrotate upnp wallet -bitcoin_policy_rbf -bitcoin_policy_spamfilter {-test} -xt -zeromq"
So for both of these.. your are defaulting to ON for your patches.
@_date: 2015-02-27 11:07:50
You have had all the arguments in bugs raised against you ...
Try listening.  Gentoo, **normally** compiles the upstream software without patches, unless you deliberately enable extra USE flags or other variables. Most of us rely on that behaviour to reduce our workload in software maintenance.
Your approach is contrary to this... and confuses many experienced Gentoo users.... 
Introducing confusion, and continuing in the face of clear complaints - which is what you are doing - shows a poor understanding of what your fellow developers expect.
I know now, that I need to do a detailed review of anything you control - so I will just block all your stuff from now on, and roll my own.  That will cause me less work, and no surprises.
I might even set up an overlay with:
* net-p2p/vanilla-bitcoind
* net-p2p/vanilla-bitcoin-qt
Your 'skill' as a maintainer is not irreplaceable - and given the level of confusion you persist in creating, not very valuable to quite a number of people. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 10:56:34
I suspect I was not clear enough.
The very names of the ebuilds  
* net-p2p/bitcoind
* net-p2p/bitcoin-qt
plus the fact that they are the only bitcoin ebuilds in the basic portage library implies to many people, that they are (by default) the bitcoin-core software.
That is what gives the impression that the default install will give an unmodified compile of the upstream source. It is what all the other packages do where possible.
Patches, revisions etc ... come in the form of non-default flags, or clearly non standard names.
@_date: 2015-02-27 10:33:12
I do not expect the USE flags to keep getting revised in a simple version upgrade, to **silently** reinstate patches, that I have already set the flags to avoid.
Worse... the QT client now uses a new variable .to sneak in those patches ... no warning there.
Luke is being **deceptive** in his strategy - and it has cost me valuable time to cope with his (repeated) changes.   Everyone else is affected the same way....
@_date: 2015-02-27 10:16:51
Not a troll.
Just pissed off that you enable by default, a set of patches that you like.... while the impression given is that the version in portage is the default bitcoin code.
I have no problem with you providing the patches, just with silently enabling them.
That IS deceptive.  I had to trawl around for half an hour to see what you had done - again. And the approach has changed too  ... a couple of new USE flags which are on by default, and a BITCOIN_POLICY variable with defaults that work away from the version on github.
I ended up installing your version - then noticing the extra log messages, then researching what you have done, then adjusting the USE and policy settings to get things to revert to the github approac, and then had to recompile the software and restart it.
**All in all, your deceptive strategy cost me a morning's effort - again.**
I wonder how many other people's time you will waste with this lousy approach.
If you really want to have your defaults done as an easy approach, why not create:
*  net-p2p/bitcoind
*  net-p2p/bitcoin-qt
*  net-p2p/bitcoind-antispam   (the setup with your patches)
*  net-p2p/bitcoin-qt-antispam (the setup with you patches)
That would be clearer in intent ...  just like we have
*  sys-kernel/vanilla-sources
*  sys-kernel/gentoo-sources
People install whichever kernel style they want - but they are not deceived into taking patches outside the core kernel published by Linus

Centralised systems are always technically more 'efficient' by CPU cycles required, electricity and capex measure .... BUT they always introduce the need to trust a 3rd party. A counter party risk.

And by exchange rate(s) I do not just mean BTC/USD .... I mean that plus, BTC/gold,  BTC/Oil, BTC/wheat etc ....
So I expect there to be, fiat currencies, precious metals (gold/silver) as currencies, Bitcoin (and maybe other cryptos), barter and private money system's like Visa, Western Union, Paypal where those systems nominally use fiat, but internally use their own ledgers ... IE Off-chain from the fiat masters (Central banks)

So far pretty normal - slow, but given that huge interval with no blocks being found, understandable.
The problem this exposed is that the receiving site, saw my 0-conf Tx in the mempool (happy) ... but it failed to get into the blockchain within whatever interval they consider reasonable..and got marked a 'timed out'
This creates an issue where I have sent money, but the other end may not recognize that it arrived later than expected.
Clearly, Bitcoin at least leaves a nice visible audit trail, so support at the other end can resolve things. In this particular site, it seems they must have encountered this before, because eventually, their site automatically noticed the confirms and proceeded normally. A good thing too - Thailand is on holiday today and support is not working today.
I wonder how many other businesses will deal nicely with this problem. In this case a huge block interval triggered it, but a large backlog in the mempool would do the same thing.
This sort of highlights the issue of *unpredictable* behaviour with 0-conf transactions in the mempool.
A possible improvement would be something like:
* 0-conf transactions NOT included within 144 blocks from the moment they are entered get **dropped** by all nodes and not mined
That would give a nice predictable 24 hours (approx) limit to how long funds could be pending from your wallet, before either they get recorded, or get returned to you. The currently random point in time where a Tx might get dropped is pretty bad for any unfortunate user who encounters the issue - for whatever reason.

And I disagree with you in this specific use case.
A simple encrypted key .... still provides an attack vector if it is on your person. You are flat out wrong to say '*No amount of searching will turn it up.*' - it might be found.
Perhaps that is a remote possibility, but it is still a possibility. PLUS - assume it is elegantly hidden in (say) a page of paperback you have with you - and that gets confiscated. Then you have lost your stash, even if the officials do not find it.
At least with a brain wallet, there is nothing to be lost or confiscated.
A brain wallet is still fairly poor as anything except as a very short term storage location, precisely because of the brute force attack vector, but that may be the least risky tactic for the short duration of avoiding interference from officialdom.
For avoidance of doubt. I totally agree with you that brain wallets are *not safe* - and that people are rubbish at randomness. Why? 
In a past life (about 30 years ago), I built a subsystem to generate random numbers sets for the ANZ bank in Australia. I had to learn all about randomness. The solution? Use a hardware Chekov Radiation collector - and fling out numbers based on that - truly random.

I did not talk about the security of phones - the stuff you mention is fine. But they *are* very vulnerable to theft or loss. I am forever helping friends at my local pub who have had phones lost or stolen. Or just 'upgraded' by the phone shop, and they gave the shop their old phone. They usually lose their contact list and photos ... despite me hounding them about having backups on many occasions in the past.

The receiver may not need to do the local conversion...  it depends on the country.
In Thailand there is one broker (coins.co.th) that I experimented with as a comparison to using Western Union. They allow THB pickup at 7-Eleven (and lots of other arrangements too)
The example here is:   GBP -&gt; THB
£200 to be sent, has a £14.90 fee added by Western Union.  Money sent ended up as 9446THB received. Cash pickup from WU
The alternative approach was to send £214.90 worth of BTC, and the amount received was 10750THB though that site   .... almost 1300THB better for the recipient (~10%)
Limited to 5000THB pickup at a time, and I split it across a few payment methods including THB into a local bank ... those numbers are after the tiny pickup fee applied by 7-Eleven and the local bank.
And the local person, does NOT need to understand Bitcoin.
I did the BTC send and nominated the THB collection method.
A similar service is available in the the Philipines.
EDIT:  Takes 3 confirms before you get the release code for the local currency. Service is limited to local Thai business hours. (make the request any time, but it only gets converted to THB during Thai business hours)

Bloat I agree with. And as usual Luke-jr is waffling.
Clearly the alt-coins are gaining market share, though a lot of that is just random speculation, but a few of the projects try to address areas of monetary weakness in Bitcoin (privacy and the true fungibility that allows), and DASH also addresses the social issue of project governance, and adds strong incentives for decentralisation.  XMR and ZSASH do not tackle that area. I was surprised to find there are now over 6000 DASH node - and rising - all because of those ($$$) incentives.
If you also add the DASH (actually operational) 'Instant Send' feature, you reduce the need for an LN type extension (though that remains possible).
My guess is that some of these fundamentals will become more widely understood over time, and DASH (and XMR) will be some of the projects that take a decent slice of the Bitcoin user/business basis.

Lightning by definition *increases* the number of onchain transactions - just not as quickly. Each 'settlement' is an onchain transaction and for long running business style partner connections (the ones where LN offer good optimisation) you get one onchain transaction per day, per settlement path. That will add up quickly as LN gets any uptake. And that is in addition to the current load.

Facetious and incomplete reply Luke. Because of the 71 inputs, it will cost him the 85$ to move it to where he can convert to fiat, and then the fiat charges as well to move it to where he really wants to send it. 
So your suggestion is even more expensive.

Some existing node owners will stop running their nodes.... BUT the increased transaction capacity will allow a lot more people to use Bitcoin, and a percentage of those new users will start to run new nodes. No one knows which way that will balance out ... there may be an increase overall in nodes, or a decrease - only time will tell.

Completely legal in some places, the state of Victoria in Australia for example.
I was about 20 at the time when it was legalised. The overall effect was a reduction in the number of brothels by 2/3rds .... so all the people who have morality issues with prostitution and want to reduce it, should be in favour of legalisation - because that is the only known way to reduce (1) the level of prostitution in a community, (2) the harm done to sex workers, and (3) the drug and health issues associated with prohibition techniques.
