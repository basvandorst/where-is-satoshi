The reason I'm asking is I'm running a full node at home using an old laptop. The uptime is probably not as good as a VPS but it's still good. And I don't see how that last 0.1% uptime could make such a difference to the network. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 19:42:34
Out of curiosity, how is a home run server not reliable? 
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:57:48
There is most certainly only a small minority of BU users who want to hardfork as soon as possible. Everyone else realises a contentious hardfork is bad for business and intends to hold one off until a large majority of users support it. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:16:36
Miners are only miners, in the end it is the users that count. That said, I believe it has been quite clear that most of the miners want bigger blocks. After all they usually want what the wider community want since that is what gives them the most profit. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 20:23:48
On a long enough timeline the survival rate for everyone drops to zero. 
Or, in other words, there's risk in everything, but there's also reward. Clearly you value the risk higher than the reward in this case. Others may judge it differently. If it's you or me who is being naive is yet unknown. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 06:21:45
48% is far from consensus. And node count is not necessarily a good gauge of user intent. Many nodes are parts of production environments that as a matter of principle use the latest version of the most stable software which, incidentally, is the Segwit software. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 05:58:39
Good point. Most protocols just upgrade but keep the backwards compatibility. An alternative that is not as useful to bitcoin since it needs immutability more than most. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 20:49:26
I don't see it as very much of an existential risk. There's a possibility of course, but it is very small. If there are severe problems with the new hardfork there's always the possibility of a new hardfork to fix the problem. Or even of going back to the legacy chain if it problems arise immediately after the fork. Of course it's best to avoid problems altogether, but if problems arise, there will be ways to solve them. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:15:49
The trauma of hardforks seems for some reason greatly exaggerated. It's just a non-backwards compatible upgrade. Happens all the time in software development. Of course it should be handled with care since there's much money at stake but it's not like the end of the world. And removing impediments to bitcoins future growth seems like a great reason to do a hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 06:19:32
Of course I will. Some minor modifications from Core is all it takes for me to switch back to them. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:42:04
There's never consensus for anything in a community with millions of participants. And in bitcoin's case it is also practically impossible to gauge support in anything but rough estimates. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 08:33:02
If Core really cared about decentralisation they should make node wallets useful again. Bitcoin was decentralised when users (wallet owners) ran nodes. Make that happen again and bitcoin will be decentralised no matter have big the blocks become (sort of). 
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:27:34
Of course you can. A well-executed hardfork (upgrade) should not bother the users in the least. Even a badly executed hardfork is unlikely to wreak more than temporary havoc. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:02:43
The community quite obviously does not want Segwit either. Otherwise it would have been activated by now. Core might ignore this fact, but that is the same as admitting they are just an ordinary client with developers that produce the code that they personally prefer. That is a notable step down from the previous notion that Core is the default bitcoin client that try to take the views of the whole community into consideration. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:54:29
People use bitcoins because other people use bitcoins. It's not very likely that a hardfork will result in two equal currencies that are both equal used. Much more likely is that users will flock to the currency that have the largest community. The other chain will of course live on, taken well care of by the extremists on the losing side. And they will of course blame the other side for hijacking bitcoin and using it for their nefarious purposes. Note that this will be true no matter which side wins or loses. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:40:08
That is very unlikely to happen, at least as long as nodes are as complicated to run as they are at present. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:20:55
There's always people who do not upgrade for one reason or another. My point is that these non-consensus people are not a problem unless they are numerous enough and dedicated enough to uphold a community by themselves, which is quite demanding. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:51:35
As you say, talk is cheap. What we're waiting for now is a move from Core's side. Will they compromise in order for us to get forward or will they forever stall until a split becomes unavoidable?
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:20:40
That's a very noble standpoint that, if applied uniformly, would no doubt have killed off the human species through eternal war millenia ago. If you want the same faith for bitcoin, by all means please keep up your otherwordly standards. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:38:54
Safe except the risk for slow irrelevance. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 05:52:08
Not likely. Bitcoin is mostly network effect. And even half of bitcoin will still be by some distance the largest cryptocoin out there and as such the major beneficiary of the network effect. The only way another cryptocoin can come to rule the world is if bitcoin, for some reason, becomes technically inferior by, for example, severely limiting transaction capacity. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 08:44:32
There's obviously a risk with everything. And bigger blocks might open up new attack vectors. But a congested blockchain is not very different from a continuous attack on the network. That well known risk has to be weighed against the possible new risks that a blocksize increase carries. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:03:36
Because not enough users want it in its present form of course. Your question should rather be what Core intends to do about it?
@_date: 2017-02-05 06:02:52
Personally I don't see a great problem with two coins. There will be a major coin, with most of the hash power and userbase called bitcoin, and a minor coin upheld by the extremist fringe from the losing side. There will be no doubts as to which coin is bitcoin, the loss of a fraction of the userbase will be insignificant compared to the general growth and we would have won an alternative coin that might be useful if some apocalyptic theories turn real. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:55:35
Plan B might be compromising instead of stonewalling. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:21:38
If you are dead set against all hardforks then I'm afraid you have no alternatives but to sit it out until the next critical bug kills you off. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 17:53:14
It's possible you can find someone who does not want layer 2 solutions at all. But they are so few that you could as well ignore them. 
This is a major problem with discussions within the bitcoin community right now. Each side is trying to debate the extremist fringe on the other side and too few are concentrating on the big majority in the middle. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:49:37
There's already a majority of miners signaling either for BU or Segwit, both blocksize increases. It's probably safe to assume that part of the rest also want bigger blocks but just hasn't come round to which side to support. 
There's almost no ordinary users running nodes as it is. Node operators are businesses, miners and enthusiasts, neither group is very likely to throw in the towel because of bigger blocks, all three groups will, however, grow as the wider ecosystem grows. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:44:01
Lightning is years away from widespread adoption. We need something to get us through those years in good shape. Besides, 400M Lightning users will demand quite a lot of blockspace as well, most probably significantly more than 2 Mb blocks can provide. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:31:19
Bitcoin gets its value from its usefulness. If there are no actual use cases, for example paying for stuff, then it's nothing but a Ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:22:41
Not surprising. The market hates the thought of a split. The talk of UASF combined with Antpool taking a stand makes a split very much more likely. Considering the increased risk of something apocalyptic actually happening the price has held up quite well. But of course it is a gigantic stain on the entire bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:21:43
As far as I have heard Segwit allows 70% more transactions per block given current user patterns. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:08:18


Prove it! Otherwise my common sense is just as good as yours (or better on the strength of my argumentation, but that is not for me to judge). 


Care to elaborate? As it stands your reply makes no sense. 


No one does. But we are discussing the merits of blocksize increases. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:22:40
Even if that was true that would not alter the argument as long as the BU supporters think they favour bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:53:38
You mean to say that when everything comes crashing down at least the blame will fall more on someone else than on you? 
Well, that's great. But personally I prefer to avoid the apocalypse rather than being able to blame the apocalypse on someone else. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:38:52
It still makes no sense from a rational perspective. Even if Jihan wants to keep blocks small he could just refrain from signalling for segwit without the BU signalling. The BU signal only splits the community and lowers the price. Both block rewards and transaction fees take a dive when the bitcoin price decreases. It makes a mockery of the fantasy that Jihan is only in it for the money. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:03:22


No one is threatening anything. BU is a sideshow exploiting the fact that a big majority of bitcoin users want bigger blocks. Get them bigger blocks and interest in BU will return to zero. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 08:26:39
Segwit is only a small blocksize increase. More will most certainly be needed. Some people doubt that Core will ever provide a hardfork blocksize increase. As long as that doubt persists it makes political sense to block the short-term gain that segwit represents in order to achieve a more long-term solution with both segwit and a hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:01:17
In other words you are utilising the centralised chokepoints of the system to force a change unto the system. If bitcoin had been truly decentralised this would surely not be possible. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:23:01


There's no practical way for you to do that. Anyway you turn will be susceptible to bias. If you really did know the sentiment of the community it is amazing that you allowed segwit to be put forward in its current format. 


From the context it is quite clear that that is not the intended interpretation. People might of course misinterpret anyway. Still, even if you count 2Mb+segwit as support for current segwit proposal there is still 37% for a hardfork blocksize increase (BU or static). 
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:19:08
I'm not referring to technical complexities as much as systematic ones. Segwit as a softfork is only opt-in which means some users will opt-out. This in turn means that for example transaction malleability will still be an issue between opt-out users. The opt-out is anyway highly debatable, at least for business users which will need to be segwit-ready in order to receive coins instantly from segwit users. What I'm saying is there is plenty of potential traps coming from the softfork. Something that seems very unnecessary if a hardfork is anyway to take place. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:02:55
I know nothing of that. But I find it highly unlikely that anyone would spend significant amounts to decrease wealth for everyone including themselves. Some people like to prove a point, but I would be surprised if they like it that much. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:17:38
Either that, or he simply does not share your opinion on the scalability issue. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 07:13:01
Segwit is a less than doubling of blocksize. Most opponents probably believe this to be too little too late. Especially if they don't expect to get anything more within the foreseeable future. 2 Mb blocks might have been sufficient two years ago, when it was first proposed seriously. But in the present situation it would be gone almost immediately. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 05:48:44
If you have something to prove, it does. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:34:34


Sounds like a good description of the softfork that introduced blocksize limits. Although, personally I don't see that as an attack since it had broad support at the time. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:59:35
If the business deal is he taking all transaction fees and others taking all block rewards it is of course a somewhat different matter. However, it is still not feasible long term if block rewards are severely reduced only to protect transaction fees (which also decreases with price decreases). Something that hits Jihan Wu's customers will, in due time, hit Jihan Wu as well. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:55:51
It's confusing, we can agree on that. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:08:51


Not the XT guys. They did not get everything they wanted. As for the Classic guys, whomever they might be, they were quite clear about Classic as a compromise solution, something temporary, very far from everything they ever wanted. 


Please elaborate on this. Who has removed your ability to ever get what you want (must be some big brutish fellow considering your phrasing). 
@_date: 2017-03-27 05:05:06
Bitcoin has not changed and obviously work as well as it always has. The problem is that bitcoin cannot grow, it is losing momentum and its network effect is being slowly eroded. Since bitcoin is very much about network effect this is a serious issue. When was the last time you saw an announcement of a new merchant accepting bitcoins? It doesn't happen very often nowadays. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 05:39:23
A chair is something that people call a chair. A table is something people call a table. Bitcoin is what people call bitcoin.

If that is true then there is literally no reason whatsoever for Core not implementing a blocksize increase. That way they will keep the Core hegemony and we can all live happily ever after. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:35:56
From the perspective that the entire community regards it as illgotten money you are of course correct. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:50:39
They cannot veto it, they can just force a split. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 07:51:31
Some people might have said that. But the majority of BU supporters almost certainly would go with Core if it hardforked to Segwit and a bigger blocksize. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:26:43
Obviously it is working. But it still has multiple weaknesses making a proof-of-stake system preferable. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:01:44
If UASF was likely to happen it would probably crash the markets way more than the current turbulence. Luckily for us it does not seem imminent. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:29:53
UASF dramatically increases the risks of a split, which is what the markets dread most of all. It might turn out alright in the end but during the transition we will all take a beating. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 08:36:01
While there might be extremists on both sides I'm pretty certain the vast majority are perfectly happy to compromise in the middle. After all, nearly everyone accept that we will have to switch to layer 2 solutions as soon as possible. But most also accept that we need enough blockspace to keep growing until those layer 2 solutions are ready and to anchor those many layer 2 transactions to the blockchain. There's really not much of a conflict if you only want bitcoin to keep being digital cash. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:51:31
Actually the roadmap says that a hardfork should be implemented when "their risks [are] widely acceptable relative to the risks of not deploying them". 
One could easily argue that the risks of not doing a hardfork, from community split etc, now greatly outweigh the risks of a hardfork. For some reason Core does not seem to see it this way. We can only hope that they now what they are doing. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:16:11
I can't speak for the miners, but in general it should be obvious that no one wants a split in the community. Great effort should be placed on finding consensus solutions to keep the community together. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:14:51
Help find common ground for a compromise between the Core and the BU camps. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:30:03
Node count honestly doesn't show anything. Most enterprise nodes (probably a good part of the most active nodes) will just upgrade to the latest version out of principle, which basically is what your statistics say. 
If you want another opinion you can look at the entities positions on the bitcoin wiki: 
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:33:45


If I got payed for it, definitely. Actually, I have also done this for free multiple times in different open-source projects. When working in a larger team you often do things that you personally think are suboptimal or otherwise not to your liking. 


It is a political failure that they seem incapable of getting their superior technology segwit activated. Obviously they should have communicated better and listened more to the wishes of the community. This could be due to political malfeasance but is probably political ineptitude. Either way it is far from optimal. 


That's just not true. Everywhere there's people, there will be politics. Politics is simply the art of human interaction. If you want proof you need only look at bitcoin's current predicament which, all sides agree, are not technical but political. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 07:44:35
Did you just say that bitcoins have no value if it cannot be exchanged for fiat? That's a remarkable statement. Personally I have never sold bitcoin for fiat and still it has value to me. Anyone saying something else has a very strange perception of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:32:00
Personally I believe layer two solutions will take rather long time to gain traction. I might be wrong of course, but that is my belief. What is troubling in the circumstances is that some people argue for a high fee pressure in order to force adoption for layer two solutions. That is of course a horrible idea, and even if patently false the impression of its existence is still feeding the anti-segwit side. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:29:22
If it is a large group of people I see nothing wrong with that. Bitcoin is not a technical project as much as an economic one. Economic weight is what counts. It's a pity the economic weight can only be approximated until a split has actually happened. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 05:52:37
Of course it's risky. But risk aversion is not always the most reasonable approach. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:47:37
It's not a compromise if the other side doesn't want it. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:13:28
There's a risk in doing nothing as well. One could even argue that risk aversion in itself is unreasonable, what counts is risk management, getting decently rewarded for your risks. My personal opinion is that BU does not represent nearly enough reward compared to the risk. But I accept that other can come to other conclusions in that area. And on the other side of the spectrum Core's over-cautious approach is admirably low-risk, but also very much low-reward, especially now with the stalemate making almost nothing happen. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:29:13
The losses from a split will most probably be recouped in due time. But a split will but a permanent dent in bitcoin's upward trajectory meaning everyone is poorer than they would otherwise have been. 
No one wants a split. But if people want to compromise even less than they want a split, then there will be a split. Simple as that. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 06:24:11
Volatility has come down significantly in the last 4 years. The sorry part is instead that adoption has grind to a complete halt. These days I actually see more posts informing about companies removing their bitcoin support than I see news of businesses adding bitcoin alternatives. Reasons for this may vary but most likely it is due to high transaction fees and slow transaction confirmations. There's still reasons to be enthusiastic of course, but bitcoins development into a true currency seems to be going rather slowly at the moment, which should be cause for some concern. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:32:26


How could it not be? Your paying attention to the community is completely dependent on which parts of the community you are paying attention to, in other words your bias. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:56:37
It says in Core's scalability roadmap that a hardfork blocksize increase shall take place when the risks of doing one is less than the risks of not doing so. Considering the current risks to the entire bitcoin project one could be excused for believing that this point of inflection has already been passed. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:44:50


When negotiationg it is preferable to do so from a position of strength. 


No one is saying that. We do, however, need enough blockspace to keep growing organically until second layer transactions come on stream in a couple of years time. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:23:52
Might be. But that is kind of the problem. You tell the other side what they want and when you give it to them you are surprised they don't extol you. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:18:34
Obviously not big enough. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:11:17
From a technical standpoint that is correct. But it is madness economically. A split will erode much of bitcoin's network effect and destroy value all around. For the nerds that might be acceptable but as an investor I am ready to stand down to secure my investment, at least temporally. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:56:45


You might actually believe that. But you cannot prove it. Personally I think it's bollocks. BU's dynamic blocksize proposal is untested and highly risky. I very much prefer a static blocksize increase and I'm not alone in that. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:50:46
If Core was prepared to do a hardfork blocksize increase they could deliver code saying the blocksize limit will be bumped up a year from now. This is so simple to do that this code could be delivered this afternoon. 
This does not mean that the hardfork will be done with this particular code. But a hardfork would be in the pipeline and it would be up to the Core developers to make sure it will take place safely in a year's time. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:20:41
The market is telling the community to fix these governance problems. Now it's up to the community to act. I guess the ball is mostly with the Core developers. I'm eager to see what they are making of this. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 06:47:04
It is both interesting and illuminating to see the comments to this particular incident. 
We have a long-time bitcoin user who quits and switches to an altcoin. This is spun as something beneficial by the commenters. Probably they feel some sort of vindication for being "right". But look at it from another angle and what we have is a bitcoin user who no longer wants to use bitcoin. Its usability has diminshed. It might have been necessary for a number of reasons to diminish the usability of bitcoin, but it can never be something positive, something to boast about. Most of all it is said and the fact that such a large number of people does not realise this should be cause for some concern. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:28:24
Yet, that is how it is being perceived. But it might as well be due to extremely poor communication on behalf of the Core team. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:21:35
There's no consensus for anything in the strict sense of the word. From the poll you can see that the support for segwit, at around 80%, is only slightly higher than the support for bigger blocksize. That's not the issue, however. You cannot achieve consensus in a group as large as the bitcoin community. What matters is what can be achieved without blockage. Segwit by itself clearly cannot achieve enough support, as witnessed by the pitiful support for only segwit in the aforementioned poll. Segwit with a blocksize increase might have a better chance. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:36:54
What would they have to lose except some pride? 2Mb blocks has been shown to be perfectly safe. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:52:04
No, read what I said. This could be delivered this afternoon. It would not be safe and secure code, but it would be live code. This would prove beyond doubt that Core means business when they say they will hardfork to a higher blocksize. The safety and security can then be prepared in the year between now and the date when the hardfork will take place. 
Something like this would benefit all. The segwit crowd could take pleasure in seeing segwit activate instantly. The bigblock camp would have a guaranteed promise of a hardfork blocksize increase in one year's time (if Core try to renege on their promise there would surely be chaos since the hardfork code is already out). In the meantime everyone could come together and plan the hardfork in the best possible way. The only ones possibly disappointed would be the BU devs who would be severely outflanked and luke-jr who would see his hopes for a 300kb blocksize limit dashed. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 06:11:24
As the developer of the default client it is definitely Core's responsibility to put forward suggestions on which the community can decide. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:17:53
I share his (probable?) opinion that a contentious split is something to avoid. However, I seem to accept a slightly higher risk for such a split. You can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs and all that. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:19:57
Segwit + 2Mb blocks would likely keep free blockspace for a couple of years. In a couple of years time we will hopefully have fully functional second layer transactions making this community splitting issue much less potent. And even if it's still potent at least we would have a tried and tested avenue for further blocksize increases making them much less dramatic. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:01:21
If you take Lightning as cash then bitcoin must be gold. It's actually eerily similar to the gold standard. It thus seems perfectly reasonable to be a digital gold fanatic and endorse Lightning. In fact, that is how I have understood the reasoning. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:34:10
I doubt that BU miners will fork anything before they have the support of a majority of users. Anything else would be stupid. On the other hand that majority of users might not be as far off as some on r/bitcoin believe or are lead to believe. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:42:42
That's about as true as saying a disproportionately powerful and divisive fringe is standing in the way of bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:23:45
A split might crush the bitcoin economy. But a hardfork need not lead to a split. 
Problem right now is that not all people want a hardfork. Hence the two sides trading insults. But no one actually wants a split, even though some, on both sides, seem ready to risk one in order to get what they want. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:24:21

@_date: 2017-03-28 10:45:35


It can be easily disproved by simply providing the hardfork code. Actually I find it quite astounding that this has not already been done. 


There's nothing stopping you from implementing segwit before a blocksize increase. I pretty certain that most people will accept that. What they won't accept is some vague promises of non-specified scaling solutions in the non-specified future. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:19:08
I'm of the same mind but the other way around. Since we needed a blocksize increase yesterday it is paramount that we get one quickly. The only decently tested blocksize increase available at the moment is segwit. Personally I would have preferred a regular blocksize increase and segwit as a hardfork, but it is too late for that. What we should be aiming for now is immediate segwit softfork activation and the promise of a hardfork segwit combined with a hardfork blocksize increase in about a year's time.

It's a political thing. You want something that I have (or in this case I can stall), I want something you have (or can deliver in this case). Then we can trade. But a trade doesn't work if one side gives all they have away for free and hope the counterparty will voluntarily give something back at a later date.

Sometimes you can do democracy for democracy's own sake. And you can be anti-incumbent to not support the incumbents. Look at Trump, he's a soft-skinned papa's boy with a yellow wig. Judging by his own merits no one would vote for him. But he still won the election by not being the incumbents. Socially speaking BU is like Trump and Core is like the vested political class. Some people just want a bit of revolution now and then.

It's not strange. It's political. Core has more or less indicated that Segwit is the one and only capacity increase. If you disagree with that then it's far better to demand more concessions now than to do it at a later time when your bargaining position is much weaker. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:24:38
The activation odds would still be close to zero. The price might shoot up a bit due to decreased risk for a contentious BU split. But I don't think a one-time price increase matters very much to them in the longer run.

The fanatical BU users are insignificant and will not split anywhere (note how they are huffing and puffing but don't intend to do anything until they have at least 75% of mining behind them). The fringe of Core users who for political reasons are against a hardfork (there are no technical reasons against a hardfork blocksize increase) are likewise insignificant as they are unable to keep a chain alive for any period of time. Neither miners or businesses will follow them and on their own they, as well, can only huff and puff.

It could be as simple as that pesky HK agreement. If you negotiate with someone (or think you negotiate with someone for that matter, it doesn't affect the argument) and that someone goes on to completely ignore your negotitations you have to reply in kind. It is simple game theory, a matter of trust. And also a question of prestige. The Core team does not seem ready to make amends, in fact they don't seem to recognise there is a problem. Which probably is the crux of the matter. They might be good coders but they suck at politics. And as long as they do, and won't admit that they do, we will keep stalling. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 06:53:02
Your argumentation does not make sense, as you seem to notice yourself. The truth, of course, is that Ver and Wu have the support of a large minority of the community. Or, rather, Ver and Wu are supporting the large minority since there was a strong demand for a blocksize hardfork before BU came along. Ver and Wu are not taking over bitcoin, they are surfing the wave of popular anger. If Core supplied a blocksize hardfork the support for BU would fizzle out immediately no matter how many server parks Ver and Wu can buy.

Presenting segwit with a blocksize increase would probably get us most of the way to consensus. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:51:41
All agree that splits are bad. But a split is in fact developing at this very moment. Doing nothing can also lead to splits. 
There might be digital gold fundamentalists. I don't know any, but there might be. They may even hold a lot of coins. I seriously doubt they own any significant part of the infrastructure though. The infrastructure of bitcoin is focused on handling bitcoin; exchanges, businesses and markets are all focused on moving bitcoins around. They are not likely to prefer the digital gold approach. 
More to the point there is not much the digital gold fundamentalists can do if Core moves behind a hardfork blocksize increase. They could of course keep their minority chain alive. But the value in their coins would be significantly dented making a mockery of their claim of bitcoins as a store of value. 
While there are risks with a hardfork away from digital gold there are also risks with doing nothing and provoking a unilateral hardfork from the bigblockers. You have to weigh these risks. My opinion is that the greater risk today is from a bigblock contentious hardfork than from recalcitrant digital gold fundamentalists. The risk balance is also moving inexorably in the direction of the bigblockers. Core will not be able to pander to the digital gold fundamentalists forever without doing serious harm. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:14:41
There's probably people who honestly believe that BU is fundamentally superior to Core. But this segment is likely quite small. Most BU supporters are just general bigblockers who at the moment support BU because it is the only viable alternative to the Core narrative. Change the Core narrative and the better part of the BU supporters will most likely switch sides.

If size what all that matters then there would be no startups whatsoever. Google would always make the better implementation. In reality that does not hold true. If you believe that the 100+ developers are on the wrong track then obviously it is preferable with a few developers on the right track. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:32:58
As your own link state most people want segwit AND a blocksize increase. Which makes it all the more bewildering that that alternative actually does not exist. If Core could only produce this alternative that people say they want we could once and for all see what the community (including the miners) actually want. We might even get consensus. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:39:17
That poll says differently.

You will have to ask the Core developers about that. I would also very much like to know.

I'm talking about Classic too. Segwit supporters like to call segwit the compromise solution. But they forget (maybe intentionally) that Bitcon classic was a compromise suggestion between status quo and the more aggressive XT. Calling something a compromise doesn't make it a compromise.

That argument (which is thrown around a lot) makes no sense. If second layer transactions takes off it will greatly increase the value of bitcoins and hence the value of block rewards. Miners stand to gain handsomely from such a development. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:56:08
From this poll it is very clear that users want both segwit and a hardfork blocksize increase. 
Of course it is all down to what kind of users this bitcoinblog.de has. Of that I know nothing. But if they are in any way representative for the broader community (admittedly hard to find out) then miners and developers might be advised to take note. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:44:57
Decentralisation is not a good argument in this case. All nodes today have some reason to be nodes, be them practical or ideological. Then the very simple equation more transactions -&gt; more users -&gt; more decentralisation should hold true. Everyone saying something else has a steep hill of argumentation to climb. 


This is probably the worst argument for persuasion, ever. Basically you are saying that you will torture (economically) everyone else until they do as you wish. Granted, it worked in the Middle Ages, but I sort of hoped that we had passed that stage in human history. If anything it is a good argument for BU, at least they are not consciously inflicting pain upon you.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but BU's stated aim is to do a unilateral hardfork when they have secured enough mining power. If they do there would be plenty to worry about.

That might be true. I use to say that segwit transaction increases will be sufficient for a year. If you are correct that might be two years. But it cannot last forever, some day there will have to be hardfork blocksize increases. Phrased differently you could say that it is imperative for bitcoin as a community to prove that we can do successful hardforks. It might be better to prove this capability sooner rather than later. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:34:05
Correct. There is 1/4 million USD in transaction fees. But there is also 2M USD of block rewards. Or was. Because the bitcoin price has dropped 25% the last couple of days it's now only 1.5M. Someone just lost 0.5M USD in income trying to defend 250k USD income. Who is not capable of doing simple mathematics here? You or Jihan Wu?

My German is a bit rusty but the phrasing was done in a way that signalled a hardfork blocksize increase. Anyway it is sort of moronic to state segwit + 2Mb blocks instead of segwit + 1Mb blocks if you want to say that segwit is a blocksize increase. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 06:54:41
There's a big support for a bigger blocksize in the community. How big is of course difficult to assess but the poll on the German bitcoin blog a couple of days ago at least gives an indication:

Segwit is ready to activate immediately. I haven't seen any calculations on have quickly its improvements will be felt but since it's a fairly small percentage of all coins that do most of the coin movements I believe improvements could be relatively swift. Most probably swift enough for us to prepare and implement a real blocksize increase. And with that we will have four times transaction capacity, enough to give smooth sailing until layer two solutions are implemented and then we can evaluate what further actions are needed. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:00:35


What's that supposed to mean? In the early days there was no technical blocksize limit (except for the system limitation of 32Mb). Then there came along a softfork initiating the 1Mb limit. A limit that is at present coercively repressing us bitcoin users. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:12:08
Since the PoW threat and last days price crash it has actually begun to feel like a game of chicken. Who would rather destroy bitcoin than let the other side win? I must concede that on this issue I am the chicken. Personally I prefer bigger blocks. But if the smallblock side is actually prepared to wreck the entire bitcoin project with a PoW change then I am more or less forced to back down. Having bitcoins or worse, being heavily invested like I am, is no good position to have in this conflict. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:05:24
All this smacks of alternative reality. Doing (or at least very much risking) a hardfork to avoid a hardfork. The only stated reason for not doing Segwit as a hardfork is the risk of a split that a hardfork entails. This proposal very much risks a split in itself. It's frankly unbelievable that a suggestion like this is taken seriously. The only explanation I can think of is pride, no matter what we won't let the other side get what they want. This, as any sane person will recognise, is a sure route to disaster.

@_date: 2017-03-17 06:44:58
This is not possible for political reasons. Something which should be glaringly obvious for anyone looking at the situation without prejudices. 
Besides, it is probably bad from a technical perspective as well. Segwit as a softfork is a hack designed to avoid a hardfork. If you anyway intend to do a hardfork shortly afterwards there's no point in doing a technically complicated softfork first. Segwit as a hardfork is better than Segwit as a softfork, in the case of a hardfork blocksize increase it makes sense to put Segwit in the hardfork as well. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:34:11
That's a very autistic definition of a complex reality. The current system, bitcoin, is whatever the community decides to call bitcoin and use as if it is bitcoin. The existence or non-existence of another fork of the original blockchain is of no consequence. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:40:21
It can be a blocksize increase. Point is, if you only want to limit blocksize there is no reason to support BU. It is much better just doing nothing and keeping the status quo. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:07:07
Hence the guessing all around. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:46:22
Actually, a split might not be such a catastrophe if the risks are handled. It all depends on what you lose and what you gain. In a hardfork blocksize increase you might find that a minority choose to stay on the original chain and is thus lost to bitcoin. But this doesn't matter very much if the gains from the blocksize increase outweigh this. Say that 20% of users hate the hardfork and sell all their new bitcoins. That's a pity but if the blocksize increase leads to bitcoin's value increasing by 50% it will still be a net gain. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:05:37
That's not true. While there is no doubting that BU is technically inferior to Core it could still be the better alternative, or more correctly the least bad alternative, given certain circumstances. For example if you put a great value on onchain scaling. Using some political assumptions it is therefore perfectly possible to be reasonably knowledgeable and support BU. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:40:58
This is the real voice of reason. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:30:24
Full blocks is not a problem directly. If the blocks were filled with no-fee spam that would be a technical problem but not much else. The problem now is that blocks are actually filled with real transactions driving fees to previously unseen levels. This effectively puts a halt to continued growth in the bitcoin ecosytem and explains why these days we see more news of businesses removing bitcoin support than we see businesses adding support. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:41:31


I don't agree with you there. I am a developer myself and it's not unheard of that people use your software to do unintended or downright stupid things with it. Of course I don't develop economically critical software but I'm not sure that matter very much in this context. Give people freedom, that should not be too ideologically demanding for a bitcoin developer. 


I don't doubt their technical abilities. However, their political and economical nous seem somewhat more shaky. At the moment I believe bitcoin need more political than technical leadership. The problems at hand are not really of a technical nature. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:00:58
It is still a fork and a hard one at that. The degree of failure probably comes down to subjective opinion. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 10:09:20
But if it is not the kind of blocksize increase people want, then it doesn't matter. The question was how to get enough support to activate segwit. I gave a reasonable answer. Countering it with semantics is not really productive in the current climate. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:31:20
You will have to ask the Core developers about that. Most of the comunity seem to share your opinion on this issue. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:46:52
And it makes good political sense to stall segwit until a hardfork blocksize increase is delivered if you want to avoid the drama of the last two years. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:33:55
If 3. is correct you are absolutely right. However, even Core's own scalability roadmap says that a hardfork should happen when needed. They just have to wake up to the fact that it is needed by now. I'm not ready to give up hope on Core just yet. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:52:41


It's just as wishful as saying bigger blocks will lead to centralisation. The fact is we cannot know until afterwards. In the meantime we will have to resort to guesstimates. 


There is a cost to mining. But the cost is largely fixed, it's more or less blocks that cost money to mine. If we double the number of transactions within a block we essentially halve the cost per transaction. You seem to disprove of this cost halving in order to promote a competing technology that you favour. One could be excused for believing you are not playing entirely fair. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:25:20
BU already have plenty of nodes. And it's not difficult to set up more if need be. Nodes will most probably not be a problem if BU wants to hardfork. Which chain the users go for is anyone's guess. Which is precisely why it's frightening. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:21:29
I'm not really knowledgeable enough to know if what you say is correct. But strictly speaking it does not matter for the argument at hand. The softfork that introduced the blocksize limit is having a coercive impact on us today. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:23:18
Most likely the vast majority of miners will choose one of the chains which means that the other chain will be unable to make transactions. It is rather difficult to scam someone if they are not able to move their bitcoins, hence I think it is safe to say that the possibility of scams will be quite limited.

That's just silly. As someone who follows both r/btc and r/bitcoin I can without doubt state that r/bitcoin is by far the most devoted sub, their leader being Core. r/btc is a more disparate bunch, united in their hatred of r/bitcoin but quite heterogenous apart from that. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:00:47
This argument is heard a lot but makes no sense whatsoever. Transaction fees are a very small part of miner income. Block reward is the main income and it increases with increased bitcoin price. The bitcoin price rises with increased bitcoin adoption. Everything that increases adoption is thus in the economic interest of miners. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:52:57
It's trivial to make code that says activate segwit immediately and hardfork to a bigger blocksize in a year's time. That way you placate the very large minority who do not trust Core to deliver hardfork code and you still get ample time to prepare the actual hardfork and analyse the effects of segwit's optimisations. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:55:19
We all know that the technical ability is present, which is what makes it astounding. It would not be difficult to merge a hardfork blocksize INCREASE if there was a will for it.

Not necessarily. There's politics involved. If you don't believe that Core will ever deliver any more blocksize increase, something they have indirectly suggested, then this is the time to demand something higher.

Since the position of F2Pool would do nothing to break the current gridlock it makes a lot of sense to just go for the best alternative instead of the best available alternative. Since we are at a stalemate all alternatives are in a sense unavailable.

I have no personal experience of mining but I imagine capital expenditure is a greater cost than electricity for most miners. And mining equipment is perfectly possible to purchase with bitcoins. The miners will still need some fiat of course. But if I understood the scenario correctly these types of invalid blocks would only be a limited part of the rough miners mining operation. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:53:18
A well-used second layer transaction system locks up significant amounts of bitcoins. According to the laws of economics such a development will have to increase the price of said good. Of course you can speculate in the laws of economics being all wrong, but you can probably spend your time in better ways.

The community can vote but only developers can decide what is going to be on the ballot. As far as I know their is currently no alternative for segwit + blocksize increase. It is the duty of the developers, particularly Core developers, to provide that alternative in order for the community to be able to make a valid decision.

Bitcoin's value is not based on technical superiority. It is based on the network effect. Bitcoin is useful (and therefore has value) because others are using it. Split the coin in two and the parts will not equal the sum. 
Ethereum had nothing like Bitcoin's network effect. Still Ethereum took a beating in the markets. The fate for bitcoin will be much worse. (Although not technically the end of the world, that was retorical hyperbole which I assumed was obvious.)

It's actually not Core doing a gamble. You could say that Core is providing the deck and then it is up to the community if they want to use it for gambling. 


That's a funny way of putting it. Do you mean to say that we do not have two opposing camps now? 
They point with an exercise like this is to reconcile the two camps. You can have different opinions within a community as long as all opinions feel they are better off together than by their own. You could call that politics but a better description would be human nature. And since we aim (or hope at least) to have a lot more humans in the bitcoin community it's high time we start to cooperate human to human. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:35:40
It's a hack in the sense that it is adding extra complexity with the aim of avoiding a hardfork. If you are anyway doing a hardfork shortly afterwards it makes no sense to do Segwit as a softfork since it could be made better in a hardfork.

As a European this just sounds a bit too incredible to be true. On this side of the Atlantic only mobile broadband connections have data caps (most of them, not all of them, mind you). For a fixed connection to have a data cap is frankly unbelievable. If this means that the USA is not equipped to accomodate bitcoin nodes that is unfortunate but it would be even more unfortunate to dimension the bitcoin network to suit America and Africa rather than the developed world.

I don't see how a 2Mb blocksize increase two years ago would have eternally removed the possibility of a malleability fix or even segwit. In fact, segwit would probably havea activated long ago if we had increased the blocksize back then.

Semantics (like who broke what) is insignificant in situations like these. If one part feels cheated, then it is so.

@_date: 2017-03-28 12:29:15
They could easily do both. In principle it is very simple. Deliver code with segwit but also a hardfork blocksize increase one year forward. That way there will be two versions of segwit-activating code out in the wild and most probably segwit will then activate. It is then up to the community if they will continue with the hardforking code or chicken out and go back to the segwit-activating non-hardforking code. This is of course a gamble, it could lead to a contentious split a year down the line. But it is also a way of breaking the stalemate and giving everyone what they want without them having to resort to lousy software like BU. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:14:03
Even is this is true it does not explain the support for BU, which is also a way to increase the blocksize. Someone who only wants to limit blocksize increases should neither support segwit nor BU. Since this does not apply to Jihan Wu your theory is clearly false.

Hardforks are a necessary part of protocol maintenance. Bitcoin cannot hope to be longlasting if it cannot master the art of successful hardforking. It's not so much a technical question (a blocksize increase is anyway technically trivial) as a political one. We need to project an image of a community that can accomplish difficult things like hardforks.

Why would you? Most users signalling for BU just want bigger blocks. If Core could just put forward a hardfork blocksize increase that would literally pull the rug from under the feet of BU. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:54:52
I'm no particular fan of BU and will not deny the work Core has put down. But the future Core scaling ideas you mention are all very speculative. It is perfectly reasonable from a certain viewpoint to view them with scepticism and go for the certainty of BU's vision. Depending on Core's moves in the near future it might not be the correct choice but it is still reasonable given the information at hand. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:29:33
Correct me if I'm wrong, but all major Core developers are salarymen. They do what they are told. Now they can either be told to work in the general interest of the bitcoin community or they can be told to work for some particular interest group. The latter alternative is clearly not very good so I sincerely hope that the former is the correct one. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:32:47
A hardfork is not the same as a split. On the contrary, a well-designed hardfork is very unlikely to lead to a split. As for the necessity of a hardfork that is a matter of personal opinion. Personally I am for it but I respect that other may have other opinions. But that is of minor importance. Only fools will risk a split in order to make a point and thus the almost all users will fall in behind the majority and keep the community together, just as bigblockers have done for several years now and smallblockers might be forced to do in the near future. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 05:46:42
Anti-Core has been stalling segwit for some months now, but Core has been stalling XT/Classic for some years. Both sides are to blame and stating that we do not need any solution because the situation is not precarious enough for one side to cave in is sort of missing the point. It's a gigantic failure that the situation is as precarious as it is. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:48:38
Getting more transactions per second of course. Segwit is too little, too late and there is the impression that Segwit is the only blocksize increase that will ever come out of Core. The BU group believes the transaction capacity needs to be increased both in the short term (which Segwit can teoretically achieve) and in the long term, hence their solution with a flexible blocksize cap. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:36:42
This is probably the only feasible alternative forward. All other options will lead to some sort of split. Everyone who prefers one bitcoin instead of several should get behind this solution.

@_date: 2017-03-04 07:07:43
That's not a list of SegWit supporters. It's a list of enterprises which are SegWit ready, something entirely different. As I said, miner signalling is probably not too far of the general user opinions. 30% actively positive to SegWit, 20% actively negative and 50% neutral. The neutral bitcoin entities are obviously also preparing for a potential SegWit future and are thus represented on Core's list. But that does in no way mean they endorse the Core scalability roadmap. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:06:33
While I have nothing against Segwit it is probably too small for anything except mitigation. Lightning is promising but is probably years from widespread adoption. It would have been nice if the ecosystem could continue growing in the meantime.

It's not really contentious. The vast majority is at ease with bigger blocks. The resistance is almost entirely due to the hardfork part. And if a hardfork is anyway taking place, there's no use contending it.

I've heard those arguments. And there might be something to them. But since I am running a node myself on an eight years old laptop with no problems whatsoever, my personal opinion is that those arguments are highly overblown. We have to hardfork sometime (or more probably multiple times), I don't see the point in waiting until the last possible moment. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:21:30
A hardfork is by definition a split. The blockchain forks into two different heads. A split. But this is only a problem if both chains attract a significant part of the community making two smaller cryptocoins where there was earlier one bigger. But this is very unlikely to be a problem in the real world. Most of bitcoins value comes from its network effect, you use bitcoin because others use bitcoin. In a planned hardfork it will be obvious from the onset which chain has the most support and everyone who wants to actually use bitcoins for anything will migrate to that chain. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 14:50:44
I grant you that small blockers probably have further to go than big blockers on this issue, if nothing else because they thought of themselves as the big majority who need not compromise with fringe parties. But as this worldview shatters in the face of stalling Segwit adoption and growing BU influence, I believe most of the small blockers as well could accept the wisdom of compromise. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:42:45
Lightning will hopefully be good for small transactions. But it will not take much pressure of the blockchain since most small transactions have already been priced out or are about to be so. The 70% transaction increase provided by Segwit will thus be insufficient rather quickly, probably within a year. Which means we will probably have this discussion again sooner rather than later. For the good of bitcoin it would be preferable if we solve this issue for at least a few years giving enough time to take bitcoin to the next stage of digital cash. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:25:41
Your maths don't add up. Since the miners will be split between your alternatives 1. and 2. and assuming "bitcoin hardfork" and "bitcoin classic" will still have the same total market cap (unlikely in practice, but let's assume it for clarity) there will still be the same amount of hashrate chasing the same amount of block rewards. For miners there would be no difference. 
Also, the comparision with the Ethereum hardfork i somewhat misleading. For a start bitcoin lives of its network effect in a way that is unknown to Ethereum. Merchants are unlikely to accept two sorts of bitcoins so the fork with mainstream adaption is likely to prevail, there's not much use in digital cash which cannot be used. Secondly, there were real political and philosophical differences between Ethereum and Ethereum classic. No such deep split exist within bitcoin. If bitcoin splits and the big block fork seems to prevail, there is no reason except obstinacy for the small blockers to keep their fork alive. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 19:05:53
This is just dodging the question. What if the miners want a hardfork blocksize increase? Would Core provide one?
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:25:04
The end game is of course to force a compromise. In principle it is very simple. Some parts of the community primarily want Segwit and some want a blocksize increase. The logical thing is to do both at the same time. I'm sure this will happen in due time. Right now it seems we are mostly waiting for the Core developers to swallow their pride. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:28:48

@_date: 2017-01-28 20:29:38
Most certainly. But only a 70% blocksize increase. If you're anyway hardforking I suggest you place a rather bigger bet when you're already gambling. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:29:55
That would be bitcoin, of course, what do you suggest it would be? Which of course doesn't mean I have to use it, there are plenty of other coins available. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:41:29
You are the one misunderstanding. The longest chain is the chain with the most proof-of-work invested in it (based on the bitcoin genesis block). And it certainly is not the chain of dogecoin. 
There's no need for consensus in the sense that everyone have to agree. It is sufficient that enough nodes accept the rules for blocks to propagate. Considering that most economic heavyweights, and their nodes, have signed up for the New York agreement, there should be no problems getting the blocks to propagate. 
Since no one around here seems to have read the Satoshi white paper it might be appropriate of me to add a link: 
It's only nine pages. And if you read it many things will be a lot clearer. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 07:38:24
Only the miners themselves know the answer to that. But if we are to guess I believe they are waiting for a better deal. Most probably a deal that involves SegWit as a hardfork and/or a hardfork blocksize increase. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 15:58:25
I have nothing against Segwit. It seems to do what it's intended for. However, I do believe that as a blocksize increase it is rather small, 1.7 Mb instead of 1 Mb is not much of an increase given the usage growth we are expecting. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 09:31:08
There is no certainty that bigger blocks will lead to fewer nodes. It's a hypothesis. In practice bigger blocks may well yield more nodes. In the end it is not a technical question but a social and political one, and answers to them are never certainties. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:40:12
Maybe kicking the can down the road is precisely what we need to do. In a few years time layer 2 solutions will be implemented and widely used. Then this blocksize debate will have lost most of its potency. We just need to get there while continuing to be the world's primary cryptocoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:43:55
As far as I have understood the risks with a hardfork are mainly political. Technically it is not very complicated. And the political risk is of a contentious split, which seems a rather dull argument considering the contentiousness comes from one side warning about the issue being contentious, what one would call circular reasoning. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:29:31
If I want to receive my salary as a LN payment I need to have a LN channel able to accomodate my entire salary. Each LN channel locks up funds from the main chain which means that the main chain must have a value of more than everyone's combined salaries. Which is moon territory. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:36:55
It is a straight rebuttal to the claim that there is insignificant support for sw2x here. 
As for the rational discussion it is simple game theory. You can not renege on an agreement if you want to ever again be taken seriously in negotiations. An increased blocksize might not be strictly necessary in the near term, but it is no particular danger either, so there is no reason to block it other than for the sake of blocking. Which, frankly, is not a very good reason at all.

If you're going to hardfork to Segwit I expect you throw in a blocksize increase as well. Since the main risk with a blocksize increase is said to be the hardfork part there's no reason not to include if the hardfork is taking place anyway. 
@_date: 2017-01-29 05:55:04
With that chain of logic I assume you are all for a hardfork? After all there's not point in cramming together incompatible ideas on the same chain. 
As for myself, I see major reasons for keeping bitcoin as including as possible, the network effect not least. But to do this you need to combine the ideas from the main different groups within bitcoin. What is usually called compromise but which could just as well be called mutual appeasement.

@_date: 2017-01-26 12:56:09
I support Segwit from a technical perspective (not necessarily a softfork though). But from a political perspective I support stalling. The argument that Segwit is a ready solution is a moot one since Segwit is ready because the main development team has not prepared for a hardfork despite knowing of the significant community support behind such a solution. You could say that we, the Segwit-non-upgraders, are stalling bitcoin. But it is equally true that the developers have been stalling bitcoin for several years now by not preparing a hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:55:21
I don't really see how anyone could attack a chain with 90% of the hashpower. The 10% hashpower that remain on the legacy chain will most likely not be able to attack anything. 
If you mean that some of the 90% hashpower will fall away after the fork in a non-responsible way, that is of course possible. But there's no reason for them to do that right after the fork instead of in good time before the fork. 
The only feasible way any attack or breakdown could happen is really through some errors in the code of the sw2x upgrade. I don't know how likely that is but let's hope it won't happen. And if it does happen it will hopefully happen fast enough for the community to fall back to the legacy chain without too much disruption. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 20:42:41
I guess we'll see. Some, myself somewhat reluctantly included, would argue that bitcoin is already throttled by a lack of blockspace. A 70% increase is of course welcome, but it will not last very long. If those layer 2 solutions are very fast in coming, it might be good enough, but I doubt it. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:17:56
Luckily it is not up to you to decide which chain is invalid and not. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:10:55
It is not an existential question, as in a hardfork, but there are still problems. Both miners and merchants, two major set of players in the bitcoin world, will more or less be forced to upgrade to Segwit in order to keep functioning normally. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:11:07
Have you forgotten the 2/4/8? By this time we should almost be at 4Mb and preparing for 8Mb. You could say we are a bit behind the schedule. Someone has been stalling things. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 18:27:49
4 or maybe 8 Mb blocks plus the 70% increase from Segwit would be ample room for growth for the next 2-3 years. And if layer 2 solutions are not dominating the payment scene in 2-3 years time we probably have worse problems than a lack of blockspace. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:34:06
Why would it be an altcoin if it is propagated by nodes? If it is propagated it is clearly valid in the eyes of the network. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:32:39
That's not how bitcoin is defined in the white paper. What is valid or not is up to nodes to decide. And since there will be plenty of nodes accepting the longest chain the validity is in practice decided by the miners. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:17:04
Your argumentation is correct, but as usual in politics it builds on assumptions that are subjective in nature. 
While I don't deny that bitcoin has a value without user growth I believe that bitcoin's greatest asset is the network effect. And in order to keep that network effect bitcoin has to continue growing at a brisk pace. 
As for the blocksize it might also be worth noticing that a static blocksize actually mean a regressive blockchain growth, one that grows less and less for each year. As the size of the total blockchain increases each 1 Mb block adds less and less to the blockchain in relative terms. If one wants a blockchain with linear or even exponential growth (as hardware tends to develop) you would need a continuously increasing blocksize. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:57:35
Of course I don't expect everyone in the entire world to open a LN channel for their salaries. But even if just a fraction do it still means great demand for bitcoins which will mean profit for people who already own them. Now we only need the technology to actually deliver. As far as I have heard, the Litecoin experiment has not been encouraging. There's no sign of a LN ecosystem there yet. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:50:20
That's a problem for individual users, not for bitcoin as a whole. And arguably the same situation is present with a softfork Segwit, where users who do not upgrade will be facing certain problems. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 10:40:10
Most people on other parts of the internet do not have a bad feeling about Segwit. They do, however, have a bad feeling about being cheated of the blocksize increase. 
Yes, Segwit increases transaction volume by 70%, I assume everyone except an unimportant fringe knows this. But 70% is not enough. We need more blockspace than that. Maybe not today but definitely in the near future. Stalling Segwit might not make technical sense, but it makes a lot of sense politically. How else can we force a blocksize increase?
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:26:43
If enough people experience problem it might of course reflect badly on the wider bitcoin system. But given enough forewarning the problem will probably be limited. And, as mentioned, this is also a problem with softforks like Segwit.

Merchant software will work, yes, but not very good, if I've understood it correctly they won't see Segwit transactions until they have been included in a block, which is quite a limitation if you are in the business of getting payments from other people.

As you probably know that particular opinion is in no way unique to miners. In fact it is quite widespread in the bitcoin community, although not as widespread among developers. Who should pay for what can thus be argued. And, from the other perspective, one can argue that just because someone is able to produce lots of quality code, he should not have the right to dictate bitcoin development. Truth is there are lots of competing interests within bitcoin. Interests that need to compromise in order to keep up the forward momentum. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 05:44:42
My source is the Bitcoin Core Segwit guide which says: 
"If you don’t upgrade, you may experience one difference: if someone who has upgraded to segwit pays you, your wallet may not show you the payment until after it has been included in a block. This is a safety feature that prevents your wallet from seeing transactions it doesn’t completely understand until they’ve been confirmed by a miner."

@_date: 2016-12-15 14:46:28
You might very well be right about the blocks, but why not reinsert some sort of soft cap in that situation? 
As for politics it is just delusional to believe that technology can by some magic negate politics. Politics is everything that concers the interactions of people. People use bitcoin, hence politics will be a part of bitcoin. And you have to be blind not to see that it is politics that is holding up SegWit implementation just as it is politics holding back a hardfork blocksize increase. Neither of those decisions are based on technical arguments, instead they are political. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:52:35
The longest chain will be bitcoin. Of course we can not know with certainty which chain will be longest come November. But considering that 92% of current hashpower is signalling NYA it would be very unlikely that any other chain emerged longer three months forward. And since it looks like the 2x chain will be bitcoin in November it would be both stupid and possibly fraudulent by Bitpay to not inform its clients of the need to upgrade. Wouldn't you agree?
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:47:53
Sorry for not reading all the FUD swirling around at the moment, but if I understand it correctly Bitpay has told their customers to upgrade to Segwit2X, the chain which will most likely be the longest chain, and hence bitcoin, come November? What is there to rally against there? I understand you prefer the solution without the 2x part, but even so segwit2x is the most likely outcome given its widespread support and not upgrading to that chain would place Bitpay customers on the wrong, and probably unusable, chain. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:13:40

The definition of a fork is one entity splitting into two (or more). Bitcoin A in your example will thus be both bitcoin A and bitcoin B come November. Which version will be called bitcoin on exchanges and in people's minds is anyone's guess although I figure segwit2x has the best chances (if nothing else for the simple reason that most exchanges support it). 
@_date: 2016-12-16 06:19:56
No one's denying that technical aspects affect the politics, in bitcoin more than usual. But there's also no denying politics central role. For example, at the heart of the blocksize debate is the issue of node count, basically how many real people want to set up a node. A fundamentally political issue where technology only plays an indirect role. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 09:12:34
The funny thing, if you could use such a word in the present situation, is that a compromise has been plain for all to see for a long time, just do a hardfork with both Segwit and a blocksize increase and most people will get most of what they prefer. The situation right now seem to be mostly a problem with pride. Segwit camp cannot be seen giving ground to the big block trolls and big block camp have come to believe their own lies of Segwit being all bad and a vehicle for Blockstream domination.

Most congratulations should probably go to that guy Barry Silbert who made the compromises necessary for SegWit to activate. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 12:18:12
I see, thank you for the explanation. 
However, this does not necessitate SegWit before a hardfork. An increase in the allowed blocksize does not immediately increase the blocksize to that level. Rather, there will be a more gradual increase as the larger blocks fill up, giving time for further improvements along the way. 
The reason the big block crowd wants a hardfork before SegWit is most probably not due to technical reasons as much as political. There is a lack of trust in the current community and the big block minority fear that they will not get a blocksize increase at all unless they hold sufficient ransom, for example by holding up SegWit implementation. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:39:07
What's a consensus rule? I can't find anything about it in the white paper. The white paper does say, however, that consensus is established with hashpower. And since an overwhelming majority of hashpower is signalling NYA I guess we can conclude that we have consensus for segwit2x, which makes any other implementation an altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 15:10:02
If you are desperate it would not be too much to ask to just assemble a hardfork block increase and bundle it with Segwit. It's technically not very difficult and could probably be delivered in a few months time (the actual hardfork could then wait a year or so to let everyone upgrade which is perfectly acceptable as long as the hardfork code has been delivered). 
Refusing to compromise as a matter of principle is called stalling in my book. What's more, it's also stupid. Politics is a game of give and take. You cannot all take. That doesn't work. Which is precisely what is happening now. It doesn't work. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 08:18:41
Zero market reaction this far. 
Which is very interesting. Markets seem to dislike good BU news. But this incident shows that markets don't care about good Segwit news. 
The logical interpretation is that markets are agnostic about segwit but do fear a community split. Increased support for BU increases the risks of a split, hence markets down. But increased support for segwit does not affect a community split, hence no reaction from markets. 
While this might seem petty it actually is of some interest since markets are the best approximation of the will of the "economic majority", this entity whose opinions on everything are very much in demand these days.

@_date: 2017-04-12 20:43:17
I'm no fan of BU but it is pretty obvious that their claim of decentralisation comes from providing an alternative to (the highly centralised) Core, not their implementation per se.

This is great news. It might be possible to improve on the details. But that a compromise with both segwit and a hardfork is the way forward has been clear for some time now. At least for those of us who want bitcoin to remain one currency. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 05:59:58
Why would they fake signalling? What would they gain from that? Of course there can always be malicious actors but bitcoin is in a way built around the fact that greed is good. There are no real defences against actors who are willing to spend real resources in order to undermine the network. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 12:46:50
That's one way of seeing it. Another is to see bitcoin as a more credible currency when it has proved its ability to upgrade through hardforking. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:06:43
What's the use of tricking half the network to accept segwit when that half is anyway going to fork away soon after? It's like forcing a fork. But if you want to fork you can just go for a simpler alternative like the UASF. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 05:57:08
Why would you reject a hardfork if it has broad support and is anyway going to happen? The only result will be to leave you on a dying minority chain with coin values a fraction of what you would otherwise have.

A compromise, by its very definition, need two parties. You cannot compromise all by yourself. If the other party does not accept the compromise then it is obviously not a compromise.

Interesting. Have they shown any opinions on the matter?
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:47:05
Personally I'm more interested in knowing what types of nodes are currently running and what stats they have. How many commercial nodes are there compared to "ideological" ones? Having those numbers would enable all sorts of back-of-the-envelope calculations. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 05:47:46
There's obviously no way of knowing that 8Mb blocks are "safe". Some things you can only gauge in practice on the actual network during actual usage under actual political circumstances. 
That said, it is certainly unsafe to do nothing. Stagnation is death for a project like bitcoin and that risk has to be weighed against the risks of any new features.

You don't compromise with the miners, you compromise within the bitcoin users. If you are only reading this sub you might be under the impression that all users support segwit and the only obstacle is a bunch of miners. Well, I'm sorry to say that you have been misinformed. There are plenty of users, with no covert mining income to defend, who also prefer bigger blocks to segwit. If you deny this fact then this whole situation will seem incomprehensible to you. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:51:40
Of course we don't need consensus, something which is anyway impossible in a community of millions. All we need is a significantly large majority to make one of the chains dominant. That there will continue to be one bitcoin in the network effect sense of the word. Leaving 10-20% behind on a minority chain is insignificant since the scaling possibilities unleashed by a change like this will more or less instantly enlarge the economy with more than 20% making even the new split coin more valuable than the previous un-split coin. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 18:13:27
Softforks are very limited in scope. Being able to do successful hardforks would be very much to bitcoin's credit. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 18:14:41
Because it signals an ability to change with changing circumstances. The world of cryptocoins is changing rapidly and bitcoin will have to change with it unless it wants to be left behind by more innovative coins.

That's just weird. Who sets the direction? 
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:27:28
You must be blind if you believe we have consensus at the moment. What we do have is stalemate. The pros of being on the bitcoin network outweighs the cons of its many failings. And this will be true in a split as well. Of course you can spend a lot of money keeping alive a minority chain. But for what use? If it's bitcoin you want (the name, the "digital cash" concept) then it's on the majority chain you need to be, no matter what rules that majority chain currently has. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 12:56:55
Or it could indicate that the users are not very interested in security and only want a simple-to-use digital cash system.

Gold has usability, mostly as an ingredient in jewellery. No one will ever make bracelets out of bitcoin, hence bitcoin need some other usability. Being able to do everyday transactions certainly fits the bill. It might be something else as well but transactions are tried and tested so I suggest we stick to that. Just being scarce and unchanging does not imply value. Lots of things are both scarce, unchanging and totally worthless. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 19:16:42
I don't deny that gold gets most of its value from its status as store of wealth. But the fact that it is and was seen as a store of wealth is due to the fact that it has actual usability, people want it. 
It's funny that you mention recorded history and then ask for examples of worthless stores of value. Because there is something from before recorded history that fits that bill. You might have heard of obsidian, a hard greenish stone very useful for making tools and weapons during the stone age. Obsidian thus had usability. But it was also a store of wealth, pieces of obsidian was used in barter much like gold and silver would be later on. The point here is that there are no vaults filled with obsidian today, despite it being scarce, unchanging and with a history as a store of wealth. Obisidian went out of fashion with the metal age. When people could make superior tools and weapons out of bronze and iron the usability of obsidian disappeared. And with no usability its value as a store of wealth also disappeared.

What's the definition of economic majority in cases like this? I'm asking because a significant part of the bitcoin ecosystem, namely the DNMs, will never tweet about their intentions. They might not be a majority by themselves (without knowing any numbers I assume they are at least major players) but they do demonstrate the dangers with relying on public signaling. It all seems very un-bitcoin to me. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:12:55
I don't know if it's intentional on your part, but this is exactly what the anti-segwit keeps saying. That once segwit activates there will never be a hardfork and hence no more on-chain scaling. 
@_date: 2016-09-25 17:57:49
I don't. I only know that bitcoin could use a block increase about now to lower confirmation times and transaction fees. What LN needs is secondary since it is still some years from implementation. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 08:25:18
Consensus might not be possible, but majority certainly is. 
@_date: 2016-09-25 18:31:56
What about compromising, the way human beings usually settle their differences?
@_date: 2017-04-01 05:55:05
The only reason to do that would be to force segwit as a hardfork instead of a softfork. And while I personally see some merit in that alternative it would take a lot of time to prepare, time that we simply do not have (remember that all parties agree scaling should have happened yesterday). Segwit as a softfork and a hardfork at a later date is thus the reasonable way forward. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 13:00:10
How do you know what "they" originally asked for? 
If you refer to Bitcoin Classic and their 2Mb blocks then you need also add that Classic was in itself an attempt at compromise from the even bolder blocksize increases. It was also two years ago and marketed as a first step to be followed by more increases at a later that (meaning about today). 
@_date: 2017-04-16 06:29:40
Are we just trying to denigrate someone whose opinions we disapprove of again? 
Since Gavin's statement is factually correct. The bitcoin network needs full nodes to monitor miner honesty. But the common user hardly needs it only to verify personal transactions. Nothing out of the ordinary there.

Personally I have no problems with lightning. And I can see risks with bigger blocks. I do, however, see a problem if some people play tactically to get their preferred outcome against the best interests of bitcoin. You seem to hold the view that blocks need to get bigger. But you do not want them to get bigger yet because you want another technology that you personally prefer to get a head start. Regardless how you look at it that is a nasty piece of argument and it makes me, at least, view r/btc somewhat more favourably. 
@_date: 2016-09-25 13:48:02
If you have to increase the block size, which you have to since a fully functional LN will require more transactions than currently, why not increase it immediately? 
@_date: 2016-09-25 11:31:53
Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you right now confirming the view of the r/btc shills that Blockstream/Core is inhibiting bitcoin development in order to facilitate their own payment application? I always thought that accusation was a bit daft, maybe I'll have to review my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:31:17
Everybody knows that already. The real question is when it will be implemented? For some time now we've been hearing that LN was ready to roll out as soon as Segwit activated. Well, Segwit has activated and I hear very little about the LN roll-out. I would have expected it to be all over the place by now. Since I think LN is a really good idea it's fair to say that I'm a bit disappointed. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:36:06
NYA was presented with the intention to activate Segwit. Its intention was never to avoid a hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 09:47:39


I have not time to read reasearch papers now. But you referring to research means that there are no smoking guns here, no real proof, just statistical analysis and guesswork. It takes faith to believe things like that. Faith that you obviously have. But in matters of faith there will always be sceptics. Which can be difficult for the faithful to comprehend. 


A monopoly is always lucrative. But I see nothing in segwit2x that will lead to monopoly power. Since mining is already a highly specialised, very capital-intensive enterprise, a slightly raised bar of entry is really no problem at all. 
For those of us in the real world it is clear beyond doubt that the one thing mattering to miners is ever increasing bitcoin prices. A rising bitcoin price increases the dividend on the investment and since it raises the dividend on the margin the profit increase is dramatic. Anything that risk price depreciation is thus catastrophic for miners. They simply won't risk it. And, conversely, everything that could lead to sustained price increases is worth considering, no matter the other circumstances. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 19:29:14
What they're saying is that the bitcoin network will work perfectly fine with just 10% of the current nodes. It is still a sufficient number of nodes to relay transactions. The 90% Core nodes will just be ignored like any other altcoin. 
This obsession with node count is really a bit perplexing. There is a valid point that less nodes will make the network less decentralised. But this is an ideological argument rather than a technical one. From a technical perspective the network could work with just one node if it was powerful enough (there's probably some details in the protocol making this impossible, but look for the principle rather than the minutiae and you get the point). 
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:03:56
What is the definition of brigading and how do one know that it is occuring? 
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:54:15
This is a good example of why you are losing the hearts and minds in this battle. Bitcoin is not a technical project as much as a social one. And a social project does not consist of binary choices. If you persist in that worldview you will keep losing a few adherents every time you make a movement. In the long run those few adherents add up and some time you will find yourself in the minority and wonder what happened. Of course you can blame it all on the devil himself (or Ver or Wu or whatever name you put on him). But no one is that powerful or that cunning, unless you make them so. 


It doesn't really matter if someone is spamming the network. I find it very unlikely that someone is doing it. But it doesn't matter. What does matter is that fees are permanently high and confirmation times are permanently unreliable making bitcoin unsuitable as a currency. I remember this sub a few years ago when the front page used to be plastered with news of the latest merchants implementing bitcoin support. You don't see that anymore. If anything you see news of merchants disabling bitcoin support. From that it should be clear that something is seriously wrong with the current bitcoin implementation. Something needs to change. A blocksize increase might not be the best and certainly not the most sustainable change but it will get bitcoin moving again. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:43:54

@_date: 2017-10-04 04:59:09
While it's possible that miners are spamming the network to increase fee pressure it makes no sense for them to press for a blocksize increase that would severely lower their fees. In your worldview, how do you explain the segwit2x compromise? What was the miner's rationale for that?
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:33:15
It's not misinterpretation on my part, rather then misinformation from the developers. LN is most definitely not in early stages of development, unless of course we've all been lied to. It is said to have been working on testnet (I haven't verified this myself, so can't really know). That means there is working code. This means the project should be in late stages of development and early stages of implementation. At this stage there should be only minor alterations to the code and focus should instead be on building the necessary infrastructure, what is commonly known as a roll-out. I am not seeing anything of this, which could mean I put too much trust in the driving forces behind LN but could also mean we've all been lied to/misled. Anyway, I still have hope, but right now it's slowly eroding.

If you by blocksize increase mean segwit it seems to be something wrong with it since it has not increased transaction capacity noticeably despite being active for two months now. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:58:22
You are the one doing the mixing up. What everyone here is telling you is that it is perfectly possible to run a network the size of the bitcoin network with just 10% of the nodes. Since the two types of nodes are just ignoring each other there is no rejecting of blocks, the two networks will not be in contact with each other. Both networks will be working fine but since segwit2x will most likely have the most miners and the economic majority it will most probably be the most valuable network. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:51:27
If that was true Core could have increased the blocksize years ago and pulled the rug under Ver's feet. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:06:46
It has also always been stated that segwit by itself is not enough of a capacity increase and thus that a further blocksize increase is necessary. You can argue with this but you can not invalidate the argument as such. Some people are happy with limited transaction capacity and high fees, I assume you among them, some are not and are itching to change the protocol to avoid it. There's a difference of opinion meaning there's no right or wrong side, just different sides.

Since there is a 95% limit for adoption that is probably not the intended way to approach the problem. Anyway, there is more than a 5% minority. Last I checked 10+% of mining hash power was stalling segwit adoption. And an even higher percentage of users most likely harbour the same opinion. You can ignore this minority and refuse to interact with it, but who is stalling then?
@_date: 2016-10-25 06:48:21
I see you are doing your utmost to live up to the troll label r/btc has placed upon you. 
Anyway, your argument is an indirect endorsement of the correctness of my reasoning that the logarithmic nature of blockchain growth allows for an increase in blocksize. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 08:43:58
Well, personally I do prefer a larger currency to a smaller on. Therefore I am perfectly willing to do some compromises. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 20:48:13
Or maybe the 95% is intended to foster consensus. Which means that as long as we are below 95% we should all compromise until consensus is reached.

If you have any real arguments, hit me!
@_date: 2016-10-24 19:13:11
I believe you can agree that less people use nodes as personal wallets in the way we all did in the early days. A development which is probably not reversible which means we can only count on altruistic node operators and business nodes, neither of whom is really resource starved. 
Your math does not seem to add up, depending of the meaning of your wording of course. But the general point here is that blockchain storage is a logarithmic value. It grows less and less over time. Unless we increase the blocksize of course. But this also mean that if blockchain storage is the limiting factor we can actually increase the blocksize and despite this storage needs will keep increasing in the normal linear way. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 14:29:14

Most definately. But I am already synced with a 500 Gb mostly empty harddrive and 100/100 fibre connection. What I meant was that there is not much in it for the network. SegWit might be such a thing, but there seems to be plenty of time before that activates. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 06:40:28


Well. The only thing I have heard of is the risks associated with hard forks. Which are of course relevant. But they are also political risks rather than technical ones. And as bitcoiners we usually scoff at politics, so I see this line of argument as somewhat beside the point. 


Like most, I have no idea about the actual upload bandwidth requirement for a node. I do, however, run a full node and I know for certain that it barely registers on my 100/100 connection. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 06:45:02
I agree that there is no good way to assess consensus in the bitcoin community. Which of course is a major drawback. But this little fault of bitcoin only increases the need for open discussion and working on multiple fronts. Core is, from my perspective at least, forging ahead with their preferred solutions. Which might be acceptable if they were a development team among many. Unfortunately they are viewed as the consensus client and therefore expected to serve some sort of consensus opinion. Maybe it is just a problem of communication, but that is serious in its own right. 
Thanks for the link. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 19:08:12
I have read about flexible transactions from someone named Zander. While his code has been roundly disparaged (I have not reviewed it) there are some good ideas in it. The general idea of simplifying transactions is a good one and in a hardfork segwit scenario there should be plenty of room for such optimisation. 
I do agree with your opinion that a useful hardfork needs plenty of time before deployment. Which makes it all the more unfortunate that the process towards such a hardfork was not initiated already last year, that would have for a peaceful hardfork, including a blocksize increase, sometime next year. The current situation will probably lead to something more chaotic. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 13:54:23
Well. Bitcoin is my country. Of course I can exchange all my bitcoins for some altcoin, just as I can up sticks and move to some other country.

We should be careful with that. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 11:08:34
The overwhelming majority is hard to judge in an environment like this. You could for example look at the list of major bitcoin players and their attitude to blocksize increases here: 
and conclude that you are in fact not in the majority at all. Looked at from yet another angle Bitcoin XT has been around for almost two years now, I assume you are not running it which means that you have been stalling scaling for two years. It is not looking good from someone who is vehemently opposed to stalling scaling. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:15:26
That's code that is not merged into Bitcoin Core and never will be. And more to the point it is not the code that the miners want. My question was why it is so hard to give the miners what they want, code for a 2Mb hardfork at a set date in the future?
@_date: 2016-10-24 19:38:14
Your answer is enigmatic, but I assume you refer to the fact that same size blocks add the same number of bytes to the blockchain, ie linear growth. That, however, was not what I was referring to. I referred to the fact that each new block will add less and less to the blockchain in relative terms. Each new block will correspond to a smaller and smaller percentage of the entire blockchain. This means that the actual growth of the blockchain is logarithmic, it grows relatively less and less over time.

This is simple to answer. Before, there was no good alternatives to running your own wallet/node. Nowadays there are plenty of superior alternatives. 
Seeing this it is also easy to see the solution to the node centralisation problem: Make Bitcoin Core a great wallet again. If people want to use Bitcoin Core as their primary wallet, and at the same time run a node, then there will never again be a problem with too few nodes. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 07:28:59


This is actually rather interesting. Do you mean to say that the people at r/btc do not want a "decentralized digital currency"? If so I assume you are thinking of the risks to node decentralisation that some say would follow a blocksize increase. But this is a contentious argument, in which there are different opinions. What theymos has done then is to take his own view on a contentious issue and forcing everyone else to keep quite. I can only speak for myself, but to me that sounds like a good description of dictatorship.

I spend where possible. Partly to get som churn on my coins but mostly to grease the bitcoin ecosystem. Besides, it is by some distance the best payment system for the internet, even when blocks are full and transaction fees exorbitant. 
@_date: 2016-10-31 20:41:13
I broadly agree. SegWit is overall good, but it would be more natural as a hardfork. And if there is to be a hardfork there are many other things to include, for example a blocksize increase. 
By the way, no one else has mentioned it but boasting about being a CTO without mentioning where immediately made me think of one of the numerous illegal bitcoin businesses, the darknet markets. Which made me think, what are the opinions of these rather substantial players in the bitcoin ecosystem? Are they small blockers or big blockers?

This is well-known politics. If a minority is not allowed a voice through the ordinary decision-making system they will find other ways. A minority that is permanently sidelined in a parliamentary democracy will use street protests instead. ViaBTC is at the street protest level. This does not mean they want to secede. A wise politician at this stage should know that compromises are well overdue. Street protests are messy and they are always a sign that normal political proceedings are not working. We need to make bitcoin politics working again.

Probably not. But it would certainly sway a few. Maybe even enough to make rest relent. And if they do not we always have the UASF army banging their shields. After all, a UASF is much more fun if 60% of miners rather than 30% are supporting segwit. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 13:01:13
Personally I believe that the shrinking number of nodes is due to the double fact that the blockchain is ever more unwieldy (closing in on 100 Gb now) and the proliferation of good SPV wallets. The blocksize do affect the growth of the blockchain, but these days only hardcore bitcoiners run their own node, probably on dedicated hardware, and a slightly faster-growing blockchain will not affect them much. As for businesses they are more or less forced to run their own node if they want to process their own bitcoins. Faster bitcoin adaption will lead to more bitcoin businesses and therefore more bitcoin nodes.

I am not arguing against UASF as I am arguing for something else. Of course I think it's better if people spent their resources on something with a chance of success. But if you have to try UASF, by all means do. I don't think it is dangerous, just a waste of time.

Right about what? The argument is that the blockchain is growing logarithmically while the capacity of disk storage is growing exponentially (we do not gain 1 Gb per year like we did 20 years ago). This discrepancy in growth exponentials allows for an increased blocksize. The logic is simple (the conclusions you draw from it might not be). It beggars belief how anyone can take issue with it.

@_date: 2016-10-24 14:31:03
Doubling the limit does not mean doubling the actual blocks. There will not be an overnight doubling in resource requirements. Also, the biggest restraint for most users is the size of the blockchain, which thanks do its already massive size will only increase slowly in relative terms. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 16:12:44
As you probably saw in the link there was also widespread support for a hardfork, at least the 10% we are talking about here. 
As for the hardfork in general I fail to see the drama around it. A consensus hardfork should be very undramatic. There are also many other things, except blocksize, that could  use a hardfork, as detailed in this link: 
Segwit is probably among these, by the way. As far as I have understood, and I have not reviewed any code but only read specifications, segwit makes things unduly complicated only to avoid a hardfork. Which seems like the wrong approach to me. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 09:40:25
The logic seems a bit faulty. If the larger blocks are filled up that means the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole has become larger, which means that there are more businesses running nodes, thus diminishing the problem of centralisation. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:57:20
Employees are not a correct definition of the miners role. See them as one part of a multilateral government (like the American). A form of checks and balances if you like. If the developers are the president then the miners are the house of representatives (and the nodes/users the supreme court). Nothing can be done if the three arms of government does not agree, this is as true for bitcoin as it is for America. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:00:09
Then I suggest they switch over to one of the altcoins without users. Only then can they truly care for nothing but technical soundness.

I'm not against segwit so your criticism sort of passes me by. 
However, there is no question that segwit will affect all users of the network, regardless of if they use segwit transactions or not. Personally, I don't see this impact as very grave considering the many advantages segwit brings. But I accept that others might be of a different opinion. To state that segwit is a backwards compatible softfork and hence above criticism is either lying to others or lying to yourself. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:05:15
Segwit by itself is very much a bundle deal. "Segwit is the compromise" if you remember the old catchphrase. Logically you can not be against bundle deals if you are pro segwit. A segwit+2Mb deal is just a bit bigger compromise to take in more actors. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 13:11:45
Core has about 90% of miners. But they have less than 90% of nodes. And, looking at Reddit at least, they have certainly less than 90% of active users. Saying that miners work against the wishes of users therefore seems like a stretch.

Nowadays I do spend a certain amount of time on r/btc and in my impression they first and foremost care for being angry. Angry for being locked out of the bitcoin mainstream. But, secondly, they care about decentralisation, against the centralisation of development for the most part. 


That is an opinion and not a fact. It should definitely be discussed, not censored. 


For me personally, this type of splittist argumentation is very irritating. You probably do understand that a lot of bitcoin's value comes from network effects, it being a large currency. Multiple minor bitcoins would have a total worth much smaller. It is in all our interest to keep bitcoin together. But for that we have to talk to each other. We can only do that if we are in the same place. Shutting out a big minority and refer them to a separate subreddit where you do not need to see each other is not only unfriendly, it is downright idiotic. 


You might be interested to know that a few months ago I had never even heard of r/btc, much less visited it. The reason I have now is that r/bitcoin gave me the feeling that I missed out on important information regarding bitcoin, which forced me to look for other information channels, in which process I found r/btc. Hence I do not come to "your" place, this is mine just as much as it is yours. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:38:58
That's not how it works. A compromise is by definition you get something you like for the price of something you don't like (as much). Even if you think segwit is bad you could still accept it if you get something you like, say a hardfork blocksize increase. Of course, not everyone will be swayed by this kind of barter. But lots of people will definitely be turned over to the segwit side.

If you put your money in there you will always have your money in that chain with the rules you signed up for. Other users and other money might migrate to another chain with different rules, but your chain with your rules will always remain, even if it gets a bit lonely.

That's all fine and dandy but I think the miners were expecting actual code, not a discussion of a theoretical hardfork sometime in the unspecified future. Why is it so hard to deliver code that actually sets out a hardfork within a specified timeframe?
@_date: 2016-10-14 18:19:15
Since this is a social and political question rather than a technical, scientific evidence is beside the point. 
And personal experience is perfectly applicable in this case since it is de facto persons who run nodes. If I can easily run a full node on a seven year old laptop while blocks are full, I am pretty sure the network as a whole can handle somewhat larger blocks without a large part of nodes disappearing. Please prove me wrong if you have scientific evidence saying something else. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:50:00
There can not be a bitcoin without miners, no matter how many users there are. Hence miners have a de facto veto, just as the congress. The intention with a UASF is not to do whatever they like but to show enough user determination to sway enough miners to support them (not much success with that yet, but that's another discussion).
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:46:20
I completely agree that cynicism won't bring us forward. That's why we need political compromises, after all we have a political problem at hand and it's only logical that we should reach for a political solution. The only feasible political solution I can see at the moment is SWSF + 2Mb hardfork. This is a perfectly logical solution since the bigblock camp agree that problems are urgent and need speedy solution (=SWSF) and the smallblock camp agree that a hardfork blocksize increase will be needed at some time to accomodate all users, including LN users (=2Mb hardfork). 
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:28:12
If you don't have a problem with staying on the original chain I don't see how you can have a problem with a hardfork. Just sit still and nothing will change.

@_date: 2017-05-17 13:01:47
That is not the only practical path to scaling. In fact it is not very practical at all since the chances of a successful UASF actually happening is close to nil. 
The most practical path to segwit activation is of course to ask the miners what they want in order to activate segwit. Good thing here is that we don't even need to ask them, they've already told us since most of the miners not signalling segwit were also signatories of the so called Hongkong agreement which stated that the miners want 2Mb hardfork code before they signal segwit. Now you may object that the fineprint of the Hongkong agreement said whatever you think it said and was signed by whomever you don't think count. But this is totally beside the point. The miners signed the Hongkong agreement in good faith as they perceived it and they feel obliged to stick with in order to not lose face. Since the thing they are asking for (a 2Mb hardfork sometime in the future) is not very contentious I find it somewhat hard to fathom why we just don't give them that. It certainly is the most practical thing to do. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:13:57
If something extraordinary happens within these 12 months it is still possible to deploy a new version without the hardfork code. If enough people patch in this way there naturally won't be a hardfork. The difference versus now will be that default will be a hardfork and it will take a lot of persuasion to make people not go through with it. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:32:26

If it's evident from the situation you should assume 2Mb blocksize increase does not refer to segwit.

It's not semantics. If you don't have 51% miner support there will be a split. Then you can argue that because your side has all the important nodes and the economic majority the bulk of the ecosystem will gravitate towards your chain. That is most probably correct. But there will still be a split and there will still be mayhem all around. You are of course in your full right to play chicken with the bitcoin network, personally I can only hope there is not too many of your kind. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:51:40
You UASF types seem to think that somehow everyone will get in line and walk across the rainbow together. That's a fairytale. What you are doing is forcing a split and making everyone choose sides. The majority might choose your side, that we do not know yet. But it is still very irresponsible and outright dangerous to force a split as a matter of strategy. History will judge you, or whatever you say in circumstances like these. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:45:01
Then just don't hardfork and stay on the old fork forever. Nothing's stopping you. Of course, your store of value might not be very valuable when there's no one actually using your chain for everyday transactions. But since you only use it as a store of wealth, not actual usage, that shouldn't matter very much to you. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 06:37:54
It's worth noting, though, that there are significant risks with not hardforking as well if it means the stalemate continues. Sometimes a bit of well-calculated risk is the most risk-free option. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 05:24:44
You don't know much about the Swedish justice system I take it. Then I can inform you that Sweden prosecutes a lot of sex crimes and sentences very little. In an ambigiuous case like this the chances of a successful prosecution is non-existent. Something Assange's Swedish lawyer most certainly would have informed him about, but he chose to believe his own narcissism and think he would for some reason be extradited to the US from Sweden (a country without much history of judicial cooperation with the US) when he was not extradited from the UK (the world's foremost extraditer with regards to the US). It makes no sense unless you live in your own little fantasy world which Assange no doubt does. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:25:10
This is all about gaining support. Segwit needs 95% support to activate. Then we have to throw in inducements until we have that support. A 2Mb hardfork is a perfect inducement since it will satisfy a lot of the current hold-outs without alienating many of the current segwit supports (thus making them retract their support). A solution like this will take segwit support a lot higher. If it goes high enough for activation is anyone's guess but I do hope so. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:01:47
As I have already stated it is perfectly possible to play the lawyer and point to some linguistic subtlety which seems to allow what is happening. 
But that is totally beside the point. The spirit of the Hongkong agreement is perfectly clear. The miners want a 2Mb hardfork and they want some guarantees that it will happen. This is written quite clearly in the document. You might point to legal ambiguities, but this is not a court of law. You win no friends and you definitely not win any concessions by pointing out some less than perfect formulation.

Satoshi's original vision was of "digital cash". This is the reason most of us found bitcoin and should not need to be stated. That it has to be from time to time is mostly due to the fact that we are sometimes intimated by the threat of some "digital gold" people, said to prefer the extremely small blocks and avoid hardforks at all costs. I have never actually seen one of these digital gold types myself but they have a tendency to be mentioned whenever hardforks crop up. In those situations it is very convenient to point to the fact that bitcoin is not digital gold but digital cash and hence the conservative alternative is most likely hardforking rather than not hardforking. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:06:14
You are of course free to UASF how much you like. Personally, I'm pretty certain the result will be nothing at all. Which makes it somewhat important to have other options as well. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:43:12
You are missing the point entirely. The Hongkong agreement is not an agreement (obviously since there's no agreement) and it doesn't matter how one interprets the specific wordings. What the Hongkong agreement is now is a blueprint over the desires of (most of) the miners. And from that viewpoint there is no ambiguity. The miners want a hardfork blocksize increase. Even you can see that. And then comes the natural question. Why should they not have their hardfork? Many other users want a hardfork as soon as possible. And even ardent segwit supporters agree there should be a hardfork at some future date. What's stopping us from agreeing on a hardfork now? 
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:24:51
If 8Mb blocks are disastrous then surely 4Mb segwit blocks must be at least bad. Hardly what one would call safe scaling. Of course this only applies if you use logic and reason which I suspect is not foremost on your agenda.

While this particular example seem to have your opponent on the wrong side of things, the important thing to note here is that in the "other" bitcoin subreddit actually has substantial discussion around the subject of bitcoin.

Probably because they want another scaling solution. A solution which the developers are not forthcoming in delivering. Why Core developers, why?
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:39:16
Wait a minute... can Bitcoin Core "force changes onto the users of Bitcoin"? That's quite an extraordinary statement. Sort of an admission that segwit support could very much lower than assumed since the users have only been forced to use segwit code. 
More to the point, no one has talked about forcing anything on anyone. But if the code is there, it will up to the users to make the decisions. You don't have much of a choice if you only have one alternative. If Core really wanted to make sure they are not forcing anything they should present a couple of different implementations for the users to choose from, including hardfork alternatives since this seems to be a desired feature by at least a big minority. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:18:55

@_date: 2017-05-16 18:40:46
You like to say so, but the analogy is still far from perfect. If you by some magic could make all users agree on something you might theoretically be on to something. But in practice you will never come even close to that. In practice the miner's, providing a unique service, are just as able to fire the users as the users are to fire the miners. As long as the preservation of bitcoin as a working ecosystem is of any concern then both miners and users must be considered veto wielding powers. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 12:57:58
This actually sums it up quite well. I am in no doubt about the superiority of the coders at Bitcoin Core. Nevertheless I run Bitcoin Unlimited since a few weeks back. Not because I believe their implementation is technically better than Bitcoin Core but because I believe Bitcoin Unlimited better aligns with my vision of what bitcoin is and should be. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:07:52
This analogy is really only relevant if people had nuclear reactors in their homes. Which they don't. Nuclear reactors are centralised.

@_date: 2017-05-17 11:25:12
A hardfork is always a chain split. The only question is what parts it splits into. For a chain split to be devastating or merely negative we need two more or less equal parts. If any part is clearly dominant then that part will surely take up the slack of the split part. To exemplify: If the chain splits 80/20 it will still be a gain for bitcoin if the 80 part increases in users/value by 25%. We will still end up with a greater bitcoin despite technically losing a fifth of the ecosystem. 
I fully agree it makes no sense to hardfork 2Mb while simultanously doing SWSF. But that's not the suggestion. The suggestion is to do SWSF immediately, since it can be deployed more or less immediately, and promise 2Mb hardfork at a future date, maybe in a year's time or something thereabout, enough time to prepare thoroughly but not so far off as to be insignificant. 
The actual promising will be done by the community through the usual channels. First and foremost Core should deliver the code, which is rather simple since Segwit is already included in all Core code. The only thing lacking is a few lines stating that allowed blocksize should be 2Mb instead of 1Mb after X blocks. Then it is up to miners to actually run this code and signalling readiness for both Segwit and the future hardfork. And when it activates users of course have the last say as to continue using the bitcoin network or not. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:31:07
We're all into bitcoin for profit. But if you never want anything with bitcoin to change, ever, then I agree, compromising is bad for you.

Could you explain in some more detail why it is impossible to oblige the miners in this situation. From the Hongkong agreement it is clear that they want code for a 2Mb hardfork before they signal for segwit. Wouldn't writing up that code be quite a small price to pay to get segwit activated?
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:52:25
Segwit is on Litecoin since some weeks back. Can anyone give a summary of the experiences there? I know next to nothing about Litecoin but price charts does not seem to indicate that segwit on Litecoin has been a thundering success. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:26:19
I'm of the opinion that segwit would have been cleaner and more efficient if done as a hardfork. But that doesn't matter very much any more. It's probably not the solution as such as much as the circumstances in which the solution was developed that stalled its adoption in the end. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 06:16:03
With segwit the size of actual transactions per block will be about 2Mb. But the theoretical upper limit is 4Mb per block which can be reached during adversarial conditions. This means that while segwit only gives 2Mb blocks on average, the whole network, nodes, miners etc, must still be able to cope with 4Mb blocks just in case. And this change is eternal, so if we double the base block size after segwit we will get 4Mb of actual transactions but the network must be able to cope with 8Mb blocks, and so on. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:41:43
It would encompass all transactions and not only segwit transactions. A solution which is only a solution for some types of transactions feels a bit half baked. Also a hardfork is fundamentally cleaner in that it gives users the option to opt out by staying on the original chain. In practice that might not be a viable alternative but in principle I find it compelling. There's no way to avoid a successful softfork except hardforking yourself, and that does not seem very fair to those people who only want everything to remain like it has always been. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:19:09
If you take your time to actually read my post you will see that my argument is that $100 tx fee will kill bitcoin as a payment system. And while digital golders has no problem with high transaction fees they probably have a problem with their digital gold asset being next to worthless. And worthless it will be. A bitcoin that can not be used for payment is next to useless. Sure, you can call it digital gold, since its supply is limited and it is easily measurable. But the world is full of more or less worthless collectibles that all are limited and measurable. Sure, it is digital, but that is not necessarily a strength in this context.

It's not difficult to gauge their intentions. They wanted a hardfork but accepted that segwit should come first. They promised to signal for segwit if they were guaranteed a hardfork blocksize increase later on. Guaranteed in this case means stated in code. A BIP is just a BIP. There's lots of BIPs for increasing the blocksize and most of them are very unlikely to ever be implemented. The miners are surely afraid of being ripped off, something they have good reason to be. Naturally they want security in the form of code. If the hardfork code is in Bitcoin Core there's no retracting the hardfork, it will happen.

Bitcoin Core is the *reference* client. Only they can make any changes to the protocol. It is of course perfectly possible to alter the software and fork the chain, then you get an altcoin. This has been made a great number of times. But now we are discussing bitcoin. And the bitcoin protocol can only be changed through changes in the reference client. Hence a great responsibility lies on the shoulders of the reference client's developers.

$100/tx would completely kill bitcoin as a payment system. Lightning or no lightning would not change that. Maybe there would be still some use case for "digital gold" although I doubt it since bitcoin's value is still mostly as a payment system and without the payment system bit the value would plummet and I assume gold bugs are not very interested in an asset with plummeting value. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:11:14
Of course Core can be dethroned. In a sense that is what Classic, Unlimited and whatever they are called have tried to do. They have not succeeded, partly because the odds are stacked in favour of the incumbent reference client. In contrast to what you say that support is very much inherited, the badge of reference client takes you very far indeed. 
For these reasons it is important that the reference client sticks to the middle ground and doesn't try to introduce controversial changes to the protocol. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:06:11
I obviously can't disprove you of what the future will be. But it sounds like an awful lot of risk to hope that bitcoin will for some reason be able to emulate gold without having gold's killer properties (being yellow and shiny).
