21 employee here: This is not true. You are impersonating people in the Bitcoin space, like Perianne Boring and Adam Back:
This goes beyond garden variety trolling. You are then using these impersonated accounts to publish false statements:
We'd advise you to cease and desist.

Hello, we update events each month. If you have one you'd like to add, please feel free to send me an email - happy to help you: will

Ok, thanks for the suggestion.

They haven't specifically been reviewed for potential inclusion on the site, so we can't say one way or the other, however, here are the criteria wallets need to adhere to in order to be a part of bitcoin.org:
For that reason, we lean to recommend first considering using wallets that are listed on bitcoin.org, and to do your own due diligence to take a closer look at wallets that aren't, by comparing to the things we examine, in the aforementioned link - like making sure you have ultimate control over the private keys, for example.

Which desktop wallet(s) would you recommend to new users, and why?

Thanks for letting us know about your issue. We checked into this and were unable to replicate it using the above link. Here is a link to a screen shot of what we see:
Electrum has Good privacy and Acceptable fees (rather than Neutral fees that you are seeing). Could you please let us know what browser and operating system versions you're using, along with any plugins/extensions you may have running, so we can try to recreate the problem?

I built this because resources to learn more about building with Bitcoin are scattered throughout the web and hard to find. Rich content for technical people to consume is buried within websites, fragmented and hard to pry out of places like Stack Exchange (unless you know what you're searching for). For example, on [ one needs to dig in through the dropdown menu, and then navigate to a series of pages to get to material. On [ it's a similar process. 
So, with that in mind - I've been working with another contributor, Cornelius Schumaker and have put together a vanilla, purely technical version of Bitcoin documentation - it's completely distilled so that a person with a technical or engineering-related background can dive right in and get started with Bitcoin. Thinking there is a lot of opportunity here to do all kinds of extensions to it, how-tos, readmes, more guides, faqs, etc.  
The goal is to make this a one-stop shop for all things technical to help people who already have engineering backgrounds, get started developing with Bitcoin.  If anyone has any questions or feedback, please let me know. 
Thanks. :)

Thanks for mentioning, yes, we should set that up.

No worries, this is now fixed. Thanks again for letting us know about the issue. Nice catch.

Thank you.

We are only including web wallets that allow users to have control over their private keys, and that have source code that is publicly available.
@_date: 2019-10-17 06:29:29
Thanks for the kind words and also for the new idea. :)

Hello, apologies, it looks like there was an issue overnight with the hosting provider. All seems to be resolved, now.

Apologies if that was confusing - that's an anchor link, in case you want to link someone to that specific section of the page (i.e.  The hyperlink to the Bitcoin Exchange page is right below that, in blue.

Thanks for the heads up! Fixed:

If you have time, could you please take another look and let us know if you feel it's clear, the difference between New/Experienced: [
New only shows wallets that are ideal for new users (we mention this in the description text), whereas Experienced will show a user all of the wallets. If you have additional suggestions how that could be made more clear from your perspective, please let us know.
Thank you for sharing the feedback.

If BTCPay is reviewed and added, we should update this text alongside it. At the moment, it seems this wouldn't apply to the 3 options that are currently there.
@_date: 2019-09-16 23:11:12
Ok, understood, thanks for taking another look. The reason we're presenting options to new users is because we want them to begin to familiarize themselves with some of the criteria and features they're going to be encountering -- otherwise, it's more difficult to understand how one wallet may compare to another.
