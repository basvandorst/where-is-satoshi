Make sure to verify the signature of any exe you download from a random hosting site.

There's a project [named Tahrir that aims to do exactly that]( but it hasn't gotten much traction.  Maybe if they had gotten press coverage in Wired by referencing BitCoin and Bittorrent, they would have more support.

LUKS, dm-crypt, TCplay, etc. etc.

Why don't you tell me.
@_date: 2014-05-29 00:51:58
Checking the hash doesn't really do anything.  You need to [verify]( the [cryptographic signature of the exe](

Like [Enigmail and Thunderbird?](  That works on Windows/OS X/Linux.

I like how it also leaks your number of files, and their sizes.  It's not secure at all.
@_date: 2014-05-29 02:43:25
Those hashes mean *absolutely nothing.*  Verify the GPG signature of the file.
@_date: 2014-05-29 03:14:51
So what!?  All that tells you is that your file downloaded properly.  It doesn't confirm whether it was released and signed by the original authors.  That's why you need to verify the GPG signature.
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:40:25
You're probably right

AOSP.

Don't just blindly download the older version without [verifying it](  You can still get the signature for the binaries from [this mirror site]( or [this other mirror site]( or this [github mirror](
@_date: 2014-05-29 14:22:33
It takes just as much effort to verify a GPG signature as it does to verify checksums.  At least one provides some measure of certainty, while the other is a complete placebo.

You need to get ATM refunds if you're losing 2% from your withdrawals.

Some context would be nice.  I've never run into this prompt using Dwolla.  This sounds like a demand from the specific merchant.

I don't think that an e-currency with none of the benefits of BTC will ever take off and attract the users that are attracted to BTC.
@_date: 2012-04-16 19:38:21
I don't.  Services find social network information very valuable.

It's not that elevated at 4.9 USD.  It was at 3 USD for a while, but has been as high as 6 USD recently.

Which is why I suggest finding a bank or credit union that refunds your ATM fees.  I get $15 of ATM fees back each month with USAA, and many credit unions will refund as well.
@_date: 2012-03-15 18:22:12
I know for a fact that [Schwab]( [USAA]( and [Ally]( will all refund ATM fees imposed by other banks.  Any primarily online bank should offer this feature.

The average customer of WU is rather unsophisticated.  I would definitely prefer using BTC to send money internationally if I had the choice though.

You might have better luck just buying them for cash.  Nobody running an exchange wants to deal with chargebacks and fraudulent prepaid cards.
@_date: 2011-12-09 08:50:29
40% is roughly what many cash money launderers take as a cut.
@_date: 2011-05-26 03:14:37
So BTC is acting just like any other small commodity would?  I'm pretty surprised any legitimate investors would sink that much money into a virtual currency though.
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:05:36
He should look into Dwolla.  They've got a much better fee structure than PayPal, and they're more mature.

The Prisoners Dilemma is a perfect example of how two rationally self-interested actors will make a less efficient decision than cooperative actors.  In real experiments or instances of this dilemma, actors are much more likely to cooperate than would be expected.
Just a correction, capitalism as defined "an economic system based on the private ownership of capital goods and the means of production, with the creation of goods and services for profit" certainly exists in most countries of the world.  This is related to, but separate from the nonexistence of 'free markets' as commonly defined.

You can just deposit cash into a brokerage account.  It's not FDIC insured, and is offered by every investment bank.

You sell your BTC for real money on an exchange, and transfer that to a bank account.
