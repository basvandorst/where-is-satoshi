Interesting comment mate, please explain

I researched both Trezor and Ledger looking at reviews and user reviews.  Both came out quite similar but the lure of the backup pack from Ledger swung it for me.  
As mentioned above, if you have more than a few hundred £,€ or $ in crypto then its well worth the investment, especially with the potential increase in value.

I just purchase Ledger X and S in a bundle.  Really happy and easy to transfer my Crypto.

I buy Crypto when i have spare cash.  Its quite easy with the Ledger.

Never leave any Crypto in an online wallet.  I realised this recently and moved all crypto I had on coinbase to my Ledger hardware wallet

Lol, that made me chuckle.  What do you mean by KYC'd?

The opinion of others here is really useful.

I use the Nano S as a backup.  I keep it in my safe and carry the Nano X around with me

It is extremely safe, much safer than having a paper wallet or an online wallet.  Remember if its not your keys its not your coin.
I have both the Nano X and Nano S as a backup.  I keep my 24 word key locked away and that is my security.  I highly recommend the ledger devices.
