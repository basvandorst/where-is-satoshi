Is there a guide to run it on Linux?
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:52:51
Yeah. Go to  and see if you could follow those steps, and make sure your PC is capable of handling it.
We have to do something to ease the congestion!

I think everyone into Bitcoin should participate in helping the network as long as mining isn't an option anymore.

Off the topic, don't forget to get a wallet for cold storage. Congrats, and welcome aboard.

Cold storage means storing the coins offline; whether on a paper wallet, or a hardware one, such as Trezor or Ledger Nano S, and using them is quite simple, with all details listed with pictures on their respective sites. 
Too bad I started buying coins in 2015, a bit late. But it's never too late to buy. Joined reddit recently as I got to know a lot of information here when I googled my inquires. 
I'm not a trader. I just don't want to regret one day not owning a bitcoin at least.

Does this work with other hard wallets, say Nano S? If you did a transaction on those wallets, will they sync? Thank you

Brilliant! Thanks a lot
