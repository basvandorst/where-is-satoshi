Use the bitcoin option!!! Dont just HODL or we will never have a bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:53:12
Current market that is $60 USD, that is worth it to me. It is not hard to get your BCH from BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:29:08
Can you provide supporting material. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:27:21
Same boat I use Bittrex and its much nicer. Just remember what ever you leave on an exchange can be taken without warning. Ive lost money on BTC-E and Mt.Gox that way. Never leave more than you care about. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:22:46
You should never leave your coins anywhere but your own wallet. Even with coinbase who is insured.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:38:19
I just moved from Atlanta to Colorado and Coinbase worked for me in the ATL.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:15:44
There really is no better option in my opinion. Just do not store any coins there and use a Debit card for instant purchases.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:26:32
Litecoin is the answer
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:43:13
The market
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:54:41
Wait till the day an exchange goes down with your money, you will be singing a different tune. I never said never trade, just keep your keys or don't be pissed when all your funds are gone.
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:19:13
give it time, hodl for 1 year you will be happy.

@_date: 2017-08-20 15:38:13
Bitcoin has not had a single red year since the beginning. I can not be 100% sure but if you want 100% go to a 9-5 office job.
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:26:12
Good we dont need those fuckers here. Well wave at them from our lambo's.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:13:26
There is a pizza shop close to me that accepts Bitcoin and Litecoin, they also sell coffee. It is not hard to use crypto for daily transactions if you are motivated. Or how about bitpay? If you want it to succeed maybe you should go buy a cup of coffee and use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:52:56
If you do find it you also have Bitcoin Cash waiting for you.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:57:14

You need to speak with a professional.
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:03:08
Unfoutunalty its buyer beware. This is one of the reason we are a ways-a-way from mass adoption. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:02:09
Coinbase is easier and cheaper. Plus you dont have to spend money driving to the nearest ATM is case its far.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:25:07
Send me the .1 in good faith then Ill send you .3.
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:16:48
lol, you must be new here (thats not a bad thing). Satoshi has around 1.5 Million BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:12:00
The amount of backend development will make your brain explode. It is easier to make a dark market.
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:53:06
I have already done that in Colorado.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:47:08
I have a feeling "he" is dead, or else some coins would have moved by now.
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:24:58
That does not seem to bad. Unless you bought high and sold low.
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:31:20
Your lawyer needs top contact Coinbase.

@_date: 2017-08-03 14:28:28
Yes once I make a trade or I am done for the day I transfer out. It sucks but its better than waking up to a dead URL which has happened to me on BTC-E and Mt.Gox.
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:44:32
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:04:54
A backup is probably the only option.
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:35:41
You can send Bitcoins with very little fee. But how you obtain the Bitcoins is where the fee's are.
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:45:38
Best advice is just put you wallet on your phone and go check it out. You will have no problem using it if you've ever used an ATM machine.
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:53:22
I personally use coinbase because its instant, low fees, dont have to drive and waste gas, no need to get cash out. Its 100 times easier in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:51:44
Never leave coins on an exchange long term. I lost money in BTC-E also but just day trading funds.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:02:39
No one can tell you for sure. But I say its a great time.
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:50:01
The Silk Road, so I guess the Dread Pirate Roberts.
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:43:40
Add paypal then they will send your cash there and withdrawal to your bank account from Paypal.
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:00:40
Money corrupts all, if someone had the keys to those coins they would be moving. But just my dumbass 2cents.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:21:15
Ill try it.

I am not engaging you, you are a troll. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:49:16
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:36:54
Does any where accept CC? I know you can use debit card after its linked and there is no charge back before of the way you authorize the withdrawals. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:48:23
Just download a wallet like electrum then replace the wallet.dat file with the one you have.
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:00:27
Something I learned along time ago don't wait for dips or you'll miss the train and don't put more skin in the game than you care about. (rules for HODLing, not day trading)

12 words that are not limited to character count, the best super computers in the word would have trouble brute forcing that in a humans lifetime. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:44:09
Bro, the wallets are broken, manually adjust what you pay. It cost me like 30 cents to send 120$ in less than 5 min.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:40:26
I want it!!!!
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:23:08
This would be great to know, but I am not sure its possible. upvoted for visibility. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:31:04
same thing happened to me when I first linked my card. Did you have them send the 2 deposits again?
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:45:41
This is how I was in the beginning. It will get better with time.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:06:16
Coinbase is ok, but they do report to uncle sam and have high fees. Just spend your coin at overstock.com or expedia.com
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:11:36
So just download electrum and create a new wallet. Then in the file directory you need to manually remove the new wallet.dat file and replace with the old .dat. While you do this make sure electrum is NOT running. Are you using windows or Mac?
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:56:35
Not that I know of, but all wallets have an option to display mBTC. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:38:17
Dont tell people to buy full BTC anymore, its much more appealing at the mBTC level.
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:07:31
Ya, hopefully when the computer was working (pre-fire) you backed up your system or at least mission critical material to a separate drive.

I just figured everywhere has um, sorry OP.
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:52:53
This also only works for ER20 tokens at the moment so no BTC,LTC,XRP and so on.
@_date: 2017-09-08 05:35:57

@_date: 2017-09-15 10:51:33
I agree I said it would not be good but it would not be the end. Even pokemon made a come back after being dead for 10 years, its a brave new world. Even if all exchanges close there will be many on the deep web and eventually they would come back in time once the government just saw people were trading underground. Also Ethereum smart contracts are making exchanges possible that are 100% peer-to-peer. No one can regulate that if its running on a .onion and you never deposit your money to the website.
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:46:51

You broke the network, that is probably why the price is going down.
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:26:26
Correct, especially after coinbase freezes your account and it takes months to get it working again and you kill yourself.
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:42:02
Buy as much as you can afford and store it in 4 individual wallets. Do not give them access until they are like 18. Use coinbase.com to get started it is pretty easy to figure it from there.
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:37:21
Incorrect, just make things more difficult. Peer to peer transactions is how it started. It would not be good, but would not kill the tech. I guess your new to the blockchain cause for many years reddit was the only exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:48:27

That is awesome, my advice would be keeping adding as much as possible and not to touch it till your 21.

@_date: 2017-10-02 17:15:12
lol, thats what I thought I had them free hand it so there was no sketch laying around. I also did not tell them what it was for and I have one of the words committed to memory and its not the first or last so killing me and to get to the tattoo and brute forcing still wont work.

Go on overstock.com and buy big ticket items and resell them new for a small loss. Also localbitcoin you can find guys to 10 or 15k pretty easy and just do that for a month.
If you have been holding the bitcoin for longer than a year the capital gains tax is much lower.

paxful.com but you will pay like 10-20%.

If you need to hide your transactions dont get lazy always tumble then move into anonymous exchange (not coinbase) and switch to LTC then back to BTC. You pay a little more at the end of the day but your not in prison.

great idea to keep the mainstream from all turning into dirty day traders.

The coins are actually on presale already, 1BTC =1,000 Smoogle coins just send your Bitcoins to 35QQ8oiZUKTBDqme7sEAVUcXDjpsYiXSsX and your Smoogles will magically appear through the interwebs within 7 days.

Just use a local ATM or peer-to-peer sale. Done within minutes.

Probably your bank or credit card provider are declining the transaction. Call them and make sure they are not, then hit up coinbase support and wait 6 months for an answer.

I had like $300 USD in bitcoin I had just sent and went to sleep cause the confirmations were taking to long. Woke up and it was down.

I dont think you understand how crypto currency works. You do not have to pay taxes until you turn it into FIAT. So you trade your Coinbase BTC for something else on Bittrex and now you are not associate with those BTC keys and you didnt pay 10% at an ATM.

He already sent it and I got all his coins.........Just kidding I am not a scum bag. Please do not actually send me your keys.

No problem I tried on my MacBook Pro and iMac 1 little scroll sent me down like half the page.

Shit this is where I live! I don't use that machine anymore because its cheaper to buy from coinbase instead of pay 8%.
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:50:39
I hate to be an asshole but thats why you need a wallet that you control the keys to. If you google Freewallet there are thousands of scam reports of the exact same nature. Try Electrum or Jaxx next time. Dont let this burn you to bad just a $2k lesson.

As long as the wallet supports BIP39 the Mnemonic seed is just as good if not better than private keys.

I believe it is set in stone for the soft fork but that is not a permanent split. If we go to the hard fork well split into 2 coins, which may in theory mean you double your money as long as the exchanges dont tank. 
Hard Fork - A hard fork is a permanent divergence in the blockchain, that occurs when non-upgraded nodes can't validate blocks created by upgraded nodes that follow newer block validation rules. This can be caused by a change in a blockchain's protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and as such requires all nodes or users to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software. This essentially creates a fork in the blockchain, one path which follows the new, upgraded blockchain, and one path which continues along the old path. Generally, after a short period of time, those on the old chain will realize that their version of the blockchain is outdated or irrelevant and quickly upgrade to the latest version.
Soft Fork - A soft fork is a change to the bitcoin protocol where some previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid, and the rest of the previously valid blocks/transactions are kept valid. Old nodes will still recognize the new blocks as valid. Soft forks don't require any nodes to upgrade since all blocks with the new soft-forked rules also follow the old rules, therefore old clients accept them. This kind of fork requires only a majority of the miners to upgrade in order to enforce the new rules.

lmao, I can relate on so many levels. Like everyone here I blew a fortune worth of BTC on the dark web in the early days. Should have held the coin and not bough the pills. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:29:45
As soon as the soft fork is implemented it is then up to the upgraded nodes to try and reach a clear majority and remind us to reach a certain percent of the network hash rate usually by a certain block number. Otherwise, the soft fork will fail and the original chain will simply carry on unchanged.
However, if a consensus is reached, the new rules are implemented across the network and any non-upgraded nodes still mining will simply be waiting their time, rehashing old invalid information both generating and gaining nothing. This in turn leaves the upgraded nodes blocks being recognized as the strongest and the truest chain of events.

Do you use a blockchain wallet on your phone? Once I switched to blockchain the funds transfer instantly, i am still unclear how the ATM is that fast. I think its dark magic. LOL

BTC at least 10k in 10 years, don't panic sell. Just wait for the dump and buy cheap. Like it never recovered when it dumped from 700 to 200.

Good point, never though about it like that.

Where I live there is Bitcoin ATM machines everywhere that provide your coin instantly no waiting for 3 conformations. Or you can try
