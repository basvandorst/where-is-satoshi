Sorry for the confusion. The implication was that by the time the blockchain requires more speed, a future version of the raspberry pi 4 (or an equivalent competitor) will likely be released with hardware that can handle it.

You were lied to by Core. 
Anything up to about 20MB block sizes can still be run on a Raspberry Pi 3B.
By the time the blockchain needs more than that, I'm pretty sure a Raspberry Pi 4B will be sufficient.
The only people who won't be able to run a full node are the ones running nodes on NES and GameBoy.

Paul Krugman thinks all of the problems we have right now are caused by us NOT HAVING ENOUGH DEBT!
Pretty sure that guy is tripping balls 24/7

How much did you short?

More selling depth than buying depth.
Supply and demand.

Buy when people are fearful. We will probably dip below 1200, then correct upwards to 1350.

1) Bitcoin is worth more because it was the first and has better name recognition and a strong "network effect".
2) Bitcoin is more popular because of point number 1
3) Like anything, bitcoin could become worthless
4) Because scary news gets more clicks/views than neutral news. For every 1 person who was not following proper security with their wallets, there are hundreds of thousands who did not have a problem because they used proper security techniques.
4) Ledger Nano S is relatively safe, easy, and cost-effective way to safeguard your wallet.

I can buy 1,024 megabytes right now for little over 2 cents ($0.023) 
In 10 years, you will likely be able to buy 1,048,576 megabytes for around 20 cents.

Explanation please?
