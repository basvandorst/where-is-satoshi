Okay but you can't do any of that with gold either, doesn't make it worthless.

What use case does cash have? Only the one we assigned it. It doesn't even represent anything anymore.

If you knew it was overvalued why are you losing money on EOS? 
I don't particularly like Bitcoin either, it's old. But that doesn't mean it isn't useful. None of these other shitcoins would even exist without it. Respect the papa.

With the lightning network, yes.

Sounds like you got mad bc the market took a dip and you lost money on EOS. ��

Triggered lmao. 
Sea shells also don't have a use but at one point they were used as currency.
Currency only has the value a society assigns it. Bitcoin has an assigned value for it's current use case: it is a digital asset, a digital gold if you will.
It has a use case already, you're just blind and hung up on the "currency" part of cryptocurrency.

Yeah, milliseconds. Visa can only handle 3600 TPS. Ripple 1500. Lightning networm would be virtually limitless became it's off-chain.
