Weren't there only 15 billion dollars in bitcoins at peak price?  You're deluding yourself if you think that would impact exchange rate of the renminbi.  Not to mention, if everyone exchanged their renminbi for bitcoin, the renminbi would depreciate not appreciate.
China didn't kill bitcoin to protect the exchange rate, they did it so Chinese couldn't move their money overseas.

I'm not saying I told you so. This was my first post on this subreddit; I have no comments to hold over your heads. Sorry if you lost money, but bitcoin blew up to the point of pure speculation.

Here's the thing, no investor worth anything would invest in bitcoin other than as a gag or a purely speculative purchase.  What says tomorrow bitcoin will be as in demand as yesterday?  Or in 1 year?  It's purely speculative.  The inherent fluctuations in price is exactly why bitcoin will never accomplish what everyone on r/bitcoin says.  It will never replace the USD as a reserve currency.  It speaks to the delusion of this sub that such a statement is ever upvoted.  
Digital currency presents an incredible opportunity for transactions across the globe or as a value shelter for people in economies facing high inflation, but the real future of digital currency is in stability.  Decentralized currency?  Stagnant monetary base?  Please.  That's not the future, that's just the first experiment to a resilient digital currency.
