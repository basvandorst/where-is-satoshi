thinking like this is like imagining the perfect buy and sell, and belive that somehow alot of people are managing to pump and dump this entire thing without issue.  
Its quite simple logic to sell a little bit when you go 3x in 3 months, so there is no surprise that we are dipping now. 10k is a very psychological-barrier type of level.  
Nothing easier than to sit and look back in time and make up arguements why it would be better to buy on that day, and sell on that day and make up stories that somehow, someone out there is doing this perfectly every cycle..... Some people do for sure, but its far from a big giant ring of traders colluding

So the rollout has begun...
But what does that mean for the average users? 
I mean, when can we expect to be able to pay with bitcoin for a small fee and have fast transactions? 
Next month? Next year? next week? When should we expect this whole thing to be ready for us small time users...

@_date: 2017-12-21 23:25:32
its because they want to be the real bitcoin and take over the whole market, and they think if they kill BTC then BCH will take over...
I think if BTC truly went down, the whole show would be cashing out to USD pretty fast, and reinvest at a much lower price than what it is now....

politics isn't "useless", in fact if more intelligent people were involved in it, it would be good for the people.  
Lazy people sitting on their ass waiting for bitcoin to just replace all the bad things in the world are not doing any good anyway.   
Because bitcoin will not replace politics, not entirelly anyway, ofc bitcooin will have a major impact on policies, but there will still be a need to discuss and figure policies for the people, this includes much more than just finance.

@_date: 2017-12-21 23:36:20
Well, lightning network would reduce fees alot and make everything much faster, wich is the biggest issue with bitcoin right now
The only reason im in BTC and not BCH, is because BCH has fishy leaders and BTC has the 10 year long history that has built up trust.
BCH just launched a few months ago... and cant be trusted with loads of money... BCH is a much bigger gamble than BTC in my view
The thing is BTC has fucked up by not making a solution faster, BCH trying to make bank out of that, hype it up as the next chance to get cheap "bitcoins"....
I dont know where shits goin, but if bitcoin goes down, rest assured BCH will go down as well, and another coin MIGHT get all the money or they will ALL fall down.... 
Bitcoin is THE cryptocurrency... The whole idea of this rest on their shoulders... Even if all the other coins are so much faster and lower fees and bla bla bla, it doesnt matter... 
If bitcoin truly fell... would you buy a shitton of BCH and be like "yeah this is never going to fall, jihan mines 80% of it and only tech giants can run a node at 1gb blocks, wich makes all the mining centralized, this is never going south man"

I see you have a habit of speaking of everyones behalf.
"everyone who watches the video will come to the same conclusion"
hahah, i mean what i linked you could not be more concrete and absolute. He literally says it in black and white, but you are not listening.
You still havent linked me a video of bitcoin jesus saying that software wallets or phones are 100% secure.
Do you know why? Because he never said that because it isnt true. What planet are you living on.
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:34:18
This video 
Enough said. I gave you everything you wanted. Your phone your laptop your desktop it doesnt matter, its not secure.
Lets just agree to disagree, good luck with your holdings lol
I realize you dont want to admit you are wrong, when you are being such a hardliner/stubborn idiot.
But you are wrong, he says "to keep your wallet on your laptop, desktop or any mobile device - thats insane"
But I guess im stupid because Bitcoin Jesus fucked you in your dreams?
AA has said that he doesnt keep more than a little bit in what he calls "soft-wallets" wich mean software wallets. 
I Mean come on, jesus fucking christ, how little do you know. Do I really have to link you every fucking video on the internet?
No. Please link me a video of bitcoin jesus saying that he keeps his entire portofolio on soft wallet or a smartphone. Please link me a video where he says that. Its you who says that bitcoin jesus thinks soft wallets are 100% safe lol.
I linked you McAfee saying my shit is true, now you do the same for bitcoin jesus.
@_date: 2018-05-03 00:56:19
people can belive whatever they want but the facts remain bitcoin has never really had a bad year, the only real crash and bear market was mt gox. And even then... if you just hodled all the way since you'd still 20x at the ATH...
And even if you buy bitcoin you havent lost your money... you can buy dollars for it at online casinos, or just simply cash it out... its not like spending it on a resturant or something where your money is eaten
Who knows what bitcoins potential truly is, but just simply saying its a ponzi and disregard all possibilites of a new skyrocketing price seems so boring.
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:18:15
I guess you have nothing left to say now that i have proved I was right, even using bitcoin jesus against you to prove it
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:08:12
Do with bitcoin? You cant print more bitcoin.
And what nonsense are you talking about? Its in the law that a bank can lend out AT LEAST 10% more than they actually have. And yes i didnt mean max, i mean LEAST.
Banks lend out money all the time that they create out of thin air, and you owe the bank the same amount + a little more, making it a neverending profit for the banksters lol
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:40:48
hahah you are just wrong about everything you say. 
You just blatantly ignored my video where john mcafee says smartphones are insecure?
Bitcoin jesus also says this, so jokes on you numbnuts.
Enjoy when your portofolio is swiped off your "totally secure smartphone" hahah you have literally no idea what you are talking about
There are loads and loads of videos of different people saying smartphones are insecure.
You having no patience to search for this yourself, or being unaware of this well known fact, displays you complete and utter lack of knowledge on the matter.
Its not hard to find, theres literally 100s of hits of videos of different people saying the same thing, Bitcoin jesus included. 
Heres another video i found for you because you didnt manage to search the internet! How will you ever manage to learn anthing in the digital world, i wonder
Dont worry! its shorter so you wont have to skim through!
And McAfee says literally in the first minute of the original video i sent, exactly what i told you, so you didnt even have a 1 minute attention span, hahaha
you are an idiot lol
"At what time? You expect me to watch a 38 minute video to seek a quote to back up your bs?"
Actually, yes, i expect you to spend 1 minute or do at least some research about what you are talking about when your attitude and opinion are so stubborn and stupid 
 in this video McAfee says that storing your crypto on a laptop, pc or smartphone is insane.
Oh man, some people really need to get it in with a tea spoon

Bitcoin was hijacked by the illuminati!
ROGER VER found it out and made a master plan to defeat the evil banksters BITCOIN project!
its called bitcoin cash and he prefers to call it the real bitcoin, because satoshi whitepapers
After selling explosives online to private people
and outing someones name online over 50 dollars
Roger Ver saw through the banksters elite master plan to hijack bitcoin and forked off Bitcoin Cash and listed it as BTC on bitcoin . com !
Dont forget the days when BCH was sold for $5000 - $10000 to noobs, they were told to not worry because its gonna BOUNCE TO THE MOON ANYDAY now and flippening is happening because Roger Ver saved the world after commiting felonies and moving out of USA

@_date: 2018-05-03 14:58:38
Ok, I will give you one point. He actually does say that smartphones are secure. So I will give you that. 
And It is true that you have linked me videos.
In this video Bitcoin Jesus reccomends hardware wallets if you have LOTS of bitcoins or lots of money in bitcoin. So in a sense, he reccomends both hardware wallets and smartphone wallets.
So at the end of the day perhaps we agree to some extent.
"If you have a lot of crypto, more than you would be upset to lose, you should buy a hardware wallet" 
 in the youtube link
He also says "Trezor and LEdger are really good wallets" wich you pretty much said were useless?
On an interesting sidenote, there is a comment relevant to our... discussion.
"The advice here conflicts with that coming from McAfee who says that people's smartphones are very insecure. According to research, 50% of all smartphones contain key-logging malware. So, I wouldn't store any bitcoins on a smartphone.﻿"
Food for thought I suppose.
I will draw my conclusions that smartphones being safe is up for debate, and that there is a higher agreement that hardware wallets are safe. Both bitcoin jesus and mcafee agree that hardware wallets are almost impossible to hack, but they disagree on smartphone wallets

lending out IOUs is not the same thing as printing more bitcoin.  
 "no, the "law" is that they have at least 10&amp; of the money they lend out. "  
Ok. Its still bad. They dont need to have the money they lend out, they just create them. So basically we let them own everything just to have a system. Theres no actual creation of any wealth or anything, just numbers on a screen.  
Banks dont just make a little money. They make virtually limitless money, own all the money that everyone uses and if you want to buy a house or anything you need to go to them first so you can get a "loan" that they basically can just take out of thin air. But if you think all this is 100&amp; legit, nothing\-to\-see\-here\-officer, then thats your right and your opinion. I dont trust them at all and neither should anyone in my opinion.

It's bothering me that so many never-coiners use to this sub to try to explain to bitcoiners why bitcoin is bullshit, I mean if you dont belive in it or like it, why even bother with this sub lol. And its gonne be fun to see all the experts emerge if a new bullrun comes.  
Why is bitcoin valuable you say?? Maybe because there is something about bitcoin you dont understand. It did go from 1 cent to several thousand today... why? No reason?

" This concept is a band aid on the real issues and has yet to live up to any of its claims. It is not anonymous, it is not decentralized, it is not efficient, governments can take it away, it is ripe with fraud, and on top of everything you have to pay a tax or fee everytime you use it."  
Lots of what you said isnt even correct.   
They cant take it away, the cats out of the bag.   
Ripe with fraud? As if the federal reserve/sentral banking system is not??
And no, you dont have to pay a tax every time you use it. Some countries even have 0% capital gains tax on bitcoin if you hold it for 1 year or longer.  
Bitcoin is anonymous enough man, you just have to send coins to a new adress and nobody can prove that those wallets are yours. Or you could turn your bitcoin into monero and back to bitcoin, then they are completely clean and nobody will be able to tell where they originated.  
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:03:53
there's just too many people that dont understand bitcoin moves quickly up and quickly down quite simply due to the fact how it works.  
If there is a shitload of FOMO in the market, people buy bitcoin, then even more people buy, and then bitcoin gets more difficult to mine and its even more scarce for a couple o' weeks, so when there is massive buying the price also goes up because bitcoin gets more difficult to produce.  
So when the buying ends for the currenct cycle, less people buy, bitcoin become less hard to produce, so it drops quickly down in price. The current price movements are pretty normal in bitcoin, so thats why its not for everyone

There also is a fee when you use banks. In my country there is $1 fee to withdraw from minibanks.You are correct you do pay a fee when you send bitcoin, but it is very very small.You can literally send 50 million dollars and pay a few cents in fee. Thats way lower than sending 50 million dollars through a bankingnetwork.
I dont think it is possible to see the IP adress used on a specific wallet. Yes, ofc, if you just use a web wallet where your name is tagged, then ofc they can see the IP. But if you use a desktop wallet or laptop... or other wallets that are not linked to anything, I dont think they can open the block explorer and see the IP last used on that wallet.
But in reality, bitcoin is way cheaper to use than credit cards, in many cases. I paid a  $100 fee to exchange my currency to USD when i bought something through PayPal. If I had paid bitcoin for it, I wouldnt have needed to pay  that fee.
EDITED: You are right there are many fraud exhanges over the years, but if the users of Mt Gox had put their Bitcoin in their OWN wallets, then they would still have them. This is not a fault in bitcoin. It is the way it works, and must work, for it to be bitcoin. If YOU control the key, you OWN the bitcoin, the Mt Gox case is not something that makes bitcoin bad.
r/bitcoin urges everyone to control their own key  
besides, these giant coorperations would say that wouldnt they, that bitcoin is super "flawed", and their system is not. The reality is they dont want you to belive in it.

People seem to think law enforcement actually sits there looking at adress something like: "1kilalqnwldnqmzblan" sent 0.01 btc to "1kaiqhwjkdnbelsbskb" and go "wooooow gotcha!"
In reality, most of them dont even know how to use bitcoin or what it is. Those who do know have No capacity to Hunt down every single druguser.....
Usually they just take down the owner of the market.

We have an entire population not wanting to live in their own backyards... They Come to europe in rubber dingys with motors, who funds those?
Last night on the News they showed one such dingy and Stated it was filled by mostly young men..... Most of them are young men, not women or children. Why is the left ignoring this stuff? Cuz they dont care about immigrants they Just want to look virtious. 
The entire world has gone completely mad. 0 respect for borders or countries or rules, but yet they expect everyone else to follow their beleifs.
I remember when suicide bombs happened basically exclusively in the 3rd world but now they happen everywhere and we do not know when the next will be, thanks to the left ruining the 1st worlds security and control. Now we Just hope that all attacks Will be stopped by intelligence
The world is not so simple that Just being kind brings safety and peace for all and everyone. The West tried to help and all they got was a Split community and terrorist threats and more crime, drugs, etc.

"We" are the People in the countries which borders YOU dont respect.
They are funded by organizations and no way in hell all of them pay 10k usd for it, thats Just BS.
They send mostly men because they Come from a sexist culture. You said yourself that "young men are better at making money to send home" you are a sexist yourself. In fact you are crazy. 
There is more crime and i dont need to source it. You gotta source why there isnt more crime. Its you Who want to bring them in, so you have the burden of proof, not me.

There IS more crime, you have 0 respect for borders or any kind of touch with reality to begin with. Im scared for safety yes because i dont like terrorsts and suicide bombs, but Who cares right? As long as you can feel good about yourself.
We care what gender they are because if we should help People it should be more women and children and not mostly men.
How do you explain that they fund them themselves? Arent they poor because of borders? We are not talking one or two boats but thousands of them with fuel tanks to boot.

Bitcoin might go up n down in value like crazy, you might lose some money... but time after time it just goes to show that over time, holding your value in bitcoin makes you more wealthy.

not really sure what this is supposed to mean, the comments dont seem to make much sense either. If you buy your bitcoin off an exchange it usually requires your id for KYC purposes. Its international law.  
If you buy bitcoin on the exchange, just send it to your own wallet, do not leave it on the exchange. Now you can send your bitcoin freely. You could turn it into monero and back into bitcoin to "clean" your bitcoin to be much more difficuly, if not impossible to trace.  
You might say bitcoin is not so great, but really, nothing else gives you the freedom of paying for what you want whenever you want man.

I did actually think about not having him on there, because it might look like he is a super villian. This is not my intention.

I am merely saying you can hold bitcoin and spend it  at the same time. Is this hard to understand?  
And you are even more confused than me im afraid, holding currency means you trust the currency and it means you are invested in said currency.  
People speculate on currency all the time, alot of people invest in currencies.  
What do you mean "cash is not an investment"? Holding venezuela currency this year wouldnt matter? Do you not mind what sort of currency you hold because "cash is medium of exchange" ? Im sorry but you dont make any sense

@_date: 2019-01-11 03:09:01
What did you just say, I dont understand what you're saying. Im merely stating that by looking at the comments I realize that decentralized currency  is the only option left for a world in wich people are going to be free to express themselves.  
If it were not for bitcoin, Wikileaks would not have received funding for example......  
You can see in the comments for yourself thats its pretty obvious alot of people today like the fact that people like Jordan Peterson gets banned because hes "an alt right maniac who is racist"
@_date: 2018-11-24 01:58:21
it was a bubble all right. Unlike the tulip bubble bitcoin cannot be grown from the ground though...  
its scarcity is still present... its utility is enormous and disruptive against established systems.. Potential returns are also pretty fucking great if you wanna dream a little.  
Bitcoin has bubbled like this loads of times.   
It will probably still be used in 10 years, why wouldnt it? Because it sucks? Because its not even real money?  
Its going to be used in the future because its free and lawless, essentially, and works alongside our fiat system perfectly.

whats your problem with him saying the word "bitcoin" or not anyway?  
He does accept bitcoin for donations. Isn't that enough? I dont really get why you care about it.
@_date: 2019-01-11 03:16:50
I dont care even if he talks about crazy stuff. The man is NOT a nutjob just because he talks about crazy things or has crazy opinions. He's not running around killing people or doing anything bad at all, so whats the goddamn problem?  
Do you agree that is fine to say "good riddance" to people just because they talk about crazy things?  
I belive in free speech and thats why I will not just back down to all these internet geniuses who says its OK to ban people just because he's talking about crazy things.

bitcoin is merely the only option left when the banks/paypal, so forth and so on, ban you.  
Plenty of people have gotten banned off of paypal this year alone lol. Also gotten their money seized and freezed.   
Bitcoin is the final bastion against this kind of tyranny.  
Thats what bitcoin REALLY unlocks...........  
And someday people will no longer be able to use real hard cash, they are working nonstop all over the globe to REMOVE cash so they can surveil your transactions... The only way you will be able to pay for anything "off record" in the future is trading precious metals or using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies..... I do not really understand why so many people look at bitcoin as some ugly thing....... Power to the people in my opinion
@_date: 2019-01-11 01:53:22
comments on this post are exactly the reason why bitcoin is so great, so many of you marxist leftist people just flat out like that people like Peterson has to deal with censorship, yet you are into Bitcoin, I would go as far as saying thats being really phony.Fortunetly, bitcoin is decentralized, so that you marxist intollerant-of-any-other-opinions cant ruin the world with fascism

Banks follow laws? What sort of naive silver spoon kid are you?  
The banks ARE the law. Breaking free from shackles is NOT anarchy. Its liberty.  
You do not know anything. People get their assets freezed because of "hate speech" for example, wich is a very vague definition indeed.
  
You know absolutely nothing and I understand why you dont get bitcoin now.  
You belive you live in a world where strong men doesnt dominate weak men.    
Its exactly the opposite in reality and you do in fact stand idly by while fascism and tyranny is taking place all over the globe.

I hope OP is right, but who the fuck knows how low its dropping? Seems to me like its dropping in general, with a few upticks here and there, and then it just drops again...

Seems like we are moving towards 3500 imo

HAHHA stupidest thing i've ever heard.
Im not starting to think you are an idiot, you've made that blatantly obvious from the get go.
And there are plenty of reasons to have a hardware wallet, its not designed for travelling. I mean, jesus, what the fuck are you talking about 
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:27:38
you do not need to bring the hardware wallet with you to the airport... 
If you really want to hide it you can just bring the seed and load the wallet on a laptop once you are out of the airport and load them onto another hardware wallet
hardware wallets are great and the most secure way to store your bitcoin, its as simple as that lol.
@_date: 2018-04-28 00:56:33
first they say "say the proper name for it! its Bitcoin cash! NOT Bcash!!!!! Thats a social engineering attack omg!!"
And then they seize bitcoin.com, name BTC "Bitcoin core" and give their own shitcoin the name "Bitcoin" with the BCH ticker attached to it.
And they pretend that they dont understand why people hate them so much lol.

trezor is open source my friend
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:36:51
Wow, you seem to be truly on edge. Im just trying to explain my own point of view here. You are truly a "Know it all" asshole. 
Arrogance is what you display.
"TREZOR is a secure bitcoin storage and a transaction signing tool. The private keys are generated by the device and never leave it thus they cannot be accessed by a malware."
Thats from bitcoin wikipedia, man.
And might I ask, where is your goddamn paperwork for your statements? You just repeat bitcoin jesus as the end-be-all of the matter? Ok.
"Hence nobody will take you seriously even a little."
Just because I dont care what bitcoin jesus says? Ok, unlike you I like to form my own opinions.
And McAfee did actually say that smartphones have no security and can be rooted remotely, just by you clicking on a link. I will trust his opinion way more than yours, or bitcoin jesus for that matter.
You just blatantly deny that mcafee has said that. Why? How can you so sure about that? Lol you are just arrogant.
He says it this video;
"So you literally don't have a single reference to back up any of your bullshit?"
I am full of bullshit? Lol you have formed your opinions based solely on Bitcoin jesus (lol).
I am not going to prove to you that smartphones can be remotely rooted. I am not obliged to prove anything to you at all.
Do with this information what you will.
If what you are going to do is insult me because bitcoin jesus doesnt agree with me then thats fine with me anyway.
And if you just use a pin, then thats way less safe than fingerprint, that goes without saying, so, good luck with that lol.
And just because someones twitter gets hacked, that doesnt mean someone doesn't know anything about security.
Thats just stupid.
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:11:28
Matter of fact IOS and android are quite secure? HAHHA stupidest thing i've ever heard.
- "Is that right?"
- yes it is. IOS and Android is not secure from hackers at all, most if not all can be remotely rooted.
And there are plenty of reasons to have a hardware wallet
"For example?"
- spending without exposing private keys, general highest security for a wallet, built in segwit adress for smoother txs
what the fuck are you talking about
"Made that clear."
- Really? You seem to think hardware wallets have NO use to someone who doesn't travel all the time?
And how do you really belive that IOS and Android is secure...
Mobile phones are the least secure device you can use, im pretty sure most security people agree with this notion.

@_date: 2018-12-17 22:13:57
bitcoin is pretty consumer friendly if you ask me, the real obstacle is really just getting verified at an exchange, wich can be done in minutes, actually.    
the biggest reason most people dont have bitcoin is simply; they dont feel the need to have it or use it.  
But everyone who belives in Bitcoin, thinks that this sentiment will change.  
After some time, people will be using cryptocurrency much much more and people will want to also hold bitcoin to store value.  
But people like you can be me guest and just look at it from the sidelines, and not take the ride or the oppurtunity - you might miss out on big gains, but you might also save your money.

value in bitcoin is simply because its p2p and cannot be stopped. There are only 21 million coins maximum, do you really think bitcoin is just going to dissappear?   
Because if bitcoin does not dissappear, then certainly, within 10 years the  number of users of bitcoin is probably alot higher, hence the value of 1 coin is increased.
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:10:41
it is not about politics man, its about fundamental rights such as free speech, if you truly dont see that these people are being wrongfully banned, then you dont understand whats going on.  
This isnt private companies merely deleting a few people they dont like, its a blatantly obvious agenda to ban anyone who stands aginst their tyranny.  
Mastercard has done this many times and is being talked about on r/bitcoin to demonstrate the power of bitcoin. Thats why its so weird with so many folks into bitcoin seeing these bans as "private company rights".   
It boils down to a very simple thing. As long as they keep banning people you dont like, you're gonna say its "a private company rights issue, no biggie" but the day they ban someone you DO like, thats when you will see it differently.

if you buy something online, you have to fill in your name/adress and stuff like that, pluss enter your credit card information, (unless you use paypal for example).  
ALl of this information, your name, credit card, adress - this kind of information gets stolen all the time by cyber criminals because 3rd parties cant keep their servers secure.  
But if you paid with bitcoin, you only had to send X amount of bitcoin to X adress and you are done, no names, no personal data, just pay and be done with it.  
And its borderless and cannot be stopped or seized, so you know your transaction will go through no matter what anyone says or does, and that is power my friend

I do prefer to use bitcoin for smaller transactions like subcriptions for example, becuase there are no recurring payments and your  credit card information is not shared to anyone... I belive  in the future that more people will want to protect their information and thus use bitcoin for example.  
You can already use paypal for this basically, but with bitcoin you feel so much more private and you feel a sense of freedom. Suddenly you can send money/value and its the peoples system being used, not some banking cartel; PayPal/mastercard   who act like douchebags and ban and freeze peoples funds, even though they are not actually criminal, making up stories to slander people and freeze their money

Bitcoin does have some sort of value.  
It's tokens generated from solving mathematical problems, where the transactions go through a worldwide network without any rules or any bosses.  
Bitcoin lets one bypass any border and any government.

because its just crazy shit that nobody understands, it settles transactions beyond government and law, has a limited supply and it works.  
You can set up the same system as bitcoin and back it with stocks? Go ahead.  
Bitcoin is not worth anything per say, yet it settles transactions everyday.  
Dollars are not more than ink and paper, yet settles transactions everyday - and everything is also valued against this WORTHLESS piece of ink and paper... yet it still works lol.  
Bankster currency works and bitcoin currency also works - despite the fact that both are "worthless"...... And you said you CAN setup the same system - why dont u do it? If you can do it, why dont u do it. So many people argue against bitcoin with whatifs; "I can make my own bitcoin so that must mean bitcoin is worthless" Its ridicilous

thats a misconception of what bitcoin is.  
"bitcoin SV" for example is not a "bitcoin system" or anything close to the same thing as bitcoin.  
The proper BITCOIN is 2 things. A currency, and a payment system/protocol. Everything going on in bitcoin goes through and is confirmed by thousands of computers across the world, lots of these shitty altcoins have nothing near the same network size and properties of Bitcoin.

Mr Jones actually is less mad than most people you see daily, totally scripted people with no mind for themselves  
People actually do care about people getting banned off YouTube, Facebook, PayPal, Patreon, GoogleAds, so forth and so on. It is partly the reason why bitcoin was invented - permissionless transactions.  
So that a few brave men can fight back while the sheep walks around seeing everyone get banned and just say "who cares" and dont realize that the world actually has people in it who have a soul and their own mindset and that they actually do care about tyranny going rampant...

I never said he was the brave man, I meant that some people see a bigger picture and understands more of what is going on. One of the reasons bitcoin was invented was to fight tyranny. The brave ones are the people with the balls to  go into this system and promote and educate people about it.  
I also used the word brave for fun lol. And listen man, even if you think Alex Jones is totally nuts, do you think its ok the way they banned him from all platforms in a day? I personally dont think its OK, big tech is playing God, but the sheeple will ofc think its all a-OK and nobody gets banned without being a wacko/terrorist or something, right?
