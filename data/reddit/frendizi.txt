The "first edition" Casascious coins have the first couple digits of the public key printed on to the back of the holographic sticker. Any other coin after the first edition ones have a little window in the sticker that allow you to see the address on the piece of paper within. I think the date on them are 2011 (I'll have to go check), and they use 24 digit minikeys for the private key instead of the 30 character ones on the new coins.

Of course there are plenty of good pools. I'm currently mining on Bitminter, hopper safe and 0% fee. While PPS pools are convenient, the fee they charge really does add up

I think your experience shows exactly what needs to be fixed with Bitcoin before it becomes more widely used and accepted. I feel that Bitcoin is very much still in beta, a very functional beta of course, but there are still things on the "front end" that need to be redone or optimized. I don't think there will ever be a moment when it suddenly goes from being in beta to a "full release", but when my mom or someone less tech savvy can use it without losing their coins, I'd say we'd be pretty much there

If you don't mind which pool you are using, give the Bitminter client a try. Its Java based and once you register an account, its as simple as clicking go and entering your account details. You can find it at bitminter.com. Prior discloser or whatever; I'm mining at Bitminter, but it is a growing and fair pool!

I've bought a couple physical items from Bitmit! I love the site and hope it grows in popularity

I'm kind of new to how bitcoin work, what exactly does this mean?

I've been using coinbase to, the wait on the bank can be annoying, but its worth it for the low cost

Sign up for a coinbase account and link it to your checking account. Even if you're not a fan of banking, it has the lowest BCT-&gt;USD fee that I know of, you do have to wait 4-5 days for it to clear, don't know if that would be a dealbreaker

Instead of trying to follow EVERY subreddit and chewing up all the processing power the bot has, why not follow the subreddits it currently follows, but also just follow the users that put BTC into it. This way people who are going to tip can tip any subreddit they want, without the bot having to scan all of reddit

No idea, probably just a collectors item now that they aren't sold anymore

I ordered the 4th day you could preorder, 6/24 I think. My order number for this was in the  range, but my single is around  the wait begins

This is the flash drive I use for my cold storage wallet, its in a safe and just another barrier between people and my precious coins

After the time and money spent on this thing, theres no way that mug is going anywhere near the top of it, especially with a hot beverage in it haha

Yeah, well I wouldn't have spent $1500 on one year of VPN access if I had know where they were going to go haha. Its all part of using Bitcoin, rather spend it then hoard it out of existence 
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:53:57
Yeah haha, I have a feeling if I paid for it, it would have come a good 6 months later
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:53:15
Nope! Its actually the pools custom mining client (Bitminter's)

I'm seeing a draw around 30 watts on the nose at full draw, not to shabby considering I used to be mining 2gh/s using two kilowatt power supplies

Did you check the address to see if anyone fell for it?
