The argument people are making is that Bitfinex used a typical cold storage mechanism to protect the coins until the CFTC fined them and said they weren't compliant.
In response Bitfinex came up with their multisig system to become compliant which ultimately lead to the coins being stolen.

PrimeDice is one example.  They have a server seed and give you the hash of it.  You then choose a client seed.  Each roll adds a nonce (a sequential number) to the client seed and mashes them all together, which outputs the number you roll.  When you change your client seed, your old server seed is revealed to you, and you can look up every bet you did.  At any time you can change your client seed and both the client and server seeds are locked in (which you can verify because otherwise they wouldn't add up to your roll when you review them).

I don't think there is any evidence of that.  Sure, I can speculate as well that if someone had access to stolen credit cards they could potentially take advantage of purse.io, but Amazaon still has fraud detection to prevent that so its not a perfect crime.

Blockchain.info basically holds on to your **encrypted** wallet and has a site that works client side to act as a wallet.  I believe it is very safe especially if used carefully.
They do not see your private keys.  You do your business, lock your wallet back up, and then send it to them.  You also get your locked wallet from them, unlock it and do your business (all on the client side), and then lock it back up and send it back to them.

1) Rich people already support the societies that give birth to their success, by providing the goods and services that make them rich and furthermore by being forced to pay taxes.  If they split into a smaller state wouldn't they be paying taxes more directly to the society that most helps them?
2) There already are these multiple systems.  There are multiple towns with police, fire, ems, roads, etc.  Splitting things up allows people to choose to live in the most efficient ones.
3) They would have to work through this just like they would any time land is divided.

Satoshi's words make it pretty clear he was not entirely neutral.  He had possible political aims, or was at least aware of the political consequences.
"Yes, [we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own." - Satoshi Nakamoto
In the Bitcoin network's transaction database, the original entry has a note by Nakamoto that reads as:
"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"

Sure, as can happen with any system.  The solution is the remove the government.  You will likely see this happen with seasteading, where seasteads have to CONVINCE people to voluntarily go to them, by offering product, service, or life that people want.

If you start at self-ownership, and then acquiring property through voluntary transfer or homesteading, you end up in a much more sensible place.
People can argue and debate over whether an action was voluntary or involuntary, whether someone has property rights or does not, or whether someone is using force against someone else; but it is easier to come to conclusions and solve these problems than it is to start with government blatantly violating these rights in all directions and then struggle to find a way to cull it.

Ignoring your obvious referral link, the most popular dice sites like primedice and just-dice (before it closed) have provably fair systems so you can make sure the casino isn't cheating you.
What happened today with dicebitco.in was that someone saw their rolls weren't adding up and notified everyone.  The danger of sites with user investment is that the person controlling the server can still scam people.  Thats why sites that don't offer investment are better to play on imo.
Investments are **not** provably fair, and you can't tell if the owner is taking investment money and walking away with it, which is a much larger amount of coins than simply betting users' balances.

The problem is finding what regulation would actual prevent scams.  Whats to stop the government from spending a lot of money on inconvenient rules that burden companies and consumers all in the name of stopping scams?  Because people don't want to be scammed, companies have to come up with their own ways to get customers to trust them.
This is why I know I will get something when I order on amazon (because of their reputation etc) and why a redditor messaging me asking for me to send him something would raise red flags in my head.  No regulation needed for that.

Is there any evidence of this "simple" manipulation?  There are VC funded exchanges with physical addresses that wouldn't get away with a dishonest business plan if they ever had hope of anyone investing in them in the future, and other exchanges offer cryptographic proof of reserve and audits.  I just don't see the evidence of "manipulation", but people continue to use that word and talking about how easy it is to do but I'm not sure they really know.

Maybe large scale infrastructure isn't actually efficient?  Someone could find ways to monetize a three billion dollar bridge by tolls, advertising on the bridge, selling "bridge passes", or maybe big businesses (Walmart, shipping companies, etc) front the cost because they will get so much out of it for transportation that it is worth it.  If the bridge can't be funded, maybe spending $3 billion on a bridge wasn't a sensible use of money, shown by no one wanting to spend it on it.

But I think the parent[s] should have some input — the state doesn’t own your children; parents own the children and it is an issue of freedom.”
That is not an unreasonable view.  Now you can explain to him why the benefits of vaccination greatly outweigh the potential risks, and you can push for people to vaccinate their children, but I think his opinion is based in a sound principle.

EDIT: here's my actual answer
1. We all know roads and fireman are where all our tax money goes right! /s  We have gas tax specifically for roads supposedly, but they have dipped into that to use that money other places.
2. At the very least, the federal government should not be building roads.  States should be able to do that on their own, and yes, I believe they should even be able to connect to one another at the borders.
3. The real response if taxation was impossible is that roads would be built in pieces.  Someone building a housing development would put roads in, because who is going to buy a house they can't leave from?  Stores would build roads because they want people to come to their store.  Anywhere a road was wanted, someone would have incentive to build and maintain it.

All the answers completely miss the reason.  The reason is **why bitcoin exists.**  The things that you can do with bitcoin are so contrary to the way transferring fiat worked.  In order to buy a bitcoin online you need to get around all of fiat's limitations in cyberspace.

People who get in early to things always have a greater reward.  Its like buying a stock and then it raises in value.  It could have just as easily turned to nothing.  To participate in Bitcoin you can buy in at any time, and you don't need to "refer" anyone to do so.  If I buy in for $382, I get $382 of bitcoin, which may increase or decrease in value.
Your second point is silly because it has nothing to do with an MLM and has everything to do with incentives.  If you were selling something on eBay and someone posted it to reddit like "look at this great thing I found on eBay!" would you upvote it?  Of course, because you have incentive to have more people look at what you are selling.  If someone owns Apple stock do you think when they see positive Apple posts they might give an upvote and ignore or downvote negative posts about Apple?  People obviously want what they own to increase in value.
Point 3 I believe this is somewhat true now because we are in a period of inflation.  The system is currently at a point where it is designed for more and more people to come on board, or more and more bitcoins to be owned, less is loses value.  Bitcoin is of course more useful and more valuable the more people who want it, just like **anything**.  The difference is that when you buy bitcoin you aren't in debt, you don't start out paying $100 for the chance to make money.  You buy an $100 asset and it can raise or lower in price, and people are going to try and make their assets raise in price.

It's pretty simple stuff when you figure it out.  On Primedice I know each roll is server seed + client seed + nonce.  The server seed is chosen by the site and you are given a hash of it.  You can then pick any client seed you like and then each roll is just the two seeds mashed together with a 1, 2, 3, 4, etc mashed on to the end.  When you are ready to verify, you change your seeds and the old server seed is revealed to you.  You know it is the same server seed because you were given the hashed version so if you hash it, you will get the same hash as what was shown.  You can then add up all the rolls yourself just as the site did.

Does everyone who complains about surge pricing just not know about something as basic as supply and demand?
When a good is scarce and the price goes up, those who are getting the most value from it pay for it, because they can afford to.  Those who choose not to pay for it do not value it as much.
CEO going to work to make decisions that impact thousands of lives, gonna pay more when Uber is scarce.
Man going to the hospital because he is about to die, gonna pay surge.
Guy drunkenly wanting to take an uber to McDonald's from the bar at 1pm... eh he might wait till the good is less scarce.

Yes, and thats what makes it hard to compete with them.  The governments set up 100 foot walls that only huge companies like Google and Microsoft can jump over (or companies with big backing; keep this in mind when looking at a small company like Braintree, they are owned by Paypal).
However, technology that allows internet anonymity such as Bitcoin, VPN's, anonymous hosting etc, allow people to circumvent certain laws.
People mistake this to think that companies can willfully violate the laws.  They CAN NOT.  They WILL get shut down, owners arrested, and company destroyed.  However, technologies allow people to circumvent unethical laws.  Yes, Kraken cannot circumvent the law, and their users would have a hard time as well avoiding AML requirements, but look to other services that don't deal in fiat bank accounts, and what is able to be accomplished.

2. More Bitcoin companies leaving NY

Just because EVERY single company does not leave, or some people continue to do business in NY does not mean the bitlicense hasn't had a large affect.  It is shades of gray not IT WORKED or IT DIDNT WORK.

Go into r/apple and listen to stories about how much people love their apple products and the "converted" posts from someone who "used Windows for 15 years and switched to a Mac, WOW THIS IS GREAT".
These things are like people proclaiming the death of banks and talking about how great they are for using bitcoin.  Its the same shit everywhere, and is inevitable on a platform where your votes on what people say affect their visibility.
The only thing I will say is different is these things are sometimes magnified here because of the direct monetary aspects of bitcoin.  If you own bitcoin, you directly have something to gain by increased adoption and that will affect how much your holdings are worth.

I find taxation as a terrible method for accomplishing anything.  At its best it is "pool our money and then trust someone to spend it wisely".  It has the massive flaw that unlike a company, the people spending the money get it regardless of whether they do a good job, because it is not given voluntarily.
I believe a basic income could very well be better than the current welfare systems in the United States, but I still have massive concerns with how it would be implemented.  Even greater are my concerns with a healthcare system.  Because a market of voluntary transactions naturally balances itself (because everyone can compete or choose to stop and start paying for things) the first concern is that if the government is picking up the tab, costs would skyrocket, and then checks have to be put into place to prevent that, which will have loopholes and their own further effects.
In a free environment executive pay should not be limited, as no one's pay should be limited in a voluntary transaction.  Why should we tell someone what they can or cannot trade with someone else?  Also restrictions are fighting against what people **want** to do, and lead to things like the entire reason employer based health insurance exists in the United States (wage controls during WWII).
The productivity and efficiency of machines/computers/technology are shared with people in the form of lower cost goods.  The company after all is the one who pays for these things so I don't know why employees should naturally make more because the company bought a machine that produces more.

You are correct in that a free society has no guarantee unlike your idea of regulation which by definition says these things won't happen.
But have you considered why the government will pass regulation that will ensure these things?  How does the government decide how safe to make working conditions?  What does the government allow and disallow?  How do you ensure the government disallows the correct things?
Just like in the case of people being responsible to quit their unsafe job, with regulation, people are responsible for making sure the government regulates the right things, **but**, they have **much less control**.  I can personally make sure the job I work at is safe or choose to leave, but if the government the government could say its safe, or even mandate I go to work even when its not safe, because the government is allowed to use force to enforce their laws.  The problem remains because the government does not always get things right, and can actually pursue terrible self serving goals with no stopping them.

My view on the issue is that I do not support the murders for hire, but it is also not a magic bullet Silk Road rebuttal that some think it is.
Ross took out fake hits on **blackmailers** and people threatening to release stolen information if they didn't get money.  These were not innocent people.  The were not people who "slipped up" or made a mistake.  These were people that wanted to make a quick buck by threatening and intimidating someone, and Ross was left with limited options for dealing with them do to the also illegal nature of his victimless business.  If a normal business was threatened in this way they could go to the police.  Ross could not, and honestly, scammers and blackmailers are a blight on honest businesses, so they get very little sympathy from me.  They are lucky that hitmen don't actually really exist on the internet.

Convenient or low fees.  Pick one ;)
The best method is Coinbase with a checking account, because they have a low 1% fee, but that is not very convenient for you because you don't have a checking account.
The lowest fees would be selling on an exchange, but that is not convenient as you likely need a bank account and possibly to submit identity verification before withdrawing.
People seem to be mentioning all sorts of sites that do every weird thing you can dream up, from reverse crediting a credit card to mailing you a temporary debit card.  This is very convenient for you, but you will get hit with 3% fees or more.
If you like Amazon.com I recommend  where you can buy an amazon gift card and get 3% BACK to you in points.  This is low cost and convenient if you like amazon.  They have other gift cards available too.

Actually with most of the overly pat-on-the-back comments that happen here, this one is entirely accurate.  If sending fiat to buy bitcoins was easy, bitcoin wouldn't need to exist because sending money online would already be foolproof.

He wasn't arrested his computers were just seized.  And its not likely that he was violating the UIGEA, these were not feds it was the Nevada Gaming Commission.
Say what you will but we live in a country where you need government permission to start an increasing number of businesses, and that is a little much for me.

What about when government gets it wrong and people have to suffer?  With choice there is always the option to educate yourself and educate others.  The government is rarely the omniscient force that we wish it were.  What are some issues now that the government is figuring out before the people do?  I find it usually rare, as it takes something to be very well known by the public before the government decides to step in, and by that time the people could have put most of the pressure on themselves, without risking the catastrophic dangers of regulation, such as outlawing or encumbering something that could be very good.

No one is selling private information.  This information is one of the most valuable things Coinbase has why would they sell it?  Its like people thinking Facebook "sells your info".  No, they hold onto it fucking tightly and let people use their ad networks to do targeting, but they never give it up... its the most valuable thing they have.

It has been erased from history that in the weeks leading up to MtGox's demise, they were trading at a price $100 higher than any other exchange.  It was because fiat withdrawals weren't processing so people were buying bitcoin in order to get it off the site.

Just sounds to me like it would double the risk factor.  Now if you or they lose the half of the key, all the coins are lost.  Like if you can keep half a key secret, you might as well keep the whole thing and trust no one.

Truecrypt, create encrypted container that your bitcoin wallet is in.

I've said it before but its a "pack your own parachute" situation.  Coinbase imo is probably the most reputable Bitcoin venture and would likely be able to overcome most attacks/mistakes/accidents.  However, if the worst case scenario happens, they could in theory lose your coins and you would have no recourse.
When you store coins yourself, (or even in blockchain.info wallets as they do not have access to your unencrypted wallet) you know that if you mess up, its your fault; but if you everything right, you can be very certain your coins are safe.

Or even that they could ever make decisions better than people themselves.

Nope, blockchain does not hold onto people's private keys.

Coinbase is probably the most trustworthy "cloud" storage in existence right now.  They have tons of venture capital money and have been operating legitimately and smartly as a real business.  However, at the end of the day, if they fuck up and someone steals bitcoins from them, you are going to pay the price (unless they are really nice and decide to cover the stolen coins but keep in mind this is not guaranteed or claimed anywhere).
It's kind of a "pack your own parachute" kind of thing.  If you store bitcoins yourself, and do it right, you can be sure that they are secure as you would personally only have yourself to blame.  If an online site loses access to your coins, you can blame them but will still personally take the loss.

You're already being charged to drive on the roads, either by taxes or by tolls, or usually both.


In a world where there would be "road companies".  You would likely either pay a yearly fee to use the roads, or maybe roads could be paid through advertising revenue alone?  Regardless, there is plenty of potential for road owners to have contractual agreements with you for set prices and it would be unlikely that they would spend money monitoring every single car to try and take advantage of people driving their pregnant wives.  Making a little money off of someone would likely be negated by the bad publicity that came from it.  It would be a bad business decision.

Blockchain.info is kind of a hybrid wallet and actually quite safe.
All the important bitcoin related things happen within your own browser, and not through them.  When you use they're service, you get your encrypted bitcoin wallet from them, unlock it in your browser, do your business, then lock it back up and send it to them for safekeeping.

It's a "always pack your own parachute" situation.  If you rely on them, and they lose your coins, you have to hope they are able to reimburse people and don't go out of business.
If you store coins yourself, and you fuckup, you know the blame is soley on you but you can also do it right and know that for a fact.

When people use the term "the market", we're not just passing the buck off to some imaginary thing that we hope will save us.
Markets are made up of people.  These groups of people (known as a market) can decide interest rates by competing with one another.  Not sure what you mean by "company towns" but it kind of sounds like a shopping mall with residences that people would live in, which sounds alright, and lastly the Great Depression (and the most recent recession) had a lot of government factors that lead to them happening.

Blockchain.info is basically a wallet that runs in your browser, and they hold on to a copy of your wallet, but it is encrypted by you.
When you want to do Bitcoin stuff, ELI5, they send you your wallet, you unlock it, do all your transactions, then, when you're done, you lock it back up and send it to them to hold.  You are in control the entire time.

You would create a hash of the file... and then sign a message that says "this is the hash of my passport and my bitcoin address is XXXXXX, my passport is linked at  or attached to the email I sent you.  The hash is 1188f67d48c9f11afb8572977ef74c5e"  Then they can hash the file, confirm it is the same, and know it is the file that the owner of this bitcoin address was talking about when they signed the message.
