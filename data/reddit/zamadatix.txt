Well you see on the day we decided 1 BTC was too large 1 BTC = 2783 dollars so therefore, too keep things simple to convert that day, we set a wickle to $1. /s

BCC only has value if people decide BCC is actually equal to BTC. That you'll have as many BCC as BTC doesn't mean anything, BCC is still only worth what people think BCC is worth and BTC is still only worth what BTC is worth.
If anything automatically accepted forks mean you have the same amount of money but are now forced to use every new fork that comes out or lose it. Nobody wants to do this so the new forks are all worth nothing, coinbase can have all my nothing.

Even if this were true over a long term period unless both currencies went above their initial value it would imply you must always follow all splits or risk losing value over time (which seems pretty unattractive on top of that constant instability). Even if you didn't agree with this every split can't always create more value forever, it's only something that can work when the currency groups involve represent a small portion of the overall wealth of society. In a long enough time frame any significant representation of value will stay within range of the output of society - if it doesn't it doesn't represent value.
Now all that aside it does create trading opportunities if you feel you can predict the very short term movement decently well but betting splits are going to increase value more often than not is a poor way to start thinking about it.

No, cashless society is the idea of getting rid of physical cash. You're thinking of something else:






‘the age of the cashless society’

Agreed, but they already have the options available and I wasn't advocating limiting them I was explaining why none have been choosing the option to exchange their product at below market rate for your BTC and why they would be unlikely to in the future.

- Nobody wants their entire life's transactions to be public
- Volatility
- Knowledge requirement
- Transfer fees
- The 5 million other cryptocurrencies that keep popping up
Don't get me wrong, it's great progress and good to use but expecting those that have had to or chosen to cling onto cash to be the early adopter target is silly.

If a business accepted the idea that holding onto bitcoin was an attractive financial idea why would they want to pass part of the profit onto the customer vs investing product profit in BTC directly? If somehow it's advantageous to the business why would the customers want to use BTC over normal currency and holding their BTC?
But let's say for some reason it caught on like wildfire and a few years later BTC is used for most exchanges; you say this is because holding onto BTC was more attractive than spending it. Well either BTC has flattened and the discounts are gone or nobody wants to create actual value (products, services, and such) because they want to hold onto it. Deflation has it's own economic risks and consequences. Let's get back to the "and now BTC has flattened", alright then why not start switching the &lt;altcurrency&gt; that is new and the common bet for deflation? We could do this forever, and it would basically be like an inflation factor pushing you to trade your currency to the newest currency at some loss or at some risk of loss.
Simply having a new currency doesn't create **value** to society, you can ride small **short term*** trends (basically generic investing) but any time you start talking about entities in society with long term planning like (most) people or businesses the bet on creating products or services that they've proven they already can is a more stable long term bet.
tl;dr if businesses were interested in BTC as a holding investment they'd do it directly with their equity not try to bargain on the sale of their profit making products for it. Dedicated investment firms exists for the type of investment you are describing.

Well yes... if you can't understand why they think it's an incentive maybe you should read their arguments? It's fine to disagree or support counterarguments but if your argument is literally your ignorance on opposing ideas being used to paint the opposition as clueless then you are the one that looks like a fool.

Unless people actually think the changes in BCH make cryptocurrency more attractive/reliable/whatever. But I'm with you, not enough people are interested because it's a better coin vs "free money".

I imagine similar situations have killed soldiers of most armies in most countries considering the scale of things.
