If code changes, hashes in git change. It's easy to detect. In addition, the way the software is built, independently and deterministically by many individuals who sign their product, ensures that tampering is pretty easy to catch.

Tax is just a tool. The problem is for decades governments have failed to implement taxation and protect representation. They tax some people too much and others too little. Today, people are largely unrepresented by the governments they support.
By bringing personal choice into taxation, Bitcoin will force governments to consider what activities they are doing that are wasteful or are otherwise not providing value and where there is potential to fix things. It doesn't require some kind of tax revolt, just knowledge that hiding and using money will get easier not harder in the future. With that government will hopefully understand again that balance is required between tax and value provided.

If it's not clear how you'll make money from the user, giving away crypto gives the wrong impression, that it's worthless or a scam. Certain exchanges have given away a lot but it makes sense because they'll obviously make it back on fees above a certain amount of volume.
You might go the faucet route and send smaller amounts or help people open up lightning channels prefunded with the 10 in BTC. Maybe it'll be enough to pay for a shirt or dinner later.

It's mostly shitcoin bagholders. They can't sell directly for fiat but instead have to move through BTC so they do that, increasing the supply of btc to the market (after of course crashing their shitcoin). This is why Bitcoin dominance is going up, the shit is less liquid so falls faster.
Of course it works the other way as well. A lot of Bitcoin's latest rise was money that came out to play and needed BTC or ETH first. Welcome to crypto.

You don't have to worry about any of that. Energy consumed is basically whatever the price is times the number of coins mined. So for the people complaining about power consumption, short or sell and you can help reduce it. Otherwise, just wait for a halving and hope the price doesn't moon (as it most certainly will).

Well if we're going to have a global volume metric it should probably take into account that some volume is fake or cheap to fabricate. Fees paid? Exchanges could publish fee level per trade or candle.
The other thing is units, and though I'd like BTC, USD is probably still best for communicative ease.

We've likely heard anything he might come up with (FUD) and it might fall short term but just as Turkish are following a narrative about external forces messing with them, Bitcoiners would know a similar narrative to be true and probably trust BTC more as it survives even a presidential level attack.

Everything around Bitcoin has a healthy amount of manipulation and noise around it including a halving. The signal that less Bitcoin is truly going to be produced over time may take a month or a year or in the case of smaller and smaller halvings many years, but it does eventually get through to the market. Hopefully you'll be hodling through it all.

@_date: 2017-02-09 15:23:19
If you can't withdraw BTC from an exchange, you have to sell to get the value out so that creates sell pressure. That's the effect that will work over the 30 days. Longer term trust is diminished in Chinese exchanges and elsewhere that central bank action is plausible. That actually may increase prices as less coins will be held on exchanges. Then just today you have the panic sells so expect this dip which could go deeper as people figure out the above. Good luck to all traders.

Try to imagine designing your wallet with maximum traceability. You'd use a signature form of transaction and try to keep payments separate if at all possible.

This is tentatively good news. They have given up on larger block sizes as their scaling path and are instead starting to optimize their use of blockchain space. More analysis is required though. If anyone would care to post some outgoing CB transactions it would help with said analysis.

It's the wrong question. A better one is, what fraction of the Earth's population can use Bitcoin without having to trust a centralized 3rd party and what can we do to increase that fraction? 
@_date: 2016-03-14 06:34:38
Clearly you missed the point so here it goes. The problem with such a coin is that it is not secured by proof-of-work. Instead there's a whitelist of nodes somewhere that can make Arsecoin and that are blessed to sign transactions. When one of those nodes goes rogue or is hacked or a malicous one added to the whitelist, you're in a worse state than the current centralized systems to which they will then have to failover.

@_date: 2016-01-18 17:30:07
It's actually an attempted coup. It would set a dangerous precedent. For example, imagine Classic goes ahead with the fork. What's to stop Bitcoin Free Money, which raises the block reward, from following the same game plan. Whoops there went not just decentralization but also the fixed money supply. It's a slippery slope but unlike most, this one is very real given who's threatened by a successful Bitcoin.

The block reward is an incentive to mine and adopt the currency, build things for it, etc. Without it, or with any easier schedule, there would be less interest. It's a balance however. Make halvenings too frequent and you turn off later users who may see it as a fraud. (see instamining).
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:37:35
You can use your phone but by all means use a secure operating system on your computer, allocate funds to minimize exposure, etc. SPV, like zero confirm, just isn't guaranteed in Bitcoin's security model in the same way as running your own full node and waiting for a proper number of confirmations.

Problem is, there are certain tragedies of the commons. Economic value is not one-dimensional. Trusting the market should take the form of altcoins that are not Bitcoin. Trying to fork Bitcoin itself with anything less than consensus is reckless and irresponsible.

True. I remember the convo and the spectre of a millibit and then the overreaching bit. Thing is you can't really mold language like that.

Simply put you can create your own LN nodes. Coercion is not possible against LN nodes because you have signed Bitcoin transactions for every state of your local channel and can broadcast it anytime.
PayPal definitely has fees everywhere.
As you seem to understand, Bitcoin's strength is decentralization not online shopping unless the product can't be purchased with PayPal. Main thing is keeping your money in a currency that cannot be inflated or debased by an insolvent government.

Unlike gold, bitcoin can be delivered quickly and cheaply. This makes going fractional much more dangerous in practice because of bank runs. Everyone is basically learning how to be a hodler and if someone else is going to be holding on their behalf there better be a really good reason.
@_date: 2016-06-26 05:25:36
I use price as a short hand for liquidity. You're not going to have significant market depth at such a low price because it would mean too many % of total mined bitcoin sitting on an exchange. If one of those big companies wants to dip their toe in the Bitcoin swimming pool, you're right, they're not going to be do with by attempting to spam the network. They'll look at it as a currency hedge and *that* will require greater market depth, and *that* will require a higher price.
On the transaction capacity issue, upgrades are forthcoming and at several stages in the pipeline to follow. CSV, Segwit, Lightning. Sidechains and again for your primary named concern, confidential transactions.

Assuming Bitcoin Core which is really what you should be using. Since you asked minimum:
* 2gb of ram
* 10gb disk space if pruning to say 2000 blocks. No need to keep the entire blockchain on disk for most uses. 
* A few days. You'll want to check in on progress often in case anything gets stuck 
Final note. Run a node for you, not for the network. It's how you can use Bitcoin with best security and privacy!

@_date: 2018-06-25 06:28:23
This is a pattern with exchanges. They start out all easy, no KYC, then one day want banking relationships so start asking for then requiring info to get your money out. There's usually a period of time where you can get your money out before the full KYC requirement kicks in so you basically have to pay total attention to where your money is.
IMHO it's fair to freeze an account for trading and deposits once they've crossed the threshold but they should allow withdrawals from those frozen accounts. Otherwise they just invite lawsuits.
Theft should be called out.

Appreciate your openness. I'm probably not going to try and play this market but the issues you brought up and the different perspectives involved are interesting. 
I see it as battle of liquidity. If the spot market can be manipulated then it makes more sense to provide liquidity there and really the only way to do anything but buy is to buy so you can sell later. So the spot market I consider to be in for some serious gains.
If the futures market is lower than a buyer thinks they will drive spot then it make sense to buy the futures first.
I can imagine lots of oscillations until liquidity is similar on each.

There are two main types of off-chain transaction. Those that require trusting a third party and those that don't. An example of the former is Coinbase who holds a bunch of people's bitcoin. Transfers between their customers are instant because they can be recorded internally in their own database. The risk though is that they may disappear or freeze your balance for some reason outside your control. 
The second type is a payment channel (used by streamium and in theory by the lightning network). There, an initial funding transaction happens on-chain followed by a series of payments that are held off-chain until there is a disagreement or the payment needs to  be finalized. In this case there is less risk of the coins disappearing and effects can be instant but it requires a little more work and connectivity to handle the payment. 
Both are ways of saving money on Bitcoin network fees and supporting smaller, more continuous transactions. For example, watching a video, paying for bandwidth or a piece of gum. 
The first one is pretty well figured out while the second is in active development. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 07:05:12

Part of Bitcoin's unique value prop is being able to hold it yourself. Like cash, but mathematically scarce with tons of options to secure coins. Cold wallets, multisig, etc. The other side of this is that coins left with a custodian like an exchange, could be sold or confiscated. That would make the exchange in question insolvent which could mean nothing for you, or it could mean you losing all the paper bitcoins.

MadBanker01 doesn't seem to be making the point you're arguing against. It's generally understood that bitcoins aren't valued directly because of the cost to mine. Estimates of the reward to mine are related to chain security so it's long term related which is closer to the point.
On the transaction fee side, onchain transactions are still needed to onboard new users to lightning or to make capacity changes to channels. Lightning just takes the scaling challenge from the transaction scale to user scale.
When fee pressure returns part of what will support them is the utility users in aggregate can get from their lightning channels. The speed/efficiency gains are significant so we might expect users to be willing to pay more for them. Onchain fees should then increase as people start bidding to essentially open a lightning account vs. moving coins one time with Bitcoin's standard timing/security arrangement.

Fundamentally both are investments so let's look at each from an investor perspective. 
Mining makes sense if there is cheap electricity and you could turn a reliable profit long term and keep those profits in BTC. 
Fighting poverty makes sense if the poor are relatively young and could provide a return on the antipoverty investment over the rest of their collective lives.
There are many unknowns.
Buy Bitcoin.

I'm with you on the distracting nature of the block size debate however, no constituency or piece of Bitcoin is "everything". That's why it's anti-fragile.
Miners can delay or include transactions, or orphan blocks with offending transactions. Nodes have relay policies that give them some power. Users in the end value a system like Bitcoin more or less on how useful it is which and that value is the ultimate check on fuckery of all sorts.
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:23:29

@_date: 2017-09-13 05:03:26
Yes they will add that block but if enough other miners do not build on top of that block, their chain will eventually have more work than the one that does.
Nodes follow the chain with the most work so once the censorship chain has more work, the nodes will follow it and it will be like the offending block and transaction it included never happened. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:01:27

One thing that is assumed from a social perspective but isn't guaranteed technically is that the number of coins is limited. The last couple of years saw miners and users battle for control to ensure that the system stays decentralized enough and that important parameters can not be unilaterally modified. Each halving has occurred in a different crypto world but since there are definite losers and winners with each I like to think confidence rises or falls with halving events as an input term to price.

If I run a node, I can choose which rules to live by. So if doesn't matter what % of nodes do anything else. I may have trouble connecting to miners to either give them my transactions or download their blocks but that's solvable independently from how blocks are put together.
Edit: a cartel of miners less than 100% but greater than 50% can effectively censor by orphaning blocks that include contraband txns.

The edge isn't only technical.
There is no other team as knowledgeable, competent, and productive as the one that works on Bitcoin Core in the space.

They don't want you to, and you shouldnt, use them for storage but in order to sell they have to be on their exchange somehow and they have little power to make you take them if you don't sell within x days. So some people keep them there way too long and if said exchange gets hacked or goes out of business they lose coins.

It would really help if some charities displayed a list of recent donors or even just a text field. The seller could then supply a random string and that string appearing on the charity's recent donations would prove that it had been done. The only real wrinkle is that some scammers might use stolen credit cards with the charity if there's a prospect of getting btc out of it.

It's true that it takes some bitcoin to run an LN node but the amount can be minimized by doing something like the maker taker model in trading. By adjusting the fee the node charges in each direction it can try to balance payments to keep that net in a comfy place.
