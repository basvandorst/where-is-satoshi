If you care to read the post, I have mentioned Genesis mining as a still working site, and is still paying users.
What point I am trying to focus here is that, no one can guarantee about a website which will always pay.
Most of the cloud mining websites will be offline when they have reached a heavy profit margin.
Eg. HashOcean.com , this site was ranked 9/10 best cloud mining site, worked for about 9 months. And suddenly one day, you go over that domain and its offline. Big scam here, but no one can do anything about it cause the currency is anonymous and decentralised.
Can anyone guarantee that Genesis Mining or any cloud mining website will stay online and will be paying till the end of this year? -no one can 
Here only option that you have is to buy your own hardware and mine through it or directly buy bitcoin or any other crypto. Again to emphasize, crytocurrency transactions are anonymous and there is no government ruling it so you can't complaint anyone or shout. Here trusting anyone and sending them money is risky, trusting on yourself will be a better choice.
Not necessary that if you want to earn, you need a big mining farm. Buy a mining unit (antminer and so) mine profitable currencies and then grow accordingly. Here, you wont suffer more loss even if the currency rate drops cause you can decide what to mine anytime you want. There are a lot of people to willingly help out setting up your rig and choosing right currency.

Exactly! Buy bitcoins with the money you got and when you have bought bitcoins that's your investment! Going for cloud mining means finally losing all your money..
Buy hardware for yourself, if you are interested in earning bitcoins or any crytocurrency . People don't get it, and lose their hard earned money cursing bitcoins.. Whereas the anonymity of the cryptocurrency is its feature, ponzi sites use it for scamming people.
