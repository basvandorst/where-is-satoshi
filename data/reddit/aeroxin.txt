Well, you see. Hillary Clinton is a greedy lizard, but she has a debt to pay off to *Them* for preventing their media cronies from giving her any negative publicity about her Benghazi Scandal. She has deep ties to the financial institutions and so she convinced them to pump and dump bitcoin so that she could pay off her debts to *Them* using her crypto gains. Hillary Clinton is destroying our bitcoin.

Well, it all comes back to the Deep State...

I agree with you, but still:

Dude. Stop. Really? That is an awful idea.

Thanks! I tried 2.0 after it was released but there were still some issues I had with it just being a fundamentally unrealistic game. I'll try out these mods.

What mods, if you don't mind me asking?

Schnorr sounds like a race in Stellaris.

Yes, let's make one of the perpetrators of the 2008 global financial crisis our Jesus.

Wow, you guys are a little harsh. This whole cryptocurrency thing is pretty new to the world; I wouldn't hold it against someone for not knowing all the ins and outs.

This is brilliant. Well done. :)

Definitely not true of *everyone.* A very substantial portion of people here want bitcoin to go mainstream because we truly believe the technology will make the world a better place much like the internet did. Not everyone is here to make a quick profit.

Seriously. It is bewildering to me that people like this guy and Jamie Dimon still have their jobs almost ten years later. They should be in jail.
