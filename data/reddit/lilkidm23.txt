The fund aims to give away $86 million worth of Bitcoin, and has already given $20 million worth of the currency to 13 organizations, including million-dollar donations to the Water Project, which provides clean water to people in sub-Saharan Africa, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights watchdog.  These donations can be verified thanks to Bitcoin’s digital ledger system, which records every transaction in a public database.

That's funny. I just opened your Twitter to ask how that was coming. Nice to see it's apparently coming along well.

Regardless of where you keep it, your Bitcoin is pretty valuable.....Over the years, the price of a Bitcoin has gone up a lot. However, you can own as small of a slice as you want..... Unlike other apps, most of our buys and sells happen in seconds.

This down from highs of $50 per transaction when the spam attacks were at their height approximately 3 weeks ago. This has caused significant congestion on the network due to the volume of users and transactions Coinbase processes on a daily basis.

Besides bringing respite, the comment also brings clarity to a barrage of contradicting statements from government officials from multiple ministries who have backed or opposed the ban on cryptocurrency exchanges, originally proposed by Korea’s Justice Ministry.

Great to see competition to the trainwreck coinbase. I hope you get lots of customers. BTW, Satoshi Nakamoto is a male name, so you need to correct the pronoun in your slide to "he" instead of "he or she".

The next level of resistance is $10,000, and a break back above that should bring further buying to the table, suggesting near-term upside to $14,500, a 70 percent jump from its current price. Many disregard bitcoin but most do not disregard blockchain technology.

Just want you to know the ONLY reason I am waiting for Samsung is because of how you forced btrash down everyones throats, created an enormous loss of confidence with Roger Ver and helped crash the market.  Now I am motivated to mine instead, but I will not buy from you!

Exactly this.  The pro regulation theme being touted by crypto-twitter is a double edge sword. People looking to build legitimate businesses transparently should be lauded. But the idea only a SEC approved ICO is valid is antithetical to the decentralized promise of crypto.

Setbacks such as a sharp price correction or a government writing burdensome regulations are often exaggerated as fatal blows.
